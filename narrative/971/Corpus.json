It describes his maturation, his loves and his eventual career as a professor at an all-girls school.\nThe story starts off with a letter William has sent to his friend Charles, detailing his refusal to his uncle's proposals to become a clergyman, as well as his first meeting with his rich brother Edward. Seeking work as a tradesman, William is offered the position of a clerk by Edward. However, Edward is jealous of William's education and intelligence and treats him terribly. By the actions of the sympathetic Mr. Hunsden, William is relieved of his position and gains a new job at an all-boys boarding school in Belgium.\nThe school is run by the friendly M. Pelet, who treats William kindly and politely. Soon, William's merits as a professor reach the ears of the headmistress of the neighbouring girls school. Mlle. Reuter offers him a position at her school, which he accepts. Initially captivated by Mlle. Reuter, William begins to entertain ideas of falling in love with her, only to have them crushed when he overhears her and M. Pelet talk about their upcoming marriage.\nSlightly heartbroken, he now treats Mlle. Reuter with a cold civility and begins to see the underlying nature of her character. Mlle. Reuter, however, continues to try to draw William back in, pretending to be benevolent and concerned. She goes so far as to plead him to teach one of her young teachers, Frances, who hopes to improve her skill in languages. William sees in this pupil promising intelligence and slowly begins to fall in love with her as he tutors her English.\nJealous of the attention Frances is receiving from William, Mlle. Reuter takes it upon herself to casually dismiss Frances from her school and hide her address from William. It is revealed that as she was trying to make herself amiable in William's eyes, Mlle. Reuter accidentally fell in love with him herself. Not wanting to cause a conflict with M. Pelet, William leaves his establishment and moves out, in hopes of finding Frances.\nEventually bumping into his beloved pupil in a graveyard, the two reconcile. William gets a new position as a professor at a college, with an exceedingly high wage. The two eventually open a school together and have a child. After obtaining financial security, the family travels all around England and settle in the countryside next to Mr. Hunsden.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Professor, by (AKA Charlotte Bronte) Currer Bell\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost\nno restrictions whatsoever.

A first attempt it certainly was not, as the pen which wrote it\nhad been previously worn a good deal in a practice of some years. I had\nnot indeed published anything before I commenced \"The Professor,\" but\nin many a crude effort, destroyed almost as soon as composed, I had\ngot over any such taste as I might once have had for ornamented and\nredundant composition, and come to prefer what was plain and homely.\nAt the same time I had adopted a set of principles on the subject of\nincident, &c., such as would be generally approved in theory, but the\nresult of which, when carried out into practice, often procures for an\nauthor more surprise than pleasure.\n\nI said to myself that my hero should work his way through life as I had\nseen real living men work theirs--that he should never get a shilling\nhe had not earned--that no sudden turns should lift him in a moment to\nwealth and high station; that whatever small competency he might gain,\nshould be won by the sweat of his brow; that, before he could find so\nmuch as an arbour to sit down in, he should master at least half the\nascent of \"the Hill of Difficulty;\" that he should not even marry a\nbeautiful girl or a lady of rank. As Adam's son he should share Adam's\ndoom, and drain throughout life a mixed and moderate cup of enjoyment.\n\nIn the sequel, however, I find that publishers in general scarcely\napproved of this system, but would have liked something more imaginative\nand poetical--something more consonant with a highly wrought fancy, with\na taste for pathos, with sentiments more tender, elevated, unworldly.\nIndeed, until an author has tried to dispose of a manuscript of this\nkind, he can never know what stores of romance and sensibility lie\nhidden in breasts he would not have suspected of casketing such\ntreasures. Men in business are usually thought to prefer the real; on\ntrial the idea will be often found fallacious: a passionate preference\nfor the wild, wonderful, and thrilling--the strange, startling, and\nharrowing--agitates divers souls that show a calm and sober surface.\n\nSuch being the case, the reader will comprehend that to have reached\nhim in the form of a printed book, this brief narrative must have gone\nthrough some struggles--which indeed it has. And after all, its\nworst struggle and strongest ordeal is yet to come but it takes\ncomfort--subdues fear--leans on the staff of a moderate expectation--and\nmutters under its breath, while lifting its eye to that of the public,\n\n\"He that is low need fear no fall.\"\n\nCURRER BELL.\n\nThe foregoing preface was written by my wife with a view to the\npublication of \"The Professor,\" shortly after the appearance of\n\"Shirley.\" Being dissuaded from her intention, the authoress made some\nuse of the materials in a subsequent work--\"Villette.\" As, however,\nthese two stories are in most respects unlike, it has been represented\nto me that I ought not to withhold \"The Professor\" from the public. I\nhave therefore consented to its publication.\n\nA. B. NICHOLLS\n\nHaworth Parsonage,\n\nSeptember 22nd, 1856.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT H E \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 P R O F E S S O R\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. INTRODUCTORY.\n\nTHE other day, in looking over my papers, I found in my desk the\nfollowing copy of a letter, sent by me a year since to an old school\nacquaintance:--\n\n\"DEAR CHARLES,\n\n\"I think when you and I were at Eton together, we were neither of\nus what could be called popular characters: you were a sarcastic,\nobservant, shrewd, cold-blooded creature; my own portrait I will\nnot attempt to draw, but I cannot recollect that it was a strikingly\nattractive one--can you? What animal magnetism drew thee and me together\nI know not; certainly I never experienced anything of the Pylades and\nOrestes sentiment for you, and I have reason to believe that you, on\nyour part, were equally free from all romantic regard to me. Still,\nout of school hours we walked and talked continually together; when the\ntheme of conversation was our companions or our masters we understood\neach other, and when I recurred to some sentiment of affection, some\nvague love of an excellent or beautiful object, whether in animate or\ninanimate nature, your sardonic coldness did not move me. I felt myself\nsuperior to that check THEN as I do NOW.\n\n\"It is a long time since I wrote to you, and a still longer time since\nI saw you. Chancing to take up a newspaper of your county the other day,\nmy eye fell upon your name. I began to think of old times; to run over\nthe events which have transpired since we separated; and I sat down\nand commenced this letter. What you have been doing I know not; but you\nshall hear, if you choose to listen, how the world has wagged with me.\n\n\"First, after leaving Eton, I had an interview with my maternal uncles,\nLord Tynedale and the Hon. John Seacombe. They asked me if I would enter\nthe Church, and my uncle the nobleman offered me the living of Seacombe,\nwhich is in his gift, if I would; then my other uncle, Mr. Seacombe,\nhinted that when I became rector of Seacombe-cum-Scaife, I might perhaps\nbe allowed to take, as mistress of my house and head of my parish, one\nof my six cousins, his daughters, all of whom I greatly dislike.\n\n\"I declined both the Church and matrimony. A good clergyman is a good\nthing, but I should have made a very bad one. As to the wife--oh how\nlike a night-mare is the thought of being bound for life to one of\nmy cousins! No doubt they are accomplished and pretty; but not an\naccomplishment, not a charm of theirs, touches a chord in my bosom.\nTo think of passing the winter evenings by the parlour fire-side of\nSeacombe Rectory alone with one of them--for instance, the large and\nwell-modelled statue, Sarah--no; I should be a bad husband, under such\ncircumstances, as well as a bad clergyman.\n\n\"When I had declined my uncles' offers they asked me 'what I intended\nto do?' I said I should reflect. They reminded me that I had no fortune,\nand no expectation of any, and, after a considerable pause, Lord\nTynedale demanded sternly, 'Whether I had thoughts of following my\nfather's steps and engaging in trade?' Now, I had had no thoughts of the\nsort. I do not think that my turn of mind qualifies me to make a good\ntradesman; my taste, my ambition does not lie in that way; but such was\nthe scorn expressed in Lord Tynedale's countenance as he pronounced\nthe word TRADE--such the contemptuous sarcasm of his tone--that I was\ninstantly decided. My father was but a name to me, yet that name I did\nnot like to hear mentioned with a sneer to my very face. I answered\nthen, with haste and warmth, 'I cannot do better than follow in\nmy father's steps; yes, I will be a tradesman.' My uncles did not\nremonstrate; they and I parted with mutual disgust. In reviewing this\ntransaction, I find that I was quite right to shake off the burden of\nTynedale's patronage, but a fool to offer my shoulders instantly for the\nreception of another burden--one which might be more intolerable, and\nwhich certainly was yet untried.\n\n\"I wrote instantly to Edward--you know Edward--my only brother, ten\nyears my senior, married to a rich mill-owner's daughter, and now\npossessor of the mill and business which was my father's before he\nfailed. You are aware that my father--once reckoned a Croesus of\nwealth--became bankrupt a short time previous to his death, and that my\nmother lived in destitution for some six months after him, unhelped by\nher aristocratical brothers, whom she had mortally offended by her union\nwith Crimsworth, the----shire manufacturer. At the end of the six months\nshe brought me into the world, and then herself left it without, I\nshould think, much regret, as it contained little hope or comfort for\nher.\n\n\"My father's relations took charge of Edward, as they did of me, till I\nwas nine years old. At that period it chanced that the representation of\nan important borough in our county fell vacant; Mr. Seacombe stood for\nit. My uncle Crimsworth, an astute mercantile man, took the opportunity\nof writing a fierce letter to the candidate, stating that if he and Lord\nTynedale did not consent to do something towards the support of their\nsister's orphan children, he would expose their relentless and malignant\nconduct towards that sister, and do his best to turn the circumstances\nagainst Mr. Seacombe's election. That gentleman and Lord T. knew well\nenough that the Crimsworths were an unscrupulous and determined race;\nthey knew also that they had influence in the borough of X----; and,\nmaking a virtue of necessity, they consented to defray the expenses of\nmy education. I was sent to Eton, where I remained ten years, during\nwhich space of time Edward and I never met. He, when he grew up, entered\ninto trade, and pursued his calling with such diligence, ability, and\nsuccess, that now, in his thirtieth year, he was fast making a fortune.\nOf this I was apprised by the occasional short letters I received from\nhim, some three or four times a year; which said letters never concluded\nwithout some expression of determined enmity against the house of\nSeacombe, and some reproach to me for living, as he said, on the bounty\nof that house. At first, while still in boyhood, I could not understand\nwhy, as I had no parents, I should not be indebted to my uncles Tynedale\nand Seacombe for my education; but as I grew up, and heard by degrees of\nthe persevering hostility, the hatred till death evinced by them against\nmy father--of the sufferings of my mother--of all the wrongs, in short,\nof our house--then did I conceive shame of the dependence in which I\nlived, and form a resolution no more to take bread from hands which had\nrefused to minister to the necessities of my dying mother. It was by\nthese feelings I was influenced when I refused the Rectory of Seacombe,\nand the union with one of my patrician cousins.\n\n\"An irreparable breach thus being effected between my uncles and myself,\nI wrote to Edward; told him what had occurred, and informed him of my\nintention to follow his steps and be a tradesman. I asked, moreover, if\nhe could give me employment. His answer expressed no approbation of my\nconduct, but he said I might come down to ----shire, if I liked, and he\nwould 'see what could be done in the way of furnishing me with work.'\nI repressed all--even mental comment on his note--packed my trunk and\ncarpet-bag, and started for the North directly.\n\n\"After two days' travelling (railroads were not then in existence) I\narrived, one wet October afternoon, in the town of X----. I had always\nunderstood that Edward lived in this town, but on inquiry I found that\nit was only Mr. Crimsworth's mill and warehouse which were situated in\nthe smoky atmosphere of Bigben Close; his RESIDENCE lay four miles out,\nin the country.\n\n\"It was late in the evening when I alighted at the gates of the\nhabitation designated to me as my brother's. As I advanced up the\navenue, I could see through the shades of twilight, and the dark gloomy\nmists which deepened those shades, that the house was large, and the\ngrounds surrounding it sufficiently spacious. I paused a moment on the\nlawn in front, and leaning my back against a tall tree which rose in the\ncentre, I gazed with interest on the exterior of Crimsworth Hall.\n\n\"Edward is rich,\" thought I to myself. 'I believed him to be doing\nwell--but I did not know he was master of a mansion like this.' Cutting\nshort all marvelling; speculation, conjecture, &c., I advanced to the\nfront door and rang. A man-servant opened it--I announced myself--he\nrelieved me of my wet cloak and carpet-bag, and ushered me into a\nroom furnished as a library, where there was a bright fire and candles\nburning on the table; he informed me that his master was not yet\nreturned from X----market, but that he would certainly be at home in the\ncourse of half an hour.\n\n\"Being left to myself, I took the stuffed easy chair, covered with red\nmorocco, which stood by the fireside, and while my eyes watched the\nflames dart from the glowing coals, and the cinders fall at intervals on\nthe hearth, my mind busied itself in conjectures concerning the meeting\nabout to take place. Amidst much that was doubtful in the subject of\nthese conjectures, there was one thing tolerably certain--I was in no\ndanger of encountering severe disappointment; from this, the moderation\nof my expectations guaranteed me. I anticipated no overflowings of\nfraternal tenderness; Edward's letters had always been such as to\nprevent the engendering or harbouring of delusions of this sort. Still,\nas I sat awaiting his arrival, I felt eager--very eager--I cannot tell\nyou why; my hand, so utterly a stranger to the grasp of a kindred hand,\nclenched itself to repress the tremor with which impatience would fain\nhave shaken it.\n\n\"I thought of my uncles; and as I was engaged in wondering whether\nEdward's indifference would equal the cold disdain I had always\nexperienced from them, I heard the avenue gates open: wheels approached\nthe house; Mr. Crimsworth was arrived; and after the lapse of some\nminutes, and a brief dialogue between himself and his servant in the\nhall, his tread drew near the library door--that tread alone announced\nthe master of the house.\n\n\"I still retained some confused recollection of Edward as he was ten\nyears ago--a tall, wiry, raw youth; NOW, as I rose from my seat and\nturned towards the library door, I saw a fine-looking and powerful man,\nlight-complexioned, well-made, and of athletic proportions; the first\nglance made me aware of an air of promptitude and sharpness, shown\nas well in his movements as in his port, his eye, and the general\nexpression of his face. He greeted me with brevity, and, in the moment\nof shaking hands, scanned me from head to foot; he took his seat in the\nmorocco covered arm-chair, and motioned me to another seat.\n\n\"'I expected you would have called at the counting-house in the Close,'\nsaid he; and his voice, I noticed, had an abrupt accent, probably\nhabitual to him; he spoke also with a guttural northern tone, which\nsounded harsh in my ears, accustomed to the silvery utterance of the\nSouth.\n\n\"'The landlord of the inn, where the coach stopped, directed me here,'\nsaid I. 'I doubted at first the accuracy of his information, not being\naware that you had such a residence as this.'\n\n\"'Oh, it is all right!' he replied, 'only I was kept half an hour behind\ntime, waiting for you--that is all. I thought you must be coming by the\neight o'clock coach.'\n\n\"I expressed regret that he had had to wait; he made no answer, but\nstirred the fire, as if to cover a movement of impatience; then he\nscanned me again.\n\n\"I felt an inward satisfaction that I had not, in the first moment of\nmeeting, betrayed any warmth, any enthusiasm; that I had saluted this\nman with a quiet and steady phlegm.\n\n\"'Have you quite broken with Tynedale and Seacombe?' he asked hastily.\n\n\"'I do not think I shall have any further communication with them; my\nrefusal of their proposals will, I fancy, operate as a barrier against\nall future intercourse.'\n\n\"'Why,' said he, 'I may as well remind you at the very outset of our\nconnection, that \"no man can serve two masters.\" Acquaintance with Lord\nTynedale will be incompatible with assistance from me.' There was a kind\nof gratuitous menace in his eye as he looked at me in finishing this\nobservation.\n\n\"Feeling no disposition to reply to him, I contented myself with an\ninward speculation on the differences which exist in the constitution\nof men's minds. I do not know what inference Mr. Crimsworth drew from\nmy silence--whether he considered it a symptom of contumacity or an\nevidence of my being cowed by his peremptory manner. After a long and\nhard stare at me, he rose sharply from his seat.\n\n\"'To-morrow,' said he, 'I shall call your attention to some other\npoints; but now it is supper time, and Mrs. Crimsworth is probably\nwaiting; will you come?'\n\n\"He strode from the room, and I followed. In crossing the hall, I\nwondered what Mrs. Crimsworth might be. 'Is she,' thought I, 'as alien\nto what I like as Tynedale, Seacombe, the Misses Seacombe--as the\naffectionate relative now striding before me? or is she better than\nthese? Shall I, in conversing with her, feel free to show something of\nmy real nature; or--' Further conjectures were arrested by my entrance\ninto the dining-room.\n\n\"A lamp, burning under a shade of ground-glass, showed a handsome\napartment, wainscoted with oak; supper was laid on the table; by the\nfire-place, standing as if waiting our entrance, appeared a lady;\nshe was young, tall, and well shaped; her dress was handsome and\nfashionable: so much my first glance sufficed to ascertain. A gay\nsalutation passed between her and Mr. Crimsworth; she chid him, half\nplayfully, half poutingly, for being late; her voice (I always take\nvoices into the account in judging of character) was lively--it\nindicated, I thought, good animal spirits. Mr. Crimsworth soon checked\nher animated scolding with a kiss--a kiss that still told of the\nbridegroom (they had not yet been married a year); she took her seat\nat the supper-table in first-rate spirits. Perceiving me, she begged\nmy pardon for not noticing me before, and then shook hands with me, as\nladies do when a flow of good-humour disposes them to be cheerful to\nall, even the most indifferent of their acquaintance. It was now further\nobvious to me that she had a good complexion, and features sufficiently\nmarked but agreeable; her hair was red--quite red. She and Edward\ntalked much, always in a vein of playful contention; she was vexed, or\npretended to be vexed, that he had that day driven a vicious horse in\nthe gig, and he made light of her fears. Sometimes she appealed to me.\n\n\"'Now, Mr. William, isn't it absurd in Edward to talk so? He says he\nwill drive Jack, and no other horse, and the brute has thrown him twice\nalready.\n\n\"She spoke with a kind of lisp, not disagreeable, but childish. I\nsoon saw also that there was more than girlish--a somewhat infantine\nexpression in her by no means small features; this lisp and expression\nwere, I have no doubt, a charm in Edward's eyes, and would be so to\nthose of most men, but they were not to mine. I sought her eye, desirous\nto read there the intelligence which I could not discern in her face\nor hear in her conversation; it was merry, rather small; by turns I saw\nvivacity, vanity, coquetry, look out through its irid, but I watched in\nvain for a glimpse of soul. I am no Oriental; white necks, carmine lips\nand cheeks, clusters of bright curls, do not suffice for me without that\nPromethean spark which will live after the roses and lilies are faded,\nthe burnished hair grown grey. In sunshine, in prosperity, the flowers\nare very well; but how many wet days are there in life--November seasons\nof disaster, when a man's hearth and home would be cold indeed, without\nthe clear, cheering gleam of intellect.\n\n\"Having perused the fair page of Mrs. Crimsworth's face, a deep,\ninvoluntary sigh announced my disappointment; she took it as a homage to\nher beauty, and Edward, who was evidently proud of his rich and handsome\nyoung wife, threw on me a glance--half ridicule, half ire.\n\n\"I turned from them both, and gazing wearily round the room, I saw two\npictures set in the oak panelling--one on each side the mantel-piece.\nCeasing to take part in the bantering conversation that flowed on\nbetween Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth, I bent my thoughts to the examination\nof these pictures. They were portraits--a lady and a gentleman, both\ncostumed in the fashion of twenty years ago. The gentleman was in the\nshade. I could not see him well. The lady had the benefit of a full beam\nfrom the softly shaded lamp. I presently recognised her; I had seen this\npicture before in childhood; it was my mother; that and the companion\npicture being the only heir-looms saved out of the sale of my father's\nproperty.\n\n\"The face, I remembered, had pleased me as a boy, but then I did not\nunderstand it; now I knew how rare that class of face is in the world,\nand I appreciated keenly its thoughtful, yet gentle expression. The\nserious grey eye possessed for me a strong charm, as did certain lines\nin the features indicative of most true and tender feeling. I was sorry\nit was only a picture.\n\n\"I soon left Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth to themselves; a servant\nconducted me to my bed-room; in closing my chamber-door, I shut out all\nintruders--you, Charles, as well as the rest.\n\n\"Good-bye for the present,\n\n\"WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH.\"\n\nTo this letter I never got an answer; before my old friend received it,\nhe had accepted a Government appointment in one of the colonies, and was\nalready on his way to the scene of his official labours. What has become\nof him since, I know not.\n\nThe leisure time I have at command, and which I intended to employ\nfor his private benefit, I shall now dedicate to that of the public at\nlarge. My narrative is not exciting, and above all, not marvellous;\nbut it may interest some individuals, who, having toiled in the same\nvocation as myself, will find in my experience frequent reflections\nof their own. The above letter will serve as an introduction. I now\nproceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nA FINE October morning succeeded to the foggy evening that had witnessed\nmy first introduction to Crimsworth Hall. I was early up and walking in\nthe large park-like meadow surrounding the house. The autumn sun, rising\nover the ----shire hills, disclosed a pleasant country; woods brown and\nmellow varied the fields from which the harvest had been lately carried;\na river, gliding between the woods, caught on its surface the somewhat\ncold gleam of the October sun and sky; at frequent intervals along the\nbanks of the river, tall, cylindrical chimneys, almost like slender\nround towers, indicated the factories which the trees half concealed;\nhere and there mansions, similar to Crimsworth Hall, occupied agreeable\nsites on the hill-side; the country wore, on the whole, a cheerful,\nactive, fertile look. Steam, trade, machinery had long banished from\nit all romance and seclusion. At a distance of five miles, a valley,\nopening between the low hills, held in its cups the great town of X----.\nA dense, permanent vapour brooded over this locality--there lay Edward's\n\"Concern.\"\n\nI forced my eye to scrutinize this prospect, I forced my mind to dwell\non it for a time, and when I found that it communicated no pleasurable\nemotion to my heart--that it stirred in me none of the hopes a man ought\nto feel, when he sees laid before him the scene of his life's career--I\nsaid to myself, \"William, you are a rebel against circumstances; you are\na fool, and know not what you want; you have chosen trade and you shall\nbe a tradesman. Look!\" I continued mentally--\"Look at the sooty smoke in\nthat hollow, and know that there is your post! There you cannot dream,\nyou cannot speculate and theorize--there you shall out and work!\"\n\nThus self-schooled, I returned to the house. My brother was in the\nbreakfast-room. I met him collectedly--I could not meet him cheerfully;\nhe was standing on the rug, his back to the fire--how much did I read in\nthe expression of his eye as my glance encountered his, when I advanced\nto bid him good morning; how much that was contradictory to my nature!\nHe said \"Good morning\" abruptly and nodded, and then he snatched, rather\nthan took, a newspaper from the table, and began to read it with the air\nof a master who seizes a pretext to escape the bore of conversing with\nan underling. It was well I had taken a resolution to endure for a time,\nor his manner would have gone far to render insupportable the disgust\nI had just been endeavouring to subdue. I looked at him: I measured his\nrobust frame and powerful proportions; I saw my own reflection in the\nmirror over the mantel-piece; I amused myself with comparing the two\npictures. In face I resembled him, though I was not so handsome; my\nfeatures were less regular; I had a darker eye, and a broader brow--in\nform I was greatly inferior--thinner, slighter, not so tall. As an\nanimal, Edward excelled me far; should he prove as paramount in mind\nas in person I must be a slave--for I must expect from him no lion-like\ngenerosity to one weaker than himself; his cold, avaricious eye, his\nstern, forbidding manner told me he would not spare. Had I then force of\nmind to cope with him? I did not know; I had never been tried.\n\nMrs. Crimsworth's entrance diverted my thoughts for a moment. She looked\nwell, dressed in white, her face and her attire shining in morning\nand bridal freshness. I addressed her with the degree of ease her last\nnight's careless gaiety seemed to warrant, but she replied with coolness\nand restraint: her husband had tutored her; she was not to be too\nfamiliar with his clerk.\n\nAs soon as breakfast was over Mr. Crimsworth intimated to me that they\nwere bringing the gig round to the door, and that in five minutes he\nshould expect me to be ready to go down with him to X----. I did not\nkeep him waiting; we were soon dashing at a rapid rate along the\nroad. The horse he drove was the same vicious animal about which Mrs.\nCrimsworth had expressed her fears the night before. Once or twice\nJack seemed disposed to turn restive, but a vigorous and determined\napplication of the whip from the ruthless hand of his master soon\ncompelled him to submission, and Edward's dilated nostril expressed his\ntriumph in the result of the contest; he scarcely spoke to me during the\nwhole of the brief drive, only opening his lips at intervals to damn his\nhorse.\n\nX---- was all stir and bustle when we entered it; we left the clean\nstreets where there were dwelling-houses and shops, churches, and public\nbuildings; we left all these, and turned down to a region of mills and\nwarehouses; thence we passed through two massive gates into a great\npaved yard, and we were in Bigben Close, and the mill was before us,\nvomiting soot from its long chimney, and quivering through its thick\nbrick walls with the commotion of its iron bowels. Workpeople were\npassing to and fro; a waggon was being laden with pieces. Mr. Crimsworth\nlooked from side to side, and seemed at one glance to comprehend all\nthat was going on; he alighted, and leaving his horse and gig to the\ncare of a man who hastened to take the reins from his hand, he bid me\nfollow him to the counting-house. We entered it; a very different place\nfrom the parlours of Crimsworth Hall--a place for business, with a bare,\nplanked floor, a safe, two high desks and stools, and some chairs. A\nperson was seated at one of the desks, who took off his square cap when\nMr. Crimsworth entered, and in an instant was again absorbed in his\noccupation of writing or calculating--I know not which.\n\nMr. Crimsworth, having removed his mackintosh, sat down by the fire. I\nremained standing near the hearth; he said presently--\n\n\"Steighton, you may leave the room; I have some business to transact\nwith this gentleman. Come back when you hear the bell.\"\n\nThe individual at the desk rose and departed, closing the door as he\nwent out. Mr. Crimsworth stirred the fire, then folded his arms, and sat\na moment thinking, his lips compressed, his brow knit. I had nothing to\ndo but to watch him--how well his features were cut! what a handsome man\nhe was! Whence, then, came that air of contraction--that narrow and hard\naspect on his forehead, in all his lineaments?\n\nTurning to me he began abruptly:\n\n\"You are come down to ----shire to learn to be a tradesman?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Have you made up your mind on the point? Let me know that at once.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I am not bound to help you, but I have a place here vacant, if\nyou are qualified for it. I will take you on trial. What can you do? Do\nyou know anything besides that useless trash of college learning--Greek,\nLatin, and so forth?\"\n\n\"I have studied mathematics.\"\n\n\"Stuff! I dare say you have.\"\n\n\"I can read and write French and German.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" He reflected a moment, then opening a drawer in a desk near him\ntook out a letter, and gave it to me.\n\n\"Can you read that?\" he asked.\n\nIt was a German commercial letter; I translated it; I could not tell\nwhether he was gratified or not--his countenance remained fixed.\n\n\"It is well,\" he said, after a pause, \"that you are acquainted with\nsomething useful, something that may enable you to earn your board and\nlodging: since you know French and German, I will take you as second\nclerk to manage the foreign correspondence of the house. I shall give\nyou a good salary--90l. a year--and now,\" he continued, raising his\nvoice, \"hear once for all what I have to say about our relationship, and\nall that sort of humbug! I must have no nonsense on that point; it\nwould never suit me. I shall excuse you nothing on the plea of being my\nbrother; if I find you stupid, negligent, dissipated, idle, or possessed\nof any faults detrimental to the interests of the house, I shall dismiss\nyou as I would any other clerk. Ninety pounds a year are good wages, and\nI expect to have the full value of my money out of you; remember,\ntoo, that things are on a practical footing in my\nestablishment--business-like habits, feelings, and ideas, suit me best.\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"Partly,\" I replied. \"I suppose you mean that I am to do my work for my\nwages; not to expect favour from you, and not to depend on you for any\nhelp but what I earn; that suits me exactly, and on these terms I will\nconsent to be your clerk.\"\n\nI turned on my heel, and walked to the window; this time I did not\nconsult his face to learn his opinion: what it was I do not know, nor\ndid I then care. After a silence of some minutes he recommenced:--\n\n\"You perhaps expect to be accommodated with apartments at Crimsworth\nHall, and to go and come with me in the gig. I wish you, however, to be\naware that such an arrangement would be quite inconvenient to me. I\nlike to have the seat in my gig at liberty for any gentleman whom for\nbusiness reasons I may wish to take down to the hall for a night or so.\nYou will seek out lodgings in X----.\"\n\nQuitting the window, I walked back to the hearth.\n\n\"Of course I shall seek out lodgings in X----,\" I answered. \"It would\nnot suit me either to lodge at Crimsworth Hall.\"\n\nMy tone was quiet. I always speak quietly. Yet Mr. Crimsworth's blue eye\nbecame incensed; he took his revenge rather oddly. Turning to me he said\nbluntly--\n\n\"You are poor enough, I suppose; how do you expect to live till your\nquarter's salary becomes due?\"\n\n\"I shall get on,\" said I.\n\n\"How do you expect to live?\" he repeated in a louder voice.\n\n\"As I can, Mr. Crimsworth.\"\n\n\"Get into debt at your peril! that's all,\" he answered. \"For aught I\nknow you may have extravagant aristocratic habits: if you have, drop\nthem; I tolerate nothing of the sort here, and I will never give you a\nshilling extra, whatever liabilities you may incur--mind that.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Crimsworth, you will find I have a good memory.\"\n\nI said no more. I did not think the time was come for much parley. I\nhad an instinctive feeling that it would be folly to let one's temper\neffervesce often with such a man as Edward. I said to myself, \"I will\nplace my cup under this continual dropping; it shall stand there still\nand steady; when full, it will run over of itself--meantime patience.\nTwo things are certain. I am capable of performing the work Mr.\nCrimsworth has set me; I can earn my wages conscientiously, and those\nwages are sufficient to enable me to live. As to the fact of my brother\nassuming towards me the bearing of a proud, harsh master, the fault is\nhis, not mine; and shall his injustice, his bad feeling, turn me at once\naside from the path I have chosen? No; at least, ere I deviate, I will\nadvance far enough to see whither my career tends. As yet I am only\npressing in at the entrance--a strait gate enough; it ought to have a\ngood terminus.\" While I thus reasoned, Mr. Crimsworth rang a bell; his\nfirst clerk, the individual dismissed previously to our conference,\nre-entered.\n\n\"Mr. Steighton,\" said he, \"show Mr. William the letters from Voss,\nBrothers, and give him English copies of the answers; he will translate\nthem.\"\n\nMr. Steighton, a man of about thirty-five, with a face at once sly and\nheavy, hastened to execute this order; he laid the letters on the\ndesk, and I was soon seated at it, and engaged in rendering the English\nanswers into German. A sentiment of keen pleasure accompanied this first\neffort to earn my own living--a sentiment neither poisoned nor weakened\nby the presence of the taskmaster, who stood and watched me for some\ntime as I wrote. I thought he was trying to read my character, but I\nfelt as secure against his scrutiny as if I had had on a casque with the\nvisor down--or rather I showed him my countenance with the confidence\nthat one would show an unlearned man a letter written in Greek; he might\nsee lines, and trace characters, but he could make nothing of them; my\nnature was not his nature, and its signs were to him like the words of\nan unknown tongue. Ere long he turned away abruptly, as if baffled, and\nleft the counting-house; he returned to it but twice in the course of\nthat day; each time he mixed and swallowed a glass of brandy-and-water,\nthe materials for making which he extracted from a cupboard on one side\nof the fireplace; having glanced at my translations--he could read both\nFrench and German--he went out again in silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nI SERVED Edward as his second clerk faithfully, punctually, diligently.\nWhat was given me to do I had the power and the determination to do\nwell. Mr. Crimsworth watched sharply for defects, but found none; he set\nTimothy Steighton, his favourite and head man, to watch also. Tim was\nbaffled; I was as exact as himself, and quicker. Mr. Crimsworth made\ninquiries as to how I lived, whether I got into debt--no, my accounts\nwith my landlady were always straight. I had hired small lodgings, which\nI contrived to pay for out of a slender fund--the accumulated savings of\nmy Eton pocket-money; for as it had ever been abhorrent to my nature to\nask pecuniary assistance, I had early acquired habits of self-denying\neconomy; husbanding my monthly allowance with anxious care, in order to\nobviate the danger of being forced, in some moment of future exigency,\nto beg additional aid. I remember many called me miser at the time,\nand I used to couple the reproach with this consolation--better to be\nmisunderstood now than repulsed hereafter. At this day I had my reward;\nI had had it before, when on parting with my irritated uncles one of\nthem threw down on the table before me a 5l. note, which I was able to\nleave there, saying that my travelling expenses were already provided\nfor. Mr. Crimsworth employed Tim to find out whether my landlady had\nany complaint to make on the score of my morals; she answered that she\nbelieved I was a very religious man, and asked Tim, in her turn, if he\nthought I had any intention of going into the Church some day; for, she\nsaid, she had had young curates to lodge in her house who were nothing\nequal to me for steadiness and quietness. Tim was \"a religious man\"\nhimself; indeed, he was \"a joined Methodist,\" which did not (be it\nunderstood) prevent him from being at the same time an engrained rascal,\nand he came away much posed at hearing this account of my piety. Having\nimparted it to Mr. Crimsworth, that gentleman, who himself frequented\nno place of worship, and owned no God but Mammon, turned the information\ninto a weapon of attack against the equability of my temper. He\ncommenced a series of covert sneers, of which I did not at first\nperceive the drift, till my landlady happened to relate the conversation\nshe had had with Mr. Steighton; this enlightened me; afterwards I came\nto the counting-house prepared, and managed to receive the millowner's\nblasphemous sarcasms, when next levelled at me, on a buckler of\nimpenetrable indifference. Ere long he tired of wasting his ammunition\non a statue, but he did not throw away the shafts--he only kept them\nquiet in his quiver.\n\nOnce during my clerkship I had an invitation to Crimsworth Hall; it\nwas on the occasion of a large party given in honour of the master's\nbirthday; he had always been accustomed to invite his clerks on similar\nanniversaries, and could not well pass me over; I was, however, kept\nstrictly in the background. Mrs. Crimsworth, elegantly dressed in satin\nand lace, blooming in youth and health, vouchsafed me no more notice\nthan was expressed by a distant move; Crimsworth, of course, never\nspoke to me; I was introduced to none of the band of young ladies, who,\nenveloped in silvery clouds of white gauze and muslin, sat in array\nagainst me on the opposite side of a long and large room; in fact, I was\nfairly isolated, and could but contemplate the shining ones from afar,\nand when weary of such a dazzling scene, turn for a change to the\nconsideration of the carpet pattern. Mr. Crimsworth, standing on the\nrug, his elbow supported by the marble mantelpiece, and about him\na group of very pretty girls, with whom he conversed gaily--Mr.\nCrimsworth, thus placed, glanced at me; I looked weary, solitary, kept\ndown like some desolate tutor or governess; he was satisfied.\n\nDancing began; I should have liked well enough to be introduced to some\npleasing and intelligent girl, and to have freedom and opportunity\nto show that I could both feel and communicate the pleasure of social\nintercourse--that I was not, in short, a block, or a piece of furniture,\nbut an acting, thinking, sentient man. Many smiling faces and graceful\nfigures glided past me, but the smiles were lavished on other eyes, the\nfigures sustained by other hands than mine. I turned away tantalized,\nleft the dancers, and wandered into the oak-panelled dining-room. No\nfibre of sympathy united me to any living thing in this house; I looked\nfor and found my mother's picture. I took a wax taper from a stand,\nand held it up. I gazed long, earnestly; my heart grew to the image.\nMy mother, I perceived, had bequeathed to me much of her features and\ncountenance--her forehead, her eyes, her complexion. No regular beauty\npleases egotistical human beings so much as a softened and refined\nlikeness of themselves; for this reason, fathers regard with complacency\nthe lineaments of their daughters' faces, where frequently their own\nsimilitude is found flatteringly associated with softness of hue and\ndelicacy of outline. I was just wondering how that picture, to me so\ninteresting, would strike an impartial spectator, when a voice close\nbehind me pronounced the words--\n\n\"Humph! there's some sense in that face.\"\n\nI turned; at my elbow stood a tall man, young, though probably five or\nsix years older than I--in other respects of an appearance the opposite\nto common place; though just now, as I am not disposed to paint his\nportrait in detail, the reader must be content with the silhouette I\nhave just thrown off; it was all I myself saw of him for the moment: I\ndid not investigate the colour of his eyebrows, nor of his eyes either;\nI saw his stature, and the outline of his shape; I saw, too, his\nfastidious-looking RETROUSSE nose; these observations, few in number,\nand general in character (the last excepted), sufficed, for they enabled\nme to recognize him.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Hunsden,\" muttered I with a bow, and then, like a\nshy noodle as I was, I began moving away--and why? Simply because Mr.\nHunsden was a manufacturer and a millowner, and I was only a clerk, and\nmy instinct propelled me from my superior. I had frequently seen Hunsden\nin Bigben Close, where he came almost weekly to transact business with\nMr. Crimsworth, but I had never spoken to him, nor he to me, and I owed\nhim a sort of involuntary grudge, because he had more than once been the\ntacit witness of insults offered by Edward to me. I had the conviction\nthat he could only regard me as a poor-spirited slave, wherefore I now\nwent about to shun his presence and eschew his conversation.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked he, as I edged off sideways. I had already\nnoticed that Mr. Hunsden indulged in abrupt forms of speech, and I\nperversely said to myself--\n\n\"He thinks he may speak as he likes to a poor clerk; but my mood is not,\nperhaps, so supple as he deems it, and his rough freedom pleases me not\nat all.\"\n\nI made some slight reply, rather indifferent than courteous, and\ncontinued to move away. He coolly planted himself in my path.\n\n\"Stay here awhile,\" said he: \"it is so hot in the dancing-room; besides,\nyou don't dance; you have not had a partner to-night.\"\n\nHe was right, and as he spoke neither his look, tone, nor manner\ndispleased me; my AMOUR-PROPRE was propitiated; he had not addressed\nme out of condescension, but because, having repaired to the cool\ndining-room for refreshment, he now wanted some one to talk to, by way\nof temporary amusement. I hate to be condescended to, but I like well\nenough to oblige; I stayed.\n\n\"That is a good picture,\" he continued, recurring to the portrait.\n\n\"Do you consider the face pretty?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pretty! no--how can it be pretty, with sunk eyes and hollow cheeks?\nbut it is peculiar; it seems to think. You could have a talk with that\nwoman, if she were alive, on other subjects than dress, visiting, and\ncompliments.\"\n\nI agreed with him, but did not say so. He went on.\n\n\"Not that I admire a head of that sort; it wants character and force;\nthere's too much of the sen-si-tive (so he articulated it, curling\nhis lip at the same time) in that mouth; besides, there is Aristocrat\nwritten on the brow and defined in the figure; I hate your aristocrats.\"\n\n\"You think, then, Mr. Hunsden, that patrician descent may be read in a\ndistinctive cast of form and features?\"\n\n\"Patrician descent be hanged! Who doubts that your lordlings may have\ntheir 'distinctive cast of form and features' as much as we----shire\ntradesmen have ours? But which is the best? Not theirs assuredly. As\nto their women, it is a little different: they cultivate beauty from\nchildhood upwards, and may by care and training attain to a certain\ndegree of excellence in that point, just like the oriental odalisques.\nYet even this superiority is doubtful. Compare the figure in that frame\nwith Mrs. Edward Crimsworth--which is the finer animal?\"\n\nI replied quietly: \"Compare yourself and Mr. Edward Crimsworth, Mr\nHunsden.\"\n\n\"Oh, Crimsworth is better filled up than I am, I know besides he has a\nstraight nose, arched eyebrows, and all that; but these advantages--if\nthey are advantages--he did not inherit from his mother, the patrician,\nbut from his father, old Crimsworth, who, MY father says, was as\nveritable a ----shire blue-dyer as ever put indigo in a vat yet withal\nthe handsomest man in the three Ridings. It is you, William, who are\nthe aristocrat of your family, and you are not as fine a fellow as your\nplebeian brother by long chalk.\"\n\nThere was something in Mr. Hunsden's point-blank mode of speech which\nrather pleased me than otherwise because it set me at my ease. I\ncontinued the conversation with a degree of interest.\n\n\"How do you happen to know that I am Mr. Crimsworth's brother? I thought\nyou and everybody else looked upon me only in the light of a poor\nclerk.\"\n\n\"Well, and so we do; and what are you but a poor clerk? You do\nCrimsworth's work, and he gives you wages--shabby wages they are, too.\"\n\nI was silent. Hunsden's language now bordered on the impertinent, still\nhis manner did not offend me in the least--it only piqued my curiosity;\nI wanted him to go on, which he did in a little while.\n\n\"This world is an absurd one,\" said he.\n\n\"Why so, Mr. Hunsden?\"\n\n\"I wonder you should ask: you are yourself a strong proof of the\nabsurdity I allude to.\"\n\nI was determined he should explain himself of his own accord, without my\npressing him so to do--so I resumed my silence.\n\n\"Is it your intention to become a tradesman?\" he inquired presently.\n\n\"It was my serious intention three months ago.\"\n\n\"Humph! the more fool you--you look like a tradesman! What a practical\nbusiness-like face you have!\"\n\n\"My face is as the Lord made it, Mr. Hunsden.\"\n\n\"The Lord never made either your face or head for X---- What good can\nyour bumps of ideality, comparison, self-esteem, conscientiousness,\ndo you here? But if you like Bigben Close, stay there; it's your own\naffair, not mine.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I have no choice.\"\n\n\"Well, I care nought about it--it will make little difference to me what\nyou do or where you go; but I'm cool now--I want to dance again; and\nI see such a fine girl sitting in the corner of the sofa there by\nher mamma; see if I don't get her for a partner in a jiffy! There's\nWaddy--Sam Waddy making up to her; won't I cut him out?\"\n\nAnd Mr. Hunsden strode away. I watched him through the open\nfolding-doors; he outstripped Waddy, applied for the hand of the\nfine girl, and led her off triumphant. She was a tall, well-made,\nfull-formed, dashingly-dressed young woman, much in the style of Mrs. E.\nCrimsworth; Hunsden whirled her through the waltz with spirit; he kept\nat her side during the remainder of the evening, and I read in her\nanimated and gratified countenance that he succeeded in making himself\nperfectly agreeable. The mamma too (a stout person in a turban--Mrs.\nLupton by name) looked well pleased; prophetic visions probably\nflattered her inward eye. The Hunsdens were of an old stem; and scornful\nas Yorke (such was my late interlocutor's name) professed to be of\nthe advantages of birth, in his secret heart he well knew and fully\nappreciated the distinction his ancient, if not high lineage conferred\non him in a mushroom-place like X----, concerning whose inhabitants\nit was proverbially said, that not one in a thousand knew his own\ngrandfather. Moreover the Hunsdens, once rich, were still independent;\nand report affirmed that Yorke bade fair, by his success in business,\nto restore to pristine prosperity the partially decayed fortunes of his\nhouse. These circumstances considered, Mrs. Lupton's broad face might\nwell wear a smile of complacency as she contemplated the heir of Hunsden\nWood occupied in paying assiduous court to her darling Sarah Martha. I,\nhowever, whose observations being less anxious, were likely to be more\naccurate, soon saw that the grounds for maternal self-congratulation\nwere slight indeed; the gentleman appeared to me much more desirous of\nmaking, than susceptible of receiving an impression. I know not what it\nwas in Mr. Hunsden that, as I watched him (I had nothing better to do),\nsuggested to me, every now and then, the idea of a foreigner. In form\nand features he might be pronounced English, though even there one\ncaught a dash of something Gallic; but he had no English shyness: he had\nlearnt somewhere, somehow, the art of setting himself quite at his ease,\nand of allowing no insular timidity to intervene as a barrier between\nhim and his convenience or pleasure. Refinement he did not affect, yet\nvulgar he could not be called; he was not odd--no quiz--yet he resembled\nno one else I had ever seen before; his general bearing intimated\ncomplete, sovereign satisfaction with himself; yet, at times, an\nindescribable shade passed like an eclipse over his countenance, and\nseemed to me like the sign of a sudden and strong inward doubt of\nhimself, his words and actions an energetic discontent at his life or\nhis social position, his future prospects or his mental attainments--I\nknow not which; perhaps after all it might only be a bilious caprice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nNo man likes to acknowledge that he has made a mistake in the choice of\nhis profession, and every man, worthy of the name, will row long against\nwind and tide before he allows himself to cry out, \"I am baffled!\" and\nsubmits to be floated passively back to land. From the first week of my\nresidence in X---- I felt my occupation irksome. The thing itself--the\nwork of copying and translating business-letters--was a dry and tedious\ntask enough, but had that been all, I should long have borne with the\nnuisance; I am not of an impatient nature, and influenced by the double\ndesire of getting my living and justifying to myself and others the\nresolution I had taken to become a tradesman, I should have endured\nin silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties; I should not have\nwhispered, even inwardly, that I longed for liberty; I should have pent\nin every sigh by which my heart might have ventured to intimate its\ndistress under the closeness, smoke, monotony and joyless tumult of\nBigben Close, and its panting desire for freer and fresher scenes; I\nshould have set up the image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my\nsmall bedroom at Mrs. King's lodgings, and they two should have been\nmy household gods, from which my darling, my cherished-in-secret,\nImagination, the tender and the mighty, should never, either by softness\nor strength, have severed me. But this was not all; the antipathy which\nhad sprung up between myself and my employer striking deeper root and\nspreading denser shade daily, excluded me from every glimpse of the\nsunshine of life; and I began to feel like a plant growing in humid\ndarkness out of the slimy walls of a well.\n\nAntipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward\nCrimsworth had for me--a feeling, in a great measure, involuntary, and\nwhich was liable to be excited by every, the most trifling movement,\nlook, or word of mine. My southern accent annoyed him; the degree\nof education evinced in my language irritated him; my punctuality,\nindustry, and accuracy, fixed his dislike, and gave it the high flavour\nand poignant relish of envy; he feared that I too should one day make a\nsuccessful tradesman. Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would\nnot have hated me so thoroughly, but I knew all that he knew, and, what\nwas worse, he suspected that I kept the padlock of silence on mental\nwealth in which he was no sharer. If he could have once placed me in a\nridiculous or mortifying position, he would have forgiven me much, but I\nwas guarded by three faculties--Caution, Tact, Observation; and\nprowling and prying as was Edward's malignity, it could never baffle\nthe lynx-eyes of these, my natural sentinels. Day by day did his malice\nwatch my tact, hoping it would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like\non its slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps.\n\nI had received my first quarter's wages, and was returning to my\nlodgings, possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that\nthe master who had paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned\npittance--(I had long ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother--he\nwas a hard, grinding master; he wished to be an inexorable tyrant: that\nwas all). Thoughts, not varied but strong, occupied my mind; two voices\nspoke within me; again and again they uttered the same monotonous\nphrases. One said: \"William, your life is intolerable.\" The other: \"What\ncan you do to alter it?\" I walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night\nin January; as I approached my lodgings, I turned from a general view of\nmy affairs to the particular speculation as to whether my fire would be\nout; looking towards the window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering\nred gleam.\n\n\"That slut of a servant has neglected it as usual,\" said I, \"and I shall\nsee nothing but pale ashes if I go in; it is a fine starlight night--I\nwill walk a little farther.\"\n\nIt WAS a fine night, and the streets were dry and even clean for X----;\nthere was a crescent curve of moonlight to be seen by the parish church\ntower, and hundreds of stars shone keenly bright in all quarters of the\nsky.\n\nUnconsciously I steered my course towards the country; I had got into\nGrove-street, and began to feel the pleasure of seeing dim trees at the\nextremity, round a suburban house, when a person leaning over the iron\ngate of one of the small gardens which front the neat dwelling-houses in\nthis street, addressed me as I was hurrying with quick stride past.\n\n\"What the deuce is the hurry? Just so must Lot have left Sodom, when he\nexpected fire to pour down upon it, out of burning brass clouds.\"\n\nI stopped short, and looked towards the speaker. I smelt the fragrance,\nand saw the red spark of a cigar; the dusk outline of a man, too, bent\ntowards me over the wicket.\n\n\"You see I am meditating in the field at eventide,\" continued this\nshade. \"God knows it's cool work! especially as instead of Rebecca on\na camel's hump, with bracelets on her arms and a ring in her nose, Fate\nsends me only a counting-house clerk, in a grey tweed wrapper.\" The\nvoice was familiar to me--its second utterance enabled me to seize the\nspeaker's identity.\n\n\"Mr. Hunsden! good evening.\"\n\n\"Good evening, indeed! yes, but you would have passed me without\nrecognition if I had not been so civil as to speak first.\"\n\n\"I did not know you.\"\n\n\"A famous excuse! You ought to have known me; I knew you, though you\nwere going ahead like a steam-engine. Are the police after you?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't be worth their while; I'm not of consequence enough to\nattract them.\"\n\n\"Alas, poor shepherd! Alack and well-a-day! What a theme for regret, and\nhow down in the mouth you must be, judging from the sound of your voice!\nBut since you're not running from the police, from whom are you running?\nthe devil?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am going post to him.\"\n\n\"That is well--you're just in luck: this is Tuesday evening; there are\nscores of market gigs and carts returning to Dinneford to-night; and he,\nor some of his, have a seat in all regularly; so, if you'll step in\nand sit half-an-hour in my bachelor's parlour, you may catch him as he\npasses without much trouble. I think though you'd better let him alone\nto-night, he'll have so many customers to serve; Tuesday is his busy day\nin X---- and Dinneford; come in at all events.\"\n\nHe swung the wicket open as he spoke.\n\n\"Do you really wish me to go in?\" I asked.\n\n\"As you please--I'm alone; your company for an hour or two would be\nagreeable to me; but, if you don't choose to favour me so far, I'll not\npress the point. I hate to bore any one.\"\n\nIt suited me to accept the invitation as it suited Hunsden to give it.\nI passed through the gate, and followed him to the front door, which he\nopened; thence we traversed a passage, and entered his parlour; the door\nbeing shut, he pointed me to an arm-chair by the hearth; I sat down, and\nglanced round me.\n\nIt was a comfortable room, at once snug and handsome; the bright grate\nwas filled with a genuine ----shire fire, red, clear, and generous, no\npenurious South-of-England embers heaped in the corner of a grate. On\nthe table a shaded lamp diffused around a soft, pleasant, and equal\nlight; the furniture was almost luxurious for a young bachelor,\ncomprising a couch and two very easy chairs; bookshelves filled the\nrecesses on each side of the mantelpiece; they were well-furnished, and\narranged with perfect order. The neatness of the room suited my taste;\nI hate irregular and slovenly habits. From what I saw I concluded that\nHunsden's ideas on that point corresponded with my own. While he removed\nfrom the centre-table to the side-board a few pamphlets and periodicals,\nI ran my eye along the shelves of the book-case nearest me. French and\nGerman works predominated, the old French dramatists, sundry modern\nauthors, Thiers, Villemain, Paul de Kock, George Sand, Eugene Sue; in\nGerman--Goethe, Schiller, Zschokke, Jean Paul Richter; in English there\nwere works on Political Economy. I examined no further, for Mr. Hunsden\nhimself recalled my attention.\n\n\"You shall have something,\" said he, \"for you ought to feel disposed for\nrefreshment after walking nobody knows how far on such a Canadian night\nas this; but it shall not be brandy-and-water, and it shall not be\na bottle of port, nor ditto of sherry. I keep no such poison. I have\nRhein-wein for my own drinking, and you may choose between that and\ncoffee.\"\n\nHere again Hunsden suited me: if there was one generally received\npractice I abhorred more than another, it was the habitual imbibing of\nspirits and strong wines. I had, however, no fancy for his acid German\nnectar, but I liked coffee, so I responded--\n\n\"Give me some coffee, Mr. Hunsden.\"\n\nI perceived my answer pleased him; he had doubtless expected to see a\nchilling effect produced by his steady announcement that he would give\nme neither wine nor spirits; he just shot one searching glance at my\nface to ascertain whether my cordiality was genuine or a mere feint\nof politeness. I smiled, because I quite understood him; and, while I\nhonoured his conscientious firmness, I was amused at his mistrust; he\nseemed satisfied, rang the bell, and ordered coffee, which was presently\nbrought; for himself, a bunch of grapes and half a pint of something\nsour sufficed. My coffee was excellent; I told him so, and expressed the\nshuddering pity with which his anchorite fare inspired me. He did not\nanswer, and I scarcely think heard my remark. At that moment one of\nthose momentary eclipses I before alluded to had come over his face,\nextinguishing his smile, and replacing, by an abstracted and alienated\nlook, the customarily shrewd, bantering glance of his eye. I employed\nthe interval of silence in a rapid scrutiny of his physiognomy. I had\nnever observed him closely before; and, as my sight is very short, I had\ngathered only a vague, general idea of his appearance; I was surprised\nnow, on examination, to perceive how small, and even feminine, were his\nlineaments; his tall figure, long and dark locks, his voice and general\nbearing, had impressed me with the notion of something powerful and\nmassive; not at all:--my own features were cast in a harsher and squarer\nmould than his. I discerned that there would be contrasts between his\ninward and outward man; contentions, too; for I suspected his soul\nhad more of will and ambition than his body had of fibre and muscle.\nPerhaps, in these incompatibilities of the \"physique\" with the \"morale,\"\nlay the secret of that fitful gloom; he WOULD but COULD not, and the\nathletic mind scowled scorn on its more fragile companion. As to his\ngood looks, I should have liked to have a woman's opinion on that\nsubject; it seemed to me that his face might produce the same effect\non a lady that a very piquant and interesting, though scarcely pretty,\nfemale face would on a man. I have mentioned his dark locks--they were\nbrushed sideways above a white and sufficiently expansive forehead; his\ncheek had a rather hectic freshness; his features might have done well\non canvas, but indifferently in marble: they were plastic; character\nhad set a stamp upon each; expression re-cast them at her pleasure, and\nstrange metamorphoses she wrought, giving him now the mien of a morose\nbull, and anon that of an arch and mischievous girl; more frequently,\nthe two semblances were blent, and a queer, composite countenance they\nmade.\n\nStarting from his silent fit, he began:--\n\n\"William! what a fool you are to live in those dismal lodgings of Mrs.\nKing's, when you might take rooms here in Grove Street, and have a\ngarden like me!\"\n\n\"I should be too far from the mill.\"\n\n\"What of that? It would do you good to walk there and back two or three\ntimes a day; besides, are you such a fossil that you never wish to see a\nflower or a green leaf?\"\n\n\"I am no fossil.\"\n\n\"What are you then? You sit at that desk in Crimsworth's counting-house\nday by day and week by week, scraping with a pen on paper, just like an\nautomaton; you never get up; you never say you are tired; you never ask\nfor a holiday; you never take change or relaxation; you give way to\nno excess of an evening; you neither keep wild company, nor indulge in\nstrong drink.\"\n\n\"Do you, Mr. Hunsden?\"\n\n\"Don't think to pose me with short questions; your case and mine\nare diametrically different, and it is nonsense attempting to draw a\nparallel. I say, that when a man endures patiently what ought to be\nunendurable, he is a fossil.\"\n\n\"Whence do you acquire the knowledge of my patience?\"\n\n\"Why, man, do you suppose you are a mystery? The other night you seemed\nsurprised at my knowing to what family you belonged; now you find\nsubject for wonderment in my calling you patient. What do you think I do\nwith my eyes and ears? I've been in your counting-house more than once\nwhen Crimsworth has treated you like a dog; called for a book, for\ninstance, and when you gave him the wrong one, or what he chose to\nconsider the wrong one, flung it back almost in your face; desired you\nto shut or open the door as if you had been his flunkey; to say nothing\nof your position at the party about a month ago, where you had neither\nplace nor partner, but hovered about like a poor, shabby hanger-on; and\nhow patient you were under each and all of these circumstances!\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Hunsden, what then?\"\n\n\"I can hardly tell you what then; the conclusion to be drawn as to\nyour character depends upon the nature of the motives which guide\nyour conduct; if you are patient because you expect to make something\neventually out of Crimsworth, notwithstanding his tyranny, or perhaps by\nmeans of it, you are what the world calls an interested and mercenary,\nbut may be a very wise fellow; if you are patient because you think it a\nduty to meet insult with submission, you are an essential sap, and in\nno shape the man for my money; if you are patient because your nature is\nphlegmatic, flat, inexcitable, and that you cannot get up to the pitch\nof resistance, why, God made you to be crushed; and lie down by all\nmeans, and lie flat, and let Juggernaut ride well over you.\"\n\nMr. Hunsden's eloquence was not, it will be perceived, of the smooth and\noily order. As he spoke, he pleased me ill. I seem to recognize in him\none of those characters who, sensitive enough themselves, are selfishly\nrelentless towards the sensitiveness of others. Moreover, though he\nwas neither like Crimsworth nor Lord Tynedale, yet he was acrid, and, I\nsuspected, overbearing in his way: there was a tone of despotism in\nthe urgency of the very reproaches by which he aimed at goading the\noppressed into rebellion against the oppressor. Looking at him still\nmore fixedly than I had yet done, I saw written in his eye and mien a\nresolution to arrogate to himself a freedom so unlimited that it might\noften trench on the just liberty of his neighbours. I rapidly ran over\nthese thoughts, and then I laughed a low and involuntary laugh, moved\nthereto by a slight inward revelation of the inconsistency of man.\nIt was as I thought: Hunsden had expected me to take with calm his\nincorrect and offensive surmises, his bitter and haughty taunts; and\nhimself was chafed by a laugh, scarce louder than a whisper.\n\nHis brow darkened, his thin nostril dilated a little.\n\n\"Yes,\" he began, \"I told you that you were an aristocrat, and who but\nan aristocrat would laugh such a laugh as that, and look such a look?\nA laugh frigidly jeering; a look lazily mutinous; gentlemanlike irony,\npatrician resentment. What a nobleman you would have made, William\nCrimsworth! You are cut out for one; pity Fortune has baulked Nature!\nLook at the features, figure, even to the hands--distinction all\nover--ugly distinction! Now, if you'd only an estate and a mansion,\nand a park, and a title, how you could play the exclusive, maintain the\nrights of your class, train your tenantry in habits of respect to the\npeerage, oppose at every step the advancing power of the people, support\nyour rotten order, and be ready for its sake to wade knee-deep in\nchurls' blood; as it is, you've no power; you can do nothing; you're\nwrecked and stranded on the shores of commerce; forced into collision\nwith practical men, with whom you cannot cope, for YOU'LL NEVER BE A\nTRADESMAN.\"\n\nThe first part of Hunsden's speech moved me not at all, or, if it did,\nit was only to wonder at the perversion into which prejudice had twisted\nhis judgment of my character; the concluding sentence, however, not only\nmoved, but shook me; the blow it gave was a severe one, because Truth\nwielded the weapon. If I smiled now, it, was only in disdain of myself.\n\nHunsden saw his advantage; he followed it up.\n\n\"You'll make nothing by trade,\" continued he; \"nothing more than the\ncrust of dry bread and the draught of fair water on which you now live;\nyour only chance of getting a competency lies in marrying a rich widow,\nor running away with an heiress.\"\n\n\"I leave such shifts to be put in practice by those who devise them,\"\nsaid I, rising.\n\n\"And even that is hopeless,\" he went on coolly. \"What widow would have\nyou? Much less, what heiress? You're not bold and venturesome enough for\nthe one, nor handsome and fascinating enough for the other. You think\nperhaps you look intelligent and polished; carry your intellect and\nrefinement to market, and tell me in a private note what price is bid\nfor them.\"\n\nMr. Hunsden had taken his tone for the night; the string he struck was\nout of tune, he would finger no other. Averse to discord, of which I had\nenough every day and all day long, I concluded, at last, that silence\nand solitude were preferable to jarring converse; I bade him good-night.\n\n\"What! Are you going, lad? Well, good-night: you'll find the door.\" And\nhe sat still in front of the fire, while I left the room and the house.\nI had got a good way on my return to my lodgings before I found out that\nI was walking very fast, and breathing very hard, and that my nails were\nalmost stuck into the palms of my clenched hands, and that my teeth were\nset fast; on making this discovery, I relaxed both my pace, fists, and\njaws, but I could not so soon cause the regrets rushing rapidly through\nmy mind to slacken their tide. Why did I make myself a tradesman? Why\ndid I enter Hunsden's house this evening? Why, at dawn to-morrow, must\nI repair to Crimsworth's mill? All that night did I ask myself these\nquestions, and all that night fiercely demanded of my soul an answer. I\ngot no sleep; my head burned, my feet froze; at last the factory bells\nrang, and I sprang from my bed with other slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHERE is a climax to everything, to every state of feeling as well as to\nevery position in life. I turned this truism over in my mind as, in the\nfrosty dawn of a January morning, I hurried down the steep and now\nicy street which descended from Mrs. King's to the Close. The factory\nworkpeople had preceded me by nearly an hour, and the mill was all\nlighted up and in full operation when I reached it. I repaired to my\npost in the counting-house as usual; the fire there, but just lit, as\nyet only smoked; Steighton had not yet arrived. I shut the door and sat\ndown at the desk; my hands, recently washed in half-frozen water, were\nstill numb; I could not write till they had regained vitality, so I\nwent on thinking, and still the theme of my thoughts was the \"climax.\"\nSelf-dissatisfaction troubled exceedingly the current of my meditations.\n\n\"Come, William Crimsworth,\" said my conscience, or whatever it is that\nwithin ourselves takes ourselves to task--\"come, get a clear notion of\nwhat you would have, or what you would not have. You talk of a climax;\npray has your endurance reached its climax? It is not four months old.\nWhat a fine resolute fellow you imagined yourself to be when you told\nTynedale you would tread in your father's steps, and a pretty treading\nyou are likely to make of it! How well you like X----! Just at this\nmoment how redolent of pleasant associations are its streets, its shops,\nits warehouses, its factories! How the prospect of this day cheers\nyou! Letter-copying till noon, solitary dinner at your lodgings,\nletter-copying till evening, solitude; for you neither find pleasure\nin Brown's, nor Smith's, nor Nicholl's, nor Eccle's company; and as\nto Hunsden, you fancied there was pleasure to be derived from his\nsociety--he! he! how did you like the taste you had of him last night?\nwas it sweet? Yet he is a talented, an original-minded man, and even\nhe does not like you; your self-respect defies you to like him; he has\nalways seen you to disadvantage; he always will see you to disadvantage;\nyour positions are unequal, and were they on the same level your\nminds could not assimilate; never hope, then, to gather the honey of\nfriendship out of that thorn-guarded plant. Hello, Crimsworth! where are\nyour thoughts tending? You leave the recollection of Hunsden as a bee\nwould a rock, as a bird a desert; and your aspirations spread eager\nwings towards a land of visions where, now in advancing daylight--in\nX---- daylight--you dare to dream of congeniality, repose, union. Those\nthree you will never meet in this world; they are angels. The souls of\njust men made perfect may encounter them in heaven, but your soul will\nnever be made perfect. Eight o'clock strikes! your hands are thawed, get\nto work!\"\n\n\"Work? why should I work?\" said I sullenly: \"I cannot please though I\ntoil like a slave.\" \"Work, work!\" reiterated the inward voice. \"I may\nwork, it will do no good,\" I growled; but nevertheless I drew out a\npacket of letters and commenced my task--task thankless and bitter as\nthat of the Israelite crawling over the sun-baked fields of Egypt in\nsearch of straw and stubble wherewith to accomplish his tale of bricks.\n\nAbout ten o'clock I heard Mr. Crimsworth's gig turn into the yard, and\nin a minute or two he entered the counting-house. It was his custom to\nglance his eye at Steighton and myself, to hang up his mackintosh, stand\na minute with his back to the fire, and then walk out. Today he did\nnot deviate from his usual habits; the only difference was that when\nhe looked at me, his brow, instead of being merely hard, was surly; his\neye, instead of being cold, was fierce. He studied me a minute or two\nlonger than usual, but went out in silence.\n\nTwelve o'clock arrived; the bell rang for a suspension of labour; the\nworkpeople went off to their dinners; Steighton, too, departed, desiring\nme to lock the counting-house door, and take the key with me. I\nwas tying up a bundle of papers, and putting them in their place,\npreparatory to closing my desk, when Crimsworth reappeared at the door,\nand entering closed it behind him.\n\n\"You'll stay here a minute,\" said he, in a deep, brutal voice, while his\nnostrils distended and his eye shot a spark of sinister fire.\n\nAlone with Edward I remembered our relationship, and remembering that\nforgot the difference of position; I put away deference and careful\nforms of speech; I answered with simple brevity.\n\n\"It is time to go home,\" I said, turning the key in my desk.\n\n\"You'll stay here!\" he reiterated. \"And take your hand off that key!\nleave it in the lock!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked I. \"What cause is there for changing my usual plans?\"\n\n\"Do as I order,\" was the answer, \"and no questions! You are my servant,\nobey me! What have you been about--?\" He was going on in the same\nbreath, when an abrupt pause announced that rage had for the moment got\nthe better of articulation.\n\n\"You may look, if you wish to know,\" I replied. \"There is the open desk,\nthere are the papers.\"\n\n\"Confound your insolence! What have you been about?\"\n\n\"Your work, and have done it well.\"\n\n\"Hypocrite and twaddler! Smooth-faced, snivelling greasehorn!\" (This\nlast term is, I believe, purely ----shire, and alludes to the horn of\nblack, rancid whale-oil, usually to be seen suspended to cart-wheels,\nand employed for greasing the same.)\n\n\"Come, Edward Crimsworth, enough of this. It is time you and I wound up\naccounts. I have now given your service three months' trial, and I find\nit the most nauseous slavery under the sun. Seek another clerk. I stay\nno longer.\"\n\n\"What! do you dare to give me notice? Stop at least for your wages.\" He\ntook down the heavy gig whip hanging beside his mackintosh.\n\nI permitted myself to laugh with a degree of scorn I took no pains to\ntemper or hide. His fury boiled up, and when he had sworn half-a-dozen\nvulgar, impious oaths, without, however, venturing to lift the whip, he\ncontinued:\n\n\"I've found you out and know you thoroughly, you mean, whining\nlickspittle! What have you been saying all over X---- about me? answer\nme that!\"\n\n\"You? I have neither inclination nor temptation to talk about you.\"\n\n\"You lie! It is your practice to talk about me; it is your constant\nhabit to make public complaint of the treatment you receive at my hands.\nYou have gone and told it far and near that I give you low wages and\nknock you about like a dog. I wish you were a dog! I'd set-to this\nminute, and never stir from the spot till I'd cut every strip of flesh\nfrom your bones with this whip.\"\n\nHe flourished his tool. The end of the lash just touched my forehead.\nA warm excited thrill ran through my veins, my blood seemed to give a\nbound, and then raced fast and hot along its channels. I got up nimbly,\ncame round to where he stood, and faced him.\n\n\"Down with your whip!\" said I, \"and explain this instant what you mean.\"\n\n\"Sirrah! to whom are you speaking?\"\n\n\"To you. There is no one else present, I think. You say I have been\ncalumniating you--complaining of your low wages and bad treatment. Give\nyour grounds for these assertions.\"\n\nCrimsworth had no dignity, and when I sternly demanded an explanation,\nhe gave one in a loud, scolding voice.\n\n\"Grounds! you shall have them; and turn to the light that I may see your\nbrazen face blush black, when you hear yourself proved to be a liar and\na hypocrite. At a public meeting in the Town-hall yesterday, I had the\npleasure of hearing myself insulted by the speaker opposed to me in the\nquestion under discussion, by allusions to my private affairs; by cant\nabout monsters without natural affection, family despots, and such\ntrash; and when I rose to answer, I was met by a shout from the filthy\nmob, where the mention of your name enabled me at once to detect the\nquarter in which this base attack had originated. When I looked round, I\nsaw that treacherous villain, Hunsden acting as fugleman. I detected you\nin close conversation with Hunsden at my house a month ago, and I know\nthat you were at Hunsden's rooms last night. Deny it if you dare.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall not deny it! And if Hunsden hounded on the people to hiss\nyou, he did quite right. You deserve popular execration; for a worse\nman, a harder master, a more brutal brother than you are has seldom\nexisted.\"\n\n\"Sirrah! sirrah!\" reiterated Crimsworth; and to complete his apostrophe,\nhe cracked the whip straight over my head.\n\nA minute sufficed to wrest it from him, break it in two pieces, and\nthrow it under the grate. He made a headlong rush at me, which I evaded,\nand said--\n\n\"Touch me, and I'll have you up before the nearest magistrate.\"\n\nMen like Crimsworth, if firmly and calmly resisted, always abate\nsomething of their exorbitant insolence; he had no mind to be brought\nbefore a magistrate, and I suppose he saw I meant what I said. After\nan odd and long stare at me, at once bull-like and amazed, he seemed\nto bethink himself that, after all, his money gave him sufficient\nsuperiority over a beggar like me, and that he had in his hands a surer\nand more dignified mode of revenge than the somewhat hazardous one of\npersonal chastisement.\n\n\"Take your hat,\" said he. \"Take what belongs to you, and go out at\nthat door; get away to your parish, you pauper: beg, steal, starve, get\ntransported, do what you like; but at your peril venture again into\nmy sight! If ever I hear of your setting foot on an inch of ground\nbelonging to me, I'll hire a man to cane you.\"\n\n\"It is not likely you'll have the chance; once off your premises, what\ntemptation can I have to return to them? I leave a prison, I leave a\ntyrant; I leave what is worse than the worst that can lie before me, so\nno fear of my coming back.\"\n\n\"Go, or I'll make you!\" exclaimed Crimsworth.\n\nI walked deliberately to my desk, took out such of its contents as were\nmy own property, put them in my pocket, locked the desk, and placed the\nkey on the top.\n\n\"What are you abstracting from that desk?\" demanded the millowner.\n\"Leave all behind in its place, or I'll send for a policeman to search\nyou.\"\n\n\"Look sharp about it, then,\" said I, and I took down my hat, drew on my\ngloves, and walked leisurely out of the counting-house--walked out of it\nto enter it no more.\n\nI recollect that when the mill-bell rang the dinner hour, before Mr.\nCrimsworth entered, and the scene above related took place, I had had\nrather a sharp appetite, and had been waiting somewhat impatiently to\nhear the signal of feeding time. I forgot it now, however; the images\nof potatoes and roast mutton were effaced from my mind by the stir and\ntumult which the transaction of the last half-hour had there excited. I\nonly thought of walking, that the action of my muscles might harmonize\nwith the action of my nerves; and walk I did, fast and far. How could\nI do otherwise? A load was lifted off my heart; I felt light and\nliberated. I had got away from Bigben Close without a breach of\nresolution; without injury to my self-respect. I had not forced\ncircumstances; circumstances had freed me. Life was again open to me;\nno longer was its horizon limited by the high black wall surrounding\nCrimsworth's mill. Two hours had elapsed before my sensations had so far\nsubsided as to leave me calm enough to remark for what wider and clearer\nboundaries I had exchanged that sooty girdle. When I did look up, lo!\nstraight before me lay Grovetown, a village of villas about five miles\nout of X----. The short winter day, as I perceived from the far-declined\nsun, was already approaching its close; a chill frost-mist was rising\nfrom the river on which X---- stands, and along whose banks the road I\nhad taken lay; it dimmed the earth, but did not obscure the clear icy\nblue of the January sky. There was a great stillness near and far; the\ntime of the day favoured tranquillity, as the people were all employed\nwithin-doors, the hour of evening release from the factories not being\nyet arrived; a sound of full-flowing water alone pervaded the air, for\nthe river was deep and abundant, swelled by the melting of a late snow.\nI stood awhile, leaning over a wall; and looking down at the current:\nI watched the rapid rush of its waves. I desired memory to take a clear\nand permanent impression of the scene, and treasure it for future years.\nGrovetown church clock struck four; looking up, I beheld the last of\nthat day's sun, glinting red through the leafless boughs of some\nvery old oak trees surrounding the church--its light coloured and\ncharacterized the picture as I wished. I paused yet a moment, till the\nsweet, slow sound of the bell had quite died out of the air; then ear,\neye and feeling satisfied, I quitted the wall and once more turned my\nface towards X----.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nI RE-ENTERED the town a hungry man; the dinner I had forgotten recurred\nseductively to my recollection; and it was with a quick step and sharp\nappetite I ascended the narrow street leading to my lodgings. It was\ndark when I opened the front door and walked into the house. I wondered\nhow my fire would be; the night was cold, and I shuddered at the\nprospect of a grate full of sparkless cinders. To my joyful surprise,\nI found, on entering my sitting-room, a good fire and a clean hearth.\nI had hardly noticed this phenomenon, when I became aware of another\nsubject for wonderment; the chair I usually occupied near the hearth was\nalready filled; a person sat there with his arms folded on his chest,\nand his legs stretched out on the rug. Short-sighted as I am, doubtful\nas was the gleam of the firelight, a moment's examination enabled me to\nrecognize in this person my acquaintance, Mr. Hunsden. I could not of\ncourse be much pleased to see him, considering the manner in which I had\nparted from him the night before, and as I walked to the hearth, stirred\nthe fire, and said coolly, \"Good evening,\" my demeanour evinced as\nlittle cordiality as I felt; yet I wondered in my own mind what had\nbrought him there; and I wondered, also, what motives had induced him to\ninterfere so actively between me and Edward; it was to him, it appeared,\nthat I owed my welcome dismissal; still I could not bring myself to\nask him questions, to show any eagerness of curiosity; if he chose to\nexplain, he might, but the explanation should be a perfectly voluntary\none on his part; I thought he was entering upon it.\n\n\"You owe me a debt of gratitude,\" were his first words.\n\n\"Do I?\" said I; \"I hope it is not a large one, for I am much too poor to\ncharge myself with heavy liabilities of any kind.\"\n\n\"Then declare yourself bankrupt at once, for this liability is a ton\nweight at least. When I came in I found your fire out, and I had it lit\nagain, and made that sulky drab of a servant stay and blow at it with\nthe bellows till it had burnt up properly; now, say 'Thank you!'\"\n\n\"Not till I have had something to eat; I can thank nobody while I am so\nfamished.\"\n\nI rang the bell and ordered tea and some cold meat.\n\n\"Cold meat!\" exclaimed Hunsden, as the servant closed the door, \"what a\nglutton you are; man! Meat with tea! you'll die of eating too much.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Hunsden, I shall not.\" I felt a necessity for contradicting\nhim; I was irritated with hunger, and irritated at seeing him there, and\nirritated at the continued roughness of his manner.\n\n\"It is over-eating that makes you so ill-tempered,\" said he.\n\n\"How do you know?\" I demanded. \"It is like you to give a pragmatical\nopinion without being acquainted with any of the circumstances of the\ncase; I have had no dinner.\"\n\nWhat I said was petulant and snappish enough, and Hunsden only replied\nby looking in my face and laughing.\n\n\"Poor thing!\" he whined, after a pause. \"It has had no dinner, has it?\nWhat! I suppose its master would not let it come home. Did Crimsworth\norder you to fast by way of punishment, William!\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Hunsden.\" Fortunately at this sulky juncture, tea, was brought\nin, and I fell to upon some bread and butter and cold beef directly.\nHaving cleared a plateful, I became so far humanized as to intimate to\nMr. Hunsden that he need not sit there staring, but might come to the\ntable and do as I did, if he liked.\n\n\"But I don't like in the least,\" said he, and therewith he summoned the\nservant by a fresh pull of the bell-rope, and intimated a desire to\nhave a glass of toast-and-water. \"And some more coal,\" he added; \"Mr.\nCrimsworth shall keep a good fire while I stay.\"\n\nHis orders being executed, he wheeled his chair round to the table, so\nas to be opposite me.\n\n\"Well,\" he proceeded. \"You are out of work, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I; and not disposed to show the satisfaction I felt on this\npoint, I, yielding to the whim of the moment, took up the subject as\nthough I considered myself aggrieved rather than benefited by what had\nbeen done. \"Yes--thanks to you, I am. Crimsworth turned me off at\na minute's notice, owing to some interference of yours at a public\nmeeting, I understand.\"\n\n\"Ah! what! he mentioned that? He observed me signalling the lads, did\nhe? What had he to say about his friend Hunsden--anything sweet?\"\n\n\"He called you a treacherous villain.\"\n\n\"Oh, he hardly knows me yet! I'm one of those shy people who don't come\nout all at once, and he is only just beginning to make my acquaintance,\nbut he'll find I've some good qualities--excellent ones! The Hunsdens\nwere always unrivalled at tracking a rascal; a downright, dishonourable\nvillain is their natural prey--they could not keep off him wherever\nthey met him; you used the word pragmatical just now--that word is the\nproperty of our family; it has been applied to us from generation to\ngeneration; we have fine noses for abuses; we scent a scoundrel a mile\noff; we are reformers born, radical reformers; and it was impossible for\nme to live in the same town with Crimsworth, to come into weekly contact\nwith him, to witness some of his conduct to you (for whom personally\nI care nothing; I only consider the brutal injustice with which he\nviolated your natural claim to equality)--I say it was impossible for\nme to be thus situated and not feel the angel or the demon of my race\nat work within me. I followed my instinct, opposed a tyrant, and broke a\nchain.\"\n\nNow this speech interested me much, both because it brought out\nHunsden's character, and because it explained his motives; it interested\nme so much that I forgot to reply to it, and sat silent, pondering over\na throng of ideas it had suggested.\n\n\"Are you grateful to me?\" he asked, presently.\n\nIn fact I was grateful, or almost so, and I believe I half liked him at\nthe moment, notwithstanding his proviso that what he had done was not\nout of regard for me. But human nature is perverse. Impossible to answer\nhis blunt question in the affirmative, so I disclaimed all tendency\nto gratitude, and advised him if he expected any reward for his\nchampionship, to look for it in a better world, as he was not likely\nto meet with it here. In reply he termed me \"a dry-hearted aristocratic\nscamp,\" whereupon I again charged him with having taken the bread out of\nmy mouth.\n\n\"Your bread was dirty, man!\" cried Hunsden--\"dirty and unwholesome!\nIt came through the hands of a tyrant, for I tell you Crimsworth is a\ntyrant,--a tyrant to his workpeople, a tyrant to his clerks, and will\nsome day be a tyrant to his wife.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! bread is bread, and a salary is a salary. I've lost mine, and\nthrough your means.\"\n\n\"There's sense in what you say, after all,\" rejoined Hunsden. \"I must\nsay I am rather agreeably surprised to hear you make so practical\nan observation as that last. I had imagined now, from my previous\nobservation of your character, that the sentimental delight you would\nhave taken in your newly regained liberty would, for a while at least,\nhave effaced all ideas of forethought and prudence. I think better of\nyou for looking steadily to the needful.\"\n\n\"Looking steadily to the needful! How can I do otherwise? I must live,\nand to live I must have what you call 'the needful,' which I can only\nget by working. I repeat it, you have taken my work from me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" pursued Hunsden coolly. \"You have influential\nrelations; I suppose they'll soon provide you with another place.\"\n\n\"Influential relations? Who? I should like to know their names.\"\n\n\"The Seacombes.\"\n\n\"Stuff! I have cut them.\"\n\nHunsden looked at me incredulously.\n\n\"I have,\" said I, \"and that definitively.\"\n\n\"You must mean they have cut you, William.\"\n\n\"As you please. They offered me their patronage on condition of my\nentering the Church; I declined both the terms and the recompence; I\nwithdrew from my cold uncles, and preferred throwing myself into my\nelder brother's arms, from whose affectionate embrace I am now torn by\nthe cruel intermeddling of a stranger--of yourself, in short.\"\n\nI could not repress a half-smile as I said this; a similar\ndemi-manifestation of feeling appeared at the same moment on Hunsden's\nlips.\n\n\"Oh, I see!\" said he, looking into my eyes, and it was evident he did\nsee right down into my heart. Having sat a minute or two with his chin\nresting on his hand, diligently occupied in the continued perusal of my\ncountenance, he went on:\n\n\"Seriously, have you then nothing to expect from the Seacombes?\"\n\n\"Yes, rejection and repulsion. Why do you ask me twice? How can hands\nstained with the ink of a counting-house, soiled with the grease of\na wool-warehouse, ever again be permitted to come into contact with\naristocratic palms?\"\n\n\"There would be a difficulty, no doubt; still you are such a complete\nSeacombe in appearance, feature, language, almost manner, I wonder they\nshould disown you.\"\n\n\"They have disowned me; so talk no more about it.\"\n\n\"Do you regret it, William?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why not, lad?\"\n\n\"Because they are not people with whom I could ever have had any\nsympathy.\"\n\n\"I say you are one of them.\"\n\n\"That merely proves that you know nothing at all about it; I am my\nmother's son, but not my uncles' nephew.\"\n\n\"Still--one of your uncles is a lord, though rather an obscure and not a\nvery wealthy one, and the other a right honourable: you should consider\nworldly interest.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Mr. Hunsden. You know or may know that even had I desired to\nbe submissive to my uncles, I could not have stooped with a good enough\ngrace ever to have won their favour. I should have sacrificed my own\ncomfort and not have gained their patronage in return.\"\n\n\"Very likely--so you calculated your wisest plan was to follow your own\ndevices at once?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I must follow my own devices--I must, till the day of my\ndeath; because I can neither comprehend, adopt, nor work out those of\nother people.\"\n\nHunsden yawned. \"Well,\" said he, \"in all this, I see but one thing\nclearly-that is, that the whole affair is no business of mine.\" He\nstretched himself and again yawned. \"I wonder what time it is,\" he went\non: \"I have an appointment for seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Three quarters past six by my watch.\"\n\n\"Well, then I'll go.\" He got up. \"You'll not meddle with trade again?\"\nsaid he, leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"No; I think not.\"\n\n\"You would be a fool if you did. Probably, after all, you'll think\nbetter of your uncles' proposal and go into the Church.\"\n\n\"A singular regeneration must take place in my whole inner and outer man\nbefore I do that. A good clergyman is one of the best of men.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Do you think so?\" interrupted Hunsden, scoffingly.\n\n\"I do, and no mistake. But I have not the peculiar points which go to\nmake a good clergyman; and rather than adopt a profession for which I\nhave no vocation, I would endure extremities of hardship from poverty.\"\n\n\"You're a mighty difficult customer to suit. You won't be a tradesman\nor a parson; you can't be a lawyer, or a doctor, or a gentleman, because\nyou've no money. I'd recommend you to travel.\"\n\n\"What! without money?\"\n\n\"You must travel in search of money, man. You can speak French--with\na vile English accent, no doubt--still, you can speak it. Go on to the\nContinent, and see what will turn up for you there.\"\n\n\"God knows I should like to go!\" exclaimed I with involuntary ardour.\n\n\"Go: what the deuce hinders you? You may get to Brussels, for instance,\nfor five or six pounds, if you know how to manage with economy.\"\n\n\"Necessity would teach me if I didn't.\"\n\n\"Go, then, and let your wits make a way for you when you get there. I\nknow Brussels almost as well as I know X----, and I am sure it would\nsuit such a one as you better than London.\"\n\n\"But occupation, Mr. Hunsden! I must go where occupation is to be had;\nand how could I get recommendation, or introduction, or employment at\nBrussels?\"\n\n\"There speaks the organ of caution. You hate to advance a step before\nyou know every inch of the way. You haven't a sheet of paper and a\npen-and-ink?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" and I produced writing materials with alacrity; for I\nguessed what he was going to do. He sat down, wrote a few lines, folded,\nsealed, and addressed a letter, and held it out to me.\n\n\"There, Prudence, there's a pioneer to hew down the first rough\ndifficulties of your path. I know well enough, lad, you are not one of\nthose who will run their neck into a noose without seeing how they\nare to get it out again, and you're right there. A reckless man is\nmy aversion, and nothing should ever persuade me to meddle with the\nconcerns of such a one. Those who are reckless for themselves are\ngenerally ten times more so for their friends.\"\n\n\"This is a letter of introduction, I suppose?\" said I, taking the\nepistle.\n\n\"Yes. With that in your pocket you will run no risk of finding yourself\nin a state of absolute destitution, which, I know, you will regard as a\ndegradation--so should I, for that matter. The person to whom you will\npresent it generally has two or three respectable places depending upon\nhis recommendation.\"\n\n\"That will just suit me,\" said I.\n\n\"Well, and where's your gratitude?\" demanded Mr. Hunsden; \"don't you\nknow how to say 'Thank you?'\"\n\n\"I've fifteen pounds and a watch, which my godmother, whom I never saw,\ngave me eighteen years ago,\" was my rather irrelevant answer; and I\nfurther avowed myself a happy man, and professed that I did not envy any\nbeing in Christendom.\n\n\"But your gratitude?\"\n\n\"I shall be off presently, Mr. Hunsden--to-morrow, if all be well: I'll\nnot stay a day longer in X---- than I'm obliged.\"\n\n\"Very good--but it will be decent to make due acknowledgment for the\nassistance you have received; be quick! It is just going to strike\nseven: I'm waiting to be thanked.\"\n\n\"Just stand out of the way, will you, Mr. Hunsden: I want a key there is\non the corner of the mantelpiece. I'll pack my portmanteau before I go\nto bed.\"\n\nThe house clock struck seven.\n\n\"The lad is a heathen,\" said Hunsden, and taking his hat from a\nsideboard, he left the room, laughing to himself. I had half an\ninclination to follow him: I really intended to leave X---- the next\nmorning, and should certainly not have another opportunity of bidding\nhim good-bye. The front door banged to.\n\n\"Let him go,\" said I, \"we shall meet again some day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nREADER, perhaps you were never in Belgium? Haply you don't know the\nphysiognomy of the country? You have not its lineaments defined upon\nyour memory, as I have them on mine?\n\nThree--nay four--pictures line the four-walled cell where are stored for\nme the records of the past. First, Eton. All in that picture is in far\nperspective, receding, diminutive; but freshly coloured, green, dewy,\nwith a spring sky, piled with glittering yet showery clouds; for my\nchildhood was not all sunshine--it had its overcast, its cold, its\nstormy hours. Second, X----, huge, dingy; the canvas cracked and smoked;\na yellow sky, sooty clouds; no sun, no azure; the verdure of the suburbs\nblighted and sullied--a very dreary scene.\n\nThird, Belgium; and I will pause before this landscape. As to the\nfourth, a curtain covers it, which I may hereafter withdraw, or may not,\nas suits my convenience and capacity. At any rate, for the present it\nmust hang undisturbed. Belgium! name unromantic and unpoetic, yet name\nthat whenever uttered has in my ear a sound, in my heart an echo, such\nas no other assemblage of syllables, however sweet or classic, can\nproduce. Belgium! I repeat the word, now as I sit alone near midnight.\nIt stirs my world of the past like a summons to resurrection; the graves\nunclose, the dead are raised; thoughts, feelings, memories that slept,\nare seen by me ascending from the clouds--haloed most of them--but while\nI gaze on their vapoury forms, and strive to ascertain definitely their\noutline, the sound which wakened them dies, and they sink, each and all,\nlike a light wreath of mist, absorbed in the mould, recalled to urns,\nresealed in monuments. Farewell, luminous phantoms!\n\nThis is Belgium, reader. Look! don't call the picture a flat or a dull\none--it was neither flat nor dull to me when I first beheld it. When I\nleft Ostend on a mild February morning, and found myself on the road\nto Brussels, nothing could look vapid to me. My sense of enjoyment\npossessed an edge whetted to the finest, untouched, keen, exquisite.\nI was young; I had good health; pleasure and I had never met; no\nindulgence of hers had enervated or sated one faculty of my nature.\nLiberty I clasped in my arms for the first time, and the influence of\nher smile and embrace revived my life like the sun and the west wind.\nYes, at that epoch I felt like a morning traveller who doubts not that\nfrom the hill he is ascending he shall behold a glorious sunrise; what\nif the track be strait, steep, and stony? he sees it not; his eyes are\nfixed on that summit, flushed already, flushed and gilded, and having\ngained it he is certain of the scene beyond. He knows that the sun will\nface him, that his chariot is even now coming over the eastern horizon,\nand that the herald breeze he feels on his cheek is opening for the\ngod's career a clear, vast path of azure, amidst clouds soft as pearl\nand warm as flame. Difficulty and toil were to be my lot, but sustained\nby energy, drawn on by hopes as bright as vague, I deemed such a lot\nno hardship. I mounted now the hill in shade; there were pebbles,\ninequalities, briars in my path, but my eyes were fixed on the crimson\npeak above; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament beyond, and\nI thought nothing of the stones turning under my feet, or of the thorns\nscratching my face and hands.\n\nI gazed often, and always with delight, from the window of the diligence\n(these, be it remembered, were not the days of trains and railroads).\nWell! and what did I see? I will tell you faithfully. Green, reedy\nswamps; fields fertile but flat, cultivated in patches that made them\nlook like magnified kitchen-gardens; belts of cut trees, formal as\npollard willows, skirting the horizon; narrow canals, gliding slow by\nthe road-side; painted Flemish farmhouses; some very dirty hovels; a\ngray, dead sky; wet road, wet fields, wet house-tops: not a beautiful,\nscarcely a picturesque object met my eye along the whole route; yet to\nme, all was beautiful, all was more than picturesque. It continued fair\nso long as daylight lasted, though the moisture of many preceding damp\ndays had sodden the whole country; as it grew dark, however, the rain\nrecommenced, and it was through streaming and starless darkness my eye\ncaught the first gleam of the lights of Brussels. I saw little of the\ncity but its lights that night. Having alighted from the diligence, a\nfiacre conveyed me to the Hotel de ----, where I had been advised by a\nfellow-traveller to put up; having eaten a traveller's supper, I retired\nto bed, and slept a traveller's sleep.\n\nNext morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the impression\nthat I was yet in X----, and perceiving it to be broad daylight I\nstarted up, imagining that I had overslept myself and should be behind\ntime at the counting-house. The momentary and painful sense of restraint\nvanished before the revived and reviving consciousness of freedom, as,\nthrowing back the white curtains of my bed, I looked forth into a wide,\nlofty foreign chamber; how different from the small and dingy, though\nnot uncomfortable, apartment I had occupied for a night or two at a\nrespectable inn in London while waiting for the sailing of the packet!\nYet far be it from me to profane the memory of that little dingy room!\nIt, too, is dear to my soul; for there, as I lay in quiet and darkness,\nI first heard the great bell of St. Paul's telling London it was\nmidnight, and well do I recall the deep, deliberate tones, so full\ncharged with colossal phlegm and force. From the small, narrow window\nof that room, I first saw THE dome, looming through a London mist. I\nsuppose the sensations, stirred by those first sounds, first sights, are\nfelt but once; treasure them, Memory; seal them in urns, and keep them\nin safe niches! Well--I rose. Travellers talk of the apartments in\nforeign dwellings being bare and uncomfortable; I thought my chamber\nlooked stately and cheerful. It had such large windows--CROISEES that\nopened like doors, with such broad, clear panes of glass; such a great\nlooking-glass stood on my dressing-table--such a fine mirror glittered\nover the mantelpiece--the painted floor looked so clean and glossy;\nwhen I had dressed and was descending the stairs, the broad marble steps\nalmost awed me, and so did the lofty hall into which they conducted.\nOn the first landing I met a Flemish housemaid: she had wooden shoes, a\nshort red petticoat, a printed cotton bedgown, her face was broad,\nher physiognomy eminently stupid; when I spoke to her in French, she\nanswered me in Flemish, with an air the reverse of civil; yet I thought\nher charming; if she was not pretty or polite, she was, I conceived,\nvery picturesque; she reminded me of the female figures in certain Dutch\npaintings I had seen in other years at Seacombe Hall.\n\nI repaired to the public room; that, too, was very large and very lofty,\nand warmed by a stove; the floor was black, and the stove was black, and\nmost of the furniture was black: yet I never experienced a freer\nsense of exhilaration than when I sat down at a very long, black table\n(covered, however, in part by a white cloth), and, having ordered\nbreakfast, began to pour out my coffee from a little black coffee-pot.\nThe stove might be dismal-looking to some eyes, not to mine, but it\nwas indisputably very warm, and there were two gentlemen seated by\nit talking in French; impossible to follow their rapid utterance, or\ncomprehend much of the purport of what they said--yet French, in the\nmouths of Frenchmen, or Belgians (I was not then sensible of the horrors\nof the Belgian accent) was as music to my ears. One of these gentlemen\npresently discerned me to be an Englishman--no doubt from the fashion in\nwhich I addressed the waiter; for I would persist in speaking French in\nmy execrable South-of-England style, though the man understood English.\nThe gentleman, after looking towards me once or twice, politely accosted\nme in very good English; I remember I wished to God that I could speak\nFrench as well; his fluency and correct pronunciation impressed me for\nthe first time with a due notion of the cosmopolitan character of the\ncapital I was in; it was my first experience of that skill in living\nlanguages I afterwards found to be so general in Brussels.\n\nI lingered over my breakfast as long as I could; while it was there\non the table, and while that stranger continued talking to me, I was a\nfree, independent traveller; but at last the things were removed, the\ntwo gentlemen left the room; suddenly the illusion ceased, reality and\nbusiness came back. I, a bondsman just released from the yoke, freed for\none week from twenty-one years of constraint, must, of necessity, resume\nthe fetters of dependency. Hardly had I tasted the delight of being\nwithout a master when duty issued her stern mandate: \"Go forth and seek\nanother service.\" I never linger over a painful and necessary task; I\nnever take pleasure before business, it is not in my nature to do so;\nimpossible to enjoy a leisurely walk over the city, though I perceived\nthe morning was very fine, until I had first presented Mr. Hunsden's\nletter of introduction, and got fairly on to the track of a new\nsituation. Wrenching my mind from liberty and delight, I seized my hat,\nand forced my reluctant body out of the Hotel de ---- into the foreign\nstreet.\n\nIt was a fine day, but I would not look at the blue sky or at the\nstately houses round me; my mind was bent on one thing, finding out \"Mr.\nBrown, Numero --, Rue Royale,\" for so my letter was addressed. By dint\nof inquiry I succeeded; I stood at last at the desired door, knocked,\nasked for Mr. Brown, and was admitted.\n\nBeing shown into a small breakfast-room, I found myself in the\npresence of an elderly gentleman--very grave, business-like, and\nrespectable-looking. I presented Mr. Hunsden's letter; he received me\nvery civilly. After a little desultory conversation he asked me if there\nwas anything in which his advice or experience could be of use. I said,\n\"Yes,\" and then proceeded to tell him that I was not a gentleman of\nfortune, travelling for pleasure, but an ex-counting-house clerk, who\nwanted employment of some kind, and that immediately too. He replied\nthat as a friend of Mr. Hunsden's he would be willing to assist me as\nwell as he could. After some meditation he named a place in a mercantile\nhouse at Liege, and another in a bookseller's shop at Louvain.\n\n\"Clerk and shopman!\" murmured I to myself. \"No.\" I shook my head. I\nhad tried the high stool; I hated it; I believed there were other\noccupations that would suit me better; besides I did not wish to leave\nBrussels.\n\n\"I know of no place in Brussels,\" answered Mr. Brown, \"unless indeed you\nwere disposed to turn your attention to teaching. I am acquainted with\nthe director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of\nEnglish and Latin.\"\n\nI thought two minutes, then I seized the idea eagerly.\n\n\"The very thing, sir!\" said I.\n\n\"But,\" asked he, \"do you understand French well enough to teach Belgian\nboys English?\"\n\nFortunately I could answer this question in the affirmative;\nhaving studied French under a Frenchman, I could speak the language\nintelligibly though not fluently. I could also read it well, and write\nit decently.\n\n\"Then,\" pursued Mr. Brown, \"I think I can promise you the place, for\nMonsieur Pelet will not refuse a professor recommended by me; but come\nhere again at five o'clock this afternoon, and I will introduce you to\nhim.\"\n\nThe word \"professor\" struck me. \"I am not a professor,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh,\" returned Mr. Brown, \"professor, here in Belgium, means a teacher,\nthat is all.\"\n\nMy conscience thus quieted, I thanked Mr. Brown, and, for the present,\nwithdrew. This time I stepped out into the street with a relieved heart;\nthe task I had imposed on myself for that day was executed. I might now\ntake some hours of holiday. I felt free to look up. For the first time\nI remarked the sparkling clearness of the air, the deep blue of the sky,\nthe gay clean aspect of the white-washed or painted houses; I saw what\na fine street was the Rue Royale, and, walking leisurely along its broad\npavement, I continued to survey its stately hotels, till the palisades,\nthe gates, and trees of the park appearing in sight, offered to my eye a\nnew attraction. I remember, before entering the park, I stood awhile to\ncontemplate the statue of General Belliard, and then I advanced to the\ntop of the great staircase just beyond, and I looked down into a narrow\nback street, which I afterwards learnt was called the Rue d'Isabelle.\nI well recollect that my eye rested on the green door of a rather large\nhouse opposite, where, on a brass plate, was inscribed, \"Pensionnat de\nDemoiselles.\" Pensionnat! The word excited an uneasy sensation in\nmy mind; it seemed to speak of restraint. Some of the demoiselles,\nexternats no doubt, were at that moment issuing from the door--I looked\nfor a pretty face amongst them, but their close, little French bonnets\nhid their features; in a moment they were gone.\n\nI had traversed a good deal of Brussels before five o'clock arrived,\nbut punctually as that hour struck I was again in the Rue Royale.\nRe-admitted to Mr. Brown's breakfast-room, I found him, as before,\nseated at the table, and he was not alone--a gentleman stood by the\nhearth. Two words of introduction designated him as my future master.\n\"M. Pelet, Mr. Crimsworth; Mr. Crimsworth, M. Pelet,\" a bow on each\nside finished the ceremony. I don't know what sort of a bow I made; an\nordinary one, I suppose, for I was in a tranquil, commonplace frame of\nmind; I felt none of the agitation which had troubled my first interview\nwith Edward Crimsworth. M. Pelet's bow was extremely polite, yet not\ntheatrical, scarcely French; he and I were presently seated opposite to\neach other. In a pleasing voice, low, and, out of consideration to my\nforeign ears, very distinct and deliberate, M. Pelet intimated that he\nhad just been receiving from \"le respectable M. Brown,\" an account of my\nattainments and character, which relieved him from all scruple as to\nthe propriety of engaging me as professor of English and Latin in\nhis establishment; nevertheless, for form's sake, he would put a few\nquestions to test my powers. He did, and expressed in flattering terms\nhis satisfaction at my answers. The subject of salary next came on; it\nwas fixed at one thousand francs per annum, besides board and lodging.\n\"And in addition,\" suggested M. Pelet, \"as there will be some hours\nin each day during which your services will not be required in my\nestablishment, you may, in time, obtain employment in other seminaries,\nand thus turn your vacant moments to profitable account.\"\n\nI thought this very kind, and indeed I found afterwards that the terms\non which M. Pelet had engaged me were really liberal for Brussels;\ninstruction being extremely cheap there on account of the number of\nteachers. It was further arranged that I should be installed in my new\npost the very next day, after which M. Pelet and I parted.\n\nWell, and what was he like? and what were my impressions concerning him?\nHe was a man of about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather\nemaciated figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes\nhollow; his features were pleasing and regular, they had a French\nturn (for M. Pelet was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth\nand parentage), yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic\nlineaments was, in his case, softened by a mild blue eye, and a\nmelancholy, almost suffering, expression of countenance; his physiognomy\nwas \"fine et spirituelle.\" I use two French words because they define\nbetter than any English terms the species of intelligence with which his\nfeatures were imbued. He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing\npersonage. I wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary\ncharacteristics of his profession, and almost feared he could not be\nstern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster. Externally at least\nM. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master, Edward\nCrimsworth.\n\nInfluenced by the impression I had received of his gentleness, I was a\ngood deal surprised when, on arriving the next day at my new employer's\nhouse, and being admitted to a first view of what was to be the\nsphere of my future labours, namely the large, lofty, and well-lighted\nschoolrooms, I beheld a numerous assemblage of pupils, boys of course,\nwhose collective appearance showed all the signs of a full, flourishing,\nand well-disciplined seminary. As I traversed the classes in company\nwith M. Pelet, a profound silence reigned on all sides, and if by chance\na murmur or a whisper arose, one glance from the pensive eye of this\nmost gentle pedagogue stilled it instantly. It was astonishing, I\nthought, how so mild a check could prove so effectual. When I had\nperambulated the length and breadth of the classes, M. Pelet turned and\nsaid to me--\n\n\"Would you object to taking the boys as they are, and testing their\nproficiency in English?\"\n\nThe proposal was unexpected. I had thought I should have been allowed at\nleast three days to prepare; but it is a bad omen to commence any career\nby hesitation, so I just stepped to the professor's desk near which we\nstood, and faced the circle of my pupils. I took a moment to collect\nmy thoughts, and likewise to frame in French the sentence by which I\nproposed to open business. I made it as short as possible:--\n\n\"Messieurs, prenez vos livres de lecture.\"\n\n\"Anglais ou Francais, monsieur?\" demanded a thickset, moon-faced young\nFlamand in a blouse. The answer was fortunately easy:--\n\n\"Anglais.\"\n\nI determined to give myself as little trouble as possible in this\nlesson; it would not do yet to trust my unpractised tongue with the\ndelivery of explanations; my accent and idiom would be too open to the\ncriticisms of the young gentlemen before me, relative to whom I felt\nalready it would be necessary at once to take up an advantageous\nposition, and I proceeded to employ means accordingly.\n\n\"Commencez!\" cried I, when they had all produced their books. The\nmoon-faced youth (by name Jules Vanderkelkov, as I afterwards learnt)\ntook the first sentence. The \"livre de lecture\" was the \"Vicar of\nWakefield,\" much used in foreign schools because it is supposed to\ncontain prime samples of conversational English; it might, however,\nhave been a Runic scroll for any resemblance the words, as enunciated by\nJules, bore to the language in ordinary use amongst the natives of Great\nBritain. My God! how he did snuffle, snort, and wheeze! All he said was\nsaid in his throat and nose, for it is thus the Flamands speak, but\nI heard him to the end of his paragraph without proffering a word of\ncorrection, whereat he looked vastly self-complacent, convinced,\nno doubt, that he had acquitted himself like a real born and bred\n\"Anglais.\" In the same unmoved silence I listened to a dozen in\nrotation, and when the twelfth had concluded with splutter, hiss, and\nmumble, I solemnly laid down the book.\n\n\"Arretez!\" said I. There was a pause, during which I regarded them all\nwith a steady and somewhat stern gaze; a dog, if stared at hard enough\nand long enough, will show symptoms of embarrassment, and so at length\ndid my bench of Belgians. Perceiving that some of the faces before me\nwere beginning to look sullen, and others ashamed, I slowly joined my\nhands, and ejaculated in a deep \"voix de poitrine\"--\n\n\"Comme c'est affreux!\"\n\nThey looked at each other, pouted, coloured, swung their heels; they\nwere not pleased, I saw, but they were impressed, and in the way\nI wished them to be. Having thus taken them down a peg in their\nself-conceit, the next step was to raise myself in their estimation; not\na very easy thing, considering that I hardly dared to speak for fear of\nbetraying my own deficiencies.\n\n\"Ecoutez, messieurs!\" said I, and I endeavoured to throw into my\naccents the compassionate tone of a superior being, who, touched by the\nextremity of the helplessness, which at first only excited his scorn,\ndeigns at length to bestow aid. I then began at the very beginning of\nthe \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" and read, in a slow, distinct voice, some\ntwenty pages, they all the while sitting mute and listening with fixed\nattention; by the time I had done nearly an hour had elapsed. I then\nrose and said:--\n\n\"C'est assez pour aujourd'hui, messieurs; demain nous recommencerons, et\nj'espere que tout ira bien.\"\n\nWith this oracular sentence I bowed, and in company with M. Pelet\nquitted the school-room.\n\n\"C'est bien! c'est tres bien!\" said my principal as we entered his\nparlour. \"Je vois que monsieur a de l'adresse; cela, me plait, car, dans\nl'instruction, l'adresse fait tout autant que le savoir.\"\n\nFrom the parlour M. Pelet conducted me to my apartment, my \"chambre,\"\nas Monsieur said with a certain air of complacency. It was a very small\nroom, with an excessively small bed, but M. Pelet gave me to understand\nthat I was to occupy it quite alone, which was of course a great\ncomfort. Yet, though so limited in dimensions, it had two windows. Light\nnot being taxed in Belgium, the people never grudge its admission into\ntheir houses; just here, however, this observation is not very APROPOS,\nfor one of these windows was boarded up; the open windows looked into\nthe boys' playground. I glanced at the other, as wondering what aspect\nit would present if disencumbered of the boards. M. Pelet read, I\nsuppose, the expression of my eye; he explained:--\n\n\"La fenetre fermee donne sur un jardin appartenant a un pensionnat\nde demoiselles,\" said he, \"et les convenances exigent--enfin, vous\ncomprenez--n'est-ce pas, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Oui, oui,\" was my reply, and I looked of course quite satisfied; but\nwhen M. Pelet had retired and closed the door after him, the first thing\nI did was to scrutinize closely the nailed boards, hoping to find\nsome chink or crevice which I might enlarge, and so get a peep at the\nconsecrated ground. My researches were vain, for the boards were well\njoined and strongly nailed. It is astonishing how disappointed I felt. I\nthought it would have been so pleasant to have looked out upon a\ngarden planted with flowers and trees, so amusing to have watched the\ndemoiselles at their play; to have studied female character in a variety\nof phases, myself the while sheltered from view by a modest muslin\ncurtain, whereas, owing doubtless to the absurd scruples of some old\nduenna of a directress, I had now only the option of looking at a bare\ngravelled court, with an enormous \"pas de geant\" in the middle, and the\nmonotonous walls and windows of a boys' school-house round. Not only\nthen, but many a time after, especially in moments of weariness and\nlow spirits, did I look with dissatisfied eyes on that most tantalizing\nboard, longing to tear it away and get a glimpse of the green region\nwhich I imagined to lie beyond. I knew a tree grew close up to the\nwindow, for though there were as yet no leaves to rustle, I often heard\nat night the tapping of branches against the panes. In the daytime,\nwhen I listened attentively, I could hear, even through the boards, the\nvoices of the demoiselles in their hours of recreation, and, to speak\nthe honest truth, my sentimental reflections were occasionally a trifle\ndisarranged by the not quite silvery, in fact the too often brazen\nsounds, which, rising from the unseen paradise below, penetrated\nclamorously into my solitude. Not to mince matters, it really seemed to\nme a doubtful case whether the lungs of Mdlle. Reuter's girls or those\nof M. Pelet's boys were the strongest, and when it came to shrieking\nthe girls indisputably beat the boys hollow. I forgot to say, by-the-by,\nthat Reuter was the name of the old lady who had had my window bearded\nup. I say old, for such I, of course, concluded her to be, judging from\nher cautious, chaperon-like proceedings; besides, nobody ever spoke of\nher as young. I remember I was very much amused when I first heard her\nChristian name; it was Zoraide--Mademoiselle Zoraide Reuter. But the\ncontinental nations do allow themselves vagaries in the choice of names,\nsuch as we sober English never run into. I think, indeed, we have too\nlimited a list to choose from.\n\nMeantime my path was gradually growing smooth before me. I, in a\nfew weeks, conquered the teasing difficulties inseparable from the\ncommencement of almost every career. Ere long I had acquired as much\nfacility in speaking French as set me at my ease with my pupils; and\nas I had encountered them on a right footing at the very beginning, and\ncontinued tenaciously to retain the advantage I had early gained, they\nnever attempted mutiny, which circumstance, all who are in any degree\nacquainted with the ongoings of Belgian schools, and who know the\nrelation in which professors and pupils too frequently stand towards\neach other in those establishments, will consider an important and\nuncommon one. Before concluding this chapter I will say a word on the\nsystem I pursued with regard to my classes: my experience may possibly\nbe of use to others.\n\nIt did not require very keen observation to detect the character of the\nyouth of Brabant, but it needed a certain degree of tact to adopt one's\nmeasures to their capacity. Their intellectual faculties were generally\nweak, their animal propensities strong; thus there was at once an\nimpotence and a kind of inert force in their natures; they were dull,\nbut they were also singularly stubborn, heavy as lead and, like lead,\nmost difficult to move. Such being the case, it would have been truly\nabsurd to exact from them much in the way of mental exertion; having\nshort memories, dense intelligence, feeble reflective powers, they\nrecoiled with repugnance from any occupation that demanded close study\nor deep thought. Had the abhorred effort been extorted from them by\ninjudicious and arbitrary measures on the part of the Professor, they\nwould have resisted as obstinately, as clamorously, as desperate swine;\nand though not brave singly, they were relentless acting EN MASSE.\n\nI understood that before my arrival in M. Pelet's establishment, the\ncombined insubordination of the pupils had effected the dismissal of\nmore than one English master. It was necessary then to exact only the\nmost moderate application from natures so little qualified to apply--to\nassist, in every practicable way, understandings so opaque and\ncontracted--to be ever gentle, considerate, yielding even, to a certain\npoint, with dispositions so irrationally perverse; but, having reached\nthat culminating point of indulgence, you must fix your foot, plant it,\nroot it in rock--become immutable as the towers of Ste. Gudule; for a\nstep--but half a step farther, and you would plunge headlong into the\ngulf of imbecility; there lodged, you would speedily receive proofs\nof Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and\nhandfuls of Low Country mud. You might smooth to the utmost the path of\nlearning, remove every pebble from the track; but then you must finally\ninsist with decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself\nto be led quietly along the prepared road. When I had brought down my\nlesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil's capacity--when I\nhad shown myself the mildest, the most tolerant of masters--a word of\nimpertinence, a movement of disobedience, changed me at once into\na despot. I offered then but one alternative--submission and\nacknowledgment of error, or ignominious expulsion. This system answered,\nand my influence, by degrees, became established on a firm basis. \"The\nboy is father to the man,\" it is said; and so I often thought when\nlooked at my boys and remembered the political history of their\nancestors. Pelet's school was merely an epitome of the Belgian nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nAND Pelet himself? How did I continue to like him? Oh, extremely well!\nNothing could be more smooth, gentlemanlike, and even friendly, than\nhis demeanour to me. I had to endure from him neither cold neglect,\nirritating interference, nor pretentious assumption of superiority. I\nfear, however, two poor, hard-worked Belgian ushers in the establishment\ncould not have said as much; to them the director's manner was\ninvariably dry, stern, and cool. I believe he perceived once or twice\nthat I was a little shocked at the difference he made between them and\nme, and accounted for it by saying, with a quiet sarcastic smile--\n\n\"Ce ne sont que des Flamands--allez!\"\n\nAnd then he took his cigar gently from his lips and spat on the painted\nfloor of the room in which we were sitting. Flamands certainly they\nwere, and both had the true Flamand physiognomy, where intellectual\ninferiority is marked in lines none can mistake; still they were men,\nand, in the main, honest men; and I could not see why their being\naboriginals of the flat, dull soil should serve as a pretext for\ntreating them with perpetual severity and contempt. This idea, of\ninjustice somewhat poisoned the pleasure I might otherwise have derived\nfrom Pelet's soft affable manner to myself. Certainly it was agreeable,\nwhen the day's work was over, to find one's employer an intelligent\nand cheerful companion; and if he was sometimes a little sarcastic\nand sometimes a little too insinuating, and if I did discover that\nhis mildness was more a matter of appearance than of reality--if I did\noccasionally suspect the existence of flint or steel under an external\ncovering of velvet--still we are none of us perfect; and weary as I was\nof the atmosphere of brutality and insolence in which I had constantly\nlived at X----, I had no inclination now, on casting anchor in calmer\nregions, to institute at once a prying search after defects that were\nscrupulously withdrawn and carefully veiled from my view. I was willing\nto take Pelet for what he seemed--to believe him benevolent and friendly\nuntil some untoward event should prove him otherwise. He was not\nmarried, and I soon perceived he had all a Frenchman's, all a Parisian's\nnotions about matrimony and women. I suspected a degree of laxity in\nhis code of morals, there was something so cold and BLASE in his tone\nwhenever he alluded to what he called \"le beau sexe;\" but he was too\ngentlemanlike to intrude topics I did not invite, and as he was really\nintelligent and really fond of intellectual subjects of discourse, he\nand I always found enough to talk about, without seeking themes in the\nmire. I hated his fashion of mentioning love; I abhorred, from my soul,\nmere licentiousness. He felt the difference of our notions, and, by\nmutual consent, we kept off ground debateable.\n\nPelet's house was kept and his kitchen managed by his mother, a real\nold Frenchwoman; she had been handsome--at least she told me so, and I\nstrove to believe her; she was now ugly, as only continental old women\ncan be; perhaps, though, her style of dress made her look uglier than\nshe really was. Indoors she would go about without cap, her grey hair\nstrangely dishevelled; then, when at home, she seldom wore a gown--only\na shabby cotton camisole; shoes, too, were strangers to her feet, and in\nlieu of them she sported roomy slippers, trodden down at the heels. On\nthe other hand, whenever it was her pleasure to appear abroad, as on\nSundays and fete-days, she would put on some very brilliant-coloured\ndress, usually of thin texture, a silk bonnet with a wreath of flowers,\nand a very fine shawl. She was not, in the main, an ill-natured old\nwoman, but an incessant and most indiscreet talker; she kept chiefly\nin and about the kitchen, and seemed rather to avoid her son's august\npresence; of him, indeed, she evidently stood in awe. When he reproved\nher, his reproofs were bitter and unsparing; but he seldom gave himself\nthat trouble.\n\nMadame Pelet had her own society, her own circle of chosen visitors,\nwhom, however, I seldom saw, as she generally entertained them in what\nshe called her \"cabinet,\" a small den of a place adjoining the kitchen,\nand descending into it by one or two steps. On these steps, by-the-by,\nI have not unfrequently seen Madame Pelet seated with a trencher on\nher knee, engaged in the threefold employment of eating her dinner,\ngossiping with her favourite servant, the housemaid, and scolding her\nantagonist, the cook; she never dined, and seldom indeed took any meal\nwith her son; and as to showing her face at the boys' table, that was\nquite out of the question. These details will sound very odd in English\nears, but Belgium is not England, and its ways are not our ways.\n\nMadame Pelet's habits of life, then, being taken into consideration,\nI was a good deal surprised when, one Thursday evening (Thursday was\nalways a half-holiday), as I was sitting all alone in my apartment,\ncorrecting a huge pile of English and Latin exercises, a servant\ntapped at the door, and, on its being opened, presented Madame Pelet's\ncompliments, and she would be happy to see me to take my \"gouter\" (a\nmeal which answers to our English \"tea\") with her in the dining-room.\n\n\"Plait-il?\" said I, for I thought I must have misunderstood, the\nmessage and invitation were so unusual; the same words were repeated. I\naccepted, of course, and as I descended the stairs, I wondered what\nwhim had entered the old lady's brain; her son was out--gone to pass the\nevening at the Salle of the Grande Harmonie or some other club of which\nhe was a member. Just as I laid my hand on the handle of the dining-room\ndoor, a queer idea glanced across my mind.\n\n\"Surely she's not going to make love to me,\" said I. \"I've heard of\nold Frenchwomen doing odd things in that line; and the gouter? They\ngenerally begin such affairs with eating and drinking, I believe.\"\n\nThere was a fearful dismay in this suggestion of my excited imagination,\nand if I had allowed myself time to dwell upon it, I should no doubt\nhave cut there and then, rushed back to my chamber, and bolted myself\nin; but whenever a danger or a horror is veiled with uncertainty,\nthe primary wish of the mind is to ascertain first the naked truth,\nreserving the expedient of flight for the moment when its dread\nanticipation shall be realized. I turned the door-handle, and in an\ninstant had crossed the fatal threshold, closed the door behind me, and\nstood in the presence of Madame Pelet.\n\nGracious heavens! The first view of her seemed to confirm my worst\napprehensions. There she sat, dressed out in a light green muslin gown,\non her head a lace cap with flourishing red roses in the frill; her\ntable was carefully spread; there were fruit, cakes, and coffee, with a\nbottle of something--I did not know what. Already the cold sweat started\non my brow, already I glanced back over my shoulder at the closed\ndoor, when, to my unspeakable relief, my eye, wandering mildly in the\ndirection of the stove, rested upon a second figure, seated in a large\nfauteuil beside it. This was a woman, too, and, moreover, an old woman,\nand as fat and as rubicund as Madame Pelet was meagre and yellow; her\nattire was likewise very fine, and spring flowers of different hues\ncircled in a bright wreath the crown of her violet-coloured velvet\nbonnet.\n\nI had only time to make these general observations when Madame Pelet,\ncoming forward with what she intended should be a graceful and elastic\nstep, thus accosted me:\n\n\"Monsieur is indeed most obliging to quit his books, his studies, at the\nrequest of an insignificant person like me--will Monsieur complete his\nkindness by allowing me to present him to my dear friend Madame Reuter,\nwho resides in the neighbouring house--the young ladies' school.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought I, \"I knew she was old,\" and I bowed and took my seat.\nMadame Reuter placed herself at the table opposite to me.\n\n\"How do you like Belgium, Monsieur?\" asked she, in an accent of the\nbroadest Bruxellois. I could now well distinguish the difference between\nthe fine and pure Parisian utterance of M. Pelet, for instance, and\nthe guttural enunciation of the Flamands. I answered politely, and then\nwondered how so coarse and clumsy an old woman as the one before me\nshould be at the head of a ladies' seminary, which I had always heard\nspoken of in terms of high commendation. In truth there was something\nto wonder at. Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous, free-living old\nFlemish fermiere, or even a maitresse d'auberge, than a staid, grave,\nrigid directrice de pensionnat. In general the continental, or at least\nthe Belgian old women permit themselves a licence of manners, speech,\nand aspect, such as our venerable granddames would recoil from as\nabsolutely disreputable, and Madame Reuter's jolly face bore evidence\nthat she was no exception to the rule of her country; there was a\ntwinkle and leer in her left eye; her right she kept habitually half\nshut, which I thought very odd indeed. After several vain attempts to\ncomprehend the motives of these two droll old creatures for inviting me\nto join them at their gouter, I at last fairly gave it up, and resigning\nmyself to inevitable mystification, I sat and looked first at one, then\nat the other, taking care meantime to do justice to the confitures,\ncakes, and coffee, with which they amply supplied me. They, too, ate,\nand that with no delicate appetite, and having demolished a large\nportion of the solids, they proposed a \"petit verre.\" I declined. Not\nso Mesdames Pelet and Reuter; each mixed herself what I thought rather\na stiff tumbler of punch, and placing it on a stand near the stove, they\ndrew up their chairs to that convenience, and invited me to do the same.\nI obeyed; and being seated fairly between them, I was thus addressed\nfirst by Madame Pelet, then by Madame Reuter.\n\n\"We will now speak of business,\" said Madame Pelet, and she went on to\nmake an elaborate speech, which, being interpreted, was to the effect\nthat she had asked for the pleasure of my company that evening in\norder to give her friend Madame Reuter an opportunity of broaching an\nimportant proposal, which might turn out greatly to my advantage.\n\n\"Pourvu que vous soyez sage,\" said Madame Reuter, \"et a vrai dire,\nvous en avez bien l'air. Take one drop of the punch\" (or ponche, as she\npronounced it); \"it is an agreeable and wholesome beverage after a full\nmeal.\"\n\nI bowed, but again declined it. She went on:\n\n\"I feel,\" said she, after a solemn sip--\"I feel profoundly the\nimportance of the commission with which my dear daughter has entrusted\nme, for you are aware, Monsieur, that it is my daughter who directs the\nestablishment in the next house?\"\n\n\"Ah! I thought it was yourself, madame.\" Though, indeed, at that moment\nI recollected that it was called Mademoiselle, not Madame Reuter's\npensionnat.\n\n\"I! Oh, no! I manage the house and look after the servants, as my friend\nMadame Pelet does for Monsieur her son--nothing more. Ah! you thought I\ngave lessons in class--did you?\"\n\nAnd she laughed loud and long, as though the idea tickled her fancy\namazingly.\n\n\"Madame is in the wrong to laugh,\" I observed; \"if she does not give\nlessons, I am sure it is not because she cannot;\" and I whipped out a\nwhite pocket-handkerchief and wafted it, with a French grace, past my\nnose, bowing at the same time.\n\n\"Quel charmant jeune homme!\" murmured Madame Pelet in a low voice.\nMadame Reuter, being less sentimental, as she was Flamand and not\nFrench, only laughed again.\n\n\"You are a dangerous person, I fear,\" said she; \"if you can forge\ncompliments at that rate, Zoraide will positively be afraid of you; but\nif you are good, I will keep your secret, and not tell her how well you\ncan flatter. Now, listen what sort of a proposal she makes to you. She\nhas heard that you are an excellent professor, and as she wishes to get\nthe very best masters for her school (car Zoraide fait tout comme une\nreine, c'est une veritable maitresse-femme), she has commissioned me to\nstep over this afternoon, and sound Madame Pelet as to the possibility\nof engaging you. Zoraide is a wary general; she never advances without\nfirst examining well her ground. I don't think she would be pleased\nif she knew I had already disclosed her intentions to you; she did not\norder me to go so far, but I thought there would be no harm in letting\nyou into the secret, and Madame Pelet was of the same opinion. Take\ncare, however, you don't betray either of us to Zoraide--to my\ndaughter, I mean; she is so discreet and circumspect herself, she cannot\nunderstand that one should find a pleasure in gossiping a little--\"\n\n\"C'est absolument comme mon fils!\" cried Madame Pelet.\n\n\"All the world is so changed since our girlhood!\" rejoined the other:\n\"young people have such old heads now. But to return, Monsieur. Madame\nPelet will mention the subject of your giving lessons in my daughter's\nestablishment to her son, and he will speak to you; and then to-morrow,\nyou will step over to our house, and ask to see my daughter, and you\nwill introduce the subject as if the first intimation of it had reached\nyou from M. Pelet himself, and be sure you never mention my name, for I\nwould not displease Zoraide on any account.\"\n\n\"Bien! bien!\" interrupted I--for all this chatter and circumlocution\nbegan to bore me very much; \"I will consult M. Pelet, and the thing\nshall be settled as you desire. Good evening, mesdames--I am infinitely\nobliged to you.\"\n\n\"Comment! vous vous en allez deja?\" exclaimed Madame Pelet.\n\n\"Prenez encore quelquechose, monsieur; une pomme cuite, des biscuits,\nencore une tasse de cafe?\"\n\n\"Merci, merci, madame--au revoir.\" And I backed at last out of the\napartment.\n\nHaving regained my own room, I set myself to turn over in my mind\nthe incident of the evening. It seemed a queer affair altogether, and\nqueerly managed; the two old women had made quite a little intricate\nmess of it; still I found that the uppermost feeling in my mind on the\nsubject was one of satisfaction. In the first place it would be a change\nto give lessons in another seminary, and then to teach young ladies\nwould be an occupation so interesting--to be admitted at all into a\nladies' boarding-school would be an incident so new in my life. Besides,\nthought I, as I glanced at the boarded window, \"I shall now at last see\nthe mysterious garden: I shall gaze both on the angels and their Eden.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nM. PELET could not of course object to the proposal made by Mdlle.\nReuter; permission to accept such additional employment, should it\noffer, having formed an article of the terms on which he had engaged me.\nIt was, therefore, arranged in the course of next day that I should\nbe at liberty to give lessons in Mdlle. Reuter's establishment four\nafternoons in every week.\n\nWhen evening came I prepared to step over in order to seek a conference\nwith Mademoiselle herself on the subject; I had not had time to pay the\nvisit before, having been all day closely occupied in class. I remember\nvery well that before quitting my chamber, I held a brief debate with\nmyself as to whether I should change my ordinary attire for something\nsmarter. At last I concluded it would be a waste of labour. \"Doubtless,\"\nthought I, \"she is some stiff old maid; for though the daughter of\nMadame Reuter, she may well number upwards of forty winters; besides, if\nit were otherwise, if she be both young and pretty, I am not handsome,\nand no dressing can make me so, therefore I'll go as I am.\" And off\nI started, cursorily glancing sideways as I passed the toilet-table,\nsurmounted by a looking-glass: a thin irregular face I saw, with sunk,\ndark eyes under a large, square forehead, complexion destitute of bloom\nor attraction; something young, but not youthful, no object to win a\nlady's love, no butt for the shafts of Cupid.\n\nI was soon at the entrance of the pensionnat, in a moment I had pulled\nthe bell; in another moment the door was opened, and within appeared a\npassage paved alternately with black and white marble; the walls were\npainted in imitation of marble also; and at the far end opened a glass\ndoor, through which I saw shrubs and a grass-plat, looking pleasant in\nthe sunshine of the mild spring evening--for it was now the middle of\nApril.\n\nThis, then, was my first glimpse of the garden; but I had not time to\nlook long, the portress, after having answered in the affirmative\nmy question as to whether her mistress was at home, opened the\nfolding-doors of a room to the left, and having ushered me in, closed\nthem behind me. I found myself in a salon with a very well-painted,\nhighly varnished floor; chairs and sofas covered with white draperies,\na green porcelain stove, walls hung with pictures in gilt frames, a gilt\npendule and other ornaments on the mantelpiece, a large lustre pendent\nfrom the centre of the ceiling, mirrors, consoles, muslin curtains, and\na handsome centre table completed the inventory of furniture. All looked\nextremely clean and glittering, but the general effect would have been\nsomewhat chilling had not a second large pair of folding-doors, standing\nwide open, and disclosing another and smaller salon, more snugly\nfurnished, offered some relief to the eye. This room was carpeted, and\ntherein was a piano, a couch, a chiffonniere--above all, it contained\na lofty window with a crimson curtain, which, being undrawn, afforded\nanother glimpse of the garden, through the large, clear panes, round\nwhich some leaves of ivy, some tendrils of vine were trained.\n\n\"Monsieur Creemsvort, n'est ce pas?\" said a voice behind me; and,\nstarting involuntarily, I turned. I had been so taken up with the\ncontemplation of the pretty little salon that I had not noticed the\nentrance of a person into the larger room. It was, however, Mdlle.\nReuter who now addressed me, and stood close beside me; and when I had\nbowed with instantaneously recovered sang-froid--for I am not easily\nembarrassed--I commenced the conversation by remarking on the pleasant\naspect of her little cabinet, and the advantage she had over M. Pelet in\npossessing a garden.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"she often thought so;\" and added, \"it is my garden,\nmonsieur, which makes me retain this house, otherwise I should probably\nhave removed to larger and more commodious premises long since; but you\nsee I could not take my garden with me, and I should scarcely find one\nso large and pleasant anywhere else in town.\"\n\nI approved her judgment.\n\n\"But you have not seen it yet,\" said she, rising; \"come to the window\nand take a better view.\" I followed her; she opened the sash, and\nleaning out I saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been\nto me an unknown region. It was a long, not very broad strip of cultured\nground, with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit trees down the\nmiddle; there was a sort of lawn, a parterre of rose-trees, some\nflower-borders, and, on the far side, a thickly planted copse of lilacs,\nlaburnums, and acacias. It looked pleasant, to me--very pleasant, so\nlong a time had elapsed since I had seen a garden of any sort. But it\nwas not only on Mdlle. Reuter's garden that my eyes dwelt; when I had\ntaken a view of her well-trimmed beds and budding shrubberies, I allowed\nmy glance to come back to herself, nor did I hastily withdraw it.\n\nI had thought to see a tall, meagre, yellow, conventual image in black,\nwith a close white cap, bandaged under the chin like a nun's head-gear;\nwhereas, there stood by me a little and roundly formed woman, who might\nindeed be older than I, but was still young; she could not, I thought,\nbe more than six or seven and twenty; she was as fair as a fair\nEnglishwoman; she had no cap; her hair was nut-brown, and she wore it\nin curls; pretty her features were not, nor very soft, nor very regular,\nbut neither were they in any degree plain, and I already saw cause\nto deem them expressive. What was their predominant cast? Was it\nsagacity?--sense? Yes, I thought so; but I could scarcely as yet be\nsure. I discovered, however, that there was a certain serenity of eye,\nand freshness of complexion, most pleasing to behold. The colour on her\ncheek was like the bloom on a good apple, which is as sound at the core\nas it is red on the rind.\n\nMdlle. Reuter and I entered upon business. She said she was not\nabsolutely certain of the wisdom of the step she was about to take,\nbecause I was so young, and parents might possibly object to a professor\nlike me for their daughters: \"But it is often well to act on one's own\njudgment,\" said she, \"and to lead parents, rather than be led by them.\nThe fitness of a professor is not a matter of age; and, from what I have\nheard, and from what I observe myself, I would much rather trust you\nthan M. Ledru, the music-master, who is a married man of near fifty.\"\n\nI remarked that I hoped she would find me worthy of her good opinion;\nthat if I knew myself, I was incapable of betraying any confidence\nreposed in me. \"Du reste,\" said she, \"the surveillance will be strictly\nattended to.\" And then she proceeded to discuss the subject of terms.\nShe was very cautious, quite on her guard; she did not absolutely\nbargain, but she warily sounded me to find out what my expectations\nmight be; and when she could not get me to name a sum, she reasoned and\nreasoned with a fluent yet quiet circumlocution of speech, and at last\nnailed me down to five hundred francs per annum--not too much, but I\nagreed. Before the negotiation was completed, it began to grow a little\ndusk. I did not hasten it, for I liked well enough to sit and hear\nher talk; I was amused with the sort of business talent she displayed.\nEdward could not have shown himself more practical, though he might have\nevinced more coarseness and urgency; and then she had so many reasons,\nso many explanations; and, after all, she succeeded in proving herself\nquite disinterested and even liberal. At last she concluded, she could\nsay no more, because, as I acquiesced in all things, there was no\nfurther ground for the exercise of her parts of speech. I was obliged to\nrise. I would rather have sat a little longer; what had I to return to\nbut my small empty room? And my eyes had a pleasure in looking at\nMdlle. Reuter, especially now, when the twilight softened her features a\nlittle, and, in the doubtful dusk, I could fancy her forehead as open\nas it was really elevated, her mouth touched with turns of sweetness\nas well as defined in lines of sense. When I rose to go, I held out\nmy hand, on purpose, though I knew it was contrary to the etiquette of\nforeign habits; she smiled, and said--\n\n\"Ah! c'est comme tous les Anglais,\" but gave me her hand very kindly.\n\n\"It is the privilege of my country, Mademoiselle,\" said I; \"and,\nremember, I shall always claim it.\"\n\nShe laughed a little, quite good-naturedly, and with the sort of\ntranquillity obvious in all she did--a tranquillity which soothed and\nsuited me singularly, at least I thought so that evening. Brussels\nseemed a very pleasant place to me when I got out again into the street,\nand it appeared as if some cheerful, eventful, upward-tending career\nwere even then opening to me, on that selfsame mild, still April night.\nSo impressionable a being is man, or at least such a man as I was in\nthose days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nNEXT day the morning hours seemed to pass very slowly at M. Pelet's; I\nwanted the afternoon to come that I might go again to the neighbouring\npensionnat and give my first lesson within its pleasant precincts; for\npleasant they appeared to me. At noon the hour of recreation arrived; at\none o'clock we had lunch; this got on the time, and at last St. Gudule's\ndeep bell, tolling slowly two, marked the moment for which I had been\nwaiting.\n\nAt the foot of the narrow back-stairs that descended from my room, I met\nM. Pelet.\n\n\"Comme vous avez l'air rayonnant!\" said he. \"Je ne vous ai jamais vu\naussi gai. Que s'est-il donc passe?\"\n\n\"Apparemment que j'aime les changements,\" replied I.\n\n\"Ah! je comprends--c'est cela--soyez sage seulement. Vous etes bien\njeune--trop jeune pour le role que vous allez jouer; il faut prendre\ngarde--savez-vous?\"\n\n\"Mais quel danger y a-t-il?\"\n\n\"Je n'en sais rien--ne vous laissez pas aller a de vives\nimpressions--voila tout.\"\n\nI laughed: a sentiment of exquisite pleasure played over my nerves at\nthe thought that \"vives impressions\" were likely to be created; it was\nthe deadness, the sameness of life's daily ongoings that had hitherto\nbeen my bane; my blouse-clad \"eleves\" in the boys' seminary never\nstirred in me any \"vives impressions\" except it might be occasionally\nsome of anger. I broke from M. Pelet, and as I strode down the passage\nhe followed me with one of his laughs--a very French, rakish, mocking\nsound.\n\nAgain I stood at the neighbouring door, and soon was re-admitted into\nthe cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls.\nI followed the portress, and descending a step, and making a turn, I\nfound myself in a sort of corridor; a side-door opened, Mdlle. Reuter's\nlittle figure, as graceful as it was plump, appeared. I could now see\nher dress in full daylight; a neat, simple mousseline-laine gown fitted\nher compact round shape to perfection--delicate little collar and\nmanchettes of lace, trim Parisian brodequins showed her neck, wrists,\nand feet, to complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she\ncame suddenly upon me! Solicitude and business were in her eye--on her\nforehead; she looked almost stern. Her \"Bon jour, monsieur,\" was quite\npolite, but so orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp\ntowel over my \"vives impressions.\" The servant turned back when her\nmistress appeared, and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side\nwith Mdlle. Reuter.\n\n\"Monsieur will give a lesson in the first class to-day,\" said she;\n\"dictation or reading will perhaps be the best thing to begin with, for\nthose are the easiest forms of communicating instruction in a foreign\nlanguage; and, at the first, a master naturally feels a little\nunsettled.\"\n\nShe was quite right, as I had found from experience; it only remained\nfor me to acquiesce. We proceeded now in silence. The corridor\nterminated in a hall, large, lofty, and square; a glass door on one side\nshowed within a long narrow refectory, with tables, an armoire, and\ntwo lamps; it was empty; large glass doors, in front, opened on the\nplayground and garden; a broad staircase ascended spirally on the\nopposite side; the remaining wall showed a pair of great folding-doors,\nnow closed, and admitting, doubtless, to the classes.\n\nMdlle. Reuter turned her eye laterally on me, to ascertain, probably,\nwhether I was collected enough to be ushered into her sanctum sanctorum.\nI suppose she judged me to be in a tolerable state of self-government,\nfor she opened the door, and I followed her through. A rustling sound of\nuprising greeted our entrance; without looking to the right or left, I\nwalked straight up the lane between two sets of benches and desks,\nand took possession of the empty chair and isolated desk raised on an\nestrade, of one step high, so as to command one division; the other\ndivision being under the surveillance of a maitresse similarly elevated.\nAt the back of the estrade, and attached to a moveable partition\ndividing this schoolroom from another beyond, was a large tableau of\nwood painted black and varnished; a thick crayon of white chalk lay on\nmy desk for the convenience of elucidating any grammatical or verbal\nobscurity which might occur in my lessons by writing it upon the\ntableau; a wet sponge appeared beside the chalk, to enable me to efface\nthe marks when they had served the purpose intended.\n\nI carefully and deliberately made these observations before allowing\nmyself to take one glance at the benches before me; having handled the\ncrayon, looked back at the tableau, fingered the sponge in order to\nascertain that it was in a right state of moisture, I found myself cool\nenough to admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me.\n\nAnd first I observed that Mdlle. Reuter had already glided away, she\nwas nowhere visible; a maitresse or teacher, the one who occupied the\ncorresponding estrade to my own, alone remained to keep guard over me;\nshe was a little in the shade, and, with my short sight, I could only\nsee that she was of a thin bony figure and rather tallowy complexion,\nand that her attitude, as she sat, partook equally of listlessness and\naffectation. More obvious, more prominent, shone on by the full light of\nthe large window, were the occupants of the benches just before me, of\nwhom some were girls of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, some young women\nfrom eighteen (as it appeared to me) up to twenty; the most modest\nattire, the simplest fashion of wearing the hair, were apparent in all;\nand good features, ruddy, blooming complexions, large and brilliant\neyes, forms full, even to solidity, seemed to abound. I did not bear\nthe first view like a stoic; I was dazzled, my eyes fell, and in a voice\nsomewhat too low I murmured--\n\n\"Prenez vos cahiers de dictee, mesdemoiselles.\"\n\nNot so had I bid the boys at Pelet's take their reading-books. A\nrustle followed, and an opening of desks; behind the lifted lids which\nmomentarily screened the heads bent down to search for exercise-books, I\nheard tittering and whispers.\n\n\"Eulalie, je suis prete a pleuer de rire,\" observed one.\n\n\"Comme il a rougi en parlant!\"\n\n\"Oui, c'est un veritable blanc-bec.\"\n\n\"Tais-toi, Hortense--il nous ecoute.\"\n\nAnd now the lids sank and the heads reappeared; I had marked three, the\nwhisperers, and I did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as\nthey emerged from their temporary eclipse. It is astonishing what ease\nand courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me; the idea by\nwhich I had been awed was that the youthful beings before me, with their\ndark nun-like robes and softly braided hair, were a kind of half-angels.\nThe light titter, the giddy whisper, had already in some measure\nrelieved my mind of that fond and oppressive fancy.\n\nThe three I allude to were just in front, within half a yard of my\nestrade, and were among the most womanly-looking present. Their names\nI knew afterwards, and may as well mention now; they were Eulalie,\nHortense, Caroline. Eulalie was tall, and very finely shaped: she was\nfair, and her features were those of a Low Country Madonna; many a\n\"figure de Vierge\" have I seen in Dutch pictures exactly resembling\nhers; there were no angles in her shape or in her face, all was curve\nand roundness--neither thought, sentiment, nor passion disturbed by line\nor flush the equality of her pale, clear skin; her noble bust heaved\nwith her regular breathing, her eyes moved a little--by these evidences\nof life alone could I have distinguished her from some large handsome\nfigure moulded in wax. Hortense was of middle size and stout, her\nform was ungraceful, her face striking, more alive and brilliant than\nEulalie's, her hair was dark brown, her complexion richly coloured;\nthere were frolic and mischief in her eye: consistency and good sense\nshe might possess, but none of her features betokened those qualities.\n\nCaroline was little, though evidently full grown; raven-black hair,\nvery dark eyes, absolutely regular features, with a colourless olive\ncomplexion, clear as to the face and sallow about the neck, formed in\nher that assemblage of points whose union many persons regard as the\nperfection of beauty. How, with the tintless pallor of her skin and the\nclassic straightness of her lineaments, she managed to look sensual, I\ndon't know. I think her lips and eyes contrived the affair between\nthem, and the result left no uncertainty on the beholder's mind. She was\nsensual now, and in ten years' time she would be coarse--promise plain\nwas written in her face of much future folly.\n\nIf I looked at these girls with little scruple, they looked at me\nwith still less. Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine, and seemed to\nexpect, passively but securely, an impromptu tribute to her majestic\ncharms. Hortense regarded me boldly, and giggled at the same time, while\nshe said, with an air of impudent freedom--\n\n\"Dictez-nous quelquechose de facile pour commencer, monsieur.\"\n\nCaroline shook her loose ringlets of abundant but somewhat coarse hair\nover her rolling black eyes; parting her lips, as full as those of a\nhot-blooded Maroon, she showed her well-set teeth sparkling between\nthem, and treated me at the same time to a smile \"de sa facon.\"\nBeautiful as Pauline Borghese, she looked at the moment scarcely purer\nthan Lucrece de Borgia. Caroline was of noble family. I heard her\nlady-mother's character afterwards, and then I ceased to wonder at the\nprecocious accomplishments of the daughter. These three, I at once saw,\ndeemed themselves the queens of the school, and conceived that by their\nsplendour they threw all the rest into the shade. In less than five\nminutes they had thus revealed to me their characters, and in less than\nfive minutes I had buckled on a breast-plate of steely indifference, and\nlet down a visor of impassible austerity.\n\n\"Take your pens and commence writing,\" said I, in as dry and trite a\nvoice as if I had been addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co.\n\nThe dictee now commenced. My three belles interrupted me perpetually\nwith little silly questions and uncalled-for remarks, to some of which I\nmade no answer, and to others replied very quietly and briefly. \"Comment\ndit-on point et virgule en Anglais, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Semi-colon, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Semi-collong? Ah, comme c'est drole!\" (giggle.)\n\n\"J'ai une si mauvaise plume--impossible d'ecrire!\"\n\n\"Mais, monsieur--je ne sais pas suivre--vous allez si vite.\"\n\n\"Je n'ai rien compris, moi!\"\n\nHere a general murmur arose, and the teacher, opening her lips for the\nfirst time, ejaculated--\n\n\"Silence, mesdemoiselles!\"\n\nNo silence followed--on the contrary, the three ladies in front began to\ntalk more loudly.\n\n\"C'est si difficile, l'Anglais!\"\n\n\"Je deteste la dictee.\"\n\n\"Quel ennui d'ecrire quelquechose que l'on ne comprend pas!\"\n\nSome of those behind laughed: a degree of confusion began to pervade the\nclass; it was necessary to take prompt measures.\n\n\"Donnez-moi votre cahier,\" said I to Eulalie in an abrupt tone; and\nbending over, I took it before she had time to give it.\n\n\"Et vous, mademoiselle--donnez-moi le votre,\" continued I, more mildly,\naddressing a little pale, plain looking girl who sat in the first row of\nthe other division, and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest\nand the most attentive in the room; she rose up, walked over to me, and\ndelivered her book with a grave, modest curtsey. I glanced over the\ntwo dictations; Eulalie's was slurred, blotted, and full of silly\nmistakes--Sylvie's (such was the name of the ugly little girl) was\nclearly written, it contained no error against sense, and but few\nfaults of orthography. I coolly read aloud both exercises, marking the\nfaults--then I looked at Eulalie:\n\n\"C'est honteux!\" said I, and I deliberately tore her dictation in four\nparts, and presented her with the fragments. I returned Sylvie her book\nwith a smile, saying--\n\n\"C'est bien--je suis content de vous.\"\n\nSylvie looked calmly pleased, Eulalie swelled like an incensed turkey,\nbut the mutiny was quelled: the conceited coquetry and futile flirtation\nof the first bench were exchanged for a taciturn sullenness, much more\nconvenient to me, and the rest of my lesson passed without interruption.\n\nA bell clanging out in the yard announced the moment for the cessation\nof school labours. I heard our own bell at the same time, and that of a\ncertain public college immediately after. Order dissolved instantly; up\nstarted every pupil, I hastened to seize my hat, bow to the maitresse,\nand quit the room before the tide of externats should pour from the\ninner class, where I knew near a hundred were prisoned, and whose rising\ntumult I already heard.\n\nI had scarcely crossed the hall and gained the corridor, when Mdlle.\nReuter came again upon me.\n\n\"Step in here a moment,\" said she, and she held open the door of\nthe side room from whence she had issued on my arrival; it was a\nSALLE-A-MANGER, as appeared from the beaufet and the armoire vitree,\nfilled with glass and china, which formed part of its furniture. Ere she\nhad closed the door on me and herself, the corridor was already filled\nwith day-pupils, tearing down their cloaks, bonnets, and cabas from\nthe wooden pegs on which they were suspended; the shrill voice of a\nmaitresse was heard at intervals vainly endeavouring to enforce some\nsort of order; vainly, I say: discipline there was none in these rough\nranks, and yet this was considered one of the best-conducted schools in\nBrussels.\n\n\"Well, you have given your first lesson,\" began Mdlle. Reuter in the\nmost calm, equable voice, as though quite unconscious of the chaos from\nwhich we were separated only by a single wall.\n\n\"Were you satisfied with your pupils, or did any circumstance in their\nconduct give you cause for complaint? Conceal nothing from me, repose in\nme entire confidence.\"\n\nHappily, I felt in myself complete power to manage my pupils without\naid; the enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity\nat first, had been a good deal dissipated. I cannot say I was chagrined\nor downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de\ndemoiselles presented to my vague ideal of the same community; I was\nonly enlightened and amused; consequently, I felt in no disposition to\ncomplain to Mdlle. Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to\nconfidence with a smile.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, mademoiselle, all has gone very smoothly.\"\n\nShe looked more than doubtful.\n\n\"Et les trois demoiselles du premier banc?\" said she.\n\n\"Ah! tout va au mieux!\" was my answer, and Mdlle. Reuter ceased to\nquestion me; but her eye--not large, not brilliant, not melting, or\nkindling, but astute, penetrating, practical, showed she was even with\nme; it let out a momentary gleam, which said plainly, \"Be as close as\nyou like, I am not dependent on your candour; what you would conceal I\nalready know.\"\n\nBy a transition so quiet as to be scarcely perceptible, the directress's\nmanner changed; the anxious business-air passed from her face, and she\nbegan chatting about the weather and the town, and asking in neighbourly\nwise after M. and Madame Pelet. I answered all her little questions; she\nprolonged her talk, I went on following its many little windings; she\nsat so long, said so much, varied so often the topics of discourse,\nthat it was not difficult to perceive she had a particular aim in thus\ndetaining me. Her mere words could have afforded no clue to this\naim, but her countenance aided; while her lips uttered only affable\ncommonplaces, her eyes reverted continually to my face. Her glances were\nnot given in full, but out of the corners, so quietly, so stealthily,\nyet I think I lost not one. I watched her as keenly as she watched me;\nI perceived soon that she was feeling after my real character; she was\nsearching for salient points, and weak points, and eccentric points;\nshe was applying now this test, now that, hoping in the end to find some\nchink, some niche, where she could put in her little firm foot and stand\nupon my neck--mistress of my nature. Do not mistake me, reader, it was\nno amorous influence she wished to gain--at that time it was only the\npower of the politician to which she aspired; I was now installed as a\nprofessor in her establishment, and she wanted to know where her mind\nwas superior to mine--by what feeling or opinion she could lead me.\n\nI enjoyed the game much, and did not hasten its conclusion; sometimes I\ngave her hopes, beginning a sentence rather weakly, when her shrewd eye\nwould light up--she thought she had me; having led her a little way, I\ndelighted to turn round and finish with sound, hard sense, whereat her\ncountenance would fall. At last a servant entered to announce dinner;\nthe conflict being thus necessarily terminated, we parted without having\ngained any advantage on either side: Mdlle. Reuter had not even given\nme an opportunity of attacking her with feeling, and I had managed to\nbaffle her little schemes of craft. It was a regular drawn battle. I\nagain held out my hand when I left the room, she gave me hers; it was a\nsmall and white hand, but how cool! I met her eye too in full--obliging\nher to give me a straightforward look; this last test went against\nme: it left her as it found her--moderate, temperate, tranquil; me it\ndisappointed.\n\n\"I am growing wiser,\" thought I, as I walked back to M. Pelet's. \"Look\nat this little woman; is she like the women of novelists and romancers?\nTo read of female character as depicted in Poetry and Fiction, one would\nthink it was made up of sentiment, either for good or bad--here is\na specimen, and a most sensible and respectable specimen, too, whose\nstaple ingredient is abstract reason. No Talleyrand was ever more\npassionless than Zoraide Reuter!\" So I thought then; I found\nafterwards that blunt susceptibilities are very consistent with strong\npropensities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nI HAD indeed had a very long talk with the crafty little politician, and\non regaining my quarters, I found that dinner was half over. To be late\nat meals was against a standing rule of the establishment, and had it\nbeen one of the Flemish ushers who thus entered after the removal of the\nsoup and the commencement of the first course, M. Pelet would probably\nhave greeted him with a public rebuke, and would certainly have mulcted\nhim both of soup and fish; as it was, that polite though partial\ngentleman only shook his head, and as I took my place, unrolled my\nnapkin, and said my heretical grace to myself, he civilly despatched a\nservant to the kitchen, to bring me a plate of \"puree aux carottes\"\n(for this was a maigre-day), and before sending away the first course,\nreserved for me a portion of the stock-fish of which it consisted.\nDinner being over, the boys rushed out for their evening play; Kint and\nVandam (the two ushers) of course followed them. Poor fellows! if they\nhad not looked so very heavy, so very soulless, so very indifferent to\nall things in heaven above or in the earth beneath, I could have pitied\nthem greatly for the obligation they were under to trail after those\nrough lads everywhere and at all times; even as it was, I felt disposed\nto scout myself as a privileged prig when I turned to ascend to my\nchamber, sure to find there, if not enjoyment, at least liberty; but\nthis evening (as had often happened before) I was to be still farther\ndistinguished.\n\n\"Eh bien, mauvais sujet!\" said the voice of M. Pelet behind me, as I\nset my foot on the first step of the stair, \"ou allez-vous? Venez a la\nsalle-a-manger, que je vous gronde un peu.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon, monsieur,\" said I, as I followed him to his private\nsitting-room, \"for having returned so late--it was not my fault.\"\n\n\"That is just what I want to know,\" rejoined M. Pelet, as he ushered me\ninto the comfortable parlour with a good wood-fire--for the stove had\nnow been removed for the season. Having rung the bell he ordered \"Coffee\nfor two,\" and presently he and I were seated, almost in English comfort,\none on each side of the hearth, a little round table between us, with\na coffee-pot, a sugar-basin, and two large white china cups. While\nM. Pelet employed himself in choosing a cigar from a box, my thoughts\nreverted to the two outcast ushers, whose voices I could hear even now\ncrying hoarsely for order in the playground.\n\n\"C'est une grande responsabilite, que la surveillance,\" observed I.\n\n\"Plait-il?\" dit M. Pelet.\n\nI remarked that I thought Messieurs Vandam and Kint must sometimes be a\nlittle fatigued with their labours.\n\n\"Des betes de somme,--des betes de somme,\" murmured scornfully the\ndirector. Meantime I offered him his cup of coffee.\n\n\"Servez-vous mon garcon,\" said he blandly, when I had put a couple of\nhuge lumps of continental sugar into his cup. \"And now tell me why you\nstayed so long at Mdlle. Reuter's. I know that lessons conclude, in her\nestablishment as in mine, at four o'clock, and when you returned it was\npast five.\"\n\n\"Mdlle. wished to speak with me, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Indeed! on what subject? if one may ask.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle talked about nothing, monsieur.\"\n\n\"A fertile topic! and did she discourse thereon in the schoolroom,\nbefore the pupils?\"\n\n\"No; like you, monsieur, she asked me to walk into her parlour.\"\n\n\"And Madame Reuter--the old duenna--my mother's gossip, was there, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I had the honour of being quite alone with mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"C'est joli--cela,\" observed M. Pelet, and he smiled and looked into the\nfire.\n\n\"Honi soit qui mal y pense,\" murmured I, significantly.\n\n\"Je connais un peu ma petite voisine--voyez-vous.\"\n\n\"In that case, monsieur will be able to aid me in finding out what was\nmademoiselle's reason for making me sit before her sofa one mortal hour,\nlistening to the most copious and fluent dissertation on the merest\nfrivolities.\"\n\n\"She was sounding your character.\"\n\n\"I thought so, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Did she find out your weak point?\"\n\n\"What is my weak point?\"\n\n\"Why, the sentimental. Any woman sinking her shaft deep enough, will\nat last reach a fathomless spring of sensibility in thy breast,\nCrimsworth.\"\n\nI felt the blood stir about my heart and rise warm to my cheek.\n\n\"Some women might, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is Mdlle. Reuter of the number? Come, speak frankly, mon fils; elle est\nencore jeune, plus agee que toi peut-etre, mais juste assey pour unir\nla tendresse d'une petite maman a l'amour d'une epouse devouee; n'est-ce\npas que cela t'irait superieurement?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I should like my wife to be my wife, and not half my\nmother.\"\n\n\"She is then a little too old for you?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, not a day too old if she suited me in other things.\"\n\n\"In what does she not suit you, William? She is personally agreeable, is\nshe not?\"\n\n\"Very; her hair and complexion are just what I admire; and her turn of\nform, though quite Belgian, is full of grace.\"\n\n\"Bravo! and her face? her features? How do you like them?\"\n\n\"A little harsh, especially her mouth.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! her mouth,\" said M. Pelet, and he chuckled inwardly. \"There is\ncharacter about her mouth--firmness--but she has a very pleasant smile;\ndon't you think so?\"\n\n\"Rather crafty.\"\n\n\"True, but that expression of craft is owing to her eyebrows; have you\nremarked her eyebrows?\"\n\nI answered that I had not.\n\n\"You have not seen her looking down then?\" said he.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It is a treat, notwithstanding. Observe her when she has some knitting,\nor some other woman's work in hand, and sits the image of peace, calmly\nintent on her needles and her silk, some discussion meantime going on\naround her, in the course of which peculiarities of character are being\ndeveloped, or important interests canvassed; she takes no part in it;\nher humble, feminine mind is wholly with her knitting; none of her\nfeatures move; she neither presumes to smile approval, nor frown\ndisapprobation; her little hands assiduously ply their unpretending\ntask; if she can only get this purse finished, or this bonnet-grec\ncompleted, it is enough for her. If gentlemen approach her chair, a\ndeeper quiescence, a meeker modesty settles on her features, and clothes\nher general mien; observe then her eyebrows, et dites-moi s'il n'y a pas\ndu chat dans l'un et du renard dans l'autre.\"\n\n\"I will take careful notice the first opportunity,\" said I.\n\n\"And then,\" continued M. Pelet, \"the eyelid will flicker, the\nlight-coloured lashes be lifted a second, and a blue eye, glancing out\nfrom under the screen, will take its brief, sly, searching survey, and\nretreat again.\"\n\nI smiled, and so did Pelet, and after a few minutes' silence, I asked:\n\n\"Will she ever marry, do you think?\"\n\n\"Marry! Will birds pair? Of course it is both her intention and\nresolution to marry when she finds a suitable match, and no one is\nbetter aware than herself of the sort of impression she is capable\nof producing; no one likes better to captivate in a quiet way. I am\nmistaken if she will not yet leave the print of her stealing steps on\nthy heart, Crimsworth.\"\n\n\"Of her steps? Confound it, no! My heart is not a plank to be walked\non.\"\n\n\"But the soft touch of a patte de velours will do it no harm.\"\n\n\"She offers me no patte de velours; she is all form and reserve with\nme.\"\n\n\"That to begin with; let respect be the foundation, affection the first\nfloor, love the superstructure; Mdlle. Reuter is a skilful architect.\"\n\n\"And interest, M. Pelet--interest. Will not mademoiselle consider that\npoint?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, no doubt; it will be the cement between every stone. And now\nwe have discussed the directress, what of the pupils? N'y a-t-il pas de\nbelles etudes parmi ces jeunes tetes?\"\n\n\"Studies of character? Yes; curious ones, at least, I imagine; but one\ncannot divine much from a first interview.\"\n\n\"Ah, you affect discretion; but tell me now, were you not a little\nabashed before these blooming young creatures?\"\n\n\"At first, yes; but I rallied and got through with all due sang-froid.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"It is true, notwithstanding. At first I thought them angels, but they\ndid not leave me long under that delusion; three of the eldest and\nhandsomest undertook the task of setting me right, and they managed\nso cleverly that in five minutes I knew them, at least, for what they\nwere--three arrant coquettes.\"\n\n\"Je les connais!\" exclaimed M. Pelet. \"Elles sont toujours au premier\nrang a l'eglise et a la promenade; une blonde superbe, une jolie\nespiegle, une belle brune.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Lovely creatures all of them--heads for artists; what a group they\nwould make, taken together! Eulalie (I know their names), with her\nsmooth braided hair and calm ivory brow. Hortense, with her rich chesnut\nlocks so luxuriantly knotted, plaited, twisted, as if she did not know\nhow to dispose of all their abundance, with her vermilion lips, damask\ncheek, and roguish laughing eye. And Caroline de Blemont! Ah, there is\nbeauty! beauty in perfection. What a cloud of sable curls about the face\nof a houri! What fascinating lips! What glorious black eyes! Your Byron\nwould have worshipped her, and you--you cold, frigid islander!--you\nplayed the austere, the insensible in the presence of an Aphrodite so\nexquisite?\"\n\nI might have laughed at the director's enthusiasm had I believed\nit real, but there was something in his tone which indicated got-up\nraptures. I felt he was only affecting fervour in order to put me off my\nguard, to induce me to come out in return, so I scarcely even smiled. He\nwent on:\n\n\"Confess, William, do not the mere good looks of Zoraide Reuter appear\ndowdyish and commonplace compared with the splendid charms of some of\nher pupils?\"\n\nThe question discomposed me, but I now felt plainly that my principal\nwas endeavouring (for reasons best known to himself--at that time I\ncould not fathom them) to excite ideas and wishes in my mind alien to\nwhat was right and honourable. The iniquity of the instigation proved\nits antidote, and when he further added:--\n\n\"Each of those three beautiful girls will have a handsome fortune; and\nwith a little address, a gentlemanlike, intelligent young fellow like\nyou might make himself master of the hand, heart, and purse of any one\nof the trio.\"\n\nI replied by a look and an interrogative \"Monsieur?\" which startled him.\n\nHe laughed a forced laugh, affirmed that he had only been joking, and\ndemanded whether I could possibly have thought him in earnest. Just then\nthe bell rang; the play-hour was over; it was an evening on which M.\nPelet was accustomed to read passages from the drama and the belles\nlettres to his pupils. He did not wait for my answer, but rising, left\nthe room, humming as he went some gay strain of Beranger's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nDAILY, as I continued my attendance at the seminary of Mdlle. Reuter,\ndid I find fresh occasions to compare the ideal with the real. What\nhad I known of female character previously to my arrival at Brussels?\nPrecious little. And what was my notion of it? Something vague, slight,\ngauzy, glittering; now when I came in contact with it I found it to be\na palpable substance enough; very hard too sometimes, and often heavy;\nthere was metal in it, both lead and iron.\n\nLet the idealists, the dreamers about earthly angel and human flowers,\njust look here while I open my portfolio and show them a sketch or\ntwo, pencilled after nature. I took these sketches in the second-class\nschoolroom of Mdlle. Reuter's establishment, where about a hundred\nspecimens of the genus \"jeune fille\" collected together offered a\nfertile variety of subject. A miscellaneous assortment they were,\ndiffering both in caste and country; as I sat on my estrade and glanced\nover the long range of desks, I had under my eye French, English,\nBelgians, Austrians, and Prussians. The majority belonged to the class\nbourgeois; but there were many countesses, there were the daughters of\ntwo generals and of several colonels, captains, and government EMPLOYES;\nthese ladies sat side by side with young females destined to be\ndemoiselles de magasins, and with some Flamandes, genuine aborigines of\nthe country. In dress all were nearly similar, and in manners there was\nsmall difference; exceptions there were to the general rule, but the\nmajority gave the tone to the establishment, and that tone was rough,\nboisterous, masked by a point-blank disregard of all forbearance towards\neach other or their teachers; an eager pursuit by each individual of her\nown interest and convenience; and a coarse indifference to the interest\nand convenience of every one else. Most of them could lie with audacity\nwhen it appeared advantageous to do so. All understood the art of\nspeaking fair when a point was to be gained, and could with consummate\nskill and at a moment's notice turn the cold shoulder the instant\ncivility ceased to be profitable. Very little open quarrelling ever took\nplace amongst them; but backbiting and talebearing were universal. Close\nfriendships were forbidden by the rules of the school, and no one girl\nseemed to cultivate more regard for another than was just necessary to\nsecure a companion when solitude would have been irksome. They were each\nand all supposed to have been reared in utter unconsciousness of vice.\nThe precautions used to keep them ignorant, if not innocent, were\ninnumerable. How was it, then, that scarcely one of those girls having\nattained the age of fourteen could look a man in the face with modesty\nand propriety? An air of bold, impudent flirtation, or a loose, silly\nleer, was sure to answer the most ordinary glance from a masculine eye.\nI know nothing of the arcana of the Roman Catholic religion, and I\nam not a bigot in matters of theology, but I suspect the root of this\nprecocious impurity, so obvious, so general in Popish countries, is to\nbe found in the discipline, if not the doctrines of the Church of Rome.\nI record what I have seen: these girls belonged to what are called the\nrespectable ranks of society; they had all been carefully brought up,\nyet was the mass of them mentally depraved. So much for the general\nview: now for one or two selected specimens.\n\nThe first picture is a full length of Aurelia Koslow, a German fraulein,\nor rather a half-breed between German and Russian. She is eighteen years\nof age, and has been sent to Brussels to finish her education; she is\nof middle size, stiffly made, body long, legs short, bust much developed\nbut not compactly moulded, waist disproportionately compressed by an\ninhumanly braced corset, dress carefully arranged, large feet tortured\ninto small bottines, head small, hair smoothed, braided, oiled, and\ngummed to perfection; very low forehead, very diminutive and vindictive\ngrey eyes, somewhat Tartar features, rather flat nose, rather high-cheek\nbones, yet the ensemble not positively ugly; tolerably good complexion.\nSo much for person. As to mind, deplorably ignorant and ill-informed:\nincapable of writing or speaking correctly even German, her native\ntongue, a dunce in French, and her attempts at learning English a mere\nfarce, yet she has been at school twelve years; but as she invariably\ngets her exercises, of every description, done by a fellow pupil, and\nreads her lessons off a book concealed in her lap, it is not wonderful\nthat her progress has been so snail-like. I do not know what Aurelia's\ndaily habits of life are, because I have not the opportunity of\nobserving her at all times; but from what I see of the state of her\ndesk, books, and papers, I should say she is slovenly and even dirty;\nher outward dress, as I have said, is well attended to, but in passing\nbehind her bench, I have remarked that her neck is gray for want of\nwashing, and her hair, so glossy with gum and grease, is not such as\none feels tempted to pass the hand over, much less to run the fingers\nthrough. Aurelia's conduct in class, at least when I am present, is\nsomething extraordinary, considered as an index of girlish innocence.\nThe moment I enter the room, she nudges her next neighbour and indulges\nin a half-suppressed laugh. As I take my seat on the estrade, she\nfixes her eye on me; she seems resolved to attract, and, if possible,\nmonopolize my notice: to this end she launches at me all sorts of looks,\nlanguishing, provoking, leering, laughing. As I am found quite proof\nagainst this sort of artillery--for we scorn what, unasked, is lavishly\noffered--she has recourse to the expedient of making noises; sometimes\nshe sighs, sometimes groans, sometimes utters inarticulate sounds, for\nwhich language has no name. If, in walking up the schoolroom, I pass\nnear her, she puts out her foot that it may touch mine; if I do not\nhappen to observe the manoeuvre, and my boot comes in contact with her\nbrodequin, she affects to fall into convulsions of suppressed laughter;\nif I notice the snare and avoid it, she expresses her mortification in\nsullen muttering, where I hear myself abused in bad French, pronounced\nwith an intolerable Low German accent.\n\nNot far from Mdlle. Koslow sits another young lady by name Adele\nDronsart: this is a Belgian, rather low of stature, in form heavy,\nwith broad waist, short neck and limbs, good red and white complexion,\nfeatures well chiselled and regular, well-cut eyes of a clear brown\ncolour, light brown hair, good teeth, age not much above fifteen, but as\nfull-grown as a stout young Englishwoman of twenty. This portrait gives\nthe idea of a somewhat dumpy but good-looking damsel, does it not? Well,\nwhen I looked along the row of young heads, my eye generally stopped at\nthis of Adele's; her gaze was ever waiting for mine, and it frequently\nsucceeded in arresting it. She was an unnatural-looking being--so young,\nfresh, blooming, yet so Gorgon-like. Suspicion, sullen ill-temper were\non her forehead, vicious propensities in her eye, envy and panther-like\ndeceit about her mouth. In general she sat very still; her massive shape\nlooked as if it could not bend much, nor did her large head--so broad\nat the base, so narrow towards the top--seem made to turn readily on her\nshort neck. She had but two varieties of expression; the prevalent one\na forbidding, dissatisfied scowl, varied sometimes by a most pernicious\nand perfidious smile. She was shunned by her fellow-pupils, for, bad as\nmany of them were, few were as bad as she.\n\nAurelia and Adele were in the first division of the second class; the\nsecond division was headed by a pensionnaire named Juanna Trista. This\ngirl was of mixed Belgian and Spanish origin; her Flemish mother was\ndead, her Catalonian father was a merchant residing in the ---- Isles,\nwhere Juanna had been born and whence she was sent to Europe to be\neducated. I wonder that any one, looking at that girl's head and\ncountenance, would have received her under their roof. She had precisely\nthe same shape of skull as Pope Alexander the Sixth; her organs\nof benevolence, veneration, conscientiousness, adhesiveness, were\nsingularly small, those of self-esteem, firmness, destructiveness,\ncombativeness, preposterously large; her head sloped up in the penthouse\nshape, was contracted about the forehead, and prominent behind; she\nhad rather good, though large and marked features; her temperament was\nfibrous and bilious, her complexion pale and dark, hair and eyes black,\nform angular and rigid but proportionate, age fifteen.\n\nJuanna was not very thin, but she had a gaunt visage, and her \"regard\"\nwas fierce and hungry; narrow as was her brow, it presented space enough\nfor the legible graving of two words, Mutiny and Hate; in some one of\nher other lineaments I think the eye--cowardice had also its distinct\ncipher. Mdlle. Trista thought fit to trouble my first lessons with a\ncoarse work-day sort of turbulence; she made noises with her mouth like\na horse, she ejected her saliva, she uttered brutal expressions; behind\nand below her were seated a band of very vulgar, inferior-looking\nFlamandes, including two or three examples of that deformity of person\nand imbecility of intellect whose frequency in the Low Countries would\nseem to furnish proof that the climate is such as to induce degeneracy\nof the human mind and body; these, I soon found, were completely under\nher influence, and with their aid she got up and sustained a swinish\ntumult, which I was constrained at last to quell by ordering her and two\nof her tools to rise from their seats, and, having kept them standing\nfive minutes, turning them bodily out of the schoolroom: the accomplices\ninto a large place adjoining called the grands salle; the principal\ninto a cabinet, of which I closed the door and pocketed the key. This\njudgment I executed in the presence of Mdlle. Reuter, who looked much\naghast at beholding so decided a proceeding--the most severe that had\never been ventured on in her establishment. Her look of affright I\nanswered with one of composure, and finally with a smile, which perhaps\nflattered, and certainly soothed her. Juanna Trista remained in Europe\nlong enough to repay, by malevolence and ingratitude, all who had ever\ndone her a good turn; and she then went to join her father in the----\nIsles, exulting in the thought that she should there have slaves, whom,\nas she said, she could kick and strike at will.\n\nThese three pictures are from the life. I possess others, as marked and\nas little agreeable, but I will spare my reader the exhibition of them.\n\nDoubtless it will be thought that I ought now, by way of contrast, to\nshow something charming; some gentle virgin head, circled with a halo,\nsome sweet personification of innocence, clasping the dove of peace to\nher bosom. No: I saw nothing of the sort, and therefore cannot portray\nit. The pupil in the school possessing the happiest disposition was\na young girl from the country, Louise Path; she was sufficiently\nbenevolent and obliging, but not well taught nor well mannered;\nmoreover, the plague-spot of dissimulation was in her also; honour and\nprinciple were unknown to her, she had scarcely heard their names. The\nleast exceptionable pupil was the poor little Sylvie I have mentioned\nonce before. Sylvie was gentle in manners, intelligent in mind; she was\neven sincere, as far as her religion would permit her to be so, but her\nphysical organization was defective; weak health stunted her growth and\nchilled her spirits, and then, destined as she was for the cloister,\nher whole soul was warped to a conventual bias, and in the tame, trained\nsubjection of her manner, one read that she had already prepared herself\nfor her future course of life, by giving up her independence of thought\nand action into the hands of some despotic confessor. She permitted\nherself no original opinion, no preference of companion or employment;\nin everything she was guided by another. With a pale, passive, automaton\nair, she went about all day long doing what she was bid; never what she\nliked, or what, from innate conviction, she thought it right to do. The\npoor little future religieuse had been early taught to make the dictates\nof her own reason and conscience quite subordinate to the will of\nher spiritual director. She was the model pupil of Mdlle. Reuter's\nestablishment; pale, blighted image, where life lingered feebly, but\nwhence the soul had been conjured by Romish wizard-craft!\n\nA few English pupils there were in this school, and these might be\ndivided into two classes. 1st. The continental English--the daughters\nchiefly of broken adventurers, whom debt or dishonour had driven from\ntheir own country. These poor girls had never known the advantages\nof settled homes, decorous example, or honest Protestant education;\nresident a few months now in one Catholic school, now in another, as\ntheir parents wandered from land to land--from France to Germany, from\nGermany to Belgium--they had picked up some scanty instruction, many bad\nhabits, losing every notion even of the first elements of religion and\nmorals, and acquiring an imbecile indifference to every sentiment that\ncan elevate humanity; they were distinguishable by an habitual look\nof sullen dejection, the result of crushed self-respect and constant\nbrowbeating from their Popish fellow-pupils, who hated them as English,\nand scorned them as heretics.\n\nThe second class were British English. Of these I did not encounter half\na dozen during the whole time of my attendance at the seminary; their\ncharacteristics were clean but careless dress, ill-arranged hair\n(compared with the tight and trim foreigners), erect carriage, flexible\nfigures, white and taper hands, features more irregular, but also more\nintellectual than those of the Belgians, grave and modest countenances,\na general air of native propriety and decency; by this last circumstance\nalone I could at a glance distinguish the daughter of Albion and\nnursling of Protestantism from the foster-child of Rome, the PROTEGEE\nof Jesuistry: proud, too, was the aspect of these British girls; at once\nenvied and ridiculed by their continental associates, they warded off\ninsult with austere civility, and met hate with mute disdain; they\neschewed company-keeping, and in the midst of numbers seemed to dwell\nisolated.\n\nThe teachers presiding over this mixed multitude were three in number,\nall French--their names Mdlles. Zephyrine, Pelagie, and Suzette; the two\nlast were commonplace personages enough; their look was ordinary,\ntheir manner was ordinary, their temper was ordinary, their thoughts,\nfeelings, and views were all ordinary--were I to write a chapter on the\nsubject I could not elucidate it further. Zephyrine was somewhat more\ndistinguished in appearance and deportment than Pelagie and Suzette,\nbut in character genuine Parisian coquette, perfidious, mercenary, and\ndry-hearted. A fourth maitresse I sometimes saw who seemed to come daily\nto teach needlework, or netting, or lace-mending, or some such flimsy\nart; but of her I never had more than a passing glimpse, as she sat in\nthe CARRE, with her frames and some dozen of the elder pupils about her,\nconsequently I had no opportunity of studying her character, or even of\nobserving her person much; the latter, I remarked, had a very English\nair for a maitresse, otherwise it was not striking; of character I\nshould think she possessed but little, as her pupils seemed constantly\n\"en revolte\" against her authority. She did not reside in the house; her\nname, I think, was Mdlle. Henri.\n\nAmidst this assemblage of all that was insignificant and defective, much\nthat was vicious and repulsive (by that last epithet many would have\ndescribed the two or three stiff, silent, decently behaved, ill-dressed\nBritish girls), the sensible, sagacious, affable directress shone like a\nsteady star over a marsh full of Jack-o'-lanthorns; profoundly aware\nof her superiority, she derived an inward bliss from that consciousness\nwhich sustained her under all the care and responsibility inseparable\nfrom her position; it kept her temper calm, her brow smooth, her manner\ntranquil. She liked--as who would not?--on entering the school-room,\nto feel that her sole presence sufficed to diffuse that order and\nquiet which all the remonstrances, and even commands, of her underlings\nfrequently failed to enforce; she liked to stand in comparison, or\nrather--contrast, with those who surrounded her, and to know that in\npersonal as well as mental advantages, she bore away the undisputed\npalm of preference--(the three teachers were all plain.) Her pupils she\nmanaged with such indulgence and address, taking always on herself the\noffice of recompenser and eulogist, and abandoning to her subalterns\nevery invidious task of blame and punishment, that they all regarded her\nwith deference, if not with affection; her teachers did not love her,\nbut they submitted because they were her inferiors in everything; the\nvarious masters who attended her school were each and all in some way\nor other under her influence; over one she had acquired power by her\nskilful management of his bad temper; over another by little attentions\nto his petty caprices; a third she had subdued by flattery; a fourth--a\ntimid man--she kept in awe by a sort of austere decision of mien; me,\nshe still watched, still tried by the most ingenious tests--she roved\nround me, baffled, yet persevering; I believe she thought I was like\na smooth and bare precipice, which offered neither jutting stone nor\ntree-root, nor tuft of grass to aid the climber. Now she flattered\nwith exquisite tact, now she moralized, now she tried how far I was\naccessible to mercenary motives, then she disported on the brink of\naffection--knowing that some men are won by weakness--anon, she talked\nexcellent sense, aware that others have the folly to admire judgment.\nI found it at once pleasant and easy to evade all these efforts; it was\nsweet, when she thought me nearly won, to turn round and to smile in\nher very eyes, half scornfully, and then to witness her scarcely veiled,\nthough mute mortification. Still she persevered, and at last, I am bound\nto confess it, her finger, essaying, proving every atom of the casket,\ntouched its secret spring, and for a moment the lid sprung open; she\nlaid her hand on the jewel within; whether she stole and broke it, or\nwhether the lid shut again with a snap on her fingers, read on, and you\nshall know.\n\nIt happened that I came one day to give a lesson when I was indisposed;\nI had a bad cold and a cough; two hours' incessant talking left me very\nhoarse and tired; as I quitted the schoolroom, and was passing along the\ncorridor, I met Mdlle. Reuter; she remarked, with an anxious air, that\nI looked very pale and tired. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I was fatigued;\" and then,\nwith increased interest, she rejoined, \"You shall not go away till you\nhave had some refreshment.\" She persuaded me to step into the parlour,\nand was very kind and gentle while I stayed. The next day she was kinder\nstill; she came herself into the class to see that the windows were\nclosed, and that there was no draught; she exhorted me with friendly\nearnestness not to over-exert myself; when I went away, she gave me\nher hand unasked, and I could not but mark, by a respectful and gentle\npressure, that I was sensible of the favour, and grateful for it. My\nmodest demonstration kindled a little merry smile on her countenance;\nI thought her almost charming. During the remainder of the evening, my\nmind was full of impatience for the afternoon of the next day to arrive,\nthat I might see her again.\n\nI was not disappointed, for she sat in the class during the whole of my\nsubsequent lesson, and often looked at me almost with affection. At four\no'clock she accompanied me out of the schoolroom, asking with solicitude\nafter my health, then scolding me sweetly because I spoke too loud and\ngave myself too much trouble; I stopped at the glass-door which led into\nthe garden, to hear her lecture to the end; the door was open, it was a\nvery fine day, and while I listened to the soothing reprimand, I looked\nat the sunshine and flowers, and felt very happy. The day-scholars began\nto pour from the schoolrooms into the passage.\n\n\"Will you go into the garden a minute or two,\" asked she, \"till they are\ngone?\"\n\nI descended the steps without answering, but I looked back as much as to\nsay--\n\n\"You will come with me?\"\n\nIn another minute I and the directress were walking side by side down\nthe alley bordered with fruit-trees, whose white blossoms were then in\nfull blow as well as their tender green leaves. The sky was blue, the\nair still, the May afternoon was full of brightness and fragrance.\nReleased from the stifling class, surrounded with flowers and foliage,\nwith a pleasing, smiling, affable woman at my side--how did I feel? Why,\nvery enviably. It seemed as if the romantic visions my imagination had\nsuggested of this garden, while it was yet hidden from me by the jealous\nboards, were more than realized; and, when a turn in the alley shut out\nthe view of the house, and some tall shrubs excluded M. Pelet's\nmansion, and screened us momentarily from the other houses, rising\namphitheatre-like round this green spot, I gave my arm to Mdlle. Reuter,\nand led her to a garden-chair, nestled under some lilacs near. She sat\ndown; I took my place at her side. She went on talking to me with that\nease which communicates ease, and, as I listened, a revelation dawned\nin my mind that I was on the brink of falling in love. The dinner-bell\nrang, both at her house and M. Pelet's; we were obliged to part; I\ndetained her a moment as she was moving away.\n\n\"I want something,\" said I.\n\n\"What?\" asked Zoraide naively.\n\n\"Only a flower.\"\n\n\"Gather it then--or two, or twenty, if you like.\"\n\n\"No--one will do--but you must gather it, and give it to me.\"\n\n\"What a caprice!\" she exclaimed, but she raised herself on her tip-toes,\nand, plucking a beautiful branch of lilac, offered it to me with grace.\nI took it, and went away, satisfied for the present, and hopeful for the\nfuture.\n\nCertainly that May day was a lovely one, and it closed in moonlight\nnight of summer warmth and serenity. I remember this well; for, having\nsat up late that evening, correcting devoirs, and feeling weary and\na little oppressed with the closeness of my small room, I opened the\noften-mentioned boarded window, whose boards, however, I had persuaded\nold Madame Pelet to have removed since I had filled the post of\nprofessor in the pensionnat de demoiselles, as, from that time, it\nwas no longer \"inconvenient\" for me to overlook my own pupils at their\nsports. I sat down in the window-seat, rested my arm on the sill,\nand leaned out: above me was the clear-obscure of a cloudless\nnight sky--splendid moonlight subdued the tremulous sparkle of the\nstars--below lay the garden, varied with silvery lustre and deep shade,\nand all fresh with dew--a grateful perfume exhaled from the closed\nblossoms of the fruit-trees--not a leaf stirred, the night was\nbreezeless. My window looked directly down upon a certain walk of Mdlle.\nReuter's garden, called \"l'allee defendue,\" so named because the pupils\nwere forbidden to enter it on account of its proximity to the boys'\nschool. It was here that the lilacs and laburnums grew especially thick;\nthis was the most sheltered nook in the enclosure, its shrubs screened\nthe garden-chair where that afternoon I had sat with the young\ndirectress. I need not say that my thoughts were chiefly with her as\nI leaned from the lattice, and let my eye roam, now over the walks and\nborders of the garden, now along the many-windowed front of the house\nwhich rose white beyond the masses of foliage. I wondered in what part\nof the building was situated her apartment; and a single light, shining\nthrough the persiennes of one croisee, seemed to direct me to it.\n\n\"She watches late,\" thought I, \"for it must be now near midnight. She\nis a fascinating little woman,\" I continued in voiceless soliloquy; \"her\nimage forms a pleasant picture in memory; I know she is not what the\nworld calls pretty--no matter, there is harmony in her aspect, and I\nlike it; her brown hair, her blue eye, the freshness of her cheek, the\nwhiteness of her neck, all suit my taste. Then I respect her talent;\nthe idea of marrying a doll or a fool was always abhorrent to me: I know\nthat a pretty doll, a fair fool, might do well enough for the honeymoon;\nbut when passion cooled, how dreadful to find a lump of wax and wood\nlaid in my bosom, a half idiot clasped in my arms, and to remember that\nI had made of this my equal--nay, my idol--to know that I must pass the\nrest of my dreary life with a creature incapable of understanding what\nI said, of appreciating what I thought, or of sympathizing with what I\nfelt! \"Now, Zoraide Reuter,\" thought I, \"has tact, CARACTERE, judgment,\ndiscretion; has she heart? What a good, simple little smile played\nabout her lips when she gave me the branch of lilacs! I have thought her\ncrafty, dissembling, interested sometimes, it is true; but may not much\nthat looks like cunning and dissimulation in her conduct be only\nthe efforts made by a bland temper to traverse quietly perplexing\ndifficulties? And as to interest, she wishes to make her way in the\nworld, no doubt, and who can blame her? Even if she be truly deficient\nin sound principle, is it not rather her misfortune than her fault? She\nhas been brought up a Catholic: had she been born an Englishwoman, and\nreared a Protestant, might she not have added straight integrity to\nall her other excellences? Supposing she were to marry an English and\nProtestant husband, would she not, rational, sensible as she is, quickly\nacknowledge the superiority of right over expediency, honesty over\npolicy? It would be worth a man's while to try the experiment; to-morrow\nI will renew my observations. She knows that I watch her: how calm she\nis under scrutiny! it seems rather to gratify than annoy her.\" Here a\nstrain of music stole in upon my monologue, and suspended it; it was\na bugle, very skilfully played, in the neighbourhood of the park, I\nthought, or on the Place Royale. So sweet were the tones, so subduing\ntheir effect at that hour, in the midst of silence and under the\nquiet reign of moonlight, I ceased to think, that I might listen more\nintently. The strain retreated, its sound waxed fainter and was soon\ngone; my ear prepared to repose on the absolute hush of midnight once\nmore. No. What murmur was that which, low, and yet near and approaching\nnearer, frustrated the expectation of total silence? It was some one\nconversing--yes, evidently, an audible, though subdued voice spoke in\nthe garden immediately below me. Another answered; the first voice was\nthat of a man, the second that of a woman; and a man and a woman I saw\ncoming slowly down the alley. Their forms were at first in shade, I\ncould but discern a dusk outline of each, but a ray of moonlight met\nthem at the termination of the walk, when they were under my very nose,\nand revealed very plainly, very unequivocally, Mdlle. Zoraide Reuter,\narm-in-arm, or hand-in-hand (I forget which) with my principal,\nconfidant, and counsellor, M. Francois Pelet. And M. Pelet was saying--\n\n\"A quand donc le jour des noces, ma bien-aimee?\"\n\nAnd Mdlle. Reuter answered--\n\n\"Mais, Francois, tu sais bien qu'il me serait impossible de me marier\navant les vacances.\"\n\n\"June, July, August, a whole quarter!\" exclaimed the director. \"How can\nI wait so long?--I who am ready, even now, to expire at your feet with\nimpatience!\"\n\n\"Ah! if you die, the whole affair will be settled without any trouble\nabout notaries and contracts; I shall only have to order a slight\nmourning dress, which will be much sooner prepared than the nuptial\ntrousseau.\"\n\n\"Cruel Zoraide! you laugh at the distress of one who loves you so\ndevotedly as I do: my torment is your sport; you scruple not to stretch\nmy soul on the rack of jealousy; for, deny it as you will, I am certain\nyou have cast encouraging glances on that school-boy, Crimsworth; he has\npresumed to fall in love, which he dared not have done unless you had\ngiven him room to hope.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Francois? Do you say Crimsworth is in love with me?\"\n\n\"Over head and ears.\"\n\n\"Has he told you so?\"\n\n\"No--but I see it in his face: he blushes whenever your name is\nmentioned.\" A little laugh of exulting coquetry announced Mdlle.\nReuter's gratification at this piece of intelligence (which was a lie,\nby-the-by--I had never been so far gone as that, after all). M. Pelet\nproceeded to ask what she intended to do with me, intimating pretty\nplainly, and not very gallantly, that it was nonsense for her to think\nof taking such a \"blanc-bec\" as a husband, since she must be at least\nten years older than I (was she then thirty-two? I should not have\nthought it). I heard her disclaim any intentions on the subject--the\ndirector, however, still pressed her to give a definite answer.\n\n\"Francois,\" said she, \"you are jealous,\" and still she laughed; then, as\nif suddenly recollecting that this coquetry was not consistent with the\ncharacter for modest dignity she wished to establish, she proceeded,\nin a demure voice: \"Truly, my dear Francois, I will not deny that this\nyoung Englishman may have made some attempts to ingratiate himself with\nme; but, so far from giving him any encouragement, I have always treated\nhim with as much reserve as it was possible to combine with civility;\naffianced as I am to you, I would give no man false hopes; believe me,\ndear friend.\" Still Pelet uttered murmurs of distrust--so I judged, at\nleast, from her reply.\n\n\"What folly! How could I prefer an unknown foreigner to you? And\nthen--not to flatter your vanity--Crimsworth could not bear comparison\nwith you either physically or mentally; he is not a handsome man at all;\nsome may call him gentleman-like and intelligent-looking, but for my\npart--\"\n\nThe rest of the sentence was lost in the distance, as the pair, rising\nfrom the chair in which they had been seated, moved away. I waited their\nreturn, but soon the opening and shutting of a door informed me that\nthey had re-entered the house; I listened a little longer, all was\nperfectly still; I listened more than an hour--at last I heard M. Pelet\ncome in and ascend to his chamber. Glancing once more towards the long\nfront of the garden-house, I perceived that its solitary light was\nat length extinguished; so, for a time, was my faith in love and\nfriendship. I went to bed, but something feverish and fiery had got into\nmy veins which prevented me from sleeping much that night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nNEXT morning I rose with the dawn, and having dressed myself and stood\nhalf-an-hour, my elbow leaning on the chest of drawers, considering what\nmeans I should adopt to restore my spirits, fagged with sleeplessness,\nto their ordinary tone--for I had no intention of getting up a scene\nwith M. Pelet, reproaching him with perfidy, sending him a challenge, or\nperforming other gambadoes of the sort--I hit at last on the\nexpedient of walking out in the cool of the morning to a neighbouring\nestablishment of baths, and treating myself to a bracing plunge.\nThe remedy produced the desired effect. I came back at seven o'clock\nsteadied and invigorated, and was able to greet M. Pelet, when he\nentered to breakfast, with an unchanged and tranquil countenance; even\na cordial offering of the hand and the flattering appellation of \"mon\nfils,\" pronounced in that caressing tone with which Monsieur had, of\nlate days especially, been accustomed to address me, did not elicit any\nexternal sign of the feeling which, though subdued, still glowed at\nmy heart. Not that I nursed vengeance--no; but the sense of insult and\ntreachery lived in me like a kindling, though as yet smothered coal. God\nknows I am not by nature vindictive; I would not hurt a man because I\ncan no longer trust or like him; but neither my reason nor feelings\nare of the vacillating order--they are not of that sand-like sort where\nimpressions, if soon made, are as soon effaced. Once convinced that my\nfriend's disposition is incompatible with my own, once assured that he\nis indelibly stained with certain defects obnoxious to my principles,\nand I dissolve the connection. I did so with Edward. As to Pelet, the\ndiscovery was yet new; should I act thus with him? It was the question I\nplaced before my mind as I stirred my cup of coffee with a half-pistolet\n(we never had spoons), Pelet meantime being seated opposite, his pallid\nface looking as knowing and more haggard than usual, his blue eye\nturned, now sternly on his boys and ushers, and now graciously on me.\n\n\"Circumstances must guide me,\" said I; and meeting Pelet's false glance\nand insinuating smile, I thanked heaven that I had last night opened\nmy window and read by the light of a full moon the true meaning of that\nguileful countenance. I felt half his master, because the reality of\nhis nature was now known to me; smile and flatter as he would, I saw his\nsoul lurk behind his smile, and heard in every one of his smooth phrases\na voice interpreting their treacherous import.\n\nBut Zoraide Reuter? Of course her defection had cut me to the quick?\nThat stint must have gone too deep for any consolations of philosophy\nto be available in curing its smart? Not at all. The night fever over,\nI looked about for balm to that wound also, and found some nearer home\nthan at Gilead. Reason was my physician; she began by proving that the\nprize I had missed was of little value: she admitted that, physically,\nZoraide might have suited me, but affirmed that our souls were not in\nharmony, and that discord must have resulted from the union of her mind\nwith mine. She then insisted on the suppression of all repining,\nand commanded me rather to rejoice that I had escaped a snare. Her\nmedicament did me good. I felt its strengthening effect when I met the\ndirectress the next day; its stringent operation on the nerves suffered\nno trembling, no faltering; it enabled me to face her with firmness,\nto pass her with ease. She had held out her hand to me--that I did not\nchoose to see. She had greeted me with a charming smile--it fell on my\nheart like light on stone. I passed on to the estrade, she followed me;\nher eye, fastened on my face, demanded of every feature the meaning of\nmy changed and careless manner. \"I will give her an answer,\" thought I;\nand, meeting her gaze full, arresting, fixing her glance, I shot into\nher eyes, from my own, a look, where there was no respect, no love,\nno tenderness, no gallantry; where the strictest analysis could detect\nnothing but scorn, hardihood, irony. I made her bear it, and feel it;\nher steady countenance did not change, but her colour rose, and she\napproached me as if fascinated. She stepped on to the estrade, and\nstood close by my side; she had nothing to say. I would not relieve her\nembarrassment, and negligently turned over the leaves of a book.\n\n\"I hope you feel quite recovered to-day,\" at last she said, in a low\ntone.\n\n\"And I, mademoiselle, hope that you took no cold last night in\nconsequence of your late walk in the garden.\"\n\nQuick enough of comprehension, she understood me directly; her face\nbecame a little blanched--a very little--but no muscle in her rather\nmarked features moved; and, calm and self-possessed, she retired from\nthe estrade, taking her seat quietly at a little distance, and occupying\nherself with netting a purse. I proceeded to give my lesson; it was a\n\"Composition,\" i.e., I dictated certain general questions, of which the\npupils were to compose the answers from memory, access to books being\nforbidden. While Mdlle. Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline, &c., were pondering\nover the string of rather abstruse grammatical interrogatories I had\npropounded, I was at liberty to employ the vacant half hour in further\nobserving the directress herself. The green silk purse was progressing\nfast in her hands; her eyes were bent upon it; her attitude, as she\nsat netting within two yards of me, was still yet guarded; in her whole\nperson were expressed at once, and with equal clearness, vigilance and\nrepose--a rare union! Looking at her, I was forced, as I had often been\nbefore, to offer her good sense, her wondrous self-control, the tribute\nof involuntary admiration. She had felt that I had withdrawn from her\nmy esteem; she had seen contempt and coldness in my eye, and to her, who\ncoveted the approbation of all around her, who thirsted after universal\ngood opinion, such discovery must have been an acute wound. I had\nwitnessed its effect in the momentary pallor of her cheek--cheek unused\nto vary; yet how quickly, by dint of self-control, had she recovered\nher composure! With what quiet dignity she now sat, almost at my side,\nsustained by her sound and vigorous sense; no trembling in her somewhat\nlengthened, though shrewd upper lip, no coward shame on her austere\nforehead!\n\n\"There is metal there,\" I said, as I gazed. \"Would that there were fire\nalso, living ardour to make the steel glow--then I could love her.\"\n\nPresently I discovered that she knew I was watching her, for she stirred\nnot, she lifted not her crafty eyelid; she had glanced down from her\nnetting to her small foot, peeping from the soft folds of her purple\nmerino gown; thence her eye reverted to her hand, ivory white, with a\nbright garnet ring on the forefinger, and a light frill of lace round\nthe wrist; with a scarcely perceptible movement she turned her head,\ncausing her nut-brown curls to wave gracefully. In these slight signs\nI read that the wish of her heart, the design of her brain, was to lure\nback the game she had scared. A little incident gave her the opportunity\nof addressing me again.\n\nWhile all was silence in the class--silence, but for the rustling of\ncopy-books and the travelling of pens over their pages--a leaf of the\nlarge folding-door, opening from the hall, unclosed, admitting a\npupil who, after making a hasty obeisance, ensconced herself with some\nappearance of trepidation, probably occasioned by her entering so\nlate, in a vacant seat at the desk nearest the door. Being seated, she\nproceeded, still with an air of hurry and embarrassment, to open her\ncabas, to take out her books; and, while I was waiting for her to look\nup, in order to make out her identity--for, shortsighted as I was, I had\nnot recognized her at her entrance--Mdlle. Reuter, leaving her chair,\napproached the estrade.\n\n\"Monsieur Creemsvort,\" said she, in a whisper: for when the schoolrooms\nwere silent, the directress always moved with velvet tread, and spoke\nin the most subdued key, enforcing order and stillness fully as much\nby example as precept: \"Monsieur Creemsvort, that young person, who has\njust entered, wishes to have the advantage of taking lessons with you in\nEnglish; she is not a pupil of the house; she is, indeed, in one sense,\na teacher, for she gives instruction in lace-mending, and in little\nvarieties of ornamental needle-work. She very properly proposes to\nqualify herself for a higher department of education, and has asked\npermission to attend your lessons, in order to perfect her knowledge\nof English, in which language she has, I believe, already made\nsome progress; of course it is my wish to aid her in an effort\nso praiseworthy; you will permit her then to benefit by your\ninstruction--n'est ce pas, monsieur?\" And Mdlle. Reuter's eyes were\nraised to mine with a look at once naive, benign, and beseeching.\n\nI replied, \"Of course,\" very laconically, almost abruptly.\n\n\"Another word,\" she said, with softness: \"Mdlle. Henri has not received\na regular education; perhaps her natural talents are not of the highest\norder: but I can assure you of the excellence of her intentions, and\neven of the amiability of her disposition. Monsieur will then, I am\nsure, have the goodness to be considerate with her at first, and not\nexpose her backwardness, her inevitable deficiencies, before the young\nladies, who, in a sense, are her pupils. Will Monsieur Creemsvort favour\nme by attending to this hint?\" I nodded. She continued with subdued\nearnestness--\n\n\"Pardon me, monsieur, if I venture to add that what I have just said is\nof importance to the poor girl; she already experiences great difficulty\nin impressing these giddy young things with a due degree of deference\nfor her authority, and should that difficulty be increased by new\ndiscoveries of her incapacity, she might find her position in my\nestablishment too painful to be retained; a circumstance I should much\nregret for her sake, as she can ill afford to lose the profits of her\noccupation here.\"\n\nMdlle. Reuter possessed marvellous tact; but tact the most exclusive,\nunsupported by sincerity, will sometimes fail of its effect; thus, on\nthis occasion, the longer she preached about the necessity of being\nindulgent to the governess pupil, the more impatient I felt as I\nlistened. I discerned so clearly that while her professed motive was a\nwish to aid the dull, though well-meaning Mdlle. Henri, her real one\nwas no other than a design to impress me with an idea of her own exalted\ngoodness and tender considerateness; so having again hastily nodded\nassent to her remarks, I obviated their renewal by suddenly demanding\nthe compositions, in a sharp accent, and stepping from the estrade, I\nproceeded to collect them. As I passed the governess-pupil, I said to\nher--\n\n\"You have come in too late to receive a lesson to-day; try to be more\npunctual next time.\"\n\nI was behind her, and could not read in her face the effect of my not\nvery civil speech. Probably I should not have troubled myself to do so,\nhad I been full in front; but I observed that she immediately began\nto slip her books into her cabas again; and, presently, after I had\nreturned to the estrade, while I was arranging the mass of compositions,\nI heard the folding-door again open and close; and, on looking up, I\nperceived her place vacant. I thought to myself, \"She will consider her\nfirst attempt at taking a lesson in English something of a failure;\" and\nI wondered whether she had departed in the sulks, or whether stupidity\nhad induced her to take my words too literally, or, finally, whether\nmy irritable tone had wounded her feelings. The last notion I dismissed\nalmost as soon as I had conceived it, for not having seen any appearance\nof sensitiveness in any human face since my arrival in Belgium, I had\nbegun to regard it almost as a fabulous quality. Whether her physiognomy\nannounced it I could not tell, for her speedy exit had allowed me no\ntime to ascertain the circumstance. I had, indeed, on two or three\nprevious occasions, caught a passing view of her (as I believe has been\nmentioned before); but I had never stopped to scrutinize either her face\nor person, and had but the most vague idea of her general appearance.\nJust as I had finished rolling up the compositions, the four o'clock\nbell rang; with my accustomed alertness in obeying that signal, I\ngrasped my hat and evacuated the premises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nIF I was punctual in quitting Mdlle. Reuter's domicile, I was at least\nequally punctual in arriving there; I came the next day at five minutes\nbefore two, and on reaching the schoolroom door, before I opened it, I\nheard a rapid, gabbling sound, which warned me that the \"priere du midi\"\nwas not yet concluded. I waited the termination thereof; it would have\nbeen impious to intrude my heretical presence during its progress. How\nthe repeater of the prayer did cackle and splutter! I never before or\nsince heard language enounced with such steam-engine haste. \"Notre Pere\nqui etes au ciel\" went off like a shot; then followed an address to\nMarie \"vierge celeste, reine des anges, maison d'or, tour d'ivoire!\" and\nthen an invocation to the saint of the day; and then down they all sat,\nand the solemn (?) rite was over; and I entered, flinging the door wide\nand striding in fast, as it was my wont to do now; for I had found\nthat in entering with aplomb, and mounting the estrade with emphasis,\nconsisted the grand secret of ensuring immediate silence. The\nfolding-doors between the two classes, opened for the prayer, were\ninstantly closed; a maitresse, work-box in hand, took her seat at her\nappropriate desk; the pupils sat still with their pens and books before\nthem; my three beauties in the van, now well humbled by a demeanour of\nconsistent coolness, sat erect with their hands folded quietly on their\nknees; they had given up giggling and whispering to each other, and no\nlonger ventured to utter pert speeches in my presence; they now only\ntalked to me occasionally with their eyes, by means of which organs\nthey could still, however, say very audacious and coquettish things. Had\naffection, goodness, modesty, real talent, ever employed those bright\norbs as interpreters, I do not think I could have refrained from giving\na kind and encouraging, perhaps an ardent reply now and then; but as it\nwas, I found pleasure in answering the glance of vanity with the gaze\nof stoicism. Youthful, fair, brilliant, as were many of my pupils, I can\ntruly say that in me they never saw any other bearing than such as an\naustere, though just guardian, might have observed towards them. If any\ndoubt the accuracy of this assertion, as inferring more conscientious\nself-denial or Scipio-like self-control than they feel disposed to\ngive me credit for, let them take into consideration the following\ncircumstances, which, while detracting from my merit, justify my\nveracity.\n\nKnow, O incredulous reader! that a master stands in a somewhat different\nrelation towards a pretty, light-headed, probably ignorant girl, to\nthat occupied by a partner at a ball, or a gallant on the promenade.\nA professor does not meet his pupil to see her dressed in satin and\nmuslin, with hair perfumed and curled, neck scarcely shaded by aerial\nlace, round white arms circled with bracelets, feet dressed for the\ngliding dance. It is not his business to whirl her through the waltz,\nto feed her with compliments, to heighten her beauty by the flush of\ngratified vanity. Neither does he encounter her on the smooth-rolled,\ntree shaded Boulevard, in the green and sunny park, whither she repairs\nclad in her becoming walking dress, her scarf thrown with grace over her\nshoulders, her little bonnet scarcely screening her curls, the red rose\nunder its brim adding a new tint to the softer rose on her cheek; her\nface and eyes, too, illumined with smiles, perhaps as transient as the\nsunshine of the gala-day, but also quite as brilliant; it is not his\noffice to walk by her side, to listen to her lively chat, to carry her\nparasol, scarcely larger than a broad green leaf, to lead in a ribbon\nher Blenheim spaniel or Italian greyhound. No: he finds her in the\nschoolroom, plainly dressed, with books before her. Owing to her\neducation or her nature books are to her a nuisance, and she opens them\nwith aversion, yet her teacher must instil into her mind the contents\nof these books; that mind resists the admission of grave information, it\nrecoils, it grows restive, sullen tempers are shown, disfiguring frowns\nspoil the symmetry of the face, sometimes coarse gestures banish grace\nfrom the deportment, while muttered expressions, redolent of native and\nineradicable vulgarity, desecrate the sweetness of the voice. Where the\ntemperament is serene though the intellect be sluggish, an unconquerable\ndullness opposes every effort to instruct. Where there is cunning but\nnot energy, dissimulation, falsehood, a thousand schemes and tricks\nare put in play to evade the necessity of application; in short, to the\ntutor, female youth, female charms are like tapestry hangings, of which\nthe wrong side is continually turned towards him; and even when he sees\nthe smooth, neat external surface he so well knows what knots, long\nstitches, and jagged ends are behind that he has scarce a temptation to\nadmire too fondly the seemly forms and bright colours exposed to general\nview.\n\nOur likings are regulated by our circumstances. The artist prefers a\nhilly country because it is picturesque; the engineer a flat one because\nit is convenient; the man of pleasure likes what he calls \"a fine\nwoman\"--she suits him; the fashionable young gentleman admires the\nfashionable young lady--she is of his kind; the toil-worn, fagged,\nprobably irritable tutor, blind almost to beauty, insensible to airs and\ngraces, glories chiefly in certain mental qualities: application, love\nof knowledge, natural capacity, docility, truthfulness, gratefulness,\nare the charms that attract his notice and win his regard. These he\nseeks, but seldom meets; these, if by chance he finds, he would fain\nretain for ever, and when separation deprives him of them he feels as if\nsome ruthless hand had snatched from him his only ewe-lamb. Such being\nthe case, and the case it is, my readers will agree with me that there\nwas nothing either very meritorious or very marvellous in the\nintegrity and moderation of my conduct at Mdlle. Reuter's pensionnat de\ndemoiselles.\n\nMy first business this afternoon consisted in reading the list of\nplaces for the month, determined by the relative correctness of the\ncompositions given the preceding day. The list was headed, as usual,\nby the name of Sylvie, that plain, quiet little girl I have described\nbefore as being at once the best and ugliest pupil in the establishment;\nthe second place had fallen to the lot of a certain Leonie Ledru, a\ndiminutive, sharp-featured, and parchment-skinned creature of quick\nwits, frail conscience, and indurated feelings; a lawyer-like thing, of\nwhom I used to say that, had she been a boy, she would have made a\nmodel of an unprincipled, clever attorney. Then came Eulalie, the proud\nbeauty, the Juno of the school, whom six long years of drilling in the\nsimple grammar of the English language had compelled, despite the stiff\nphlegm of her intellect, to acquire a mechanical acquaintance with most\nof its rules. No smile, no trace of pleasure or satisfaction appeared in\nSylvie's nun-like and passive face as she heard her name read first.\nI always felt saddened by the sight of that poor girl's absolute\nquiescence on all occasions, and it was my custom to look at her, to\naddress her, as seldom as possible; her extreme docility, her assiduous\nperseverance, would have recommended her warmly to my good opinion;\nher modesty, her intelligence, would have induced me to feel most\nkindly--most affectionately towards her, notwithstanding the almost\nghastly plainness of her features, the disproportion of her form, the\ncorpse-like lack of animation in her countenance, had I not been aware\nthat every friendly word, every kindly action, would be reported by her\nto her confessor, and by him misinterpreted and poisoned. Once I laid my\nhand on her head, in token of approbation; I thought Sylvie was going to\nsmile, her dim eye almost kindled; but, presently, she shrank from me;\nI was a man and a heretic; she, poor child! a destined nun and devoted\nCatholic: thus a four-fold wall of separation divided her mind from\nmine. A pert smirk, and a hard glance of triumph, was Leonie's method of\ntestifying her gratification; Eulalie looked sullen and envious--she had\nhoped to be first. Hortense and Caroline exchanged a reckless grimace on\nhearing their names read out somewhere near the bottom of the list; the\nbrand of mental inferiority was considered by them as no disgrace, their\nhopes for the future being based solely on their personal attractions.\n\nThis affair arranged, the regular lesson followed. During a brief\ninterval, employed by the pupils in ruling their books, my eye, ranging\ncarelessly over the benches, observed, for the first time, that the\nfarthest seat in the farthest row--a seat usually vacant--was\nagain filled by the new scholar, the Mdlle. Henri so ostentatiously\nrecommended to me by the directress. To-day I had on my spectacles; her\nappearance, therefore, was clear to me at the first glance; I had not to\npuzzle over it. She looked young; yet, had I been required to name her\nexact age, I should have been somewhat nonplussed; the slightness of her\nfigure might have suited seventeen; a certain anxious and pre-occupied\nexpression of face seemed the indication of riper years. She was\ndressed, like all the rest, in a dark stuff gown and a white collar; her\nfeatures were dissimilar to any there, not so rounded, more defined, yet\nscarcely regular. The shape of her head too was different, the superior\npart more developed, the base considerably less. I felt assured,\nat first sight, that she was not a Belgian; her complexion, her\ncountenance, her lineaments, her figure, were all distinct from theirs,\nand, evidently, the type of another race--of a race less gifted with\nfullness of flesh and plenitude of blood; less jocund, material,\nunthinking. When I first cast my eyes on her, she sat looking fixedly\ndown, her chin resting on her hand, and she did not change her attitude\ntill I commenced the lesson. None of the Belgian girls would have\nretained one position, and that a reflective one, for the same length of\ntime. Yet, having intimated that her appearance was peculiar, as\nbeing unlike that of her Flemish companions, I have little more to say\nrespecting it; I can pronounce no encomiums on her beauty, for she was\nnot beautiful; nor offer condolence on her plainness, for neither\nwas she plain; a careworn character of forehead, and a corresponding\nmoulding of the mouth, struck me with a sentiment resembling surprise,\nbut these traits would probably have passed unnoticed by any less\ncrotchety observer.\n\nNow, reader, though I have spent more than a page in describing Mdlle.\nHenri, I know well enough that I have left on your mind's eye no\ndistinct picture of her; I have not painted her complexion, nor her\neyes, nor her hair, nor even drawn the outline of her shape. You cannot\ntell whether her nose was aquiline or retrousse, whether her chin was\nlong or short, her face square or oval; nor could I the first day,\nand it is not my intention to communicate to you at once a knowledge I\nmyself gained by little and little.\n\nI gave a short exercise: which they all wrote down. I saw the new pupil\nwas puzzled at first with the novelty of the form and language; once\nor twice she looked at me with a sort of painful solicitude, as not\ncomprehending at all what I meant; then she was not ready when the\nothers were, she could not write her phrases so fast as they did; I\nwould not help her, I went on relentless. She looked at me; her eye\nsaid most plainly, \"I cannot follow you.\" I disregarded the appeal, and,\ncarelessly leaning back in my chair, glancing from time to time with a\nNONCHALANT air out of the window, I dictated a little faster. On looking\ntowards her again, I perceived her face clouded with embarrassment, but\nshe was still writing on most diligently; I paused a few seconds; she\nemployed the interval in hurriedly re-perusing what she had written, and\nshame and discomfiture were apparent in her countenance; she evidently\nfound she had made great nonsense of it. In ten minutes more the\ndictation was complete, and, having allowed a brief space in which to\ncorrect it, I took their books; it was with a reluctant hand Mdlle.\nHenri gave up hers, but, having once yielded it to my possession, she\ncomposed her anxious face, as if, for the present she had resolved to\ndismiss regret, and had made up her mind to be thought unprecedentedly\nstupid. Glancing over her exercise, I found that several lines had been\nomitted, but what was written contained very few faults; I instantly\ninscribed \"Bon\" at the bottom of the page, and returned it to her; she\nsmiled, at first incredulously, then as if reassured, but did not\nlift her eyes; she could look at me, it seemed, when perplexed and\nbewildered, but not when gratified; I thought that scarcely fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nSOME time elapsed before I again gave a lesson in the first class; the\nholiday of Whitsuntide occupied three days, and on the fourth it was the\nturn of the second division to receive my instructions. As I made\nthe transit of the CARRE, I observed, as usual, the band of sewers\nsurrounding Mdlle. Henri; there were only about a dozen of them, but\nthey made as much noise as might have sufficed for fifty; they seemed\nvery little under her control; three or four at once assailed her with\nimportunate requirements; she looked harassed, she demanded silence, but\nin vain. She saw me, and I read in her eye pain that a stranger should\nwitness the insubordination of her pupils; she seemed to entreat\norder--her prayers were useless; then I remarked that she compressed\nher lips and contracted her brow; and her countenance, if I read\nit correctly, said--\"I have done my best; I seem to merit blame\nnotwithstanding; blame me then who will.\" I passed on; as I closed the\nschool-room door, I heard her say, suddenly and sharply, addressing one\nof the eldest and most turbulent of the lot--\n\n\"Amelie Mullenberg, ask me no question, and request of me no assistance,\nfor a week to come; during that space of time I will neither speak to\nyou nor help you.\"\n\nThe words were uttered with emphasis--nay, with vehemence--and a\ncomparative silence followed; whether the calm was permanent, I know\nnot; two doors now closed between me and the CARRE.\n\nNext day was appropriated to the first class; on my arrival, I found the\ndirectress seated, as usual, in a chair between the two estrades, and\nbefore her was standing Mdlle. Henri, in an attitude (as it seemed to\nme) of somewhat reluctant attention. The directress was knitting and\ntalking at the same time. Amidst the hum of a large school-room, it was\neasy so to speak in the ear of one person, as to be heard by that person\nalone, and it was thus Mdlle. Reuter parleyed with her teacher. The face\nof the latter was a little flushed, not a little troubled; there was\nvexation in it, whence resulting I know not, for the directress looked\nvery placid indeed; she could not be scolding in such gentle whispers,\nand with so equable a mien; no, it was presently proved that her\ndiscourse had been of the most friendly tendency, for I heard the\nclosing words--\n\n\"C'est assez, ma bonne amie; a present je ne veux pas vous retenir\ndavantage.\"\n\nWithout reply, Mdlle. Henri turned away; dissatisfaction was plainly\nevinced in her face, and a smile, slight and brief, but bitter,\ndistrustful, and, I thought, scornful, curled her lip as she took her\nplace in the class; it was a secret, involuntary smile, which lasted but\na second; an air of depression succeeded, chased away presently by one\nof attention and interest, when I gave the word for all the pupils to\ntake their reading-books. In general I hated the reading-lesson, it\nwas such a torture to the ear to listen to their uncouth mouthing of\nmy native tongue, and no effort of example or precept on my part ever\nseemed to effect the slightest improvement in their accent. To-day,\neach in her appropriate key, lisped, stuttered, mumbled, and jabbered as\nusual; about fifteen had racked me in turn, and my auricular nerve was\nexpecting with resignation the discords of the sixteenth, when a full,\nthough low voice, read out, in clear correct English.\n\n\"On his way to Perth, the king was met by a Highland woman, calling\nherself a prophetess; she stood at the side of the ferry by which he was\nabout to travel to the north, and cried with a loud voice, 'My lord the\nking, if you pass this water you will never return again alive!'\"--(VIDE\nthe HISTORY OF SCOTLAND).\n\nI looked up in amazement; the voice was a voice of Albion; the accent\nwas pure and silvery; it only wanted firmness, and assurance, to be the\ncounterpart of what any well-educated lady in Essex or Middlesex might\nhave enounced, yet the speaker or reader was no other than Mdlle. Henri,\nin whose grave, joyless face I saw no mark of consciousness that she had\nperformed any extraordinary feat. No one else evinced surprise either.\nMdlle. Reuter knitted away assiduously; I was aware, however, that at\nthe conclusion of the paragraph, she had lifted her eyelid and honoured\nme with a glance sideways; she did not know the full excellency of the\nteacher's style of reading, but she perceived that her accent was not\nthat of the others, and wanted to discover what I thought; I masked my\nvisage with indifference, and ordered the next girl to proceed.\n\nWhen the lesson was over, I took advantage of the confusion caused by\nbreaking up, to approach Mdlle. Henri; she was standing near the window\nand retired as I advanced; she thought I wanted to look out, and did\nnot imagine that I could have anything to say to her. I took her\nexercise-book out of her hand; as I turned over the leaves I addressed\nher:--\n\n\"You have had lessons in English before?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"No! you read it well; you have been in England?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" with some animation.\n\n\"You have been in English families?\"\n\nStill the answer was \"No.\" Here my eye, resting on the flyleaf of the\nbook, saw written, \"Frances Evan Henri.\"\n\n\"Your name?\" I asked\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMy interrogations were cut short; I heard a little rustling behind me,\nand close at my back was the directress, professing to be examining the\ninterior of a desk.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said she, looking up and addressing the teacher, \"Will\nyou have the goodness to go and stand in the corridor, while the young\nladies are putting on their things, and try to keep some order?\"\n\nMdlle. Henri obeyed.\n\n\"What splendid weather!\" observed the directress cheerfully, glancing at\nthe same time from the window. I assented and was withdrawing. \"What of\nyour new pupil, monsieur?\" continued she, following my retreating steps.\n\"Is she likely to make progress in English?\"\n\n\"Indeed I can hardly judge. She possesses a pretty good accent; of\nher real knowledge of the language I have as yet had no opportunity of\nforming an opinion.\"\n\n\"And her natural capacity, monsieur? I have had my fears about that: can\nyou relieve me by an assurance at least of its average power?\"\n\n\"I see no reason to doubt its average power, mademoiselle, but really\nI scarcely know her, and have not had time to study the calibre of her\ncapacity. I wish you a very good afternoon.\"\n\nShe still pursued me. \"You will observe, monsieur, and tell me what you\nthink; I could so much better rely on your opinion than on my own; women\ncannot judge of these things as men can, and, excuse my pertinacity,\nmonsieur, but it is natural I should feel interested about this poor\nlittle girl (pauvre petite); she has scarcely any relations, her own\nefforts are all she has to look to, her acquirements must be her sole\nfortune; her present position has once been mine, or nearly so; it is\nthen but natural I should sympathize with her; and sometimes when I see\nthe difficulty she has in managing pupils, I feel quite chagrined.\nI doubt not she does her best, her intentions are excellent; but,\nmonsieur, she wants tact and firmness. I have talked to her on the\nsubject, but I am not fluent, and probably did not express myself\nwith clearness; she never appears to comprehend me. Now, would you\noccasionally, when you see an opportunity, slip in a word of advice\nto her on the subject; men have so much more influence than women\nhave--they argue so much more logically than we do; and you, monsieur,\nin particular, have so paramount a power of making yourself obeyed;\na word of advice from you could not but do her good; even if she were\nsullen and headstrong (which I hope she is not), she would scarcely\nrefuse to listen to you; for my own part, I can truly say that I never\nattend one of your lessons without deriving benefit from witnessing your\nmanagement of the pupils. The other masters are a constant source of\nanxiety to me; they cannot impress the young ladies with sentiments of\nrespect, nor restrain the levity natural to youth: in you, monsieur, I\nfeel the most absolute confidence; try then to put this poor child\ninto the way of controlling our giddy, high-spirited Brabantoises.\nBut, monsieur, I would add one word more; don't alarm her AMOUR PROPRE;\nbeware of inflicting a wound there. I reluctantly admit that in that\nparticular she is blameably--some would say ridiculously--susceptible.\nI fear I have touched this sore point inadvertently, and she cannot get\nover it.\"\n\nDuring the greater part of this harangue my hand was on the lock of the\nouter door; I now turned it.\n\n\"Au revoir, mademoiselle,\" said I, and I escaped. I saw the directress's\nstock of words was yet far from exhausted. She looked after me, she\nwould fain have detained me longer. Her manner towards me had\nbeen altered ever since I had begun to treat her with hardness and\nindifference: she almost cringed to me on every occasion; she consulted\nmy countenance incessantly, and beset me with innumerable little\nofficious attentions. Servility creates despotism. This slavish homage,\ninstead of softening my heart, only pampered whatever was stern and\nexacting in its mood. The very circumstance of her hovering round me\nlike a fascinated bird, seemed to transform me into a rigid pillar of\nstone; her flatteries irritated my scorn, her blandishments confirmed\nmy reserve. At times I wondered what she meant by giving herself such\ntrouble to win me, when the more profitable Pelet was already in her\nnets, and when, too, she was aware that I possessed her secret, for I\nhad not scrupled to tell her as much: but the fact is that as it was\nher nature to doubt the reality and under-value the worth of modesty,\naffection, disinterestedness--to regard these qualities as foibles of\ncharacter--so it was equally her tendency to consider pride, hardness,\nselfishness, as proofs of strength. She would trample on the neck\nof humility, she would kneel at the feet of disdain; she would meet\ntenderness with secret contempt, indifference she would woo with\nceaseless assiduities. Benevolence, devotedness, enthusiasm, were\nher antipathies; for dissimulation and self-interest she had a\npreference--they were real wisdom in her eyes; moral and physical\ndegradation, mental and bodily inferiority, she regarded with\nindulgence; they were foils capable of being turned to good account as\nset-offs for her own endowments. To violence, injustice, tyranny, she\nsuccumbed--they were her natural masters; she had no propensity to hate,\nno impulse to resist them; the indignation their behests awake in some\nhearts was unknown in hers. From all this it resulted that the false and\nselfish called her wise, the vulgar and debased termed her charitable,\nthe insolent and unjust dubbed her amiable, the conscientious and\nbenevolent generally at first accepted as valid her claim to be\nconsidered one of themselves; but ere long the plating of pretension\nwore off, the real material appeared below, and they laid her aside as a\ndeception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nIn the course of another fortnight I had seen sufficient of Frances\nEvans Henri, to enable me to form a more definite opinion of her\ncharacter. I found her possessed in a somewhat remarkable degree of at\nleast two good points, viz., perseverance and a sense of duty; I\nfound she was really capable of applying to study, of contending with\ndifficulties. At first I offered her the same help which I had always\nfound it necessary to confer on the others; I began with unloosing for\nher each knotty point, but I soon discovered that such help was regarded\nby my new pupil as degrading; she recoiled from it with a certain proud\nimpatience. Hereupon I appointed her long lessons, and left her to solve\nalone any perplexities they might present. She set to the task with\nserious ardour, and having quickly accomplished one labour, eagerly\ndemanded more. So much for her perseverance; as to her sense of duty,\nit evinced itself thus: she liked to learn, but hated to teach; her\nprogress as a pupil depended upon herself, and I saw that on herself she\ncould calculate with certainty; her success as a teacher rested partly,\nperhaps chiefly, upon the will of others; it cost her a most painful\neffort to enter into conflict with this foreign will, to endeavour\nto bend it into subjection to her own; for in what regarded people in\ngeneral the action of her will was impeded by many scruples; it was as\nunembarrassed as strong where her own affairs were concerned, and to it\nshe could at any time subject her inclination, if that inclination went\ncounter to her convictions of right; yet when called upon to wrestle\nwith the propensities, the habits, the faults of others, of children\nespecially, who are deaf to reason, and, for the most part, insensate to\npersuasion, her will sometimes almost refused to act; then came in the\nsense of duty, and forced the reluctant will into operation. A wasteful\nexpense of energy and labour was frequently the consequence; Frances\ntoiled for and with her pupils like a drudge, but it was long ere her\nconscientious exertions were rewarded by anything like docility on their\npart, because they saw that they had power over her, inasmuch as by\nresisting her painful attempts to convince, persuade, control--by\nforcing her to the employment of coercive measures--they could\ninflict upon her exquisite suffering. Human beings--human children\nespecially--seldom deny themselves the pleasure of exercising a power\nwhich they are conscious of possessing, even though that power consist\nonly in a capacity to make others wretched; a pupil whose sensations are\nduller than those of his instructor, while his nerves are tougher and\nhis bodily strength perhaps greater, has an immense advantage over that\ninstructor, and he will generally use it relentlessly, because the very\nyoung, very healthy, very thoughtless, know neither how to sympathize\nnor how to spare. Frances, I fear, suffered much; a continual weight\nseemed to oppress her spirits; I have said she did not live in the\nhouse, and whether in her own abode, wherever that might be, she wore\nthe same preoccupied, unsmiling, sorrowfully resolved air that always\nshaded her features under the roof of Mdlle. Reuter, I could not tell.\n\nOne day I gave, as a devoir, the trite little anecdote of Alfred tending\ncakes in the herdsman's hut, to be related with amplifications. A\nsingular affair most of the pupils made of it; brevity was what they\nhad chiefly studied; the majority of the narratives were perfectly\nunintelligible; those of Sylvie and Leonie Ledru alone pretended to\nanything like sense and connection. Eulalie, indeed, had hit, upon a\nclever expedient for at once ensuring accuracy and saving trouble; she\nhad obtained access somehow to an abridged history of England, and had\ncopied the anecdote out fair. I wrote on the margin of her production\n\"Stupid and deceitful,\" and then tore it down the middle.\n\nLast in the pile of single-leaved devoirs, I found one of several\nsheets, neatly written out and stitched together; I knew the hand, and\nscarcely needed the evidence of the signature \"Frances Evans Henri\" to\nconfirm my conjecture as to the writer's identity.\n\nNight was my usual time for correcting devoirs, and my own room the\nusual scene of such task--task most onerous hitherto; and it seemed\nstrange to me to feel rising within me an incipient sense of interest,\nas I snuffed the candle and addressed myself to the perusal of the poor\nteacher's manuscript.\n\n\"Now,\" thought I, \"I shall see a glimpse of what she really is; I shall\nget an idea of the nature and extent of her powers; not that she can be\nexpected to express herself well in a foreign tongue, but still, if she\nhas any mind, here will be a reflection of it.\"\n\nThe narrative commenced by a description of a Saxon peasant's hut,\nsituated within the confines of a great, leafless, winter forest; it\nrepresented an evening in December; flakes of snow were falling, and\nthe herdsman foretold a heavy storm; he summoned his wife to aid him in\ncollecting their flock, roaming far away on the pastoral banks of the\nThone; he warns her that it will be late ere they return. The good woman\nis reluctant to quit her occupation of baking cakes for the evening\nmeal; but acknowledging the primary importance of securing the herds and\nflocks, she puts on her sheep-skin mantle; and, addressing a stranger\nwho rests half reclined on a bed of rushes near the hearth, bids him\nmind the bread till her return.\n\n\"Take care, young man,\" she continues, \"that you fasten the door well\nafter us; and, above all, open to none in our absence; whatever sound\nyou hear, stir not, and look not out. The night will soon fall; this\nforest is most wild and lonely; strange noises are often heard therein\nafter sunset; wolves haunt these glades, and Danish warriors infest the\ncountry; worse things are talked of; you might chance to hear, as it\nwere, a child cry, and on opening the door to afford it succour, a greet\nblack bull, or a shadowy goblin dog, might rush over the threshold;\nor, more awful still, if something flapped, as with wings, against the\nlattice, and then a raven or a white dove flew in and settled on the\nhearth, such a visitor would be a sure sign of misfortune to the house;\ntherefore, heed my advice, and lift the latchet for nothing.\"\n\nHer husband calls her away, both depart. The stranger, left alone,\nlistens awhile to the muffled snow-wind, the remote, swollen sound of\nthe river, and then he speaks.\n\n\"It is Christmas Eve,\" says he, \"I mark the date; here I sit alone on\na rude couch of rushes, sheltered by the thatch of a herdsman's hut;\nI, whose inheritance was a kingdom, owe my night's harbourage to a poor\nserf; my throne is usurped, my crown presses the brow of an invader; I\nhave no friends; my troops wander broken in the hills of Wales; reckless\nrobbers spoil my country; my subjects lie prostrate, their breasts\ncrushed by the heel of the brutal Dane. Fate! thou hast done thy worst,\nand now thou standest before me resting thy hand on thy blunted blade.\nAy; I see thine eye confront mine and demand why I still live, why I\nstill hope. Pagan demon, I credit not thine omnipotence, and so cannot\nsuccumb to thy power. My God, whose Son, as on this night, took on Him\nthe form of man, and for man vouchsafed to suffer and bleed, controls\nthy hand, and without His behest thou canst not strike a stroke. My God\nis sinless, eternal, all-wise--in Him is my trust; and though stripped\nand crushed by thee--though naked, desolate, void of resource--I do not\ndespair, I cannot despair: were the lance of Guthrum now wet with my\nblood, I should not despair. I watch, I toil, I hope, I pray; Jehovah,\nin his own time, will aid.\"\n\nI need not continue the quotation; the whole devoir was in the same\nstrain. There were errors of orthography, there were foreign idioms,\nthere were some faults of construction, there were verbs irregular\ntransformed into verbs regular; it was mostly made up, as the above\nexample shows, of short and somewhat rude sentences, and the style stood\nin great need of polish and sustained dignity; yet such as it was, I\nhad hitherto seen nothing like it in the course of my professorial\nexperience. The girl's mind had conceived a picture of the hut, of the\ntwo peasants, of the crownless king; she had imagined the wintry forest,\nshe had recalled the old Saxon ghost-legends, she had appreciated\nAlfred's courage under calamity, she had remembered his Christian\neducation, and had shown him, with the rooted confidence of those\nprimitive days, relying on the scriptural Jehovah for aid against the\nmythological Destiny. This she had done without a hint from me: I had\ngiven the subject, but not said a word about the manner of treating it.\n\n\"I will find, or make, an opportunity of speaking to her,\" I said to\nmyself as I rolled the devoir up; \"I will learn what she has of English\nin her besides the name of Frances Evans; she is no novice in the\nlanguage, that is evident, yet she told me she had neither been in\nEngland, nor taken lessons in English, nor lived in English families.\"\n\nIn the course of my next lesson, I made a report of the other devoirs,\ndealing out praise and blame in very small retail parcels, according to\nmy custom, for there was no use in blaming severely, and high encomiums\nwere rarely merited. I said nothing of Mdlle. Henri's exercise, and,\nspectacles on nose, I endeavoured to decipher in her countenance her\nsentiments at the omission. I wanted to find out whether in her existed\na consciousness of her own talents. \"If she thinks she did a clever\nthing in composing that devoir, she will now look mortified,\" thought\nI. Grave as usual, almost sombre, was her face; as usual, her eyes were\nfastened on the cahier open before her; there was something, I thought,\nof expectation in her attitude, as I concluded a brief review of the\nlast devoir, and when, casting it from me and rubbing my hands, I bade\nthem take their grammars, some slight change did pass over her air\nand mien, as though she now relinquished a faint prospect of pleasant\nexcitement; she had been waiting for something to be discussed in which\nshe had a degree of interest; the discussion was not to come on, so\nexpectation sank back, shrunk and sad, but attention, promptly filling\nup the void, repaired in a moment the transient collapse of feature;\nstill, I felt, rather than saw, during the whole course of the lesson,\nthat a hope had been wrenched from her, and that if she did not show\ndistress, it was because she would not.\n\nAt four o'clock, when the bell rang and the room was in immediate\ntumult, instead of taking my hat and starting from the estrade, I sat\nstill a moment. I looked at Frances, she was putting her books into her\ncabas; having fastened the button, she raised her head; encountering my\neye, she made a quiet, respectful obeisance, as bidding good afternoon,\nand was turning to depart:--\n\n\"Come here,\" said I, lifting my finger at the same time. She hesitated;\nshe could not hear the words amidst the uproar now pervading both\nschool-rooms; I repeated the sign; she approached; again she paused\nwithin half a yard of the estrade, and looked shy, and still doubtful\nwhether she had mistaken my meaning.\n\n\"Step up,\" I said, speaking with decision. It is the only way of dealing\nwith diffident, easily embarrassed characters, and with some slight\nmanual aid I presently got her placed just where I wanted her to be,\nthat is, between my desk and the window, where she was screened from the\nrush of the second division, and where no one could sneak behind her to\nlisten.\n\n\"Take a seat,\" I said, placing a tabouret; and I made her sit down. I\nknew what I was doing would be considered a very strange thing, and,\nwhat was more, I did not care. Frances knew it also, and, I fear, by an\nappearance of agitation and trembling, that she cared much. I drew from\nmy pocket the rolled-up devoir.\n\n\"This is yours, I suppose?\" said I, addressing her in English, for I now\nfelt sure she could speak English.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered distinctly; and as I unrolled it and laid it out\nflat on the desk before her with my hand upon it, and a pencil in that\nhand, I saw her moved, and, as it were, kindled; her depression beamed\nas a cloud might behind which the sun is burning.\n\n\"This devoir has numerous faults,\" said I. \"It will take you some years\nof careful study before you are in a condition to write English with\nabsolute correctness. Attend: I will point out some principal defects.\"\nAnd I went through it carefully, noting every error, and demonstrating\nwhy they were errors, and how the words or phrases ought to have been\nwritten. In the course of this sobering process she became calm. I now\nwent on:\n\n\"As to the substance of your devoir, Mdlle. Henri, it has surprised me;\nI perused it with pleasure, because I saw in it some proofs of taste and\nfancy. Taste and fancy are not the highest gifts of the human mind, but\nsuch as they are you possess them--not probably in a paramount degree,\nbut in a degree beyond what the majority can boast. You may then take\ncourage; cultivate the faculties that God and nature have bestowed on\nyou, and do not fear in any crisis of suffering, under any pressure of\ninjustice, to derive free and full consolation from the consciousness of\ntheir strength and rarity.\"\n\n\"Strength and rarity!\" I repeated to myself; \"ay, the words are probably\ntrue,\" for on looking up, I saw the sun had dissevered its screening\ncloud, her countenance was transfigured, a smile shone in her eyes--a\nsmile almost triumphant; it seemed to say--\n\n\"I am glad you have been forced to discover so much of my nature; you\nneed not so carefully moderate your language. Do you think I am myself a\nstranger to myself? What you tell me in terms so qualified, I have known\nfully from a child.\"\n\nShe did say this as plainly as a frank and flashing glance could, but\nin a moment the glow of her complexion, the radiance of her aspect,\nhad subsided; if strongly conscious of her talents, she was equally\nconscious of her harassing defects, and the remembrance of these\nobliterated for a single second, now reviving with sudden force, at once\nsubdued the too vivid characters in which her sense of her powers had\nbeen expressed. So quick was the revulsion of feeling, I had not time to\ncheck her triumph by reproof; ere I could contract my brows to a frown\nshe had become serious and almost mournful-looking.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said she, rising. There was gratitude both in her\nvoice and in the look with which she accompanied it. It was time,\nindeed, for our conference to terminate; for, when I glanced around,\nbehold all the boarders (the day-scholars had departed) were congregated\nwithin a yard or two of my desk, and stood staring with eyes and mouths\nwide open; the three maitresses formed a whispering knot in one corner,\nand, close at my elbow, was the directress, sitting on a low chair,\ncalmly clipping the tassels of her finished purse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nAFTER all I had profited but imperfectly by the opportunity I had so\nboldly achieved of speaking to Mdlle. Henri; it was my intention to ask\nher how she came to be possessed of two English baptismal names, Frances\nand Evans, in addition to her French surname, also whence she derived\nher good accent. I had forgotten both points, or, rather, our colloquy\nhad been so brief that I had not had time to bring them forward;\nmoreover, I had not half tested her powers of speaking English; all I\nhad drawn from her in that language were the words \"Yes,\" and \"Thank\nyou, sir.\" \"No matter,\" I reflected. \"What has been left incomplete now,\nshall be finished another day.\" Nor did I fail to keep the promise thus\nmade to myself. It was difficult to get even a few words of particular\nconversation with one pupil among so many; but, according to the old\nproverb, \"Where there is a will, there is a way;\" and again and again\nI managed to find an opportunity for exchanging a few words with Mdlle.\nHenri, regardless that envy stared and detraction whispered whenever I\napproached her.\n\n\"Your book an instant.\" Such was the mode in which I often began these\nbrief dialogues; the time was always just at the conclusion of the\nlesson; and motioning to her to rise, I installed myself in her place,\nallowing her to stand deferentially at my side; for I esteemed it wise\nand right in her case to enforce strictly all forms ordinarily in\nuse between master and pupil; the rather because I perceived that in\nproportion as my manner grew austere and magisterial, hers became easy\nand self-possessed--an odd contradiction, doubtless, to the ordinary\neffect in such cases; but so it was.\n\n\"A pencil,\" said I, holding out my hand without looking at her. (I am\nnow about to sketch a brief report of the first of these conferences.)\nShe gave me one, and while I underlined some errors in a grammatical\nexercise she had written, I observed--\n\n\"You are not a native of Belgium?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor of France?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where, then, is your birthplace?\"\n\n\"I was born at Geneva.\"\n\n\"You don't call Frances and Evans Swiss names, I presume?\"\n\n\"No, sir; they are English names.\"\n\n\"Just so; and is it the custom of the Genevese to give their children\nEnglish appellatives?\"\n\n\"Non, Monsieur; mais--\"\n\n\"Speak English, if you please.\"\n\n\"Mais--\"\n\n\"English--\"\n\n\"But\" (slowly and with embarrassment) \"my parents were not all the two\nGenevese.\"\n\n\"Say BOTH, instead of 'all the two,' mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Not BOTH Swiss: my mother was English.\"\n\n\"Ah! and of English extraction?\"\n\n\"Yes--her ancestors were all English.\"\n\n\"And your father?\"\n\n\"He was Swiss.\"\n\n\"What besides? What was his profession?\"\n\n\"Ecclesiastic--pastor--he had a church.\"\n\n\"Since your mother is an Englishwoman, why do you not speak English with\nmore facility?\"\n\n\"Maman est morte, il y a dix ans.\"\n\n\"And you do homage to her memory by forgetting her language. Have the\ngoodness to put French out of your mind so long as I converse with\nyou--keep to English.\"\n\n\"C'est si difficile, monsieur, quand on n'en a plus l'habitude.\"\n\n\"You had the habitude formerly, I suppose? Now answer me in your mother\ntongue.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I spoke the English more than the French when I was a child.\"\n\n\"Why do you not speak it now?\"\n\n\"Because I have no English friends.\"\n\n\"You live with your father, I suppose?\"\n\n\"My father is dead.\"\n\n\"You have brothers and sisters?\"\n\n\"Not one.\"\n\n\"Do you live alone?\"\n\n\"No--I have an aunt--ma tante Julienne.\"\n\n\"Your father's sister?\"\n\n\"Justement, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is that English?\"\n\n\"No--but I forget--\"\n\n\"For which, mademoiselle, if you were a child I should certainly devise\nsome slight punishment; at your age--you must be two or three and\ntwenty, I should think?\"\n\n\"Pas encore, monsieur--en un mois j'aurai dix-neuf ans.\"\n\n\"Well, nineteen is a mature age, and, having attained it, you ought to\nbe so solicitous for your own improvement, that it should not be needful\nfor a master to remind you twice of the expediency of your speaking\nEnglish whenever practicable.\"\n\nTo this wise speech I received no answer; and, when I looked up, my\npupil was smiling to herself a much-meaning, though not very gay smile;\nit seemed to say, \"He talks of he knows not what:\" it said this\nso plainly, that I determined to request information on the point\nconcerning which my ignorance seemed to be thus tacitly affirmed.\n\n\"Are you solicitous for your own improvement?\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\n\"How do you prove it, mademoiselle?\"\n\nAn odd question, and bluntly put; it excited a second smile.\n\n\"Why, monsieur, I am not inattentive--am I? I learn my lessons well--\"\n\n\"Oh, a child can do that! and what more do you do?\"\n\n\"What more can I do?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly, not much; but you are a teacher, are you not, as well as\na pupil?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You teach lace-mending?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A dull, stupid occupation; do you like it?\"\n\n\"No--it is tedious.\"\n\n\"Why do you pursue it? Why do you not rather teach history, geography,\ngrammar, even arithmetic?\"\n\n\"Is monsieur certain that I am myself thoroughly acquainted with these\nstudies?\"\n\n\"I don't know; you ought to be at your age.\"\n\n\"But I never was at school, monsieur--\"\n\n\"Indeed! What then were your friends--what was your aunt about? She is\nvery much to blame.\"\n\n\"No monsieur, no--my aunt is good--she is not to blame--she does what\nshe can; she lodges and nourishes me\" (I report Mdlle. Henri's phrases\nliterally, and it was thus she translated from the French). \"She is not\nrich; she has only an annuity of twelve hundred francs, and it would be\nimpossible for her to send me to school.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" thought I to myself on hearing this, but I continued, in the\ndogmatical tone I had adopted:--\n\n\"It is sad, however, that you should be brought up in ignorance of the\nmost ordinary branches of education; had you known something of history\nand grammar you might, by degrees, have relinquished your lace-mending\ndrudgery, and risen in the world.\"\n\n\"It is what I mean to do.\"\n\n\"How? By a knowledge of English alone? That will not suffice; no\nrespectable family will receive a governess whose whole stock of\nknowledge consists in a familiarity with one foreign language.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I know other things.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you can work with Berlin wools, and embroider handkerchiefs\nand collars--that will do little for you.\"\n\nMdlle. Henri's lips were unclosed to answer, but she checked herself,\nas thinking the discussion had been sufficiently pursued, and remained\nsilent.\n\n\"Speak,\" I continued, impatiently; \"I never like the appearance of\nacquiescence when the reality is not there; and you had a contradiction\nat your tongue's end.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I have had many lessons both in grammar, history, geography,\nand arithmetic. I have gone through a course of each study.\"\n\n\"Bravo! but how did you manage it, since your aunt could not afford to\nsend you to school?\"\n\n\"By lace-mending; by the thing monsieur despises so much.\"\n\n\"Truly! And now, mademoiselle, it will be a good exercise for you to\nexplain to me in English how such a result was produced by such means.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I begged my aunt to have me taught lace-mending soon after\nwe came to Brussels, because I knew it was a METIER, a trade which was\neasily learnt, and by which I could earn some money very soon. I learnt\nit in a few days, and I quickly got work, for all the Brussels ladies\nhave old lace--very precious--which must be mended all the times it is\nwashed. I earned money a little, and this money I grave for lessons\nin the studies I have mentioned; some of it I spent in buying books,\nEnglish books especially; soon I shall try to find a place of governess,\nor school-teacher, when I can write and speak English well; but it will\nbe difficult, because those who know I have been a lace-mender will\ndespise me, as the pupils here despise me. Pourtant j'ai mon projet,\"\nshe added in a lower tone.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I will go and live in England; I will teach French there.\"\n\nThe words were pronounced emphatically. She said \"England\" as you might\nsuppose an Israelite of Moses' days would have said Canaan.\n\n\"Have you a wish to see England?\"\n\n\"Yes, and an intention.\"\n\nAnd here a voice, the voice of the directress, interposed:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Henri, je crois qu'il va pleuvoir; vous feriez bien, ma\nbonne amie, de retourner chez vous tout de suite.\"\n\nIn silence, without a word of thanks for this officious warning, Mdlle.\nHenri collected her books; she moved to me respectfully, endeavoured to\nmove to her superior, though the endeavour was almost a failure, for her\nhead seemed as if it would not bend, and thus departed.\n\nWhere there is one grain of perseverance or wilfulness in the\ncomposition, trifling obstacles are ever known rather to stimulate than\ndiscourage. Mdlle. Reuter might as well have spared herself the trouble\nof giving that intimation about the weather (by-the-by her prediction\nwas falsified by the event--it did not rain that evening). At the close\nof the next lesson I was again at Mdlle. Henri's desk. Thus did I accost\nher:--\n\n\"What is your idea of England, mademoiselle? Why do you wish to go\nthere?\"\n\nAccustomed by this time to the calculated abruptness of my manner, it no\nlonger discomposed or surprised her, and she answered with only so\nmuch of hesitation as was rendered inevitable by the difficulty she\nexperienced in improvising the translation of her thoughts from French\nto English.\n\n\"England is something unique, as I have heard and read; my idea of it is\nvague, and I want to go there to render my idea clear, definite.\"\n\n\"Hum! How much of England do you suppose you could see if you went there\nin the capacity of a teacher? A strange notion you must have of getting\na clear and definite idea of a country! All you could see of Great\nBritain would be the interior of a school, or at most of one or two\nprivate dwellings.\"\n\n\"It would be an English school; they would be English dwellings.\"\n\n\"Indisputably; but what then? What would be the value of observations\nmade on a scale so narrow?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, might not one learn something by analogy?\nAn--echantillon--a--a sample often serves to give an idea of the whole;\nbesides, narrow and wide are words comparative, are they not? All my\nlife would perhaps seem narrow in your eyes--all the life of a--that\nlittle animal subterranean--une taupe--comment dit-on?\"\n\n\"Mole.\"\n\n\"Yes--a mole, which lives underground would seem narrow even to me.\"\n\n\"Well, mademoiselle--what then? Proceed.\"\n\n\"Mais, monsieur, vous me comprenez.\"\n\n\"Not in the least; have the goodness to explain.\"\n\n\"Why, monsieur, it is just so. In Switzerland I have done but little,\nlearnt but little, and seen but little; my life there was in a circle;\nI walked the same round every day; I could not get out of it; had I\nrested--remained there even till my death, I should never have enlarged\nit, because I am poor and not skilful, I have not great acquirements;\nwhen I was quite tired of this round, I begged my aunt to go to\nBrussels; my existence is no larger here, because I am no richer or\nhigher; I walk in as narrow a limit, but the scene is changed; it would\nchange again if I went to England. I knew something of the bourgeois of\nGeneva, now I know something of the bourgeois of Brussels; if I went to\nLondon, I would know something of the bourgeois of London. Can you make\nany sense out of what I say, monsieur, or is it all obscure?\"\n\n\"I see, I see--now let us advert to another subject; you propose to\ndevote your life to teaching, and you are a most unsuccessful teacher;\nyou cannot keep your pupils in order.\"\n\nA flush of painful confusion was the result of this harsh remark; she\nbent her head to the desk, but soon raising it replied--\n\n\"Monsieur, I am not a skilful teacher, it is true, but practice\nimproves; besides, I work under difficulties; here I only teach sewing,\nI can show no power in sewing, no superiority--it is a subordinate\nart; then I have no associates in this house, I am isolated; I am too a\nheretic, which deprives me of influence.\"\n\n\"And in England you would be a foreigner; that too would deprive you\nof influence, and would effectually separate you from all round you; in\nEngland you would have as few connections, as little importance as you\nhave here.\"\n\n\"But I should be learning something; for the rest, there are probably\ndifficulties for such as I everywhere, and if I must contend, and\nperhaps be conquered, I would rather submit to English pride than to\nFlemish coarseness; besides, monsieur--\"\n\nShe stopped--not evidently from any difficulty in finding words to\nexpress herself, but because discretion seemed to say, \"You have said\nenough.\"\n\n\"Finish your phrase,\" I urged.\n\n\"Besides, monsieur, I long to live once more among Protestants; they are\nmore honest than Catholics; a Romish school is a building with porous\nwalls, a hollow floor, a false ceiling; every room in this house,\nmonsieur, has eyeholes and ear-holes, and what the house is, the\ninhabitants are, very treacherous; they all think it lawful to tell\nlies; they all call it politeness to profess friendship where they feel\nhatred.\"\n\n\"All?\" said I; \"you mean the pupils--the mere children--inexperienced,\ngiddy things, who have not learnt to distinguish the difference between\nright and wrong?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, monsieur--the children are the most sincere; they have\nnot yet had time to become accomplished in duplicity; they will tell\nlies, but they do it inartificially, and you know they are lying; but\nthe grown-up people are very false; they deceive strangers, they deceive\neach other--\"\n\nA servant here entered:--\n\n\"Mdlle. Henri--Mdlle. Reuter vous prie de vouloir bien conduire la\npetite de Dorlodot chez elle, elle vous attend dans le cabinet\nde Rosalie la portiere--c'est que sa bonne n'est pas venue la\nchercher--voyez-vous.\"\n\n\"Eh bien! est-ce que je suis sa bonne--moi?\" demanded Mdlle. Henri; then\nsmiling, with that same bitter, derisive smile I had seen on her lips\nonce before, she hastily rose and made her exit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE young Anglo-Swiss evidently derived both pleasure and profit from\nthe study of her mother-tongue. In teaching her I did not, of course,\nconfine myself to the ordinary school routine; I made instruction in\nEnglish a channel for instruction in literature. I prescribed to her a\ncourse of reading; she had a little selection of English classics, a\nfew of which had been left her by her mother, and the others she had\npurchased with her own penny-fee. I lent her some more modern works; all\nthese she read with avidity, giving me, in writing, a clear summary of\neach work when she had perused it. Composition, too, she delighted in.\nSuch occupation seemed the very breath of her nostrils, and soon her\nimproved productions wrung from me the avowal that those qualities in\nher I had termed taste and fancy ought rather to have been denominated\njudgment and imagination. When I intimated so much, which I did as usual\nin dry and stinted phrase, I looked for the radiant and exulting smile\nmy one word of eulogy had elicited before; but Frances coloured. If she\ndid smile, it was very softly and shyly; and instead of looking up to me\nwith a conquering glance, her eyes rested on my hand, which, stretched\nover her shoulder, was writing some directions with a pencil on the\nmargin of her book.\n\n\"Well, are you pleased that I am satisfied with your progress?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she slowly, gently, the blush that had half subsided\nreturning.\n\n\"But I do not say enough, I suppose?\" I continued. \"My praises are too\ncool?\"\n\nShe made no answer, and, I thought, looked a little sad. I divined her\nthoughts, and should much have liked to have responded to them, had\nit been expedient so to do. She was not now very ambitious of\nmy admiration--not eagerly desirous of dazzling me; a little\naffection--ever so little--pleased her better than all the panegyrics in\nthe world. Feeling this, I stood a good while behind her, writing on\nthe margin of her book. I could hardly quit my station or relinquish my\noccupation; something retained me bending there, my head very near\nhers, and my hand near hers too; but the margin of a copy-book is not an\nillimitable space--so, doubtless, the directress thought; and she took\noccasion to walk past in order to ascertain by what art I prolonged so\ndisproportionately the period necessary for filling it. I was obliged to\ngo. Distasteful effort--to leave what we most prefer!\n\nFrances did not become pale or feeble in consequence of her sedentary\nemployment; perhaps the stimulus it communicated to her mind\ncounterbalanced the inaction it imposed on her body. She changed,\nindeed, changed obviously and rapidly; but it was for the better. When\nI first saw her, her countenance was sunless, her complexion colourless;\nshe looked like one who had no source of enjoyment, no store of bliss\nanywhere in the world; now the cloud had passed from her mien, leaving\nspace for the dawn of hope and interest, and those feelings rose like a\nclear morning, animating what had been depressed, tinting what had been\npale. Her eyes, whose colour I had not at first known, so dim were they\nwith repressed tears, so shadowed with ceaseless dejection, now, lit by\na ray of the sunshine that cheered her heart, revealed irids of bright\nhazel--irids large and full, screened with long lashes; and pupils\ninstinct with fire. That look of wan emaciation which anxiety or low\nspirits often communicates to a thoughtful, thin face, rather long than\nround, having vanished from hers, a clearness of skin almost bloom,\nand a plumpness almost embonpoint, softened the decided lines of\nher features. Her figure shared in this beneficial change; it became\nrounder, and as the harmony of her form was complete and her stature of\nthe graceful middle height, one did not regret (or at least I did not\nregret) the absence of confirmed fulness, in contours, still slight,\nthough compact, elegant, flexible--the exquisite turning of waist,\nwrist, hand, foot, and ankle satisfied completely my notions of\nsymmetry, and allowed a lightness and freedom of movement which\ncorresponded with my ideas of grace.\n\nThus improved, thus wakened to life, Mdlle. Henri began to take a\nnew footing in the school; her mental power, manifested gradually but\nsteadily, ere long extorted recognition even from the envious; and when\nthe young and healthy saw that she could smile brightly, converse gaily,\nmove with vivacity and alertness, they acknowledged in her a sisterhood\nof youth and health, and tolerated her as of their kind accordingly.\n\nTo speak truth, I watched this change much as a gardener watches the\ngrowth of a precious plant, and I contributed to it too, even as the\nsaid gardener contributes to the development of his favourite. To me it\nwas not difficult to discover how I could best foster my pupil, cherish\nher starved feelings, and induce the outward manifestation of that\ninward vigour which sunless drought and blighting blast had hitherto\nforbidden to expand. Constancy of attention--a kindness as mute\nas watchful, always standing by her, cloaked in the rough garb of\nausterity, and making its real nature known only by a rare glance of\ninterest, or a cordial and gentle word; real respect masked with seeming\nimperiousness, directing, urging her actions, yet helping her too, and\nthat with devoted care: these were the means I used, for these means\nbest suited Frances' feelings, as susceptible as deep vibrating--her\nnature at once proud and shy.\n\nThe benefits of my system became apparent also in her altered demeanour\nas a teacher; she now took her place amongst her pupils with an air\nof spirit and firmness which assured them at once that she meant to be\nobeyed--and obeyed she was. They felt they had lost their power over\nher. If any girl had rebelled, she would no longer have taken her\nrebellion to heart; she possessed a source of comfort they could not\ndrain, a pillar of support they could not overthrow: formerly, when\ninsulted, she wept; now, she smiled.\n\nThe public reading of one of her devoirs achieved the revelation of her\ntalents to all and sundry; I remember the subject--it was an emigrant's\nletter to his friends at home. It opened with simplicity; some natural\nand graphic touches disclosed to the reader the scene of virgin forest\nand great, New-World river--barren of sail and flag--amidst which the\nepistle was supposed to be indited. The difficulties and dangers that\nattend a settler's life, were hinted at; and in the few words said on\nthat subject, Mdlle. Henri failed not to render audible the voice of\nresolve, patience, endeavour. The disasters which had driven him\nfrom his native country were alluded to; stainless honour, inflexible\nindependence, indestructible self-respect there took the word. Past\ndays were spoken of; the grief of parting, the regrets of absence, were\ntouched upon; feeling, forcible and fine, breathed eloquent in every\nperiod. At the close, consolation was suggested; religious faith became\nthere the speaker, and she spoke well.\n\nThe devoir was powerfully written in language at once chaste and choice,\nin a style nerved with vigour and graced with harmony.\n\nMdlle. Reuter was quite sufficiently acquainted with English to\nunderstand it when read or spoken in her presence, though she could\nneither speak nor write it herself. During the perusal of this devoir,\nshe sat placidly busy, her eyes and fingers occupied with the formation\nof a \"riviere\" or open-work hem round a cambric handkerchief; she\nsaid nothing, and her face and forehead, clothed with a mask of purely\nnegative expression, were as blank of comment as her lips. As neither\nsurprise, pleasure, approbation, nor interest were evinced in her\ncountenance, so no more were disdain, envy, annoyance, weariness; if\nthat inscrutable mien said anything, it was simply this--\n\n\"The matter is too trite to excite an emotion, or call forth an\nopinion.\"\n\nAs soon as I had done, a hum rose; several of the pupils, pressing round\nMdlle. Henri, began to beset her with compliments; the composed voice of\nthe directress was now heard:--\n\n\"Young ladies, such of you as have cloaks and umbrellas will hasten\nto return home before the shower becomes heavier\" (it was raining a\nlittle), \"the remainder will wait till their respective servants arrive\nto fetch them.\" And the school dispersed, for it was four o'clock.\n\n\"Monsieur, a word,\" said Mdlle. Reuter, stepping on to the estrade, and\nsignifying, by a movement of the hand, that she wished me to relinquish,\nfor an instant, the castor I had clutched.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I am at your service.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, it is of course an excellent plan to encourage effort in\nyoung people by making conspicuous the progress of any particularly\nindustrious pupil; but do you not think that in the present instance,\nMdlle. Henri can hardly be considered as a concurrent with the other\npupils? She is older than most of them, and has had advantages of an\nexclusive nature for acquiring a knowledge of English; on the other\nhand, her sphere of life is somewhat beneath theirs; under these\ncircumstances, a public distinction, conferred upon Mdlle. Henri, may be\nthe means of suggesting comparisons, and exciting feelings such as would\nbe far from advantageous to the individual forming their object. The\ninterest I take in Mdlle. Henri's real welfare makes me desirous of\nscreening her from annoyances of this sort; besides, monsieur, as I\nhave before hinted to you, the sentiment of AMOUR-PROPRE has a somewhat\nmarked preponderance in her character; celebrity has a tendency to\nfoster this sentiment, and in her it should be rather repressed--she\nrather needs keeping down than bringing forward; and then I think,\nmonsieur--it appears to me that ambition, LITERARY ambition especially,\nis not a feeling to be cherished in the mind of a woman: would not\nMdlle. Henri be much safer and happier if taught to believe that in the\nquiet discharge of social duties consists her real vocation, than if\nstimulated to aspire after applause and publicity? She may never marry;\nscanty as are her resources, obscure as are her connections, uncertain\nas is her health (for I think her consumptive, her mother died of that\ncomplaint), it is more than probable she never will. I do not see how\nshe can rise to a position, whence such a step would be possible; but\neven in celibacy it would be better for her to retain the character and\nhabits of a respectable decorous female.\"\n\n\"Indisputably, mademoiselle,\" was my answer. \"Your opinion admits of no\ndoubt;\" and, fearful of the harangue being renewed, I retreated under\ncover of that cordial sentence of assent.\n\nAt the date of a fortnight after the little incident noted above, I find\nit recorded in my diary that a hiatus occurred in Mdlle. Henri's usually\nregular attendance in class. The first day or two I wondered at her\nabsence, but did not like to ask an explanation of it; I thought indeed\nsome chance word might be dropped which would afford me the information\nI wished to obtain, without my running the risk of exciting silly smiles\nand gossiping whispers by demanding it. But when a week passed and\nthe seat at the desk near the door still remained vacant, and when\nno allusion was made to the circumstance by any individual of the\nclass--when, on the contrary, I found that all observed a marked silence\non the point--I determined, COUTE QUI COUTE, to break the ice of this\nsilly reserve. I selected Sylvie as my informant, because from her I\nknew that I should at least get a sensible answer, unaccompanied by\nwriggle, titter, or other flourish of folly.\n\n\"Ou donc est Mdlle. Henri?\" I said one day as I returned an\nexercise-book I had been examining.\n\n\"Elle est partie, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Partie? et pour combien de temps? Quand reviendra-t-elle?\"\n\n\"Elle est partie pour toujours, monsieur; elle ne reviendra plus.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" was my involuntary exclamation; then after a pause:--\n\n\"En etes-vous bien sure, Sylvie?\"\n\n\"Oui, oui, monsieur, mademoiselle la directrice nous l'a dit elle-meme\nil y a deux ou trois jours.\"\n\nAnd I could pursue my inquiries no further; time, place, and\ncircumstances forbade my adding another word. I could neither comment on\nwhat had been said, nor demand further particulars. A question as to the\nreason of the teacher's departure, as to whether it had been voluntary\nor otherwise, was indeed on my lips, but I suppressed it--there were\nlisteners all round. An hour after, in passing Sylvie in the corridor as\nshe was putting on her bonnet, I stopped short and asked:--\n\n\"Sylvie, do you know Mdlle. Henri's address? I have some books of hers,\"\nI added carelessly, \"and I should wish to send them to her.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" replied Sylvie; \"but perhaps Rosalie, the portress, will\nbe able to give it you.\"\n\nRosalie's cabinet was just at hand; I stepped in and repeated the\ninquiry. Rosalie--a smart French grisette--looked up from her work with\na knowing smile, precisely the sort of smile I had been so desirous to\navoid exciting. Her answer was prepared; she knew nothing whatever\nof Mdlle. Henri's address--had never known it. Turning from her with\nimpatience--for I believed she lied and was hired to lie--I almost\nknocked down some one who had been standing at my back; it was the\ndirectress. My abrupt movement made her recoil two or three steps. I was\nobliged to apologize, which I did more concisely than politely. No man\nlikes to be dogged, and in the very irritable mood in which I then\nwas the sight of Mdlle. Reuter thoroughly incensed me. At the moment I\nturned her countenance looked hard, dark, and inquisitive; her eyes\nwere bent upon me with an expression of almost hungry curiosity. I had\nscarcely caught this phase of physiognomy ere it had vanished; a\nbland smile played on her features; my harsh apology was received with\ngood-humoured facility.\n\n\"Oh, don't mention it, monsieur; you only touched my hair with your\nelbow; it is no worse, only a little dishevelled.\" She shook it back,\nand passing her fingers through her curls, loosened them into more\nnumerous and flowing ringlets. Then she went on with vivacity:\n\n\"Rosalie, I was coming to tell you to go instantly and close the windows\nof the salon; the wind is rising, and the muslin curtains will be\ncovered with dust.\"\n\nRosalie departed. \"Now,\" thought I, \"this will not do; Mdlle. Reuter\nthinks her meanness in eaves-dropping is screened by her art in devising\na pretext, whereas the muslin curtains she speaks of are not more\ntransparent than this same pretext.\" An impulse came over me to thrust\nthe flimsy screen aside, and confront her craft boldly with a word or\ntwo of plain truth. \"The rough-shod foot treads most firmly on slippery\nground,\" thought I; so I began:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Henri has left your establishment--been dismissed, I\npresume?\"\n\n\"Ah, I wished to have a little conversation with you, monsieur,\" replied\nthe directress with the most natural and affable air in the world;\n\"but we cannot talk quietly here; will Monsieur step into the garden a\nminute?\" And she preceded me, stepping out through the glass-door I have\nbefore mentioned.\n\n\"There,\" said she, when we had reached the centre of the middle alley,\nand when the foliage of shrubs and trees, now in their summer pride,\nclosing behind end around us, shut out the view of the house, and thus\nimparted a sense of seclusion even to this little plot of ground in the\nvery core of a capital.\n\n\"There, one feels quiet and free when there are only pear-trees and\nrose-bushes about one; I dare say you, like me, monsieur, are sometimes\ntired of being eternally in the midst of life; of having human faces\nalways round you, human eyes always upon you, human voices always in\nyour ear. I am sure I often wish intensely for liberty to spend a whole\nmonth in the country at some little farm-house, bien gentille, bien\npropre, tout entouree de champs et de bois; quelle vie charmante que la\nvie champetre! N'est-ce pas, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Cela depend, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Que le vent est bon et frais!\" continued the directress; and she was\nright there, for it was a south wind, soft and sweet. I carried my hat\nin my hand, and this gentle breeze, passing through my hair, soothed my\ntemples like balm. Its refreshing effect, however, penetrated no deeper\nthan the mere surface of the frame; for as I walked by the side of\nMdlle. Reuter, my heart was still hot within me, and while I was musing\nthe fire burned; then spake I with my tongue:--\n\n\"I understand Mdlle. Henri is gone from hence, and will not return?\"\n\n\"Ah, true! I meant to have named the subject to you some days ago, but\nmy time is so completely taken up, I cannot do half the things I wish:\nhave you never experienced what it is, monsieur, to find the day too\nshort by twelve hours for your numerous duties?\"\n\n\"Not often. Mdlle. Henri's departure was not voluntary, I presume? If it\nhad been, she would certainly have given me some intimation of it, being\nmy pupil.\"\n\n\"Oh, did she not tell you? that was strange; for my part, I never\nthought of adverting to the subject; when one has so many things to\nattend to, one is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary\nimportance.\"\n\n\"You consider Mdlle. Henri's dismission, then, as a very insignificant\nevent?\"\n\n\"Dismission? Ah! she was not dismissed; I can say with truth, monsieur,\nthat since I became the head of this establishment no master or teacher\nhas ever been dismissed from it.\"\n\n\"Yet some have left it, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Many; I have found it necessary to change frequently--a change of\ninstructors is often beneficial to the interests of a school; it gives\nlife and variety to the proceedings; it amuses the pupils, and suggests\nto the parents the idea of exertion and progress.\"\n\n\"Yet when you are tired of a professor or maitresse, you scruple to\ndismiss them?\"\n\n\"No need to have recourse to such extreme measures, I assure you.\nAllons, monsieur le professeur--asseyons-nous; je vais vous donner une\npetite lecon dans votre etat d'instituteur.\" (I wish I might write\nall she said to me in French--it loses sadly by being translated into\nEnglish.) We had now reached THE garden-chair; the directress sat down,\nand signed to me to sit by her, but I only rested my knee on the seat,\nand stood leaning my head and arm against the embowering branch of a\nhuge laburnum, whose golden flowers, blent with the dusky green leaves\nof a lilac-bush, formed a mixed arch of shade and sunshine over the\nretreat. Mdlle. Reuter sat silent a moment; some novel movements were\nevidently working in her mind, and they showed their nature on her\nastute brow; she was meditating some CHEF D'OEUVRE of policy. Convinced\nby several months' experience that the affectation of virtues she did\nnot possess was unavailing to ensnare me--aware that I had read her real\nnature, and would believe nothing of the character she gave out as being\nhers--she had determined, at last, to try a new key, and see if the lock\nof my heart would yield to that; a little audacity, a word of truth, a\nglimpse of the real. \"Yes, I will try,\" was her inward resolve; and then\nher blue eye glittered upon me--it did not flash--nothing of flame ever\nkindled in its temperate gleam.\n\n\"Monsieur fears to sit by me?\" she inquired playfully.\n\n\"I have no wish to usurp Pelet's place,\" I answered, for I had got the\nhabit of speaking to her bluntly--a habit begun in anger, but continued\nbecause I saw that, instead of offending, it fascinated her. She cast\ndown her eyes, and drooped her eyelids; she sighed uneasily; she turned\nwith an anxious gesture, as if she would give me the idea of a bird that\nflutters in its cage, and would fain fly from its jail and jailer, and\nseek its natural mate and pleasant nest.\n\n\"Well--and your lesson?\" I demanded briefly.\n\n\"Ah!\" she exclaimed, recovering herself, \"you are so young, so frank\nand fearless, so talented, so impatient of imbecility, so disdainful of\nvulgarity, you need a lesson; here it is then: far more is to be done\nin this world by dexterity than by strength; but, perhaps, you knew\nthat before, for there is delicacy as well as power in your\ncharacter--policy, as well as pride?\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said I; and I could hardly help smiling, the flattery was so\npiquant, so finely seasoned. She caught the prohibited smile, though I\npassed my hand over my month to conceal it; and again she made room for\nme to sit beside her. I shook my head, though temptation penetrated to\nmy senses at the moment, and once more I told her to go on.\n\n\"Well, then, if ever you are at the head of a large establishment,\ndismiss nobody. To speak truth, monsieur (and to you I will speak\ntruth), I despise people who are always making rows, blustering, sending\noff one to the right, and another to the left, urging and hurrying\ncircumstances. I'll tell you what I like best to do, monsieur, shall I?\"\nShe looked up again; she had compounded her glance well this time--much\narchness, more deference, a spicy dash of coquetry, an unveiled\nconsciousness of capacity. I nodded; she treated me like the great\nMogul; so I became the great Mogul as far as she was concerned.\n\n\"I like, monsieur, to take my knitting in my hands, and to sit quietly\ndown in my chair; circumstances defile past me; I watch their march; so\nlong as they follow the course I wish, I say nothing, and do nothing; I\ndon't clap my hands, and cry out 'Bravo! How lucky I am!' to attract\nthe attention and envy of my neighbours--I am merely passive; but when\nevents fall out ill--when circumstances become adverse--I watch very\nvigilantly; I knit on still, and still I hold my tongue; but every now\nand then, monsieur, I just put my toe out--so--and give the rebellious\ncircumstance a little secret push, without noise, which sends it the way\nI wish, and I am successful after all, and nobody has seen my expedient.\nSo, when teachers or masters become troublesome and inefficient--when,\nin short, the interests of the school would suffer from their retaining\ntheir places--I mind my knitting, events progress, circumstances glide\npast; I see one which, if pushed ever so little awry, will render\nuntenable the post I wish to have vacated--the deed is done--the\nstumbling-block removed--and no one saw me: I have not made an enemy, I\nam rid of an incumbrance.\"\n\nA moment since, and I thought her alluring; this speech concluded, I\nlooked on her with distaste. \"Just like you,\" was my cold answer.\n\"And in this way you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? You wanted her office,\ntherefore you rendered it intolerable to her?\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur, I was merely anxious about Mdlle. Henri's health;\nno, your moral sight is clear and piercing, but there you have failed\nto discover the truth. I took--I have always taken a real interest in\nMdlle. Henri's welfare; I did not like her going out in all weathers;\nI thought it would be more advantageous for her to obtain a permanent\nsituation; besides, I considered her now qualified to do something more\nthan teach sewing. I reasoned with her; left the decision to herself;\nshe saw the correctness of my views, and adopted them.\"\n\n\"Excellent! and now, mademoiselle, you will have the goodness to give me\nher address.\"\n\n\"Her address!\" and a sombre and stony change came over the mien of\nthe directress. \"Her address? Ah?--well--I wish I could oblige you,\nmonsieur, but I cannot, and I will tell you why; whenever I myself asked\nher for her address, she always evaded the inquiry. I thought--I may\nbe wrong--but I THOUGHT her motive for doing so, was a natural, though\nmistaken reluctance to introduce me to some, probably, very poor\nabode; her means were narrow, her origin obscure; she lives somewhere,\ndoubtless, in the 'basse ville.'\"\n\n\"I'll not lose sight of my best pupil yet,\" said I, \"though she were\nborn of beggars and lodged in a cellar; for the rest, it is absurd to\nmake a bugbear of her origin to me--I happen to know that she was a\nSwiss pastor's daughter, neither more nor less; and, as to her narrow\nmeans, I care nothing for the poverty of her purse so long as her heart\noverflows with affluence.\"\n\n\"Your sentiments are perfectly noble, monsieur,\" said the directress,\naffecting to suppress a yawn; her sprightliness was now extinct, her\ntemporary candour shut up; the little, red-coloured, piratical-looking\npennon of audacity she had allowed to float a minute in the air, was\nfurled, and the broad, sober-hued flag of dissimulation again hung\nlow over the citadel. I did not like her thus, so I cut short the\nTETE-A-TETE and departed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nNOVELISTS should never allow themselves to weary of the study of real\nlife. If they observed this duty conscientiously, they would give us\nfewer pictures chequered with vivid contrasts of light and shade;\nthey would seldom elevate their heroes and heroines to the heights of\nrapture--still seldomer sink them to the depths of despair; for if we\nrarely taste the fulness of joy in this life, we yet more rarely savour\nthe acrid bitterness of hopeless anguish; unless, indeed, we have\nplunged like beasts into sensual indulgence, abused, strained,\nstimulated, again overstrained, and, at last, destroyed our faculties\nfor enjoyment; then, truly, we may find ourselves without support,\nrobbed of hope. Our agony is great, and how can it end? We have broken\nthe spring of our powers; life must be all suffering--too feeble to\nconceive faith--death must be darkness--God, spirits, religion can have\nno place in our collapsed minds, where linger only hideous and polluting\nrecollections of vice; and time brings us on to the brink of the grave,\nand dissolution flings us in--a rag eaten through and through with\ndisease, wrung together with pain, stamped into the churchyard sod by\nthe inexorable heel of despair.\n\nBut the man of regular life and rational mind never despairs. He loses\nhis property--it is a blow--he staggers a moment; then, his energies,\nroused by the smart, are at work to seek a remedy; activity soon\nmitigates regret. Sickness affects him; he takes patience--endures what\nhe cannot cure. Acute pain racks him; his writhing limbs know not where\nto find rest; he leans on Hope's anchors. Death takes from him what\nhe loves; roots up, and tears violently away the stem round which his\naffections were twined--a dark, dismal time, a frightful wrench--but\nsome morning Religion looks into his desolate house with sunrise, and\nsays, that in another world, another life, he shall meet his kindred\nagain. She speaks of that world as a place unsullied by sin--of that\nlife, as an era unembittered by suffering; she mightily strengthens\nher consolation by connecting with it two ideas--which mortals cannot\ncomprehend, but on which they love to repose--Eternity, Immortality; and\nthe mind of the mourner, being filled with an image, faint yet glorious,\nof heavenly hills all light and peace--of a spirit resting there in\nbliss--of a day when his spirit shall also alight there, free and\ndisembodied--of a reunion perfected by love, purified from fear--he\ntakes courage--goes out to encounter the necessities and discharge the\nduties of life; and, though sadness may never lift her burden from his\nmind, Hope will enable him to support it.\n\nWell--and what suggested all this? and what is the inference to be drawn\ntherefrom? What suggested it, is the circumstance of my best pupil--my\ntreasure--being snatched from my hands, and put away out of my reach;\nthe inference to be drawn from it is--that, being a steady, reasonable\nman, I did not allow the resentment, disappointment, and grief,\nengendered in my mind by this evil chance, to grow there to any\nmonstrous size; nor did I allow them to monopolize the whole space of my\nheart; I pent them, on the contrary, in one strait and secret nook. In\nthe daytime, too, when I was about my duties, I put them on the silent\nsystem; and it was only after I had closed the door of my chamber\nat night that I somewhat relaxed my severity towards these morose\nnurslings, and allowed vent to their language of murmurs; then, in\nrevenge, they sat on my pillow, haunted my bed, and kept me awake with\ntheir long, midnight cry.\n\nA week passed. I had said nothing more to Mdlle. Reuter. I had been calm\nin my demeanour to her, though stony cold and hard. When I looked at\nher, it was with the glance fitting to be bestowed on one who I knew\nhad consulted jealousy as an adviser, and employed treachery as an\ninstrument--the glance of quiet disdain and rooted distrust. On Saturday\nevening, ere I left the house, I stept into the SALLE-A-MANGER, where\nshe was sitting alone, and, placing myself before her, I asked, with\nthe same tranquil tone and manner that I should have used had I put the\nquestion for the first time--\n\n\"Mademoiselle, will you have the goodness to give me the address of\nFrances Evans Henri?\"\n\nA little surprised, but not disconcerted, she smilingly disclaimed any\nknowledge of that address, adding, \"Monsieur has perhaps forgotten that\nI explained all about that circumstance before--a week ago?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" I continued, \"you would greatly oblige me by directing\nme to that young person's abode.\"\n\nShe seemed somewhat puzzled; and, at last, looking up with an admirably\ncounterfeited air of naivete, she demanded, \"Does Monsieur think I am\ntelling an untruth?\"\n\nStill avoiding to give her a direct answer, I said, \"It is not then your\nintention, mademoiselle, to oblige me in this particular?\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, how can I tell you what I do not know?\"\n\n\"Very well; I understand you perfectly, mademoiselle, and now I have\nonly two or three words to say. This is the last week in July; in\nanother month the vacation will commence, have the goodness to avail\nyourself of the leisure it will afford you to look out for another\nEnglish master--at the close of August, I shall be under the necessity\nof resigning my post in your establishment.\"\n\nI did not wait for her comments on this announcement, but bowed and\nimmediately withdrew.\n\nThat same evening, soon after dinner, a servant brought me a small\npacket; it was directed in a hand I knew, but had not hoped so soon to\nsee again; being in my own apartment and alone, there was nothing to\nprevent my immediately opening it; it contained four five-franc pieces,\nand a note in English.\n\n\"MONSIEUR,\n\n\"I came to Mdlle. Reuter's house yesterday, at the time when I knew you\nwould be just about finishing your lesson, and I asked if I might go\ninto the schoolroom and speak to you. Mdlle. Reuter came out and said\nyou were already gone; it had not yet struck four, so I thought she must\nbe mistaken, but concluded it would be vain to call another day on the\nsame errand. In one sense a note will do as well--it will wrap up the\n20 francs, the price of the lessons I have received from you; and if it\nwill not fully express the thanks I owe you in addition--if it will not\nbid you good-bye as I could wish to have done--if it will not tell you,\nas I long to do, how sorry I am that I shall probably never see you\nmore--why, spoken words would hardly be more adequate to the task. Had\nI seen you, I should probably have stammered out something feeble and\nunsatisfactory--something belying my feelings rather than explaining\nthem; so it is perhaps as well that I was denied admission to your\npresence. You often remarked, monsieur, that my devoirs dwelt a great\ndeal on fortitude in bearing grief--you said I introduced that theme too\noften: I find indeed that it is much easier to write about a severe duty\nthan to perform it, for I am oppressed when I see and feel to what a\nreverse fate has condemned me; you were kind to me, monsieur--very kind;\nI am afflicted--I am heart-broken to be quite separated from you; soon\nI shall have no friend on earth. But it is useless troubling you with my\ndistresses. What claim have I on your sympathy? None; I will then say no\nmore.\n\n\"Farewell, Monsieur.\n\n\"F. E. HENRI.\"\n\nI put up the note in my pocket-book. I slipped the five-franc pieces\ninto my purse--then I took a turn through my narrow chamber.\n\n\"Mdlle. Reuter talked about her poverty,\" said I, \"and she is poor;\nyet she pays her debts and more. I have not yet given her a quarter's\nlessons, and she has sent me a quarter's due. I wonder of what she\ndeprived herself to scrape together the twenty francs--I wonder what\nsort of a place she has to live in, and what sort of a woman her aunt\nis, and whether she is likely to get employment to supply the place she\nhas lost. No doubt she will have to trudge about long enough from school\nto school, to inquire here, and apply there--be rejected in this place,\ndisappointed in that. Many an evening she'll go to her bed tired\nand unsuccessful. And the directress would not let her in to bid me\ngood-bye? I might not have the chance of standing with her for a few\nminutes at a window in the schoolroom and exchanging some half-dozen of\nsentences--getting to know where she lived--putting matters in train\nfor having all things arranged to my mind? No address on the note\"--I\ncontinued, drawing it again from the pocket-book and examining it on\neach side of the two leaves: \"women are women, that is certain, and\nalways do business like women; men mechanically put a date and address\nto their communications. And these five-franc pieces?\"--(I hauled them\nforth from my purse)--\"if she had offered me them herself instead of\ntying them up with a thread of green silk in a kind of Lilliputian\npacket, I could have thrust them back into her little hand, and shut\nup the small, taper fingers over them--so--and compelled her shame, her\npride, her shyness, all to yield to a little bit of determined Will--now\nwhere is she? How can I get at her?\"\n\nOpening my chamber door I walked down into the kitchen.\n\n\"Who brought the packet?\" I asked of the servant who had delivered it to\nme.\n\n\"Un petit commissionaire, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything?\"\n\n\"Rien.\"\n\nAnd I wended my way up the back-stairs, wondrously the wiser for my\ninquiries.\n\n\"No matter,\" said I to myself, as I again closed the door. \"No\nmatter--I'll seek her through Brussels.\"\n\nAnd I did. I sought her day by day whenever I had a moment's leisure,\nfor four weeks; I sought her on Sundays all day long; I sought her on\nthe Boulevards, in the Allee Verte, in the Park; I sought her in Ste.\nGudule and St. Jacques; I sought her in the two Protestant chapels; I\nattended these latter at the German, French, and English services, not\ndoubting that I should meet her at one of them. All my researches were\nabsolutely fruitless; my security on the last point was proved by the\nevent to be equally groundless with my other calculations. I stood\nat the door of each chapel after the service, and waited till every\nindividual had come out, scrutinizing every gown draping a slender form,\npeering under every bonnet covering a young head. In vain; I saw\ngirlish figures pass me, drawing their black scarfs over their sloping\nshoulders, but none of them had the exact turn and air of Mdlle.\nHenri's; I saw pale and thoughtful faces \"encadrees\" in bands of brown\nhair, but I never found her forehead, her eyes, her eyebrows. All the\nfeatures of all the faces I met seemed frittered away, because my eye\nfailed to recognize the peculiarities it was bent upon; an ample space\nof brow and a large, dark, and serious eye, with a fine but decided line\nof eyebrow traced above.\n\n\"She has probably left Brussels--perhaps is gone to England, as she\nsaid she would,\" muttered I inwardly, as on the afternoon of the fourth\nSunday, I turned from the door of the chapel-royal which the door-keeper\nhad just closed and locked, and followed in the wake of the last of the\ncongregation, now dispersed and dispersing over the square. I had\nsoon outwalked the couples of English gentlemen and ladies. (Gracious\ngoodness! why don't they dress better? My eye is yet filled with visions\nof the high-flounced, slovenly, and tumbled dresses in costly silk and\nsatin, of the large unbecoming collars in expensive lace; of the ill-cut\ncoats and strangely fashioned pantaloons which every Sunday, at the\nEnglish service, filled the choirs of the chapel-royal, and after it,\nissuing forth into the square, came into disadvantageous contrast with\nfreshly and trimly attired foreign figures, hastening to attend salut\nat the church of Coburg.) I had passed these pairs of Britons, and\nthe groups of pretty British children, and the British footmen and\nwaiting-maids; I had crossed the Place Royale, and got into the Rue\nRoyale, thence I had diverged into the Rue de Louvain--an old and quiet\nstreet. I remember that, feeling a little hungry, and not desiring to\ngo back and take my share of the \"gouter,\" now on the refectory-table\nat Pelet's--to wit, pistolets and water--I stepped into a baker's and\nrefreshed myself on a COUC(?)--it is a Flemish word, I don't know how\nto spell it--A CORINTHE-ANGLICE, a currant bun--and a cup of coffee; and\nthen I strolled on towards the Porte de Louvain. Very soon I was out of\nthe city, and slowly mounting the hill, which ascends from the gate, I\ntook my time; for the afternoon, though cloudy, was very sultry, and not\na breeze stirred to refresh the atmosphere. No inhabitant of Brussels\nneed wander far to search for solitude; let him but move half a league\nfrom his own city and he will find her brooding still and blank over\nthe wide fields, so drear though so fertile, spread out treeless and\ntrackless round the capital of Brabant. Having gained the summit of the\nhill, and having stood and looked long over the cultured but lifeless\ncampaign, I felt a wish to quit the high road, which I had hitherto\nfollowed, and get in among those tilled grounds--fertile as the beds\nof a Brobdignagian kitchen-garden--spreading far and wide even to the\nboundaries of the horizon, where, from a dusk green, distance changed\nthem to a sullen blue, and confused their tints with those of the livid\nand thunderous-looking sky. Accordingly I turned up a by-path to the\nright; I had not followed it far ere it brought me, as I expected, into\nthe fields, amidst which, just before me, stretched a long and lofty\nwhite wall enclosing, as it seemed from the foliage showing above, some\nthickly planted nursery of yew and cypress, for of that species were\nthe branches resting on the pale parapets, and crowding gloomily about a\nmassive cross, planted doubtless on a central eminence and extending its\narms, which seemed of black marble, over the summits of those sinister\ntrees. I approached, wondering to what house this well-protected garden\nappertained; I turned the angle of the wall, thinking to see some\nstately residence; I was close upon great iron gates; there was a\nhut serving for a lodge near, but I had no occasion to apply for the\nkey--the gates were open; I pushed one leaf back--rain had rusted\nits hinges, for it groaned dolefully as they revolved. Thick planting\nembowered the entrance. Passing up the avenue, I saw objects on\neach hand which, in their own mute language of inscription and sign,\nexplained clearly to what abode I had made my way. This was the\nhouse appointed for all living; crosses, monuments, and garlands of\neverlastings announced, \"The Protestant Cemetery, outside the gate of\nLouvain.\"\n\nThe place was large enough to afford half an hour's strolling without\nthe monotony of treading continually the same path; and, for those who\nlove to peruse the annals of graveyards, here was variety of inscription\nenough to occupy the attention for double or treble that space of time.\nHither people of many kindreds, tongues, and nations, had brought their\ndead for interment; and here, on pages of stone, of marble, and of\nbrass, were written names, dates, last tributes of pomp or love, in\nEnglish, in French, in German, and Latin. Here the Englishman had\nerected a marble monument over the remains of his Mary Smith or Jane\nBrown, and inscribed it only with her name. There the French widower had\nshaded the grave of his Elmire or Celestine with a brilliant thicket\nof roses, amidst which a little tablet rising, bore an equally bright\ntestimony to her countless virtues. Every nation, tribe, and kindred,\nmourned after its own fashion; and how soundless was the mourning of\nall! My own tread, though slow and upon smooth-rolled paths, seemed to\nstartle, because it formed the sole break to a silence otherwise total.\nNot only the winds, but the very fitful, wandering airs, were that\nafternoon, as by common consent, all fallen asleep in their various\nquarters; the north was hushed, the south silent, the east sobbed not,\nnor did the west whisper. The clouds in heaven were condensed and\ndull, but apparently quite motionless. Under the trees of this cemetery\nnestled a warm breathless gloom, out of which the cypresses stood up\nstraight and mute, above which the willows hung low and still; where\nthe flowers, as languid as fair, waited listless for night dew or\nthunder-shower; where the tombs, and those they hid, lay impassible to\nsun or shadow, to rain or drought.\n\nImportuned by the sound of my own footsteps, I turned off upon the turf,\nand slowly advanced to a grove of yews; I saw something stir among the\nstems; I thought it might be a broken branch swinging, my short-sighted\nvision had caught no form, only a sense of motion; but the dusky shade\npassed on, appearing and disappearing at the openings in the avenue. I\nsoon discerned it was a living thing, and a human thing; and, drawing\nnearer, I perceived it was a woman, pacing slowly to and fro, and\nevidently deeming herself alone as I had deemed myself alone, and\nmeditating as I had been meditating. Ere long she returned to a seat\nwhich I fancy she had but just quitted, or I should have caught sight\nof her before. It was in a nook, screened by a clump of trees; there was\nthe white wall before her, and a little stone set up against the wall,\nand, at the foot of the stone, was an allotment of turf freshly turned\nup, a new-made grave. I put on my spectacles, and passed softly close\nbehind her; glancing at the inscription on the stone, I read, \"Julienne\nHenri, died at Brussels, aged sixty. August 10th, 18--.\" Having perused\nthe inscription, I looked down at the form sitting bent and thoughtful\njust under my eyes, unconscious of the vicinity of any living thing; it\nwas a slim, youthful figure in mourning apparel of the plainest black\nstuff, with a little simple, black crape bonnet; I felt, as well as\nsaw, who it was; and, moving neither hand nor foot, I stood some moments\nenjoying the security of conviction. I had sought her for a month, and\nhad never discovered one of her traces--never met a hope, or seized\na chance of encountering her anywhere. I had been forced to loosen my\ngrasp on expectation; and, but an hour ago, had sunk slackly under\nthe discouraging thought that the current of life, and the impulse\nof destiny, had swept her for ever from my reach; and, behold, while\nbending suddenly earthward beneath the pressure of despondency--while\nfollowing with my eyes the track of sorrow on the turf of a\ngraveyard--here was my lost jewel dropped on the tear-fed herbage,\nnestling in the messy and mouldy roots of yew-trees.\n\nFrances sat very quiet, her elbow on her knee, and her head on her hand.\nI knew she could retain a thinking attitude a long time without change;\nat last, a tear fell; she had been looking at the name on the\nstone before her, and her heart had no doubt endured one of those\nconstrictions with which the desolate living, regretting the dead, are,\nat times, so sorely oppressed. Many tears rolled down, which she wiped\naway, again and again, with her handkerchief; some distressed sobs\nescaped her, and then, the paroxysm over, she sat quiet as before. I put\nmy hand gently on her shoulder; no need further to prepare her, for\nshe was neither hysterical nor liable to fainting-fits; a sudden push,\nindeed, might have startled her, but the contact of my quiet touch\nmerely woke attention as I wished; and, though she turned quickly, yet\nso lightning-swift is thought--in some minds especially--I believe the\nwonder of what--the consciousness of who it was that thus stole unawares\non her solitude, had passed through her brain, and flashed into her\nheart, even before she had effected that hasty movement; at least,\nAmazement had hardly opened her eyes and raised them to mine, ere\nRecognition informed their irids with most speaking brightness. Nervous\nsurprise had hardly discomposed her features ere a sentiment of most\nvivid joy shone clear and warm on her whole countenance. I had hardly\ntime to observe that she was wasted and pale, ere called to feel a\nresponsive inward pleasure by the sense of most full and exquisite\npleasure glowing in the animated flush, and shining in the expansive\nlight, now diffused over my pupil's face. It was the summer sun flashing\nout after the heavy summer shower; and what fertilizes more rapidly than\nthat beam, burning almost like fire in its ardour?\n\nI hate boldness--that boldness which is of the brassy brow and insensate\nnerves; but I love the courage of the strong heart, the fervour of the\ngenerous blood; I loved with passion the light of Frances Evans' clear\nhazel eye when it did not fear to look straight into mine; I loved the\ntones with which she uttered the words--\n\n\"Mon maitre! mon maitre!\"\n\nI loved the movement with which she confided her hand to my hand; I\nloved her as she stood there, penniless and parentless; for a sensualist\ncharmless, for me a treasure--my best object of sympathy on earth,\nthinking such thoughts as I thought, feeling such feelings as I felt; my\nideal of the shrine in which to seal my stores of love; personification\nof discretion and forethought, of diligence and perseverance, of\nself-denial and self-control--those guardians, those trusty keepers of\nthe gift I longed to confer on her--the gift of all my affections;\nmodel of truth and honour, of independence and conscientiousness--those\nrefiners and sustainers of an honest life; silent possessor of a well\nof tenderness, of a flame, as genial as still, as pure as quenchless,\nof natural feeling, natural passion--those sources of refreshment and\ncomfort to the sanctuary of home. I knew how quietly and how deeply the\nwell bubbled in her heart; I knew how the more dangerous flame burned\nsafely under the eye of reason; I had seen when the fire shot up a\nmoment high and vivid, when the accelerated heat troubled life's current\nin its channels; I had seen reason reduce the rebel, and humble its\nblaze to embers. I had confidence in Frances Evans; I had respect\nfor her, and as I drew her arm through mine, and led her out of the\ncemetery, I felt I had another sentiment, as strong as confidence, as\nfirm as respect, more fervid than either--that of love.\n\n\"Well, my pupil,\" said I, as the ominous sounding gate swung to behind\nus--\"Well, I have found you again: a month's search has seemed long,\nand I little thought to have discovered my lost sheep straying amongst\ngraves.\"\n\nNever had I addressed her but as \"Mademoiselle\" before, and to speak\nthus was to take up a tone new to both her and me. Her answer suprised\nme that this language ruffled none of her feelings, woke no discord in\nher heart:\n\n\"Mon maitre,\" she said, \"have you troubled yourself to seek me? I little\nimagined you would think much of my absence, but I grieved bitterly to\nbe taken away from you. I was sorry for that circumstance when heavier\ntroubles ought to have made me forget it.\"\n\n\"Your aunt is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, a fortnight since, and she died full of regret, which I could not\nchase from her mind; she kept repeating, even during the last night\nof her existence, 'Frances, you will be so lonely when I am gone,\nso friendless:' she wished too that she could have been buried in\nSwitzerland, and it was I who persuaded her in her old age to leave the\nbanks of Lake Leman, and to come, only as it seems to die, in this flat\nregion of Flanders. Willingly would I have observed her last wish, and\ntaken her remains back to our own country, but that was impossible; I\nwas forced to lay her here.\"\n\n\"She was ill but a short time, I presume?\"\n\n\"But three weeks. When she began to sink I asked Mdlle. Reuter's leave\nto stay with her and wait on her; I readily got leave.\"\n\n\"Do you return to the pensionnat!\" I demanded hastily.\n\n\"Monsieur, when I had been at home a week Mdlle. Reuter called one\nevening, just after I had got my aunt to bed; she went into her room\nto speak to her, and was extremely civil and affable, as she always is;\nafterwards she came and sat with me a long time, and just as she rose to\ngo away, she said: \"Mademoiselle, I shall not soon cease to regret your\ndeparture from my establishment, though indeed it is true that you have\ntaught your class of pupils so well that they are all quite accomplished\nin the little works you manage so skilfully, and have not the slightest\nneed of further instruction; my second teacher must in future supply\nyour place, with regard to the younger pupils, as well as she can,\nthough she is indeed an inferior artiste to you, and doubtless it will\nbe your part now to assume a higher position in your calling; I am sure\nyou will everywhere find schools and families willing to profit by your\ntalents.' And then she paid me my last quarter's salary. I asked, as\nmademoiselle would no doubt think, very bluntly, if she designed to\ndischarge me from the establishment. She smiled at my inelegance of\nspeech, and answered that 'our connection as employer and employed was\ncertainly dissolved, but that she hoped still to retain the pleasure of\nmy acquaintance; she should always be happy to see me as a friend;' and\nthen she said something about the excellent condition of the streets,\nand the long continuance of fine weather, and went away quite cheerful.\"\n\nI laughed inwardly; all this was so like the directress--so like what I\nhad expected and guessed of her conduct; and then the exposure and proof\nof her lie, unconsciously afforded by Frances:--\"She had frequently\napplied for Mdlle. Henri's address,\" forsooth; \"Mdlle. Henri had always\nevaded giving it,\" &c., &c., and here I found her a visitor at the very\nhouse of whose locality she had professed absolute ignorance!\n\nAny comments I might have intended to make on my pupil's communication,\nwere checked by the plashing of large rain-drops on our faces and on the\npath, and by the muttering of a distant but coming storm. The warning\nobvious in stagnant air and leaden sky had already induced me to take\nthe road leading back to Brussels, and now I hastened my own steps and\nthose of my companion, and, as our way lay downhill, we got on rapidly.\nThere was an interval after the fall of the first broad drops before\nheavy rain came on; in the meantime we had passed through the Porte de\nLouvain, and were again in the city.\n\n\"Where do you live?\" I asked; \"I will see you safe home.\"\n\n\"Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges,\" answered Frances.\n\nIt was not far from the Rue de Louvain, and we stood on the doorsteps\nof the house we sought ere the clouds, severing with loud peal and\nshattered cataract of lightning, emptied their livid folds in a torrent,\nheavy, prone, and broad.\n\n\"Come in! come in!\" said Frances, as, after putting her into the house,\nI paused ere I followed: the word decided me; I stepped across the\nthreshold, shut the door on the rushing, flashing, whitening storm, and\nfollowed her upstairs to her apartments. Neither she nor I were wet; a\nprojection over the door had warded off the straight-descending flood;\nnone but the first, large drops had touched our garments; one minute\nmore and we should not have had a dry thread on us.\n\nStepping over a little mat of green wool, I found myself in a small room\nwith a painted floor and a square of green carpet in the middle; the\narticles of furniture were few, but all bright and exquisitely clean;\norder reigned through its narrow limits--such order as it soothed my\npunctilious soul to behold. And I had hesitated to enter the abode,\nbecause I apprehended after all that Mdlle. Reuter's hint about its\nextreme poverty might be too well-founded, and I feared to embarrass the\nlace-mender by entering her lodgings unawares! Poor the place might be;\npoor truly it was; but its neatness was better than elegance, and had\nbut a bright little fire shone on that clean hearth, I should have\ndeemed it more attractive than a palace. No fire was there, however, and\nno fuel laid ready to light; the lace-mender was unable to allow herself\nthat indulgence, especially now when, deprived by death of her sole\nrelative, she had only her own unaided exertions to rely on. Frances\nwent into an inner room to take off her bonnet, and she came out a\nmodel of frugal neatness, with her well-fitting black stuff dress, so\naccurately defining her elegant bust and taper waist, with her spotless\nwhite collar turned back from a fair and shapely neck, with her\nplenteous brown hair arranged in smooth bands on her temples, and in\na large Grecian plait behind: ornaments she had none--neither brooch,\nring, nor ribbon; she did well enough without them--perfection of fit,\nproportion of form, grace of carriage, agreeably supplied their place.\nHer eye, as she re-entered the small sitting-room, instantly sought\nmine, which was just then lingering on the hearth; I knew she read at\nonce the sort of inward ruth and pitying pain which the chill vacancy of\nthat hearth stirred in my soul: quick to penetrate, quick to determine,\nand quicker to put in practice, she had in a moment tied a holland apron\nround her waist; then she disappeared, and reappeared with a basket;\nit had a cover; she opened it, and produced wood and coal; deftly and\ncompactly she arranged them in the grate.\n\n\"It is her whole stock, and she will exhaust it out of hospitality,\"\nthought I.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked: \"not surely to light a fire this\nhot evening? I shall be smothered.\"\n\n\"Indeed, monsieur, I feel it very chilly since the rain began; besides,\nI must boil the water for my tea, for I take tea on Sundays; you will be\nobliged to try and bear the heat.\"\n\nShe had struck a light; the wood was already in a blaze; and truly, when\ncontrasted with the darkness, the wild tumult of the tempest without,\nthat peaceful glow which began to beam on the now animated hearth,\nseemed very cheering. A low, purring sound, from some quarter, announced\nthat another being, besides myself, was pleased with the change; a\nblack cat, roused by the light from its sleep on a little cushioned\nfoot-stool, came and rubbed its head against Frances' gown as she knelt;\nshe caressed it, saying it had been a favourite with her \"pauvre tante\nJulienne.\"\n\nThe fire being lit, the hearth swept, and a small kettle of a very\nantique pattern, such as I thought I remembered to have seen in old\nfarmhouses in England, placed over the now ruddy flame, Frances' hands\nwere washed, and her apron removed in an instant; then she opened a\ncupboard, and took out a tea-tray, on which she had soon arranged a\nchina tea-equipage, whose pattern, shape, and size, denoted a remote\nantiquity; a little, old-fashioned silver spoon was deposited in each\nsaucer; and a pair of silver tongs, equally old-fashioned, were laid\non the sugar-basin; from the cupboard, too, was produced a tidy\nsilver cream-ewer, not larger then an egg-shell. While making these\npreparations, she chanced to look up, and, reading curiosity in my eyes,\nshe smiled and asked--\n\n\"Is this like England, monsieur?\"\n\n\"Like the England of a hundred years ago,\" I replied.\n\n\"Is it truly? Well, everything on this tray is at least a hundred\nyears old: these cups, these spoons, this ewer, are all heirlooms; my\ngreat-grandmother left them to my grandmother, she to my mother, and my\nmother brought them with her from England to Switzerland, and left them\nto me; and, ever since I was a little girl, I have thought I should like\nto carry them back to England, whence they came.\"\n\nShe put some pistolets on the table; she made the tea, as foreigners do\nmake tea--i.e., at the rate of a teaspoonful to half-a-dozen cups;\nshe placed me a chair, and, as I took it, she asked, with a sort of\nexaltation--\n\n\"Will it make you think yourself at home for a moment?\"\n\n\"If I had a home in England, I believe it would recall it,\" I\nanswered; and, in truth, there was a sort of illusion in seeing the\nfair-complexioned English-looking girl presiding at the English meal,\nand speaking in the English language.\n\n\"You have then no home?\" was her remark.\n\n\"None, nor ever have had. If ever I possess a home, it must be of my own\nmaking, and the task is yet to begin.\" And, as I spoke, a pang, new to\nme, shot across my heart: it was a pang of mortification at the humility\nof my position, and the inadequacy of my means; while with that pang was\nborn a strong desire to do more, earn more, be more, possess more;\nand in the increased possessions, my roused and eager spirit panted to\ninclude the home I had never had, the wife I inwardly vowed to win.\n\nFrances' tea was little better than hot water, sugar, and milk; and her\npistolets, with which she could not offer me butter, were sweet to my\npalate as manna.\n\nThe repast over, and the treasured plate and porcelain being washed and\nput by, the bright table rubbed still brighter, \"le chat de ma tante\nJulienne\" also being fed with provisions brought forth on a plate for\nits special use, a few stray cinders, and a scattering of ashes too,\nbeing swept from the hearth, Frances at last sat down; and then, as she\ntook a chair opposite to me, she betrayed, for the first time, a little\nembarrassment; and no wonder, for indeed I had unconsciously watched\nher rather too closely, followed all her steps and all her movements\na little too perseveringly with my eyes, for she mesmerized me by\nthe grace and alertness of her action--by the deft, cleanly, and even\ndecorative effect resulting from each touch of her slight and fine\nfingers; and when, at last, she subsided to stillness, the intelligence\nof her face seemed beauty to me, and I dwelt on it accordingly. Her\ncolour, however, rising, rather than settling with repose, and her eyes\nremaining downcast, though I kept waiting for the lids to be raised that\nI might drink a ray of the light I loved--a light where fire dissolved\nin softness, where affection tempered penetration, where, just now\nat least, pleasure played with thought--this expectation not being\ngratified, I began at last to suspect that I had probably myself to\nblame for the disappointment; I must cease gazing, and begin talking,\nif I wished to break the spell under which she now sat motionless; so\nrecollecting the composing effect which an authoritative tone and manner\nhad ever been wont to produce on her, I said--\n\n\"Get one of your English books, mademoiselle, for the rain yet falls\nheavily, and will probably detain me half an hour longer.\"\n\nReleased, and set at ease, up she rose, got her book, and accepted at\nonce the chair I placed for her at my side. She had selected \"Paradise\nLost\" from her shelf of classics, thinking, I suppose, the religious\ncharacter of the book best adapted it to Sunday; I told her to begin at\nthe beginning, and while she read Milton's invocation to that heavenly\nmuse, who on the \"secret top of Oreb or Sinai\" had taught the Hebrew\nshepherd how in the womb of chaos, the conception of a world had\noriginated and ripened, I enjoyed, undisturbed, the treble pleasure of\nhaving her near me, hearing the sound of her voice--a sound sweet and\nsatisfying in my ear--and looking, by intervals, at her face: of this\nlast privilege, I chiefly availed myself when I found fault with an\nintonation, a pause, or an emphasis; as long as I dogmatized, I might\nalso gaze, without exciting too warm a flush.\n\n\"Enough,\" said I, when she had gone through some half dozen pages (a\nwork of time with her, for she read slowly and paused often to ask and\nreceive information)--\"enough; and now the rain is ceasing, and I must\nsoon go.\" For indeed, at that moment, looking towards the window, I\nsaw it all blue; the thunder-clouds were broken and scattered, and the\nsetting August sun sent a gleam like the reflection of rubies through\nthe lattice. I got up; I drew on my gloves.\n\n\"You have not yet found another situation to supply the place of that\nfrom which you were dismissed by Mdlle. Reuter?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur; I have made inquiries everywhere, but they all ask me\nfor references; and to speak truth, I do not like to apply to the\ndirectress, because I consider she acted neither justly nor honourably\ntowards me; she used underhand means to set my pupils against me, and\nthereby render me unhappy while I held my place in her establishment,\nand she eventually deprived me of it by a masked and hypocritical\nmanoeuvre, pretending that she was acting for my good, but really\nsnatching from me my chief means of subsistence, at a crisis when not\nonly my own life, but that of another, depended on my exertions: of her\nI will never more ask a favour.\"\n\n\"How, then, do you propose to get on? How do you live now?\"\n\n\"I have still my lace-mending trade; with care it will keep me from\nstarvation, and I doubt not by dint of exertion to get better employment\nyet; it is only a fortnight since I began to try; my courage or hopes\nare by no means worn out yet.\"\n\n\"And if you get what you wish, what then? what are your ultimate views?\"\n\n\"To save enough to cross the Channel: I always look to England as my\nCanaan.\"\n\n\"Well, well--ere long I shall pay you another visit; good evening now,\"\nand I left her rather abruptly; I had much ado to resist a strong inward\nimpulse, urging me to take a warmer, more expressive leave: what so\nnatural as to fold her for a moment in a close embrace, to imprint one\nkiss on her cheek or forehead? I was not unreasonable--that was all I\nwanted; satisfied in that point, I could go away content; and Reason\ndenied me even this; she ordered me to turn my eyes from her face, and\nmy steps from her apartment--to quit her as dryly and coldly as I would\nhave quitted old Madame Pelet. I obeyed, but I swore rancorously to be\navenged one day. \"I'll earn a right to do as I please in this matter,\nor I'll die in the contest. I have one object before me now--to get that\nGenevese girl for my wife; and my wife she shall be--that is, provided\nshe has as much, or half as much regard for her master as he has\nfor her. And would she be so docile, so smiling, so happy under my\ninstructions if she had not? would she sit at my side when I dictate\nor correct, with such a still, contented, halcyon mien?\" for I had ever\nremarked, that however sad or harassed her countenance might be when\nI entered a room, yet after I had been near her, spoken to her a few\nwords, given her some directions, uttered perhaps some reproofs, she\nwould, all at once, nestle into a nook of happiness, and look up serene\nand revived. The reproofs suited her best of all: while I scolded she\nwould chip away with her pen-knife at a pencil or a pen; fidgetting a\nlittle, pouting a little, defending herself by monosyllables, and when I\ndeprived her of the pen or pencil, fearing it would be all cut away,\nand when I interdicted even the monosyllabic defence, for the purpose\nof working up the subdued excitement a little higher, she would at last\nraise her eyes and give me a certain glance, sweetened with gaiety, and\npointed with defiance, which, to speak truth, thrilled me as nothing had\never done, and made me, in a fashion (though happily she did not know\nit), her subject, if not her slave. After such little scenes her spirits\nwould maintain their flow, often for some hours, and, as I remarked\nbefore, her health therefrom took a sustenance and vigour which,\npreviously to the event of her aunt's death and her dismissal, had\nalmost recreated her whole frame.\n\nIt has taken me several minutes to write these last sentences; but I had\nthought all their purport during the brief interval of descending the\nstairs from Frances' room. Just as I was opening the outer door,\nI remembered the twenty francs which I had not restored; I paused:\nimpossible to carry them away with me; difficult to force them back\non their original owner; I had now seen her in her own humble abode,\nwitnessed the dignity of her poverty, the pride of order, the fastidious\ncare of conservatism, obvious in the arrangement and economy of her\nlittle home; I was sure she would not suffer herself to be excused\npaying her debts; I was certain the favour of indemnity would be\naccepted from no hand, perhaps least of all from mine: yet these four\nfive-franc pieces were a burden to my self-respect, and I must get\nrid of them. An expedient--a clumsy one no doubt, but the best I\ncould devise-suggested itself to me. I darted up the stairs, knocked,\nre-entered the room as if in haste:--\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I have forgotten one of my gloves; I must have left it\nhere.\"\n\nShe instantly rose to seek it; as she turned her back, I--being now\nat the hearth--noiselessly lifted a little vase, one of a set of china\nornaments, as old-fashioned as the tea-cups--slipped the money under it,\nthen saying--\"Oh here is my glove! I had dropped it within the fender;\ngood evening, mademoiselle,\" I made my second exit.\n\nBrief as my impromptu return had been, it had afforded me time to pick\nup a heart-ache; I remarked that Frances had already removed the red\nembers of her cheerful little fire from the grate: forced to calculate\nevery item, to save in every detail, she had instantly on my departure\nretrenched a luxury too expensive to be enjoyed alone.\n\n\"I am glad it is not yet winter,\" thought I; \"but in two months more\ncome the winds and rains of November; would to God that before then I\ncould earn the right, and the power, to shovel coals into that grate AD\nLIBITUM!\"\n\nAlready the pavement was drying; a balmy and fresh breeze stirred the\nair, purified by lightning; I felt the West behind me, where spread a\nsky like opal; azure immingled with crimson: the enlarged sun, glorious\nin Tyrian tints, dipped his brim already; stepping, as I was, eastward,\nI faced a vast bank of clouds, but also I had before me the arch of an\nevening rainbow; a perfect rainbow--high, wide, vivid. I looked long;\nmy eye drank in the scene, and I suppose my brain must have absorbed\nit; for that night, after lying awake in pleasant fever a long time,\nwatching the silent sheet-lightning, which still played among the\nretreating clouds, and flashed silvery over the stars, I at last fell\nasleep; and then in a dream were reproduced the setting sun, the bank of\nclouds, the mighty rainbow. I stood, methought, on a terrace; I leaned\nover a parapeted wall; there was space below me, depth I could not\nfathom, but hearing an endless dash of waves, I believed it to be the\nsea; sea spread to the horizon; sea of changeful green and intense\nblue: all was soft in the distance; all vapour-veiled. A spark of gold\nglistened on the line between water and air, floated up, approached,\nenlarged, changed; the object hung midway between heaven and earth,\nunder the arch of the rainbow; the soft but dusk clouds diffused behind.\nIt hovered as on wings; pearly, fleecy, gleaming air streamed like\nraiment round it; light, tinted with carnation, coloured what seemed\nface and limbs; a large star shone with still lustre on an angel's\nforehead; an upraised arm and hand, glancing like a ray, pointed to the\nbow overhead, and a voice in my heart whispered--\n\n\"Hope smiles on Effort!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nA COMPETENCY was what I wanted; a competency it was now my aim and\nresolve to secure; but never had I been farther from the mark. With\nAugust the school-year (l'annee scolaire) closed, the examinations\nconcluded, the prizes were adjudged, the schools dispersed, the gates of\nall colleges, the doors of all pensionnats shut, not to be reopened till\nthe beginning or middle of October. The last day of August was at hand,\nand what was my position? Had I advanced a step since the commencement\nof the past quarter? On the contrary, I had receded one. By renouncing\nmy engagement as English master in Mdlle. Reuter's establishment, I had\nvoluntarily cut off 20l. from my yearly income; I had diminished my 60l.\nper annum to 40l., and even that sum I now held by a very precarious\ntenure.\n\nIt is some time since I made any reference to M. Pelet. The moonlight\nwalk is, I think, the last incident recorded in this narrative where\nthat gentleman cuts any conspicuous figure: the fact is, since that\nevent, a change had come over the spirit of our intercourse. He, indeed,\nignorant that the still hour, a cloudless moon, and an open lattice,\nhad revealed to me the secret of his selfish love and false friendship,\nwould have continued smooth and complaisant as ever; but I grew spiny as\na porcupine, and inflexible as a blackthorn cudgel; I never had a smile\nfor his raillery, never a moment for his society; his invitations to\ntake coffee with him in his parlour were invariably rejected, and\nvery stiffly and sternly rejected too; his jesting allusions to the\ndirectress (which he still continued) were heard with a grim calm very\ndifferent from the petulant pleasure they were formerly wont to excite.\nFor a long time Pelet bore with my frigid demeanour very patiently;\nhe even increased his attentions; but finding that even a cringing\npoliteness failed to thaw or move me, he at last altered too; in\nhis turn he cooled; his invitations ceased; his countenance became\nsuspicious and overcast, and I read in the perplexed yet brooding aspect\nof his brow, a constant examination and comparison of premises, and an\nanxious endeavour to draw thence some explanatory inference. Ere long,\nI fancy, he succeeded, for he was not without penetration; perhaps, too,\nMdlle. Zoraide might have aided him in the solution of the enigma; at\nany rate I soon found that the uncertainty of doubt had vanished from\nhis manner; renouncing all pretence of friendship and cordiality, he\nadopted a reserved, formal, but still scrupulously polite deportment.\nThis was the point to which I had wished to bring him, and I was now\nagain comparatively at my ease. I did not, it is true, like my position\nin his house; but being freed from the annoyance of false professions\nand double-dealing I could endure it, especially as no heroic sentiment\nof hatred or jealousy of the director distracted my philosophical soul;\nhe had not, I found, wounded me in a very tender point, the wound was so\nsoon and so radically healed, leaving only a sense of contempt for\nthe treacherous fashion in which it had been inflicted, and a lasting\nmistrust of the hand which I had detected attempting to stab in the\ndark.\n\nThis state of things continued till about the middle of July, and then\nthere was a little change; Pelet came home one night, an hour after his\nusual time, in a state of unequivocal intoxication, a thing anomalous\nwith him; for if he had some of the worst faults of his countrymen,\nhe had also one at least of their virtues, i.e. sobriety. So drunk,\nhowever, was he upon this occasion, that after having roused the whole\nestablishment (except the pupils, whose dormitory being over the classes\nin a building apart from the dwelling-house, was consequently out of the\nreach of disturbance) by violently ringing the hall-bell and ordering\nlunch to be brought in immediately, for he imagined it was noon, whereas\nthe city bells had just tolled midnight; after having furiously rated\nthe servants for their want of punctuality, and gone near to chastise\nhis poor old mother, who advised him to go to bed, he began raving\ndreadfully about \"le maudit Anglais, Creemsvort.\" I had not yet retired;\nsome German books I had got hold of had kept me up late; I heard the\nuproar below, and could distinguish the director's voice exalted in\na manner as appalling as it was unusual. Opening my door a little, I\nbecame aware of a demand on his part for \"Creemsvort\" to be brought\ndown to him that he might cut his throat on the hall-table and wash\nhis honour, which he affirmed to be in a dirty condition, in infernal\nBritish blood. \"He is either mad or drunk,\" thought I, \"and in either\ncase the old woman and the servants will be the better of a man's\nassistance,\" so I descended straight to the hall. I found him staggering\nabout, his eyes in a fine frenzy rolling--a pretty sight he was, a just\nmedium between the fool and the lunatic.\n\n\"Come, M. Pelet,\" said I, \"you had better go to bed,\" and I took hold of\nhis arm. His excitement, of course, increased greatly at sight and touch\nof the individual for whose blood he had been making application: he\nstruggled and struck with fury--but a drunken man is no match for a\nsober one; and, even in his normal state, Pelet's worn out frame could\nnot have stood against my sound one. I got him up-stairs, and, in\nprocess of time, to bed. During the operation he did not fail to\nutter comminations which, though broken, had a sense in them; while\nstigmatizing me as the treacherous spawn of a perfidious country, he,\nin the same breath, anathematized Zoraide Reuter; he termed her \"femme\nsotte et vicieuse,\" who, in a fit of lewd caprice, had thrown herself\naway on an unprincipled adventurer; directing the point of the last\nappellation by a furious blow, obliquely aimed at me. I left him in the\nact of bounding elastically out of the bed into which I had tucked him;\nbut, as I took the precaution of turning the key in the door behind me,\nI retired to my own room, assured of his safe custody till the morning,\nand free to draw undisturbed conclusions from the scene I had just\nwitnessed.\n\nNow, it was precisely about this time that the directress, stung by\nmy coldness, bewitched by my scorn, and excited by the preference she\nsuspected me of cherishing for another, had fallen into a snare of her\nown laying--was herself caught in the meshes of the very passion with\nwhich she wished to entangle me. Conscious of the state of things in\nthat quarter, I gathered, from the condition in which I saw my\nemployer, that his lady-love had betrayed the alienation of her\naffections--inclinations, rather, I would say; affection is a word at\nonce too warm and too pure for the subject--had let him see that the\ncavity of her hollow heart, emptied of his image, was now occupied by\nthat of his usher. It was not without some surprise that I found\nmyself obliged to entertain this view of the case; Pelet, with\nhis old-established school, was so convenient, so profitable a\nmatch--Zoraide was so calculating, so interested a woman--I wondered\nmere personal preference could, in her mind, have prevailed for a moment\nover worldly advantage: yet, it was evident, from what Pelet said, that,\nnot only had she repulsed him, but had even let slip expressions of\npartiality for me. One of his drunken exclamations was, \"And the\njade doats on your youth, you raw blockhead! and talks of your noble\ndeportment, as she calls your accursed English formality--and your pure\nmorals, forsooth! des moeurs de Caton a-t-elle dit--sotte!\" Hers, I\nthought, must be a curious soul, where in spite of a strong, natural\ntendency to estimate unduly advantages of wealth and station, the\nsardonic disdain of a fortuneless subordinate had wrought a deeper\nimpression than could be imprinted by the most flattering assiduities of\na prosperous CHEF D'INSTITUTION. I smiled inwardly; and strange to say,\nthough my AMOUR PROPRE was excited not disagreeably by the conquest, my\nbetter feelings remained untouched. Next day, when I saw the directress,\nand when she made an excuse to meet me in the corridor, and besought my\nnotice by a demeanour and look subdued to Helot humility, I could\nnot love, I could scarcely pity her. To answer briefly and dryly\nsome interesting inquiry about my health--to pass her by with a stern\nbow--was all I could; her presence and manner had then, and for some\ntime previously and consequently, a singular effect upon me: they\nsealed up all that was good elicited all that was noxious in my nature;\nsometimes they enervated my senses, but they always hardened my heart.\nI was aware of the detriment done, and quarrelled with myself for the\nchange. I had ever hated a tyrant; and, behold, the possession of a\nslave, self-given, went near to transform me into what I abhorred!\nThere was at once a sort of low gratification in receiving this luscious\nincense from an attractive and still young worshipper; and an irritating\nsense of degradation in the very experience of the pleasure. When she\nstole about me with the soft step of a slave, I felt at once barbarous\nand sensual as a pasha. I endured her homage sometimes; sometimes I\nrebuked it. My indifference or harshness served equally to increase the\nevil I desired to check.\n\n\"Que le dedain lui sied bien!\" I once overheard her say to her mother:\n\"il est beau comme Apollon quand il sourit de son air hautain.\"\n\nAnd the jolly old dame laughed, and said she thought her daughter was\nbewitched, for I had no point of a handsome man about me, except being\nstraight and without deformity. \"Pour moi,\" she continued, \"il me fait\ntout l'effet d'un chat-huant, avec ses besicles.\"\n\nWorthy old girl! I could have gone and kissed her had she not been a\nlittle too old, too fat, and too red-faced; her sensible, truthful\nwords seemed so wholesome, contrasted with the morbid illusions of her\ndaughter.\n\nWhen Pelet awoke on the morning after his frenzy fit, he retained no\nrecollection of what had happened the previous night, and his mother\nfortunately had the discretion to refrain from informing him that I had\nbeen a witness of his degradation. He did not again have recourse to\nwine for curing his griefs, but even in his sober mood he soon showed\nthat the iron of jealousy had entered into his soul. A thorough\nFrenchman, the national characteristic of ferocity had not been omitted\nby nature in compounding the ingredients of his character; it had\nappeared first in his access of drunken wrath, when some of his\ndemonstrations of hatred to my person were of a truly fiendish\ncharacter, and now it was more covertly betrayed by momentary\ncontractions of the features, and flashes of fierceness in his light\nblue eyes, when their glance chanced to encounter mine. He absolutely\navoided speaking to me; I was now spared even the falsehood of his\npoliteness. In this state of our mutual relations, my soul rebelled\nsometimes almost ungovernably, against living in the house and\ndischarging the service of such a man; but who is free from the\nconstraint of circumstances? At that time, I was not: I used to rise\neach morning eager to shake off his yoke, and go out with my portmanteau\nunder my arm, if a beggar, at least a freeman; and in the evening, when\nI came back from the pensionnat de demoiselles, a certain pleasant voice\nin my ear; a certain face, so intelligent, yet so docile, so reflective,\nyet so soft, in my eyes; a certain cast of character, at once proud\nand pliant, sensitive and sagacious, serious and ardent, in my head; a\ncertain tone of feeling, fervid and modest, refined and practical, pure\nand powerful, delighting and troubling my memory--visions of new ties I\nlonged to contract, of new duties I longed to undertake, had taken the\nrover and the rebel out of me, and had shown endurance of my hated lot\nin the light of a Spartan virtue.\n\nBut Pelet's fury subsided; a fortnight sufficed for its rise, progress,\nand extinction: in that space of time the dismissal of the obnoxious\nteacher had been effected in the neighbouring house, and in the same\ninterval I had declared my resolution to follow and find out my pupil,\nand upon my application for her address being refused, I had summarily\nresigned my own post. This last act seemed at once to restore Mdlle.\nReuter to her senses; her sagacity, her judgment, so long misled by a\nfascinating delusion, struck again into the right track the moment\nthat delusion vanished. By the right track, I do not mean the steep and\ndifficult path of principle--in that path she never trod; but the plain\nhighway of common sense, from which she had of late widely diverged.\nWhen there she carefully sought, and having found, industriously pursued\nthe trail of her old suitor, M. Pelet. She soon overtook him. What arts\nshe employed to soothe and blind him I know not, but she succeeded both\nin allaying his wrath, and hoodwinking his discernment, as was soon\nproved by the alteration in his mien and manner; she must have managed\nto convince him that I neither was, nor ever had been, a rival of his,\nfor the fortnight of fury against me terminated in a fit of exceeding\ngraciousness and amenity, not unmixed with a dash of exulting\nself-complacency, more ludicrous than irritating. Pelet's bachelor's\nlife had been passed in proper French style with due disregard to moral\nrestraint, and I thought his married life promised to be very French\nalso. He often boasted to me what a terror he had been to certain\nhusbands of his acquaintance; I perceived it would not now be difficult\nto pay him back in his own coin.\n\nThe crisis drew on. No sooner had the holidays commenced than note of\npreparation for some momentous event sounded all through the premises\nof Pelet: painters, polishers, and upholsterers were immediately set\nto work, and there was talk of \"la chambre de Madame,\" \"le salon de\nMadame.\" Not deeming it probable that the old duenna at present graced\nwith that title in our house, had inspired her son with such enthusiasm\nof filial piety, as to induce him to fit up apartments expressly for her\nuse, I concluded, in common with the cook, the two housemaids, and the\nkitchen-scullion, that a new and more juvenile Madame was destined to be\nthe tenant of these gay chambers.\n\nPresently official announcement of the coming event was put forth. In\nanother week's time M. Francois Pelet, directeur, and Mdlle. Zoraide\nReuter, directrice, were to be joined together in the bands of\nmatrimony. Monsieur, in person, heralded the fact to me; terminating\nhis communication by an obliging expression of his desire that I should\ncontinue, as heretofore, his ablest assistant and most trusted friend;\nand a proposition to raise my salary by an additional two hundred francs\nper annum. I thanked him, gave no conclusive answer at the time, and,\nwhen he had left me, threw off my blouse, put on my coat, and set out\non a long walk outside the Porte de Flandre, in order, as I thought, to\ncool my blood, calm my nerves, and shake my disarranged ideas into some\norder. In fact, I had just received what was virtually my dismissal.\nI could not conceal, I did not desire to conceal from myself the\nconviction that, being now certain that Mdlle. Reuter was destined to\nbecome Madame Pelet it would not do for me to remain a dependent dweller\nin the house which was soon to be hers. Her present demeanour towards\nme was deficient neither in dignity nor propriety; but I knew her former\nfeeling was unchanged. Decorum now repressed, and Policy masked it, but\nOpportunity would be too strong for either of these--Temptation would\nshiver their restraints.\n\nI was no pope--I could not boast infallibility: in short, if I stayed,\nthe probability was that, in three months' time, a practical modern\nFrench novel would be in full process of concoction under the roof of\nthe unsuspecting Pelet. Now, modern French novels are not to my\ntaste, either practically or theoretically. Limited as had yet been my\nexperience of life, I had once had the opportunity of contemplating,\nnear at hand, an example of the results produced by a course of\ninteresting and romantic domestic treachery. No golden halo of fiction\nwas about this example, I saw it bare and real, and it was very\nloathsome. I saw a mind degraded by the practice of mean subterfuge, by\nthe habit of perfidious deception, and a body depraved by the infectious\ninfluence of the vice-polluted soul. I had suffered much from the forced\nand prolonged view of this spectacle; those sufferings I did not now\nregret, for their simple recollection acted as a most wholesome antidote\nto temptation. They had inscribed on my reason the conviction that\nunlawful pleasure, trenching on another's rights, is delusive and\nenvenomed pleasure--its hollowness disappoints at the time, its poison\ncruelly tortures afterwards, its effects deprave for ever.\n\nFrom all this resulted the conclusion that I must leave Pelet's, and\nthat instantly; \"but,\" said Prudence, \"you know not where to go, nor how\nto live;\" and then the dream of true love came over me: Frances Henri\nseemed to stand at my side; her slender waist to invite my arm; her\nhand to court my hand; I felt it was made to nestle in mine; I could not\nrelinquish my right to it, nor could I withdraw my eyes for ever from\nhers, where I saw so much happiness, such a correspondence of heart with\nheart; over whose expression I had such influence; where I could kindle\nbliss, infuse awe, stir deep delight, rouse sparkling spirit, and\nsometimes waken pleasurable dread. My hopes to will and possess, my\nresolutions to merit and rise, rose in array against me; and here I was\nabout to plunge into the gulf of absolute destitution; \"and all this,\"\nsuggested an inward voice, \"because you fear an evil which may never\nhappen!\" \"It will happen; you KNOW it will,\" answered that stubborn\nmonitor, Conscience. \"Do what you feel is right; obey me, and even in\nthe sloughs of want I will plant for you firm footing.\" And then, as I\nwalked fast along the road, there rose upon me a strange, inly-felt idea\nof some Great Being, unseen, but all present, who in His beneficence\ndesired only my welfare, and now watched the struggle of good and evil\nin my heart, and waited to see whether I should obey His voice, heard in\nthe whispers of my conscience, or lend an ear to the sophisms by which\nHis enemy and mine--the Spirit of Evil--sought to lead me astray.\nRough and steep was the path indicated by divine suggestion; mossy and\ndeclining the green way along which Temptation strewed flowers; but\nwhereas, methought, the Deity of Love, the Friend of all that exists,\nwould smile well-pleased were I to gird up my loins and address myself\nto the rude ascent; so, on the other hand, each inclination to the\nvelvet declivity seemed to kindle a gleam of triumph on the brow of the\nman-hating, God-defying demon. Sharp and short I turned round; fast I\nretraced my steps; in half an hour I was again at M. Pelet's: I sought\nhim in his study; brief parley, concise explanation sufficed; my manner\nproved that I was resolved; he, perhaps, at heart approved my\ndecision. After twenty minutes' conversation, I re-entered my own room,\nself-deprived of the means of living, self-sentenced to leave my present\nhome, with the short notice of a week in which to provide another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nDIRECTLY as I closed the door, I saw laid on the table two letters; my\nthought was, that they were notes of invitation from the friends of some\nof my pupils; I had received such marks of attention occasionally, and\nwith me, who had no friends, correspondence of more interest was out\nof the question; the postman's arrival had never yet been an event of\ninterest to me since I came to Brussels. I laid my hand carelessly on\nthe documents, and coldly and slowly glancing at them, I prepared to\nbreak the seals; my eye was arrested and my hand too; I saw what excited\nme, as if I had found a vivid picture where I expected only to discover\na blank page: on one cover was an English postmark; on the other, a\nlady's clear, fine autograph; the last I opened first:--\n\n\"MONSIEUR,\n\n\"I FOUND out what you had done the very morning after your visit to me;\nyou might be sure I should dust the china, every day; and, as no one but\nyou had been in my room for a week, and as fairy-money is not current\nin Brussels, I could not doubt who left the twenty francs on the\nchimney-piece. I thought I heard you stir the vase when I was stooping\nto look for your glove under the table, and I wondered you should\nimagine it had got into such a little cup. Now, monsieur, the money\nis not mine, and I shall not keep it; I will not send it in this note\nbecause it might be lost--besides, it is heavy; but I will restore it\nto you the first time I see you, and you must make no difficulties about\ntaking it; because, in the first place, I am sure, monsieur, you can\nunderstand that one likes to pay one's debts; that it is satisfactory\nto owe no man anything; and, in the second place, I can now very well\nafford to be honest, as I am provided with a situation. This last\ncircumstance is, indeed, the reason of my writing to you, for it is\npleasant to communicate good news; and, in these days, I have only my\nmaster to whom I can tell anything.\n\n\"A week ago, monsieur, I was sent for by a Mrs. Wharton, an English\nlady; her eldest daughter was going to be married, and some rich\nrelation having made her a present of a veil and dress in costly old\nlace, as precious, they said, almost as jewels, but a little damaged by\ntime, I was commissioned to put them in repair. I had to do it at the\nhouse; they gave me, besides, some embroidery to complete, and nearly\na week elapsed before I had finished everything. While I worked, Miss\nWharton often came into the room and sat with me, and so did Mrs.\nWharton; they made me talk English; asked how I had learned to speak it\nso well; then they inquired what I knew besides--what books I had read;\nsoon they seemed to make a sort of wonder of me, considering me no doubt\nas a learned grisette. One afternoon, Mrs. Wharton brought in a Parisian\nlady to test the accuracy of my knowledge of French; the result of\nit was that, owing probably in a great degree to the mother's and\ndaughter's good humour about the marriage, which inclined them to\ndo beneficent deeds, and partly, I think, because they are naturally\nbenevolent people, they decided that the wish I had expressed to do\nsomething more than mend lace was a very legitimate one; and the same\nday they took me in their carriage to Mrs. D.'s, who is the directress\nof the first English school at Brussels. It seems she happened to be in\nwant of a French lady to give lessons in geography, history, grammar,\nand composition, in the French language. Mrs. Wharton recommended me\nvery warmly; and, as two of her younger daughters are pupils in the\nhouse, her patronage availed to get me the place. It was settled that I\nam to attend six hours daily (for, happily, it was not required that\nI should live in the house; I should have been sorry to leave my\nlodgings), and, for this, Mrs. D. will give me twelve hundred francs per\nannum.\n\n\"You see, therefore, monsieur, that I am now rich; richer almost than\nI ever hoped to be: I feel thankful for it, especially as my sight was\nbeginning to be injured by constant working at fine lace; and I was\ngetting, too, very weary of sitting up late at nights, and yet not being\nable to find time for reading or study. I began to fear that I should\nfall ill, and be unable to pay my way; this fear is now, in a great\nmeasure, removed; and, in truth, monsieur, I am very grateful to God for\nthe relief; and I feel it necessary, almost, to speak of my happiness\nto some one who is kind-hearted enough to derive joy from seeing others\njoyful. I could not, therefore, resist the temptation of writing to you;\nI argued with myself it is very pleasant for me to write, and it will\nnot be exactly painful, though it may be tiresome to monsieur to\nread. Do not be too angry with my circumlocution and inelegancies of\nexpression, and, believe me\n\n\"Your attached pupil,\n\n\"F. E. HENRI.\"\n\nHaving read this letter, I mused on its contents for a few\nmoments--whether with sentiments pleasurable or otherwise I will\nhereafter note--and then took up the other. It was directed in a hand\nto me unknown--small, and rather neat; neither masculine nor exactly\nfeminine; the seal bore a coat of arms, concerning which I could only\ndecipher that it was not that of the Seacombe family, consequently the\nepistle could be from none of my almost forgotten, and certainly quite\nforgetting patrician relations. From whom, then, was it? I removed the\nenvelope; the note folded within ran as follows:\n\n\"I have no doubt in the world that you are doing well in that greasy\nFlanders; living probably on the fat of the unctuous land; sitting like\na black-haired, tawny-skinned, long-nosed Israelite by the flesh-pots\nof Egypt; or like a rascally son of Levi near the brass cauldrons of the\nsanctuary, and every now and then plunging in a consecrated hook, and\ndrawing out of the sea of broth the fattest of heave-shoulders and the\nfleshiest of wave-breasts. I know this, because you never write to any\none in England. Thankless dog that you are! I, by the sovereign efficacy\nof my recommendation, got you the place where you are now living in\nclover, and yet not a word of gratitude, or even acknowledgment, have\nyou ever offered in return; but I am coming to see you, and small\nconception can you, with your addled aristocratic brains, form of the\nsort of moral kicking I have, ready packed in my carpet-bag, destined to\nbe presented to you immediately on my arrival.\n\n\"Meantime I know all about your affairs, and have just got information,\nby Brown's last letter, that you are said to be on the point of forming\nan advantageous match with a pursy, little Belgian schoolmistress--a\nMdlle. Zenobie, or some such name. Won't I have a look at her when I\ncome over! And this you may rely on: if she pleases my taste, or if I\nthink it worth while in a pecuniary point of view, I'll pounce on your\nprize and bear her away triumphant in spite of your teeth. Yet I don't\nlike dumpies either, and Brown says she is little and stout--the better\nfitted for a wiry, starved-looking chap like you. \"Be on the look-out,\nfor you know neither the day nor hour when your ----\" (I don't wish to\nblaspheme, so I'll leave a blank)--cometh.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"HUNSDEN YORKE HUNSDEN.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said I; and ere I laid the letter down, I again glanced at the\nsmall, neat handwriting, not a bit like that of a mercantile man, nor,\nindeed, of any man except Hunsden himself. They talk of affinities\nbetween the autograph and the character: what affinity was there here?\nI recalled the writer's peculiar face and certain traits I suspected,\nrather than knew, to appertain to his nature, and I answered, \"A great\ndeal.\"\n\nHunsden, then, was coming to Brussels, and coming I knew not when;\ncoming charged with the expectation of finding me on the summit of\nprosperity, about to be married, to step into a warm nest, to lie\ncomfortably down by the side of a snug, well-fed little mate.\n\n\"I wish him joy of the fidelity of the picture he has painted,\" thought\nI. \"What will he say when, instead of a pair of plump turtle doves,\nbilling and cooing in a bower of roses, he finds a single lean\ncormorant, standing mateless and shelterless on poverty's bleak cliff?\nOh, confound him! Let him come, and let him laugh at the contrast\nbetween rumour and fact. Were he the devil himself, instead of being\nmerely very like him, I'd not condescend to get out of his way, or to\nforge a smile or a cheerful word wherewith to avert his sarcasm.\"\n\nThen I recurred to the other letter: that struck a chord whose sound I\ncould not deaden by thrusting my fingers into my ears, for it vibrated\nwithin; and though its swell might be exquisite music, its cadence was a\ngroan.\n\nThat Frances was relieved from the pressure of want, that the curse of\nexcessive labour was taken off her, filled me with happiness; that her\nfirst thought in prosperity should be to augment her joy by sharing\nit with me, met and satisfied the wish of my heart. Two results of her\nletter were then pleasant, sweet as two draughts of nectar; but applying\nmy lips for the third time to the cup, and they were excoriated as with\nvinegar and gall.\n\nTwo persons whose desires are moderate may live well enough in Brussels\non an income which would scarcely afford a respectable maintenance for\none in London: and that, not because the necessaries of life are so\nmuch dearer in the latter capital, or taxes so much higher than in the\nformer, but because the English surpass in folly all the nations on\nGod's earth, and are more abject slaves to custom, to opinion, to\nthe desire to keep up a certain appearance, than the Italians are to\npriestcraft, the French to vain-glory, the Russians to their Czar, or\nthe Germans to black beer. I have seen a degree of sense in the modest\narrangement of one homely Belgian household, that might put to shame the\nelegance, the superfluities, the luxuries, the strained refinements of\na hundred genteel English mansions. In Belgium, provided you can\nmake money, you may save it; this is scarcely possible in England;\nostentation there lavishes in a month what industry has earned in a\nyear. More shame to all classes in that most bountiful and beggarly\ncountry for their servile following of Fashion; I could write a chapter\nor two on this subject, but must forbear, at least for the present. Had\nI retained my 60l. per annum I could, now that Frances was in possession\nof 50l., have gone straight to her this very evening, and spoken out the\nwords which, repressed, kept fretting my heart with fever; our united\nincome would, as we should have managed it, have sufficed well for\nour mutual support; since we lived in a country where economy was not\nconfounded with meanness, where frugality in dress, food, and furniture,\nwas not synonymous with vulgarity in these various points. But the\nplaceless usher, bare of resource, and unsupported by connections, must\nnot think of this; such a sentiment as love, such a word as marriage,\nwere misplaced in his heart, and on his lips. Now for the first time did\nI truly feel what it was to be poor; now did the sacrifice I had made\nin casting from me the means of living put on a new aspect; instead of\na correct, just, honourable act, it seemed a deed at once light and\nfanatical; I took several turns in my room, under the goading influence\nof most poignant remorse; I walked a quarter of an hour from the wall to\nthe window; and at the window, self-reproach seemed to face me; at the\nwall, self-disdain: all at once out spoke Conscience:--\n\n\"Down, stupid tormenters!\" cried she; \"the man has done his duty;\nyou shall not bait him thus by thoughts of what might have been; he\nrelinquished a temporary and contingent good to avoid a permanent and\ncertain evil he did well. Let him reflect now, and when your blinding\ndust and deafening hum subside, he will discover a path.\"\n\nI sat down; I propped my forehead on both my hands; I thought and\nthought an hour--two hours; vainly. I seemed like one sealed in a\nsubterranean vault, who gazes at utter blackness; at blackness ensured\nby yard-thick stone walls around, and by piles of building above,\nexpecting light to penetrate through granite, and through cement firm\nas granite. But there are chinks, or there may be chinks, in the\nbest adjusted masonry; there was a chink in my cavernous cell; for,\neventually, I saw, or seemed to see, a ray--pallid, indeed, and cold,\nand doubtful, but still a ray, for it showed that narrow path which\nconscience had promised after two, three hours' torturing research in\nbrain and memory, I disinterred certain remains of circumstances, and\nconceived a hope that by putting them together an expedient might be\nframed, and a resource discovered. The circumstances were briefly these:\n\nSome three months ago M. Pelet had, on the occasion of his fete, given\nthe boys a treat, which treat consisted in a party of pleasure to a\ncertain place of public resort in the outskirts of Brussels, of which\nI do not at this moment remember the name, but near it were several of\nthose lakelets called etangs; and there was one etang, larger than the\nrest, where on holidays people were accustomed to amuse themselves by\nrowing round it in little boats. The boys having eaten an unlimited\nquantity of \"gaufres,\" and drank several bottles of Louvain beer, amid\nthe shades of a garden made and provided for such crams, petitioned\nthe director for leave to take a row on the etang. Half a dozen of the\neldest succeeded in obtaining leave, and I was commissioned to accompany\nthem as surveillant. Among the half dozen happened to be a certain Jean\nBaptiste Vandenhuten, a most ponderous young Flamand, not tall, but\neven now, at the early age of sixteen, possessing a breadth and depth of\npersonal development truly national. It chanced that Jean was the first\nlad to step into the boat; he stumbled, rolled to one side, the boat\nrevolted at his weight and capsized. Vandenhuten sank like lead, rose,\nsank again. My coat and waistcoat were off in an instant; I had not been\nbrought up at Eton and boated and bathed and swam there ten long years\nfor nothing; it was a natural and easy act for me to leap to the rescue.\nThe lads and the boatmen yelled; they thought there would be two deaths\nby drowning instead of one; but as Jean rose the third time, I clutched\nhim by one leg and the collar, and in three minutes more both he and I\nwere safe landed. To speak heaven's truth, my merit in the action was\nsmall indeed, for I had run no risk, and subsequently did not even catch\ncold from the wetting; but when M. and Madame Vandenhuten, of whom Jean\nBaptiste was the sole hope, came to hear of the exploit, they seemed\nto think I had evinced a bravery and devotion which no thanks could\nsufficiently repay. Madame, in particular, was \"certain I must have\ndearly loved their sweet son, or I would not thus have hazarded my own\nlife to save his.\" Monsieur, an honest-looking, though phlegmatic man,\nsaid very little, but he would not suffer me to leave the room, till\nI had promised that in case I ever stood in need of help I would, by\napplying to him, give him a chance of discharging the obligation under\nwhich he affirmed I had laid him. These words, then, were my glimmer of\nlight; it was here I found my sole outlet; and in truth, though the cold\nlight roused, it did not cheer me; nor did the outlet seem such as I\nshould like to pass through. Right I had none to M. Vandenhuten's good\noffices; it was not on the ground of merit I could apply to him; no, I\nmust stand on that of necessity: I had no work; I wanted work; my best\nchance of obtaining it lay in securing his recommendation. This I knew\ncould be had by asking for it; not to ask, because the request revolted\nmy pride and contradicted my habits, would, I felt, be an indulgence of\nfalse and indolent fastidiousness. I might repent the omission all my\nlife; I would not then be guilty of it.\n\nThat evening I went to M. Vandenhuten's; but I had bent the bow and\nadjusted the shaft in vain; the string broke. I rang the bell at the\ngreat door (it was a large, handsome house in an expensive part of the\ntown); a manservant opened; I asked for M. Vandenhuten; M. Vandenhuten\nand family were all out of town--gone to Ostend--did not know when they\nwould be back. I left my card, and retraced my steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA WEEK is gone; LE JOUR DES NOCES arrived; the marriage was solemnized\nat St. Jacques; Mdlle. Zoraide became Madame Pelet, NEE Reuter; and, in\nabout an hour after this transformation, \"the happy pair,\" as newspapers\nphrase it, were on their way to Paris; where, according to previous\narrangement, the honeymoon was to be spent. The next day I quitted the\npensionnat. Myself and my chattels (some books and clothes) were soon\ntransferred to a modest lodging I had hired in a street not far off. In\nhalf an hour my clothes were arranged in a commode, my books on a shelf,\nand the \"flitting\" was effected. I should not have been unhappy that day\nhad not one pang tortured me--a longing to go to the Rue Notre Dame\naux Neiges, resisted, yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid\nthat street till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my\nprospects.\n\nIt was a sweet September evening--very mild, very still; I had nothing\nto do; at that hour I knew Frances would be equally released from\noccupation; I thought she might possibly be wishing for her master, I\nknew I wished for my pupil. Imagination began with her low whispers,\ninfusing into my soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be.\n\n\"You will find her reading or writing,\" said she; \"you can take your\nseat at her side; you need not startle her peace by undue excitement;\nyou need not embarrass her manner by unusual action or language. Be as\nyou always are; look over what she has written; listen while she reads;\nchide her, or quietly approve; you know the effect of either system; you\nknow her smile when pleased, you know the play of her looks when roused;\nyou have the secret of awakening what expression you will, and you can\nchoose amongst that pleasant variety. With you she will sit silent as\nlong as it suits you to talk alone; you can hold her under a potent\nspell: intelligent as she is, eloquent as she can be, you can seal her\nlips, and veil her bright countenance with diffidence; yet, you know,\nshe is not all monotonous mildness; you have seen, with a sort of\nstrange pleasure, revolt, scorn, austerity, bitterness, lay energetic\nclaim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy; you know that few\ncould rule her as you do; you know she might break, but never bend under\nthe hand of Tyranny and Injustice, but Reason and Affection can guide\nher by a sign. Try their influence now. Go--they are not passions; you\nmay handle them safely.\"\n\n\"I will NOT go was my answer to the sweet temptress. A man is master\nof himself to a certain point, but not beyond it. Could I seek Frances\nto-night, could I sit with her alone in a quiet room, and address her\nonly in the language of Reason and Affection?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the brief, fervent reply of that Love which had conquered and\nnow controlled me.\n\nTime seemed to stagnate; the sun would not go down; my watch ticked, but\nI thought the hands were paralyzed.\n\n\"What a hot evening!\" I cried, throwing open the lattice; for, indeed, I\nhad seldom felt so feverish. Hearing a step ascending the common stair,\nI wondered whether the \"locataire,\" now mounting to his apartments, were\nas unsettled in mind and condition as I was, or whether he lived in the\ncalm of certain resources, and in the freedom of unfettered feelings.\nWhat! was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in\ninaudible thought? He had actually knocked at the door--at MY door; a\nsmart, prompt rap; and, almost before I could invite him in, he was over\nthe threshold, and had closed the door behind him.\n\n\"And how are you?\" asked an indifferent, quiet voice, in the English\nlanguage; while my visitor, without any sort of bustle or introduction,\nput his hat on the table, and his gloves into his hat, and drawing\nthe only armchair the room afforded a little forward, seated himself\ntranquilly therein.\n\n\"Can't you speak?\" he inquired in a few moments, in a tone whose\nnonchalance seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether\nI answered or not. The fact is, I found it desirable to have recourse to\nmy good friends \"les besicles;\" not exactly to ascertain the identity of\nmy visitor--for I already knew him, confound his impudence! but to see\nhow he looked--to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance.\nI wiped the glasses very deliberately, and put them on quite as\ndeliberately; adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose\nor get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair. I was sitting in the\nwindow-seat, with my back to the light, and I had him VIS-A-VIS; a\nposition he would much rather have had reversed; for, at any time, he\npreferred scrutinizing to being scrutinized. Yes, it was HE, and no\nmistake, with his six feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude;\nwith his dark travelling surtout with its velvet collar, his gray\npantaloons, his black stock, and his face, the most original one Nature\never modelled, yet the least obtrusively so; not one feature that could\nbe termed marked or odd, yet the effect of the whole unique. There is no\nuse in attempting to describe what is indescribable. Being in no hurry\nto address him, I sat and stared at my ease.\n\n\"Oh, that's your game--is it?\" said he at last. \"Well, we'll see which\nis soonest tired.\" And he slowly drew out a fine cigar-case, picked one\nto his taste, lit it, took a book from the shelf convenient to his hand,\nthen leaning back, proceeded to smoke and read as tranquilly as if he\nhad been in his own room, in Grove-street, X---shire, England. I knew\nhe was capable of continuing in that attitude till midnight, if he\nconceived the whim, so I rose, and taking the book from his hand, I\nsaid,--\n\n\"You did not ask for it, and you shall not have it.\"\n\n\"It is silly and dull,\" he observed, \"so I have not lost much;\" then the\nspell being broken, he went on: \"I thought you lived at Pelet's; I went\nthere this afternoon expecting to be starved to death by sitting in\na boarding-school drawing-room, and they told me you were gone, had\ndeparted this morning; you had left your address behind you though,\nwhich I wondered at; it was a more practical and sensible precaution\nthan I should have imagined you capable of. Why did you leave?\"\n\n\"Because M. Pelet has just married the lady whom you and Mr. Brown\nassigned to me as my wife.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" replied Hunsden with a short laugh; \"so you've lost both\nyour wife and your place?\"\n\n\"Precisely so.\"\n\nI saw him give a quick, covert glance all round my room; he marked its\nnarrow limits, its scanty furniture: in an instant he had comprehended\nthe state of matters--had absolved me from the crime of prosperity. A\ncurious effect this discovery wrought in his strange mind; I am morally\ncertain that if he had found me installed in a handsome parlour,\nlounging on a soft couch, with a pretty, wealthy wife at my side, he\nwould have hated me; a brief, cold, haughty visit, would in such a case\nhave been the extreme limit of his civilities, and never would he have\ncome near me more, so long as the tide of fortune bore me smoothly on\nits surface; but the painted furniture, the bare walls, the cheerless\nsolitude of my room relaxed his rigid pride, and I know not what\nsoftening change had taken place both in his voice and look ere he spoke\nagain.\n\n\"You have got another place?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are in the way of getting one?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is bad; have you applied to Brown?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"You had better; he often has it in his power to give useful information\nin such matters.\"\n\n\"He served me once very well; I have no claim on him, and am not in the\nhumour to bother him again.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you're bashful, and dread being intrusive, you need only\ncommission me. I shall see him to-night; I can put in a word.\"\n\n\"I beg you will not, Mr. Hunsden; I am in your debt already; you did me\nan important service when I was at X----; got me out of a den where I\nwas dying: that service I have never repaid, and at present I decline\npositively adding another item to the account.\"\n\n\"If the wind sits that way, I'm satisfied. I thought my unexampled\ngenerosity in turning you out of that accursed counting-house would be\nduly appreciated some day: 'Cast your bread on the waters, and it\nshall be found after many days,' say the Scriptures. Yes, that's right,\nlad--make much of me--I'm a nonpareil: there's nothing like me in the\ncommon herd. In the meantime, to put all humbug aside and talk sense for\na few moments, you would be greatly the better of a situation, and what\nis more, you are a fool if you refuse to take one from any hand that\noffers it.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Hunsden; now you have settled that point, talk of\nsomething else. What news from X----?\"\n\n\"I have not settled that point, or at least there is another to settle\nbefore we get to X----. Is this Miss Zenobie\" (Zoraide, interposed\nI)--\"well, Zoraide--is she really married to Pelet?\"\n\n\"I tell you yes--and if you don't believe me, go and ask the cure of St.\nJacques.\"\n\n\"And your heart is broken?\"\n\n\"I am not aware that it is; it feels all right--beats as usual.\"\n\n\"Then your feelings are less superfine than I took them to be; you must\nbe a coarse, callous character, to bear such a thwack without staggering\nunder it.\"\n\n\"Staggering under it? What the deuce is there to stagger under in the\ncircumstance of a Belgian schoolmistress marrying a French schoolmaster?\nThe progeny will doubtless be a strange hybrid race; but that's their\nlook-out--not mine.\"\n\n\"He indulges in scurrilous jests, and the bride was his affianced one!\"\n\n\"Who said so?\"\n\n\"Brown.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Hunsden--Brown is an old gossip.\"\n\n\"He is; but in the meantime, if his gossip be founded on less than\nfact--if you took no particular interest in Miss Zoraide--why, O\nyouthful pedagogue! did you leave your place in consequence of her\nbecoming Madame Pelet?\"\n\n\"Because--\" I felt my face grow a little hot; \"because--in short, Mr.\nHunsden, I decline answering any more questions,\" and I plunged my hands\ndeep in my breeches pocket.\n\nHunsden triumphed: his eyes--his laugh announced victory.\n\n\"What the deuce are you laughing at, Mr. Hunsden?\"\n\n\"At your exemplary composure. Well, lad, I'll not bore you; I see how\nit is: Zoraide has jilted you--married some one richer, as any sensible\nwoman would have done if she had had the chance.\"\n\nI made no reply--I let him think so, not feeling inclined to enter into\nan explanation of the real state of things, and as little to forge a\nfalse account; but it was not easy to blind Hunsden; my very silence,\ninstead of convincing him that he had hit the truth, seemed to render\nhim doubtful about it; he went on:--\n\n\"I suppose the affair has been conducted as such affairs always\nare amongst rational people: you offered her your youth and your\ntalents--such as they are--in exchange for her position and money: I\ndon't suppose you took appearance, or what is called LOVE, into the\naccount--for I understand she is older than you, and Brown says, rather\nsensible-looking than beautiful. She, having then no chance of making\na better bargain, was at first inclined to come to terms with you, but\nPelet--the head of a flourishing school--stepped in with a higher bid;\nshe accepted, and he has got her: a correct transaction--perfectly\nso--business-like and legitimate. And now we'll talk of something else.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said I, very glad to dismiss the topic, and especially glad to\nhave baffled the sagacity of my cross-questioner--if, indeed, I had\nbaffled it; for though his words now led away from the dangerous point,\nhis eyes, keen and watchful, seemed still preoccupied with the former\nidea.\n\n\"You want to hear news from X----? And what interest can you have in\nX----? You left no friends there, for you made none. Nobody ever asks\nafter you--neither man nor woman; and if I mention your name in company,\nthe men look as if I had spoken of Prester John; and the women sneer\ncovertly. Our X---- belles must have disliked you. How did you excite\ntheir displeasure?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I seldom spoke to them--they were nothing to me. I\nconsidered them only as something to be glanced at from a distance;\ntheir dresses and faces were often pleasing enough to the eye: but\nI could not understand their conversation, nor even read their\ncountenances. When I caught snatches of what they said, I could never\nmake much of it; and the play of their lips and eyes did not help me at\nall.\"\n\n\"That was your fault, not theirs. There are sensible, as well as\nhandsome women in X----; women it is worth any man's while to talk to,\nand with whom I can talk with pleasure: but you had and have no pleasant\naddress; there is nothing in you to induce a woman to be affable. I have\nremarked you sitting near the door in a room full of company, bent on\nhearing, not on speaking; on observing, not on entertaining; looking\nfrigidly shy at the commencement of a party, confusingly vigilant about\nthe middle, and insultingly weary towards the end. Is that the way, do\nyou think, ever to communicate pleasure or excite interest? No; and if\nyou are generally unpopular, it is because you deserve to be so.\"\n\n\"Content!\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"No, you are not content; you see beauty always turning its back on\nyou; you are mortified and then you sneer. I verily believe all that is\ndesirable on earth--wealth, reputation, love--will for ever to you be\nthe ripe grapes on the high trellis: you'll look up at them; they will\ntantalize in you the lust of the eye; but they are out of reach: you\nhave not the address to fetch a ladder, and you'll go away calling them\nsour.\"\n\nCutting as these words might have been under some circumstances, they\ndrew no blood now. My life was changed; my experience had been varied\nsince I left X----, but Hunsden could not know this; he had seen me only\nin the character of Mr. Crimsworth's clerk--a dependant amongst wealthy\nstrangers, meeting disdain with a hard front, conscious of an unsocial\nand unattractive exterior, refusing to sue for notice which I was sure\nwould be withheld, declining to evince an admiration which I knew would\nbe scorned as worthless. He could not be aware that since then youth and\nloveliness had been to me everyday objects; that I had studied them at\nleisure and closely, and had seen the plain texture of truth under\nthe embroidery of appearance; nor could he, keen-sighted as he\nwas, penetrate into my heart, search my brain, and read my peculiar\nsympathies and antipathies; he had not known me long enough, or well\nenough, to perceive how low my feelings would ebb under some influences,\npowerful over most minds; how high, how fast they would flow under\nother influences, that perhaps acted with the more intense force on me,\nbecause they acted on me alone. Neither could he suspect for an instant\nthe history of my communications with Mdlle. Reuter; secret to him\nand to all others was the tale of her strange infatuation; her\nblandishments, her wiles had been seen but by me, and to me only were\nthey known; but they had changed me, for they had proved that I COULD\nimpress. A sweeter secret nestled deeper in my heart; one full of\ntenderness and as full of strength: it took the sting out of Hunsden's\nsarcasm; it kept me unbent by shame, and unstirred by wrath. But of all\nthis I could say nothing--nothing decisive at least; uncertainty sealed\nmy lips, and during the interval of silence by which alone I replied to\nMr. Hunsden, I made up my mind to be for the present wholly misjudged\nby him, and misjudged I was; he thought he had been rather too hard\nupon me, and that I was crushed by the weight of his upbraidings; so to\nre-assure me he said, doubtless I should mend some day; I was only at\nthe beginning of life yet; and since happily I was not quite without\nsense, every false step I made would be a good lesson.\n\nJust then I turned my face a little to the light; the approach of\ntwilight, and my position in the window-seat, had, for the last ten\nminutes, prevented him from studying my countenance; as I moved,\nhowever, he caught an expression which he thus interpreted:--\n\n\"Confound it! How doggedly self-approving the lad looks! I thought he\nwas fit to die with shame, and there he sits grinning smiles, as good as\nto say, 'Let the world wag as it will, I've the philosopher's stone\nin my waist-coat pocket, and the elixir of life in my cupboard; I'm\nindependent of both Fate and Fortune.'\"\n\n\"Hunsden--you spoke of grapes; I was thinking of a fruit I like better\nthan your X---- hot-house grapes--an unique fruit, growing wild, which I\nhave marked as my own, and hope one day to gather and taste. It is of no\nuse your offering me the draught of bitterness, or threatening me with\ndeath by thirst: I have the anticipation of sweetness on my palate; the\nhope of freshness on my lips; I can reject the unsavoury, and endure the\nexhausting.\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"Till the next opportunity for effort; and as the prize of success will\nbe a treasure after my own heart, I'll bring a bull's strength to the\nstruggle.\"\n\n\"Bad luck crushes bulls as easily as bullaces; and, I believe, the fury\ndogs you: you were born with a wooden spoon in your mouth, depend on\nit.\"\n\n\"I believe you; and I mean to make my wooden spoon do the work of some\npeople's silver ladles: grasped firmly, and handled nimbly, even a\nwooden spoon will shovel up broth.\"\n\nHunsden rose: \"I see,\" said he; \"I suppose you're one of those who\ndevelop best unwatched, and act best unaided--work your own way. Now,\nI'll go.\" And, without another word, he was going; at the door he\nturned:--\n\n\"Crimsworth Hall is sold,\" said he.\n\n\"Sold!\" was my echo.\n\n\"Yes; you know, of course, that your brother failed three months ago?\"\n\n\"What! Edward Crimsworth?\"\n\n\"Precisely; and his wife went home to her father's; when affairs went\nawry, his temper sympathized with them; he used her ill; I told you he\nwould be a tyrant to her some day; as to him--\"\n\n\"Ay, as to him--what is become of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing extraordinary--don't be alarmed; he put himself under the\nprotection of the court, compounded with his creditors--tenpence in\nthe pound; in six weeks set up again, coaxed back his wife, and is\nflourishing like a green bay-tree.\"\n\n\"And Crimsworth Hall--was the furniture sold too?\"\n\n\"Everything--from the grand piano down to the rolling-pin.\"\n\n\"And the contents of the oak dining-room--were they sold?\"\n\n\"Of course; why should the sofas and chairs of that room be held more\nsacred than those of any other?\"\n\n\"And the pictures?\"\n\n\"What pictures? Crimsworth had no special collection that I know of--he\ndid not profess to be an amateur.\"\n\n\"There were two portraits, one on each side the mantelpiece; you cannot\nhave forgotten them, Mr. Hunsden; you once noticed that of the lady--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know! the thin-faced gentlewoman with a shawl put on like\ndrapery.--Why, as a matter of course, it would be sold among the other\nthings. If you had been rich, you might have bought it, for I remember\nyou said it represented your mother: you see what it is to be without a\nsou.\"\n\nI did. \"But surely,\" I thought to myself, \"I shall not always be so\npoverty-stricken; I may one day buy it back yet.--Who purchased it? do\nyou know?\" I asked.\n\n\"How is it likely? I never inquired who purchased anything; there spoke\nthe unpractical man--to imagine all the world is interested in what\ninterests himself! Now, good night--I'm off for Germany to-morrow\nmorning; I shall be back here in six weeks, and possibly I may call\nand see you again; I wonder whether you'll be still out of place!\"\nhe laughed, as mockingly, as heartlessly as Mephistopheles, and so\nlaughing, vanished.\n\nSome people, however indifferent they may become after a considerable\nspace of absence, always contrive to leave a pleasant impression just\nat parting; not so Hunsden, a conference with him affected one like a\ndraught of Peruvian bark; it seemed a concentration of the specially\nharsh, stringent, bitter; whether, like bark, it invigorated, I scarcely\nknew.\n\nA ruffled mind makes a restless pillow; I slept little on the night\nafter this interview; towards morning I began to doze, but hardly had my\nslumber become sleep, when I was roused from it by hearing a noise in\nmy sitting room, to which my bed-room adjoined--a step, and a shoving of\nfurniture; the movement lasted barely two minutes; with the closing\nof the door it ceased. I listened; not a mouse stirred; perhaps I\nhad dreamt it; perhaps a locataire had made a mistake, and entered my\napartment instead of his own. It was yet but five o'clock; neither I nor\nthe day were wide awake; I turned, and was soon unconscious. When I did\nrise, about two hours later, I had forgotten the circumstance; the first\nthing I saw, however, on quitting my chamber, recalled it; just pushed\nin at the door of my sitting-room, and still standing on end, was a\nwooden packing-case--a rough deal affair, wide but shallow; a porter\nhad doubtless shoved it forward, but seeing no occupant of the room, had\nleft it at the entrance.\n\n\"That is none of mine,\" thought I, approaching; \"it must be meant for\nsomebody else.\" I stooped to examine the address:--\n\n\"Wm. Crimsworth, Esq., No --, -- St., Brussels.\"\n\nI was puzzled, but concluding that the best way to obtain information\nwas to ask within, I cut the cords and opened the case. Green baize\nenveloped its contents, sewn carefully at the sides; I ripped the\npack-thread with my pen-knife, and still, as the seam gave way, glimpses\nof gilding appeared through the widening interstices. Boards and baize\nbeing at length removed, I lifted from the case a large picture, in a\nmagnificent frame; leaning it against a chair, in a position where the\nlight from the window fell favourably upon it, I stepped back--already I\nhad mounted my spectacles. A portrait-painter's sky (the most sombre and\nthreatening of welkins), and distant trees of a conventional depth of\nhue, raised in full relief a pale, pensive-looking female face, shadowed\nwith soft dark hair, almost blending with the equally dark clouds;\nlarge, solemn eyes looked reflectively into mine; a thin cheek rested\non a delicate little hand; a shawl, artistically draped, half hid, half\nshowed a slight figure. A listener (had there been one) might have heard\nme, after ten minutes' silent gazing, utter the word \"Mother!\" I might\nhave said more--but with me, the first word uttered aloud in soliloquy\nrouses consciousness; it reminds me that only crazy people talk to\nthemselves, and then I think out my monologue, instead of speaking it.\nI had thought a long while, and a long while had contemplated the\nintelligence, the sweetness, and--alas! the sadness also of those fine,\ngrey eyes, the mental power of that forehead, and the rare sensibility\nof that serious mouth, when my glance, travelling downwards, fell on a\nnarrow billet, stuck in the corner of the picture, between the frame and\nthe canvas. Then I first asked, \"Who sent this picture? Who thought of\nme, saved it out of the wreck of Crimsworth Hall, and now commits it to\nthe care of its natural keeper?\" I took the note from its niche; thus it\nspoke:--\n\n\"There is a sort of stupid pleasure in giving a child sweets, a fool his\nbells, a dog a bone. You are repaid by seeing the child besmear his face\nwith sugar; by witnessing how the fool's ecstasy makes a greater fool of\nhim than ever; by watching the dog's nature come out over his bone.\nIn giving William Crimsworth his mother's picture, I give him sweets,\nbells, and bone all in one; what grieves me is, that I cannot behold\nthe result; I would have added five shillings more to my bid if the\nauctioneer could only have promised me that pleasure.\n\n\"H. Y. H.\n\n\"P.S.--You said last night you positively declined adding another item\nto your account with me; don't you think I've saved you that trouble?\"\n\nI muffled the picture in its green baize covering, restored it to the\ncase, and having transported the whole concern to my bed-room, put it\nout of sight under my bed. My pleasure was now poisoned by pungent pain;\nI determined to look no more till I could look at my ease. If Hunsden\nhad come in at that moment, I should have said to him, \"I owe you\nnothing, Hunsden--not a fraction of a farthing: you have paid yourself\nin taunts!\"\n\nToo anxious to remain any longer quiescent, I had no sooner breakfasted,\nthan I repaired once more to M. Vandenhuten's, scarcely hoping to find\nhim at home; for a week had barely elapsed since my first call: but\nfancying I might be able to glean information as to the time when his\nreturn was expected. A better result awaited me than I had anticipated,\nfor though the family were yet at Ostend, M. Vandenhuten had come over\nto Brussels on business for the day. He received me with the quiet\nkindness of a sincere though not excitable man. I had not sat five\nminutes alone with him in his bureau, before I became aware of a sense\nof ease in his presence, such as I rarely experienced with strangers.\nI was surprised at my own composure, for, after all, I had come on\nbusiness to me exceedingly painful--that of soliciting a favour. I asked\non what basis the calm rested--I feared it might be deceptive. Ere long\nI caught a glimpse of the ground, and at once I felt assured of its\nsolidity; I knew where it was.\n\nM. Vandenhuten was rich, respected, and influential; I, poor, despised\nand powerless; so we stood to the world at large as members of the\nworld's society; but to each other, as a pair of human beings, our\npositions were reversed. The Dutchman (he was not Flamand, but pure\nHollandais) was slow, cool, of rather dense intelligence, though sound\nand accurate judgment; the Englishman far more nervous, active, quicker\nboth to plan and to practise, to conceive and to realize. The Dutchman\nwas benevolent, the Englishman susceptible; in short our characters\ndovetailed, but my mind having more fire and action than his,\ninstinctively assumed and kept the predominance.\n\nThis point settled, and my position well ascertained, I addressed him\non the subject of my affairs with that genuine frankness which full\nconfidence can alone inspire. It was a pleasure to him to be so appealed\nto; he thanked me for giving him this opportunity of using a little\nexertion in my behalf. I went on to explain to him that my wish was not\nso much to be helped, as to be put into the way of helping myself;\nof him I did not want exertion--that was to be my part--but only\ninformation and recommendation. Soon after I rose to go. He held out his\nhand at parting--an action of greater significance with foreigners\nthan with Englishmen. As I exchanged a smile with him, I thought the\nbenevolence of his truthful face was better than the intelligence of my\nown. Characters of my order experience a balm-like solace in the contact\nof such souls as animated the honest breast of Victor Vandenhuten.\n\nThe next fortnight was a period of many alternations; my existence\nduring its lapse resembled a sky of one of those autumnal nights which\nare specially haunted by meteors and falling stars. Hopes and fears,\nexpectations and disappointments, descended in glancing showers from\nzenith to horizon; but all were transient, and darkness followed swift\neach vanishing apparition. M. Vandenhuten aided me faithfully; he set me\non the track of several places, and himself made efforts to secure\nthem for me; but for a long time solicitation and recommendation were\nvain--the door either shut in my face when I was about to walk in,\nor another candidate, entering before me, rendered my further advance\nuseless. Feverish and roused, no disappointment arrested me; defeat\nfollowing fast on defeat served as stimulants to will. I forgot\nfastidiousness, conquered reserve, thrust pride from me: I asked, I\npersevered, I remonstrated, I dunned. It is so that openings are forced\ninto the guarded circle where Fortune sits dealing favours round. My\nperseverance made me known; my importunity made me remarked. I was\ninquired about; my former pupils' parents, gathering the reports of\ntheir children, heard me spoken of as talented, and they echoed the\nword: the sound, bandied about at random, came at last to ears which,\nbut for its universality, it might never have reached; and at the very\ncrisis when I had tried my last effort and knew not what to do, Fortune\nlooked in at me one morning, as I sat in drear and almost desperate\ndeliberation on my bedstead, nodded with the familiarity of an old\nacquaintance--though God knows I had never met her before--and threw a\nprize into my lap.\n\nIn the second week of October, 18--, I got the appointment of English\nprofessor to all the classes of ---- College, Brussels, with a salary\nof three thousand francs per annum; and the certainty of being able, by\ndint of the reputation and publicity accompanying the position, to make\nas much more by private means. The official notice, which communicated\nthis information, mentioned also that it was the strong recommendation\nof M. Vandenhuten, negociant, which had turned the scale of choice in my\nfavour.\n\nNo sooner had I read the announcement than I hurried to M. Vandenhuten's\nbureau, pushed the document under his nose, and when he had perused\nit, took both his hands, and thanked him with unrestrained vivacity.\nMy vivid words and emphatic gesture moved his Dutch calm to unwonted\nsensation. He said he was happy--glad to have served me; but he had\ndone nothing meriting such thanks. He had not laid out a centime--only\nscratched a few words on a sheet of paper.\n\nAgain I repeated to him--\n\n\"You have made me quite happy, and in a way that suits me; I do not\nfeel an obligation irksome, conferred by your kind hand; I do not feel\ndisposed to shun you because you have done me a favour; from this day\nyou must consent to admit me to your intimate acquaintance, for I shall\nhereafter recur again and again to the pleasure of your society.\"\n\n\"Ainsi soit-il,\" was the reply, accompanied by a smile of benignant\ncontent. I went away with its sunshine in my heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nIT was two o'clock when I returned to my lodgings; my dinner, just\nbrought in from a neighbouring hotel, smoked on the table; I sat down\nthinking to eat--had the plate been heaped with potsherds and broken\nglass, instead of boiled beef and haricots, I could not have made a more\nsignal failure: appetite had forsaken me. Impatient of seeing food\nwhich I could not taste, I put it all aside into a cupboard, and then\ndemanded, \"What shall I do till evening?\" for before six P.M. it would\nbe vain to seek the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges; its inhabitant (for me\nit had but one) was detained by her vocation elsewhere. I walked in the\nstreets of Brussels, and I walked in my own room from two o'clock\ntill six; never once in that space of time did I sit down. I was in my\nchamber when the last-named hour struck; I had just bathed my face and\nfeverish hands, and was standing near the glass; my cheek was crimson,\nmy eye was flame, still all my features looked quite settled and\ncalm. Descending swiftly the stair and stepping out, I was glad to see\nTwilight drawing on in clouds; such shade was to me like a grateful\nscreen, and the chill of latter Autumn, breathing in a fitful wind from\nthe north-west, met me as a refreshing coolness. Still I saw it was cold\nto others, for the women I passed were wrapped in shawls, and the men\nhad their coats buttoned close.\n\nWhen are we quite happy? Was I so then? No; an urgent and growing dread\nworried my nerves, and had worried them since the first moment good\ntidings had reached me. How was Frances? It was ten weeks since I had\nseen her, six since I had heard from her, or of her. I had answered\nher letter by a brief note, friendly but calm, in which no mention of\ncontinued correspondence or further visits was made. At that hour my\nbark hung on the topmost curl of a wave of fate, and I knew not on what\nshoal the onward rush of the billow might hurl it; I would not then\nattach her destiny to mine by the slightest thread; if doomed to split\non the rock, or run aground on the sand-bank, I was resolved no other\nvessel should share my disaster: but six weeks was a long time; and\ncould it be that she was still well and doing well? Were not all sages\nagreed in declaring that happiness finds no climax on earth? Dared\nI think that but half a street now divided me from the full cup of\ncontentment--the draught drawn from waters said to flow only in heaven?\n\nI was at the door; I entered the quiet house; I mounted the stairs; the\nlobby was void and still, all the doors closed; I looked for the neat\ngreen mat; it lay duly in its place.\n\n\"Signal of hope!\" I said, and advanced. \"But I will be a little calmer;\nI am not going to rush in, and get up a scene directly.\" Forcibly\nstaying my eager step, I paused on the mat.\n\n\"What an absolute hush! Is she in? Is anybody in?\" I demanded to\nmyself. A little tinkle, as of cinders falling from a grate, replied;\na movement--a fire was gently stirred; and the slight rustle of life\ncontinuing, a step paced equably backwards and forwards, backwards and\nforwards, in the apartment. Fascinated, I stood, more fixedly fascinated\nwhen a voice rewarded the attention of my strained ear--so low, so\nself-addressed, I never fancied the speaker otherwise than alone;\nsolitude might speak thus in a desert, or in the hall of a forsaken\nhouse.\n\n\n    \"'And ne'er but once, my son,' he said,\n      'Was yon dark cavern trod;\n      In persecution's iron days,\n       When the land was left by God.\n      From Bewley's bog, with slaughter red,\n       A wanderer hither drew;\n      And oft he stopp'd and turn'd his head,\n       As by fits the night-winds blew.\n      For trampling round by Cheviot-edge\n       Were heard the troopers keen;\n      And frequent from the Whitelaw ridge\n       The death-shot flash'd between.'\" etc. etc.\n\nThe old Scotch ballad was partly recited, then dropt; a pause ensued;\nthen another strain followed, in French, of which the purport,\ntranslated, ran as follows:--\n\n\n     I gave, at first, attention close;\n      Then interest warm ensued;\n     From interest, as improvement rose,\n      Succeeded gratitude.\n\n     Obedience was no effort soon,\n      And labour was no pain;\n     If tired, a word, a glance alone\n      Would give me strength again.\n\n     From others of the studious band,\n      Ere long he singled me;\n     But only by more close demand,\n      And sterner urgency.\n\n     The task he from another took,\n      From me he did reject;\n     He would no slight omission brook,\n      And suffer no defect.\n\n     If my companions went astray,\n      He scarce their wanderings blam'd;\n     If I but falter'd in the way,\n      His anger fiercely flam'd.\n\nSomething stirred in an adjoining chamber; it would not do to be\nsurprised eaves-dropping; I tapped hastily, and as hastily entered.\nFrances was just before me; she had been walking slowly in her room,\nand her step was checked by my advent: Twilight only was with her, and\ntranquil, ruddy Firelight; to these sisters, the Bright and the Dark,\nshe had been speaking, ere I entered, in poetry. Sir Walter Scott's\nvoice, to her a foreign, far-off sound, a mountain echo, had uttered\nitself in the first stanzas; the second, I thought, from the style and\nthe substance, was the language of her own heart. Her face was grave,\nits expression concentrated; she bent on me an unsmiling eye--an eye\njust returning from abstraction, just awaking from dreams: well-arranged\nwas her simple attire, smooth her dark hair, orderly her tranquil room;\nbut what--with her thoughtful look, her serious self-reliance, her\nbent to meditation and haply inspiration--what had she to do with love?\n\"Nothing,\" was the answer of her own sad, though gentle countenance; it\nseemed to say, \"I must cultivate fortitude and cling to poetry; one is\nto be my support and the other my solace through life. Human affections\ndo not bloom, nor do human passions glow for me.\" Other women have such\nthoughts. Frances, had she been as desolate as she deemed, would not\nhave been worse off than thousands of her sex. Look at the rigid and\nformal race of old maids--the race whom all despise; they have fed\nthemselves, from youth upwards, on maxims of resignation and endurance.\nMany of them get ossified with the dry diet; self-control is so\ncontinually their thought, so perpetually their object, that at last\nit absorbs the softer and more agreeable qualities of their nature; and\nthey die mere models of austerity, fashioned out of a little parchment\nand much bone. Anatomists will tell you that there is a heart in the\nwithered old maid's carcass--the same as in that of any cherished wife\nor proud mother in the land. Can this be so? I really don't know; but\nfeel inclined to doubt it.\n\nI came forward, bade Frances \"good evening,\" and took my seat. The chair\nI had chosen was one she had probably just left; it stood by a little\ntable where were her open desk and papers. I know not whether she had\nfully recognized me at first, but she did so now; and in a voice, soft\nbut quiet, she returned my greeting. I had shown no eagerness; she took\nher cue from me, and evinced no surprise. We met as we had always met,\nas master and pupil--nothing more. I proceeded to handle the papers;\nFrances, observant and serviceable, stepped into an inner room, brought\na candle, lit it, placed it by me; then drew the curtain over the\nlattice, and having added a little fresh fuel to the already bright\nfire, she drew a second chair to the table and sat down at my right\nhand, a little removed. The paper on the top was a translation of\nsome grave French author into English, but underneath lay a sheet with\nstanzas; on this I laid hands. Frances half rose, made a movement to\nrecover the captured spoil, saying, that was nothing--a mere copy of\nverses. I put by resistance with the decision I knew she never long\nopposed; but on this occasion her fingers had fastened on the paper. I\nhad quietly to unloose them; their hold dissolved to my touch; her hand\nshrunk away; my own would fain have followed it, but for the present I\nforbade such impulse. The first page of the sheet was occupied with\nthe lines I had overheard; the sequel was not exactly the writer's own\nexperience, but a composition by portions of that experience suggested.\nThus while egotism was avoided, the fancy was exercised, and the heart\nsatisfied. I translate as before, and my translation is nearly literal;\nit continued thus:--\n\n\n     When sickness stay'd awhile my course,\n      He seem'd impatient still,\n     Because his pupil's flagging force\n      Could not obey his will.\n\n     One day when summoned to the bed\n      Where pain and I did strive,\n     I heard him, as he bent his head,\n      Say, \"God, she must revive!\"\n\n     I felt his hand, with gentle stress,\n      A moment laid on mine,\n     And wished to mark my consciousness\n      By some responsive sign.\n\n     But pow'rless then to speak or move,\n      I only felt, within,\n     The sense of Hope, the strength of Love,\n      Their healing work begin.\n\n     And as he from the room withdrew,\n      My heart his steps pursued;\n     I long'd to prove, by efforts new;\n      My speechless gratitude.\n\n     When once again I took my place,\n      Long vacant, in the class,\n     Th' unfrequent smile across his face\n      Did for one moment pass.\n\n     The lessons done; the signal made\n      Of glad release and play,\n     He, as he passed, an instant stay'd,\n      One kindly word to say.\n\n    \"Jane, till to-morrow you are free\n      From tedious task and rule;\n     This afternoon I must not see\n      That yet pale face in school.\n\n    \"Seek in the garden-shades a seat,\n      Far from the play-ground din;\n     The sun is warm, the air is sweet:\n      Stay till I call you in.\"\n\n     A long and pleasant afternoon\n      I passed in those green bowers;\n     All silent, tranquil, and alone\n      With birds, and bees, and flowers.\n\n     Yet, when my master's voice I heard\n      Call, from the window, \"Jane!\"\n     I entered, joyful, at the word,\n      The busy house again.\n\n     He, in the hall, paced up and down;\n      He paused as I passed by;\n     His forehead stern relaxed its frown:\n      He raised his deep-set eye.\n\n    \"Not quite so pale,\" he murmured low.\n      \"Now Jane, go rest awhile.\"\n     And as I smiled, his smoothened brow\n      Returned as glad a smile.\n\n     My perfect health restored, he took\n      His mien austere again;\n     And, as before, he would not brook\n      The slightest fault from Jane.\n\n     The longest task, the hardest theme\n      Fell to my share as erst,\n     And still I toiled to place my name\n      In every study first.\n\n     He yet begrudged and stinted praise,\n      But I had learnt to read\n     The secret meaning of his face,\n      And that was my best meed.\n\n     Even when his hasty temper spoke\n      In tones that sorrow stirred,\n     My grief was lulled as soon as woke\n      By some relenting word.\n\n     And when he lent some precious book,\n      Or gave some fragrant flower,\n     I did not quail to Envy's look,\n      Upheld by Pleasure's power.\n\n     At last our school ranks took their ground,\n      The hard-fought field I won;\n     The prize, a laurel-wreath, was bound\n      My throbbing forehead on.\n\n     Low at my master's knee I bent,\n      The offered crown to meet;\n     Its green leaves through my temples sent\n      A thrill as wild as sweet.\n\n     The strong pulse of Ambition struck\n      In every vein I owned;\n     At the same instant, bleeding broke\n      A secret, inward wound.\n\n     The hour of triumph was to me\n      The hour of sorrow sore;\n     A day hence I must cross the sea,\n      Ne'er to recross it more.\n\n     An hour hence, in my master's room\n      I with him sat alone,\n     And told him what a dreary gloom\n      O'er joy had parting thrown.\n\n     He little said; the time was brief,\n      The ship was soon to sail,\n     And while I sobbed in bitter grief,\n      My master but looked pale.\n\n     They called in haste; he bade me go,\n      Then snatched me back again;\n     He held me fast and murmured low,\n     \"Why will they part us, Jane?\"\n\n    \"Were you not happy in my care?\n      Did I not faithful prove?\n     Will others to my darling bear\n      As true, as deep a love?\n\n    \"O God, watch o'er my foster child!\n      O guard her gentle head!\n     When minds are high and tempests wild\n      Protection round her spread!\n\n    \"They call again; leave then my breast;\n      Quit thy true shelter, Jane;\n     But when deceived, repulsed, opprest,\n      Come home to me again!\"\n\nI read--then dreamily made marks on the margin with my pencil; thinking\nall the while of other things; thinking that \"Jane\" was now at my side;\nno child, but a girl of nineteen; and she might be mine, so my heart\naffirmed; Poverty's curse was taken off me; Envy and Jealousy were\nfar away, and unapprized of this our quiet meeting; the frost of the\nMaster's manner might melt; I felt the thaw coming fast, whether I would\nor not; no further need for the eye to practise a hard look, for the\nbrow to compress its expanse into a stern fold: it was now permitted\nto suffer the outward revelation of the inward glow--to seek, demand,\nelicit an answering ardour. While musing thus, I thought that the grass\non Hermon never drank the fresh dews of sunset more gratefully than my\nfeelings drank the bliss of this hour.\n\nFrances rose, as if restless; she passed before me to stir the fire,\nwhich did not want stirring; she lifted and put down the little\nornaments on the mantelpiece; her dress waved within a yard of me;\nslight, straight, and elegant, she stood erect on the hearth.\n\nThere are impulses we can control; but there are others which control\nus, because they attain us with a tiger-leap, and are our masters ere\nwe have seen them. Perhaps, though, such impulses are seldom altogether\nbad; perhaps Reason, by a process as brief as quiet, a process that\nis finished ere felt, has ascertained the sanity of the deed Instinct\nmeditates, and feels justified in remaining passive while it is\nperformed. I know I did not reason, I did not plan or intend, yet,\nwhereas one moment I was sitting solus on the chair near the table,\nthe next, I held Frances on my knee, placed there with sharpness and\ndecision, and retained with exceeding tenacity.\n\n\"Monsieur!\" cried Frances, and was still: not another word escaped her\nlips; sorely confounded she seemed during the lapse of the first few\nmoments; but the amazement soon subsided; terror did not succeed, nor\nfury: after all, she was only a little nearer than she had ever been\nbefore, to one she habitually respected and trusted; embarrassment might\nhave impelled her to contend, but self-respect checked resistance where\nresistance was useless.\n\n\"Frances, how much regard have you for me?\" was my demand. No answer;\nthe situation was yet too new and surprising to permit speech. On this\nconsideration, I compelled myself for some seconds to tolerate her\nsilence, though impatient of it: presently, I repeated the same\nquestion--probably, not in the calmest of tones; she looked at me; my\nface, doubtless, was no model of composure, my eyes no still wells of\ntranquillity.\n\n\"Do speak,\" I urged; and a very low, hurried, yet still arch voice\nsaid--\n\n\"Monsieur, vous me faites mal; de grace lachez un peu ma main droite.\"\n\nIn truth I became aware that I was holding the said \"main droite\" in\na somewhat ruthless grasp: I did as desired; and, for the third time,\nasked more gently--\n\n\"Frances, how much regard have you for me?\"\n\n\"Mon maitre, j'en ai beaucoup,\" was the truthful rejoinder.\n\n\"Frances, have you enough to give yourself to me as my wife?--to accept\nme as your husband?\"\n\nI felt the agitation of the heart, I saw \"the purple light of love\" cast\nits glowing reflection on cheeks, temples, neck; I desired to consult\nthe eye, but sheltering lash and lid forbade.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the soft voice at last,--\"Monsieur desire savoir si je\nconsens--si--enfin, si je veux me marier avec lui?\"\n\n\"Justement.\"\n\n\"Monsieur sera-t-il aussi bon mari qu'il a ete bon maitre?\"\n\n\"I will try, Frances.\"\n\nA pause; then with a new, yet still subdued inflexion of the voice--an\ninflexion which provoked while it pleased me--accompanied, too, by a\n\"sourire a la fois fin et timide\" in perfect harmony with the tone:--\n\n\"C'est a dire, monsieur sera toujours un peu entete exigeant,\nvolontaire--?\"\n\n\"Have I been so, Frances?\"\n\n\"Mais oui; vous le savez bien.\"\n\n\"Have I been nothing else?\"\n\n\"Mais oui; vous avez ete mon meilleur ami.\"\n\n\"And what, Frances, are you to me?\"\n\n\"Votre devouee eleve, qui vous aime de tout son coeur.\"\n\n\"Will my pupil consent to pass her life with me? Speak English now,\nFrances.\"\n\nSome moments were taken for reflection; the answer, pronounced slowly,\nran thus:--\n\n\"You have always made me happy; I like to hear you speak; I like to\nsee you; I like to be near you; I believe you are very good, and very\nsuperior; I know you are stern to those who are careless and idle, but\nyou are kind, very kind to the attentive and industrious, even if they\nare not clever. Master, I should be GLAD to live with you always;\"\nand she made a sort of movement, as if she would have clung to me, but\nrestraining herself she only added with earnest emphasis--\"Master, I\nconsent to pass my life with you.\"\n\n\"Very well, Frances.\"\n\nI drew her a little nearer to my heart; I took a first kiss from her\nlips, thereby sealing the compact, now framed between us; afterwards she\nand I were silent, nor was our silence brief. Frances' thoughts, during\nthis interval, I know not, nor did I attempt to guess them; I was not\noccupied in searching her countenance, nor in otherwise troubling her\ncomposure. The peace I felt, I wished her to feel; my arm, it is true,\nstill detained her; but with a restraint that was gentle enough, so long\nas no opposition tightened it. My gaze was on the red fire; my heart was\nmeasuring its own content; it sounded and sounded, and found the depth\nfathomless.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" at last said my quiet companion, as stirless in her\nhappiness as a mouse in its terror. Even now in speaking she scarcely\nlifted her head.\n\n\"Well, Frances?\" I like unexaggerated intercourse; it is not my way to\noverpower with amorous epithets, any more than to worry with selfishly\nimportunate caresses.\n\n\"Monsieur est raisonnable, n'est-ce pas?\"\n\n\"Yes; especially when I am requested to be so in English: but why do\nyou ask me? You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner; am I not\ntranquil enough?\"\n\n\"Ce n'est pas cela--\" began Frances.\n\n\"English!\" I reminded her.\n\n\"Well, monsieur, I wished merely to say, that I should like, of course,\nto retain my employment of teaching. You will teach still, I suppose,\nmonsieur?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! It is all I have to depend on.\"\n\n\"Bon!--I mean good. Thus we shall have both the same profession. I like\nthat; and my efforts to get on will be as unrestrained as yours--will\nthey not, monsieur?\"\n\n\"You are laying plans to be independent of me,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; I must be no incumbrance to you--no burden in any way.\"\n\n\"But, Frances, I have not yet told you what my prospects are. I have\nleft M. Pelet's; and after nearly a month's seeking, I have got another\nplace, with a salary of three thousand francs a year, which I can easily\ndouble by a little additional exertion. Thus you see it would be useless\nfor you to fag yourself by going out to give lessons; on six thousand\nfrancs you and I can live, and live well.\"\n\nFrances seemed to consider. There is something flattering to man's\nstrength, something consonant to his honourable pride, in the idea of\nbecoming the providence of what he loves--feeding and clothing it, as\nGod does the lilies of the field. So, to decide her resolution, I went\non:--\n\n\"Life has been painful and laborious enough to you so far, Frances; you\nrequire complete rest; your twelve hundred francs would not form a very\nimportant addition to our income, and what sacrifice of comfort to earn\nit! Relinquish your labours: you must be weary, and let me have the\nhappiness of giving you rest.\"\n\nI am not sure whether Frances had accorded due attention to my harangue;\ninstead of answering me with her usual respectful promptitude, she only\nsighed and said,--\n\n\"How rich you are, monsieur!\" and then she stirred uneasy in my\narms. \"Three thousand francs!\" she murmured, \"While I get only twelve\nhundred!\" She went on faster. \"However, it must be so for the present;\nand, monsieur, were you not saying something about my giving up my\nplace? Oh no! I shall hold it fast;\" and her little fingers emphatically\ntightened on mine.\n\n\"Think of my marrying you to be kept by you, monsieur! I could not do\nit; and how dull my days would be! You would be away teaching in close,\nnoisy school-rooms, from morning till evening, and I should be lingering\nat home, unemployed and solitary; I should get depressed and sullen, and\nyou would soon tire of me.\"\n\n\"Frances, you could read and study--two things you like so well.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I could not; I like a contemplative life, but I like an\nactive life better; I must act in some way, and act with you. I have\ntaken notice, monsieur, that people who are only in each other's company\nfor amusement, never really like each other so well, or esteem each\nother so highly, as those who work together, and perhaps suffer\ntogether.\"\n\n\"You speak God's truth,\" said I at last, \"and you shall have your own\nway, for it is the best way. Now, as a reward for such ready consent,\ngive me a voluntary kiss.\"\n\nAfter some hesitation, natural to a novice in the art of kissing, she\nbrought her lips into very shy and gentle contact with my forehead; I\ntook the small gift as a loan, and repaid it promptly, and with generous\ninterest.\n\nI know not whether Frances was really much altered since the time\nI first saw her; but, as I looked at her now, I felt that she was\nsingularly changed for me; the sad eye, the pale cheek, the dejected\nand joyless countenance I remembered as her early attributes, were quite\ngone, and now I saw a face dressed in graces; smile, dimple, and\nrosy tint rounded its contours and brightened its hues. I had been\naccustomed to nurse a flattering idea that my strong attachment to her\nproved some particular perspicacity in my nature; she was not handsome,\nshe was not rich, she was not even accomplished, yet was she my life's\ntreasure; I must then be a man of peculiar discernment. To-night my eyes\nopened on the mistake I had made; I began to suspect that it was only my\ntastes which were unique, not my power of discovering and appreciating\nthe superiority of moral worth over physical charms. For me Frances\nhad physical charms: in her there was no deformity to get over; none of\nthose prominent defects of eyes, teeth, complexion, shape, which hold at\nbay the admiration of the boldest male champions of intellect (for\nwomen can love a downright ugly man if he be but talented); had she been\neither \"edentee, myope, rugueuse, ou bossue,\" my feelings towards\nher might still have been kindly, but they could never have been\nimpassioned; I had affection for the poor little misshapen Sylvie, but\nfor her I could never have had love. It is true Frances' mental points\nhad been the first to interest me, and they still retained the strongest\nhold on my preference; but I liked the graces of her person too. I\nderived a pleasure, purely material, from contemplating the clearness\nof her brown eyes, the fairness of her fine skin, the purity of her\nwell-set teeth, the proportion of her delicate form; and that pleasure\nI could ill have dispensed with. It appeared, then, that I too was a\nsensualist, in my temperate and fastidious way.\n\nNow, reader, during the last two pages I have been giving you honey\nfresh from flowers, but you must not live entirely on food so luscious;\ntaste then a little gall--just a drop, by way of change.\n\nAt a somewhat late hour I returned to my lodgings: having temporarily\nforgotten that man had any such coarse cares as those of eating and\ndrinking, I went to bed fasting. I had been excited and in action all\nday, and had tasted no food since eight that morning; besides, for a\nfortnight past, I had known no rest either of body or mind; the last few\nhours had been a sweet delirium, it would not subside now, and till long\nafter midnight, broke with troubled ecstacy the rest I so much needed.\nAt last I dozed, but not for long; it was yet quite dark when I awoke,\nand my waking was like that of Job when a spirit passed before his face,\nand like him, \"the hair of my flesh stood up.\" I might continue the\nparallel, for in truth, though I saw nothing, yet \"a thing was secretly\nbrought unto me, and mine ear received a little thereof; there was\nsilence, and I heard a voice,\" saying--\"In the midst of life we are in\ndeath.\"\n\nThat sound, and the sensation of chill anguish accompanying it, many\nwould have regarded as supernatural; but I recognized it at once as the\neffect of reaction. Man is ever clogged with his mortality, and it was\nmy mortal nature which now faltered and plained; my nerves, which jarred\nand gave a false sound, because the soul, of late rushing headlong to an\naim, had overstrained the body's comparative weakness. A horror of great\ndarkness fell upon me; I felt my chamber invaded by one I had known\nformerly, but had thought for ever departed. I was temporarily a prey to\nhypochondria.\n\nShe had been my acquaintance, nay, my guest, once before in boyhood; I\nhad entertained her at bed and board for a year; for that space of time\nI had her to myself in secret; she lay with me, she ate with me, she\nwalked out with me, showing me nooks in woods, hollows in hills, where\nwe could sit together, and where she could drop her drear veil over me,\nand so hide sky and sun, grass and green tree; taking me entirely to her\ndeath-cold bosom, and holding me with arms of bone. What tales she would\ntell me at such hours! What songs she would recite in my ears! How she\nwould discourse to me of her own country--the grave--and again and again\npromise to conduct me there ere long; and, drawing me to the very brink\nof a black, sullen river, show me, on the other side, shores unequal\nwith mound, monument, and tablet, standing up in a glimmer more hoary\nthan moonlight. \"Necropolis!\" she would whisper, pointing to the pale\npiles, and add, \"It contains a mansion prepared for you.\"\n\nBut my boyhood was lonely, parentless; uncheered by brother or sister;\nand there was no marvel that, just as I rose to youth, a sorceress,\nfinding me lost in vague mental wanderings, with many affections and few\nobjects, glowing aspirations and gloomy prospects, strong desires and\nslender hopes, should lift up her illusive lamp to me in the distance,\nand lure me to her vaulted home of horrors. No wonder her spells\nTHEN had power; but NOW, when my course was widening, my prospect\nbrightening; when my affections had found a rest; when my desires,\nfolding wings, weary with long flight, had just alighted on the very lap\nof fruition, and nestled there warm, content, under the caress of a soft\nhand--why did hypochondria accost me now?\n\nI repulsed her as one would a dreaded and ghastly concubine coming to\nembitter a husband's heart toward his young bride; in vain; she kept her\nsway over me for that night and the next day, and eight succeeding days.\nAfterwards, my spirits began slowly to recover their tone; my appetite\nreturned, and in a fortnight I was well. I had gone about as usual all\nthe time, and had said nothing to anybody of what I felt; but I was glad\nwhen the evil spirit departed from me, and I could again seek Frances,\nand sit at her side, freed from the dreadful tyranny of my demon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nONE fine, frosty Sunday in November, Frances and I took a long walk; we\nmade the tour of the city by the Boulevards; and, afterwards, Frances\nbeing a little tired, we sat down on one of those wayside seats placed\nunder the trees, at intervals, for the accommodation of the weary.\nFrances was telling me about Switzerland; the subject animated her;\nand I was just thinking that her eyes spoke full as eloquently as her\ntongue, when she stopped and remarked--\n\n\"Monsieur, there is a gentleman who knows you.\"\n\nI looked up; three fashionably dressed men were just then\npassing--Englishmen, I knew by their air and gait as well as by their\nfeatures; in the tallest of the trio I at once recognized Mr. Hunsden;\nhe was in the act of lifting his hat to Frances; afterwards, he made a\ngrimace at me, and passed on.\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"A person I knew in England.\"\n\n\"Why did he bow to me? He does not know me.\"\n\n\"Yes, he does know you, in his way.\"\n\n\"How, monsieur?\" (She still called me \"monsieur\"; I could not persuade\nher to adopt any more familiar term.)\n\n\"Did you not read the expression of his eyes?\"\n\n\"Of his eyes? No. What did they say?\"\n\n\"To you they said, 'How do you do, Wilhelmina Crimsworth?' To me, 'So\nyou have found your counterpart at last; there she sits, the female of\nyour kind!'\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you could not read all that in his eyes; he was so soon\ngone.\"\n\n\"I read that and more, Frances; I read that he will probably call on me\nthis evening, or on some future occasion shortly; and I have no doubt\nhe will insist on being introduced to you; shall I bring him to your\nrooms?\"\n\n\"If you please, monsieur--I have no objection; I think, indeed, I should\nrather like to see him nearer; he looks so original.\"\n\nAs I had anticipated, Mr. Hunsden came that evening. The first thing he\nsaid was:--\n\n\"You need not begin boasting, Monsieur le Professeur; I know about your\nappointment to ---- College, and all that; Brown has told me.\" Then\nhe intimated that he had returned from Germany but a day or two since;\nafterwards, he abruptly demanded whether that was Madame Pelet-Reuter\nwith whom he had seen me on the Boulevards. I was going to utter a\nrather emphatic negative, but on second thoughts I checked myself, and,\nseeming to assent, asked what he thought of her?\n\n\"As to her, I'll come to that directly; but first I've a word for you. I\nsee you are a scoundrel; you've no business to be promenading about with\nanother man's wife. I thought you had sounder sense than to get mixed up\nin foreign hodge-podge of this sort.\"\n\n\"But the lady?\"\n\n\"She's too good for you evidently; she is like you, but something better\nthan you--no beauty, though; yet when she rose (for I looked back to\nsee you both walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good. These\nforeigners understand grace. What the devil has she done with Pelet? She\nhas not been married to him three months--he must be a spoon!\"\n\nI would not let the mistake go too far; I did not like it much.\n\n\"Pelet? How your head runs on Mons. and Madame Pelet! You are always\ntalking about them. I wish to the gods you had wed Mdlle. Zoraide\nyourself!\"\n\n\"Was that young gentlewoman not Mdlle. Zoraide?\"\n\n\"No; nor Madame Zoraide either.\"\n\n\"Why did you tell a lie, then?\"\n\n\"I told no lie; but you are is such a hurry. She is a pupil of mine--a\nSwiss girl.\"\n\n\"And of course you are going to be married to her? Don't deny that.\"\n\n\"Married! I think I shall--if Fate spares us both ten weeks longer. That\nis my little wild strawberry, Hunsden, whose sweetness made me careless\nof your hothouse grapes.\"\n\n\"Stop! No boasting--no heroics; I won't hear them. What is she? To what\ncaste does she belong?\"\n\nI smiled. Hunsden unconsciously laid stress on the word caste, and, in\nfact, republican, lord-hater as he was, Hunsden was as proud of his old\n----shire blood, of his descent and family standing, respectable and\nrespected through long generations back, as any peer in the realm of\nhis Norman race and Conquest-dated title. Hunsden would as little have\nthought of taking a wife from a caste inferior to his own, as a Stanley\nwould think of mating with a Cobden. I enjoyed the surprise I should\ngive; I enjoyed the triumph of my practice over his theory; and leaning\nover the table, and uttering the words slowly but with repressed glee, I\nsaid concisely--\n\n\"She is a lace-mender.\"\n\nHunsden examined me. He did not SAY he was surprised, but surprised he\nwas; he had his own notions of good breeding. I saw he suspected I\nwas going to take some very rash step; but repressing declamation or\nremonstrance, he only answered--\n\n\"Well, you are the best judge of your own affairs. A lace-mender may\nmake a good wife as well as a lady; but of course you have taken care\nto ascertain thoroughly that since she has not education, fortune or\nstation, she is well furnished with such natural qualities as you think\nmost likely to conduce to your happiness. Has she many relations?\"\n\n\"None in Brussels.\"\n\n\"That is better. Relations are often the real evil in such cases. I\ncannot but think that a train of inferior connections would have been a\nbore to you to your life's end.\"\n\nAfter sitting in silence a little while longer, Hunsden rose, and was\nquietly bidding me good evening; the polite, considerate manner in which\nhe offered me his hand (a thing he had never done before), convinced me\nthat he thought I had made a terrible fool of myself; and that, ruined\nand thrown away as I was, it was no time for sarcasm or cynicism, or\nindeed for anything but indulgence and forbearance.\n\n\"Good night, William,\" he said, in a really soft voice, while his face\nlooked benevolently compassionate. \"Good night, lad. I wish you and your\nfuture wife much prosperity; and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious\nsoul.\"\n\nI had much ado to refrain from laughing as I beheld the magnanimous pity\nof his mien; maintaining, however, a grave air, I said:--\n\n\"I thought you would have liked to have seen Mdlle. Henri?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is the name! Yes--if it would be convenient, I should like to\nsee her--but----.\" He hesitated.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I should on no account wish to intrude.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" said I. We set out. Hunsden no doubt regarded me as a\nrash, imprudent man, thus to show my poor little grisette sweetheart,\nin her poor little unfurnished grenier; but he prepared to act the real\ngentleman, having, in fact, the kernel of that character, under the\nharsh husk it pleased him to wear by way of mental mackintosh. He talked\naffably, and even gently, as we went along the street; he had never been\nso civil to me in his life. We reached the house, entered, ascended the\nstair; on gaining the lobby, Hunsden turned to mount a narrower stair\nwhich led to a higher story; I saw his mind was bent on the attics.\n\n\"Here, Mr. Hunsden,\" said I quietly, tapping at Frances' door. He\nturned; in his genuine politeness he was a little disconcerted at\nhaving made the mistake; his eye reverted to the green mat, but he said\nnothing.\n\nWe walked in, and Frances rose from her seat near the table to receive\nus; her mourning attire gave her a recluse, rather conventual, but\nwithal very distinguished look; its grave simplicity added nothing\nto beauty, but much to dignity; the finish of the white collar and\nmanchettes sufficed for a relief to the merino gown of solemn black;\nornament was forsworn. Frances curtsied with sedate grace, looking, as\nshe always did, when one first accosted her, more a woman to respect\nthan to love; I introduced Mr. Hunsden, and she expressed her happiness\nat making his acquaintance in French. The pure and polished accent, the\nlow yet sweet and rather full voice, produced their effect immediately;\nHunsden spoke French in reply; I had not heard him speak that language\nbefore; he managed it very well. I retired to the window-seat; Mr.\nHunsden, at his hostess's invitation, occupied a chair near the hearth;\nfrom my position I could see them both, and the room too, at a glance.\nThe room was so clean and bright, it looked like a little polished\ncabinet; a glass filled with flowers in the centre of the table, a\nfresh rose in each china cup on the mantelpiece gave it an air of FETE.\nFrances was serious, and Mr. Hunsden subdued, but both mutually polite;\nthey got on at the French swimmingly: ordinary topics were discussed\nwith great state and decorum; I thought I had never seen two such models\nof propriety, for Hunsden (thanks to the constraint of the foreign\ntongue) was obliged to shape his phrases, and measure his sentences,\nwith a care that forbade any eccentricity. At last England was\nmentioned, and Frances proceeded to ask questions. Animated by degrees,\nshe began to change, just as a grave night-sky changes at the approach\nof sunrise: first it seemed as if her forehead cleared, then her eyes\nglittered, her features relaxed, and became quite mobile; her subdued\ncomplexion grew warm and transparent; to me, she now looked pretty;\nbefore, she had only looked ladylike.\n\nShe had many things to say to the Englishman just fresh from his\nisland-country, and she urged him with an enthusiasm of curiosity, which\nere long thawed Hunsden's reserve as fire thaws a congealed viper. I use\nthis not very flattering comparison because he vividly reminded me of a\nsnake waking from torpor, as he erected his tall form, reared his head,\nbefore a little declined, and putting back his hair from his broad Saxon\nforehead, showed unshaded the gleam of almost savage satire which his\ninterlocutor's tone of eagerness and look of ardour had sufficed at\nonce to kindle in his soul and elicit from his eyes: he was himself;\nas Frances was herself, and in none but his own language would he now\naddress her.\n\n\"You understand English?\" was the prefatory question.\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you shall have plenty of it; and first, I see you've not\nmuch more sense than some others of my acquaintance\" (indicating me\nwith his thumb), \"or else you'd never turn rabid about that dirty little\ncountry called England; for rabid, I see you are; I read Anglophobia in\nyour looks, and hear it in your words. Why, mademoiselle, is it possible\nthat anybody with a grain of rationality should feel enthusiasm about a\nmere name, and that name England? I thought you were a lady-abbess five\nminutes ago, and respected you accordingly; and now I see you are a sort\nof Swiss sibyl, with high Tory and high Church principles!\"\n\n\"England is your country?\" asked Frances.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you don't like it?\"\n\n\"I'd be sorry to like it! A little corrupt, venal, lord-and-king-cursed\nnation, full of mucky pride (as they say in ----shire), and helpless\npauperism; rotten with abuses, worm-eaten with prejudices!\"\n\n\"You might say so of almost every state; there are abuses and prejudices\neverywhere, and I thought fewer in England than in other countries.\"\n\n\"Come to England and see. Come to Birmingham and Manchester; come to St.\nGiles' in London, and get a practical notion of how our system works.\nExamine the footprints of our august aristocracy; see how they walk\nin blood, crushing hearts as they go. Just put your head in at English\ncottage doors; get a glimpse of Famine crouched torpid on black\nhearthstones; of Disease lying bare on beds without coverlets, of\nInfamy wantoning viciously with Ignorance, though indeed Luxury is her\nfavourite paramour, and princely halls are dearer to her than thatched\nhovels----\"\n\n\"I was not thinking of the wretchedness and vice in England; I was\nthinking of the good side--of what is elevated in your character as a\nnation.\"\n\n\"There is no good side--none at least of which you can have any\nknowledge; for you cannot appreciate the efforts of industry, the\nachievements of enterprise, or the discoveries of science: narrowness\nof education and obscurity of position quite incapacitate you\nfrom understanding these points; and as to historical and poetical\nassociations, I will not insult you, mademoiselle, by supposing that you\nalluded to such humbug.\"\n\n\"But I did partly.\"\n\nHunsden laughed--his laugh of unmitigated scorn.\n\n\"I did, Mr. Hunsden. Are you of the number of those to whom such\nassociations give no pleasure?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, what is an association? I never saw one. What is its\nlength, breadth, weight, value--ay, VALUE? What price will it bring in\nthe market?\"\n\n\"Your portrait, to any one who loved you, would, for the sake of\nassociation, be without price.\"\n\nThat inscrutable Hunsden heard this remark and felt it rather acutely,\ntoo, somewhere; for he coloured--a thing not unusual with him, when hit\nunawares on a tender point. A sort of trouble momentarily darkened\nhis eye, and I believe he filled up the transient pause succeeding his\nantagonist's home-thrust, by a wish that some one did love him as\nhe would like to be loved--some one whose love he could unreservedly\nreturn.\n\nThe lady pursued her temporary advantage.\n\n\"If your world is a world without associations, Mr. Hunsden, I no longer\nwonder that you hate England so. I don't clearly know what Paradise is,\nand what angels are; yet taking it to be the most glorious region I can\nconceive, and angels the most elevated existences--if one of them--if\nAbdiel the Faithful himself\" (she was thinking of Milton) \"were suddenly\nstripped of the faculty of association, I think he would soon rush forth\nfrom 'the ever-during gates,' leave heaven, and seek what he had lost in\nhell. Yes, in the very hell from which he turned 'with retorted scorn.'\"\n\nFrances' tone in saying this was as marked as her language, and it\nwas when the word \"hell\" twanged off from her lips, with a somewhat\nstartling emphasis, that Hunsden deigned to bestow one slight glance of\nadmiration. He liked something strong, whether in man or woman; he liked\nwhatever dared to clear conventional limits. He had never before heard\na lady say \"hell\" with that uncompromising sort of accent, and the sound\npleased him from a lady's lips; he would fain have had Frances to strike\nthe string again, but it was not in her way. The display of eccentric\nvigour never gave her pleasure, and it only sounded in her voice or\nflashed in her countenance when extraordinary circumstances--and those\ngenerally painful--forced it out of the depths where it burned latent.\nTo me, once or twice, she had in intimate conversation, uttered\nventurous thoughts in nervous language; but when the hour of such\nmanifestation was past, I could not recall it; it came of itself and of\nitself departed. Hunsden's excitations she put by soon with a smile, and\nrecurring to the theme of disputation, said--\n\n\"Since England is nothing, why do the continental nations respect her\nso?\"\n\n\"I should have thought no child would have asked that question,\" replied\nHunsden, who never at any time gave information without reproving for\nstupidity those who asked it of him. \"If you had been my pupil, as I\nsuppose you once had the misfortune to be that of a deplorable character\nnot a hundred miles off, I would have put you in the corner for such a\nconfession of ignorance. Why, mademoiselle, can't you see that it is\nour GOLD which buys us French politeness, German good-will, and Swiss\nservility?\" And he sneered diabolically.\n\n\"Swiss?\" said Frances, catching the word \"servility.\" \"Do you call my\ncountrymen servile?\" and she started up. I could not suppress a low\nlaugh; there was ire in her glance and defiance in her attitude. \"Do\nyou abuse Switzerland to me, Mr. Hunsden? Do you think I have no\nassociations? Do you calculate that I am prepared to dwell only on what\nvice and degradation may be found in Alpine villages, and to leave\nquite out of my heart the social greatness of my countrymen, and our\nblood-earned freedom, and the natural glories of our mountains? You're\nmistaken--you're mistaken.\"\n\n\"Social greatness? Call it what you will, your countrymen are sensible\nfellows; they make a marketable article of what to you is an abstract\nidea; they have, ere this, sold their social greatness and also their\nblood-earned freedom to be the servants of foreign kings.\"\n\n\"You never were in Switzerland?\"\n\n\"Yes--I have been there twice.\"\n\n\"You know nothing of it.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And you say the Swiss are mercenary, as a parrot says 'Poor Poll,' or\nas the Belgians here say the English are not brave, or as the French\naccuse them of being perfidious: there is no justice in your dictums.\"\n\n\"There is truth.\"\n\n\"I tell you, Mr. Hunsden, you are a more unpractical man than I am an\nunpractical woman, for you don't acknowledge what really exists; you\nwant to annihilate individual patriotism and national greatness as\nan atheist would annihilate God and his own soul, by denying their\nexistence.\"\n\n\"Where are you flying to? You are off at a tangent--I thought we were\ntalking about the mercenary nature of the Swiss.\"\n\n\"We were--and if you proved to me that the Swiss are mercenary to-morrow\n(which you cannot do) I should love Switzerland still.\"\n\n\"You would be mad, then--mad as a March hare--to indulge in a passion\nfor millions of shiploads of soil, timber, snow, and ice.\"\n\n\"Not so mad as you who love nothing.\"\n\n\"There's a method in my madness; there's none in yours.\"\n\n\"Your method is to squeeze the sap out of creation and make manure of\nthe refuse, by way of turning it to what you call use.\"\n\n\"You cannot reason at all,\" said Hunsden; \"there is no logic in you.\"\n\n\"Better to be without logic than without feeling,\" retorted Frances, who\nwas now passing backwards and forwards from her cupboard to the table,\nintent, if not on hospitable thoughts, at least on hospitable deeds, for\nshe was laying the cloth, and putting plates, knives and forks thereon.\n\n\"Is that a hit at me, mademoiselle? Do you suppose I am without\nfeeling?\"\n\n\"I suppose you are always interfering with your own feelings, and those\nof other people, and dogmatizing about the irrationality of this, that,\nand the other sentiment, and then ordering it to be suppressed because\nyou imagine it to be inconsistent with logic.\"\n\n\"I do right.\"\n\nFrances had stepped out of sight into a sort of little pantry; she soon\nreappeared.\n\n\"You do right? Indeed, no! You are much mistaken if you think so. Just\nbe so good as to let me get to the fire, Mr. Hunsden; I have something\nto cook.\" (An interval occupied in settling a casserole on the fire;\nthen, while she stirred its contents:) \"Right! as if it were right to\ncrush any pleasurable sentiment that God has given to man, especially\nany sentiment that, like patriotism, spreads man's selfishness in wider\ncircles\" (fire stirred, dish put down before it).\n\n\"Were you born in Switzerland?\"\n\n\"I should think so, or else why should I call it my country?\"\n\n\"And where did you get your English features and figure?\"\n\n\"I am English, too; half the blood in my veins is English; thus I have\na right to a double power of patriotism, possessing an interest in two\nnoble, free, and fortunate countries.\"\n\n\"You had an English mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; and you, I suppose, had a mother from the moon or from\nUtopia, since not a nation in Europe has a claim on your interest?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I'm a universal patriot, if you could understand me\nrightly: my country is the world.\"\n\n\"Sympathies so widely diffused must be very shallow: will you have\nthe goodness to come to table. Monsieur\" (to me who appeared to be now\nabsorbed in reading by moonlight)--\"Monsieur, supper is served.\"\n\nThis was said in quite a different voice to that in which she had been\nbandying phrases with Mr. Hunsden--not so short, graver and softer.\n\n\"Frances, what do you mean by preparing, supper? we had no intention of\nstaying.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur, but you have stayed, and supper is prepared; you have\nonly the alternative of eating it.\"\n\nThe meal was a foreign one, of course; it consisted in two small but\ntasty dishes of meat prepared with skill and served with nicety; a salad\nand \"fromage francais,\" completed it. The business of eating interposed\na brief truce between the belligerents, but no sooner was supper\ndisposed of than they were at it again. The fresh subject of dispute\nran on the spirit of religious intolerance which Mr. Hunsden affirmed to\nexist strongly in Switzerland, notwithstanding the professed attachment\nof the Swiss to freedom. Here Frances had greatly the worst of it,\nnot only because she was unskilled to argue, but because her own real\nopinions on the point in question happened to coincide pretty nearly\nwith Mr. Hunsden's, and she only contradicted him out of opposition. At\nlast she gave in, confessing that she thought as he thought, but bidding\nhim take notice that she did not consider herself beaten.\n\n\"No more did the French at Waterloo,\" said Hunsden.\n\n\"There is no comparison between the cases,\" rejoined Frances; \"mine was\na sham fight.\"\n\n\"Sham or real, it's up with you.\"\n\n\"No; though I have neither logic nor wealth of words, yet in a case\nwhere my opinion really differed from yours, I would adhere to it when\nI had not another word to say in its defence; you should be baffled by\ndumb determination. You speak of Waterloo; your Wellington ought to have\nbeen conquered there, according to Napoleon; but he persevered in spite\nof the laws of war, and was victorious in defiance of military tactics.\nI would do as he did.\"\n\n\"I'll be bound for it you would; probably you have some of the same sort\nof stubborn stuff in you.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry if I had not; he and Tell were brothers, and I'd\nscorn the Swiss, man or woman, who had none of the much-enduring nature\nof our heroic William in his soul.\"\n\n\"If Tell was like Wellington, he was an ass.\"\n\n\"Does not ASS mean BAUDET?\" asked Frances, turning to me.\n\n\"No, no,\" replied I, \"it means an ESPRIT-FORT; and now,\" I continued, as\nI saw that fresh occasion of strife was brewing between these two, \"it\nis high time to go.\"\n\nHunsden rose. \"Good bye,\" said he to Frances; \"I shall be off for this\nglorious England to-morrow, and it may be twelve months or more before\nI come to Brussels again; whenever I do come I'll seek you out, and\nyou shall see if I don't find means to make you fiercer than a dragon.\nYou've done pretty well this evening, but next interview you shall\nchallenge me outright. Meantime you're doomed to become Mrs. William\nCrimsworth, I suppose; poor young lady? but you have a spark of spirit;\ncherish it, and give the Professor the full benefit thereof.\"\n\n\"Are you married. Mr. Hunsden?\" asked Frances, suddenly.\n\n\"No. I should have thought you might have guessed I was a Benedict by my\nlook.\"\n\n\"Well, whenever you marry don't take a wife out of Switzerland; for if\nyou begin blaspheming Helvetia, and cursing the cantons--above all, if\nyou mention the word ASS in the same breath with the name Tell (for\nass IS baudet, I know; though Monsieur is pleased to translate\nit ESPRIT-FORT) your mountain maid will some night smother her\nBreton-bretonnant, even as your own Shakspeare's Othello smothered\nDesdemona.\"\n\n\"I am warned,\" said Hunsden; \"and so are you, lad,\" (nodding to me). \"I\nhope yet to hear of a travesty of the Moor and his gentle lady, in which\nthe parts shall be reversed according to the plan just sketched--you,\nhowever, being in my nightcap. Farewell, mademoiselle!\" He bowed on her\nhand, absolutely like Sir Charles Grandison on that of Harriet Byron;\nadding--\"Death from such fingers would not be without charms.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu!\" murmured Frances, opening her large eyes and lifting her\ndistinctly arched brows; \"c'est qu'il fait des compliments! je ne m'y\nsuis pas attendu.\" She smiled, half in ire, half in mirth, curtsied with\nforeign grace, and so they parted.\n\nNo sooner had we got into the street than Hunsden collared me.\n\n\"And that is your lace-mender?\" said he; \"and you reckon you have done\na fine, magnanimous thing in offering to marry her? You, a scion of\nSeacombe, have proved your disdain of social distinctions by taking up\nwith an ouvriere! And I pitied the fellow, thinking his feelings had\nmisled him, and that he had hurt himself by contracting a low match!\"\n\n\"Just let go my collar, Hunsden.\"\n\nOn the contrary, he swayed me to and fro; so I grappled him round the\nwaist. It was dark; the street lonely and lampless. We had then a\ntug for it; and after we had both rolled on the pavement, and with\ndifficulty picked ourselves up, we agreed to walk on more soberly.\n\n\"Yes, that's my lace-mender,\" said I; \"and she is to be mine for\nlife--God willing.\"\n\n\"God is not willing--you can't suppose it; what business have you to\nbe suited so well with a partner? And she treats you with a sort of\nrespect, too, and says, 'Monsieur' and modulates her tone in addressing\nyou, actually, as if you were something superior! She could not evince\nmore deference to such a one as I, were she favoured by fortune to the\nsupreme extent of being my choice instead of yours.\"\n\n\"Hunsden, you're a puppy. But you've only seen the title-page of my\nhappiness; you don't know the tale that follows; you cannot conceive the\ninterest and sweet variety and thrilling excitement of the narrative.\"\n\nHunsden--speaking low and deep, for we had now entered a busier\nstreet--desired me to hold my peace, threatening to do something\ndreadful if I stimulated his wrath further by boasting. I laughed till\nmy sides ached. We soon reached his hotel; before he entered it, he\nsaid--\n\n\"Don't be vainglorious. Your lace-mender is too good for you, but not\ngood enough for me; neither physically nor morally does she come up\nto my ideal of a woman. No; I dream of something far beyond that\npale-faced, excitable little Helvetian (by-the-by she has infinitely\nmore of the nervous, mobile Parisienne in her than of the the robust\n'jungfrau'). Your Mdlle. Henri is in person \"chetive\", in mind \"sans\ncaractere\", compared with the queen of my visions. You, indeed, may put\nup with that \"minois chiffone\"; but when I marry I must have straighter\nand more harmonious features, to say nothing of a nobler and better\ndeveloped shape than that perverse, ill-thriven child can boast.\"\n\n\"Bribe a seraph to fetch you a coal of fire from heaven, if you will,\"\nsaid I, \"and with it kindle life in the tallest, fattest, most boneless,\nfullest-blooded of Ruben's painted women--leave me only my Alpine peri,\nand I'll not envy you.\"\n\nWith a simultaneous movement, each turned his back on the other. Neither\nsaid \"God bless you;\" yet on the morrow the sea was to roll between us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nIN two months more Frances had fulfilled the time of mourning for her\naunt. One January morning--the first of the new year holidays--I went in\na fiacre, accompanied only by M. Vandenhuten, to the Rue Notre Dame aux\nNeiges, and having alighted alone and walked upstairs, I found Frances\napparently waiting for me, dressed in a style scarcely appropriate to\nthat cold, bright, frosty day. Never till now had I seen her attired in\nany other than black or sad-coloured stuff; and there she stood by the\nwindow, clad all in white, and white of a most diaphanous texture; her\narray was very simple, to be sure, but it looked imposing and festal\nbecause it was so clear, full, and floating; a veil shadowed her head,\nand hung below her knee; a little wreath of pink flowers fastened it\nto her thickly tressed Grecian plait, and thence it fell softly on each\nside of her face. Singular to state, she was, or had been crying; when\nI asked her if she were ready, she said \"Yes, monsieur,\" with something\nvery like a checked sob; and when I took a shawl, which lay on the\ntable, and folded it round her, not only did tear after tear course\nunbidden down her cheek, but she shook to my ministration like a reed.\nI said I was sorry to see her in such low spirits, and requested to\nbe allowed an insight into the origin thereof. She only said, \"It was\nimpossible to help it,\" and then voluntarily, though hurriedly, putting\nher hand into mine, accompanied me out of the room, and ran downstairs\nwith a quick, uncertain step, like one who was eager to get some\nformidable piece of business over. I put her into the fiacre. M.\nVandenhuten received her, and seated her beside himself; we drove all\ntogether to the Protestant chapel, went through a certain service in the\nCommon Prayer Book, and she and I came out married. M. Vandenhuten had\ngiven the bride away.\n\nWe took no bridal trip; our modesty, screened by the peaceful obscurity\nof our station, and the pleasant isolation of our circumstances, did not\nexact that additional precaution. We repaired at once to a small house\nI had taken in the faubourg nearest to that part of the city where the\nscene of our avocations lay.\n\nThree or four hours after the wedding ceremony, Frances, divested of her\nbridal snow, and attired in a pretty lilac gown of warmer materials,\na piquant black silk apron, and a lace collar with some finishing\ndecoration of lilac ribbon, was kneeling on the carpet of a neatly\nfurnished though not spacious parlour, arranging on the shelves of a\nchiffoniere some books, which I handed to her from the table. It was\nsnowing fast out of doors; the afternoon had turned out wild and\ncold; the leaden sky seemed full of drifts, and the street was already\nankle-deep in the white downfall. Our fire burned bright, our new\nhabitation looked brilliantly clean and fresh, the furniture was all\narranged, and there were but some articles of glass, china, books,\n&c., to put in order. Frances found in this business occupation till\ntea-time, and then, after I had distinctly instructed her how to make\na cup of tea in rational English style, and after she had got over the\ndismay occasioned by seeing such an extravagant amount of material put\ninto the pot, she administered to me a proper British repast, at which\nthere wanted neither candles nor urn, firelight nor comfort.\n\nOur week's holiday glided by, and we readdressed ourselves to labour.\nBoth my wife and I began in good earnest with the notion that we were\nworking people, destined to earn our bread by exertion, and that of the\nmost assiduous kind. Our days were thoroughly occupied; we used to part\nevery morning at eight o'clock, and not meet again till five P.M.; but\ninto what sweet rest did the turmoil of each busy day decline! Looking\ndown the vista of memory, I see the evenings passed in that little\nparlour like a long string of rubies circling the dusky brow of the past.\nUnvaried were they as each cut gem, and like each gem brilliant and\nburning.\n\nA year and a half passed. One morning (it was a FETE, and we had the day\nto ourselves) Frances said to me, with a suddenness peculiar to her when\nshe had been thinking long on a subject, and at last, having come to\na conclusion, wished to test its soundness by the touchstone of my\njudgment:--\n\n\"I don't work enough.\"\n\n\"What now?\" demanded I, looking up from my coffee, which I had been\ndeliberately stirring while enjoying, in anticipation, a walk I proposed\nto take with Frances, that fine summer day (it was June), to a certain\nfarmhouse in the country, where we were to dine. \"What now?\" and I\nsaw at once, in the serious ardour of her face, a project of vital\nimportance.\n\n\"I am not satisfied,\" returned she: \"you are now earning eight thousand\nfrancs a year\" (it was true; my efforts, punctuality, the fame of my\npupils' progress, the publicity of my station, had so far helped me\non), \"while I am still at my miserable twelve hundred francs. I CAN do\nbetter, and I WILL.\"\n\n\"You work as long and as diligently as I do, Frances.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, but I am not working in the right way, and I am\nconvinced of it.\"\n\n\"You wish to change--you have a plan for progress in your mind; go and\nput on your bonnet; and, while we take our walk, you shall tell me of\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\nShe went--as docile as a well-trained child; she was a curious mixture\nof tractability and firmness: I sat thinking about her, and wondering\nwhat her plan could be, when she re-entered.\n\n\"Monsieur, I have given Minnie\" (our bonne) \"leave to go out too, as it\nis so very fine; so will you be kind enough to lock the door, and take\nthe key with you?\"\n\n\"Kiss me, Mrs. Crimsworth,\" was my not very apposite reply; but she\nlooked so engaging in her light summer dress and little cottage bonnet,\nand her manner in speaking to me was then, as always, so unaffectedly\nand suavely respectful, that my heart expanded at the sight of her, and\na kiss seemed necessary to content its importunity.\n\n\"There, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why do you always call me 'Monsieur'? Say, 'William.'\"\n\n\"I cannot pronounce your W; besides, 'Monsieur' belongs to you; I like\nit best.\"\n\nMinnie having departed in clean cap and smart shawl, we, too, set out,\nleaving the house solitary and silent--silent, at least, but for\nthe ticking of the clock. We were soon clear of Brussels; the fields\nreceived us, and then the lanes, remote from carriage-resounding\nCHAUSSEES. Ere long we came upon a nook, so rural, green, and secluded,\nit might have been a spot in some pastoral English province; a bank of\nshort and mossy grass, under a hawthorn, offered a seat too tempting\nto be declined; we took it, and when we had admired and examined some\nEnglish-looking wild-flowers growing at our feet, I recalled Frances'\nattention and my own to the topic touched on at breakfast.\n\n\"What was her plan?\" A natural one--the next step to be mounted by\nus, or, at least, by her, if she wanted to rise in her profession. She\nproposed to begin a school. We already had the means for commencing on\na careful scale, having lived greatly within our income. We possessed,\ntoo, by this time, an extensive and eligible connection, in the sense\nadvantageous to our business; for, though our circle of visiting\nacquaintance continued as limited as ever, we were now widely known in\nschools and families as teachers. When Frances had developed her plan,\nshe intimated, in some closing sentences, her hopes for the future. If\nwe only had good health and tolerable success, me might, she was sure,\nin time realize an independency; and that, perhaps, before we were too\nold to enjoy it; then both she and I would rest; and what was to hinder\nus from going to live in England? England was still her Promised Land.\n\nI put no obstacle in her way; raised no objection; I knew she was\nnot one who could live quiescent and inactive, or even comparatively\ninactive. Duties she must have to fulfil, and important duties; work to\ndo--and exciting, absorbing, profitable work; strong faculties stirred\nin her frame, and they demanded full nourishment, free exercise: mine\nwas not the hand ever to starve or cramp them; no, I delighted in\noffering them sustenance, and in clearing them wider space for action.\n\n\"You have conceived a plan, Frances,\" said I, \"and a good plan; execute\nit; you have my free consent, and wherever and whenever my assistance is\nwanted, ask and you shall have.\"\n\nFrances' eyes thanked me almost with tears; just a sparkle or two, soon\nbrushed away; she possessed herself of my hand too, and held it for\nsome time very close clasped in both her own, but she said no more than\n\"Thank you, monsieur.\"\n\nWe passed a divine day, and came home late, lighted by a full summer\nmoon.\n\nTen years rushed now upon me with dusty, vibrating, unresting wings;\nyears of bustle, action, unslacked endeavour; years in which I and\nmy wife, having launched ourselves in the full career of progress, as\nprogress whirls on in European capitals, scarcely knew repose, were\nstrangers to amusement, never thought of indulgence, and yet, as\nour course ran side by side, as we marched hand in hand, we neither\nmurmured, repented, nor faltered. Hope indeed cheered us; health kept us\nup; harmony of thought and deed smoothed many difficulties, and finally,\nsuccess bestowed every now and then encouraging reward on diligence. Our\nschool became one of the most popular in Brussels, and as by degrees\nwe raised our terms and elevated our system of education, our choice of\npupils grew more select, and at length included the children of the\nbest families in Belgium. We had too an excellent connection in England,\nfirst opened by the unsolicited recommendation of Mr. Hunsden, who\nhaving been over, and having abused me for my prosperity in set terms,\nwent back, and soon after sent a leash of young ----shire heiresses--his\ncousins; as he said \"to be polished off by Mrs. Crimsworth.\"\n\nAs to this same Mrs. Crimsworth, in one sense she was become another\nwoman, though in another she remained unchanged. So different was\nshe under different circumstances. I seemed to possess two wives. The\nfaculties of her nature, already disclosed when I married her, remained\nfresh and fair; but other faculties shot up strong, branched out\nbroad, and quite altered the external character of the plant. Firmness,\nactivity, and enterprise, covered with grave foliage, poetic feeling\nand fervour; but these flowers were still there, preserved pure and dewy\nunder the umbrage of later growth and hardier nature: perhaps I only in\nthe world knew the secret of their existence, but to me they were ever\nready to yield an exquisite fragrance and present a beauty as chaste as\nradiant.\n\nIn the daytime my house and establishment were conducted by Madame the\ndirectress, a stately and elegant woman, bearing much anxious thought on\nher large brow; much calculated dignity in her serious mien: immediately\nafter breakfast I used to part with this lady; I went to my college,\nshe to her schoolroom; returning for an hour in the course of the day,\nI found her always in class, intently occupied; silence, industry,\nobservance, attending on her presence. When not actually teaching,\nshe was overlooking and guiding by eye and gesture; she then appeared\nvigilant and solicitous. When communicating instruction, her aspect was\nmore animated; she seemed to feel a certain enjoyment in the occupation.\nThe language in which she addressed her pupils, though simple and\nunpretending, was never trite or dry; she did not speak from routine\nformulas--she made her own phrases as she went on, and very nervous\nand impressive phrases they frequently were; often, when elucidating\nfavourite points of history, or geography, she would wax genuinely\neloquent in her earnestness. Her pupils, or at least the elder and more\nintelligent amongst them, recognized well the language of a superior\nmind; they felt too, and some of them received the impression of\nelevated sentiments; there was little fondling between mistress and\ngirls, but some of Frances' pupils in time learnt to love her sincerely,\nall of them beheld her with respect; her general demeanour towards\nthem was serious; sometimes benignant when they pleased her with their\nprogress and attention, always scrupulously refined and considerate.\nIn cases where reproof or punishment was called for she was usually\nforbearing enough; but if any took advantage of that forbearance, which\nsometimes happened, a sharp, sudden and lightning-like severity taught\nthe culprit the extent of the mistake committed. Sometimes a gleam of\ntenderness softened her eyes and manner, but this was rare; only when\na pupil was sick, or when it pined after home, or in the case of some\nlittle motherless child, or of one much poorer than its companions,\nwhose scanty wardrobe and mean appointments brought on it the contempt\nof the jewelled young countesses and silk-clad misses. Over such feeble\nfledglings the directress spread a wing of kindliest protection: it was\nto their bedside she came at night to tuck them warmly in; it was after\nthem she looked in winter to see that they always had a comfortable seat\nby the stove; it was they who by turns were summoned to the salon to\nreceive some little dole of cake or fruit--to sit on a footstool at\nthe fireside--to enjoy home comforts, and almost home liberty, for\nan evening together--to be spoken to gently and softly, comforted,\nencouraged, cherished--and when bedtime came, dismissed with a kiss\nof true tenderness. As to Julia and Georgiana G----, daughters of an\nEnglish baronet, as to Mdlle. Mathilde de ----, heiress of a Belgian\ncount, and sundry other children of patrician race, the directress was\ncareful of them as of the others, anxious for their progress, as for\nthat of the rest--but it never seemed to enter her head to distinguish\nthem by a mark of preference; one girl of noble blood she loved\ndearly--a young Irish baroness--lady Catherine ----; but it was for her\nenthusiastic heart and clever head, for her generosity and her genius,\nthe title and rank went for nothing.\n\nMy afternoons were spent also in college, with the exception of an hour\nthat my wife daily exacted of me for her establishment, and with which\nshe would not dispense. She said that I must spend that time amongst her\npupils to learn their characters, to be AU COURANT with everything that\nwas passing in the house, to become interested in what interested her,\nto be able to give her my opinion on knotty points when she required it,\nand this she did constantly, never allowing my interest in the pupils\nto fall asleep, and never making any change of importance without\nmy cognizance and consent. She delighted to sit by me when I gave my\nlessons (lessons in literature), her hands folded on her knee, the most\nfixedly attentive of any present. She rarely addressed me in class; when\nshe did it was with an air of marked deference; it was her pleasure, her\njoy to make me still the master in all things.\n\nAt six o'clock P.M. my daily labours ceased. I then came home, for\nmy home was my heaven; ever at that hour, as I entered our private\nsitting-room, the lady-directress vanished from before my eyes, and\nFrances Henri, my own little lace-mender, was magically restored to my\narms; much disappointed she would have been if her master had not been\nas constant to the tryst as herself, and if his truthfull kiss had not\nbeen prompt to answer her soft, \"Bon soir, monsieur.\"\n\nTalk French to me she would, and many a punishment she has had for\nher wilfulness. I fear the choice of chastisement must have been\ninjudicious, for instead of correcting the fault, it seemed to encourage\nits renewal. Our evenings were our own; that recreation was necessary to\nrefresh our strength for the due discharge of our duties; sometimes we\nspent them all in conversation, and my young Genevese, now that she was\nthoroughly accustomed to her English professor, now that she loved\nhim too absolutely to fear him much, reposed in him a confidence so\nunlimited that topics of conversation could no more be wanting with him\nthan subjects for communion with her own heart. In those moments, happy\nas a bird with its mate, she would show me what she had of vivacity, of\nmirth, of originality in her well-dowered nature. She would show, too,\nsome stores of raillery, of \"malice,\" and would vex, tease, pique me\nsometimes about what she called my \"bizarreries anglaises,\" my \"caprices\ninsulaires,\" with a wild and witty wickedness that made a perfect white\ndemon of her while it lasted. This was rare, however, and the elfish\nfreak was always short: sometimes when driven a little hard in the war\nof words--for her tongue did ample justice to the pith, the point, the\ndelicacy of her native French, in which language she always attacked\nme--I used to turn upon her with my old decision, and arrest bodily the\nsprite that teased me. Vain idea! no sooner had I grasped hand or arm\nthan the elf was gone; the provocative smile quenched in the expressive\nbrown eyes, and a ray of gentle homage shone under the lids in its\nplace. I had seized a mere vexing fairy, and found a submissive and\nsupplicating little mortal woman in my arms. Then I made her get a book,\nand read English to me for an hour by way of penance. I frequently dosed\nher with Wordsworth in this way, and Wordsworth steadied her soon; she\nhad a difficulty in comprehending his deep, serene, and sober mind; his\nlanguage, too, was not facile to her; she had to ask questions, to sue\nfor explanations, to be like a child and a novice, and to acknowledge\nme as her senior and director. Her instinct instantly penetrated and\npossessed the meaning of more ardent and imaginative writers. Byron\nexcited her; Scott she loved; Wordsworth only she puzzled at, wondered\nover, and hesitated to pronounce an opinion upon.\n\nBut whether she read to me, or talked with me; whether she teased me\nin French, or entreated me in English; whether she jested with wit,\nor inquired with deference; narrated with interest, or listened with\nattention; whether she smiled at me or on me, always at nine o'clock I\nwas left abandoned. She would extricate herself from my arms, quit\nmy side, take her lamp, and be gone. Her mission was upstairs; I have\nfollowed her sometimes and watched her. First she opened the door of the\ndortoir (the pupils' chamber), noiselessly she glided up the long room\nbetween the two rows of white beds, surveyed all the sleepers; if any\nwere wakeful, especially if any were sad, spoke to them and soothed\nthem; stood some minutes to ascertain that all was safe and tranquil;\ntrimmed the watch-light which burned in the apartment all night, then\nwithdrew, closing the door behind her without sound. Thence she glided\nto our own chamber; it had a little cabinet within; this she sought;\nthere, too, appeared a bed, but one, and that a very small one; her face\n(the night I followed and observed her) changed as she approached this\ntiny couch; from grave it warmed to earnest; she shaded with one hand\nthe lamp she held in the other; she bent above the pillow and hung\nover a child asleep; its slumber (that evening at least, and usually,\nI believe) was sound and calm; no tear wet its dark eyelashes; no fever\nheated its round cheek; no ill dream discomposed its budding features.\nFrances gazed, she did not smile, and yet the deepest delight filled,\nflushed her face; feeling pleasurable, powerful, worked in her whole\nframe, which still was motionless. I saw, indeed, her heart heave, her\nlips were a little apart, her breathing grew somewhat hurried; the child\nsmiled; then at last the mother smiled too, and said in low soliloquy,\n\"God bless my little son!\" She stooped closer over him, breathed the\nsoftest of kisses on his brow, covered his minute hand with hers, and\nat last started up and came away. I regained the parlour before her.\nEntering it two minutes later she said quietly as she put down her\nextinguished lamp--\n\n\"Victor rests well: he smiled in his sleep; he has your smile,\nmonsieur.\"\n\nThe said Victor was of course her own boy, born in the third year of\nour marriage: his Christian name had been given him in honour of M.\nVandenhuten, who continued always our trusty and well-beloved friend.\n\nFrances was then a good and dear wife to me, because I was to her a\ngood, just, and faithful husband. What she would have been had she\nmarried a harsh, envious, careless man--a profligate, a prodigal,\na drunkard, or a tyrant--is another question, and one which I once\npropounded to her. Her answer, given after some reflection, was--\n\n\"I should have tried to endure the evil or cure it for awhile; and when\nI found it intolerable and incurable, I should have left my torturer\nsuddenly and silently.\"\n\n\"And if law or might had forced you back again?\"\n\n\"What, to a drunkard, a profligate, a selfish spendthrift, an unjust\nfool?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I would have gone back; again assured myself whether or not his vice\nand my misery were capable of remedy; and if not, have left him again.\"\n\n\"And if again forced to return, and compelled to abide?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, hastily. \"Why do you ask me, monsieur?\"\n\nI would have an answer, because I saw a strange kind of spirit in her\neye, whose voice I determined to waken.\n\n\"Monsieur, if a wife's nature loathes that of the man she is wedded to,\nmarriage must be slavery. Against slavery all right thinkers revolt, and\nthough torture be the price of resistance, torture must be dared: though\nthe only road to freedom lie through the gates of death, those gates\nmust be passed; for freedom is indispensable. Then, monsieur, I would\nresist as far as my strength permitted; when that strength failed I\nshould be sure of a refuge. Death would certainly screen me both from\nbad laws and their consequences.\"\n\n\"Voluntary death, Frances?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. I'd have courage to live out every throe of anguish fate\nassigned me, and principle to contend for justice and liberty to the\nlast.\"\n\n\"I see you would have made no patient Grizzle. And now, supposing fate\nhad merely assigned you the lot of an old maid, what then? How would you\nhave liked celibacy?\"\n\n\"Not much, certainly. An old maid's life must doubtless be void and\nvapid--her heart strained and empty. Had I been an old maid I should\nhave spent existence in efforts to fill the void and ease the aching. I\nshould have probably failed, and died weary and disappointed, despised\nand of no account, like other single women. But I'm not an old maid,\"\nshe added quickly. \"I should have been, though, but for my master. I\nshould never have suited any man but Professor Crimsworth--no other\ngentleman, French, English, or Belgian, would have thought me amiable or\nhandsome; and I doubt whether I should have cared for the approbation\nof many others, if I could have obtained it. Now, I have been Professor\nCrimsworth's wife eight years, and what is he in my eyes? Is he\nhonourable, beloved ----?\" She stopped, her voice was cut off, her eyes\nsuddenly suffused. She and I were standing side by side; she threw her\narms round me, and strained me to her heart with passionate earnestness:\nthe energy of her whole being glowed in her dark and then dilated\neye, and crimsoned her animated cheek; her look and movement were like\ninspiration; in one there was such a flash, in the other such a power.\nHalf an hour afterwards, when she had become calm, I asked where all\nthat wild vigour was gone which had transformed her ere-while and made\nher glance so thrilling and ardent--her action so rapid and strong. She\nlooked down, smiling softly and passively:--\n\n\"I cannot tell where it is gone, monsieur,\" said she, \"but I know that,\nwhenever it is wanted, it will come back again.\"\n\nBehold us now at the close of the ten years, and we have realized an\nindependency. The rapidity with which we attained this end had its\norigin in three reasons:-- Firstly, we worked so hard for it; secondly,\nwe had no incumbrances to delay success; thirdly, as soon as we had\ncapital to invest, two well-skilled counsellors, one in Belgium, one in\nEngland, viz. Vandenhuten and Hunsden, gave us each a word of advice\nas to the sort of investment to be chosen. The suggestion made was\njudicious; and, being promptly acted on, the result proved gainful--I\nneed not say how gainful; I communicated details to Messrs. Vandenhuten\nand Hunsden; nobody else can be interested in hearing them.\n\nAccounts being wound up, and our professional connection disposed of, we\nboth agreed that, as mammon was not our master, nor his service that in\nwhich we desired to spend our lives; as our desires were temperate, and\nour habits unostentatious, we had now abundance to live on--abundance to\nleave our boy; and should besides always have a balance on hand, which,\nproperly managed by right sympathy and unselfish activity, might\nhelp philanthropy in her enterprises, and put solace into the hand of\ncharity.\n\nTo England we now resolved to take wing; we arrived there safely;\nFrances realized the dream of her lifetime. We spent a whole summer\nand autumn in travelling from end to end of the British islands, and\nafterwards passed a winter in London. Then we thought it high time\nto fix our residence. My heart yearned towards my native county of\n----shire; and it is in ----shire I now live; it is in the library of my\nown home I am now writing. That home lies amid a sequestered and rather\nhilly region, thirty miles removed from X----; a region whose verdure\nthe smoke of mills has not yet sullied, whose waters still run pure,\nwhose swells of moorland preserve in some ferny glens that lie between\nthem the very primal wildness of nature, her moss, her bracken, her\nblue-bells, her scents of reed and heather, her free and fresh breezes.\nMy house is a picturesque and not too spacious dwelling, with low and\nlong windows, a trellised and leaf-veiled porch over the front door,\njust now, on this summer evening, looking like an arch of roses and ivy.\nThe garden is chiefly laid out in lawn, formed of the sod of the hills,\nwith herbage short and soft as moss, full of its own peculiar flowers,\ntiny and starlike, imbedded in the minute embroidery of their fine\nfoliage. At the bottom of the sloping garden there is a wicket, which\nopens upon a lane as green as the lawn, very long, shady, and little\nfrequented; on the turf of this lane generally appear the first daisies\nof spring--whence its name--Daisy Lane; serving also as a distinction to\nthe house.\n\nIt terminates (the lane I mean) in a valley full of wood; which\nwood--chiefly oak and beech--spreads shadowy about the vicinage of a\nvery old mansion, one of the Elizabethan structures, much larger, as\nwell as more antique than Daisy Lane, the property and residence of\nan individual familiar both to me and to the reader. Yes, in Hunsden\nWood--for so are those glades and that grey building, with many gables\nand more chimneys, named--abides Yorke Hunsden, still unmarried; never,\nI suppose, having yet found his ideal, though I know at least a score\nof young ladies within a circuit of forty miles, who would be willing to\nassist him in the search.\n\nThe estate fell to him by the death of his father, five years since; he\nhas given up trade, after having made by it sufficient to pay off some\nincumbrances by which the family heritage was burdened. I say he abides\nhere, but I do not think he is resident above five months out of the\ntwelve; he wanders from land to land, and spends some part of each\nwinter in town: he frequently brings visitors with him when he comes to\n----shire, and these visitors are often foreigners; sometimes he has\na German metaphysician, sometimes a French savant; he had once a\ndissatisfied and savage-looking Italian, who neither sang nor played,\nand of whom Frances affirmed that he had \"tout l'air d'un conspirateur.\"\n\nWhat English guests Hunsden invites, are all either men of Birmingham or\nManchester--hard men, seemingly knit up in one thought, whose talk is\nof free trade. The foreign visitors, too, are politicians; they take a\nwider theme--European progress--the spread of liberal sentiments over\nthe Continent; on their mental tablets, the names of Russia, Austria,\nand the Pope, are inscribed in red ink. I have heard some of them talk\nvigorous sense--yea, I have been present at polyglot discussions in the\nold, oak-lined dining-room at Hunsden Wood, where a singular insight\nwas given of the sentiments entertained by resolute minds respecting old\nnorthern despotisms, and old southern superstitions: also, I have heard\nmuch twaddle, enounced chiefly in French and Deutsch, but let that pass.\nHunsden himself tolerated the drivelling theorists; with the practical\nmen he seemed leagued hand and heart.\n\nWhen Hunsden is staying alone at the Wood (which seldom happens) he\ngenerally finds his way two or three times a week to Daisy Lane. He has\na philanthropic motive for coming to smoke his cigar in our porch on\nsummer evenings; he says he does it to kill the earwigs amongst the\nroses, with which insects, but for his benevolent fumigations, he\nintimates we should certainly be overrun. On wet days, too, we are\nalmost sure to see him; according to him, it gets on time to work\nme into lunacy by treading on my mental corns, or to force from Mrs.\nCrimsworth revelations of the dragon within her, by insulting the memory\nof Hofer and Tell.\n\nWe also go frequently to Hunsden Wood, and both I and Frances relish a\nvisit there highly. If there are other guests, their characters are\nan interesting study; their conversation is exciting and strange; the\nabsence of all local narrowness both in the host and his chosen society\ngives a metropolitan, almost a cosmopolitan freedom and largeness to the\ntalk. Hunsden himself is a polite man in his own house: he has, when he\nchooses to employ it, an inexhaustible power of entertaining guests; his\nvery mansion too is interesting, the rooms look storied, the\npassages legendary, the low-ceiled chambers, with their long rows of\ndiamond-paned lattices, have an old-world, haunted air: in his travels\nhe has collected stores of articles of VERTU, which are well and\ntastefully disposed in his panelled or tapestried rooms: I have seen\nthere one or two pictures, and one or two pieces of statuary which many\nan aristocratic connoisseur might have envied.\n\nWhen I and Frances have dined and spent an evening with Hunsden, he\noften walks home with us. His wood is large, and some of the timber\nis old and of huge growth. There are winding ways in it which, pursued\nthrough glade and brake, make the walk back to Daisy Lane a somewhat\nlong one. Many a time, when we have had the benefit of a full moon,\nand when the night has been mild and balmy, when, moreover, a certain\nnightingale has been singing, and a certain stream, hid in alders, has\nlent the song a soft accompaniment, the remote church-bell of the one\nhamlet in a district of ten miles, has tolled midnight ere the lord of\nthe wood left us at our porch. Free-flowing was his talk at such hours,\nand far more quiet and gentle than in the day-time and before numbers.\nHe would then forget politics and discussion, and would dwell on the\npast times of his house, on his family history, on himself and his own\nfeelings--subjects each and all invested with a peculiar zest, for they\nwere each and all unique. One glorious night in June, after I had been\ntaunting him about his ideal bride and asking him when she would\ncome and graft her foreign beauty on the old Hunsden oak, he answered\nsuddenly--\n\n\"You call her ideal; but see, here is her shadow; and there cannot be a\nshadow without a substance.\"\n\nHe had led us from the depth of the \"winding way\" into a glade from\nwhence the beeches withdrew, leaving it open to the sky; an unclouded\nmoon poured her light into this glade, and Hunsden held out under her\nbeam an ivory miniature.\n\nFrances, with eagerness, examined it first; then she gave it to\nme--still, however, pushing her little face close to mine, and seeking\nin my eyes what I thought of the portrait. I thought it represented a\nvery handsome and very individual-looking female face, with, as he had\nonce said, \"straight and harmonious features.\" It was dark; the hair,\nraven-black, swept not only from the brow, but from the temples--seemed\nthrust away carelessly, as if such beauty dispensed with, nay,\ndespised arrangement. The Italian eye looked straight into you, and an\nindependent, determined eye it was; the mouth was as firm as fine; the\nchin ditto. On the back of the miniature was gilded \"Lucia.\"\n\n\"That is a real head,\" was my conclusion.\n\nHunsden smiled.\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied. \"All was real in Lucia.\"\n\n\"And she was somebody you would have liked to marry--but could not?\"\n\n\"I should certainly have liked to marry her, and that I HAVE not done so\nis a proof that I COULD not.\"\n\nHe repossessed himself of the miniature, now again in Frances' hand, and\nput it away.\n\n\"What do YOU think of it?\" he asked of my wife, as he buttoned his coat\nover it.\n\n\"I am sure Lucia once wore chains and broke them,\" was the strange\nanswer. \"I do not mean matrimonial chains,\" she added, correcting\nherself, as if she feared mis-interpretation, \"but social chains of some\nsort. The face is that of one who has made an effort, and a successful\nand triumphant effort, to wrest some vigorous and valued faculty from\ninsupportable constraint; and when Lucia's faculty got free, I am\ncertain it spread wide pinions and carried her higher than--\" she\nhesitated.\n\n\"Than what?\" demanded Hunsden.\n\n\"Than 'les convenances' permitted you to follow.\"\n\n\"I think you grow spiteful--impertinent.\"\n\n\"Lucia has trodden the stage,\" continued Frances. \"You never seriously\nthought of marrying her; you admired her originality, her fearlessness,\nher energy of body and mind; you delighted in her talent, whatever that\nwas, whether song, dance, or dramatic representation; you worshipped her\nbeauty, which was of the sort after your own heart: but I am sure she\nfilled a sphere from whence you would never have thought of taking a\nwife.\"\n\n\"Ingenious,\" remarked Hunsden; \"whether true or not is another question.\nMeantime, don't you feel your little lamp of a spirit wax very pale,\nbeside such a girandole as Lucia's?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candid, at least; and the Professor will soon be dissatisfied with the\ndim light you give?\"\n\n\"Will you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"My sight was always too weak to endure a blaze, Frances,\" and we had\nnow reached the wicket.\n\nI said, a few pages back, that this is a sweet summer evening; it\nis--there has been a series of lovely days, and this is the loveliest;\nthe hay is just carried from my fields, its perfume still lingers in the\nair. Frances proposed to me, an hour or two since, to take tea out\non the lawn; I see the round table, loaded with china, placed under a\ncertain beech; Hunsden is expected--nay, I hear he is come--there is his\nvoice, laying down the law on some point with authority; that of Frances\nreplies; she opposes him of course. They are disputing about Victor,\nof whom Hunsden affirms that his mother is making a milksop. Mrs.\nCrimsworth retaliates:--\n\n\"Better a thousand times he should be a milksop than what he, Hunsden,\ncalls 'a fine lad;' and moreover she says that if Hunsden were to become\na fixture in the neighbourhood, and were not a mere comet, coming and\ngoing, no one knows how, when, where, or why, she should be quite uneasy\ntill she had got Victor away to a school at least a hundred miles off;\nfor that with his mutinous maxims and unpractical dogmas, he would ruin\na score of children.\"\n\nI have a word to say of Victor ere I shut this manuscript in my\ndesk--but it must be a brief one, for I hear the tinkle of silver on\nporcelain.\n\nVictor is as little of a pretty child as I am of a handsome man, or his\nmother of a fine woman; he is pale and spare, with large eyes, as dark\nas those of Frances, and as deeply set as mine. His shape is symmetrical\nenough, but slight; his health is good. I never saw a child smile less\nthan he does, nor one who knits such a formidable brow when sitting over\na book that interests him, or while listening to tales of adventure,\nperil, or wonder, narrated by his mother, Hunsden, or myself. But\nthough still, he is not unhappy--though serious, not morose; he has a\nsusceptibility to pleasurable sensations almost too keen, for it amounts\nto enthusiasm. He learned to read in the old-fashioned way out of a\nspelling-book at his mother's knee, and as he got on without driving by\nthat method, she thought it unnecessary to buy him ivory letters, or to\ntry any of the other inducements to learning now deemed indispensable.\nWhen he could read, he became a glutton of books, and is so still.\nHis toys have been few, and he has never wanted more. For those he\npossesses, he seems to have contracted a partiality amounting to\naffection; this feeling, directed towards one or two living animals of\nthe house, strengthens almost to a passion.\n\nMr. Hunsden gave him a mastiff cub, which he called Yorke, after the\ndonor; it grew to a superb dog, whose fierceness, however, was much\nmodified by the companionship and caresses of its young master. He would\ngo nowhere, do nothing without Yorke; Yorke lay at his feet while he\nlearned his lessons, played with him in the garden, walked with him in\nthe lane and wood, sat near his chair at meals, was fed always by his\nown hand, was the first thing he sought in the morning, the last he left\nat night. Yorke accompanied Mr. Hunsden one day to X----, and was bitten\nin the street by a dog in a rabid state. As soon as Hunsden had brought\nhim home, and had informed me of the circumstance, I went into the yard\nand shot him where he lay licking his wound: he was dead in an instant;\nhe had not seen me level the gun; I stood behind him. I had scarcely\nbeen ten minutes in the house, when my ear was struck with sounds of\nanguish: I repaired to the yard once more, for they proceeded thence.\nVictor was kneeling beside his dead mastiff, bent over it, embracing its\nbull-like neck, and lost in a passion of the wildest woe: he saw me.\n\n\"Oh, papa, I'll never forgive you! I'll never forgive you!\" was his\nexclamation. \"You shot Yorke--I saw it from the window. I never believed\nyou could be so cruel--I can love you no more!\"\n\nI had much ado to explain to him, with a steady voice, the stern\nnecessity of the deed; he still, with that inconsolable and bitter\naccent which I cannot render, but which pierced my heart, repeated--\n\n\"He might have been cured--you should have tried--you should have burnt\nthe wound with a hot iron, or covered it with caustic. You gave no time;\nand now it is too late--he is dead!\"\n\nHe sank fairly down on the senseless carcase; I waited patiently a long\nwhile, till his grief had somewhat exhausted him; and then I lifted him\nin my arms and carried him to his mother, sure that she would comfort\nhim best. She had witnessed the whole scene from a window; she would not\ncome out for fear of increasing my difficulties by her emotion, but she\nwas ready now to receive him. She took him to her kind heart, and on\nto her gentle lap; consoled him but with her lips, her eyes, her soft\nembrace, for some time; and then, when his sobs diminished, told him\nthat Yorke had felt no pain in dying, and that if he had been left to\nexpire naturally, his end would have been most horrible; above all, she\ntold him that I was not cruel (for that idea seemed to give exquisite\npain to poor Victor), that it was my affection for Yorke and him which\nhad made me act so, and that I was now almost heart-broken to see him\nweep thus bitterly.\n\nVictor would have been no true son of his father, had these\nconsiderations, these reasons, breathed in so low, so sweet a\ntone--married to caresses so benign, so tender--to looks so inspired\nwith pitying sympathy--produced no effect on him. They did produce an\neffect: he grew calmer, rested his face on her shoulder, and lay still\nin her arms. Looking up, shortly, he asked his mother to tell him over\nagain what she had said about Yorke having suffered no pain, and my not\nbeing cruel; the balmy words being repeated, he again pillowed his cheek\non her breast, and was again tranquil.\n\nSome hours after, he came to me in my library, asked if I forgave him,\nand desired to be reconciled. I drew the lad to my side, and there I\nkept him a good while, and had much talk with him, in the course of\nwhich he disclosed many points of feeling and thought I approved of in\nmy son. I found, it is true, few elements of the \"good fellow\" or the\n\"fine fellow\" in him; scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash\nover the wine cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying\nfire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs\nof compassion, affection, fidelity. I discovered in the garden of his\nintellect a rich growth of wholesome principles--reason, justice, moral\ncourage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile bearing. So I bestowed on\nhis large forehead, and on his cheek--still pale with tears--a proud and\ncontented kiss, and sent him away comforted. Yet I saw him the next day\nlaid on the mound under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered\nwith his hands; he was melancholy for some weeks, and more than a year\nelapsed before he would listen to any proposal of having another dog.\n\nVictor learns fast. He must soon go to Eton, where, I suspect, his first\nyear or two will be utter wretchedness: to leave me, his mother, and his\nhome, will give his heart an agonized wrench; then, the fagging will not\nsuit him--but emulation, thirst after knowledge, the glory of success,\nwill stir and reward him in time. Meantime, I feel in myself a strong\nrepugnance to fix the hour which will uproot my sole olive branch, and\ntransplant it far from me; and, when I speak to Frances on the subject,\nI am heard with a kind of patient pain, as though I alluded to some\nfearful operation, at which her nature shudders, but from which her\nfortitude will not permit her to recoil. The step must, however, be\ntaken, and it shall be; for, though Frances will not make a milksop of\nher son, she will accustom him to a style of treatment, a forbearance,\na congenial tenderness, he will meet with from none else. She sees, as\nI also see, a something in Victor's temper--a kind of electrical ardour\nand power--which emits, now and then, ominous sparks; Hunsden calls it\nhis spirit, and says it should not be curbed. I call it the leaven of\nthe offending Adam, and consider that it should be, if not WHIPPED out\nof him, at least soundly disciplined; and that he will be cheap of\nany amount of either bodily or mental suffering which will ground him\nradically in the art of self-control. Frances gives this something in\nher son's marked character no name; but when it appears in the grinding\nof his teeth, in the glittering of his eye, in the fierce revolt of\nfeeling against disappointment, mischance, sudden sorrow, or supposed\ninjustice, she folds him to her breast, or takes him to walk with her\nalone in the wood; then she reasons with him like any philosopher, and\nto reason Victor is ever accessible; then she looks at him with eyes of\nlove, and by love Victor can be infallibly subjugated; but will reason\nor love be the weapons with which in future the world will meet his\nviolence? Oh, no! for that flash in his black eye--for that cloud on\nhis bony brow--for that compression of his statuesque lips, the lad will\nsome day get blows instead of blandishments--kicks instead of kisses;\nthen for the fit of mute fury which will sicken his body and madden\nhis soul; then for the ordeal of merited and salutary suffering, out of\nwhich he will come (I trust) a wiser and a better man.\n\nI see him now; he stands by Hunsden, who is seated on the lawn under the\nbeech; Hunsden's hand rests on the boy's collar, and he is instilling\nGod knows what principles into his ear. Victor looks well just now, for\nhe listens with a sort of smiling interest; he never looks so like his\nmother as when he smiles--pity the sunshine breaks out so rarely! Victor\nhas a preference for Hunsden, full as strong as I deem desirable, being\nconsiderably more potent, decided, and indiscriminating, than any I ever\nentertained for that personage myself. Frances, too, regards it with a\nsort of unexpressed anxiety; while her son leans on Hunsden's knee, or\nrests against his shoulder, she roves with restless movement round,\nlike a dove guarding its young from a hovering hawk; she says she wishes\nHunsden had children of his own, for then he would better know the\ndanger of inciting their pride end indulging their foibles.\n\nFrances approaches my library window; puts aside the honeysuckle which\nhalf covers it, and tells me tea is ready; seeing that I continue busy\nshe enters the room, comes near me quietly, and puts her hand on my\nshoulder.\n\n\"Monsieur est trop applique.\"\n\n\"I shall soon have done.\"\n\nShe draws a chair near, and sits down to wait till I have finished; her\npresence is as pleasant to my mind as the perfume of the fresh hay and\nspicy flowers, as the glow of the westering sun, as the repose of the\nmidsummer eve are to my senses.\n\nBut Hunsden comes; I hear his step, and there he is, bending through the\nlattice, from which he has thrust away the woodbine with unsparing hand,\ndisturbing two bees and a butterfly.\n\n\"Crimsworth! I say, Crimsworth! take that pen out of his hand, mistress,\nand make him lift up his head.\"\n\n\"Well, Hunsden? I hear you--\"\n\n\"I was at X---- yesterday! your brother Ned is getting richer than\nCroesus by railway speculations; they call him in the Piece Hall a stag\nof ten; and I have heard from Brown. M. and Madame Vandenhuten and Jean\nBaptiste talk of coming to see you next month. He mentions the Pelets\ntoo; he says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world, but\nin business they are doing 'on ne peut mieux,' which circumstance\nhe concludes will be a sufficient consolation to both for any little\ncrosses in the affections. Why don't you invite the Pelets to ----shire,\nCrimsworth? I should so like to see your first flame, Zoraide. Mistress,\ndon't be jealous, but he loved that lady to distraction; I know it for a\nfact. Brown says she weighs twelve stones now; you see what you've\nlost, Mr. Professor. Now, Monsieur and Madame, if you don't come to tea,\nVictor and I will begin without you.\"\n\n\"Papa, come!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Professor, by (AKA Charlotte\nBronte) Currer Bell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROFESSOR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1028.txt or 1028.zip ***** This and\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/2\/1028\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\nFoundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state\nof Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue\nService. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number\nis 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\nplease visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n","id":971,"split":"train"}
