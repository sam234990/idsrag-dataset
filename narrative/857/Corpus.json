While he is working on this, two man-eating lions show up. They will stop at nothing for a bite of human flesh and the first attempts to stalk, capture or keep them out of the camp fail. They attack the camp hospital and kill a patient. Even after the hospital is moved, one lion penetrates the thick, thorn fence called a boma built to protect it and drags the water carrier away to his death. In the course of hunting these lions, Patterson encounters a red spitting cobra, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a pack of wild dogs, a wildebeest that faked dying, and a herd of zebra, of which he captured six. He also shoots a new type of antelope, T. oryx pattersonianus. Eventually, the first lion is defeated by baiting it with a tethered goat while Patterson keeps watch from an elevated stand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 though for a few tense moments Patterson himself becomes the hunted. Patterson and Mahina hunt the second lion on the plains. When they find and shoot it, the lion charges them and it takes repeated shots to bring it down.\nThe lions are not the only challenge to completing the bridge project. Tensions between native workers and Sikhs brought in from British East India to work on the project (coolies) threaten to stop the project. At one point, Patterson meets a danger far greater than the lions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fierce flood. It wipes out the supply bridges and wraps iron girders around tree trunks like wire. Uprooted tree trunks act like battering rams trying to annihilate the bridge. But the well-built bridge stays intact. This challenge proves that the year spent working on the bridge has not been wasted.\nAfter Patterson completes the bridge, he learns that a lion has been trying to destroy the train station. When he goes to see, he finds big bloodstains where the lion was trying to slash the roof. There were 3 men in one compartment and an uncertain number of coolies in another. Two of the men had been sleeping on the floor when the lion gained entrance. The lion was on one of the men while trying to attack another. The third man, in an effort to get to the other section, which the coolies had been holding shut with their turbans, leapt on to the lion's back, and tried desperately to get through. The coolies opened the door just wide enough for him to get through, and then tied it shut again. As for the other men, one got carried off and eaten by the lion, while the other man lay very still, probably saving his own life. Hearing this, Patterson decides to go after this lion, eventually finding it and slaughtering it.\nAnother close encounter with a lion occurs when a lion is aboard a gharri, a means of transportation in Kenya similar to a small trolley. Another time, on the way back to the train station, Patterson converses with a friend who has never shot a lion. A couple of hundred yards away, Patterson points out a pair of lions and encourages the friend to shoot them. One runs off at the first shot, but he successfully bags the other lion. The end of the book includes a photo of the lion that the friend killed.\nWhen the time comes for Patterson to leave, some of the coolies and the natives want to go with him. However, Patterson knows that they do not have the immune defense system to combat the diseases outside of Africa. So he politely says no and leaves Africa for some years. (He later returns to Africa, but this part of his life is not recorded in this book.)\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Man-eaters of Tsavo and Other East\nAfrican Adventures, by J.

Patterson, D.S.O.\n\n\n\n\nWITH A FOREWORD BY FREDERICK COURTENEY SELOUS\n\n\nWITH ILLUSTRATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nIt is with feelings of the greatest diffidence that I place the\nfollowing pages before the public; but those of my friends who happen\nto have heard of my rather unique experiences in the wilds have so\noften urged me to write an account of my adventures, that after much\nhesitation I at last determined to do so.\n\nI have no doubt that many of my readers, who have perhaps never been\nvery far away from civilisation, will be inclined to think that some of\nthe incidents are exaggerated. I can only assure them that I have toned\ndown the facts rather than otherwise, and have endeavoured to write a\nperfectly plain and straightforward account of things as they actually\nhappened.\n\nIt must be remembered that at the time these events occurred, the\nconditions prevailing in British East Africa were very different from\nwhat they are to-day. The railway, which has modernised the aspect of\nthe place and brought civilisation in its train, was then only in\nprocess of construction, and the country through which it was being\nbuilt was still in its primitive savage state, as indeed, away from the\nrailway, it still is.\n\nIf this simple account of two years' work and play in the wilds should\nprove of any interest, or help even in a small way to call attention to\nthe beautiful and valuable country which we possess on the Equator, I\nshall feel more than compensated for the trouble I have taken in\nwriting it.\n\nI am much indebted to the Hon. Mrs. Cyril Ward, Sir Guilford\nMolesworth, K.C.I.E., Mr. T.J. Spooner and Mr C. Rawson for their\nkindness in allowing me to reproduce photographs taken by them. My\nwarmest thanks are also due to that veteran pioneer of Africa, Mr. F.C.\nSelous, for giving my little book so kindly an introduction to the\npublic as is provided by the \"Foreword\" which he has been good enough\nto write.\n\nJ.H.P. August, 1907.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD\n\n\nIt was some seven or eight years ago that I first read, in the pages of\nThe Field newspaper, a brief account written by Col. J.H. Patterson,\nthen an engineer engaged on the construction of the Uganda Railway, of\nthe Tsavo man-eating lions.\n\nMy own long experience of African hunting told me at once that every\nword in this thrilling narrative was absolutely true. Nay more: I knew\nthat the author had told his story in a most modest manner, laying but\nlittle stress on the dangers he had run when sitting up at nights to\ntry and compass the death of the terrible man-eaters, especially on\nthat one occasion when whilst watching from a very light scaffolding,\nsupported only by four rickety poles, he was himself stalked by one of\nthe dread beasts. Fortunately he did not lose his nerve, and succeeded\nin shooting the lion, just when it was on the point of springing upon\nhim. But had this lion approached him from behind, I think it would\nprobably have added Col. Patterson to its long list of victims, for in\nmy own experience I have known of three instances of men having been\npulled from trees or huts built on platforms at a greater height from\nthe ground than the crazy structure on which Col. Patterson was\nwatching on that night of terrors.\n\nFrom the time of Herodotus until to-day, lion stories innumerable have\nbeen told and written. I have put some on record myself. But no lion\nstory I have ever heard or read equals in its long-sustained and\ndramatic interest the story of the Tsavo man-eaters as told by Col.\nPatterson. A lion story is usually a tale of adventures, often very\nterrible and pathetic, which occupied but a few hours of one night; but\nthe tale of the Tsavo man-eaters is an epic of terrible tragedies\nspread out over several months, and only at last brought to an end by\nthe resource and determination of one man.\n\nIt was some years after I read the first account published of the Tsavo\nman-eaters that I made the acquaintance of President Roosevelt. I told\nhim all I remembered about it, and he was so deeply interested in the\nstory--as he is in all true stories of the nature and characteristics\nof wild animals--that he begged me to send him the short printed\naccount as published in The Field. This I did; and it was only in the\nlast letter I received from him that, referring to this story,\nPresident Roosevelt wrote: \"I think that the incident of the Uganda\nman-eating lions, described in those two articles you sent me, is the\nmost remarkable account of which we have any record. It is a great pity\nthat it should not be preserved in permanent form.\" Well, I am now glad\nto think that it will be preserved in permanent form; and I venture to\nassure Col. Patterson that President Roosevelt will be amongst the most\ninterested readers of his book.\n\nIt is probable that the chapters recounting the story of the Tsavo\nman-eating lions will be found more absorbing than the other portions\nof Col. Patterson's book; but I think that most of his readers will\nagree with me that the whole volume is full of interest and\ninformation. The account given by Col. Patterson of how he overcame all\nthe difficulties which confronted him in building a strong and\npermanent railway bridge across the Tsavo river makes excellent\nreading; whilst the courage he displayed in attacking, single-handed,\nlions, rhinoceroses and other dangerous animals was surpassed by the\npluck, tact and determination he showed in quelling the formidable\nmutiny which once broke out amongst his native Indian workers.\n\nFinally, let me say that I have spent the best part of two nights\nreading the proof-sheets of Col. Patterson's book, and I can assure him\nthat the time passed like magic. My interest was held from the first\npage to the last, for I felt that every word I read was true.\n\nF. C.

somewhat dangerous harbour of Mombasa, on the\neast coast of Africa. The town lies on an island of the same name,\nseparated from the mainland only by a very narrow channel, which forms\nthe harbour; and as our vessel steamed slowly in, close under the\nquaint old Portuguese fortress built over three hundred years ago, I\nwas much struck with the strange beauty of the view which gradually\nopened out before me. Contrary to my anticipation, everything looked\nfresh and green, and an oriental glamour of enchantment seemed to hang\nover the island. The old town was bathed in brilliant sunshine and\nreflected itself lazily on the motionless sea; its flat roofs and\ndazzlingly white walls peeped out dreamily between waving palms and\nlofty cocoanuts, huge baobabs and spreading mango trees; and the darker\nbackground of well-wooded hills and slopes on the mainland formed a\nvery effective setting to a beautiful and, to me, unexpected picture.\n\nThe harbour was plentifully sprinkled with Arab dhows, in some of\nwhich, I believe, even at the present day, a few slaves are\noccasionally smuggled off to Persia and Arabia. It has always been a\nmatter of great wonder to me how the navigators of little vessels find\ntheir way from port to port, as they do, without the aid of either\ncompass or sextant, and how they manage to weather the terrible storms\nthat at certain seasons of the year suddenly visit eastern seas. I\nremember once coming across a dhow becalmed in the middle of the Indian\nOcean, and its crew making signals of distress, our captain slowed down\nto investigate. There were four men on board, all nearly dead from\nthirst; they had been without drink of any kind for several days and\nhad completely lost their bearings. After giving them some casks of\nwater, we directed them to Muscat (the port they wished to make), and\nour vessel resumed its journey, leaving them still becalmed in the\nmidst of that glassy sea. Whether they managed to reach their\ndestination I never knew.\n\nAs our steamer made its way to its anchorage, the romantic surroundings\nof the harbour of Mombasa conjured up, visions of stirring adventures\nof the past, and recalled to my mind the many tales of reckless doings\nof pirates and slavers, which as a boy it had been my delight to read.\nI remembered that it was at this very place that in 1498 the great\nVasco da Gama nearly lost his ship and life through the treachery of\nhis Arab pilot, who plotted to wreck the vessel on the reef which bars\nmore than half the entrance to the harbour. Luckily, this nefarious\ndesign was discovered in time, and the bold navigator promptly hanged\nthe pilot, and would also have sacked the town but for the timely\nsubmission and apologies of the Sultan. In the principal street of\nMombasa--appropriately called Vasco da Gama Street--there still stands\na curiously shaped pillar which is said to have been erected by this\ngreat seaman in commemoration of his visit.\n\nScarcely had the anchor been dropped, when, as if by magic, our vessel\nwas surrounded by a fleet of small boats and \"dug-outs\" manned by\ncrowds of shouting and gesticulating natives. After a short fight\nbetween some rival Swahili boatmen for my baggage and person, I found\nmyself being vigorously rowed to the foot of the landing steps by the\nbahareen (sailors) who had been successful in the encounter. Now, my\nobject in coming out to East Africa at this time was to take up a\nposition to which I had been appointed by the Foreign Office on the\nconstruction staff of the Uganda Railway. As soon as I landed,\ntherefore, I enquired from one of the Customs officials where the\nheadquarters of the railway were to be found, and was told that they\nwere at a place called Kilindini, some three miles away, on the other\nside of the island. The best way to get there, I was further informed,\nwas by gharri, which I found to be a small trolley, having two seats\nplaced back to back under a little canopy and running on narrow rails\nwhich are laid through the principal street of the town. Accordingly, I\nsecured one of these vehicles, which are pushed by two strapping\nSwahili boys, and was soon flying down the track, which once outside\nthe town lay for the most part through dense groves of mango, baobab,\nbanana and palm trees, with here and there brilliantly coloured\ncreepers hanging in luxuriant festoons from the branches.\n\nOn arrival at Kilindini, I made my way to the railway Offices and was\ninformed that I should be stationed inland and should receive further\ninstructions in the course of a day or two. Meanwhile I pitched my tent\nunder some shady palms near the gharri line, and busied myself in\nexploring the island and in procuring the stores and the outfit\nnecessary for a lengthy sojourn up-country. The town of Mombasa itself\nnaturally occupied most of my attention. It is supposed to have been\nfounded about A.D. 1000, but the discovery of ancient Egyptian idols,\nand of coins of the early Persian and Chinese dynasties, goes to show\nthat it must at different ages have been settled by people of the very\nearliest civilisations. Coming to more modern times, it was held on and\noff from 1505 to 1729 by the Portuguese, a permanent memorial of whose\noccupation remains in the shape of the grim old fortress, built about\n1593--on the site, it is believed, of a still older stronghold. These\nenterprising sea-rovers piously named it \"Jesus Fort,\" and an\ninscription recording this is still to be seen over the main entrance.\nThe Portuguese occupation of Mombasa was, however, not without its\nvicissitudes. From March 15, 1696, for example, the town was besieged\nfor thirty-three consecutive months by a large fleet of Arab dhows,\nwhich completely surrounded the island. In spite of plague, treachery\nand famine, the little garrison held out valiantly in Jesus Fort, to\nwhich they had been forced to retire, until December 12, 1698, when the\nArabs made a last determined attack and captured the citadel, putting\nthe remnant of the defenders, both men and women, to the sword. It is\npathetic to read that only two days later a large Portuguese fleet\nappeared off the harbour, bringing the long-looked-for reinforcements.\nAfter this the Portuguese made several attempts to reconquer Mombasa,\nbut were unsuccessful until 1728, when the town was stormed and\ncaptured by General Sampayo. The Arabs, however, returned the next year\nin overwhelming numbers, and again drove the Portuguese out; and\nalthough the latter made one more attempt in 1769 to regain their\nsupremacy, they did not succeed.\n\nThe Arabs, as represented by the Sultan of Zanzibar, remain in nominal\npossession of Mombasa to the present day; but in 1887 Seyid Bargash,\nthe then Sultan of Zanzibar, gave for an annual rental a concession of\nhis mainland territories to the British East Africa Association, which\nin 1888 was formed into the Imperial British East Africa Company. In\n1895 the Foreign Office took over control of the Company's possessions,\nand a Protectorate was proclaimed; and ten years later the\nadministration of the country was transferred to the Colonial Office.\n\nThe last serious fighting on the island took place so recently as\n1895-6, when a Swahili chief named M'baruk bin Rashed, who had three\ntimes previously risen in rebellion against the Sultan of Zanzibar,\nattempted to defy the British and to throw off their yoke. He was\ndefeated on several occasions, however, and was finally forced to flee\nsouthwards into German territory. Altogether, Mombasa has in the past\nwell deserved its native name of Kisiwa M'vitaa, or \"Isle of War\"; but\nunder the settled rule now obtaining, it is rapidly becoming a thriving\nand prosperous town, and as the port of entry for Uganda, it does a\nlarge forwarding trade with the interior and has several excellent\nstores where almost anything, from a needle to an anchor, may readily\nbe obtained.\n\nKilindini is, as I have said, on the opposite side of the island, and\nas its name--\"the place of deep waters\"--implies, has a much finer\nharbour than that possessed by Mombasa. The channel between the island\nand the mainland is here capable of giving commodious and safe\nanchorage to the very largest vessels, and as the jetty is directly\nconnected with the Uganda Railway, Kilindini has now really become the\nprincipal port, being always used by the liners and heavier vessels.\n\nI had spent nearly a week in Mombasa, and was becoming very anxious to\nget my marching orders, when one morning I was delighted to receive an\nofficial letter instructing me to proceed to Tsavo, about one hundred\nand thirty-two miles from the coast, and to take charge of the\nconstruction of the section of the line at that place, which had just\nthen been reached by railhead. I accordingly started at daylight next\nmorning in a special train with Mr. Anderson, the Superintendent of\nWorks, and Dr. McCulloch, the principal Medical Officer; and as the\ncountry was in every way new to me, I found the journey a most\ninteresting one.\n\nThe island of Mombasa is separated from the mainland by the Strait of\nMacupa, and the railway crosses this by a bridge about three-quarters\nof a mile long, called the Salisbury Bridge, in honour of the great\nMinister for Foreign Affairs under whose direction the Uganda Railway\nscheme was undertaken. For twenty miles after reaching the mainland,\nour train wound steadily upwards through beautifully wooded, park-like\ncountry, and on looking back out of the carriage windows we could every\nnow and again obtain lovely views of Mombasa and Kilindini, while\nbeyond these the Indian Ocean sparkled in the glorious sunshine as far\nas the eye could see. The summit of the Rabai Hills having been\nreached, we entered on the expanse of the Taru Desert, a wilderness\ncovered with poor scrub and stunted trees, and carpeted in the dry\nseason with a layer of fine red dust. This dust is of a most\npenetrating character, and finds its way into everything in the\ncarriage as the train passes along. From here onward game is more or\nless plentiful, but the animals are very difficult to see owing to the\nthick undergrowth in which they hide themselves. We managed, however,\nto catch sight of a few from the carriage windows, and also noticed\nsome of the natives, the Wa Nyika, or \"children of the wilderness.\"\n\nAt Maungu, some eighty miles from the coast, we came to the end of this\n\"desert,\" but almost the only difference to be noticed in the character\nof the country was that the colour of the dust had changed. As our\ntrain sped onwards through the level uplands we saw a fine ostrich\nstriding along parallel with the line, as if having a race with us. Dr.\nMcCulloch at once seized his rifle and by a lucky shot brought down the\nhuge bird; the next and greater difficulty, however, was to secure the\nprize. For a time the engine-driver took no notice of our signals and\nshouts, but at last we succeeded in attracting his attention, and the\ntrain was shunted back to where the ostrich had fallen. We found it to\nbe an exceptionally fine specimen, and had to exert all our strength to\ndrag it on board the train.\n\nSoon after this we reached Voi, about a hundred miles from the coast,\nand as this was the most important station on the line that we had yet\ncome to, we made a short halt in order to inspect some construction\nwork which was going on. On resuming our journey, we soon discovered\nthat a pleasant change had occurred in the character of the landscape.\nFrom a place called N'dii, the railway runs for some miles through a\nbeautifully wooded country, which looked all the more inviting after\nthe deadly monotony of the wilderness through which we had just passed.\nTo the south of us could be seen the N'dii range of mountains, the\ndwelling-place of the Wa Taita people, while on our right rose the\nrigid brow of the N'dungu Escarpment, which stretches away westwards\nfor scores of miles. Here our journey was slow, as every now and again\nwe stopped to inspect the permanent works in progress; but eventually,\ntowards dusk, we arrived at our destination, Tsavo. I slept that night\nin a little palm hut which had been built by some previous traveller,\nand which was fortunately unoccupied for the time being. It was rather\nbroken-down and dilapidated, not even possessing a door, and as I lay\non my narrow camp bed I could see the stars twinkling through the roof.\nI little knew then what adventures awaited me in this neighbourhood;\nand if I had realised that at that very time two savage brutes were\nprowling round, seeking whom they might devour, I hardly think I should\nhave slept so peacefully in my rickety shelter.\n\nNext morning I was up betimes, eager to make acquaintance with my new\nsurroundings. My first impression on coming out of my hut was that I\nwas hemmed in on all sides by a dense growth of impenetrable jungle:\nand on scrambling to the top of a little hill close at hand, I found\nthat the whole country as far as I could see was covered with low,\nstunted trees, thick undergrowth and \"wait-a-bit\" thorns. The only\nclearing, indeed, appeared to be where the narrow track for the railway\nhad been cut. This interminable nyika, or wilderness of whitish and\nleafless dwarf trees, presented a ghastly and sun-stricken appearance;\nand here and there a ridge of dark-red heat-blistered rock jutted out\nabove the jungle, and added by its rugged barrenness to the dreariness\nof the picture. Away to the north-east stretched the unbroken line of\nthe N'dungu Escarpment, while far off to the south I could just catch a\nglimpse of the snow-capped top of towering Kilima N'jaro. The one\nredeeming feature of the neighbourhood was the river from which Tsavo\ntakes its name. This is a swiftly-flowing stream, always cool and\nalways running, the latter being an exceptional attribute in this part\nof East Africa; and the fringe of lofty green trees along its banks\nformed a welcome relief to the general monotony of the landscape.\n\nWhen I had thus obtained a rough idea of the neighbourhood, I returned\nto my hut, and began in earnest to make preparations for my stay in\nthis out-of-the-way place. The stores were unpacked, and my \"boys\"\npitched my tent in a little clearing close to where I had slept the\nnight before and not far from the main camp of the workmen. Railhead\nhad at this time just reached the western side of the river, and some\nthousands of Indian coolies and other workmen were encamped there. As\nthe line had to be pushed on with all speed, a diversion had been made\nand the river crossed by means of a temporary bridge. My principal work\nwas to erect the permanent structure, and to complete all the other\nworks for a distance of thirty miles on each side of Tsavo. I\naccordingly made a survey of what had to be done, and sent my\nrequisition for labour, tools and material to the head-quarters at\nKilindini. In a short time workmen and supplies came pouring in, and\nthe noise of hammers and sledges, drilling and blasting echoed merrily\nthrough the district.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE MAN-EATERS\n\n\nUnfortunately this happy state of affairs did not continue for long,\nand our work was soon interrupted in a rude and startling manner. Two\nmost voracious and insatiable man-eating lions appeared upon the scene,\nand for over nine months waged an intermittent warfare against the\nrailway and all those connected with it in the vicinity of Tsavo. This\nculminated in a perfect reign of terror in December, 1898, when they\nactually succeeded in bringing the railway works to a complete\nstandstill for about three weeks. At first they were not always\nsuccessful in their efforts to carry off a victim, but as time went on\nthey stopped at nothing and indeed braved any danger in order to obtain\ntheir favourite food. Their methods then became so uncanny, and their\nman-stalking so well-timed and so certain of success, that the workmen\nfirmly believed that they were not real animals at all, but devils in\nlions' shape. Many a time the coolies solemnly assured me that it was\nabsolutely useless to attempt to shoot them. They were quite convinced\nthat the angry spirits of two departed native chiefs had taken this\nform in order to protest against a railway being made through their\ncountry, and by stopping its progress to avenge the insult thus shown\nto them.\n\nI had only been a few days at Tsavo when I first heard that these\nbrutes had been seen in the neighbourhood. Shortly afterwards one or\ntwo coolies mysteriously disappeared, and I was told that they had been\ncarried off by night from their tents and devoured by lions. At the\ntime I did not credit this story, and was more inclined to believe that\nthe unfortunate men had been the victims of foul play at the hands of\nsome of their comrades. They were, as it happened, very good workmen,\nand had each saved a fair number of rupees, so I thought it quite\nlikely that some scoundrels from the gangs had murdered them for the\nsake of their money. This suspicion, however, was very soon dispelled.\nAbout three weeks after my arrival, I was roused one morning about\ndaybreak and told that one of my jemadars, a fine powerful Sikh named\nUngan Singh, had been seized in his tent during the night, and dragged\noff and eaten.\n\nNaturally I lost no time in making an examination of the place, and was\nsoon convinced that the man had indeed been carried off by a lion, as\nits \"pug\" marks were plainly visible in the sand, while the furrows\nmade by the heels of the victim showed the direction in which he had\nbeen dragged away. Moreover, the jemadar shared his tent with half a\ndozen other workmen, and one of his bedfellows had actually witnessed\nthe occurrence. He graphically described how, at about midnight, the\nlion suddenly put its head in at the open tent door and seized Ungan\nSingh--who happened to be nearest the opening--by the throat. The\nunfortunate fellow cried out \"Choro\" (\"Let go\"), and threw his arms up\nround the lion's neck. The next moment he was gone, and his\npanic-stricken companions lay helpless, forced to listen to the\nterrible struggle which took place outside. Poor Ungan Singh must have\ndied hard; but what chance had he? As a coolie gravely remarked, \"Was\nhe not fighting with a lion?\"\n\nOn hearing this dreadful story I at once set out to try to track the\nanimal, and was accompanied by Captain Haslem, who happened to be\nstaying at Tsavo at the time, and who, poor fellow, himself met with a\ntragic fate very shortly afterwards. We found it an easy matter to\nfollow the route taken by the lion, as he appeared to have stopped\nseveral times before beginning his meal. Pools of blood marked these\nhalting-places, where he doubtless indulged in the man-eaters' habit of\nlicking the skin off so as to get at the fresh blood. (I have been led\nto believe that this is their custom from the appearance of two\nhalf-eaten bodies which I subsequently rescued: the skin was gone in\nplaces, and the flesh looked dry, as if it had been sucked.) On\nreaching the spot where the body had been devoured, a dreadful\nspectacle presented itself. The ground all round was covered with blood\nand morsels of flesh and bones, but the unfortunate jemadar's head had\nbeen left intact, save for the holes made by the lion's tusks on\nseizing him, and lay a short distance away from the other remains, the\neyes staring wide open with a startled, horrified look in them. The\nplace was considerably cut up, and on closer examination we found that\ntwo lions had been there and had probably struggled for possession of\nthe body. It was the most gruesome sight I had ever seen. We collected\nthe remains as well as we could and heaped stones on them, the head\nwith its fixed, terrified stare seeming to watch us all the time, for\nit we did not bury, but took back to camp for identification before the\nMedical Officer.\n\nThus occurred my first experience of man-eating lions, and I vowed\nthere and then that I would spare no pains to rid the neighbourhood of\nthe brutes. I little knew the trouble that was in store for me, or how\nnarrow were to be my own escapes from sharing poor Ungan Singh's fate.\n\nThat same night I sat up in a tree close to the late jemadar's tent,\nhoping that the lions would return to it for another victim. I was\nfollowed to my perch by a few of the more terrified coolies, who begged\nto be allowed to sit up in the tree with me; all the other workmen\nremained in their tents, but no more doors were left open. I had with\nme my .303 and a 12-bore shot gun, one barrel loaded with ball and the\nother with slug. Shortly after settling down to my vigil, my hopes of\nbagging one of the brutes were raised by the sound of their ominous\nroaring coming closer and closer. Presently this ceased, and quiet\nreigned for an hour or two, as lions always stalk their prey in\ncomplete silence. All at once, however, we heard a great uproar and\nfrenzied cries coming from another camp about half a mile away; we knew\nthen that the lions had seized a victim there, and that we should see\nor hear nothing further of them that night.\n\nNext morning I found that one of the brutes had broken into a tent at\nRailhead Camp--whence we had heard the commotion during the night--and\nhad made off with a poor wretch who was lying there asleep. After a\nnight's rest, therefore, I took up my position in a suitable tree near\nthis tent. I did not at all like the idea of walking the half-mile to\nthe place after dark, but all the same I felt fairly safe, as one of my\nmen carried a bright lamp close behind me. He in his turn was followed\nby another leading a goat, which I tied under my tree in the hope that\nthe lion might be tempted to seize it instead of a coolie. A steady\ndrizzle commenced shortly after I had settled down to my night of\nwatching, and I was soon thoroughly chilled and wet. I stuck to my\nuncomfortable post, however, hoping to get a shot, but I well remember\nthe feeling of impotent disappointment I experienced when about\nmidnight I heard screams and cries and a heart-rending shriek, which\ntold me that the man-eaters had again eluded me and had claimed another\nvictim elsewhere.\n\nAt this time the various camps for the workmen were very scattered, so\nthat the lions had a range of some eight miles on either side of Tsavo\nto work upon; and as their tactics seemed to be to break into a\ndifferent camp each night, it was most difficult to forestall them.\nThey almost appeared, too, to have an extraordinary and uncanny faculty\nof finding out our plans beforehand, so that no matter in how likely or\nhow tempting a spot we lay in wait for them, they invariably avoided\nthat particular place and seized their victim for the night from some\nother camp. Hunting them by day, moreover, in such a dense wilderness\nas surrounded us, was an exceedingly tiring and really foolhardy\nundertaking. In a thick jungle of the kind round Tsavo the hunted\nanimal has every chance against the hunter, as however careful the\nlatter may be, a dead twig or something of the sort is sure to crackle\njust at the critical moment and so give the alarm. Still I never gave\nup hope of some day finding their lair, and accordingly continued to\ndevote all my spare time to crawling about through the undergrowth.\nMany a time when attempting to force my way through this bewildering\ntangle I had to be released by my gun-bearer from the fast clutches of\nthe \"wait-a-bit\"; and often with immense pains I succeeded in tracing\nthe lions to the river after they had seized a victim, only to lose the\ntrail from there onwards, owing to the rocky nature of the ground which\nthey seemed to be careful to choose in retreating to their den.\n\nAt this early stage of the struggle, I am glad to say, the lions were\nnot always successful in their efforts to capture a human being for\ntheir nightly meal, and one or two amusing incidents occurred to\nrelieve the tension from which our nerves were beginning to suffer. On\none occasion an enterprising bunniah (Indian trader) was riding along\non his donkey late one night, when suddenly a lion sprang out on him\nknocking over both man and beast. The donkey was badly wounded, and the\nlion was just about to seize the trader, when in some way or other his\nclaws became entangled in a rope by which two empty oil tins were\nstrung across the donkey's neck. The rattle and clatter made by these\nas he dragged them after him gave him such a fright that he turned tail\nand bolted off into the jungle, to the intense relief of the terrified\nbunniah, who quickly made his way up the nearest tree and remained\nthere, shivering with fear, for the rest of the night.\n\nShortly after this episode, a Greek contractor named Themistocles\nPappadimitrini had an equally marvellous escape. He was sleeping\npeacefully in his tent one night, when a lion broke in, and seized and\nmade off with the mattress on which he was lying. Though, rudely\nawakened, the Greek was quite unhurt and suffered from nothing worse\nthan a bad fright. This same man, however, met with a melancholy fate\nnot long afterwards. He had been to the Kilima N'jaro district to buy\ncattle, and on the return journey attempted to take a short cut across\ncountry to the railway, but perished miserably of thirst on the way.\n\nOn another occasion fourteen coolies who slept together in a large tent\nwere one night awakened by a lion suddenly jumping on to the tent and\nbreaking through it. The brute landed with one claw on a coolie's\nshoulder, which was badly torn; but instead of seizing the man himself,\nin his hurry he grabbed a large bag of rice which happened to be lying\nin the tent, and made off with it, dropping it in disgust some little\ndistance away when he realised his mistake.\n\nThese, however, were only the earlier efforts of the man-eaters. Later\non, as will be seen, nothing flurried or frightened them in the least,\nand except as food they showed a complete contempt for human beings.\nHaving once marked down a victim, they would allow nothing to deter\nthem from securing him, whether he were protected by a thick fence, or\ninside a closed tent, or sitting round a brightly burning fire. Shots,\nshouting and firebrands they alike held in derision.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE ATTACK ON THE GOODS-WAGON\n\n\nAll this time my own tent was pitched in an open clearing, unprotected\nby a fence of any kind round it. One night when the medical officer;\nDr. Rose, was staying with me, we were awakened about midnight by\nhearing something tumbling about among the tent ropes, but on going out\nwith a lantern we could discover nothing. Daylight, however, plainly\nrevealed the \"pug\" marks of a lion, so that on that occasion I fancy\none or other of us had a narrow escape. Warned by this experience, I at\nonce arranged to move my quarters, and went to join forces with Dr.\nBrock, who had just arrived at Tsavo to take medical charge of the\ndistrict. We shared a hut of palm leaves and boughs, which we had\nconstructed on the eastern side of the river, close to the old caravan\nroute leading to Uganda; and we had it surrounded by a circular boma,\nor thorn fence, about seventy yards in diameter, well made and thick\nand high. Our personal servants also lived within the enclosure, and a\nbright fire was always kept up throughout the night. For the sake of\ncoolness, Brock and I used to sit out under the verandah of this hut in\nthe evenings; but it was rather trying to our nerves to attempt to read\nor write there, as we never knew when a lion might spring over the\nboma, and be on us before we were aware. We therefore kept our rifles\nwithin easy reach, and cast many an anxious glance out into the inky\ndarkness beyond the circle of the firelight. On one or two occasions,\nwe found in the morning that the lions had come quite close to the\nfence; but fortunately they never succeeded in getting through.\n\nBy this time, too, the camps of the workmen had also been surrounded by\nthorn fences; nevertheless the lions managed to jump over or to break\nthrough some one or other of these, and regularly every few nights a\nman was carried off, the reports of the disappearance of this or that\nworkman coming in to me with painful frequency. So long, however, as\nRailhead Camp--with its two or three thousand men, scattered over a\nwide area--remained at Tsavo, the coolies appeared not to take much\nnotice of the dreadful deaths of their comrades. Each man felt, I\nsuppose, that as the man-eaters had such a large number of victims to\nchoose from, the chances of their selecting him in particular were very\nsmall. But when the large camp moved ahead with the railway, matters\naltered considerably. I was then left with only some few hundred men to\ncomplete the permanent works; and as all the remaining workmen were\nnaturally camped together, the attentions of the lions became more\napparent and made a deeper impression. A regular panic consequently\nensued, and it required all my powers of persuasion to induce the men\nto stay on. In fact, I succeeded in doing so only by allowing them to\nknock off all regular work until they had built exceptionally thick and\nhigh bomas round each camp. Within these enclosures fires were kept\nburning all night, and it was also the duty of the night-watchman to\nkeep clattering half a dozen empty oil tins suspended from a convenient\ntree. These he manipulated by means of a long rope, while sitting in\nsafety within his tent; and the frightful noise thus produced was kept\nup at frequent intervals during the night in the hopes of terrifying\naway the man-eaters. In spite of all these precautions, however, the\nlions would not be denied, and men continued to disappear.\n\nWhen the railhead workmen moved on, their hospital camp was left\nbehind. It stood rather apart from the other camps, in a clearing about\nthree-quarters of a mile from my hut, but was protected by a good thick\nfence and to all appearance was quite secure. It seemed, however, as if\nbarriers were of no avail against the \"demons\", for before very long\none of them found a weak spot in the boma and broke through. On this\noccasion the Hospital Assistant had a marvellous escape. Hearing a\nnoise outside, he opened the door of his tent and was horrified to see\na great lion standing a few yards away looking at him. The beast made a\nspring towards him, which gave the Assistant such a fright that he\njumped backwards, and in doing so luckily upset a box containing\nmedical stores. This crashed down with such a loud clatter of breaking\nglass that the lion was startled for the moment and made off to another\npart of the enclosure. Here, unfortunately, he was more successful, as\nhe jumped on to and broke through a tent in which eight patients were\nlying. Two of them were badly wounded by his spring, while a third poor\nwretch was seized and dragged off bodily through the thorn fence. The\ntwo wounded coolies were left where they lay, a piece of torn tent\nhaving fallen over them; and in this position the doctor and I found\nthem on our arrival soon after dawn next morning. We at once decided to\nmove the hospital closer to the main camp; a fresh site was prepared, a\nstout hedge built round the enclosure, and all the patients were moved\nin before nightfall.\n\nAs I had heard that lions generally visit recently deserted camps, I\ndecided to sit up all night in the vacated boma in the hope of getting\nan opportunity of bagging one of them; but in the middle of my lonely\nvigil I had the mortification of hearing shrieks and cries coming from\nthe direction of the new hospital, telling me only too plainly that our\ndreaded foes had once more eluded me. Hurrying to the place at daylight\nI found that one of the lions had jumped over the newly erected fence\nand had carried off the hospital bhisti (water-carrier), and that\nseveral other coolies had been unwilling witnesses of the terrible\nscene which took place within the circle of light given by the big camp\nfire. The bhisti, it appears, had been lying on the floor, with his\nhead towards the centre of the tent and his feet neatly touching the\nside. The lion managed to get its head in below the canvas, seized him\nby the foot and pulled him out. In desperation the unfortunate\nwater-carrier clutched hold of a heavy box in a vain attempt to prevent\nhimself being carried off, and dragged it with him until he was forced\nto let go by its being stopped by the side of the tent. He then caught\nhold of a tent rope, and clung tightly to it until it broke. As soon as\nthe lion managed to get him clear of the tent, he sprang at his throat\nand after a few vicious shakes the poor bhisti's agonising cries were\nsilenced for ever. The brute then seized him in his mouth, like a huge\ncat with a mouse, and ran up and down the boma looking for a weak spot\nto break through. This he presently found and plunged into, dragging\nhis victim with him and leaving shreds of torn cloth and flesh as\nghastly evidences of his passage through the thorns. Dr. Brock and I\nwere easily able to follow his track, and soon found the remains about\nfour hundred yards away in the bush. There was the usual horrible\nsight. Very little was left of the unfortunate bhisti--only the skull,\nthe jaws, a few of the larger bones and a portion of the palm with one\nor two fingers attached. On one of these was a silver ring, and this,\nwith the teeth (a relic much prized by certain castes), was sent to the\nman's widow in India.\n\nAgain it was decided to move the hospital; and again, before nightfall,\nthe work was completed, including a still stronger and thicker boma.\nWhen the patients had been moved, I had a covered goods-wagon placed in\na favourable position on a siding which ran close to the site which had\njust been abandoned, and in this Brock and I arranged to sit up that\nnight. We left a couple of tents still standing within the enclosure,\nand also tied up a few cattle in it as bait for the lions, who had been\nseen in no less than three different places in the neighbourhood during\nthe afternoon (April 23). Four miles from Tsavo they had attempted to\nseize a coolie who was walking along the line. Fortunately, however, he\nhad just time to escape up a tree, where he remained, more dead than\nalive, until he was rescued by the Traffic Manager, who caught sight of\nhim from a passing train. They next appeared close to Tsavo Station,\nand a couple of hours later some workmen saw one of the lions stalking\nDr. Brock as he was returning about dusk from the hospital.\n\nIn accordance with our plan, the doctor and I set out after dinner for\nthe goods-wagon, which was about a mile away from our hut. In the light\nof subsequent events, we did a very foolish thing in taking up our\nposition so late; nevertheless, we reached our destination in safety,\nand settled down to our watch about ten o'clock. We had the lower half\nof the door of the wagon closed, while the upper half was left wide\nopen for observation: and we faced, of course, in the direction of the\nabandoned boma, which, however, we were unable to see in the inky\ndarkness. For an hour or two everything was quiet, and the deadly\nsilence was becoming very monotonous and oppressive, when suddenly, to\nour right, a dry twig snapped, and we knew that an animal of some sort\nwas about. Soon afterwards we heard a dull thud, as if some heavy body\nhad jumped over the boma. The cattle, too, became very uneasy, and we\ncould hear them moving about restlessly. Then again came dead silence.\nAt this juncture I proposed to my companion that I should get out of\nthe wagon and lie on the ground close to it, as I could see better in\nthat position should the lion come in our direction with his prey.\nBrock, however, persuaded me to remain where I was; and a few seconds\nafterwards I was heartily glad that I had taken his advice, for at that\nvery moment one of the man-eaters--although we did not know it--was\nquietly stalking us, and was even then almost within springing\ndistance. Orders had been given for the entrance to the boma to be\nblocked up, and accordingly we were listening in the expectation of\nhearing the lion force his way out through the bushes with his prey. As\na matter of fact, however, the doorway had not been properly closed,\nand while we were wondering what the lion could be doing inside the\nboma for so long, he was outside all the time, silently reconnoitring\nour position.\n\nPresently I fancied I saw something coming very stealthily towards us.\nI feared, however, to trust to my eyes, which by that time were\nstrained by prolonged staring through the darkness, so under my breath\nI asked Brock whether he saw anything, at the same time covering the\ndark object as well as I could with my rifle. Brock did not answer; he\ntold me afterwards that he, too, thought he had seen something move,\nbut was afraid to say so lest I should fire and it turn out to be\nnothing after all. After this there was intense silence again for a\nsecond or two, then with a sudden bound a huge body sprang at us. \"The\nlion!\" I shouted, and we both fired almost simultaneously--not a moment\ntoo soon, for in another second the brute would assuredly have landed\ninside the wagon. As it was, he must have swerved off in his spring,\nprobably blinded by the flash and frightened by the noise of the double\nreport which was increased a hundredfold by the reverberation of the\nhollow iron roof of the truck. Had we not been very much on the alert,\nhe would undoubtedly have got one of us, and we realised that we had\nhad a very lucky and very narrow escape. The next morning we found\nBrock's bullet embedded in the sand close to a footprint; it could not\nhave missed the lion by more than an inch or two. Mine was nowhere to\nbe found.\n\nThus ended my first direct encounter with one of the man-eaters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE BUILDING OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE\n\n\nDuring all this troublesome period the construction of the railway had\nbeen going steadily forward, and the first important piece of work\nwhich I had commenced on arrival was completed. This was the widening\nof a rock cutting through which the railway ran just before it, reached\nthe river. In the hurry of pushing on the laying of the line, just\nenough of the rock had originally been cut away to allow room for an\nengine to pass, and consequently any material which happened to,\nproject outside the wagons or trucks caught on the jagged faces of the\ncutting. I myself saw the door of a guard's van, which had been left\najar, smashed to atoms in this way; and accordingly I put a gang of\nrock-drillers to work at once and soon had ample room made for all\ntraffic to pass unimpeded. While this was going on, another gang of men\nwere laying the foundations of a girder bridge which was to span a\ngully between this cutting and Tsavo Station. This would have taken too\nlong to erect when railhead was at the place, so a diversion had been\nmade round it, the temporary track leading down almost to the bed of\nthe nullah and up again on the further side. When the foundations and\nabutments were ready, the gully was spanned by an iron girder, the\nslopes leading up to it banked up on either side, and the permanent way\nlaid on an easy grade.\n\nThen, also, a water supply had to be established; and this meant some\nvery pleasant work for me in taking levels up the banks of the river\nunder the cool shade of the palms. While doing this, I often took my\ncamp-kit with me, and a luncheon served in the wilds, with occasionally\na friend to share it--when a friend was available--was delightful. On\none occasion in particular, I went a long way up the river and was\naccompanied by a young member of my staff. The day had been exceedingly\nhot and we were both correspondingly tired when our work was finished,\nso my companion suggested that we should build a raft and float\ndown-stream home. I was rather doubtful, of the feasibility of the\nscheme, but nevertheless he decided to give it a trial. Setting to work\nwith our axes, we soon had a raft built, lashing the poles together\nwith the fibre which grows in abundance all over the district. When it\nwas finished, we pushed it out of the little backwater where it had\nbeen constructed, and the young engineer jumped aboard. All went well\nuntil it got out into midstream, when much to my amusement it promptly\ntoppled gracefully over. I helped my friend to scramble quickly up the\nbank out of reach of possible crocodiles, when, none the worse for his\nducking, he laughed as heartily as I at the adventure.\n\nExcept for an occasional relaxation of this sort, every moment of my\ntime was fully occupied. Superintending the various works and a hundred\nother duties kept me busy all day long, while my evenings were given up\nto settling disputes among the coolies, hearing reports and complaints\nfrom the various jemadars and workpeople, and in studying the Swahili\nlanguage. Preparations, too, for the principal piece of work in the\ndistrict--the building of the railway bridge over the Tsavo river--were\ngoing on apace. These involved, much personal work on my part; cross\nand oblique sections of the river had to be taken, the rate of the\ncurrent and the volume of water at flood, mean, and low levels had to\nbe found, and all the necessary calculations made. These having at\nlength been completed, I marked out the positions for the abutments and\npiers, and the work of sinking their foundations was begun. The two\ncentre piers in particular caused a great deal of trouble, as the river\nbroke in several times, and had to be dammed up and pumped dry again\nbefore work could be resumed. Then we found we had to sink much deeper\nthan we expected in order to reach a solid foundation indeed, the\nsinking went on and on, until I began to despair of finding one and was\nabout to resort to pile-driving, when at last, to my relief, we struck\nsolid rock on which the huge foundation-stones could be laid with\nperfect safety.\n\nAnother great difficulty with which we had to contend was the absence\nof suitable stone in the neighbourhood. It was not that there was none\nto be found, for the whole district abounds in rock, but that it was so\nintensely hard as to be almost impossible to work, and a bridge built\nof it would have been very costly. I spent many a weary day trudging\nthrough the thorny wilderness vainly searching for suitable material,\nand was beginning to think that we should be forced to use iron columns\nfor the piers, when one day I stumbled quite by accident on the very\nthing. Brock and I were out \"pot-hunting,\" and hearing some guinea-fowl\ncackling among the bushes, I made a circuit half round them so that\nBrock, on getting in his shot, should drive them over in my direction.\nI eventually got into position on the edge of a deep ravine and knelt\non one knee, crouching down among the ferns. There I had scarcely time\nto load when over flew a bird, which I missed badly; and I did not have\nanother chance, for Brock had got to work, and being a first-rate shot\nhad quickly bagged a brace. Meanwhile I felt the ground very hard under\nmy knee, and on examination found that the bank of the ravine was\nformed of stone, which extended for some distance, and which was\nexactly the kind of material for which I had long been fruitlessly\nsearching. I was greatly delighted with my unexpected discovery, though\nat first I had grave misgivings about the distance to be traversed and\nthe difficulty of transporting the stone across the intervening\ncountry. Indeed, I found in the end that the only way of getting the\nmaterial to the place where it was wanted was by laying down a tram\nline right along the ravine, throwing a temporary bridge across the\nTsavo, following the stream down and re-crossing it again close to the\nsite of the permanent bridge. Accordingly, I set men to work at once to\ncut down the jungle and prepare a road on which to lay the double\ntrolley line. One morning when they were thus engaged, a little paa--a\nkind of very small antelope--sprang out and found itself suddenly in\nthe midst of a gang of coolies. Terrified and confused by the shouting\nof the men, it ran straight at Shere Shah, the jemadar, who promptly\ndropped a basket over it and held it fast. I happened to arrive just in\ntime to save the graceful little animal's life, and took it home to my\ncamp, where it very soon became a great pet. Indeed, it grew so tame\nthat it would jump upon my table at meal times and eat from my hand.\n\nWhen the road for the trolley line was cleared, the next piece of work\nwas the building of the two temporary bridges over the river. These we\nmade in the roughest fashion out of palm trees and logs felled at the\ncrossing places, and had a flood come down they would, of course, have\nboth been swept away; fortunately, however, this did not occur until\nthe permanent work was completed. The whole of this feeding line was\nfinished in a very short time, and trollies were soon plying backwards\nand forwards with loads of stone and sand, as we also discovered the\nlatter in abundance and of good quality in the bed of the ravine. An\namusing incident occurred one day when I was taking a photograph of an\nenormous block of stone which was being hauled across one of these\ntemporary bridges. As the trolley with its heavy load required very\ncareful manipulation, my head mason, Heera Singh, stood on the top of\nthe stone to direct operations, while the overseer, Purshotam Hurjee,\nsuperintended the gangs of men who hauled the ropes at either end in\norder to steady it up and down the inclines. But we did not know that\nthe stream had succeeded in washing away the foundations of one of the\nlog supports; and as the weight of the trolley with the stone came on\nthe undermined pier, the rails tilted up and over went the whole thing\ninto the river, just as I snapped the picture. Heera Singh made a wild\nspring into the water to get clear of the falling stone, while\nPurshotam and the rest fled as if for their lives to the bank. It was\naltogether a most comical sight, and an extraordinary chance that at\nthe very moment of the accident I should be taking a photograph of the\noperation. Fortunately, no one was injured in the slightest, and the\nstone was recovered undamaged with but little trouble.\n\nNot long after this occurrence my own labours were one day nearly\nbrought to a sudden and unpleasant end. I was travelling along in an\nempty trolley which, pushed by two sturdy Pathans, was returning to the\nquarry for sand. Presently we came to the sharp incline which led to\nthe log bridge over the river. Here it was the custom of the men,\ninstead of running beside the trolley, to step on to it and to let its\nown momentum take it down the slope, moderating its speed when\nnecessary by a brake in the shape of a pole, which one of them carried\nand by which the wheels could be locked. On this occasion, however, the\npole was by some accident dropped overboard, and down the hill we flew\nwithout brake of any kind. Near the bridge there was a sharp curve in\nthe line, where I was afraid the trolley would jump the rails; still, I\nthought it was better to stick to it than to risk leaping off. A moment\nafterwards I felt myself flying head first over the edge of the bridge,\njust missing by a hair's breadth a projecting beam; but luckily I\nlanded on a sand bank at the side of the river, the heavy trolley\nfalling clear of me with a dull thud close by. This accident, also, was\nhappily unattended by injury to anyone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTROUBLES WITH THE WORKMEN\n\n\nIt seemed fated that the building of the Tsavo Bridge should never be\nallowed to proceed in peace for any length of time. I have already\ndescribed our troubles with the lions; and no sooner did the beasts of\nprey appear to have deserted us, for the time being at any rate, than\nother troubles, no less serious, arose with the workmen themselves.\nAfter I had discovered the stone for the bridge, I sent down to the\ncoast for gangs of masons to work and dress it. The men who were sent\nme for this purpose were mostly Pathans and were supposed to be expert\nworkmen; but I soon found that many of them had not the faintest notion\nof stone-cutting, and were simply ordinary coolies who had posed as\nmasons in order to draw forty-five instead of twelve rupees a month. On\ndiscovering this fact, I immediately instituted a system of piecework,\nand drew up a scale of pay which would enable the genuine mason to earn\nhis forty-five rupees a month--and a little more if he felt\ninclined--and would cut down the impostors to about their proper pay as\ncoolies. Now, as is often the case in this world, the impostors were\ngreatly in the majority; and accordingly they attempted to intimidate\nthe remainder into coming down to their own standard as regards output\nof work, in the hope of thereby inducing me to abandon the piece-work\nsystem of payment. This, however, I had no intention of doing, as I\nknew that I had demanded only a perfectly fair amount of work from each\nman.\n\nThese masons were continually having quarrels and fights amongst\nthemselves, and I had frequently to go down to their camp to quell\ndisturbances and to separate the Hindus from the Mohammedans. One\nparticularly serious disturbance of this sort had a rather amusing\nsequel. I was sitting after dusk one evening at the door of my hut,\nwhen I heard a great commotion in the masons' camp, which lay only a\nfew hundred yards away. Presently a jemadar came rushing up to me to\nsay that the men were all fighting and murdering each other with sticks\nand stones. I ran back with him at once and succeeded in restoring\norder, but found seven badly injured men lying stretched out on the\nground. These I had carried up to my own boma on charpoys (native\nbeds); and Brock being away, I had to play the doctor myself as best I\ncould, stitching one and bandaging another and generally doing what was\npossible. There was one man, however, who groaned loudly and held a\ncloth over his face as if he were dying. On lifting this covering, I\nfound him to be a certain mason called Karim Bux, who was well known to\nme as a prime mischief-maker among the men. I examined him carefully,\nbut as I could discover nothing amiss, I concluded that he must have\nreceived some internal injury, and accordingly told him that I would\nsend him to the hospital at Voi (about thirty miles down the line) to\nbe attended to properly. He was then carried back to his camp, groaning\ngrievously all the time.\n\nScarcely had he been removed, when the head jemadar came and informed\nme that the man was not hurt at all, and that as a matter of fact he\nwas the sole cause of the disturbance. He was now pretending to be\nbadly injured, in order to escape the punishment which he knew he would\nreceive if I discovered that he was the instigator of the trouble. On\nhearing this, I gave instructions that he was not to go to Voi in the\nspecial train with the others; but I had not heard the last of him yet.\nAbout eleven o'clock that night I was called up and asked to go down to\nthe masons' camp to see a man who was supposed to be dying. I at once\npulled on my boots, got some brandy and ran down to the camp, where to\nmy surprise and amusement I found that it was my friend Karim Bux who\nwas at death's door. It was perfectly evident to me that he was only\n\"foxing,\" but when he asked for dawa (medicine), I told him gravely\nthat I would give him some very good dawa in the morning.\n\nNext day at noon--when it was my custom to have evil-doers brought up\nfor judgment--I asked for Karim Bux, but was told that he was too ill\nto walk. I accordingly ordered him to be carried to my boma, and in a\nfew moments he arrived in his charpoy, which was shouldered by four\ncoolies who, I could see, knew quite well that he was only shamming.\nThere were also a score or so of his friends hanging around, doubtless\nwaiting in the expectation of seeing the \"Sahib\" hoodwinked. When the\nbed was placed on the ground near me, I lifted the blanket with which\nhe had covered himself and thoroughly examined him, at the same time\nfeeling him to make sure that he had no fever. He pretended to be\ndesperately ill and again asked for dawa; but having finally satisfied\nmyself that it was as the jemadar had said--pure budmashi\n(devilment)--I told him that I was going to give him some very\neffective dawa, and carefully covered him up again, pulling the blanket\nover his head. I then got a big armful of shavings from a carpenter's\nbench which was close by, put them under the bed and set fire to them.\nAs soon as the sham invalid felt the heat, he peeped over the edge of\nthe blanket; and when he saw the smoke and flame leaping up round him,\nhe threw the blanket from him, sprang from the bed exclaiming \"Beiman\nshaitan!\" (\"Unbelieving devil!\"), and fled like a deer to the entrance\nof my boma, pursued by a Sikh sepoy, who got in a couple of good whacks\non his shoulders with a stout stick before he effected his escape. His\namused comrades greeted me with shouts of \"Shabash, Sahib!\" (\"Well\ndone, sir\"), and I never had any further trouble with Karim Bux. He\ncame back later in the day, with clasped hands imploring forgiveness,\nwhich I readily granted, as he was a clever workman.\n\nA few days after this incident I was returning home one morning from a\ntree in which I had been keeping watch for the man-eaters during the\nprevious night. Coming unexpectedly on the quarry, I was amazed to find\ndead silence reigning and my rascals of workmen all stretched out in\nthe shade under the trees taking it very easy--some sleeping, some\nplaying cards. I watched their proceedings through the bushes for a\nlittle while, and then it occurred to me to give them a fright by\nfiring my rifle over their heads. On the report being heard, the scene\nchanged like magic: each man simply flew to his particular work, and\nhammers and chisels resounded merrily and energetically, where all had\nbeen silence a moment before. They thought, of course, that I was still\nsome distance off and had not seen them, but to their consternation I\nshouted to them that they were too late, as I had been watching them\nfor some time. I fined every man present heavily, besides summarily\ndegrading the Headman, who had thus shown himself utterly unfit for his\nposition. I then proceeded to my hut, but had scarcely arrived there\nwhen two of the scoundrels tottered up after me, bent almost double and\ncalling Heaven to witness that I had shot them both in the back. In\norder to give a semblance of truth to an otherwise bald and\nunconvincing narrative, they had actually induced one of their fellow\nworkmen to make a few holes like shot holes in their backs, and these\nwere bleeding profusely. Unfortunately for them, however, I had been\ncarrying a rifle and not a shot gun, and they had also forgotten to\nmake corresponding holes in their clothing, so that all they achieved\nby this elaborate tissue of falsehood was to bring on themselves the\nderision of their comrades and the imposition of an extra fine.\n\nShortly after this, when the masons realised that I intended to make\neach man do a fair day's work for his money, and would allow nothing to\nprevent this intention from being carried out, they came to the\nconclusion that the best thing to do would be to put me quietly out of\nthe way. Accordingly they held a meeting one night, all being sworn to\nsecrecy, and after a long palaver it was arranged that I was to be\nmurdered next day when I made my usual visit to the quarry. My body was\nto be thrown into the jungle, where of course it would soon be devoured\nby wild beasts, and then they were to say that I had been killed and\neaten by a lion. To this cheerful proposal every man present at the\nmeeting agreed, and affixed his finger-mark to a long strip of paper as\na binding token. Within an hour after the meeting had dispersed,\nhowever, I was aroused by one of the conspirators, who had crept into\nmy camp to give me warning. I thanked him for his information, but\ndetermined to go to the quarry in the morning all the same, as at this\nstage of affairs I really did not believe that they were capable of\ncarrying out such a diabolical scheme, and was rather inclined to think\nthat the informant had been sent merely to frighten me.\n\nAccordingly the next morning (September 6) I started off as usual along\nthe trolley line to the lonely quarry. As I reached a bend in the line,\nmy head mason, Heera Singh, a very good man, crept cautiously out of\nthe bushes and warned me not to proceed. On my asking him the reason,\nhe said that he dared not tell, but that he and twenty other masons\nwere not going to work that day, as they were afraid of trouble at the\nquarry. At this I began to think that there was something in the story\nI had heard overnight, but I laughingly assured him there would be no\ntrouble and continued on my way. On my arrival at the quarry,\neverything seemed perfectly peaceful. All the men were working away\nbusily, but after a moment or two I noticed stealthy side glances, and\nfelt that there was something in the wind. As soon as I came up to the\nfirst gang of workmen, the jemadar, a treacherous-looking villain,\ninformed me that the men working further up the ravine had refused to\nobey his orders, and asked me if I would go and see them. I felt at\nonce that this was a device to lure me into the narrow part of the\nravine, where, with gangs in front of me and behind me, there would be\nno escape; still I thought I would see the adventure through, whatever\ncame of it, so I accompanied the jemadar up the gully. When we got to\nthe further gang, he went so far as to point out the two men who, he\nsaid, had refused to do what he told them--I suppose he thought that as\nI was never to leave the place alive, it did not matter whom he\ncomplained of. I noted their names in my pocket-book in my usual\nmanner, and turned to retrace my steps. Immediately a yell of rage was\nraised by the whole body of some sixty men, answered by a similar shout\nfrom those I had first passed, and who numbered about a hundred. Both\ngroups of men, carrying crowbars and flourishing their heavy hammers,\nthen closed in on me in the narrow part of the ravine. I stood still,\nwaiting for them to act, and one man rushed at me, seizing both my\nwrists and shouting out that he was going to \"be hung and shot for\nme\"--rather a curious way of putting it, but that was his exact\nexpression. I easily wrenched my arms free, and threw him from me; but\nby this time I was closely hemmed in, and everywhere I looked I could\nsee nothing but evil and murderous-looking faces. One burly brute,\nafraid to be the first to deal a blow, hurled the man next him at me;\nand if he had succeeded in knocking me down, I am certain that I should\nnever have got up again alive. As it was, however, I stepped quickly\naside, and the man intended to knock me down was himself thrown\nviolently against a rock, over which he fell heavily.\n\nThis occasioned a moment's confusion, of which I quickly took\nadvantage. I sprang on to the top of the rock, and before they had time\nto recover themselves I had started haranguing them in Hindustani. The\nhabit of obedience still held them, and fortunately they listened to\nwhat I had to say. I told them that I knew all about their plot to\nmurder me, and that they could certainly do so if they wished; but that\nif they did, many of them would assuredly be hanged for it, as the\nSirkar (Government) would soon find out the truth and would disbelieve\ntheir story that I had been carried off by a lion. I said that I knew\nquite well that it was only one or two scoundrels among them who had\ninduced them to behave so stupidly, and urged them not to allow\nthemselves to be made fools of in this way. Even supposing they were to\ncarry out their plan of killing me, would not another \"Sahib\" at once\nbe set over them, and might he not be an even harder task-master? They\nall knew that I was just and fair to the real worker; it was only the\nscoundrels and shirkers who had anything to fear from me, and were\nupright, self-respecting. Pathans going to allow themselves to be led\naway by men of that kind? Once having got them to listen to me, I felt\na little more secure, and I accordingly went on to say that the\ndiscontented among them would be allowed to return at once to Mombasa,\nwhile if the others resumed work and I heard of no further plotting, I\nwould take no notice of their foolish conduct. Finally I called upon\nthose who were willing to return to work to hold up their hands, and\ninstantly every hand in the crowd was raised. I then felt that for the\nmoment the victory was mine, and after dismissing them, I jumped down\nfrom the rock and continued my rounds as if nothing had happened,\nmeasuring a stone here and there and commenting on the work done. They\nwere still in a very uncertain and sullen mood, however, and not at all\nto be relied upon, so it was with feelings of great relief that an hour\nlater I made my way back, safe and sound, to Tsavo.\n\nThe danger was not yet past, unfortunately, for scarcely had I turned\nmy back to go home when the mutiny broke out again, another meeting\nbeing held, and a fresh plot made to murder me during the night. Of\nthis I was soon informed by my time-keeper, who also told me that he\nwas afraid to go out and call the roll, as they had threatened to kill\nhim also. At this further outrage I lost no time in telegraphing for\nthe Railway Police, and also to the District Officer, Mr. Whitehead,\nwho immediately marched his men twenty-five miles by road to my\nassistance. I have no doubt, indeed, that his prompt action alone saved\nme from being attacked that very night. Two or three days afterwards\nthe Railway Police arrived and arrested the ringleaders in the mutiny,\nwho were taken to Mombasa and tried before Mr. Crawford, the British\nConsul, when the full details of the plots to murder me were unfolded\nby one of them who turned Queen's evidence. All the scoundrels were\nfound guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment in the\nchain-gangs, and I was never again troubled with mutinous workmen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE REIGN OF TERROR\n\n\nThe lions seemed to have got a bad fright the night Brock and I sat up\nin wait for them in the goods-wagon, for they kept away from Tsavo and\ndid not molest us in any way for some considerable time--not, in fact,\nuntil long after Brock had left me and gone on safari (a caravan\njourney) to Uganda. In this breathing space which they vouchsafed us,\nit occurred to me that should they renew their attacks, a trap would\nperhaps offer the best chance of getting at them, and that if I could\nconstruct one in which a couple of coolies might be used as bait\nwithout being subjected to any danger, the lions would be quite daring\nenough to enter it in search of them and thus be caught. I accordingly\nset to work at once, and in a short time managed to make a sufficiently\nstrong trap out of wooden sleepers, tram-rails, pieces of telegraph\nwire, and a length of heavy chain. It was divided into two\ncompartments--one for the men and one for the lion. A sliding door at\none end admitted the former, and once inside this compartment they were\nperfectly safe, as between them and the lion, if he entered the other,\nran a cross wall of iron rails only three inches apart, and embedded\nboth top and bottom in heavy wooden sleepers. The door which was to\nadmit the lion was, of course, at the opposite end of the structure,\nbut otherwise the whole thing was very much on the principle of the\nordinary rat-trap, except that it was not necessary for the lion to\nseize the bait in order to send the door clattering down. This part of\nthe contrivance was arranged in the following manner. A heavy chain was\nsecured along the top part of the lion's doorway, the ends hanging down\nto the ground on either side of the opening; and to these were\nfastened, strongly secured by stout wire, short lengths of rails placed\nabout six inches apart. This made a sort of flexible door which could\nbe packed into a small space when not in use, and which abutted against\nthe top of the doorway when lifted up. The door was held in this\nposition by a lever made of a piece of rail, which in turn was kept in\nits place by a wire fastened to one end and passing down to a spring\nconcealed in the ground inside the cage. As soon as the lion entered\nsufficiently far into the trap, he would be bound to tread on the\nspring; his weight on this would release the wire, and in an instant\ndown would come the door behind him; and he could not push it out in\nany way, as it fell into a groove between two rails firmly embedded in\nthe ground.\n\nIn making this trap, which cost us a lot of work, we were rather at a\nloss for want of tools to bore holes in the rails for the doorway, so\nas to enable them to be fastened by the wire to the chain. It occurred\nto me, however, that a hard-nosed bullet from my .303 would penetrate\nthe iron, and on making the experiment I was glad to find that a hole\nwas made as cleanly as if it had been punched out.\n\nWhen the trap was ready I pitched a tent over it in order further to\ndeceive the lions, and built an exceedingly strong boma round it. One\nsmall entrance was made at the back of the enclosure for the men, which\nthey were to close on going in by pulling a bush after them; and\nanother entrance just in front of the door of the cage was left open\nfor the lions. The wiseacres to whom I showed my invention were\ngenerally of the opinion that the man-eaters would be too cunning to\nwalk into my parlour; but, as will be seen later, their predictions\nproved false. For the first few nights I baited the trap myself, but\nnothing happened except that I had a very sleepless and uncomfortable\ntime, and was badly bitten by mosquitoes.\n\nAs a matter of fact, it was some months before the lions attacked us\nagain, though from time to time we heard of their depredations in other\nquarters. Not long after our night in the goods-wagon, two men were\ncarried off from railhead, while another was taken from a place called\nEngomani, about ten miles away. Within a very short time, this latter\nplace was again visited by the brutes, two more men being seized, one\nof whom was killed and eaten, and the other so badly mauled that he\ndied within few days. As I have said, however, we at Tsavo enjoyed\ncomplete immunity from attack, and the coolies, believing that their\ndreaded foes had permanently deserted the district, resumed all their\nusual habits and occupations, and life in the camps returned to its\nnormal routine.\n\nAt last we were suddenly startled out of this feeling of security. One\ndark night the familiar terror-stricken cries and screams awoke the\ncamps, and we knew that the \"demons\" had returned and had commenced a\nnew list of victims. On this occasion a number of men had been sleeping\noutside their tents for the sake of coolness, thinking, of course, that\nthe lions had gone for good, when suddenly in the middle of the night\none of the brutes was discovered forcing its way through the boma. The\nalarm was at once given, and sticks, stones and firebrands were hurled\nin the direction of the intruder. All was of no avail, however, for the\nlion burst into the midst of the terrified group, seized an unfortunate\nwretch amid the cries and shrieks of his companions, and dragged him\noff through the thick thorn fence. He was joined outside by the second\nlion, and so daring had the two brutes become that they did not trouble\nto carry their victim any further away, but devoured him within thirty\nyards of the tent where he had been seized. Although several shots were\nfired in their direction by the jemadar of the gang to which the coolie\nbelonged, they took no notice of these and did not attempt to move\nuntil their horrible meal was finished. The few scattered fragments\nthat remained of the body I would not allow to be buried at once,\nhoping that the lions would return to the spot the following night; and\non the chance of this I took up my station at nightfall in a convenient\ntree. Nothing occurred to break the monotony of my watch, however,\nexcept that I had a visit from a hyena, and the next morning I learned\nthat the lions had attacked another camp about two miles from\nTsavo--for by this time the camps were again scattered, as I had works\nin progress all up and down the line. There the man-eaters had been\nsuccessful in obtaining a victim, whom, as in the previous instance,\nthey devoured quite close to the camp. How they forced their way\nthrough the bomas without making a noise was, and still is, a mystery\nto me; I should have thought that it was next to impossible for an\nanimal to get through at all. Yet they continually did so, and without\na sound being heard.\n\nAfter this occurrence, I sat up every night for over a week near likely\ncamps, but all in vain. Either the lions saw me and then went\nelsewhere, or else I was unlucky, for they took man after man from\ndifferent places without ever once giving me a chance of a shot at\nthem. This constant night watching was most dreary and fatiguing work,\nbut I felt that it was a duty that had to be undertaken, as the men\nnaturally looked to me for protection. In the whole of my life I have\nnever experienced anything more nerve-shaking than to hear the deep\nroars of these dreadful monsters growing gradually nearer and nearer,\nand to know that some one or other of us was doomed to be their victim\nbefore morning dawned. Once they reached the vicinity of the camps, the\nroars completely ceased, and we knew that they were stalking for their\nprey. Shouts would then pass from camp to camp, \"Khabar dar, bhaieon,\nshaitan ata\" (\"Beware, brothers, the devil is coming\"), but the warning\ncries would prove of no avail, and sooner or later agonising shrieks\nwould break the silence, and another man would be missing from\nroll-call next morning.\n\nI was naturally very disheartened at being foiled in this way night\nafter night, and was soon at my wits' end to know what to do; it seemed\nas if the lions were really \"devils\" after all and bore a charmed life.\nAs I have said before, tracking them through the jungle was a hopeless\ntask; but as something had to be done to keep up the men's spirits, I\nspent many a weary day crawling on my hands and knees through the dense\nundergrowth of the exasperating wilderness around us. As a matter of\nfact, if I had come up with the lions on any of these expeditions, it\nwas much more likely that they would have added me to their list of\nvictims than that I should have succeeded in killing either of them, as\neverything would have been in their favour. About this time, too, I had\nmany helpers, and several officers--civil, naval and military--came to\nTsavo from the coast and sat up night after night in order to get a\nshot at our daring foes. All of us, however, met with the same lack of\nsuccess, and the lions always seemed capable of avoiding the watchers,\nwhile succeeding, at the same time in obtaining a victim.\n\nI have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the\nbrutes seized a man from the railway station and brought him close to\nmy camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and\nthe sound of their dreadful purring filled the air and rang in my ears\nfor days afterwards. The terrible thing was to feel so helpless; it was\nuseless to attempt to go out, as of course the poor fellow was dead,\nand in addition it was so pitch dark as to make it impossible to see\nanything. Some half a dozen workmen, who lived in a small enclosure\nclose to mine, became so terrified on hearing the lions at their meal\nthat they shouted and implored me to allow them to come inside my boma.\nThis I willingly did, but soon afterwards I remembered that one man had\nbeen lying ill in their camp, and on making enquiry I found that they\nhad callously left him behind alone. I immediately took some men with\nme to bring him to my boma, but on entering his tent I saw by the light\nof the lantern that the poor fellow was beyond need of safety. He had\ndied of shock at being deserted by his companions.\n\nFrom this time matters gradually became worse and worse. Hitherto, as a\nrule, only one of the man-eaters had made the attack and had done the\nforaging, while the other waited outside in the bush; but now they\nbegan to change their tactics, entering the bomas together and each\nseizing a victim. In this way two Swahili porters were killed during\nthe last week of November, one being immediately carried off and\ndevoured. The other was heard moaning for a long time, and when his\nterrified companions at last summoned up sufficient courage to go to\nhis assistance, they found him stuck fast in the bushes of the boma,\nthrough which for once the lion had apparently been unable to drag him.\nHe was still alive when I saw him next morning, but so terribly mauled\nthat he died before he could be got to the hospital.\n\nWithin a few days of this the two brutes made a most ferocious attack\non the largest camp in the section, which for safety's sake was\nsituated within a stone's throw of Tsavo Station and close to a\nPermanent Way Inspector's iron hut. Suddenly in the dead of night the\ntwo man-eaters burst in among the terrified workmen, and even from my\nboma, some distance away, I could plainly hear the panic-stricken\nshrieking of the coolies. Then followed cries of \"They've taken him;\nthey've taken him,\" as the brutes carried off their unfortunate victim\nand began their horrible feast close beside the camp. The Inspector,\nMr. Dalgairns, fired over fifty shots in the direction in which he\nheard the lions, but they were not to be frightened and calmly lay\nthere until their meal was finished. After examining the spot in the\nmorning, we at once set out to follow the brutes, Mr. Dalgairns feeling\nconfident that he had wounded one of them, as there was a trail on the\nsand like that of the toes of a broken limb. After some careful\nstalking, we suddenly found ourselves in the vicinity of the lions, and\nwere greeted with ominous growlings. Cautiously advancing and pushing\nthe bushes aside, we saw in the gloom what we at first took to be a\nlion cub; closer inspection, however, showed it to be the remains of\nthe unfortunate coolie, which the man-eaters had evidently abandoned at\nour approach. The legs, one arm and half the body had been eaten, and\nit was the stiff fingers of the other arm trailing along the sand which\nhad left the marks we had taken to be the trail of a wounded lion. By\nthis time the beasts had retired far into the thick jungle where it was\nimpossible to follow them, so we had the remains of the coolie buried\nand once more returned home disappointed.\n\nNow the bravest men in the world, much less the ordinary Indian coolie,\nwill not stand constant terrors of this sort indefinitely. The whole\ndistrict was by this time thoroughly panic-stricken, and I was not at\nall surprised, therefore, to find on my return to camp that same\nafternoon (December 1) that the men had all struck work and were\nwaiting to speak to me. When I sent for them, they flocked to my boma\nin a body and stated that they would not remain at Tsavo any longer for\nanything or anybody; they had come from India on an agreement to work\nfor the Government, not to supply food for either lions or \"devils.\" No\nsooner had they delivered this ultimatum than a regular stampede took\nplace. Some hundreds of them stopped the first passing train by\nthrowing themselves on the rails in front of the engine, and then,\nswarming on to the trucks and throwing in their possessions anyhow,\nthey fled from the accursed spot.\n\nAfter this the railway works were completely stopped; and for the next\nthree weeks practically nothing was done but build \"lion-proof\" huts\nfor those workmen who had had sufficient courage to remain. It was a\nstrange and amusing sight to see these shelters perched on the top of\nwater-tanks, roofs and girders--anywhere for safety--while some even\nwent so far as to dig pits inside their tents, into which they\ndescended at night, covering the top over with heavy logs of wood.\nEvery good-sized tree in the camp had as many beds lashed on to it as\nits branches would bear--and sometimes more. I remember that one night\nwhen the camp was attacked, so many men swarmed on to one particular\ntree that down it came with a crash, hurling its terror-stricken load\nof shrieking coolies close to the very lions they were trying to avoid.\nFortunately for them, a victim had already been secured, and the brutes\nwere too busy devouring him to pay attention to anything else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE DISTRICT OFFICER'S NARROW ESCAPE\n\n\nSome little time before the flight of the workmen, I had written to Mr.\nWhitehead, the District Officer, asking him to come up and assist me in\nmy campaign against the lions, and to bring with him any of his askaris\n(native soldiers) that he could spare. He replied accepting the\ninvitation, and told me to expect him about dinner-time on December 2,\nwhich turned out to be the day after the exodus. His train was due at\nTsavo about six o'clock in the evening, so I sent my \"boy\" up to the\nstation to meet him and to help in carrying his baggage to the camp. In\na very short time, however, the \"boy\" rushed back trembling with\nterror, and informed me that there was no sign of the train or of the\nrailway staff, but that an enormous lion was standing on the station\nplatform. This extraordinary story I did not believe in the least, as\nby this time the coolies--never remarkable for bravery--were in such a\nstate of fright that if they caught sight of a hyena or a baboon, or\neven a dog, in the bush, they were sure to imagine it was a lion; but I\nfound out next day that it was an actual fact, and that both\nstationmaster and signalman had been obliged to take refuge from one of\nthe man-eaters by locking themselves in the station building.\n\nI waited some little time for Mr. Whitehead, but eventually, as he did\nnot put in an appearance, I concluded that he must have postponed his\njourney until the next day, and so had my dinner in my customary\nsolitary state. During the meal I heard a couple of shots, but paid no\nattention to them, as rifles were constantly being fired off in the\nneighbourhood of the camp. Later in the evening, I went out as usual to\nwatch for our elusive foes, and took up my position in a crib made of\nsleepers which I had built on a big girder close to a camp which I\nthought was likely to be attacked. Soon after settling down at my post,\nI was surprised to hear the man-eaters growling and purring and\ncrunching up bones about seventy yards from the crib. I could not\nunderstand what they had found to eat, as I had heard no commotion in\nthe camps, and I knew by bitter experience that every meal the brutes\nobtained from us was announced by shrieks and uproar. The only\nconclusion I could come to was that they had pounced upon some poor\nunsuspecting native traveller. After a time I was able to make out\ntheir eyes glowing in the darkness, and I took as careful aim as was\npossible in the circumstances and fired; but the only notice they paid\nto the shot was to carry off whatever they were devouring and to retire\nquietly over a slight rise, which prevented me from seeing them. There\nthey finished their meal at their ease.\n\nAs soon as it was daylight, I got out of my crib and went towards the\nplace where I had last heard them. On the way, whom should I meet but\nmy missing guest, Mr. Whitehead, looking very pale and ill, and\ngenerally dishevelled.\n\n\"Where on earth have you come from?\" I exclaimed. \"Why didn't you turn\nup to dinner last night?\"\n\n\"A nice reception you give a fellow when you invite him to dinner,\" was\nhis only reply.\n\n\"Why, what's up?\" I asked.\n\n\"That infernal lion of yours nearly did for me last night,\" said\nWhitehead.\n\n\"Nonsense, you must have dreamed it!\" I cried in astonishment.\n\nFor answer he turned round and showed me his back. \"That's not much of\na dream, is it?\" he asked.\n\nHis clothing was rent by one huge tear from the nape of the neck\ndownwards, and on the flesh there were four great claw marks, showing\nred and angry through the torn cloth. Without further parley, I hurried\nhim off to my tent, and bathed and dressed his wounds; and when I had\nmade him considerably more comfortable, I got from him the whole story\nof the events of the night.\n\nIt appeared that his train was very late, so that it was quite dark\nwhen he arrived at Tsavo Station, from which the track to my camp lay\nthrough a small cutting. He was accompanied by Abdullah, his sergeant\nof askaris, who walked close behind him carrying a lighted lamp. All\nwent well until they were about half-way through the gloomy cutting,\nwhen one of the lions suddenly jumped down upon them from the high\nbank, knocking Whitehead over like a ninepin, and tearing his back in\nthe manner I had seen. Fortunately, however, he had his carbine with\nhim, and instantly fired. The flash and the loud report must have dazed\nthe lion for a second or two, enabling Whitehead to disengage himself;\nbut the next instant the brute pounced like lightning on the\nunfortunate Abdullah, with whom he at once made off. All that the poor\nfellow could say was: \"Eh, Bwana, simba\" (\"Oh, Master, a lion\"). As the\nlion was dragging him over the bank, Whitehead fired again, but without\neffect, and the brute quickly disappeared into the darkness with his\nprey. It was of course, this unfortunate man whom I had heard the lions\ndevouring during the night. Whitehead himself had a marvellous escape;\nhis wounds were happily not very deep, and caused him little or no\ninconvenience afterwards.\n\nOn the same day, December 3, the forces arrayed against the lions were\nfurther strengthened. Mr. Farquhar, the Superintendent of Police,\narrived from the coast with a score of sepoys to assist in hunting down\nthe man-eaters, whose fame had by this time spread far and wide, and\nthe most elaborate precautions were taken, his men being posted on the\nmost convenient trees near every camp. Several other officials had also\ncome up on leave to join in the chase, and each of these guarded a\nlikely spot in the same way, Mr. Whitehead sharing my post inside the\ncrib on the girder. Further, in spite of some chaff, my lion trap was\nput in thorough working order, and two of the sepoys were installed as\nbait.\n\nOur preparations were quite complete by nightfall, and we all took up\nour appointed positions. Nothing happened until about nine o'clock,\nwhen to my great satisfaction the intense stillness was suddenly broken\nby the noise of the door of the trap clattering down. \"At last,\" I\nthought, \"one at least of the brutes is done for.\" But the sequel was\nan ignominious one.\n\nThe bait-sepoys had a lamp burning inside their part of the cage, and\nwere each armed with a Martini rifle, with plenty of ammunition. They\nhad also been given strict orders to shoot at once if a lion should\nenter the trap. Instead of doing so, however, they were so terrified\nwhen he rushed in and began to lash himself madly against the bars of\nthe cage, that they completely lost their heads and were actually too\nunnerved to fire. Not for some minutes--not, indeed, until Mr.\nFarquhar, whose post was close by, shouted at them and cheered them\non--did they at all recover themselves. Then when at last they did\nbegin to fire, they fired with a vengeance--anywhere, anyhow. Whitehead\nand I were at right angles to the direction in which they should have\nshot, and yet their bullets came whizzing all round us. Altogether they\nfired over a score of shots, and in the end succeeded only in blowing\naway one of the bars of the door, thus allowing our prize to make good\nhis escape. How they failed to kill him several times over is, and\nalways will be, a complete mystery to me, as they could have put the\nmuzzles of their rifles absolutely touching his body. There was,\nindeed, some blood scattered about the trap, but it was small\nconsolation to know that the brute, whose capture and death seemed so\ncertain, had only been slightly wounded.\n\nStill we were not unduly dejected, and when morning came, a hunt was at\nonce arranged. Accordingly we spent the greater part of the day on our\nhands and knees following the lions through the dense thickets of\nthorny jungle, but though we heard their growls from time to time, we\nnever succeeded in actually coming up with them. Of the whole party,\nonly Farquhar managed to catch a momentary glimpse of one as it bounded\nover a bush. Two days more were spent in the same manner, and with\nequal unsuccess; and then Farquhar and his sepoys were obliged to\nreturn to the coast. Mr. Whitehead also departed for his district, and\nonce again I was left alone with the man-eaters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE FIRST MAN-EATER\n\n\nA day or two after the departure of my allies, as I was leaving my boma\nsoon after dawn on December 9, I saw a Swahili running excitedly\ntowards me, shouting out \"Simba! Simba!\" (\"Lion! Lion!\"), and every now\nand again looking behind him as he ran. On questioning him I found that\nthe lions had tried to snatch a man from the camp by the river, but\nbeing foiled in this had seized and killed one of the donkeys, and were\nat that moment busy devouring it not far off. Now was my chance.\n\nI rushed for the heavy rifle which Farquhar had kindly left with me for\nuse in case an opportunity such as this should arise, and, led by the\nSwahili, I started most carefully to stalk the lions, who, I devoutly\nhoped, were confining their attention strictly to their meal. I was\ngetting on splendidly, and could just make out the outline of one of\nthem through the dense bush, when unfortunately my guide snapped a\nrotten branch. The wily beast heard the noise, growled his defiance,\nand disappeared in a moment into a patch of even thicker jungle close\nby. In desperation at the thought of his escaping me once again, I\ncrept hurriedly back to the camp, summoned the available workmen and\ntold them to bring all the tom-toms, tin cans, and other noisy\ninstruments of any kind that could be found. As quickly as possible I\nposted them in a half-circle round the thicket, and gave the head\njemadar instructions to start a simultaneous beating of the tom-toms\nand cans as soon as he judged that I had had time to get round to the\nother side. I then crept round by myself and soon found a good position\nand one which the lion was most likely to retreat past, as it was in\nthe middle of a broad animal path leading straight from the place where\nhe was concealed. I lay down behind a small ant hill, and waited\nexpectantly. Very soon I heard a tremendous din being raised by the\nadvancing line of coolies, and almost immediately, to my intense joy,\nout into the open path stepped a huge maneless lion. It was the first\noccasion during all these trying months upon which I had had a fair\nchance at one of these brutes, and my satisfaction at the prospect of\nbagging him was unbounded.\n\nSlowly he advanced along the path, stopping every few seconds to look\nround. I was only partially concealed from view, and if his attention\nhad not been so fully occupied by the noise behind him, he must have\nobserved me. As he was oblivious to my presence, however, I let him\napproach to within about fifteen yards of me, and then covered him with\nmy rifle. The moment I moved to do this, he caught sight of me, and\nseemed much astonished at my sudden appearance, for he stuck his\nforefeet into the ground, threw himself back on his haunches and\ngrowled savagely. As I covered his brain with my rifle, I felt that at\nlast I had him absolutely at my mercy, but .... never trust an\nuntried weapon! I pulled the trigger, and to my horror heard the dull\nsnap that tells of a misfire.\n\nWorse was to follow. I was so taken aback and disconcerted by this\nuntoward accident that I entirely forgot to fire the left barrel, and\nlowered the rifle from my shoulder with the intention of reloading--if\nI should be given time. Fortunately for me, the lion was so distracted\nby the terrific din and uproar of the coolies behind him that instead\nof springing on me, as might have been expected, he bounded aside into\nthe jungle again. By this time I had collected my wits, and just as he\njumped I let him have the left barrel. An answering angry growl told me\nthat he had been hit; but nevertheless he succeeded once more in\ngetting clear away, for although I tracked him for some little\ndistance, I eventually lost his trail in a rocky patch of ground.\n\nBitterly did I anathematise the hour in which I had relied on a\nborrowed weapon, and in my disappointment and vexation I abused owner,\nmaker, and rifle with fine impartiality. On extracting the unexploded\ncartridge, I found that the needle had not struck home, the cap being\nonly slightly dented; so that the whole fault did indeed lie with the\nrifle, which I later returned to Farquhar with polite compliments.\nSeriously, however, my continued ill-luck was most exasperating; and\nthe result was that the Indians were more than ever confirmed in their\nbelief that the lions were really evil spirits, proof against mortal\nweapons. Certainly, they did seem to bear charmed lives.\n\nAfter this dismal failure there was, of course, nothing to do but to\nreturn to camp. Before doing so, however, I proceeded to view the dead\ndonkey, which I found to have been only slightly devoured it the\nquarters. It is a curious fact that lions always begin at the tail of\ntheir prey and eat upwards towards the head. As their meal had thus\nbeen interrupted evidently at the very beginning, I felt pretty sure\nthat one or other of the brutes would return to the carcase at\nnightfall. Accordingly, as there was no tree of any kind close at hand,\nI had a staging erected some ten feet away from the body. This machan\nwas about twelve feet high and was composed of four poles stuck into\nthe ground and inclined towards each other at the top, where a plank\nwas lashed to serve as a seat. Further, as the nights were still pitch\ndark, I had the donkey's carcase secured by strong wires to a\nneighbouring stump, so that the lions might not be able to drag it away\nbefore I could get a shot at them.\n\nAt sundown, therefore, I took up my position on my airy perch, and much\nto the disgust of my gun-bearer, Mahina, I decided to go alone. I would\ngladly have taken him with me, indeed, but he had a bad cough, and I\nwas afraid lest he should make any involuntary noise or movement which\nmight spoil all. Darkness fell almost immediately, and everything\nbecame extraordinarily still. The silence of an African jungle on a\ndark night needs to be experienced to be realised; it is most\nimpressive, especially when one is absolutely alone and isolated from\none's fellow creatures, as I was then. The solitude and stillness, and\nthe purpose of my vigil, all had their effect on me, and from a\ncondition of strained expectancy I gradually fell into a dreamy mood\nwhich harmonised well with my surroundings. Suddenly I was startled out\nof my reverie by the snapping of a twig: and, straining my ears for a\nfurther sound, I fancied I could hear the rustling of a large body\nforcing its way through the bush. \"The man-eater,\" I thought to myself;\n\"surely to-night my luck will change and I shall bag one of the\nbrutes.\" Profound silence again succeeded; I sat on my eyrie like a\nstatue, every nerve tense with excitement. Very soon, however, all\ndoubt as to the presence of the lion was dispelled. A deep long-drawn\nsigh--sure sign of hunger--came up from the bushes, and the rustling\ncommenced again as he cautiously advanced. In a moment or two a sudden\nstop, followed by an angry growl, told me that my presence had been\nnoticed; and I began to fear that disappointment awaited me once more.\n\nBut no; matters quickly took an unexpected turn. The hunter became the\nhunted; and instead of either making off or coming for the bait\nprepared for him, the lion began stealthily to stalk me! For about two\nhours he horrified me by slowly creeping round and round my crazy\nstructure, gradually edging his way nearer and nearer. Every moment I\nexpected him to rush it; and the staging had not been constructed with\nan eye to such a possibility. If one of the rather flimsy poles should\nbreak, or if the lion could spring the twelve feet which separated me\nfrom the ground ... the thought was scarcely a pleasant one. I began\nto feel distinctly \"creepy,\" and heartily repented my folly in having\nplaced myself in such a dangerous position. I kept perfectly still,\nhowever, hardly daring even to blink my eyes: but the long-continued\nstrain was telling on my nerves, and my feelings may be better imagined\nthan described when about midnight suddenly something came flop and\nstruck me on the back of the head. For a moment I was so terrified that\nI nearly fell off the plank, as I thought that the lion had sprung on\nme from behind. Regaining my senses in a second or two, I realised that\nI had been hit by nothing more formidable than an owl, which had\ndoubtless mistaken me for the branch of a tree--not a very alarming\nthing to happen in ordinary circumstances, I admit, but coming at the\ntime it did, it almost paralysed me. The involuntary start which I\ncould not help giving was immediately answered by a sinister growl from\nbelow.\n\nAfter this I again kept as still as I could, though absolutely\ntrembling with excitement; and in a short while I heard the lion begin\nto creep stealthily towards me. I could barely make out his form as he\ncrouched among the whitish undergrowth; but I saw enough for my\npurpose, and before he could come any nearer, I took careful aim and\npulled the trigger. The sound of the shot was at once followed by a\nmost terrific roar, and then I could hear him leaping about in all\ndirections. I was no longer able to see him, however, as his first\nbound had taken him into the thick bush; but to make assurance doubly\nsure, I kept blazing away in the direction in which I heard him\nplunging about. At length came a series of mighty groans, gradually\nsubsiding into deep sighs, and finally ceasing altogether; and I felt\nconvinced that one of the \"devils\" who had so long harried us would\ntrouble us no more.\n\nAs soon as I ceased firing, a tumult of inquiring voices was borne\nacross the dark jungle from the men in camp about a quarter of a mile\naway. I shouted back that I was safe and sound, and that one of the\nlions was dead: whereupon such a mighty cheer went up from all the\ncamps as must have astonished the denizens of the jungle for miles\naround. Shortly I saw scores of lights twinkling through the bushes:\nevery man in camp turned out, and with tom-toms beating and horns\nblowing came running to the scene. They surrounded my eyrie, and to my\namazement prostrated themselves on the ground before me, saluting me\nwith cries of \"Mabarak! Mabarak!\" which I believe means \"blessed one\"\nor \"saviour.\" All the same, I refused to allow any search to be made\nthat night for the body of the lion, in case his companion might be\nclose by; besides, it was possible that he might be still alive, and\ncapable of making a last spring. Accordingly we all returned in triumph\nto the camp, where great rejoicings were kept up for the remainder of\nthe night, the Swahili and other African natives celebrating the\noccasion by an especially wild and savage dance.\n\nFor my part, I anxiously awaited the dawn; and even before it was\nthoroughly light I was on my way to the eventful spot, as I could not\ncompletely persuade myself that even yet the \"devil\" might not have\neluded me in some uncanny and mysterious way. Happily my fears proved\ngroundless, and I was relieved to find that my luck--after playing me\nso many exasperating tricks--had really turned at last. I had scarcely\ntraced the blood for more than a few paces when, on rounding a bush, I\nwas startled to see a huge lion right in front of me, seemingly alive\nand crouching for a spring. On looking closer, however, I satisfied\nmyself that he was really and truly stone-dead, whereupon my followers\ncrowded round, laughed and danced and shouted with joy like children,\nand bore me in triumph shoulder-high round the dead body. These\nthanksgiving ceremonies being over, I examined the body and found that\ntwo bullets had taken effect--one close behind the left shoulder,\nevidently penetrating the heart, and the other in the off hind leg. The\nprize was indeed one to be proud of; his length from tip of nose to tip\nof tail was nine feet eight inches, he stood three feet nine inches\nhigh, and it took eight men to carry him back to camp. The only blemish\nwas that the skin was much scored by the boma thorns through which he\nhad so often forced his way in carrying off his victims.\n\nThe news of the death of one of the notorious man-eaters soon spread\nfar and wide over the country: telegrams of congratulation came pouring\nin, and scores of people flocked from up and down the railway to see\nthe skin for themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE DEATH OF THE SECOND MAN-EATER\n\n\nIt must not be imagined that with the death of this lion our troubles\nat Tsavo were at an end; his companion was still at large, and very\nsoon began to make us unpleasantly aware of the fact. Only a few nights\nelapsed before he made an attempt to get at the Permanent Way\nInspector, climbing up the steps of his bungalow and prowling round the\nverandah. The Inspector, hearing the noise and thinking it was a\ndrunken coolie, shouted angrily \"Go away!\" but, fortunately for him,\ndid not attempt to come out or to open the door. Thus disappointed in\nhis attempt to obtain a meal of human flesh, the lion seized a couple\nof the Inspector's goats and devoured them there and then.\n\nOn hearing of this occurrence, I determined to sit up the next night\nnear the Inspector's bungalow. Fortunately there was a vacant iron\nshanty close at hand, with a convenient loophole in it for firing from;\nand outside this I placed three full-grown goats as bait, tying them to\na half-length of rail, weighing about 250 lbs. The night passed\nuneventfully until just before daybreak, when at last the lion turned\nup, pounced on one of the goats and made off with it, at the same time\ndragging away the others, rail and all. I fired several shots in his\ndirection, but it was pitch dark and quite impossible to see anything,\nso I only succeeded in hitting one of the goats. I often longed for a\nflash-light on such occasions.\n\nNext morning I started off in pursuit and was joined by some others\nfrom the camp. I found that the trail of the goats and rail was easily\nfollowed, and we soon came up, about a quarter of a mile away, to where\nthe lion was still busy at his meal. He was concealed in some thick\nbush and growled angrily on hearing our approach; finally, as we got\ncloser, he suddenly made a charge, rushing through the bushes at a\ngreat pace. In an instant, every man of the party scrambled hastily up\nthe nearest tree, with the exception of one of my assistants, Mr.\nWinkler, who stood steadily by me throughout. The brute, however, did\nnot press his charge home: and on throwing stones into the bushes where\nwe had last seen him, we guessed by the silence that he had slunk off.\nWe therefore advanced cautiously, and on getting up to the place\ndiscovered that he had indeed escaped us, leaving two off the goats\nscarcely touched.\n\nThinking that in all probability the lion would return as usual to\nfinish his meal, I had a very strong scaffolding put up a few feet away\nfrom the dead goats, and took up my position on it before dark. On this\noccasion I brought my gun-bearer, Mahina, to take a turn at watching,\nas I was by this time worn out for want of sleep, having spent so many\nnights on the look-out. I was just dozing off comfortably when suddenly\nI felt my arm seized, and on looking up saw Mahina pointing in the\ndirection of the goats. \"Sher!\" (\"Lion!\") was all he whispered. I\ngrasped my double smooth-bore, which, I had charged with slug, and\nwaited patiently. In a few moments I was rewarded, for as I watched the\nspot where I expected the lion to appear, there was a rustling among\nthe bushes and I saw him stealthily emerge into the open and pass\nalmost directly beneath us. I fired both barrels practically together\ninto his shoulder, and to my joy could see him go down under the force\nof the blow. Quickly I reached for the magazine rifle, but before I\ncould use it, he was out of sight among the bushes, and I had to fire\nafter him quite at random. Nevertheless I was confident of getting him\nin the morning, and accordingly set out as soon as it was light. For\nover a mile there was no difficulty in following the blood-trail, and\nas he had rested several times I felt sure that he had been badly\nwounded. In the end, however, my hunt proved fruitless, for after a\ntime the traces of blood ceased and the surface of the ground became\nrocky, so that I was no longer able to follow the spoor.\n\nAbout this time Sir Guilford Molesworth, K.C.I.E., late Consulting\nEngineer to the Government of India for State Railways, passed through\nTsavo on a tour of inspection on behalf of the Foreign Office. After\nexamining the bridge and other works and expressing his satisfaction,\nhe took a number of photographs, one or two of which he has kindly\nallowed me to reproduce in this book. He thoroughly sympathised with us\nin all the trials we had endured from the man-eaters, and was delighted\nthat one at least was dead. When he asked me if I expected to get the\nsecond lion soon, I well remember his half-doubting smile as I rather\ntoo confidently asserted that I hoped to bag him also in the course of\na few days.\n\nAs it happened, there was no sign of our enemy for about ten days after\nthis, and we began to hope that he had died of his wounds in the bush.\nAll the same we still took every precaution at night, and it was\nfortunate that we did so, as otherwise at least one more victim would\nhave been added to the list. For on the night of December 27, I was\nsuddenly aroused by terrified shouts from my trolley men, who slept in\na tree close outside my boma, to the effect that a lion was trying to\nget at them. It would have been madness to have gone out, as the moon\nwas hidden by dense clouds and it was absolutely impossible to see\nanything more than a yard in front of one; so all I could do was to\nfire off a few rounds just to frighten the brute away. This apparently\nhad the desired effect, for the men were not further molested that\nnight; but the man-eater had evidently prowled about for some time, for\nwe found in the morning that he had gone right into every one of their\ntents, and round the tree was a regular ring of his footmarks.\n\nThe following evening I took up my position in this same tree, in the\nhope that he would make another attempt. The night began badly, as,\nwhile climbing up to my perch I very nearly put my hand on a venomous\nsnake which was lying coiled round one of the branches. As may be\nimagined, I came down again very quickly, but one of my men managed to\ndespatch it with a long pole. Fortunately the night was clear and\ncloudless, and the moon made every thing almost as bright as day. I\nkept watch until about 2 a.m., when I roused Mahina to take his turn.\nFor about an hour I slept peacefully with my back to the tree, and then\nwoke suddenly with an uncanny feeling that something was wrong. Mahina,\nhowever, was on the alert, and had seen nothing; and although I looked\ncarefully round us on all sides, I too could discover nothing unusual.\nOnly half satisfied, I was about to lie back again, when I fancied I\nsaw something move a little way off among the low bushes. On gazing\nintently at the spot for a few seconds, I found I was not mistaken. It\nwas the man-eater, cautiously stalking us.\n\nThe ground was fairly open round our tree, with only a small bush every\nhere and there; and from our position it was a most fascinating sight\nto watch this great brute stealing stealthily round us, taking\nadvantage of every bit of cover as he came. His skill showed that he\nwas an old hand at the terrible game of man-hunting: so I determined to\nrun no undue risk of losing him this time. I accordingly waited until\nhe got quite close--about twenty yards away--and then fired my .303 at\nhis chest. I heard the bullet strike him, but unfortunately it had no\nknockdown effect, for with a fierce growl he turned and made off with\ngreat long bounds. Before he disappeared from sight, however, I managed\nto have three more shots at him from the magazine rifle, and another\ngrowl told me that the last of these had also taken effect.\n\nWe awaited daylight with impatience, and at the first glimmer of dawn\nwe set out to hunt him down. I took a native tracker with me, so that I\nwas free to keep a good look-out, while Mahina followed immediately\nbehind with a Martini carbine. Splashes of blood being plentiful, we\nwere able to get along quickly; and we had not proceeded more than a\nquarter of a mile through the jungle when suddenly a fierce warning\ngrowl was heard right in front of us. Looking cautiously through the\nbushes, I could see the man-eater glaring out in our direction, and\nshowing his tusks in an angry snarl. I at once took careful aim and\nfired. Instantly he sprang out and made a most determined charge down\non us. I fired again and knocked him over; but in a second he was up\nonce more and coming for me as fast as he could in his crippled\ncondition. A third shot had no apparent effect, so I put out my hand\nfor the Martini, hoping to stop him with it. To my dismay, however, it\nwas not there. The terror of the sudden charge had proved too much for\nMahina, and both he and the carbine were by this time well on their way\nup a tree. In the circumstances there was nothing to do but follow\nsuit, which I did without loss of time: and but for the fact that one\nof my shots had broken a hind leg, the brute would most certainly have\nhad me. Even as it was, I had barely time to swing myself up out of his\nreach before he arrived at the foot of the tree.\n\nWhen the lion found he was too late, he started to limp back to the\nthicket; but by this time I had seized the carbine from Mahina, and the\nfirst shot I fired from it seemed to give him his quietus, for he fell\nover and lay motionless. Rather foolishly, I at once scrambled down\nfrom the tree and walked up towards him. To my surprise and no little\nalarm he jumped up and attempted another charge. This time, however, a\nMartini bullet in the chest and another in the head finished him for\ngood and all; he dropped in his tracks not five yards away from me, and\ndied gamely, biting savagely at a branch which had fallen to the ground.\n\nBy this time all the workmen in camp, attracted by the sound of the\nfiring, had arrived on the scene, and so great was their resentment\nagainst the brute who had killed such numbers of their comrades that it\nwas only with the greatest difficulty that I could restrain them from\ntearing the dead body to pieces. Eventually, amid the wild rejoicings\nof the natives and coolies, I had the lion carried to my boma, which\nwas close at hand. On examination we found no less than six bullet\nholes in the body, and embedded only a little way in the flesh of the\nback was the slug which I had fired into him from the scaffolding about\nten days previously. He measured nine feet six inches from tip of nose\nto tip of tail, and stood three feet eleven and a half inches high;\nbut, as in the case of his companion, the skin was disfigured by being\ndeeply scored all over by the boma thorns.\n\nThe news of the death of the second \"devil\" soon spread far and wide\nover the country, and natives actually travelled from up and down the\nline to have a look at my trophies and at the \"devil-killer\", as they\ncalled me. Best of all, the coolies who had absconded came flocking\nback to Tsavo, and much to my relief work was resumed and we were never\nagain troubled by man-eaters. It was amusing, indeed, to notice the\nchange which took place in the attitude of the workmen towards me after\nI had killed the two lions. Instead of wishing to murder me, as they\nonce did, they could not now do enough for me, and as a token of their\ngratitude they presented me with a beautiful silver bowl, as well as\nwith a long poem written in Hindustani describing all our trials and my\nultimate victory. As the poem relates our troubles in somewhat quaint\nand biblical language, I have given a translation of it in the\nappendix. The bowl I shall always consider my most highly prized and\nhardest won trophy. The inscription on it reads as follows:--\n\n\nSIR,--We, your Overseer, Timekeepers, Mistaris and Workmen, present you\nwith this bowl as a token of our gratitude to you for your bravery in\nkilling two man-eating lions at great risk to your own life, thereby\nsaving us from the fate of being devoured by these terrible monsters\nwho nightly broke into our tents and took our fellow-workers from our\nside. In presenting you with this bowl, we all add our prayers for your\nlong life, happiness and prosperity. We shall ever remain, Sir, Your\ngrateful servants,\n\nBaboo PURSHOTAM HURJEE PURMAR,\n  Overseer and Clerk of Works,\n    on behalf of your Workmen.\n      Dated at Tsavo, January 30, 1899.\n\n\nBefore I leave the subject of \"the man-eaters of Tsavo,\" it may be of\ninterest to mention that these two lions possess the distinction,\nprobably unique among wild animals, of having been specifically\nreferred to in the House of Lords by the Prime Minister of the day.\nSpeaking of the difficulties which had been encountered in the\nconstruction of the Uganda Railway, the late Lord Salisbury said:--\n\n\"The whole of the works were put a stop to for three weeks because a\nparty of man-eating lions appeared in the locality and conceived a most\nunfortunate taste for our porters. At last the labourers entirely\ndeclined to go on unless they were guarded by an iron entrenchment. Of\ncourse it is difficult to work a railway under these conditions, and\nuntil we found an enthusiastic sportsman to get rid of these lions, our\nenterprise was seriously hindered.\"\n\nAlso, The Spectator of March 3, 1900, had an article entitled \"The\nLions that Stopped the Railway,\" from which the following extracts are\ntaken:--\n\n\"The parallel to the story of the lions which stopped the rebuilding of\nSamaria must occur to everyone, and if the Samaritans had quarter as\ngood cause for their fears as had the railway coolies, their wish to\npropitiate the local deities is easily understood. If the whole body of\nlion anecdote, from the days of the Assyrian Kings till the last year\nof the nineteenth century, were collated and brought together, it would\nnot equal in tragedy or atrocity, in savageness or in sheer insolent\ncontempt for man, armed or unarmed, white or black, the story of these\ntwo beasts.\n\n\"To what a distance the whole story carries us back, and how impossible\nit becomes to account for the survival of primitive man against this\nkind of foe! For fire--which has hitherto been regarded as his main\nsafeguard against the carnivora--these cared nothing. It is curious\nthat the Tsavo lions were not killed by poison, for strychnine is\neasily used, and with effect. (I may mention that poison was tried, but\nwithout effect. The poisoned carcases of transport animals which had\ndied from the bite of the tsetse fly were placed in likely spots, but\nthe wily man-eaters would not touch them, and much preferred live men\nto dead donkeys.) Poison may have been used early in the history of\nman, for its powers are employed with strange skill by the men in the\ntropical forest, both in American and West Central Africa. But there is\nno evidence that the old inhabitants of Europe, or of Assyria or Asia\nMinor, ever killed lions or wolves by this means. They looked to the\nKing or chief, or some champion, to kill these monsters for them. It\nwas not the sport but the duty of. Kings, and was in itself a title to\nbe a ruler of men. Theseus, who cleared the roads of beasts and\nrobbers; Hercules, the lion killer; St. George, the dragon-slayer, and\nall the rest of their class owed to this their everlasting fame. From\nthe story of the Tsavo River we can appreciate their services to man\neven at this distance of time. When the jungle twinkled with hundreds\nof lamps, as the shout went on from camp to camp that the first lion\nwas dead, as the hurrying crowds fell prostrate in the midnight forest,\nlaying their heads on his feet, and the Africans danced savage and\nceremonial dances of thanksgiving, Mr. Patterson must have realised in\nno common way what it was to have been a hero and deliverer in the days\nwhen man was not yet undisputed lord of the creation, and might pass at\nany moment under the savage dominion of the beasts.\"\n\nWell had the two man-eaters earned all this fame; they had devoured\nbetween them no less than twenty-eight Indian coolies, in addition to\nscores of unfortunate African natives of whom no official record was\nkept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE COMPLETION OF THE TSAVO BRIDGE\n\n\nWhen all the excitement had died down and there was no longer any dread\nof the man-eaters, work went on briskly, and the bridge over the Tsavo\nrapidly neared completion. As the piers and abutments progressed in\nheight, the question of how to lift the large stones into their\npositions had to be solved. We possessed no cranes for this purpose, so\nI set to work and improvised a shears made of a couple of thirty-foot\nrails. These were bolted together at the top, while the other ends were\nfixed at a distance of about ten feet apart in a large block of wood.\nThis contrivance acted capitally, and by manipulation of ropes and\npulleys the heavy stones were swung into position quickly and without\ndifficulty, so that in a very short time the masonry of the bridge was\ncompleted.\n\nThe next business was to span the sixty-foot distance between the piers\nwith iron girders. As I had neither winches nor sufficient blocks and\ntackle to haul these over into position, I was driven to erect\ntemporary piers in the middle of each span, built up crib-shape of\nwooden sleepers. Great wooden beams were stretched across from the\nstone piers to these cribs, and laid with rails; and the girder was run\nover its exact place, while still on the trucks in which it had been\nbrought up from the coast. It was next \"jacked\" up from the trucks,\nwhich were hauled away empty, the temporary bridge was dismantled, and\nthe girder finally lowered gently into position. When the last girder\nwas thus successfully placed, no time was lost in linking up the\npermanent way, and very soon I had the satisfaction of seeing the first\ntrain cross the finished work.\n\nCuriously enough, only a day or so after the bridge had been completed\nand the intermediate cribs cleared away, a tremendous rain-storm broke\nover the country. The river started to rise rapidly, soon flooding its\nbanks and becoming a raging murky torrent, tearing up trees by the\nroots and whirling them along like straws. Steadily higher and higher\nrose the flood, and standing on my bridge, I watched expectantly for\nthe two temporary trolley bridges--which, it will be remembered, we had\nbuilt across the stream in order to bring stone and sand to the main\nwork--to give way before the ever-rising volume of water. Nor had I\nlong to wait; for I soon caught sight of a solid mass of palm stems and\nrailway sleepers sweeping with almost irresistible force round the bend\nof the river some little distance above the bridge. This I knew was the\ndebris of the trolley crossing furthest up the river. On it came, and\nwith it an additional bank of stormy-looking water. I held my breath\nfor the space of a moment as it actually leaped at the second frail\nstructure; there was a dull thud and a rending and riving of timbers,\nand then the flood rolled on towards me, leaving not a vestige of the\ntwo bridges behind it. The impact, indeed, was so great that the rails\nwere twisted round the broken tree-trunks as if they had been so much\nordinary wire. The double tier of wreckage now swept forward, and\nhurled itself with a sullen plunge against the cutwaters of my stone\npiers. The shock was great, but to my immense satisfaction the bridge\ntook it without a tremor, and I saw the remnant of the temporary\ncrossings swirl through the great spans and quickly disappear on its\njourney to the ocean. I confess that I witnessed the whole occurrence\nwith a thrill of pride.\n\nWe were never long without excitement of some kind or another at Tsavo.\nWhen the camp was not being attacked by man-eating lions, it was\nvisited by leopards, hyenas, wild dogs, wild cats, and other\ninhabitants of the jungle around us. These animals did a great deal of\ndamage to the herds of sheep and goats which were kept to supply the\ncommissariat, and there was always great rejoicing when a capture was\nmade in one of the many traps that were laid for them.\n\nLeopards especially are most destructive, often killing simply for\npleasure and not for food: and I have always harboured animosity\ntowards them since the night when one wantonly destroyed a whole herd\nof mine. I happened at the time to have a flock of about thirty sheep\nand goats which I kept for food and for milk, and which were secured at\nsundown in a grass hut at one corner of my boma. One particularly dark\nnight we were startled by a tremendous commotion in this shed, but as\nthis was before the man-eaters were killed, no one dared stir out to\ninvestigate the cause of the disturbance. I naturally thought that the\nintruder was one of the \"demons,\" but all I could do was to fire\nseveral shots in the direction of the hut, hoping to frighten him away.\nIn spite of these, however, it was some time before the noise died down\nand everything became still again. As soon as it was dawn I went to the\nshed to see what had happened, and there, to my intense anger, I found\nevery one of my sheep and goats lying stretched dead, on the ground\nwith its throat bitten through. A hole had been made through the frail\nwall of the shed, and I saw from this and from the tracks all round\nthat the author of the wholesale slaughter had been a leopard. He had\nnot eaten one of the flock, but had killed them all out of pure love of\ndestruction.\n\nI hoped that he would return the next night to make a meal; and should\nhe do so, I determined to have my revenge. I accordingly left the\ncarcases exactly as they lay, and having a very powerful steel\ntrap--like an enormous rat-trap, and quite strong enough to hold a\nleopard if he should put his foot in it--I placed this in the opening\ninto the shed and secured it by a stout chain to a long stake driven\ninto the ground outside. Darkness found everyone in my boma on the\nalert and listening anxiously to hear the noise the leopard would make\nthe moment he was caught in the trap. Nor were we disappointed, for\nabout midnight we heard the click of the powerful spring, followed\nimmediately by frantic roaring and plunging. I had been sitting all\nevening with my rifle by my side and a lantern lighted, so I\nimmediately rushed out, followed by the chaukidar (watchman) carrying\nthe lamp. As we approached the shed, the leopard made a frantic spring\nin our direction as far as the chain would allow him, and this so\nfrightened the chaukidar that he fled in terror, leaving me in utter\ndarkness. The night was as black as had been the previous one, and I\ncould see absolutely nothing; but I knew the general direction in which\nto fire and accordingly emptied my magazine at the beast. As far as I\ncould make out, he kept dodging in and out through the broken wall of\nthe goat-house; but in a short time my shots evidently told, as his\nstruggles ceased and all was still. I called out that he was dead, and\nat once everyone in the boma turned out, bringing all the lanterns in\nthe place. With the others came my Indian overseer, who shouted that he\ntoo wanted revenge, as some of the goats had belonged to him. Whereupon\nhe levelled his revolver at the dead leopard, and shutting his eyes\ntightly, fired four shots in rapid succession. Naturally not one of\nthese touched the beast, but they caused considerable consternation\namongst the onlookers, who scattered rapidly to right and left. Next\nmorning a party of starving Wa Kamba happened to be passing just as I\nwas about to skin the leopard, and asked by means of signs to be\nallowed to do the job for me and then to take the meat. I of course\nassented to this proposal, and in a very few minutes the skin had been\nneatly taken off, and the famishing natives began a ravenous meal on\nthe raw flesh.\n\nWild dogs are also very destructive, and often caused great losses\namong our sheep and goats. Many a night have I listened to these\nanimals hunting and harrying some poor creature of the wilds round my\ncamp; they never relinquish a chase, and will attack anything, man or\nbeast, when really driven by hunger. I was at Tsavo Station one\nday--unfortunately without my rifle--when one of these dogs came up and\nstood within about thirty yards of me. He was a fine-looking beast,\nbigger than a collie, with jet-black hair and a white-tipped bushy\ntail. I was very sorry that I had not brought my rifle, as I badly\nwanted a specimen and never had another chance of obtaining one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE SWAHILI AND OTHER NATIVE TRIBES\n\n\nI have always been very keenly interested in the different native races\nof Africa, and consequently availed myself of every opportunity of\nstudying their manners and customs. I had little scope for this at\nTsavo, however, as the district around us was practically uninhabited.\nStill there was of course a good number of Swahili among my workmen,\ntogether with a few Wa Kamba, Wa N'yam Wezi, and others, so I soon\nbecame more or less acquainted with the habits of these tribes. The\nSwahili live principally along the coast of British East Africa and at\nZanzibar. They are a mixed race, being the descendants of Arab fathers\nand negro mothers. Their name is derived from the Arabic word suahil,\ncoast; but it has also been said, by some who have found them scarcely\nso guileless as might have been expected, to be really a corruption of\nthe words sawa hili, that is, \"those who cheat all alike.\" However that\nmay be, the men are as a rule of splendid physique and well qualified\nfor the calling that the majority of them follow, that of caravan\nporters. They are a careless, light-hearted, improvident people, and\nare very fond of all the good things of this world, enjoying them\nthoroughly whenever they get the chance. Their life is spent in\njourneying to and from the interior, carrying heavy loads of provisions\nand trade-goods on the one journey, and returning with similar loads of\nivory or other products of the country. They are away for many months\nat a time on these expeditions, and consequently--as they cannot spend\nmoney on the march--they have a goodly number of rupees to draw on\ntheir return to Mombasa. These generally disappear with wonderful\nrapidity, and when no more fun can be bought, they join another caravan\nand begin a new safari to the Great Lakes, or even beyond. Many a time\nhave I watched them trudging along the old caravan road which crossed\nthe Tsavo at a ford about half a mile from the railway station: here a\nhalt was always called, so that they might wash and bathe in the cool\nwaters of the river.\n\nNothing ever seems to damp the spirits of the Swahili porter. Be his\nlife ever so hard, his load ever so heavy, the moment it is off his\nback and he has disposed of his posho (food), he straightway forgets\nall his troubles, and begins to laugh and sing and joke with his\nfellows as if he were the happiest and luckiest mortal alive. Such was\nmy cook, Mabruki, and his merry laugh was quite infectious. I remember\nthat one day he was opening a tin of biscuits for me, and not being\nable to pull off the under-lid with his fingers, he seized the flap in\nhis magnificent teeth and tugged at it. I shouted to him to stop,\nthinking that he might break a tooth; but he misunderstood my\nsolicitude and gravely assured me that he would not spoil the tin!\n\nThe Swahili men wear a long white cotton garment, like a night-shirt,\ncalled a kanzu; the women--who are too liberally endowed to be entirely\ngraceful--go about with bare arms and shoulders, and wear a long\nbrightly-coloured cloth which they wind tightly round their bosoms and\nthen allow to fall to the feet. All are followers of the Prophet, and\ntheir social customs are consequently much the same as those of any\nother Mohammedan race, though with a good admixture of savagedom. They\nhave a happy knack of giving a nickname to every European with whom\nthey have to do, such nickname generally making reference to something\npeculiar or striking in his habits, temper, or appearance. On the\nwhole, they are a kindly, generous folk, whom one cannot help liking.\n\nOf the many tribes which are to be seen about the railway on the way up\nfrom the coast, perhaps the most extraordinary-looking are the Wa\nNyika, the people who inhabit the thorny nyika (wilderness) which\nborders on the Taru Desert. They are exceedingly ugly and of a low\ntype. The men wear nothing in the way of dress but a scanty and very\ndirty cloth thrown over the shoulders, while the women attire\nthemselves only in a short kilt which is tied round them very low at\nthe waist. Both men and women adorn themselves with brass chains round\nthe neck and coils of copper and iron wire round the arms.\n\nThe nearest native inhabitants to Tsavo are the Wa Taita, who dwell in\nthe mountains near N'dii, some thirty miles away. My work often took me\nto this place, and on one of my visits, finding myself with some spare\ntime on my hands, I set out to pay a long promised visit to the\nDistrict Officer. A fairly good road ran from N'dii Station to his\nhouse at the foot of the mountains, about four miles away, and on my\narrival I was not only most hospitably entertained but was also\nintroduced to M'gogo, the Head Chief of the Wa Taita, who had just come\nin for a shauri (consultation) about some affair of State. The old\nfellow appeared delighted to meet me, and promptly invited me to his\nkraal, some way up the hills. I jumped at the prospect of seeing the Wa\nTaita at home, so presently off we started on our heavy climb, my\nIndian servant, Bhawal, coming with us. After a couple of hours' steady\nscramble up a steep and slippery goatpath, we arrived at M'gogo's\ncapital, where I was at once introduced to his wives, who were busily\nengaged in making pombe (a native fermented drink) in the hollowed-out\nstump of a tree. I presented one of them with an orange for her child,\nbut she did not understand what it was for on tasting it she made a wry\nface and would not eat it. Still she did not throw it away, but\ncarefully put it into a bag with her other treasures--doubtless for\nfuture investigation. As soon as the women saw Bhawal, however, he\nbecame the centre of attraction, and I was eclipsed. He happened to\nhave on a new puggaree, with lots of gold work on it, and this took\ntheir fancy immensely; they examined every line most carefully and went\ninto ecstasies over it--just as their European sisters would have done\nover the latest Parisian creation.\n\nWe made a short halt for rest and refreshment, and then started again\non our journey to the top of the hills. After a stiff climb for another\ntwo hours, part of it through a thick black forest, we emerged on the\nsummit, where I found I was well rewarded for my trouble by the\nmagnificent views we obtained on all sides. The great Kilima N'jaro\nstood out particularly well, and made a very effective background to\nthe fine panorama. I was surprised to find a number of well-fed cattle\non the mountain top, but I fancy M'gogo thought I was casting an evil\nspell over them when he saw me taking photographs of them as they\ngrazed peacefully on the sweet grass which covered the plateau.\n\nLike most other natives of Africa, the Wa Taita are exceedingly\nsuperstitious, and this failing is turned to good account by the\nall-powerful \"witch-doctor\" or \"medicine-man.\" It is, for instance, an\nextraordinary sight to see the absolute faith with which a Ki Taita\nwill blow the simba-dawa, or \"lion medicine \", to the four points of\nthe compass before lying down to sleep in the open. This dawa--which\nis, of course, obtainable only from the witch-doctor--consists simply\nof a little black powder, usually carried in a tiny horn stuck through\na slit in the ear; but the Ki Taita firmly believes that a few grains\nof this dust blown round him from the palm of the hand is a complete\nsafeguard against raging lions seeking whom they may devour; and after\nthe blowing ceremony he will lie down to sleep in perfect confidence,\neven in the midst of a man-eater's district. In the nature of things,\nmoreover, he never loses this touching faith in the efficacy of the\nwitch-doctor's charm; for if he is attacked by a lion, the brute sees\nto it that he does not live to become an unbeliever, while if he is not\nattacked, it is of course quite clear that it is to the dawa that he\nowes his immunity.\n\nFor the rest, the Wa Taita are essentially a peace-loving and\nindustrious people; and, indeed, before the arrival of the British in\nthe country, they hardly ever ventured down from their mountain\nfastnesses, owing to their dread of the warlike Masai. Each man has as\nmany wives as he can afford to pay for in sheep or cattle; he provides\neach spouse with a separate establishment, but the family huts are\nclustered together, and as a rule all live in perfect harmony. The most\ncurious custom of the tribe is the filing of the front teeth into sharp\npoints, which gives the whole face a most peculiar and rather\ndiabolical expression. As usual, their ideas of costume are rather\nprimitive; the men sometimes wear a scrap of cloth round the loins,\nwhile the women content themselves with the same or with a short kilt.\nBoth sexes adorn themselves with a great quantity of copper or iron\nwire coiled round their arms and legs, and smear their bodies all over\nwith grease, the men adding red clay to the mixture. Many of the women\nalso wear dozens of rows of beads, while their ears are hung with\npieces of chain and other fantastic ornaments. The men always carry\nbows and poisoned arrows, as well as a seemie (a short,\nroughly-fashioned sword) hung on a leathern thong round the waist. A\nthree-legged stool is also an important part of their equipment, and is\nslung on the shoulder when on the march.\n\nThe next people met with on the road to the Great Lakes are the Wa\nKamba, who inhabit the Ukambani province, and may be seen from M'toto\nAndei to the Athi River. They are a very large tribe, but have little\ncohesion, being split up, into many clans under chiefs who govern in a\npatriarchal kind of way. In appearance and dress--or the want of\nit--they are very like the Wa Taita, and they have the same custom of\nfiling the front teeth. As a rule, too, they are a peace-loving people,\nthough when driven to it by hunger they will commit very cruel and\ntreacherous acts of wholesale murder. While the railway was being\nconstructed, a severe famine occurred in their part of the country,\nwhen hundreds of them died of starvation. During this period they\nseveral times swooped down on isolated railway maintenance gangs and\nutterly annihilated them, in order to obtain possession of the food\nwhich they knew would be stored in the camps. These attacks were always\nmade by night. Like most other native races in East Africa, their only\narms are the bow and poisoned arrow, but in the use of these primitive\nweapons they are specially expert. The arrow-head remains in the flesh\nwhen the shaft is withdrawn, and if the poison is fresh, paralysis and\ndeath very quickly follow, the skin round the wound turning yellow and\nmortifying within an hour or two. This deadly poison is obtained, I\nbelieve, by boiling down a particular root, the arrow-heads being\ndipped in the black, pitchy-looking essence which remains. I am glad to\nsay, however, that owing to the establishment of several Mission\nStations amongst them, the Wa Kamba are quickly becoming the most\ncivilised natives in the country; and the missionaries have adopted the\nsensible course of teaching the people husbandry and the practical arts\nand crafts of everyday life, in addition to caring for their spiritual\nneeds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA NIGHT AFTER HIPPO\n\n\nDuring my stay at Tsavo I made many little excursions into the\nsurrounding country, and used to go off on a short shooting and\nexploring expedition whenever I had the opportunity. I was especially\nanxious to bag a hippopotamus, so I made up my mind to try my luck on\nthe banks of the Sabaki. Unfortunately, I possessed no heavy rifle,\nwhich is almost a necessity for hippo shooting, but it occurred to me\nto supply the deficiency by manufacturing a few cartridges for my\nsmoothbore. In these I had double charges of powder and a hardened\nbullet made of lead mixed with about an eighth part of tin. I well\nremember the anxiety with which I fired the first round of my home-made\nammunition. As I more than half expected that the barrel would burst, I\nlashed the gun in the fork of a tree, tied a piece of string a hundred\nfeet long to the trigger, and then--taking shelter behind a friendly\nstump--pulled off. To my great satisfaction the barrel stood the test\nperfectly. More than that, on trying the penetrative effect of my\nbullets, I found that they would smash through a steel plate an eighth\nof an inch thick at thirty yards' range. This was quite good enough for\nmy purpose, and gave me great confidence in the weapon. All the same, I\nhad a very narrow escape one day while manufacturing some of this\nammunition. My plan was to remove the shot from the cartridge, put in\nthe additional powder, and ram this well in before replacing the wad\nand putting in the bullet. I had clamped my refilling machine to my\nrough-hewn table, and was stamping the double charge of powder well\ndown into the cartridge, when suddenly, for some unknown reason, the\nwhole charge exploded right into my face. Everything became pitch dark\nto me, and I groped my way about the little hut in agony of mind as\nwell as of body, for I thought I had been blinded. I am thankful to\nsay, however, that gleams of light soon began to return to my eyes, and\nin a few hours' time I was almost all right again and able to go on\nwith my cartridge making.\n\nAll my preparations having been made, I set out for the Sabaki, taking\nwith me my Indian gun-bearer Mahina, my cook Mabruki, a bhisti\n(water-carrier), and a couple of natives to carry our odds and ends. On\nthese occasions I usually took no tent, but bivouacked in the open. We\ntook some bread and a few tinned provisions with us, but I could always\ndepend upon getting a paa, guinea-fowl, partridge or rock-rabbit for\nthe larder on the march. These rock-rabbits are more like big rats than\nrabbits, and are found in great numbers among the rocks along the banks\nof the rivers. They are not at all bad eating, but the Swahili will not\ntouch them. They call them tupu (shameless, naked things), owing to\ntheir lack of a tail, of which indeed they possess not even a vestige.\n\nOur route lay by the always interesting Tsavo River. Along the banks\neverything within reach of its moisture is delightfully fresh and\ngreen. Palms and other trees, festooned with brilliant flowering\ncreepers, flourish along its course; all kinds of monkeys chatter and\njabber in the shade overhead as they swing themselves from branch to\nbranch, while birds of the most gorgeous plumage flutter about, giving\na very tropical aspect to the scene. On the other hand, if one is\ntempted to stray away from the river, be it only for a few yards, one\ncomes immediately into the parched, thorny wilderness of stunted,\nleafless trees. Here the sun beats down pitilessly, and makes the nyika\nof the Tsavo valley almost intolerable. The river has its source at the\nfoot of snow-crowned Kilima N'jaro, whence it flows for about eighty\nmiles in a northerly direction until it joins the Athi River, about\nseven miles below Tsavo Station. From this point the united streams\ntake the name of Sabaki and flow more or less eastwards until they\nreach the Indian Ocean at Malindi, some seventy miles north of Mombasa.\n\nA narrow and tortuous Masai warpath winds along its whole length, but\nalthough we followed this trail our journey was nevertheless a very\nslow one, owing to the overhanging branches and creepers, from which we\nhad constantly to be disengaged. The march was full of interest,\nhowever, for it was not long before we came upon fresh tracks both of\nhippo and rhino. Every now and again, also, we caught glimpses of\nstartled bush-buck and water-buck, while occasionally the sound of a\nsplash in the water told of a wary crocodile. We had gone about half\nthe distance to the Sabaki when we came upon an unexpected obstacle in\nthe shape of a great ridge of barren, rugged rock, about a hundred feet\nhigh, which extended for about a mile or so on both banks of the river.\nThe sides of this gorge went sheer down into the water, and were quite\nimpossible to scale. I therefore determined to make a detour round it,\nbut Mahina was confident that he could walk along in the river itself.\nI hinted mildly at the possibility of there being crocodiles under the\nrocky ledges. Mahina declared, however, that there was no danger, and\nmaking a bundle of his lower garments, he tied it to his back and\nstepped into the water. For a few minutes all went well. Then, in an\ninstant, he was lifted right off his feet by the rush of the water and\nwhirled away. The river took a sharp bend in this gorge, and he was\nround it and out of our sight in no time, the last glimpse we caught of\nhim showing him vainly trying to catch hold of an overhanging branch.\nAlthough we at once made all the haste we could to get round the ridge\nof rocks, it took us nearly half an hour to do it. I had almost given\nup hope of ever seeing Mahina again, and was much relieved, therefore,\nwhen we reached the river-side once more, to find him safe and sound,\nand little the worse for his adventure. Luckily he had been dashed up\nagainst a rushy bank, and had managed to scramble out with no more\nserious damage than a bruised shin.\n\nEventually we arrived at the junction of the rivers and proceeded some\nway down the Sabaki, beside which the Tsavo looks very insignificant.\nSeveral islands are dotted about in mid-stream and are overgrown with\ntall reeds and rushes, in which hippo find capital covert all the year\nround. As with the Tsavo, the banks of the Sabaki are lined with trees\nof various kinds, affording most welcome shade from the heat of the\nsun: and skirting the river is a caravan road from the interior--still\nused, I believe, for smuggling slaves and ivory to the coast, where\ndhows are in readiness to convey them to Persia or Arabia.\n\nAfter an early dinner, which Mabruki soon got ready, I left my\nfollowers encamped in a safe boma a mile away from the river, and\nstarted out with Mahina to find a suitable tree, near a hippo \"run\", in\nwhich to spend the night. Having some difficulty in finding a likely\nspot, we crossed to the other side of the river--rather a risky thing\nto do on account of the number of crocodiles in it: we found a fairly\nshallow ford, however, and managed to get safely over. Here, on what\nwas evidently an island during flood time, we found innumerable traces\nof both hippo and rhino--in fact the difficulty was to decide which\ntrack was the best and freshest. At length I picked out a tree close to\nthe river and commanding a stretch of sand which was all flattened down\nand looked as if at least one hippo rolled there regularly every night.\n\nAs there was still about an hour before sundown, we did not take up our\nstation at once, but proceeded along the bank to see if any other game\nwas about. We had not gone very far when Mahina, who was a little way\nahead, signalled to me, and on joining him I saw a splendid-looking\nwater-buck standing in a shallow pool of the river. It was the first\ntime I had seen one of these fine antelope, and I was delighted with\nthe sight. I might have got twenty yards or so nearer, but I thought I\nhad better not risk moving, so I aimed at the shoulder and fired. The\nbuck gave one leap into the air, and then turned and galloped quickly\nbehind an island which completely hid him from view. We waited for him\nto clear the rushes at the other end of this island, but as he did not\nappear I got impatient and plunged into the river, regardless of\ncrocodiles or anything else. On rounding the island, however, he was\nnowhere to be seen, and had evidently turned off while in the shelter\nof the reeds and so gained the opposite bank. I was keenly disappointed\nat my failure, for it was impossible to follow him up: to do so we\nshould have had to make a long detour to get across the river, and by\nthat time darkness would have set in. This incident shows the great\ndrawback to the .303--namely, that it has very little knock-down effect\nunless it strikes a vital part; and even then, in a bush country, an\nanimal may manage to go far enough to be lost. On the other hand, an\nanimal wounded with a hard bullet is likely to make a speedy recovery,\nwhich is a great blessing.\n\nMahina was even more upset at the escape of the buck than I was, and as\nwe trudged back through the sand to our tree, he was full of gloomy\nforebodings of an unlucky night. By the light of a splendid full moon\nwe settled ourselves on a great outspreading branch, and commenced our\nvigil. Soon the jungle around us began to be alive with its peculiar\nsounds--a night bird would call, a crocodile shut his jaws with a snap,\nor a rhino or hippo crash through the bushes on its way to the water:\nnow and again we could even hear the distant roar of the lion. Still\nthere was nothing to be seen.\n\nAfter waiting for some considerable time, a great hippo at last made\nhis appearance and came splashing along in our direction, but\nunfortunately took up his position behind a tree which, in the most\ntantalising way, completely hid him from view. Here he stood tooting\nand snorting and splashing about to his heart's content. For what\nseemed hours I watched for this ungainly creature to emerge from his\ncovert, but as he seemed determined not to show himself I lost patience\nand made up my mind to go down after him. I therefore handed my rifle\nto Mahina to lower to me on reaching the ground, and began to descend\ncarefully, holding on by the creepers which encircled the tree. To my\nintense vexation and disappointment, just as I was in this helpless\ncondition, half-way to the ground, the great hippo suddenly came out\nfrom his shelter and calmly lumbered along right underneath me. I\nbitterly lamented my ill-luck and want of patience, for I could almost\nhave touched his broad back as he passed. It was under these\nexasperating conditions that I saw a hippo for the first time, and\nwithout doubt he is the ugliest and most forbidding looking brute I\nhave ever beheld.\n\nThe moment the great beast had passed our tree, he scented us, snorted\nloudly, and dived into the bushes close by, smashing through them like\na traction engine. In screwing myself round to watch him go, I broke\nthe creepers by which I was holding on and landed on my back in the\nsand at the foot of the tree--none the worse for my short drop, but\nconsiderably startled at the thought that the hippo might come back at\nany moment. I climbed up to my perch again without loss of time, but he\nwas evidently as much frightened as I was, and returned no more.\nShortly after this we saw two rhino come down to the river to drink;\nthey were too far off for a shot, however, so I did not disturb them,\nand they gradually waddled up-stream out of sight. Then we heard the\nawe-inspiring roar of a hungry lion close by, and presently another\nhippo gave forth his tooting challenge a little way down the river. As\nthere seemed no likelihood of getting a shot at him from our tree, I\nmade up my mind to stalk him on foot, so we both descended from our\nperch and made our way slowly through the trees in the semi-darkness.\nThere were numbers of animals about, and I am sure that neither of us\nfelt very comfortable as we crept along in the direction of the\nsplashing hippo; for my own part I fancied every moment that I saw in\nfront of me the form of a rhino or a lion ready to charge down upon us\nout of the shadow of the bush.\n\nIn this manner, with nerves strung to the highest pitch, we reached the\nedge of the river in safety, only to find that we were again baulked by\na small rush-covered island, on the other side of which our quarry\ncould be heard. There was a good breeze blowing directly from him,\nhowever, so I thought the best thing to do was to attempt to get on to\nthe island and to have a shot at him from there. Mahina, too, was eager\nfor the fray, so we let ourselves quietly into the water, which here\nwas quite shallow and reached only to our knees, and waded slowly\nacross. On peering cautiously through the reeds at the corner of the\nisland, I was surprised to find that I could see nothing of the hippo;\nbut I soon realised that I was looking too far ahead, for on lowering\nmy eyes there he was, not twenty-five yards away, lying down in the\nshallow water, only half covered and practically facing us. His\ncloseness to us made me rather anxious for our safety, more especially\nas just then he rose to his feet and gave forth the peculiar challenge\nor call which we had already heard so often during the night. All the\nsame, as he raised his head, I fired at it. He whirled round, made a\nplunge forward, staggered and fell, and then lay quite still. To make\nassurance doubly sure, I gave him a couple more bullets as he lay, but\nwe found afterwards that they were not needed, as my first shot had\nbeen a very lucky one and had penetrated the brain. We left him where\nhe fell and got back to our perch, glad and relieved to be in safety\nonce more.\n\nAs soon as it was daylight we were joined by my own men and by several\nWa Kamba, who had been hunting in the neighbourhood. The natives cut\nout the tusks of the hippo, which were rather good ones, and feasted\nravenously on the flesh, while I turned my attention with gratitude to\nthe hot coffee and cakes which Mabruki had meanwhile prepared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA DAY ON THE N'DUNGU ESCARPMENT\n\n\nImmediately after breakfast camp was struck, and accompanied by a few\nof the Wa Kamba, we started off for the N'dungu Escarpment--a frowning\nridge which runs for a great distance parallel to the Sabaki, some\nthree or four miles from its northern bank. We had not gone very far\nbefore I caught sight of a fine waterbuck and successfully bowled him\nover--a good omen for the day, which put us all in excellent spirits.\nMabruki cut off several strips of the tough meat and impaled them on a\nsharp stick to dry in the sun as he went along. I warned him that he\nhad better be careful that a lion did not scent the meat, as if it did\nit would be sure to follow up and kill him. Of course I did not mean\nthis seriously; but Mabruki was a great glutton, and by no means\ncourageous, so I wanted to frighten him.\n\nAs we trudged along towards the hill, I heard a peculiar noise behind a\nsmall rising on our right, and on looking over the crest, I was\ndelighted to see two beautiful giraffe feeding peacefully a little\ndistance away and straining their long necks to get at the tops of some\nmimosa-like trees, while a young one was lying down in the grass quite\nclose to me. For some time I remained concealed, watching the\nfull-grown pair with great interest: they had evidently just come up\nfrom the river, and were slowly making their way back to their home on\nthe escarpment. They seemed on the most affectionate terms,\noccasionally entwining their great long necks and gently biting each\nother on the shoulders. Much as I should have liked to have added a\ngiraffe to my collection of trophies, I left them undisturbed, as I\nthink it a pity to shoot these rather rare and very harmless creatures,\nunless one is required for a special purpose.\n\nWe pushed on, accordingly, towards the escarpment, for I was very\nimpatient to get to the top and explore a place where I felt convinced\nno other white man had ever set foot. From the river the ground rose\ngently upwards to the foot of the ridge, and was covered more or less\ndensely with stunted trees and bushes, and of course the inevitable\n\"wait-a-bit\" thorns. I was fortunate enough, however, to find a rhino\npath which afforded a fairly comfortable and open road, on which we\ncould walk upright the greater part of the way. The climb up the\nescarpment itself was a stiff one, and had to be negotiated principally\non all-fours, but on the way up I discovered that there was an enormous\ncleft some miles to the right which would probably have afforded an\neasier ascent. I had not time to explore it on this particular day, but\nI made a mental note to do so on some future occasion.\n\nAfter a two hours' journey from the river we sat panting on the summit\nafter our scramble and surveyed the valley of the Tsavo, which lay\nspread out like a map about five hundred feet below us. Our home tents,\nthe bridge, Tsavo Station and other buildings were plainly visible, and\nthe railway itself, like a shining snake, could be seen for many miles\nwinding its way through the parched wilderness. Having taken a few\nphotographs of the scene, we turned and struck through the N'dungu\nPlateau. Here I found the same kind of nyika as that round Tsavo, the\nonly difference being that there were more green trees about. The\ncountry, moreover, was somewhat more open, and was intersected by\nhundreds of broad and well-beaten animal paths, along which we could\nwalk upright in comfort. I was leading the way, followed closely by\nMahina and Mabruki, when suddenly we almost walked upon a lion which\nwas lying down at the side of the path and which had probably been\nasleep. It gave a fierce growl and at once bounded off through the\nbush; but to Mabruki--who doubtless recalled then the warning I had\ngiven him in fun earlier in the day--the incident appeared so alarming\nthat he flung down his stick-load of meat and fled for his life, much\nto the amusement of the others, even the usually silent Wa Kamba\njoining in the general laughter as they scrambled for the discarded\nmeat. We saw nothing more of the lion, though a few steps further on\nbrought us to the remains of a zebra which he had recently killed and\nfeasted on; but after this Mabruki kept carefully in the rear.\nCuriously enough, only a short while later we had an exactly similar\nadventure with a rhino, as owing to the tortuous nature of the path, we\nwalked right into it before we were aware. Like the lion, however, it\nwas more frightened than we, and charged away from us through the\njungle.\n\nFor about two hours we pursued our journey into the plateau, and saw\nand heard a wonderful variety of game, including giraffe, rhino,\nbush-buck, the lesser kudu, zebra, wart-hog, baboons and monkeys, and\nany number of paa, the last being of a redder colour than those of the\nTsavo valley. Of natives or of human habitations, however, we saw no\nsigns, and indeed the whole region was so dry and waterless as to be\nquite uninhabitable. The animals that require water have to make a\nnightly journey to and from the Sabaki, which accounts for the\nthousands of animal paths leading from the plateau to the river.\n\nBy this time we were all beginning to feel very tired, and the bhisti's\nstock of water was running low. I therefore climbed the highest tree I\ncould find in order to have a good look round, but absolutely nothing\ncould I see in any direction but the same flat thorny wilderness,\ninterspersed here and there with a few green trees; not a landmark of\nany sort or kind as far as the eye could reach; a most hopeless,\nterrible place should one be lost in it, with certain death either by\nthirst or by savage beasts staring one in the face. Clearly, then, the\nonly thing to do was to return to the river; and in order to accomplish\nthis before dark it was necessary that no time should be lost. But we\nhad been winding in and out so much through the animal paths that it\nwas no easy matter to say in which direction the Sabaki lay. First I\nconsulted my Wa Kamba followers as to the route back, they simply shook\ntheir heads. Then I asked Mahina, who pointed out a direction exactly\nopposite to that which I felt confident was the right one. Mabruki, of\ncourse, knew nothing, but volunteered the helpful and cheering\ninformation that we were lost and would all be killed by lions. In\nthese circumstances, I confirmed my own idea as to our way by comparing\nmy watch and the sun, and gave the order to start at once. For two\nsolid hours, however, we trudged along in the fearful heat without\nstriking a single familiar object or landmark. Mabruki murmured loudly;\neven Mahina expressed grave doubts as to whether the \"Sahib\" had taken\nthe right direction; only the Wa Kamba stalked along in reassuring\nsilence. For some time we had been following a broad white rhino path,\nand the great footmarks, of one of these beasts were fresh and plainly\nvisible in the dust. He had been travelling in the opposite direction\nto us, and I felt sure that he must have been returning from drinking\nin the river. I accordingly insisted on our keeping to this path, and\nvery soon, to my great relief, we found that we were at the edge of the\nescarpment, a couple of miles away from the place where we had made the\nascent. Here a halt was called; a sheet was spread over some of the\nstunted trees, and under its shade we rested for half an hour, had some\nfood, and drank the last of our water. After this we pushed on with\nrenewed vigour, and arrived at the Sabaki in good time before sundown,\nhaving bagged a couple of guinea-fowl and a paa on the way to serve for\ndinner. After the long and fatiguing day my bathe in a clear shady pool\nwas a real delight, but I might not have enjoyed it quite so much if I\nhad known then of the terrible fate which awaited one of my followers\nin the same river the next day. By the time I got back to camp supper\nwas ready and fully appreciated. The tireless Mahina had also collected\nsome dry grass for my bed, and I turned in at once, with my rifle\nhandy, and slept the sleep of the just, regardless of all the wild\nbeasts in Africa.\n\nAt dawn Mabruki roused me with a cup of steaming hot coffee and some\nbiscuits, and a start was at once made on our return journey to Tsavo.\nThe place where we had struck the Sabaki the previous evening was some\nmiles further down the stream than I had ever been before, so I decided\nto take advantage of the Masai trail along its bank until the Tsavo\nRiver was reached. I did not think we should meet with any further\nadventure on our way home, but in the wilds the unexpected is always\nhappening. Shortly after we started one of the Wa Kamba went down to\nthe river's edge to fill his calabash with water, when a crocodile\nsuddenly rose up out of the stream, seized the poor fellow and in a\nmoment had dragged him in. I was on ahead at the time and so did not\nwitness the occurrence, but on hearing the cries of the others I ran\nback as quickly as possible--too late, however, to see any sign of\neither crocodile or native. Mahina philosophically remarked that after\nall it was only a washenzi (savage), whose loss did not much matter;\nand the other three Wa Kamba certainly did not appear to be affected by\nthe incident, but calmly possessed themselves of their dead companion's\nbow and quiver of poisoned arrows, and of the stock of meat which he\nhad left on the bank.\n\nI have since learned that accidents of this kind are of fairly frequent\noccurrence along the banks of these rivers. On one occasion while I was\nin the country a British officer had a very lucky escape. He was\nfilling his water bottle at the river, when one of these brutes caught\nhim by the hand and attempted to draw him in.  Fortunately one of his\nservants rushed to his assistance and managed to pull him out of the\ncrocodile's clutches with the loss only of two of his fingers.\n\nAs we made our way up the Sabaki, we discovered a beautiful waterfall\nabout a hundred and fifty feet high--not a sheer drop, but a series of\ncascades. At this time the river was in low water, and the falls\nconsequently did not look their best; but in flood time they form a\nfine sight, and the thunder of the falling water can then be plainly\nheard at Tsavo, over seven miles away, when the wind is in the right\ndirection. We crossed the river on the rocks at the head of these\nfalls, and after some hours' hard marching reached camp without further\nincident.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE FINDING OF THE MAN-EATERS' DEN\n\n\nThere were some rocky-looking hills lying to the south-west of Tsavo\nwhich I was particularly anxious to explore, so on one occasion when\nwork had been stopped for the day owing to lack of material, I set off\nfor them, accompanied by Mahina and a Punjaubi coolie, who was so stout\nthat he went by the name of Moota (i.e. \"Fattie\"). In the course of my\nlittle excursions round Tsavo I gradually discovered that I was nearly\nalways able to make my way to any required point of the compass by\nfollowing certain well-defined animal paths, which I mapped out bit by\nbit during my explorations. On this occasion, for instance, as soon as\nwe had crossed the river and had struck into the jungle, we were\nfortunate enough to find a rhino path leading in the right direction,\nwhich greatly facilitated our progress. As we were making our way along\nthis path through the dry bed of a nullah, I happened to notice that\nthe sandy bottom sparkled here and there where the sunbeams penetrated\nthe dense foliage. This at once filled my head with thoughts of\nprecious stones, and as the spot looked likely enough, I started to dig\nvigorously at the gravel with my hunting knife. After a few minutes of\nthis work, I came across what I at first took to be a magnificent\ndiamond sparkling in the damp sand: it was about half an inch long, and\nits facets looked as if they had been cut by an Amsterdam expert. I\ntested the stone on my watch glass and found that it cut my initials\nquite easily, and though I knew that quartz would do this as well, it\ndid not seem to me to have either the general appearance or angles of\nany quartz I had ever seen. For a moment or two I was greatly delighted\nwith my discovery, and began to have rosy dreams of a diamond mine; but\nI am sorry to say that on closer examination and testing I was forced\nto the conclusion that my find was not a diamond, though unlike any\nother mineral I had ever come across.\n\nMy hopes of rapidly becoming a millionaire having thus been dashed to\nthe ground, we proceeded on our way, getting further and further into\nthe depths of a gloomy forest. A little distance on, I noticed through\na break in the trees a huge rhino standing in full view near the edge\nof a ravine. Unfortunately he caught sight of us as well, and before I\ncould take aim, he snorted loudly and crashed off through the tangled\nundergrowth. As I followed up this ravine, walking stealthily along in\nthe delightful shade of the overhanging palms, I observed on my left a\nlittle nullah which opened out of the main channel through a confused\nmass of jungle and creeper. Through this tangle there was a\nwell-defined archway, doubtless made by the regular passage of rhino\nand hippo, so I decided to enter and explore what lay beyond. I had not\ngone very far when I came upon a big bay scooped out of the bank by the\nstream when in flood and carpeted with a deposit of fine, soft sand, in\nwhich were the indistinct tracks of numberless animals. In one corner\nof this bay, close under an overhanging tree, stood a little sandy\nhillock, and on looking over the top of this I saw on the other side a\nfearsome-looking cave which seemed to run back for a considerable\ndistance under the rocky bank. Round the entrance and inside the cavern\nI was thunderstruck to find a number of human bones, with here and\nthere a copper bangle such as the natives wear. Beyond all doubt, the\nman-eaters' den! In this manner, and quite by accident, I stumbled upon\nthe lair of these once-dreaded \"demons\", which I had spent so many days\nsearching for through the exasperating and interminable jungle during\nthe time when they terrorised Tsavo. I had no inclination to explore\nthe gloomy depths of the interior, but thinking that there might\npossibly still be a lioness or cub inside, I fired a shot or two into\nthe cavern through a hole in the roof. Save for a swarm of bats,\nnothing came out; and after taking a photograph of the cave, I gladly\nleft the horrible spot, thankful that the savage and insatiable brutes\nwhich once inhabited it were no longer at large.\n\nRetracing my steps to the main ravine, I continued my journey along it.\nAfter a little while I fancied I saw a hippo among some tall rushes\ngrowing on the bank, and quickly signed to Mahina and Moota to stay\nperfectly still. I then made a careful stalk, only to discover, after\nall my trouble, that my eyes had deceived me and made me imagine a\nblack bank and a few rushes to be a living animal. We now left the bed\nof the ravine, and advanced along the top. This turned out to be a good\nmove, for soon we heard the galloping of a herd of some animal or other\nacross our front. I rushed round a corner in the path a few yards\nahead, and crouching under the bushes saw a line of startled zebras\nflying past. This was the first time I had seen these beautifully\nmarked animals in their wild state, so I selected the largest and\nfired, and as I was quite close to them he dropped in his tracks\nstone-dead. When I stood over the handsome creature I was positively\nsorry for having killed him. Not so Moota, however, who rushed up in\necstasy, and before I could stop him had cut his throat. This was done,\nas he remarked, \"to make the meat lawful,\" for Moota was a devout\nfollower of the Prophet, and no true Mohammedan will eat the flesh of\nany animal unless the throat has been cut at the proper place and the\nblood allowed to flow. This custom has often caused me great annoyance,\nfor Mohammedan followers rush in so quickly when an animal is shot and\ncut the head off so short that it is afterwards quite useless as a\ntrophy.\n\nBy the time the zebra was skinned, darkness was fast approaching, so we\nselected a suitable tree in which to pass the night. Under it we built\na goodly fire, made some tea, and roasted a couple of quails which I\nhad shot early in the day and which proved simply delicious. We then\nbetook ourselves to the branches--at least, Mahina and I did; Moota was\nafraid of nothing, and said he would sleep on the ground. He was not so\nfull of courage later on, however, for about midnight a great rhino\npassed our way, winded us and snorted so loudly that Moota scrambled in\nabject terror up our tree. He was as nimble as a monkey for all his\nstoutness, and never ceased climbing until he was far above us. We both\nlaughed heartily at his extraordinary haste to get out of danger, and\nMahina chaffed him unmercifully.\n\nThe rest of the night passed without incident, and in the early\nmorning, while the boys were preparing breakfast, I strolled off\ntowards the rocky hills which I had seen from Tsavo, and which were now\nonly about half a mile distant. I kept a sharp look-out for game, but\ncame across nothing save here and there a paa and a few guinea-fowl,\nuntil, just as I was about half-way round the hill, I saw a fine\nleopard lying on a rocky ledge basking in the morning sun. But he was\ntoo quick for me, and made off before I could get a shot; I had not\napproached noiselessly enough, and a leopard is too wary a beast to be\ncaught napping. Unfortunately I had no more time at my disposal in\nwhich to explore these hills, as I was anxious to resume work at Tsavo\nas soon as possible; so after breakfast we packed up the zebra skin and\nbegan to retrace our steps through the jungle. It was an intensely hot\nday, and we were all very glad when at length we reached the home camp.\n\nMost of my little trips of this sort, however, were made in a northerly\ndirection, towards the ever-interesting Athi or Sabaki rivers. After a\nlong and tiring walk through the jungle what a pleasure it was to lie\nup in the friendly shelter of the rushes which line the banks, and\nwatch the animals come down to drink, all unconscious of my presence. I\ntook several photographs of scenes of this kind, but unfortunately many\nof the negatives were spoiled. Often, too, on a brilliant moonlight\nnight have I sat on a rock out in the middle of the stream, near a\nfavourite drinking place, waiting for a shot at whatever fortune might\nsend my way. How exasperating it was, when the wind changed at the\ncritical moment, and gave me away to the rhino or other animal I had\nsat there for hours patiently awaiting! Occasionally I would get\nheartily tired of my weary vigil and would wade ashore through the warm\nwater, to make my bed in the soft sand regardless of the snap, snap of\nthe crocodiles which could plainly be heard from the deeper pools up\nand down the river. At the time, being new to the country, I did not\nrealise the risks I ran; but later on--after my poor Wa Kamba follower\nhad been seized and dragged under, as I have already described--I\nlearned to be much more cautious.\n\nThe shortest way of reaching the Athi river from Tsavo was to strike\nthrough the jungle in a north-westerly direction, and here there was\nluckily a particularly well-defined rhino path which I always made use\nof. I discovered it quite by accident on one occasion when I had asked\nsome guests, who were staying with me at Tsavo, to spend a night on the\nbanks of the river. As we were making our way slowly and painfully\nthrough the dense jungle, I came across this well-trodden path, which\nappeared to lead in the direction in which I wished to go, and as I\nfelt convinced that at any rate it would bring us to the river\nsomewhere, I followed it with confidence. Our progress was now easy,\nand the track led through fairly open glades where traces of bush-buck\nand water-buck were numerous; indeed once or twice we caught glimpses\nof these animals as they bounded away to the shelter of the thicket,\nwarned by the sound of our approach. In the end, as I anticipated, the\nold rhino path proved a true guide, for it struck the Athi at an ideal\nspot for a camping ground, where some lofty trees close to the bank of\nthe river gave a most grateful and refreshing shade. We had a\ndelightful picnic, and my guests greatly enjoyed their night in the\nopen, although one of them got rather a bad fright from a rhino which\nsuddenly snorted close to our camp, evidently very annoyed at our\nintrusion on his domain.\n\nIn the morning they went off as soon as it was light to try their luck\nalong the river, while I remained in camp to see to breakfast. After an\nhour or more, however, they all returned, empty-handed but very hungry;\nso when they had settled down to rest after a hearty meal, I thought I\nwould sally forth and see if I could not meet with better success. I\nhad gone only a short distance up the right bank of the river, when I\nthought I observed a movement among the bushes ahead of me. On the\nalert, I stopped instantly, and the next moment was rewarded by seeing\na splendid bush-buck advance from the water in a most stately manner. I\ncould only make out his head and neck above the undergrowth, but as he\nwas only some fifty yards off, I raised my rifle to my shoulder to\nfire. This movement at once caught his eye, and for the fraction of a\nsecond he stopped to gaze at me, thus giving me time to aim at where I\nsupposed his shoulder to be. When I fired, he disappeared so suddenly\nand so completely that I felt sure that I had missed him, and that he\nhad made off through the bush. I therefore re-loaded, and advanced\ncarefully with the intention of following up his trail; but to my\nunbounded delight I came upon the buck stretched out dead in his\ntracks, with my bullet through his heart. I lost no time in getting\nback to camp, the antelope swinging by his feet from a branch borne by\ntwo sturdy coolies: and my unlucky friends were very much astonished\nwhen they saw the fine bag I had secured in so short a time. The animal\nwas soon skinned and furnished us with a delicious roast for lunch; and\nin the cool of the evening we made our way back to Tsavo without\nfurther adventure.\n\nSome little time after this, while one of these same friends (Mr. C.\nRawson) happened to be again at Tsavo, we were sitting after dark under\nthe verandah of my hut. I wanted something from my tent, and sent\nMeeanh, my Indian chaukidar, to fetch it. He was going off in the dark\nto do so, when I called him back and told him to take a lantern for\nfear of snakes. This he did, and as soon as he got to the door of the\ntent, which was only a dozen yards off, he called out frantically,\n\"Are, Sahib, burra sanp hai!\" (\"Oh, Master, there is a big snake here!)\n\n\"Where?\" I shouted.\n\n\"Here by the bed,\" he cried, \"Bring the gun, quickly.\"\n\nI seized the shot-gun, which I always kept handy, and rushed to the\ntent, where, by the light of the lantern, I saw a great red snake,\nabout seven feet long, gazing at me from the side of my camp-bed. I\ninstantly fired at him, cutting him clean in half with the shot; the\ntail part remained where it was, but the head half quickly wriggled off\nand disappeared in the gloom of the tent. The trail of blood, however,\nenabled us to track it, and we eventually found the snake, still full\nof fight, under the edge of the ground-sheet. He made a last vicious\ndart at one of the men who had run up, but was quickly given the happy\ndespatch by a blow on the head. Rawson now picked it up and brought it\nto the light. He then put his foot on the back of its head and with a\nstick forced open the jaws, when suddenly we saw two perfectly clear\njets of poison spurt out from the fangs. An Indian baboo (clerk), who\nhappened to be standing near, got the full benefit of this, and the\npoor man was so panic-stricken that in a second he had torn off every\natom of his clothing. We were very much amused at this, as of course we\nknew that although the poison was exceedingly venomous, it could do no\nharm unless it penetrated a cut or open wound in the flesh. I never\nfound out the name of this snake, which, as I have said, was of a dark\nbrick-red colour all over; and I only saw one other of the same kind\nall the time I was in East Africa. I came upon it suddenly one day when\nout shooting. It was evidently much startled, and stood erect, hissing\nvenomously; but I also was so much taken aback at its appearance that I\ndid not think about shooting it until it had glided off and disappeared\nin the thick undergrowth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nUNSUCCESSFUL RHINO HUNTS\n\n\nAlthough the jungle round Tsavo was a network of rhino paths I had\nnever so far been successful in my efforts to obtain one of these\nanimals, nor was my ambition yet to be realised. One day I was out\nexploring in the dense bush some six or seven miles away from camp, and\nfound my progress more than usually slow, owing to the fact that I had\nto spend most of my time crawling on all-fours through the jungle. I\nwas very pleased, therefore, to emerge suddenly on a broad and\nwell-beaten track along which I could walk comfortably in an upright\nposition. In this were some fresh rhino footprints which seemed barely\nan hour old, so I determined to follow them up. The roadway was beaten\nin places into a fine white dust by the passage of many heavy animals;\nand as I pushed cautiously forward I fully expected to come face to\nface with a rhino at every corner I turned. After having gone a little\nway I fancied that I really did see one lying at the foot of a tree\nsome distance ahead of me, but on approaching cautiously found that it\nwas nothing more than a great brown heap of loose earth which one of\nthe huge beasts had raised by rolling about on the soft ground. This,\nhowever, was evidently a resting-place which was regularly used, so I\nmade up my mind to spend a night in the overhanging branches of the\ntree.\n\nThe next afternoon, accordingly, Mahina and I made our way back to the\nplace, and by dusk we were safely but uncomfortably perched among the\nbranches directly over the path. We had scarcely been there an hour\nwhen to our delight we heard a great rhino plodding along the track in\nour direction. Unfortunately the moon had not yet risen, so I was\nunable to catch sight of the monster as he approached; I knew, however,\nthat there was light enough for me to see him when he emerged from the\nbushes into the little clearing round the foot of our tree. Nearer and\nnearer we heard him coming steadily on, and I had my rifle ready,\npointing it in the direction in which I expected his head to appear.\nBut, alas, just at that moment the wind veered round and blew straight\nfrom us towards the rhino, who scented us immediately, gave a mighty\nsnort and then dived madly away through the jungle. For some\nconsiderable time we could hear him crashing ponderously through\neverything that came in his way, and he must have gone a long distance\nbefore he recovered from his fright and slowed down to his usual pace.\nAt any rate we neither heard nor saw anything more of him, and spent a\nwakeful and uncomfortable night for nothing.\n\nMy next attempt to bag a rhino took place some months later, on the\nbanks of the Sabaki, and was scarcely more successful. I had come down\nfrom Tsavo in the afternoon, accompanied by Mahina, and finding a\nlikely tree, within a few yards of the river and with fresh footprints\nunder it, I at once decided to take up my position for the night in its\nbranches. Mahina preferred to sit where he could take a comfortable\nnap, and wedged himself in a fork of the tree some little way below me,\nbut still some eight or ten feet from the ground. It was a calm and\nperfect night, such as can be seen only in the tropics; everything\nlooked mysteriously beautiful in the glorious moonlight, and stood out\nlike a picture looked at through a stereoscope. From my perch among the\nbranches I watched first a water-buck come to drink in the river; then\na bush-buck; later, a tiny paa emerged from the bushes and paused at\nevery step with one graceful forefoot poised in the air--thoroughly on\nthe alert and looking round carefully and nervously for any trace of a\npossible enemy. At length it reached the brink of the river in safety,\nand stooped to drink. Just then I saw a jackal come up on its trail and\nbegin carefully to stalk it, not even rustling a fallen leaf in its\nstealthy advance on the poor little antelope. All of a sudden, however,\nthe jackal stopped dead for a second, and then made off out of sight as\nfast as ever he could go. I looked round to discover the cause of this\nhurried exit, and to my surprise saw a large and very beautiful leopard\ncrouching down and moving noiselessly in the direction of our tree. At\nfirst I thought it must be stalking some animal on the ground below us,\nbut I soon realised that it was Mahina that the brute was intent on.\nWhether, if left to himself, the leopard would actually have made a\nspring at my sleeping gun-bearer, I do not know; but I had no intention\nof letting him have a chance of even attempting this, so I cautiously\nraised my rifle and levelled it at him. Absolutely noiseless as I was\nin doing this, he noticed it--possibly a glint of moonlight on the\nbarrel caught his eye--and immediately disappeared into the bush before\nI could get in a shot. I at once woke Mahina and made him come up to\nmore secure quarters beside me.\n\nFor a long time after this nothing disturbed our peace, but at last the\nquarry I had hoped for made his appearance on the scene. Just below us\nthere was an opening in the elephant grass which lined the river's\nedge, and through this the broad stream shone like silver in the\nmoonlight. Without warning this gap was suddenly filled by a huge black\nmass--a rhino making his way, very leisurely, out of the shallow water.\nOn he came with a slow, ponderous tread, combining a certain\nstateliness with his awkward strides. Almost directly beneath us he\nhalted and stood for an instant clearly exposed to our view. This was\nmy opportunity; I took careful aim at his shoulder and fired.\nInstantly, and with extraordinary rapidity, the huge beast whirled\nround like a peg-top, whereupon I fired again. This time I expected him\nto fall; but instead of that I had the mortification of seeing him rush\noff into the jungle and of hearing him crash through it like a great\nsteam-roller for several minutes. I consoled myself by thinking that he\ncould not go far, as he was hard hit, and that I should easily find him\nwhen daylight arrived. Mahina, who was in a wild state of excitement\nover the burra janwar (great animal), was also of this opinion, and as\nthere was no longer any reason for silence, he chatted to me about many\nstrange and curious things until the grey dawn appeared. When we got\ndown from our perch, we found the track of the wounded rhino clearly\nmarked by great splashes of blood, and for a couple of miles the spoor\ncould thus be easily followed. At length, however, it got fainter and\nfainter, and finally ceased altogether, so that we had to abandon the\nsearch; the ground round about was rocky, and there was no possibility\nof telling which way our quarry had gone. I was exceedingly sorry for\nthis, as I did not like to leave him wounded; but there was no help for\nit, so we struck out for home and arrived at Tsavo in the afternoon\nvery tired, hungry and disappointed.\n\nRhinos are extraordinary animals, and not in any way to be depended\nupon. One day they will sheer off on meeting a human being and make no\nattempt to attack; the next day, for no apparent reason, they may\nexecute a most determined charge. I was told for a fact by an official\nwho had been long in the country that on one occasion while a gang of\ntwenty-one slaves, chained neck to neck as was the custom, was being\nsmuggled down to the coast and was proceeding in Indian file along a\nnarrow path, a rhinoceros suddenly charged out at right angles to them,\nimpaled the centre man on its horns and broke the necks of the\nremainder of the party by the suddenness of his rush. These huge beasts\nhave a very keen sense of smell, but equally indifferent eyesight, and\nit is said that if a hunter will only stand perfectly still on meeting\na rhino, it will pass him by without attempting to molest him. I feel\nbound to add, however, that I have so far failed to come across anybody\nwho has actually tried the experiment. On the other hand, I have met\none or two men who have been tossed on the horns of these animals, and\nthey described it as a very painful proceeding. It generally means\nbeing a cripple for life, if one even succeeds in escaping death. Mr.\nB. Eastwood, the chief accountant of the Uganda Railway, once gave me a\ngraphic description of his marvellous escape from an infuriated rhino.\nHe was on leave at the time on a hunting expedition in the\nneighbourhood of Lake Baringo, about eighty miles north of the railway\nfrom Nakuru, and had shot and apparently killed a rhino. On walking up\nto it, however, the brute rose to its feet and literally fell on him,\nbreaking four ribs and his right arm. Not content with this, it then\nstuck its horn through his thigh and tossed him over its back,\nrepeating this operation once or twice. Finally, it lumbered off,\nleaving poor Eastwood helpless and fainting in the long grass where he\nhad fallen. He was alone at the time, and it was not for some hours\nthat he was found by his porters, who were only attracted to the spot\nby the numbers of vultures hovering about, waiting in their ghoulish\nmanner for life to be extinct before beginning their meal. How he\nmanaged to live for the eight days after this which elapsed before a\ndoctor could be got to him I cannot imagine; but in the end he\nfortunately made a good recovery, the only sign of his terrible\nexperience being the absence of his right arm, which had to be\namputated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA WIDOW'S STORY\n\n\nVery shortly before I left Tsavo I went (on March 11, 1899) on\ninspection duty to Voi, which, as I have already mentioned, is about\nthirty miles on the Mombasa side of Tsavo. At this time it was a\nmiserable, swampy spot, where fever, guinea-worm, and all kinds of\nhorrible diseases were rampant; but this state of affairs has now been\ncompletely altered by drainage and by clearing away the jungle. Dr.\nRose was in medical charge of the place at the time of my visit, and as\nit was the good old custom to put up with any friend one came across\ntowards nightfall, I made him my host when my day's work was over. We\nspent a very pleasant evening together, and naturally discussed all the\nlocal news. Amongst other things we chatted about the new road which\nwas being constructed from Voi to a rather important missionary station\ncalled Taveta, near Mount Kilima N'jaro, and Dr. Rose mentioned that\nMr. O'Hara (the engineer in charge of the road-making), with his wife\nand children, was encamped in the Wa Taita country, about twelve miles\naway from Voi.\n\nEarly next morning I went out for a stroll with my shot-gun, but had\nnot gone far from the doctor's tent when I saw in the distance four\nSwahili carrying something which looked like a stretcher along the\nnewly-made road. Fearing that some accident had happened, I went\nquickly to meet them and called out to ask what they were carrying.\nThey shouted back \"Bwana\" (\"The master\"); and when I asked what bwana,\nthey replied \"Bwana O'Hara.\" On enquiring what exactly had happened,\nthey told me that during the night their master had been killed by a\nlion, and that his wife and children were following behind, along the\nroad. At this I directed the men to the hospital and told them where to\nfind Dr. Rose, and without waiting to hear any further particulars\nhurried on as fast as possible to give what assistance I could to poor\nMrs. O'Hara. Some considerable way back I met her toiling along with an\ninfant in her arms, while a little child held on to her skirt, utterly\ntired out with the long walk. I helped her to finish the distance to\nthe doctor's tent; she was so unstrung by her terrible night's\nexperience and so exhausted by her trying march carrying the baby that\nshe was scarcely able to speak. Dr. Rose at once did all he could both\nfor her and for the children, the mother being given a sleeping draught\nand made comfortable in one of the tents. When she appeared again late\nin the afternoon she was much refreshed, and was able to tell us the\nfollowing dreadful story, which I shall give as nearly as possible in\nher own words.\n\n\"We were all asleep in the tent, my husband and I in one bed and my two\nchildren in another. The baby was feverish and restless, so I got up to\ngive her something to drink; and as I was doing so, I heard what I\nthought was a lion walking round the tent. I at once woke my husband\nand told him I felt sure there was a lion about. He jumped up and went\nout, taking his gun with him. He looked round the outside of the tent,\nand spoke to the Swahili askari who was on sentry by the camp fire a\nlittle distance off. The askari said he had seen nothing about except a\ndonkey, so my husband came in again, telling me not to worry as it was\nonly a donkey that I had heard.\n\n\"The night being very hot, my husband threw back the tent door and lay\ndown again beside me. After a while I dozed off, but was suddenly\nroused by a feeling as if the pillow were being pulled away from under\nmy head. On looking round I found that my husband was gone. I jumped up\nand called him loudly, but got no answer. Just then I heard a noise\namong the boxes outside the door, so I rushed out and saw my poor\nhusband lying between the boxes. I ran up to him and tried to lift him,\nbut found I could not do so. I then called to the askari to come and\nhelp me, but he refused, saying that there was a lion standing beside\nme. I looked up and saw the huge beast glowering at me, not more than\ntwo yards away. At this moment the askari fired his rifle, and this\nfortunately frightened the lion, for it at once jumped off into the\nbush.\n\n\"All four askaris then came forward and lifted my husband back on to\nthe bed. He was quite dead. We had hardly got back into the tent before\nthe lion returned and prowled about in front of the door, showing every\nintention of springing in to recover his prey. The askaris fired at\nhim, but did no damage beyond frightening him away again for a moment\nor two. He soon came back and continued to walk round the tent until\ndaylight, growling and purring, and it was only by firing through the\ntent every now and then that we kept him out. At daybreak he\ndisappeared and I had my husband's body carried here, while I followed\nwith the children until I met you.\"\n\nSuch was Mrs. O'Hara's pitiful story. The only comfort we could give\nher was to assure her that her husband had died instantly and without\npain; for while she had been resting Dr. Rose had made a post-mortem\nexamination of the body and had come to this conclusion. He found that\nO'Hara had evidently been lying on his back at the time, and that the\nlion, seizing his head in its mouth, had closed its long tusks through\nhis temples until they met again in the brain. We buried him before\nnightfall in a peaceful spot close by, the doctor reading the funeral\nservice, while I assisted in lowering the rude coffin into the grave.\nIt was the saddest scene imaginable. The weeping widow, the wondering\nfaces of the children, the gathering gloom of the closing evening, the\ndusky forms of a few natives who had gathered round--all combined to\nmake a most striking and solemn ending to a very terrible tragedy of\nreal life.\n\nI am glad to say that within a few weeks' time the lion that was\nresponsible for this tragedy was killed by a poisoned arrow, shot from\na tree top by one of the Wa Taita.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAN INFURIATED RHINO\n\n\nMy work at Tsavo was finished in March, 1899, when I received\ninstructions to proceed to railhead and take charge of a section of the\nwork there. For many reasons I was sorry to say good-bye to Tsavo,\nwhere I had spent an eventful year; but all the same I was very glad to\nbe given this new post, as I knew that there would be a great deal of\ninteresting work to be done and a constant change of camp and scene, as\nthe line progressed onward to the interior. In good spirits, therefore,\nI set out for my new headquarters on March 28. By this time railhead\nhad reached a place called Machakos Road, some two hundred and\nseventy-six miles from Mombasa and within a few miles of the great Athi\nPlains, the latter being treeless and waterless expanses, bare of\neverything except grass, which the great herds of game keep closely\ncropped. After leaving Tsavo, the character of the country remains\nunaltered for some considerable distance, the line continuing to run\nthrough the thorny nyika, and it is not until Makindu is reached--about\ntwo hundred miles from the coast--that a change is apparent. From this\nplace, however, the journey lies through a fairly open and interesting\ntract of country, where game of all kinds abounds and can be seen\ngrazing peacefully within a few hundred yards of the railway. On the\nway I was lucky enough to get some fine views of Kilima N'jaro, the\nwhole mountain from base to summit standing out clearly and grandly,\nwith the lofty peak of Kibo topping the fleecy clouds with its snowy\nhead.\n\nAt Machakos Road I found the country and the climate very different\nfrom that to which I had grown accustomed at Tsavo. Here I could see\nfor miles across stretches of beautiful, open downs, timbered here and\nthere like an English park; and it was a great relief to be able to\noverlook a wide tract of country and to feel that I was no longer\nhemmed in on all sides by the interminable and depressing thorny\nwilderness. As Machakos Road is some four thousand feet higher above\nthe sea level than Tsavo, the difference in temperature was also very\nmarked, and the air felt fresh and cool compared with that of the\nsun-baked valley in which I had spent the previous year.\n\nMy instructions were to hurry on the construction of the line as fast\nas possible to Nairobi, the proposed headquarters of the Railway\nAdministration, which lay about fifty miles further on across the Athi\nPlains; and I soon began to find platelaying most interesting work.\nEverything has to move as if by clockwork. First the earth surface has\nto be prepared and rendered perfectly smooth and level; cuttings have\nto be made and hollows banked up; tunnels have to be bored through\nhills and bridges thrown across rivers. Then a line of coolies moves\nalong, placing sleepers at regular intervals; another gang drops the\nrails in their places; yet another brings along the keys, fishplates,\nbolts and nuts while following these are the men who actually fix the\nrails on the sleepers and link up from one to another. Finally, the\npacking gang finishes the work by filling in earth and ballast under\nand around the steel sleepers to give them the necessary grip and\nrigidity. Some days we were able to lay only a few yards, while on\nother days we might do over a mile; all depended on the nature of the\ncountry we had to cover. On one occasion we succeeded in breaking the\nrecord for a day's platelaying, and were gratified at receiving a\ntelegram of congratulation from the Railway Committee at the Foreign\nOffice.\n\nI made it my custom to take a walk each morning for some distance ahead\nof rails along the centre-line of the railway, in order to spy out the\nland and to form a rough estimate of the material that would be\nrequired in the way of sleepers, girders for temporary bridges, etc. It\nwas necessary to do this in order to avoid undue delay taking place\nowing to shortage of material of any kind. About ten days after my\narrival at Machakos Road I walked in this way for five or six miles\nahead of the last-laid rail. It was rather unusual for me to go so far,\nand, as it happened, I was alone on this occasion, Mahina having been\nleft behind in camp. About two miles away on my left, I noticed a\ndark-looking object and thinking it was an ostrich I started off\ntowards it. Very soon, however, I found that it was bigger game than an\nostrich, and on getting still nearer made out the form of a great\nrhinoceros lying down. I continued to advance very cautiously,\nwriggling through the short grass until at length I got within fifty\nyards of where the huge beast was resting. Here I lay and watched him;\nbut after some little time he evidently suspected my presence, for\nrising to his feet, he looked straight in my direction and then\nproceeded to walk round me in a half-circle. The moment he got wind of\nme, he whipped round in his tracks like a cat and came for me in a\nbee-line. Hoping to turn him, I fired instantly; but unfortunately my\nsoft-nosed bullets merely annoyed him further, and had not the\nslightest effect on his thick hide. On seeing this, I flung myself down\nquite flat on the grass and threw my helmet some ten feet away in the\nhope that he would perceive it and vent his rage on it instead of me.\nOn he thundered, while I scarcely dared to breathe. I could hear him\nsnorting and rooting up the grass quite close to me, but luckily for me\nhe did not catch sight of me and charged by a few yards to my left.\n\nAs soon as he had passed me, my courage began to revive again, and I\ncould not resist the temptation of sending a couple of bullets after\nhim. These, however, simply cracked against his hide and splintered to\npieces on it, sending the dry mud off in little clouds of dust. Their\nonly real effect, indeed, was to make him still more angry. He stood\nstock-still for a moment, and then gored the ground most viciously and\nstarted off once more on the semi-circle round me. This proceeding\nterrified me more than ever, as I felt sure that he would come up-wind\nat me again, and I could scarcely hope to escape a second time.\nUnfortunately, my surmise proved correct, for directly he scented me,\nup went his nose in the air and down he charged like a battering-ram. I\nfairly pressed myself into the ground, as flat as ever I could, and\nluckily the grass was a few inches high. I felt the thud of his great\nfeet pounding along, yet dared not move or look up lest he should see\nme. My heart was thumping like a steam hammer, and every moment I fully\nexpected to find myself tossed into the air. Nearer and nearer came the\nheavy thudding and I had quite given myself up for lost, when from my\nlying position I caught sight, out of the corner of my eye, of the\ninfuriated beast rushing by. He had missed me again! I never felt so\nrelieved in my life, and assuredly did not attempt to annoy him\nfurther. He went off for good this time, and it was with great\nsatisfaction that I watched him gradually disappear in the distance. I\ncould not have believed it possible that these huge, ungainly-looking\nbrutes could move so rapidly, and turn and twist in their tracks just\nlike monkeys, had I not actually seen this one do so before my eyes. If\nhe had found me he would certainly have pounded me to atoms, as he was\nan old bull and in a most furious and vicious mood.\n\nOne day when Dr. Brock and I were out shooting, shortly after this\nincident and not far from where it occurred, we caught sight of two\nrhinos in a hollow some little distance from us, and commenced to stalk\nthem, taking advantage of every fold of the ground in doing so and\nkeeping about fifty yards apart in case of a charge. In that event one\nor other of us would be able to get in a broadside shot, which would\nprobably roll the beast over. Proceeding carefully in this manner, we\nmanaged to get within about sixty yards of them, and as it was my turn\nfor a shot, I took aim at the larger of the two, just as it was moving\nits great head from one side to the other, wondering which of us it\nought to attack. When at last it decided upon Brock, it gave me the\nchance I had been waiting for. I fired instantly at the hollow between\nneck and shoulder; the brute dropped at once, and save for one or two\nconvulsive kicks of its stumpy legs as it lay half on its back, it\nnever moved again. The second rhino proved to be a well-grown youngster\nwhich showed considerable fight as we attempted to approach its fallen\ncomrade. We did not want to kill it, and accordingly spent about two\nhours in shouting and throwing stones at it before at last we succeeded\nin driving it away. We then proceeded to skin our prize; this, as may\nbe imagined, proved rather a tough job, but we managed it in the end,\nand the trophy was well worth the pains I had taken to add it to my\ncollection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nLIONS ON THE ATHI PLAINS\n\n\nShortly after I took charge at railhead we entered the Kapiti Plain,\nwhich gradually merges into the Athi Plain, and, indeed, is hardly to\nbe distinguished from the latter in the appearance or general character\nof the country. Together they form a great tract of rolling downs\ncovered with grass, and intersected here and there by dry ravines,\nalong the baked banks of which a few stunted trees--the only ones to be\nseen--struggle to keep themselves alive. In all this expanse there is\nabsolutely no water in the dry season, except in the Athi River (some\nforty miles away) and in a few water-holes known only to the wild\nanimals. The great feature of the undulating plains, however, and the\none which gives them a never-failing interest, is the great abundance\nof game of almost every conceivable kind. Here I myself have seen lion,\nrhinoceros, leopard, eland, giraffe, zebra, wildebeeste, hartebeeste,\nwaterbuck, wart-hog, Granti, Thomsoni, impala, besides ostriches,\ngreater and lesser bustard, marabout, and a host of other animals and\nbirds too numerous to name; while along the Athi and close to its banks\nmay be found large numbers of hippo and crocodiles. At the time I was\nthere, these great plains also formed the principal grazing ground for\nthe immense herds of cattle owned by the Masai. I am very glad to say\nthat the whole of this country on the south side of the railway as far\nas the boundary of German East Africa, from the Tsavo River on the east\nto the Kedong Valley on the west, is now a strictly protected Game\nReserve; and so long, as this huge expanse is thus maintained as a\nsanctuary, there can be no danger of any of these species becoming\nextinct.\n\nWhile crossing this dry expanse, the greatest difficulty I had to\ncontend with was the provision of sufficient water for the three\nthousand workmen employed about railhead, for not a drop could be\nobtained on the way, nor could we hope for any until we had got to the\nother side of the plain and had reached the Athi River, which could not\nbe accomplished under a couple of months. As we progressed onwards into\nthe waterless belt, this became a very serious matter indeed, as any\nbreakdown in the supply would have had the most disastrous consequences\namong so large a body of men working all day under the blazing sun of a\ntropical climate. Every day two trainloads of water in great tanks were\nbrought up from the last stream we had passed, which, of course, daily\nfell further to the rear. This was a source of considerable delay, for\nthe line was blocked all the time the water was being pumped into the\ntanks, and consequently no material for construction could come\nthrough; and a good deal of time was also wasted, when the trains\nreturned to railhead, in distributing the water to the workmen, who\noften quarrelled and fought in their eagerness to get at it. At first I\nhad most of the tank-filling done by night, but on one occasion a lion\ncame unpleasantly close to the men working the pump, and so night work\nhad to be abandoned. The coolies themselves were so anxious, indeed, to\nget a plentiful supply of water, that once or twice some of the more\ndaring spirits among them ventured to go out on to the plains in search\nof waterholes, which, by reason of the large herds of game, we knew\nmust exist somewhere. The only result of these expeditions, however,\nwas that three of these men never returned; what befell them is not\nknown to this day.\n\nWhen we had proceeded some distance across this dry land, and when I\nwas experiencing to the full the disadvantage and delay caused by my\ntank trains, a native from some remote corner of the plains--with\nnothing by way of dress but a small piece of cowhide thrown over his\nleft shoulder--came to my tent door one day and squatted down on his\nheels in the native fashion. On being asked his business, \"I have\nheard,\" he replied, \"that the Great Master wants water; I can show it\nto him.\" This was good news, if it could be relied upon; so I\nquestioned him closely, and ascertained that some time\npreviously--exactly how long ago I could not gather--he had been in the\nlocality on a raiding expedition and had succeeded in finding water. I\nasked if the place was far away, and got the reply in Swahili \"M'bali\nkidogo\" (\"A little distance\"). Now, I had had experience of M'bali\nkidogo before; it is like the Irishman's \"mile and a bit.\" So I decided\nto start very early next morning on a search for this pond--for such my\ninformant described it to be. In the meantime the poor fellow, who\nappeared starving--there was a sore famine among the natives of the\ndistrict at the time--was given food and drink, and made a ravenous\nmeal. In the evening I had a long talk with him in broken Swahili round\nthe camp fire, and obtained some insight into many of the strange and\nbarbarous customs of the Masai, to which interesting tribe he belonged.\n\nIn the morning I started off betimes, taking my .303 rifle and being\naccompanied by Mahina with the 12-bore shot-gun, and by another Indian\ncarrying the necessary food and water. Our Masai guide, whose name we\nfound to be Lungow, seemed to be quite certain of his way, and led us\nacross the rolling plains more or less in the direction in which the\nrailway was to run, but some miles to the right of its centre-line. The\nmarch was full of interest, for on the way we passed within easy range\nof herds of wildebeeste, hartebeeste, gazelle, and zebra. I was out\nstrictly on business, however, and did not attempt a shot, reserving\nthat pleasure for the homeward trip. Late in the forenoon we arrived at\nLungow's pond--a circular dip about eighty yards in diameter, which\nwithout doubt had contained water very recently, but which, as I\nexpected to find, was now quite dry. A considerable number of bones lay\nscattered round it, whether of \"kills\" or of animals which had died of\nthirst I could not say. Our guide appeared very much upset when he\nfound the pond empty, and gave vent to many exclamations in his\npeculiar language, in which the letter \"r\" rolled like a kettledrum.\n\nOur search for water having thus proved a failure, I determined to try\nmy luck with the game. The Masai and the Indian were sent back to camp,\nwhile Mahina and I made a big detour from the dried-up water-hole. Game\nabounded in all directions, but the animals were much more shy than\nthey had been in the morning, and it was in vain that I stalked--if it\ncan be called \"stalking,\" when as a matter of fact one has to move in\nthe open--splendid specimens of Thomson's and Grant's gazelle. I might\nhave attempted a shot once or twice, but the probability was that owing\nto the long range it would have resulted only in a wound, and I think\nthere is nothing so painful as to see an animal limping about in a\ncrippled condition. In this fruitless manner we covered several miles,\nand I was beginning to think that we should have to return to camp\nwithout so much as firing a shot. Just then, however, I saw a herd of\nwildebeeste, and with much care managed to get within three hundred\nyards of them. I singled out the biggest head and waiting for a\nfavourable moment, fired at him, dropping him at once. I ran up to the\nfallen beast, which appeared to be dying, and told Mahina to drive the\nhunting knife right through his heart so as to put him quickly out of\nall pain. As Mahina was not doing this as skilfully or as quickly as I\nthought it might be done, and seemed unable to pierce the tough hide, I\nhanded him my rifle and took the knife in order to do it myself. Just\nas I raised the knife to strike, I was startled by the wildebeeste\nsuddenly jumping to his feet. For a moment he stood looking at me in a\ndazed and tottery kind of way, and then to my amazement he turned and\nmade off. At first he moved with such a shaky and uncertain gait that I\nfelt confident that he could only go a few yards before dropping; so,\nas I did not wish to disturb the other game around us by firing a\nsecond shot, I thought it best just to wait. To my utter astonishment,\nhowever, after he had staggered for about sixty yards he seemed to\nrevive suddenly, broke into his ordinary gallop and quickly rejoined\nthe herd. From that time I lost all trace of him, though I followed up\nfor four or five miles.\n\nThe wildebeeste, in fact, is like Kipling's Fuzzy-Wuzzy--\"'e's\ngenerally shammin' when 'e's dead\"; and my friend Rawson about this\ntime had an experience very similar to mine, but attended with more\nserious results. He had knocked his wildebeeste over in much the same\nway, and thought it was dead; and as he was very keen on obtaining\nphotographs of game, he took his stand-camera from the Indian who\ncarried it and proceeded to focus it on the animal's head. When he was\njust about to take the picture, he was thunderstruck to see the\nwildebeeste jump up and come charging down upon him. He sprang quickly\naside, and in an instant up went the camera into the air, followed the\nnext moment by the unfortunate Indian, the wildebeeste having stuck its\nhorn right through the man's thigh and tossed him over its back.\nFortunately the brute fell dead after this final effort, leaving Rawson\ngrateful for his escape.\n\nAfter abandoning the chase of my wildebeeste, we had not gone far on\nour way towards the home camp when I thought I observed something of a\nreddish colour moving in a patch of long grass, a good distance to our\nleft front. I asked Mahina if he could make out what it was, but he was\nunable to do so, and before I could get my field-glasses to bear, the\nanimal, whatever it was, had disappeared into the grass. I kept my eye\non the spot, however, and we gradually approached it. When we were\nabout a hundred yards off, the reddish object again appeared; and I saw\nthat it was nothing less than the shaggy head of a lion peeping over\nthe long grass. This time Mahina also saw what it was, and called out,\n\"Dekko, Sahib, sher!\" (\"Look, Master, a lion!\"). I whispered to him to\nbe quiet and to take no notice of him, while I tried my best to follow\nmy own advice. So we kept on, edging up towards the beast, but\napparently oblivious of his presence, as he lay there grimly watching\nus. As we drew nearer, I asked Mahina in a whisper if he felt equal to\nfacing a charge from the sher if I should wound him. He answered simply\nthat where I went, there would he go also; and right well he kept his\nword.\n\nI watched the lion carefully out of the corner of my eye as we closed\nin. Every now and then he would disappear from view for a moment; and\nit was a fascinating sight to see how he slowly raised his massive head\nabove the top of the grass again and gazed calmly and steadily at us as\nwe neared him. Unfortunately I could not distinguish the outline of his\nbody, hidden as it was in the grassy thicket. I therefore circled\ncautiously round in order to see if the cover was sufficiently thin at\nthe back to make a shoulder shot possible; but as we moved, the lion\nalso twisted round and so always kept his head full on us. When I had\ndescribed a half-circle, I found that the grass was no thinner and that\nmy chances of a shot had not improved. We were now within seventy yards\nof the lion, who appeared to take the greater interest in us the closer\nwe approached. He had lost the sleepy look with which he had at first\nregarded us, and was now fully on the alert; but still he did not give\nme the impression that he meant to charge, and no doubt if we had not\nprovoked him, he would have allowed us to depart in peace. I, however,\nwas bent on war, in spite of the risk which one must always run by\nattacking a lion at such close quarters on an open plain as flat as the\npalm of the hand; so in a standing position I took careful aim at his\nhead, and fired. The distance was, as I have said, a bare seventy\nyards; yet I must confess to a disgraceful miss. More astonishing\nstill, the beast made not the slightest movement--did not even blink an\neye, so far as I could see--but continued his steadfast, questioning\ngaze. Again I took aim, this time for a spot below the tip of his nose,\nand again I fired--with more success, the lion turning a complete\nsomersault over his tail. I thought he was done for, but he instantly\nsprang to his feet again, and to my horror and astonishment was joined\nby a lioness whose presence we had never even thought of or suspected.\n\nWorse was still to follow, for to our dismay both made a most\ndetermined charge on us, bounding along at a great pace and roaring\nangrily as they came. Poor Mahina cried out, \"Sahib, do sher ata hai!\"\n(\"Master, two lions are coming!\"), but I told him to stand stock-still\nand for his life not to make the slightest movement. In the twinkling\nof an eye the two beasts had covered about forty yards of the distance\ntowards us. As they did not show the least sign of stopping, I thought\nwe had given the experiment of remaining absolutely motionless a fair\ntrial, and was just about to raise the rifle to my shoulder as a last\nresort, when suddenly the wounded lion stopped, staggered, and fell to\nthe ground. The lioness took a couple of bounds nearer to us, and then\nto my unmeasured relief turned to look round for her mate, who had by\nthis time managed to get to his feet again. There they both stood,\ngrowling viciously and lashing their tails, for what appeared to me to\nbe a succession of ages. The lioness then made up her mind to go back\nto the lion, and they both stood broadside on, with their heads close\ntogether and turned towards us, snarling in a most aggressive manner.\nHad either of us moved hand or foot just then, it would, I am\nconvinced, have at once brought on another and probably a fatal charge.\n\nAs the two great brutes stood in this position looking at us, I had, of\ncourse, a grand opportunity of dropping both, but I confess I did not\nfeel equal to it at the moment. I could only devoutly hope that they\nwould not renew their attack, and was only too thankful to let them\ndepart in peace if they would, without any further hostility on my\npart. Just at this juncture the lion seemed to grow suddenly very weak.\nHe staggered some ten yards back towards his lair, and then fell to the\nground; the lioness followed, and lay down beside him--both still\nwatching us, and growling savagely. After a few seconds the lion\nstruggled to his feet again and retreated a little further, the lioness\naccompanying him until he fell once more. A third time the same thing\ntook place, and at last I began to breathe more freely, as they had now\nreached the thicket from which they had originally emerged. Accordingly\nI took a shot at the lioness as she lay beside her mate, partly\nconcealed in the long grass. I do not think I hit her, but anyhow she\nat once made off and bounded away at a great rate on emerging into the\nopen.\n\nI sent a few bullets after her to speed her on her way, and then\ncautiously approached the wounded lion. He was stretched out at full\nlength on his side, with his back towards me, but I could see by the\nheaving of his flanks that he was not yet dead, so I put a bullet\nthrough his spine. He never moved after this; but for safety's sake, I\nmade no attempt to go up to him for a few minutes, and then only after\nMahina had planted a few stones on his body just to make sure that he\nwas really dead.\n\nWe both felt very pleased with ourselves as we stood over him and\nlooked at his fine head, great paws, and long, clean, sharp tusks. He\nwas a young, but full-grown lion in fine condition, and measured nine\nfeet eight and a half inches from tip of nose to tip of tail. My last\nshot had entered the spine close to the shoulder, and had lodged in the\nbody; the first shot was a miss; as I have already said; but the second\nhad caught him on the forehead, right between the eyes. The bullet,\nhowever, instead of traversing the brain, had been turned downwards by\nthe frontal bone, through which it crashed, finally lodging in the root\nof the tongue, the lead showing on both sides. I cut out the tongue and\nhung it up to dry, intending to keep it as a trophy; but unfortunately\na vulture swooped down when my back was turned, and carried it off.\n\nFrom the time I knocked the lion over until he first staggered and fell\nnot more than a minute could have elapsed--quite long enough, however,\nto have enabled him to cover the distance and to have seized one or\nother of us. Unquestionably we owed our lives to the fact that we both\nremained absolutely motionless; and I cannot speak too highly of Mahina\nfor the splendid way in which he stood the charge. Had he acted as did\nanother gun-boy I know of, the affair might not have had so happy an\nending. This gun-boy went out with Captain G---- in this very\nneighbourhood, and not long after our adventure. G---- came across a\nlion just as we did, and wounded it. It charged down on them, but\ninstead of remaining absolutely still, the terrified gun-boy fled, with\nthe result that the lion came furiously on, and poor G---- met with a\nterrible death.\n\nWhile Mahina was scouring the neighbourhood in search of some natives\nto carry the skin back to camp, I took a good look round the place and\nfound the half-eaten body of a zebra, which I noticed had been killed\nout in the open and then dragged into the long grass. The tracks told\nme, also, that all the work had been done by the lion, and this set me\nthinking of the lioness. I accordingly swept the plain with my glasses\nin the direction in which she had bounded off, and after some searching\nI discovered her about a mile away, apparently lying down in the midst\nof a herd of hartebeeste, who grazed away without taking any notice of\nher. I felt much inclined to follow her up, but I was afraid that if I\ndid so the vultures that were already hovering around would settle on\nmy lion and spoil the skin, for the destruction of which these ravenous\nbirds are capable, even in the space of only a few minutes, is almost\nbeyond belief. I accordingly returned to the dead beast and sat down\nastride of him. I had read that a frontal shot at a lion was a very\nrisky one, and on carefully examining the head it was easy to see the\nreason; for owing to the sharp backward slope of the forehead it is\nalmost impossible for a bullet fired in this manner to reach the brain.\nAs there were lots of lions about in this district and as I wanted to\nbag some more, I set myself to think out a plan whereby the risk of a\nfrontal shot might be got rid of. About a fortnight afterwards I had an\nopportunity of putting my scheme into practice, happily with most\nexcellent results; this, however, is another story, which will be told\nlater on.\n\nI next commenced to skin my trophy and found it a very tough job to\nperform by myself. He proved to be a very fat beast, so I knew that\nMahina would make a few honest and well-earned rupees out of him, for\nIndians will give almost anything for lion fat, believing that it is an\ninfallible cure for rheumatism and various other diseases. When at\nlength the skinning process was completed, I waited impatiently for the\nreturn of Mahina, who had by this time been gone much longer than I\nexpected. It is rather a nerve shattering thing--I am speaking for\nmyself--to remain absolutely alone for hours on a vast open plain\nbeside the carcase of a dead lion, with vultures incessantly wheeling\nabout above one, and with nothing to be seen or heard for miles around\nexcept wild animals. It was a great relief, therefore, when after a\nlong wait I saw Mahina approaching with half-a-dozen practically naked\nnatives in his train. It turned out that he had lost his way back to\nme, so that it was lucky he found me at all. We lost no time in getting\nback to camp, arriving there just at sundown, when my first business\nwas to rub wood ashes into the skin and then stretch it on a portable\nframe which I had made a few days previously. The camp fire was a big\none that night, and the graphic and highly coloured description which\nMahina gave to the eager circle of listeners of the way in which we\nslew the lion would have made even \"Bahram, that great Hunter,\" anxious\nfor his fame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE STRICKEN CARAVAN\n\n\nNot long after this adventure the permanent way reached the boundary of\nthe Kapiti Plains, where a station had to be built and where\naccordingly we took up our headquarters for a week or two. A few days\nafter we had settled down in our new camp, a great caravan of some four\nthousand men arrived from the interior with luggage and loads of food\nfor a Sikh regiment which was on its way down to the coast, after\nhaving been engaged in suppressing the mutiny of the Sudanese in\nUganda. The majority of these porters were Basoga, but there were also\nfair numbers of Baganda (i.e. people of Uganda) and of the natives of\nUnyoro, and various other tribes. Of course none of these wild men of\nCentral Africa had either seen or heard of a railway in all their\nlives, and they consequently displayed the liveliest curiosity in\nregard to it, crowding round one of the engines which happened to be\nstanding at the station, and hazarding the wildest guesses as to its\norigin and use in a babel of curious native languages. I thought I\nwould provide a little entertainment for them, so I stepped on to the\nfootplate and blew off the steam, at the same time sounding the\nwhistle. The effect was simply magical. The whole crowd first threw\nthemselves flat on the ground howling with fear, and then--with heads\nwell down and arms well spread out--they fled wildly in all directions;\nnor did the stampede cease until I shut off steam and stopped the\nwhistle. Then, their curiosity gradually overpowering them, very\ncautiously they began to return, approaching the locomotive stealthily\nas though it were some living monster of the jungle. Eventually, two of\ntheir chiefs summoned up courage enough to climb on to the engine, and\nafterwards thoroughly enjoyed a short run which I had to make down the\nline in order to bring up some construction material.\n\nJust after this caravan had moved on we were subjected to some\ntorrential rain-storms, which transformed the whole plain into a\nquaking bog and stopped all railway work for the time being. Indeed,\nthe effect of a heavy downpour of rain in this sun-baked district is\nextraordinary. The ground, which is of a black sub-soil, becomes a mass\nof thick mud in no time, and on attempting to do any walking one slides\nand slips about in the slush in a most uncomfortable manner.\nInnocent-looking dongas, where half an hour previously not one drop of\nwater was to be seen, become roaring torrents from bank to bank in an\nincredibly short time; while for many hours or even a few days the\nrivers become absolutely impassable in this land of no bridges. On this\naccount it is the custom of the wise traveller in these parts always to\ncross a river before camping, for otherwise a flood may come down and\ndetain him and his caravan on the wrong side of the stream for perhaps\na week. Of course when the rain ceases, the floods as quickly subside,\nthe rivers and dongas dry up, and the country once more resumes its\nnormal sun-cracked appearance.\n\nOn leaving my tent one morning when work was at a standstill owing to\nthe rain, I noticed a great herd of zebra about a couple of miles away\non the north side of the railway. Now, it had long been my ambition to\ncapture one of these animals alive; so I said to myself, \"Here is my\nchance!\" The men could do nothing owing to the rain, and the ground was\nvery boggy, so I thought that if we could surround the herd judiciously\nand chase the zebra up and down from point to point through the heavy\nground, some of them would soon get exhausted and we should then be\nable to catch them. I selected for the hunt a dozen fleet-footed\nIndians who were employed on the earth works, and who at once entered\nwith great zest into the spirit of the scheme. After having partially\nsurrounded the herd, the half-circle of coolies began to advance with\nwild shouts, whereupon the zebras galloped madly about from side to\nside, and then did just what we wished them to do--made straight for an\nexceptionally boggy part of the ground, where they soon became more or\nless helpless. We singled out a few young ones and succeeded in running\nthem to an absolute standstill, when we threw them down and sat on\ntheir heads until the other men came up with ropes. In this way we\ncaptured no less than six: they were very wild and fractious, giving us\na great deal of trouble in getting them along, but eventually we\nmanaged to bring them in triumph to the camp, where they were firmly\nsecured. The whole expedition lasted little more than a couple of hours.\n\nThree of the captured zebras I kept for myself, while the other three\nwere given to the Surfacing Engineer, whose men had assisted in the\nhunt. Two of my three unfortunately died very shortly after; but the\nthird, a sturdy two-year-old, flourished splendidly. At first he was\nexceedingly vicious, biting and kicking everyone who approached him;\nindeed, he once planted both his hind feet on my chest, but did me no\nserious damage beyond throwing me heavily to the ground. In time,\nhowever, he became very tame and domesticated, allowing himself to be\nled about by a rope and head collar, and would drink from a bucket and\neat from my hand. He used to be left to graze picketed by a long rope\nto a stake in the ground; but one afternoon on returning to camp I\nfound, much to my annoyance, that he had disappeared. On making\nenquiry, I learned from my servants that a herd of wild zebra had\ngalloped close by, and that this had so excited him that he managed to\ntear the picketing peg out of the ground and so rejoin his brethren in\nfreedom.\n\nSome few days after our successful sortie against the zebra, the great\ncaravan of Basoga porters returned from the coast on their way back to\ntheir own country; but alas, with what a terrible difference in their\nappearance! All their gaiety and lightheartedness was gone, and the\npoor fellows were in a pitiable state. A frightful epidemic of\ndysentery had broken out amongst them, doubtless caused by their having\neaten food to which they were entirely unaccustomed, their simple diet\nin their own homes consisting almost entirely of bananas, from which\nthey also make a most refreshing and stimulating drink. The ranks of\nthe caravan were terribly decimated, and dozens of men were left dead\nor dying along the roadside after each march. It was a case of the\nsurvival of the fittest, as of course it was quite impossible for the\nwhole caravan to halt in the wilderness where neither food nor water\nwas to be had. There was only one European with the party, and although\nhe worked like a slave he could do very little among such a number,\nwhile the Basoga themselves seemed quite indifferent to the sufferings\nof their comrades. Thirteen poor wretches fell out to die close to my\ntent; they were in the most hopeless condition and far too weak to be\nable to do anything at all for themselves. As soon as I discovered\nthem, I boiled a bucketful of water, added some tins of condensed milk\nand the greater part of a bottle of brandy to it, and fed them with the\nmixture. Their feeble cries for some of this nourishment were\nheartrending; some could only whisper, \"Bwana, Bwana\" (\"Master,\nMaster\"), and then open their mouths. One or two of them, indeed, could\nhardly do even this, and were so weak as to be unable to swallow the\nspoonful of milk which I put between their lips. In the end six proved\nto be beyond all help, and died that night; but the remaining seven I\nmanaged to nurse into complete recovery in about a fortnight's time. As\nour camp was moved on, they were brought along from place to place on\nthe top of trucks, until finally they were well enough to resume their\njourney to Usoga, very grateful indeed for the care which we had taken\nof them.\n\nThe day after I first found these stricken natives I had arranged to\nride on my pony for some miles in advance of the railway, in order to\nmake arrangements for the building of a temporary bridge over the Stony\nAthi River--a tributary of the Athi, and so-called on account of the\nenormous numbers of stones in its bed and along its banks. I ordered my\ntent to follow me later in the day, and left directions for the care of\nthe sick Basoga, as I knew I should be away all night. My road lay\nalong the route taken by the home-returning caravan, and every hundred\nyards or so I passed the swollen corpse of some unfortunate porter who\nhad fallen out and died by the wayside. Before very long I came up with\nthe rearguard of this straggling army, and here I was witness of as\nunfeeling an act of barbarism as can well be imagined. A poor wretch,\nutterly unable to go a step further, rolled himself up in his scarlet\nblanket and lay down by the roadside to die; whereupon one of his\ncompanions, coveting the highly-coloured and highly-prized article,\nturned back, seized one end of the blanket, and callously rolled the\ndying man out of it as one would unroll a bale of goods. This was too\nmuch for me, so I put spurs to my pony and galloped up to the\nscoundrel, making as if to thrash him with my kiboko, or whip made of\nrhinoceros hide. In a moment he put his hand on his knife and half drew\nit from its sheath, but on seeing me dismount and point my rifle at\nhim, he desisted and tried to run away. I made it clear to him by\nsigns, however, that I would fire if he did not at once go back and\nreplace the blanket round his dying comrade. This he eventually did,\nthough sullenly enough, and I then marched him in front of me to the\nmain camp of the caravan, some little distance further on. Here I\nhanded him over to the officer in charge, who, I am glad to say, had\nhim soundly thrashed for his brutality and theft.\n\nAfter performing this little act of retributive justice, I pushed on\ntowards the Stony Athi. On the way--while still not far from the\ncaravan camp--I spied a Grant's gazelle in the distance, and by the aid\nof my glasses discovered that it was a fine-looking buck with a capital\npair of horns. A few Basoga from the caravan had followed me, doubtless\nin the hope of obtaining meat, of which they are inordinately fond; so,\nhanding them my pony, I wriggled from tuft to tuft and crawled along in\nthe folds of the ground until eventually I got near enough for a safe\nshot, which bowled the antelope over stone-dead. Scarcely had he\ndropped when the Basoga swooped down on him, ripped him open, and\ndevoured huge chunks of the raw and still quivering flesh, lapping up\nthe warm blood in the palms of their hands. In return for the meat\nwhich I gave them, two of them willingly agreed to go on with me and\ncarry the head and haunch of the gazelle. When we had got very nearly\nto the place where I intended to camp for the night, a great wart-hog\nsuddenly jumped up almost at my horse's feet, and as he had very fine\nand exceptionally long tusks, I dismounted at once and bagged him too.\nThe Basoga were delighted at this, and promptly cut off the head; but\nmy own people, who arrived with my tent just at this juncture, and who\nwere all good Mohammedans, were thoroughly disgusted at the sight of\nthis very hideous-looking pig.\n\nI camped for the night on the banks of the Stony Athi, close to where\nthe railway was to cross, and made my notes of what was necessary for\nthe temporary bridge. At the time the river was absolutely dry, but I\nknew that it might at any moment become a roaring torrent if rain\nshould set in; it would therefore be necessary to span it with a\nforty-foot girder in order to prevent constant \"washouts\" during the\nrainy season. The next morning I started early on my return to\nrailhead. On my way I had to pass the camp which the Basoga caravan had\njust left, but the spectacle of about a dozen newly-made graves which\nthe hyenas had already torn open caused me to put spurs to my horse and\nto gallop as fast as possible through the pestilential spot. When I had\nalmost got back to railhead I happened to notice a huge serpent\nstretched out on the grass, warming himself, his skin of old gold and\nbright green sparkling brilliantly in the sunshine. He appeared to take\nlittle notice of me as I cautiously approached, and was probably drowsy\nand sated with a heavy meal. I shot him through the head as he lay, and\nthe muscular contortions after death throughout his long body gave me a\nvery vivid idea of the tremendous squeezing power possessed by these\nreptiles. Skinning him was an easy process, but unfortunately his\nbeautiful colouring soon disappeared, the old gold turning to white and\nthe bright green to lustreless black.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA DAY ON THE ATHI RIVER\n\n\nIn spite of all our difficulties, rapid progress continued to be made\nwith the line. Each day railhead crept a mile or so further across the\nPlains, and on April 24 we reached the Stony Athi River, where our\ngreat camp was pitched for a few days while the temporary bridge was\nbeing thrown across the dry bed of the stream. Still another temporary\nbridge had to be arranged for the Athi itself, which was some eight\nmiles further on, so I had to make one or two expeditions to this river\nin order to select a suitable place for the crossing and to make\nvarious other arrangements. On one of these occasions I was busy\nattending to the pitching of my tent after arriving at the Athi late in\nthe evening, when on looking round I was very much surprised to see two\nEuropean ladies sitting under the shade of some trees on the river\nbank. As I knew that this was anything but a safe place in which to\nrest, owing to the number of lions about, I went up to them to see if I\ncould be of any assistance, and found that they were American\nmissionaries journeying to their stations further inland. They were\nwaiting for their camp equipment to arrive, but their porters had been\nconsiderably delayed by some very heavy rain, which of course made the\nroads bad and the tents about double their usual weight. The men of the\nparty were expected every moment with the porters, but there was as yet\nno sign of the little caravan, and as a matter of fact it did not\narrive until long after nightfall. In these circumstances it was\nperhaps a great blessing that I happened to be there; and as the ladies\nwere both very tired and hungry, I was glad to be able to place my tent\nat their disposal and to offer them as good a dinner as it was possible\nto provide in the wilds. It is indeed wonderful what dangers and\nhardships these delicately nurtured ladies will face cheerfully in\norder to carry out their self-appointed mission.\n\nWhen they had left next morning to resume their journey, I started out\nand made a search up and down the river for the proper position for my\ntemporary bridge. After a thorough examination of all the possible\nsituations, I chose the most suitable and pitched my tent close to it\nfor a night or two while I made the necessary calculations for carrying\nout the work. The crossing on which I had decided had to be approached\nby a somewhat sharp curve in the line, and in laying this out with the\ntheodolite I experienced considerable difficulty, as for some reason or\nother I could not make the last peg on the curve come anywhere near the\ntangent point where the curve should link up with the straight. I\nrepeated the whole operation time after time, but always with the same\nresult. Eventually I came to the conclusion that there must be some\nmistake in the table of angles from which I had been working, so I\nstarted to work them out for myself and soon discovered a serious\nmisprint. This being rectified in my calculations, I proceeded to lay\nout the curve again, when at last everything came out accurately and to\nmy satisfaction.\n\nAfter I had pegged out this temporary diversion of the line, I thought\nI richly deserved a few hours' play, and accordingly determined to try\nmy luck after lions up-stream towards the source of the Athi. The\nriver--which runs almost due north here, before taking a turn eastward\nto the Indian Ocean--forms part of the western boundary of the Athi\nPlains, and is fringed all along its course by a belt of thorny\nhardwood trees. In some places this fringe is quite narrow, while in\nothers it is about a quarter of a mile wide, with grassy glades here\nand there among the trees. Every now and again, too, the stream itself\nwidens out into a broad stretch of water, nearly always covered over\nwith tall reeds and elephant grass, while along the banks are frequent\npatches of stunted bushes, which struck me as very likely places for\nthe king of beasts to sleep in after having drunk at the river. I had\nnoticed that after having eaten and drunk well, a lion would throw\nhimself down quite without caution in the first shady spot he came to;\nof course nothing except man ever disturbs him, and even of man the\nlions in this part of the country had as yet no fear, for they had\nrarely if ever been hunted previous to my time.\n\nAs I felt rather tired after my morning's work, I decided to use my\npony on this expedition, although as a rule I went on foot. Mahina and\nhalf-a-dozen natives to beat the belt of trees were to accompany me,\nand after a hasty lunch off we started up the left bank of the river. I\nwalked for some distance at first, partly because the ground was very\nstony and partly because I thought a lion might suddenly bound out of\nsome likely patches in front of the beaters; but after having gone\nabout six miles in this way without adventure of any kind, I decided to\nmount again. At this time the beaters were in line about a hundred\nyards behind me, shouting and halloing with all their might as they\nadvanced through the scrub and undergrowth, while I rode well to the\nflank so as to be ready for any emergency. Just as the men got up to a\nrather thicker piece of jungle than usual, I fancied I saw a movement\namong the bushes and pulled up suddenly to watch the spot, but did not\ndismount. The next moment out bounded a lioness, who raced straight\nacross the open strip into the next patch of jungle, quickly followed\nby another. Throwing myself off my pony, I seized my rifle to get a\nshot at the second lioness as she galloped past, and was just about to\npull the trigger, when to my utter amazement out sprang a huge\nblack-maned lion, making all haste after his mates. Before he could\nreach the further thicket, however, I fired, and had the satisfaction\nof hearing the deep growl that tells of a serious hit.\n\nThe beaters and I now advanced with great care, taking advantage of\nevery bit of cover and keeping a sharp look-out for the wounded animal\nas we crept from tree to tree. Fully a quarter of an hour must have\nelapsed in this slow yet exciting search, before one of the men, some\nfifty or sixty yards to my left, and a little ahead of the line, called\nout that he could see the lion awaiting our approach, with his head\njust visible in a large bed of rushes only a short distance in front of\nwhere I then was. Almost at the same moment I found blood marks left by\nthe wounded animal, leading apparently to a kind of gap in the bank of\nthe river, which had evidently been worn down by a rhino going to and\nfro to drink. I accordingly made for this with the greatest caution,\nordering all the men, except Mahina, to remain behind; and as\nnoiselessly as possible I slipped from cover to cover in my endeavour\nto obtain a peep over the bank. I saw that it was no use to attempt to\nclimb a tree, as the overspreading foliage would have prevented me from\nobtaining any view ahead; so I continued my slow advance with a\nfast-beating heart, not knowing where the huge brute was and expecting\nevery moment that he would charge out at me over the bank from his\nreedy refuge. Emboldened to a certain extent, however, by the fact that\nup till then I had heard no movement on the part of my enemy, I crept\nsteadily forward and at last, from the shelter of a friendly tree\nbehind the bole of which I hid myself, I was able to look over the\nbank. And there, not twenty yards from me, crouched the lion--luckily\nwatching, not me, but the native who had first seen him and who had\ndirected me to where he was. I raised my rifle very cautiously, without\nmaking the slightest sound, and steadying the barrel against the trunk\nof the tree and standing on tip-toe in order to get a better view, I\nfired plump at the side of his head. It was as if he had suddenly been\nhit with a sledgehammer, for he fell over instantly and lay like a log.\n\nOn my calling out that the lion was done for, the beaters came running\nup shouting with joy; and although I warned them to be careful, as the\ntwo lionesses were probably still close at hand, they did not seem to\ncare in the slightest and in a twinkling had the dead lion lifted from\nthe reeds on to the dry bank. Before I allowed anything further to be\ndone, however, I had the patch of rushes thoroughly beaten out: but as\nno traces of the lionesses could be found, we commenced to skin my fine\ntrophy. When this was about half done, I decided to let Mahina finish\nthe operation, while I went on ahead to try my luck either with more\nlions or with any other game that might come my way. I followed up the\nriver almost to its source, but no more lions crossed my path. Once\nindeed I felt convinced that I saw one, and gave chase to it with all\nmy might as it rushed through the long grass: but a nearer view showed\nme nothing more than a huge wart-hog. As I wanted the tusks, which I\nnoticed were very fine ones, I fired but only badly hipped him: so I\nran up as fast as I could and at ten yards fired again. This time I\nmissed him entirely, and was puzzled to account for my failure until I\nlooked at my back sight and found that by some accident it had got\nraised and that I had the 200-yards sight up. On rectifying this,\nanother shot quickly put the wounded animal out of pain.\n\nStill my day's sport was not yet over. While rambling back through the\ntrees I caught sight of a graceful-looking antelope in the distance,\nand on cautiously approaching closer saw that it was an impala. My\nstalk was crowned with success, the beautiful animal being bagged\nwithout much trouble; and on reaching my prize I was delighted to find\nthat its horns were much above the average. On another occasion I was\nfortunate enough to get a successful snapshot of an impala just after\nit had been shot by a friend, and the photograph gives a very good idea\nof what mine was like.\n\nAs it was now growing late, I made all haste back to where I had left\nMahina skinning the lion, but to my astonishment he was nowhere to be\nseen. I fired several shots and shouted myself hoarse, all without\nresponse; and the only conclusion I could come to was that he had\nreturned to the camp at the temporary bridge. I accordingly pushed on,\nreaching home long after dark; and there I found Mahina safe and sound,\nwith the lion's skin already pegged out to dry, so that I could not\nfind it in my heart to give him the severe scolding he deserved for\nhaving returned without me. Next morning I packed up my trophies and\nreturned to my work at railhead. On my way back I happened to meet one\nof the other engineers, who called out, \"Hallo! I hear you have got a\nfine line.\"\n\nMy thoughts being full of my adventures of the day before, I answered:\n\"Yes, I did; but how on earth did you hear of it?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, \"Reynolds told me.\"\n\n\"Good heavens,\" I replied, \"why, he left before I shot it.\"\n\n\"Shot?\" he exclaimed, \"whatever do you mean?\"\n\n\"Didn't you say,\" I asked, \"that you heard I had got a fine lion?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" was his reply; \"a fine line for the temporary bridge over the\nriver.\"\n\nWe both laughed heartily at the misunderstanding, and when he saw my\ntrophy, which was being carried by my man just behind me, he agreed\nthat it was quite fine enough to monopolise my thoughts and prevent me\nfrom thinking of anything else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE MASAI AND OTHER TRIBES\n\n\nA few Masai may still be seen on the Athi Plains, but as a rule they\nkeep away from the railway, the majority of the tribe being now settled\non the Laikipia Plateau. Formerly they were by far the most powerful\nnative race in East Africa, and when on the war-path were the terror of\nthe whole country from the furthest limits of Uganda to Mombasa itself.\nTheir numbers have latterly become greatly reduced through famine and\nsmall-pox, but the remnant of the tribe, more especially the men, are\nstill a fine, lithe, clean-limbed people. While I was stationed in the\nPlains I managed to have an interview with the chief, Lenana, at one of\nhis \"royal residences,\" a kraal near Nairobi. He was affability itself,\npresenting me with a spear and shield as a memento of the occasion; but\nhe had the reputation of being a most wily old potentate, and I found\nthis quite correct, as whenever he was asked an awkward question, he\nwould nudge his Prime Minister and command him to answer for him. I\nmanaged to induce him and his wives and children to sit for their\nphotograph, and they made a very fine group indeed; but unfortunately\nthe negative turned out very badly. I also got Lenana's nephew and a\nwarrior to engage in combat with the spear and shield, and both made\nfine play with their long keen blades, which more than once penetrated\nthe opponent's shield.\n\nThe Masai have a wonderfully well-organised military system. The\nwarriors (elmorani) of the tribe must attend strictly to their duties,\nand are not allowed to marry or to smoke or to drink until after their\nterm of active service is completed. Besides the spear and shield they\ngenerally carry a sword or knobkerrie, suspended from a raw-hide\nwaist-belt; and they certainly look very ferocious in their\nweird-looking headdress when on the warpath. Once or twice I met\ndetachments out on these expeditions, but they were always quite\nfriendly to me, even though I was practically alone. Before the advent\nof British rule, however, sudden raids were constantly being made by\nthem on the weaker tribes in the country; and when a kraal was captured\nall the male defenders-were instantly killed with the spear, while the\nwomen were put to death during the night with clubs. The Masai, indeed,\nnever made slaves or took prisoners, and it was their proud boast that\nwhere a party of elmorani had passed, nothing of any kind was left\nalive. The object of these raids was, of course, to capture live stock,\nfor the Masai are not an agricultural people and their wealth consists\nentirely in their herds of cattle, sheep and goats. Curiously enough\nthey do not hunt game, although the country abounds with it, but live\nprincipally on beef and milk; and it is also a common custom for them\nto drink daily a pint or so of blood taken from a live bullock. As they\nthus live entirely on cattle, and as cattle cannot thrive without good\npasture, it is not unnatural to find that they have a great reverence\nfor grass. They also worship a Supreme Being whom they call N'gai, but\nthis term is also applied to anything which is beyond their\nunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps the most curious of the customs of the Masai is the extraction\nof the two front teeth from the lower jaw. It is said that this habit\noriginated at a time when lockjaw was very prevalent among the tribe,\nand it was found that if these teeth were pulled out food could still\nbe taken. This explanation seems scarcely satisfactory or sufficient,\nand I give it only for what it is worth: but whatever the reason for\nthe custom, the absence of these two teeth constitutes a most\ndistinctive identifying mark. I remember once being out with a Masai\none day when we came across the bleached skull of a long defunct member\nof his tribe, of course easily recognisable as such by the absence of\nthe proper teeth. The Masai at once plucked a handful of grass, spat\nupon it, and then placed it very carefully within the skull; this was\ndone, he said, to avert evil from himself. The same man asked me among\nmany other questions if my country was nearer to God than his. I am\nafraid I was unable conscientiously to answer him in the affirmative.\nFormerly the Masai used to spit in the face as a mark of great\nfriendship, but nowadays--like most other native races--they have\nadopted our English fashion of shaking hands.\n\nAnother very common custom amongst them is that of distorting the lobe\nof the ear by stretching it until it hangs down quite five or six\ninches. It is then pierced and decorated in various ways--by sticking\nthrough it a piece of wood two or three inches in diameter, or a little\nround tin canister, and by hanging to it pieces of chain, rings, beads,\nor bunches of brass-headed nails, according to fancy. Nearly all the\nmen wear little bells on their ankles to give notice of their approach,\nwhile the women are very fond of covering themselves with large\nquantities of iron or copper wire. Their limbs, indeed, are often\nalmost completely encased with these rings, which I should think must\nbe very heavy and uncomfortable: but no Masai woman considers herself a\nlady of fashion without them, and the more she possesses the higher\ndoes she stand in the social scale.\n\nAs a rule, the Masai do not bury their dead, as they consider this\ncustom to be prejudicial to the soil; the bodies are simply carried\nsome little distance from the village and left to be devoured by birds\nand wild beasts. The honour of burial is reserved only for a great\nchief, over whose remains a large mound is also raised. I came across\none of these mounds one day near Tsavo and opened it very carefully,\nbut found nothing: possibly I did not pursue my search deep enough into\nthe earth. In general, the Masai are an upright and honourable savage\nrace, and it is a great pity that they are gradually dying out.\n\nMore or less serfs of the Masai are the Wa N'derobbo, who, unlike their\nover-lords, are a race of hunters. They are seldom to be met with,\nhowever, as they hide away in caves and thickets, and keep constantly\nmoving from place to place following the game. Not long ago I saw a few\nof them in the neighbourhood of the Eldama Ravine: but these were more\nor less civilised, and the girls, who were quite graceful, had\nabandoned the native undress costume for flowing white robes.\n\nIn the district from Nairobi to the Kedong River, and in the Kenya\nProvince, dwell the Wa Kikuyu, who are similar to the Masai in build,\nbut not nearly so good-looking. Like the latter, they use the spear and\nshield, though of a different shape; their principal weapon, however,\nis the bow and poisoned arrow. They also frequently carry a rudely made\ntwo-edged short sword in a sheath, which is slung round the waist by a\nbelt of raw hide. Their front teeth are filed to a sharp point in the\nsame manner as those of nearly all the other native tribes of East\nAfrica, with the exception of the Masai. They live in little villages\ncomposed of beehive huts and always situated in the very thickest\npatches of forest that they can find, and their cattle kraals are\nespecially strongly built and carefully hidden. On one occasion I\nmanaged after a great deal of difficulty and crawling on all-fours to\nmake my way into one of these kraals, and was much amazed to notice\nwhat labour and ingenuity had been expended on its construction. Unlike\nthe Masai, the Wa Kikuyu have a fairly good idea of agriculture, and\ngrow crops of m'tama (a kind of native grain from which flour is made),\nsugar-cane, sweet potatoes, and tobacco.\n\nThe Wa Kikuyu have the reputation of being a very cowardly and\ntreacherous people, and they have undoubtedly committed some very cruel\ndeeds. A friend of mine, Captain Haslem, with whom I lived for a few\nmonths at Tsavo, was barbarously murdered by some members of this\ntribe. He left me to go up to the Kikuyu country in charge of the\ntransport, and as he was keenly interested in finding out all about the\ntropical diseases from which the animals suffered, he made it his\ncustom to dissect the bodies of those that died. The superstitious Wa\nKikuyu were fully convinced that by this he bewitched their cattle,\nwhich at the time were dying in scores from rinderpest. So--instigated\nno doubt by the all-powerful witch-doctor--they treacherously killed\nhim. For my part, however, I found them not nearly so black as they had\nbeen painted to me. I had about four hundred of them working at one\nthing or another at Nairobi and never had any trouble with them. On the\ncontrary I found them well-behaved and intelligent and most anxious to\nlearn.\n\nAs is the case with all other African races, the women of the Wa Kikuyu\ndo the manual labour of the village and carry the heavy loads for their\nlords and masters, the bundles being held in position on their back by\na strap passing round the forehead.\n\nNotwithstanding this some of them are quite pleasant looking, and once\nthey have overcome their fear of the European, do not object to being\nphotographed.\n\nOf the other tribes to be met with in this part of the world, the\nKavirondo are the most interesting. They are an industrious, simple\npeople, devoted to agriculture and hospitable in the extreme--a little\naddicted to thieving, perhaps, but then that is scarcely considered a\nsin in the heart of Africa. They are clothed (to use Mark Twain's\nexpression) in little but a smile, a bead or two here and there being\nconsidered ample raiment; nevertheless they are modest in their ways\nand are on the whole about the best of the East African tribes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nHOW ROSHAN KHAN SAVED MY LIFE\n\n\nOn May 12 railhead reached the Athi River, where, as there was a great\ndeal of miscellaneous work to be done, our headquarters remained\nestablished for some little time. One day not long after we had settled\ndown in our new camp, I was joined quite unexpectedly by my friend Dr.\nBrock, who had shared the exciting adventure with me at Tsavo the night\nwe were attacked in the goods-wagon by one of the man-eaters. Now Brock\nhad so far not been fortunate enough to bag a lion, and was\nconsequently most anxious to do so. Shortly after his arrival,\naccordingly, he suggested that we should go for a shooting expedition\non the morrow, and that I should trot out for his benefit one of the\nlocal lions. Of course I said I should be delighted--I was always ready\nfor a hunt when it was possible for me to get away, and as just at the\ntime we were \"held up\" by the Athi River, I could manage a day off\nquite easily. So we made the usual preparations for a day's absence\nfrom camp--filled our water-bottles with tea, put a loaf of bread and a\ntin of sardines in our haversacks, looked carefully to our rifles and\nammunition; and warned the \"boys\" who were to accompany us as beaters\nto be ready before dawn. I decided to make a very early start, as I\nknew that the most likely place for lions lay some distance away, and I\nwanted to get there if possible by daybreak. We should thus have a\nbetter chance of catching one of the lords of the plain as he returned\nfrom his nightly depredations to the kindly shelter of the tall grass\nand rushes which fringed the banks of the river. We therefore retired\nto rest early, and just as I was dozing off to sleep, one of my Indian\nservants, Roshan Khan, put his head through the slit at my tent door\nand asked leave to accompany the \"Sahibs\" in the morning so that he\nmight see what shikar (hunting) was like. This request I sleepily\ngranted, thinking that it could make little difference whether he came\nwith us or stayed behind in camp. As things turned out, however, it\nmade all the difference in the world, for if he had not accompanied us,\nmy shikar would in all probability have ended disastrously next day. He\nwas a very dusky-coloured young Pathan about twenty years of age, lithe\nand active, and honest and pleasant-looking, as Pathans go. He had been\nmy \"boy\" for some time and was much attached to me, besides having a\ntouching faith in my prowess in shikar: probably, indeed, this was the\nreason why he stuck so close to me throughout the hunt.\n\nWe breakfasted by candle light and managed to get several miles on our\nway towards the source of the Athi before dawn. As soon as it was\nthoroughly daylight, we extended in line, Dr. Brock, as the guest,\nbeing placed in the most likely position for a shot, while Roshan Khan\nfollowed close behind me with the day's provisions. In this order we\ntrudged steadily forward for a couple of miles without coming across\nanything, though we advanced through many patches of rushes and long\ngrass likely to conceal our expected quarry. It was most interesting\nand exciting work all the same, as we never knew but that a lion might\nthe next moment jump up at our very feet. We had just beaten through a\nmost hopeful-looking covert without success and had come out on to a\nbeautiful open grassy glade which stretched away for some distance\nahead of us, when I noticed a big herd of wildebeeste browsing quietly\nsome distance to our right. I knew that Brock also wanted a\nwildebeeste, so I whistled softly to him, and pointed out the\nweird-looking, bison-like antelopes. He came across at once and started\noff towards the herd, while I sat down to watch the proceedings. He\nmade a beautiful stalk, which was rendered really very difficult by the\nopen nature of the country, but still the wildebeeste quickly noticed\nhis approach and kept steadily moving on, until at last they\ndisappeared over one of the gentle rises which are such a feature of\nthe Athi Plains.\n\nI still sat and waited, expecting every moment to hear the sound of\nBrock's rifle. Some time elapsed without a shot, however, and I was\njust about to follow him up and find out how things were going, when\nRoshan Khan suddenly exclaimed excitedly:--\"Dekko, Sahib, shenzi ata\nhain!\" (\"Look, Sahib, the savages are coming!\"). I was not in the least\nalarmed at this somewhat startling announcement, as the Indians called\nall the natives of the interior of Africa shenzi, or savages; and on\nlooking round I saw five tall, slim Masai approaching in Indian file,\neach carrying a six-foot spear in his right hand. On coming nearer, the\nleader of the party eagerly asked in Swahili, \"What does the Bwana\nMakubwa (\"Great Master\") desire?\"\n\n\"Simba\" (\"Lions\"), said I.\n\n\"Come,\" he replied, \"I will show you many.\"\n\nThis filled me with interest at once. \"How far away are they?\" I asked.\n\n\"M'bali kidogo\" (\"A little distance\"), came the stereotyped reply.\n\nI immediately had a good look round for Brock, but could see no sign of\nhim, so, in case the \"many\" lions should get away in the meantime, I\ntold the Masai to lead the way, and off we started.\n\nAs usual, the m'bali kidogo proved a good distance--over two miles in\nthis case. Indeed, I began to get impatient at the long tramp, and\ncalled out to the Masai to know where his lions were; but he vouchsafed\nme no answer and continued to walk steadily on, casting keen glances\nahead. After a little I again asked, \"Where are the lions?\" This time\nhe extended his spear in a most dramatic manner, and pointing to a\nclump of trees just ahead, exclaimed: \"Look, Master; there are the\nlions.\" I looked, and at once caught sight of a lioness trotting off\nbehind the bushes. I also saw some suspicious-looking thing at the foot\nof one of the big trees, but came to the conclusion that it was only a\ngrowth of some kind projecting from the trunk. I was soon to be\nundeceived, however, for as I started to run towards the trees in order\nto cut off the fast disappearing lioness from a stretch of rushes for\nwhich she was making, a low and sinister growl made me look closer at\nthe object which had first aroused my suspicions. To my surprise and\ndelight I saw that it was the head of a huge black-maned lion peering\nout from behind the trunk of the tree, which completely hid his body. I\npulled up short and stared at him. Although he was not seventy yards\naway from me, yet owing to the nature of the background it was very\ndifficult to make him out, especially as he kept his head perfectly\nstill, gazing steadily at me. It was only when the great mouth opened\nin an angry snarl that I could see plainly what he really was. For a\nfew seconds we stood thus and looked at each other; then he growled\nagain and made off after the lioness. As I could not get a fair shot at\nhim from where I stood, I ran with all my might for a point of vantage\nfrom which I might have a better chance of bagging him as he passed.\n\nNow by this time I had almost got beyond the surprise stage where lions\nwere concerned; yet I must admit that I was thoroughly startled and\nbrought to a full stop in the middle of my race by seeing no less than\nfour more lionesses jump up from the covert which the lion had just\nleft. In the twinkling of an eye three of them had disappeared after\ntheir lord in long, low bounds, but the fourth stood broadside on,\nlooking, not at me, but at my followers, who by this time were grouped\ntogether and talking and gesticulating excitedly. This gave me a\nsplendid chance for a shoulder shot at about fifty yards' distance, so\nI knelt down at once and fired after taking careful aim. The lioness\ndisappeared from sight instantly, and on looking over the top of the\ngrass I saw that my shot had told, as she was on her back, clawing the\nair and growling viciously. As she looked to me to be done for, I\nshouted to some of the men to remain behind and watch her, while I set\noff once more at a run to try to catch up the lion. I feared that the\ncheck with the lioness might have lost him to me altogether, but to my\nrelief I soon caught sight of him again. He had not made off very\nquickly, and had probably stopped several times to see what I was up\nto; indeed the men, who could see him all the time, afterwards told me\nthat when he heard the growl of rage from the lioness after she was\nshot, he made quite a long halt, apparently deliberating whether he\nshould return to her rescue. Evidently, however, he had decided that\ndiscretion was the better part of valour. Fortunately he was travelling\nleisurely, and I was delighted to find that I was gaining on him fast;\nbut I had still to run about two hundred yards at my best pace, which,\nat an altitude of more than 5,000 feet above sea-level, leaves one very\nbreathless at the end of it.\n\nWhen the lion perceived me running towards him, he took up his station\nunder a tree, where he was half hidden by some low bushes, above which\nonly his head showed. Here he stood, watching my every movement and\ngiving vent to his anger at my presence in low, threatening growls. I\ndid not at all like the look of him, and if there had been another tree\nclose by, I should certainly have scrambled up it into safety before\nattempting to fire. As a matter of fact, however, there was no shelter\nof any kind at hand; so, as I meant to have a try for him at all costs,\nI sat down where I was, about sixty yards from him, and covered his\ngreat head with my rifle. I was so breathless after my run, and my arms\nwere so shaky, that it was all I could do to keep the sight on the\nfierce-looking target and I thought to myself, as the rifle barrel\nwobbled about, \"If I don't knock him over with the first shot, he will\nbe out of these bushes and down on me like greased lightning--and then\nI know what to expect.\" It was a most exciting moment, but in spite of\nthe risk I would not have missed it for the world; so, taking as steady\nan aim as was possible in the circumstances, I pulled the trigger.\nInstantly the shaggy head disappeared from view, and such a succession\nof angry roars and growls came up out of the bushes that I was fairly\nstartled, and felt keenly anxious to finish him off before he could\ncharge out and cover the short distance which separated us. I therefore\nfired half a dozen shots into the bushes at the spot where I imagined\nhe lay, and soon the growling and commotion ceased, and all was still.\nI was confident the brute was dead, so I called up one of the men to\nstay and watch the place, while I again rushed off at full\nspeed--jumping over such rocks and bushes as came in my way--to have a\nshot at a lioness that was still in sight.\n\nBy this time my followers numbered about thirty men, as when one is\nhunting in these plains natives seem to spring from nowhere in the most\nmysterious manner, and attach themselves to one in the hope of\nobtaining same portion of the kill. By signal I ordered them to advance\nin line on the thicket in which the lioness had just taken refuge,\nwhile I took up my position on one side, so as to obtain a good shot\nwhen she broke covert. The line of natives shouting their native cries\nand striking their spears together soon disturbed her, and out she\nsprang into the open, making for a clump of rushes close to the river.\nUnfortunately she broke out at the most unfavourable spot from my point\nof view, as some of the natives masked my fire, and I had consequently\nto wait until she got almost to the edge of the rushes. Whether or not\nI hit her then I cannot say; at any rate, she made good her escape into\nthe reeds, where I decided to leave her until Brock should arrive.\n\nI now retraced my steps towards the spot where I had shot the lion,\nexpecting, of course, to find the man I had told to watch him still on\nguard. To my intense vexation, however, I found that my sentry had\ndeserted his post and had joined the other men of the party, having\nbecome frightened when left by himself. The result of his disobedience\nwas that now I could not tell where lay the dead lion--or, rather, the\nlion which I believed to be dead; but I had no intention of losing so\nfine a trophy, so I began a systematic search, dividing the jungle into\nstrips, and thus going over the whole place thoroughly. The task of\nfinding him, however, was not so easy as might be thought; the chase\nafter the lioness had taken us some distance from where I had shot him,\nand as there were numbers of trees about similar to that under which he\nfell, it was really a very difficult matter to hit upon the right\nplace. At last one of the men sang out joyfully that he had found the\nlion at the same time running away from the spot as hard as ever he\ncould. A number of those nearest to him, both Indians and natives, had\nmore courage or curiosity, and went up to have a look at the beast. I\nshouted to them as I hurried along to be careful and not to go too\nnear, in case by any chance he might not be dead; but they paid little\nheed to the warning, and by the time I got up, some half-dozen of them\nwere gathered in a group at the lion's tail, gesticulating wildly and\nchattering each in his own language, and all very pleased and excited.\nOn getting near I asked if the lion was dead, and was told that he was\nnearly so, but that he still breathed. He was lying at full length on\nhis side, and when I saw him at close quarters I was more delighted\nthan I can tell, for he was indeed a very fine specimen. For a moment\nor two I stood with the group of natives, admiring him. He still\nbreathed regularly, as his flanks heaved with each respiration; but as\nhe lay absolutely still with all the men jabbering within a yard of\nhim, I assumed that he was on the point of death and unable to rise.\nPossessed with this belief, I very foolishly allowed my curiosity to\nrun away with my caution, and stepped round to have a look at his head.\nThe moment I came into his view, however, he suddenly became possessed\nof a diabolical ferocity. With a great roar he sprang to his feet, as\nif he were quite unhurt; his eyes blazed with fury, and his lips were\ndrawn well back, exposing his tusks and teeth in a way I hope never to\nwitness again. When this perilous situation so unexpectedly developed\nitself, I was not more than three paces away from him.\n\nThe instant the lion rose, all the men fled as if the Evil One himself\nwere after them, and made for the nearest trees--with one exception,\nfor as I took a step backwards, keeping my eye on the infuriated\nanimal, I almost trod on Roshan Khan, who had still remained close\nbehind me. Fortunately for me, I had approached the lion's head with my\nrifle ready, and as I stepped back I fired. The impact of the .303\nbullet threw him back on his haunches just as he was in the act of\nspringing, but in an instant he was up again and coming for me so\nquickly that I had not even time to raise my rifle to my shoulder, but\nfired point blank at him from my hip, delaying him for a second or so\nas before. He was up again like lightning, and again at the muzzle of\nmy rifle; and this time I thought that nothing on earth could save me,\nas I was almost within his clutches. Help came from an unexpected and\nunconscious quarter, for just at this critical moment Roshan Khan\nseemed all at once to realise the danger of the situation, and suddenly\nfled for his life, screaming and shrieking with all his might. Beyond\nall question this movement saved me, for the sight of something darting\naway from him diverted the lion's attention from me, and following his\nnatural instinct, he gave chase instead to the yelling fugitive.\n\nRoshan Khan having thus unwittingly rescued me from my perilous\nposition, it now became my turn to do all I could to save him, if this\nwere possible. In far less time than it takes to tell the story, I had\nswung round after the pursuing lion, levelled my rifle and fired; but\nwhether because of the speed at which he was going, or because of my\nover-anxiety to save my \"boy\", I missed him completely, and saw the\nbullet raise the dust at the heels of a flying Masai. Like lightning I\nloaded again from the magazine, but now the lion was within a spring of\nhis prey, and it seemed hopeless to expect to save poor Roshan Khan\nfrom his clutches. Just at this moment, however, the terrified youth\ncaught sight of the brute over his left shoulder, and providentially\nmade a quick swerve to the right. As the lion turned to follow him, he\ncame broadside on to me, and just as he had Roshan Khan within striking\ndistance and was about to seize him, he dropped in the middle of what\nwould otherwise assuredly have been the fatal spring--bowled over with\na broken shoulder. This gave me time to run up and give him a final\nshot, and with a deep roar he fell back full length on the grass,\nstone-dead.\n\nI then looked round to see if Roshan Khan was all right, as I was not\nsure whether the lion had succeeded in mauling him or not. The sight\nthat met my eyes turned tragedy into comedy in an instant, and made me\nroar with laughter; indeed, it was so utterly absurd that I threw\nmyself down on the grass and rolled over and over, convulsed with\nuncontrollable mirth. For there was Roshan Khan, half-way up a thorn\ntree, earnestly bent on getting to the very topmost branch as quickly\nas ever he could climb; not a moment, indeed, was he able to spare to\ncast a glance at what was happening beneath. His puggaree had been torn\noff by one thorn, and waved gracefully in the breeze; a fancy waistcoat\nadorned another spiky branch, and his long white cotton gown was torn\nto ribbons in his mad endeavour to put as great a distance as possible\nbetween himself and the dead lion. As soon as I could stop laughing, I\ncalled out to him to come down, but quite in vain. There was no\nstopping him, indeed, until he had reached the very top of the tree;\nand even then he could scarcely be induced to come down again. Poor\nfellow, he had been thoroughly terrified, and little wonder.\n\nMy followers now began to emerge from the shelter of the various trees\nand bushes where they had concealed themselves after their wild flight\nfrom the resuscitated lion, and crowded round his dead body in the\nhighest spirits. The Masai, especially, seemed delighted at the way in\nwhich he had been defeated, and to my surprise and amusement proved\nthemselves excellent mimics, some three or four of them beginning at\nonce to act the whole adventure. One played the part of the lion and\njumped growling at a comrade, who immediately ran backwards just as I\nhad done, shouting \"Ta, Ta, Ta\" and cracking his fingers to represent\nthe rifle-shots. Finally the whole audience roared with delight when\nanother bolted as fast as he could to Roshan Khan's tree with the\npseudo lion roaring after him. At the end of these proceedings up came\nBrock, who had been attracted to the place by the sound of the firing.\nHe was much astonished to see my fine dead lion lying stretched out,\nand his first remark was, \"You are a lucky beggar!\" Afterwards, when he\nheard the full story of the adventure, he rightly considered me even\nmore lucky than he had first thought.\n\nOur next business was to go back to the lioness which I had first shot\nand left for dead. Like her mate, however, she was still very much\nalive when we reached her, so I stalked carefully up to a neighbouring\ntree, from whose shelter I gave her the finishing shot. We then left\nMahina and the other men to skin the two beasts, and went on to the\nrushes where the second lioness had taken cover. Here all our efforts\nto turn her out failed, so we reluctantly abandoned the chase and were\nfated to see no more lions that day.\n\nOur only other adventure was with a stolid old rhino, who gave me\nrather a fright and induced Brock to indulge in some lively exercise.\nSeparated by about a hundred yards or so, we were walking over the\nundulating ground a short distance from the river, when, on gaining the\ntop of a gentle rise, I suddenly came upon the ungainly animal as it\nlay wallowing in a hollow. It jumped to its feet instantly and came for\nwhere I stood, and as I had no wish to shoot it, I made a dash for\ncover round the knoll. On reaching the top of the rise, the rhino\nwinded my companion and at once changed its direction and made for him.\nBrock lost no time in putting on his best pace in an endeavour to reach\nthe shelter of a tree which stood some distance off, while I sat down\nand watched the exciting race. I thought it would be a pretty close\nthing, but felt confident that Brock, who was very active, would manage\nto pull it off. When he got about half-way to the tree, however, he\nturned to see how far his pursuer was behind, and in doing so put his\nfoot in a hole in the ground, and to my horror fell head over heels,\nhis rifle flying from his grasp. I expected the great brute to be on\nhim in a moment, but to my intense relief the old rhino stopped dead\nwhen he saw the catastrophe which had taken place, and then, failing (I\nsuppose) to understand it, suddenly made off in the opposite direction\nas hard as he could go. In the meantime Brock had got to his feet\nagain, and raced for dear life to the tree without ever looking round.\nIt was a most comical sight, and I sat on the rise and for the second\ntime that day laughed till my sides ached.\n\nAfter this we returned to the scene of my morning's adventure, where we\nfound that the invaluable Mahina had finished skinning the two lions.\nWe accordingly made our way back to camp with our trophies, all of us,\nwith perhaps the exception of Roshan Khan, well satisfied with the\nday's outing. Whenever afterwards I wanted to chaff this \"boy\", I had\nonly to ask whether he would like to come and see some more shikar. He\nwould then look very solemn, shake his head emphatically and assure me\n\"Kabhi nahin, Sahib\" (\"Never again, Sir\").\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nA SUCCESSFUL LION HUNT\n\n\nWhen the Athi river had been bridged, the section of the line to\nNairobi was pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and from dawn to\ndark we all exerted ourselves to the very utmost. One day (May 28) the\nweather was exceptionally hot, and I had been out in the broiling sun\never since daylight superintending the construction of banks and\ncuttings and the erection of temporary bridges. On returning to my hut,\ntherefore, at about three o'clock in the afternoon, I threw myself into\na long deck chair, too tired for anything beyond a long cool drink.\nHere I rested for an hour or so, amused by the bustle at the small\nwayside station we had just built, and idly watching our tiny\nconstruction engine forging its way, with a great deal of clanking and\npuffing, up a steep gradient just across the river. It was touch-and-go\nwhether it would manage to get its heavy load of rails and sleepers to\nthe top of the incline or not, and I became so interested in the\ncontest between steam and friction and gravity, that I did not notice\nthat a visitor had approached and was standing quietly beside me.\n\nOn hearing the usual salutation, however, I turned round and saw a lean\nand withered half-bred Masai, clothed in a very inadequate piece of\nwildebeeste hide which was merely slipped under the left arm and looped\nup in a knot over the right shoulder. He stood for a moment with the\nright hand held out on a level with his shoulder, the fingers extended\nand the palm turned towards me--all indicating that he came on a\nfriendly visit. I returned his salutation, and asked him what he\nwanted. Before answering, he dropped down on his heels, his old bones\ncracking as he did so. \"I want to lead the Great Master to two lions,\"\nhe said; \"they have just killed a zebra and are now devouring it.\" On\nhearing this I straightway forgot that I had already done a hard day's\nwork in the full blaze of an equatorial sun; I forgot that I was tired\nand hungry; in fact, I forgot everything that was not directly\nconnected with the excitement of lion-hunting. Even the old savage at\nmy feet grinned when he saw how keen I was about it. I plied him with\nquestions--were they both lions or lionesses? had they manes? how far\naway were they? and so on. Naturally, to the last question he was bound\nto answer \"M'bali kidogo.\" Of course they were not far away; nothing\never is to a native of East Africa. However, the upshot was that in a\nvery few minutes I had a mule saddled, and with the old Masai as guide,\nstarted off accompanied by my faithful Mahina and another coolie to\nhelp to bring home the skin if I should prove successful. I also left\nword for my friend Spooner, the District Engineer, who happened to be\nabsent from camp just at the moment, that I had gone after two lions,\nbut hoped to be back by nightfall.\n\nWe travelled at a good pace, and within an hour had covered fully six\nmiles; still there was no sign of lions. On the way we were joined by\nsome Wa Kamba, even more scantily attired than our guide, and soon a\ndispute arose between these hangers-on and the old Masai, who refused\nto allow them to accompany us, as he was afraid that they would seize\nall the zebra-meat that the lions had not already eaten. However, I\ntold him not to bother, but to hurry up and show me the lions, and that\nI would look after him all right. Eventually, on getting to the low\ncrest of one of the long swells in the ground, our guide extended a\nlong skinny finger and said proudly, \"Tazama, Bwana\" (\"See, Master\"). I\nlooked in the direction in which he pointed, and sure enough, about six\nhundred yards off were a lion and a lioness busily engaged on the\ncarcase of a zebra. On using my field-glasses, I was amused to observe\na jackal in attendance on the pair. Every now and then he would come\ntoo close to the zebra, when the lion would make a short rush at him\nand scare him away. The little jackal looked most ridiculous,\nscampering off before the huge beast with his tail well down; but no\nsooner did the lion stop and return to his meal than he crept nearer\nagain. The natives say, by the way, that a lion will eat every kind of\nanimal--including even other lions--except a jackal or a hyena. I was\nalso interested to notice the way in which the lion got at the flesh of\nthe zebra; he took a short run at the body, and putting his claws well\ninto the skin, in this manner tore off great strips of the hide.\n\nWhile I was thus studying the picture, my followers became impatient at\nmy inactivity, and coming up to the top of the rise, showed themselves\non the sky-line. The lions saw them at once, turning round and standing\nerect to stare at them. There was not an atom of cover to be seen, nor\nany chance of taking advantage of the rolling ground, for it did not\nslope in the required direction; so I started to walk in the open in a\nsidelong direction towards the formidable-looking pair. They allowed me\nto come a hundred yards or so nearer them, and then the lioness bolted,\nthe lion following her at a more leisurely trot. As soon as they left\nthe body of the zebra, my African following made a rush for it, and\nbegan a fierce fight over the remains, so that I had to restore order\nand leave a coolie to see that our guide got the large share, as he\ndeserved. In the meantime the lion, hearing the noise of the squabble,\nhalted on the crest of the hill to take a deliberate look at me, and\nthen disappeared over the brow. I jumped on to my mule and galloped as\nhard as I could after him, and luckily found the pair still in sight\nwhen I reached the top of the rise. As soon as they saw me following\nthem up, the lioness took covert in some long grass that almost\nconcealed her when she lay down, but the lion continued to move\nsteadily away. Accordingly I made for a point which would bring me\nabout two hundred yards to the right of the lioness, and which would\nleave a deep natural hollow between us, so as to give me a better\nchance, in the event of a charge, of bowling her over as she came up\nthe rise towards me. I could plainly make out her light-coloured form\nin the grass, and took careful aim and fired. In an instant she was\nkicking on her back and tossing about, evidently hard hit; in a few\nseconds more she lay perfectly still, and I saw that she was dead.\n\nI now turned my attention to the lion, who meanwhile had disappeared\nover another rise. By this time Mahina and the other Indian, with three\nor four of the disappointed Wa Kamba, had come up, so we started off in\na body in pursuit of him. I felt sure that he was lurking somewhere in\nthe grass not far off, and I knew that I could depend upon the native\neye to find him if he showed so much as the tip of his ear. Nor was I\ndisappointed, for we had scarcely topped the next rise when one of the\nWa Kamba spotted the dark brown head of the brute as he raised it for\nan instant above the grass in order to watch us. We pretended not to\nhave seen him, however, and advanced to within two hundred yards or so,\nwhen, as he seemed to be getting uneasy, I thought it best to risk a\nshot even at this range. I put up the 200-yards sight and the bullet\nfell short; but the lion never moved. Raising the sight another fifty\nyards, I rested the rifle on Mahina's back for the next shot, and again\nmissed; fortunately, however, the lion still remained quiet. I then\ndecided to put into practice the scheme I had thought out the day I sat\nastride the lion I had killed on the Kapiti Plain: so I told all my\nfollowers to move off to the right, taking the mule with them, and to\nmake a half-circle round the animal, while I lay motionless in the\ngrass and waited. The ruse succeeded admirably, for as the men moved\nround so did the lion, offering me at last a splendid shoulder shot. I\ntook very careful, steady aim and fired, with the result that he rolled\nover and over, and then made one or two attempts to get up but failed.\nI then ran up to within a few yards of him, and--helpless as he was\nwith a bullet through both shoulders--he was still game, and twist\nround so as to face me, giving vent all the time to savage growls. A\nfinal shot laid him out, however, and we at once proceeded to skin him.\nWhile we were busy doing this, one of the Wa Kamba suddenly drew my\nattention to the fact that we were actually being stalked at that very\nmoment by two other lions, who eventually approached to within five\nhundred yards' distance and then lay down to watch us skinning their\ndead brother, their big shaggy heads rising every now and again above\nthe grass to give us a prolonged stare. At the time I little knew what\na stirring adventure was in store for me next day while in pursuit of\nthese same brutes.\n\nIt was almost dark when the skinning process was finished, so without\ndelay we started on our way back to camp, which was about seven miles\noff. The lioness I thought I should leave to be skinned the next day;\nbut the men I sent out to do the job on the morrow were unable to find\nany trace of her--they probably missed the place where she lay, for I\nam sure that I killed her. It was a good two hours after night had\nfallen before we got anywhere near the railway, and the last few miles\nI was obliged to do by the guidance of the stars. Tramping over the\nplain on a pitch-dark night, with lions and rhino all about, was by no\nmeans pleasant work and I heartily wished myself and my men safely back\nin camp. Indeed, I was beginning to think that I must have lost my\nbearings and was getting anxious about it, when to my relief I heard a\nrifle shot about half a mile ahead of us. I guessed at once that it was\nfired by my good friend Spooner in order to guide me, so I gave a reply\nsignal; and on getting to the top of the next rise, I saw the plain in\nfront of me all twinkling with lights. When he found that I had not\nreturned by nightfall, Spooner had become nervous about me, and fearing\nthat I had met with some mishap, had come out with a number of the\nworkmen in camp to search for me in the direction I had taken in the\nafternoon. He was delighted to find me safe and sound and with a lion's\nskin as a trophy, while I was equally glad to have his escort and\ncompany back to camp, which was still over a mile away.\n\nWhen we had settled down comfortably to dinner that night, I fired\nSpooner's sporting ardour by telling him of the fine pair of lions who\nhad watched us skinning their companion, and we agreed at once to go\nout next day and try to bag them both. Spooner and I had often had many\nfriendly arguments in regard to the comparative courage of the lion and\nthe tiger, he holding the view that \"Stripes\" was the more formidable\nfoe, while I, though admitting to the full-the courage of the tiger,\nmaintained from lively personal experience that the lion when once\nroused was unequalled for pluck and daring, and was in fact the most\ndangerous enemy one could meet with. He may at times slink off and not\nshow fight; but get him in the mood, or wound him, and only his death\nor yours will end the fray--that, at least, was my experience of East\nAfrican lions. I think that Spooner has now come round to my opinion,\nhis conversion taking place the next day in a very melancholy manner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nBHOOTA'S LAST SHIKAR\n\n\nLong after I had retired to rest that night I lay awake listening to\nroar answering roar in every direction round our camp, and realised\nthat we were indeed in the midst of a favourite haunt of the king of\nbeasts. It is one thing to hear a lion in captivity, when one knows he\nis safe behind iron bars; but quite another to listen to him when he is\nramping around in the vicinity of one's fragile tent, which with a\nsingle blow he could tear to pieces. Still, all this roaring was of\ngood omen for the next day's sport.\n\nAccording to our over-night arrangement, we were up betimes in the\nmorning, but as there was a great deal of work to be done before we\ncould get away, it was quite midday before we made ready to start. I\nought to mention before going further that as a rule Spooner declined\nmy company on shooting trips, as he was convinced that I should get\n\"scuppered\" sooner or later if I persisted in going after lions with a\n\"popgun,\" as he contemptuously termed my .303. Indeed, this was rather\na bone of contention between us, he being a firm believer (and rightly)\nin a heavy, weapon for big and dangerous game, while I always did my\nbest to defend the .303 which I was in the habit of using. On this\noccasion we effected a compromise for the day, I accepting the loan of\nhis spare 12-bore rifle as a second gun in case I should get to close\nquarters. But my experience has been that it is always a very dangerous\nthing to rely on a borrowed gun or rifle, unless it has precisely the\nsame action as one's own; and certainly in this instance it almost\nproved disastrous.\n\nHaving thus seen to our rifles and ammunition and taken care also that\nsome brandy was put in the luncheon-basket in case of an accident, we\nset off early in the afternoon in Spooner's tonga, which is a\ntwo-wheeled cart with a hood over it. The party consisted of Spooner\nand myself, Spooner's Indian shikari Bhoota, my own gun-boy Mahina, and\ntwo other Indians, one of whom, Imam Din, rode in the tonga, while the\nother led a spare horse called \"Blazeaway.\" Now it may seem a strange\nplan to go lion-hunting in a tonga, but there is no better way of\ngetting about country like the Athi Plains, where--so long as it is\ndry--there is little or nothing to obstruct wheeled traffic. Once\nstarted, we rattled over the smooth expanse at a good rate, and on the\nway bagged a hartebeeste and a couple of gazelle, as fresh meat was\nbadly needed in camp; besides, they offered most tempting shots, for\nthey stood stock-still gazing at us, struck no doubt by the novel\nappearance of our conveyance. Next we came upon a herd of wildebeeste,\nand here we allowed Bhoota, who was a wary shikari and an old servant\nof Spooner's, to stalk a solitary bull. He was highly pleased at this\nfavour, and did the job admirably.\n\nAt last we reached the spot where I had seen the two lions on the\nprevious day--a slight hollow, covered with long grass; but there was\nnow no trace of them to be discovered, so we moved further on and had\nanother good beat round. After some little time the excitement began by\nour spying the black-tipped ears of a lioness projecting above the\ngrass, and the next moment a very fine lion arose from beside her and\ngave us a full view of his grand head and mane. After staring fixedly\nat us in an inquiring sort of way as we slowly advanced upon them, they\nboth turned and slowly trotted off, the lion stopping every now and\nagain to gaze round in our direction. Very imposing and majestic he\nlooked, too, as he thus turned his great shaggy head defiantly towards\nus, and Spooner had to admit that it was the finest sight he had ever\nseen. For a while we followed them on foot; but finding at length that\nthey were getting away from us and would soon be lost to sight over a\nbit of rising ground, we jumped quickly into the tonga and galloped\nround the base of the knoll so as to cut off their retreat, the\nexcitement of the rough and bumpy ride being intensified a hundred-fold\nby the probability of our driving slap into the pair on rounding the\nrise. On getting to the other side, however, they were nowhere to be\nseen, so we drove on as hard as we could to the top, whence we caught\nsight of them about four hundred yards away. As there seemed to be no\nprospect of getting nearer we decided to open fire at this range, and\nat the third shot the lioness tumbled over to my .303. At first I\nthought I had done for her, as for a few minutes she lay on the ground\nkicking and struggling; but in the end, although evidently badly hit,\nshe rose to her feet and followed the lion, who had escaped uninjured,\ninto some long grass from which we could not hope to dislodge them.\n\nAs it was now late in the afternoon, and as there seemed no possibility\nof inducing the lions to leave the thicket in which they had concealed\nthemselves, we turned back towards camp, intending to come out again\nthe next day to track the wounded lioness. I was now riding \"Blazeaway\"\nand was trotting along in advance of the tonga, when suddenly he shied\nbadly at a hyena, which sprang up out of the grass almost from beneath\nhis feet and quickly scampered off. I pulled up for a moment and sat\nwatching the hyena's ungainly bounds, wondering whether he were worth a\nshot. Suddenly I felt \"Blazeaway\" trembling violently beneath me, and\non looking over my left shoulder to discover the reason, I was startled\nto see two fine lions not more than a hundred yards away, evidently the\npair which I had seen the day before and which we had really come in\nsearch of. They looked as if they meant to dispute our passage, for\nthey came slowly towards me for about ten yards or so and then lay\ndown, watching me steadily all the time. I called out to Spooner, \"Here\nare the lions I told you about,\" and he whipped up the ponies and in a\nmoment or two was beside me with the tonga.\n\nBy this time I had seized my .303 and dismounted, so we at once\ncommenced a cautious advance on the crouching lions, the arrangement\nbeing that Spooner was to take the right-hand one and I the other. We\nhad got to within sixty yards' range without incident and were just\nabout to sit down comfortably to \"pot\" them, when they suddenly\nsurprised us by turning and bolting off. I managed, however, to put a\nbullet into the one I had marked just as he crested a bank, and he\nlooked very grand as he reared up against the sky and clawed the air on\nfeeling the lead. For a second or two he gave me the impression that he\nwas about to charge; but luckily he changed his mind and followed his\ncompanion, who had so far escaped scot free. I immediately mounted\n\"Blazeaway\" and galloped off in hot pursuit, and after about half a\nmile of very stiff going got up with them once more. Finding now that\nthey could not get away, they halted; came to bay and then charged down\nupon me, the wounded lion leading. I had left my rifle behind, so all I\ncould do was to turn and fly as fast as \"Blazeaway\" could go, praying\ninwardly the while that he would not put his foot into a hole. When the\nlions saw that they were unable to overtake me, they gave up the chase\nand lay down again, the wounded one being about two hundred yards in\nfront of the other. At once I pulled up too, and then went back a\nlittle way, keeping a careful eye upon them; and I continued these\ntactics of riding up and down at a respectful distance until Spooner\ncame up with the rifles, when we renewed the attack.\n\nAs a first measure I thought it advisable to disable the unhurt lion if\npossible, and, still using the .303, I got him with the second shot at\na range of about three hundred yards. He seemed badly hit, for he\nsprang into the air and apparently fell heavily. I then exchanged my\n.303 for Spooner's spare 12-bore rifle, and we turned our attention to\nthe nearer lion, who all this time had been lying perfectly still,\nwatching our movements closely, and evidently just waiting to be down\nupon us the moment we came within charging distance. He was never given\nthis opportunity, however, for we did not approach nearer than ninety\nyards, when Spooner sat down comfortably and knocked him over quite\ndead with one shot from his .577, the bullet entering the left shoulder\nobliquely and passing through the heart.\n\nIt was now dusk, and there was no time to be lost if we meant to bag\nthe second lion as well. We therefore resumed our cautious advance,\nmoving to the right, as we went, so as to get behind us what light\nthere was remaining. The lion of course twisted round in the grass in\nsuch a way as always to keep facing us, and looked very ferocious, so\nthat I was convinced that unless he were entirely disabled by the first\nshot he would be down on us like a whirlwind. All the same, I felt\nconfident that, even in this event, one of us would succeed in stopping\nhim before he could do any damage; but in this I was unfortunately to\nbe proved mistaken.\n\nEventually we managed to get within eighty yards of the enraged animal,\nI being about five yards to the left front of Spooner, who was followed\nby Bhoota at about the same distance to his right rear. By this time\nthe lion was beside himself with fury, growling savagely and raising\nquite a cloud of dust by lashing his tail against the ground. It was\nclearly high time that we did something, so asking Spooner to fire,\ndropped on one knee and waited. Nor was I kept long in suspense, for\nthe moment Spooner's shot rang out, up jumped the lion and charged down\nin a bee-line for me, coming in long, low bounds at great speed. I\nfired the right barrel at about fifty yards, but apparently missed; the\nleft at about half that range, still without stopping effect. I knew\nthen that there was no time reload, so remained kneeling, expecting him\nto be on me the next moment. Suddenly, just as he was within a bound of\nme, he made a quick turn, to my right. \"Good heavens,\" I thought, \"he\nis going for Spooner.\" I was wrong in this, however, for like a flash\nhe passed Spooner also, and with a last tremendous bound seized Bhoota\nby the leg and rolled over and over with him for some yards in the\nimpetus of the rush. Finally he stood over him and tried to seize him\nby the throat, which the brave fellow prevented by courageously\nstuffing his left arm right into the great jaws. Poor Bhoota! By moving\nat the critical moment, he had diverted the lion's attention from me\nand had drawn the whole fury of the charge on to himself.\n\nAll this, of course, happened in only a second or two. In the short\ninstant that intervened, I felt a cartridge thrust into my hand by\nSpooner's plucky servant, Imam Din, who had carried the 12-bore all day\nand who had stuck to me gallantly throughout the charge; and shoving it\nin, I rushed as quickly as I could to Bhoota's rescue. Meanwhile,\nSpooner had got there before me and when I came up actually had his\nleft hand on the lion's flank, in a vain attempt to push him off\nBhoota's prostrate body and so get at the heavy rifle which the poor\nfellow still stoutly clutched. The lion, however, was so busily engaged\nmauling Bhoota's arm that he paid not the slightest attention to\nSpooner's efforts. Unfortunately, as he was facing straight in my\ndirection, I had to move up in full view of him, and the moment I\nreached his head, he stopped chewing the arm, though still holding it\nin his mouth, and threw himself back on his haunches, preparing for a\nspring, at the same time curling back his lips and exposing his long\ntusks in a savage snarl. I knew then that I had not a moment to spare,\nso I threw the rifle up to my shoulder and pulled the trigger. Imagine\nmy utter despair and horror when it did not go off! \"Misfire again,\" I\nthought, and my heart almost stopped beating. As took a step backwards,\nI felt it was all over no for he would never give me time to extract\nthe cartridge and load again. Still I took another step backwards,\nkeeping my eyes fixed on the lion's, which were blazing with rage; and\nin the middle of my third step, just as the brute was gathering himself\nfor his spring, it suddenly struck me that in my haste and excitement,\nI had forgotten that I was using a borrowed rifle and had not pulled\nback the hammer (my own was hammerless). To do this and put a bullet\nthrough the lion's brain was then the work of a moment; and he fell\ndead instantly right on the top of Bhoota.\n\nWe did not lose a moment in rolling his great carcase off Bhoota's body\nand quickly forced opening the jaws so as to disengage the mangled arm\nwhich still remained in his mouth. By this time the poor shikari was in\na fainting condition, and we flew to the tonga for the brandy flask\nwhich we had so providentially brought with us. On making a rough\nexamination of the wounded man, we found that his left arm and right\nleg were both frightfully mauled, the latter being broken as well. He\nwas lifted tenderly into the tonga--how thankful we now were to have it\nwith us!--and Spooner at once set off with him to camp and the doctor.\n\nBefore following them home I made a hasty examination of the dead lion\nand found him to be a very good specimen in every way. I was\nparticularly satisfied to see that one of the two shots I had fired as\nhe charged down upon me had taken effect. The bullet had entered below\nthe right eye, and only just missed the brain. Unfortunately it was a\nsteel one which Spooner had unluckily brought in his ammunition bag by\nmistake; still one would have thought that a shot of this kind, even\nwith a hard bullet, would at least have checked the lion for the\nmoment. As a matter of fact, however, it went clean through him without\nhaving the slightest stopping effect. My last bullet, which was of soft\nlead, had entered close to the right eye and embedded itself in the\nbrain. By this time it had grown almost dark, so I left the two dead\nlions where they lay and rode for camp, which I was lucky enough to\nreach without further adventure or mishap. I may mention here that\nearly next morning two other lions were found devouring the one we had\nfirst shot; but they had not had time to do much damage, and the head,\nwhich I have had mounted, makes a very fine trophy indeed. The lion\nthat mauled Bhoota was untouched.\n\nOn my arrival in camp I found that everything that was possible was\nbeing done for poor Bhoota by Dr. McCulloch, the same who had travelled\nup with me to Tsavo and shot the ostrich from the train on my first\narrival in the country, and who was luckily on the spot. His wounds had\nbeen skilfully dressed, the broken leg put in splints, and under the\ninfluence of a soothing draught the poor fellow was soon sleeping\npeacefully. At first we had great hope of saving both life and limb,\nand certainly for some days he seemed to be getting on as well as could\nbe expected. The wounds, however, were very bad ones, especially those\non the leg where the long tusks had met through and through the flesh,\nleaving over a dozen deep tooth marks; the arm, though dreadfully\nmauled, soon healed. It was wonderful to notice how cheerfully the old\nshikari, bore it all, and a pleasure to listen to his tale of how he\nwould have his revenge on the whole tribe of lions as soon as he was\nable to get about again. But alas, his shikar was over. The leg got\nrapidly worse, and mortification setting in, it had to be amputated\nhalf way up the thigh.\n\nDr. Winston Waters performed the operation most skilfully, and\ncuriously enough the operating table was canopied with the skin of the\nlion which had been responsible for the injury. Bhoota made a good\nrecovery from the operation, but seemed to lose heart when he found\nthat he had only one leg left, as according to his ideas he had now but\na poor chance of being allowed to enter Heaven. We did all that was\npossible for him, and Spooner especially could not have looked after a\nbrother more tenderly; but to our great sorrow he sank gradually, and\ndied on July 19.\n\nThe hunt which had such a disastrous sequel proved to be the last\noccasion on which I met a lion in the open, as we got out of the\nhunting country shortly afterwards and for the rest of my stay in East\nAfrica I had too much work to do to be able to go any distance in\nsearch of big game.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nA MAN-EATER IN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE\n\n\nTowards the end of my stay in British East Africa, I dined one evening\nwith Mr. Ryall, the Superintendent of the Police, in his inspection\ncarriage on the railway. Poor Ryall! I little thought then what a\nterrible fate was to overtake him only a few months later in that very\ncarriage in which we dined.\n\nA man-eating lion had taken up his quarters at a little roadside\nstation called Kimaa, and had developed an extraordinary taste for the\nmembers of the railway staff. He was a most daring brute, quite\nindifferent as to whether he carried off the station-master, the\nsignalman, or the pointsman; and one night, in his efforts to obtain a\nmeal, he actually climbed up on to the roof of the station buildings\nand tried to tear off the corrugated-iron sheets. At this the terrified\nbaboo in charge of the telegraph instrument below sent the following\nlaconic message to the Traffic Manager: \"Lion fighting with station.\nSend urgent succour.\" Fortunately he was not victorious in his \"fight\nwith the station\"; but he tried so hard to get in that he cut his feet\nbadly on the iron sheeting, leaving large blood-stains on the roof.\nAnother night, however, he succeeded in carrying off the native driver\nof the pumping-engine, and soon afterwards added several other victims\nto his list. On one occasion an engine-driver arranged to sit up all\nnight in a large iron water-tank in the hope of getting a shot at him,\nand had a loop-hole cut in the side of the tank from which to fire. But\nas so often happens, the hunter became the hunted; the lion turned up\nin the middle of the night, overthrew the tank and actually tried to\ndrag the driver out through the narrow circular hole in the top through\nwhich he had squeezed in. Fortunately the tank was just too deep for\nthe brute to be able to reach the man at the bottom; but the latter was\nnaturally half paralysed with fear and had to crouch so low down as to\nbe unable to take anything like proper aim. He fired, however, and\nsucceeded in frightening the lion away for the time being.\n\nIt was in a vain attempt to destroy this pest that poor Ryall met his\ntragic and untimely end. On June 6, 1900, he was travelling up in his\ninspection carriage from Makindu to Nairobi, accompanied by two\nfriends, Mr. Huebner and Mr. Parenti. When they reached Kimaa, which is\nabout two hundred and fifty miles from Mombasa, they were told that the\nman-eater had been seen close to the station only a short time before\ntheir train arrived, so they at once made up their minds to remain\nthere for the night and endeavour to shoot him. Ryall's carriage was\naccordingly detached from the train and shunted into a siding close to\nthe station, where, owing to the unfinished state of the line, it did\nnot stand perfectly level, but had a pronounced list to one side. In\nthe afternoon the three friends went out to look for the lion, but,\nfinding no traces of him whatever, they returned to the carriage for\ndinner. Afterwards they all sat up on guard for some time; but the only\nnoticeable thing they saw was what they took to be two very bright and\nsteady glow-worms. After-events proved that these could have been\nnothing else than the eyes of the man-eater steadily watching them all\nthe time and studying their every movement. The hour now growing late,\nand there being apparently no sign of the lion, Ryall persuaded his two\nfriends to lie down, while he kept the first watch. Huebner occupied\nthe high berth over the table on the one side of the carriage, the only\nother berth being on the opposite side of the compartment and lower\ndown. This Ryall offered to Parenti, who declined it, saying that he\nwould be quite comfortable on the floor and he accordingly lay down to\nsleep, with his feet towards the sliding door which gave admission the\ncarriage.\n\nIt is supposed that Ryall, after watching for some considerable time,\nmust have come to the conclusion that the lion was not going to make\nits appearance that night, for he lay down on the lower berth and dozed\noff. No sooner had he done so, doubtless, than the cunning man-eater\nbegan cautiously to stalk the three sleepers. In order to reach the\nlittle platform at the end of the carriage, he had to mount two very\nhigh steps from the railway line, but these he managed to negotiate\nsuccessfully and in silence. The door from this platform into the\ncarriage was a sliding one on wheels, which ran very easily on a brass\nrunner; and as it was probably not quite shut, or at any rate not\nsecured in any way, it was an easy matter for the lion to thrust in a\npaw and shove it open. But owing to the tilt of the carriage and to his\ngreat extra weight on the one side, the door slid to and snapped into\nthe lock the moment he got his body right in, thus leaving him shut up\nwith the three sleeping me in the compartment.\n\nHe sprang at once at Ryall, but in order to reach him had actually to\nplant his feet on Parenti, who, it will be remembered, was sleeping on\nthe floor. At this moment Huebner was suddenly awakened by a loud cry,\nand on looking down from his berth was horrified to see an enormous\nlion standing with his hind feet on Parenti's body, while his forepaws\nrested on poor Ryall. Small wonder that he was panic-stricken at the\nsight. There was only one possible way of escape, and that was through\nthe second sliding door communicating with the servants' quarters,\nwhich was opposite to that by which the lion had entered. But in order\nto reach this door Huebner had literally to jump on to the man-eater's\nback, for its great bulk filled up all the space beneath his berth. It\nsounds scarcely credible, but it appears that in the excitement and\nhorror of the moment he actually did this, and fortunately the lion was\ntoo busily engaged with his victim to pay any attention to him. So he\nmanaged to reach the door in safety; but there, to his dismay, he found\nthat it was held fast on the other side by the terrified coolies, who\nhad been aroused by the disturbance caused by the lion's entrance. In\nutter desperation he made frantic efforts to open it, and exerting all\nhis strength at last managed to pull it back sufficiently far to allow\nhim to squeeze through, when the trembling coolies instantly tied it up\nagain with their turbans. A moment afterwards a great crash was heard,\nand the whole carriage lurched violently to one side; the lion had\nbroken through one of the windows, carrying off poor Ryall with him.\nBeing now released, Parenti lost no time in jumping through the window\non the opposite side of the carriage, and fled for refuge to one of the\nstation buildings; his escape was little short of miraculous, as the\nlion had been actually standing on him as he lay on the floor. The\ncarriage itself was badly shattered, and the wood-work of the window\nhad been broken to pieces by the passage of the lion as he sprang\nthrough with his victim in his mouth.\n\nAll that can be hoped is that poor Ryall's death was instantaneous. His\nremains were found next morning about a quarter of a mile away in the\nbush, and were taken to Nairobi for burial. I am glad to be able to add\nthat very shortly afterwards the terrible brute who was responsible for\nthis awful tragedy was caught in an ingenious trap constructed by one\nof the railway staff. He was kept on view for several days, and then\nshot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nWORK AT NAIROBI\n\n\nAlthough the lion which caused poor Bhoota's death was the last I\nmanaged to shoot in East Africa, I saw several others afterwards while\ntravelling up and down the line at different times on construction\nwork. In particular, I remember one very curious incident which\nhappened early on the morning of June 2, when I was travelling towards\nNairobi, accompanied by Dr. McCulloch. The Doctor was going home on\nleave in the course of a few days, and was bemoaning to me his bad luck\nin never having shot or even seen a lion all the time he had been in\nthe country. We were standing on the engine at the time, facing each\nother, he with his back to the north.\n\n\"My dear Mac,\" I said, \"it is because you don't look out for them.\"\n\n\"Rubbish,\" he retorted; \"I do nothing else when I am out hunting.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"are you really very anxious to shoot one before you\ngo home?\"\n\n\"I would rather get a lion than anything else in the world,\" was the\nemphatic reply.\n\n\"Very good, then. Sultan,\" I called to the driver, \"stop the engine.\"\n\n\"Now, Mac,\" I continued, as the train was quickly brought to a\nstandstill, \"here's a chance for you. Just jump off and bag those two\nover there.\"\n\nHe turned round in blank astonishment and could hardly believe his eyes\nwhen he saw two fine lions only about two hundred yards off, busily\nengaged in devouring a wildebeeste which they had evidently just\nkilled. I had spotted them almost as soon as Mac had begun to talk of\nhis bad luck, and had only waited to tell him until we got nearer, so\nas to give him a greater surprise. He was off the engine in a second\nand made directly for the two beasts. Just as he was about to fire one\nof them bolted, so I called out to him to shoot the other quickly\nbefore he too made good his escape. This one was looking at us over his\nshoulder with one paw on the dead wildebeeste, and while he stood in\nthis attitude Mac dropped him with a bullet through the heart. Needless\nto say he was tremendously delighted with his success, and after the\ndead lion had been carried to the train and propped up against a\ncarriage, I took a photograph of him standing beside his fine trophy.\n\nThree days after this incident railhead reached Nairobi, and I was\ngiven charge of the new division of the line. Nairobi was to be the\nheadquarters of the Railway Administration, so there was an immense\namount of work to be done in converting an absolutely bare plain, three\nhundred and twenty-seven miles from the nearest place where even a nail\ncould be purchased, into a busy railway centre. Roads and bridges had\nto be constructed, houses and work-shops built, turntables and station\nquarters erected, a water supply laid on, and a hundred and one other\nthings done which go to the making of a railway township. Wonderfully\nsoon, however, the nucleus of the present town began to take shape, and\na thriving \"bazaar\" sprang into existence with a mushroom-like growth.\nIn this, however, a case or two of plague broke out before very long,\nso I gave the natives and Indians who inhabited it an hour's notice to\nclear out, and on my own responsibility promptly burned the whole place\nto the ground. For this somewhat arbitrary proceeding I was mildly\ncalled over the coals, as I expected; but all the same it effectually\nstamped out the plague, which did not reappear during the time I was in\nthe country.\n\nWith a little persuasion I managed to induce several hundred of the Wa\nKikuyu, in whose country we now were, to come and work at Nairobi, and\nvery useful and capable they proved themselves after a little training.\nThey frequently brought me in word that the shambas (plantations,\ngardens) at the back of the hill on which my camp was pitched were\nbeing destroyed by elephants, but unfortunately I could never spare\ntime to go out in quest of them. On one occasion, however, I passed the\nnews on to my friend, Dr. Winston Waters, with the result that he had a\nmost exciting adventure with a big bull elephant. He set out in quest\nof the depredator, and, guided by a few of the Wa Kikuyu, soon came\nupon him hidden among some shady trees. Waters was a great believer in\na close shot, so he stalked up to within a few yards of the animal and\nthen fired his .577, aiming for the heart. The elephant responded by a\nprompt and determined charge, and although Waters quickly let him have\nthe left barrel as well, it proved of no effect; and on he came,\nscreaming and trumpeting with rage. There was nothing for it,\ntherefore, but to fly for dear life; so down a path raced Waters for\nall he was worth, the elephant giving vigorous chase and gaining\nrapidly. In a few seconds matters began to look very serious for the\nsportsman, for the huge monster was almost on him; but at the critical\nmoment he stepped on to the false cover of a carefully-concealed game\npit and disappeared from view as if by magic. This sudden descent of\nhis enemy apparently into the bowels of the earth so startled the\nelephant that he stopped short in his career and made off into the\njungle. As for Waters, he was luckily none the worse for his fall, as\nthe pit was neither staked at the bottom nor very deep; he soon\nscrambled out, and, following up the wounded elephant, succeeded in\nfinishing him off without further trouble.\n\nTowards the end of 1899 I left for England. A few days before I started\nall my Wa Kikuyu \"children\", as they called themselves, came in a body\nand begged to be taken with me. I pictured to them the cold, wet\nclimate of England and its great distance from their native land; but\nthey assured me that these were nothing to them, as they only wished to\ncontinue my \"children\" and to go wherever I went. I could hardly\nimagine myself arriving in London with a body-guard of four hundred\nmore or less naked savages, but it was only with difficulty that I\npersuaded them that they had better remain in their own country. The\never-faithful Mahina, my \"boy\" Roshan Khan, my honest chaukidar,\nMeeanh, and a few other coolies who had been a long time with me,\naccompanied me to the coast, where they bade me a sorrowful farewell\nand left for India the day before I sailed on my homeward journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE FINDING OF THE NEW ELAND\n\n\nDuring the early part of last year (1906) I revisited the scene of my\nformer labours and adventures on a shooting trip. Unfortunately the\ntrain by which I travelled up from Mombasa reached Tsavo at midnight,\nbut all the same I got out and prowled about as long as time would\npermit, half wondering every moment if the ghosts of the two man-eaters\nwould spring at me out of the bushes. I wanted very much to spend a day\nor two in the old place, but my companions were anxious to push on as\nquickly as possible to better hunting-grounds. I took the trouble,\nhowever, to wake them out of their peaceful slumbers in order to point\nout to them, by the pale moonlight, the strength and beauty of the\nTsavo bridge; but I fear this delicate little attention was scarcely\nappreciated as it deserved. Naturally I could not expect them, or\nanyone else, to view the bridge quite from my point of view; I looked\non it as a child of mine, brought up through stress and danger and\ntroubles of all kinds, but the ordinary traveller of course knows\nnothing of this and doubtless thinks it only a very commonplace and\ninsignificant structure indeed.\n\nWe spent a few days at Nairobi, now a flourishing town of some 6,000\ninhabitants, supplied with every modern comfort and luxury, including a\nwell laid-out race course; and after a short trip to Lake Victoria\nNyanza and Uganda, we made our way back to the Eldama Ravine, which\nlies some twenty miles north of Landiani Station in the province of\nNaivasha. Here we started in earnest on our big game expedition, which\nI am glad to say proved to be a most delightful and interesting one in\nevery way. The country was lovely, and the climate cool and bracing. We\nall got a fair amount of sport, our bag including rhino, hippo,\nwaterbuck, reedbuck, hartebeeste, wildebeeste, ostrich, impala, oryx,\nroan antelope, etc.; but for the present I must confine myself to a\nshort account of how I was lucky enough to shoot a specimen of an\nentirely new race of eland.\n\nOur party of five, including one lady who rode and shot equally\nstraight, left the Eldama Ravine on January 22, and trekked off in an\neasterly direction across the Laikipia Plateau. As the trail which we\nwere to take was very little known and almost impossible to follow\nwithout a guide, Mr. Foaker, the District Officer at the Ravine, very\nkindly procured us a reliable man--a young Uashin Gishu Masai named\nUliagurma. But as he could not speak a word of Swahili, we had also to\nengage an interpreter, an excellent, cheery fellow of the same tribe\nnamed Landaalu; and he in his turn possessed a kinsman who insisted on\ncoming too, although he was no earthly use to us. Our route took us\nthrough the Solai Swamp, over the Multilo and Subu Ko Lultian ranges,\nand across many unexpected rivers and streamlets. On our first march I\nnoticed that Uliagurma, our kirongozi (guide), was suffering extremely,\nthough uncomplainingly, from earache, so I told him to come to me when\nwe got to camp and I would see what I could do for him. Strange to say,\nmy doctoring proved most successful, and Uliagurma was so grateful that\nhe spread my fame as a \"medicine-man\" far and wide among the natives\nwherever we trekked. The consequence was that men, women and children\nin every state of disease and crippledom came and besieged our camps,\nbegging for some of the magical dawa (medicine). I used to do what I\ncould, and only hope I did not injure many of them; but it was\nheartrending to see some of the quite hopeless cases I was expected to\ncure.\n\nAfter we had climbed the Subu Ko Lultian and got a footing on the\nplateau, we pitched our camp on the banks of the Angarua river, where\nwe found a big Masai kraal, the inhabitants of which seemed much\nastonished at our sudden appearance in their neighbourhood. They were\nvery friendly, however, and visited our camp in swarms an hour or so\nafter our arrival. Riding my pony and accompanied by Landaalu as\ninterpreter, and my gun-bearer Juma, I returned their call in the\nafternoon, when the elmorani (warriors) gave for my entertainment an\nexhibition of the gymnastic exercises which they practise regularly in\norder more particularly to strengthen their legs and render them\nsupple. After the performance I asked if there was any game about and\nwas told that some might be found a few miles to the north of the\nkraal; so I set out at once with Landaalu and Juma to try my luck. It\nwas a perfect afternoon, and no sooner had I cleared the belt of scrub\nwhich grew round the kraal, when by the aid of my glasses I saw a herd\nof zebra and other game away in the distance, feeding peacefully on the\nrolling prairie. I made my way steadily towards them, and noticed as I\nwent that a couple of eland were gradually drawing away from the rest\nof the herd. I marked these for my own, and carefully noting the\ndirection they were taking, I dismounted and made a detour round a rise\nso as to lie in wait for them and cut them off. My plan succeeded\nadmirably, for the two fine animals continued to come straight towards\nme without suspicion, feeding quietly by the way. When they got to\nwithin eighty yards or so, I picked out the bigger head and was only\nwaiting for him to make a slight turn before pulling the trigger, when\nbang went the heavy rifle of one of my companions about half a mile\naway. In an instant the two eland had bounded off, and I decided not to\nrisk a shot, in the hope that they would soon settle down again and\ngive me another chance.\n\nMentally blessing my friend for firing at this untimely moment, I\nwatched them make for a belt of wood about a mile further on, hoping\nagainst hope that they would remain on the near side of it. No such\nluck, however, for they plunged into it and were quickly swallowed up\nout of my sight. Running to my pony, which Landaalu had dexterously\nbrought up, I galloped in the direction of the spot in the trees where\nthe eland had disappeared; but imagine my vexation when I found that I\nhad to pull up sharp on the edge of a nasty-looking swamp, which at\nfirst sight appeared too boggy and treacherous to attempt to cross. I\nrode up and down it without being able to find anything like a really\nsafe crossing place, so in desperation I at last determined to take the\nrisk of crossing it along an old rhino path where the reeds were\nflattened down. My pony floundered bravely through, and eventually\nsucceeded in getting safely to the other side. I then made my way\ncautiously through the belt of trees, and was relieved to find that it\nwas only half a mile or so broad. I dismounted as I neared the further\nside, and, tying my pony to a tree, crept quietly forward, expecting to\nsee the eland not far off; but to my disappointment there was no trace\nof game of any kind on the whole wide stretch of country that met my\nview. I therefore tried another direction, and, taking a half turn to\nmy left, made my way carefully through some open glades to the top of a\nlittle rise not far off.\n\nThe sight that now met my eyes fairly took my breath away; for there,\nnot three hundred yards off and stalking placidly along at a slow walk,\nwas a herd of fully a hundred eland of all ages and sizes. The rear of\nthe column was brought up by a magnificent old bull, and my heart\njumped for joy as I watched him from the shelter of the bushes behind\nwhich I lay concealed. The next thing to be done was to decide on a\nplan of attack, and this had to be thought of without loss of time, for\nthe wind was blowing from me almost in the direction of the eland, who\nwould certainly scent me very soon if I did not get away. Quickly\nnoting the direction in which they were moving, I saw that if all went\nwell they ought to pass close to a little hillock about a mile or so\noff; and if I were very sharp about it, I thought I could make a\ncircuit through the wood and be on this rise, in a good position for\nboth wind and cover, before the herd could reach it. Accordingly I\ncrept away with the object of finding my mount, but to my delight--just\nbehind me and well hidden--stood the undefeated Landaalu, who in some\nmysterious way had followed me up, found the pony where I had left it\ntied to a tree, and brought it on to me. With a bright grin on his face\nhe thrust the reins into my hand, and I was up and galloping off in an\ninstant.\n\nI soon discovered that I had further to go than I expected, for I was\nforced to make a big detour in order to keep out of sight of the herd;\nbut on halting once or twice and peeping through the trees I saw that\nall was going well and that they were still calmly moving on in the\nright direction. The last quarter of a mile had to be negotiated in the\nopen, but I found that by lying flat down on my pony's back I was\ncompletely hidden from the advancing herd by an intervening swell in\nthe ground. In this manner I managed to get unobserved to the lee of my\nhillock, where I dismounted, threw the reins over a stump, and crawled\nstealthily but as quickly as I could to the top. I was in great doubt\nas to whether I should be in time or not, but on peering, hatless, over\nthe crest, I was overjoyed to find the whole herd just below me. One of\nthe eland, not twenty yards off, saw me at once, and stood still to\ngaze at me in astonishment. It was a female, however, so I took no\nnotice of her, but looked round to see if my great bull were anywhere\nnear. Yes, there he was; he had passed the spot where I lay, but was\nnot more than forty yards off, moving in the same leisurely fashion as\nwhen I first saw him. An instant later, he noticed the general alarm\ncaused by my appearance, and stopped and turned half round to see what\nwas the matter. This gave me my opportunity, so I fired, aiming behind\nthe shoulder. The way in which he jumped and kicked on feeling the lead\ntold me I had hit him hard, and I got two more bullets into him from\nthe magazine of my .303 before he managed to gain the shelter of a\nneighbouring thicket and was lost to sight. In the meantime the whole\nherd had thundered off at full gallop, disappearing in a few minutes in\na cloud of dust.\n\nI was confident that there would be little difficulty in finding the\nwounded eland, and on Landaalu coming up--which, by the way, he did\nalmost immediately, for he was a wonderful goer--we started to make a\nrough search through the thicket. Owing to the growing darkness,\nhowever, we met with no success, so I decided to return to camp, which\nwas many miles away, and to resume the quest at daybreak the following\nmorning. It turned out that we were even further from home than I\nthought, and black night came upon us before we had covered a quarter\nof the distance. Fortunately the invaluable Landaalu had discovered a\ngood crossing over the swamp, so we were able to press on at a good\npace without losing any time in overcoming the obstacle. After an hour\nor so of hard travelling, we were delighted to see a rocket go up,\nfired by my friends to guide us on our way. Such a sight is wonderfully\ncheering when one is far away from camp, trudging along in the inky\ndarkness and none too certain of one's direction; and a rocket\nequipment should invariably be carried by the traveller in the wilds.\nSeveral more were sent up before we got anywhere near camp, and I\nremarked to Landaalu that we must have gone a very long way after the\neland. \"Long way,\" he replied; \"why, Master, we have been to Baringo!\"\nThis lake as a matter of fact was fully fifty miles away. When finally\nwe arrived I fired the ardour of my companions by relating the\nadventures of the afternoon and telling them of the wonderful herd I\nhad seen; and it was at once agreed that we should stay where we were\nfor a day or two in the hope of good sport being obtained.\n\nAs soon as it was daylight the next morning I sent out a party of our\nporters with full instructions where to find my eland, which I was sure\nmust be lying somewhere in the thicket close to the hill from where I\nhad shot him; and very shortly afterwards we ourselves made a start.\nAfter a couple of hours' travelling we were lucky enough to catch sight\nof a portion of the herd of eland, when we dismounted and stalked them\ncarefully through the long grass. All of a sudden one popped up its\nhead unexpectedly about fifty yards away. One of my companions\nimmediately levelled his rifle at it, but from where I was I could see\nbetter than he that the head was a poor one, and so called out to him\nnot to fire. The warning came too late, however, for at that moment he\npulled the trigger. It was rather a difficult shot, too, as the body of\nthe animal could not be seen very well owing to the height of the\ngrass; still, as the head instantly disappeared we hoped for the best\nand ran up to the place, but no trace of the eland could be found.\nAccordingly we pushed on again and after a little rested for a short\ntime under the shade of some trees. We had gone about three miles after\nresuming our search for game, when one of the porters remembered that\nhe had left the water-bottle he was carrying at the trees where we had\nhalted, so he was sent back for it with strict injunctions to make\nhaste and to rejoin us as quickly as possible. Curiously enough, this\ntrifling incident proved quite providential; for the porter (whose name\nwas Sabaki), after recovering the water-bottle, found himself unable to\ntrace us through the jungle and accordingly struck home for camp. On\nhis way back he actually stumbled over the dead body of the eland which\nI had shot the previous day and which the search party I had sent out\nin the morning had failed to find. They were still looking for it close\nat hand, however, so Sabaki hailed them and they at once set to work to\nskin and cut up the animal, and then carried it to the camp.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, we knew nothing of all this, and continued our\nhunt for game. Shortly after noon we had a light lunch, and while we\nwere eating it our guides, Uliagurma and Landaalu, discovered a bees'\nnest in a fallen tree and proceeded to try to extract the honey, of\nwhich the Masai are very fond. This interference was naturally strongly\nresented by the bees, and soon the semi-naked youths ran flying past us\nwith the angry swarm in full pursuit. I laughed heartily at Landaalu,\nand chaffed him unmercifully for allowing himself, a Masai, to be put\nto flight by a few bees. This the jolly fellow took very\ngood-humouredly, saying that if he only had a jacket like mine he would\nsoon go and get the honey. I gave him my jacket at once, and a most\ncomical figure he cut in it, as it was very short and he had\npractically nothing else on. When the nest was properly examined,\nhowever, it was found that the bees had eaten all the honey; so after\ntaking some photographs of our guides at work among the bees we all\nproceeded homewards, reaching camp about dusk, with nothing to show for\nour long day's hunt.\n\nWe were met by Sabaki, who was in a great state of excitement, and who\nstarted to explain in very bad Swahili how he had come across the dead\neland. Misunderstanding what he said, I told my friend that Sabaki had\nfound the eland which he had shot in the morning, and rejoiced heartily\nwith him at this piece of good luck. On viewing the head, however, we\ncould not understand it, as it was very much bigger than the one he had\nfired at; and it was not till later in the evening when I visited\nLandaalu, curled up at the camp fire, that the mystery was explained.\nHe greeted me by saying that after all we had not gone to Baringo for\nnothing the previous day, and on my asking him what he meant he told me\nabout the finding of the eland, taking, it for granted that I knew it\nwas mine. I quickly called up Sabaki and after some trouble got from\nhim the whole story of how he had found the body close to my little\nhillock and near where my men were searching for it. So I broke the\ntruth gently to my friend, who at once acknowledged my claim and\ncongratulated me on my good fortune.\n\nHow great this good fortune was I did not know till long after; but\neven then, when I came to examine the head and skin carefully, I found\nthat they both differed materially from those of any other eland that I\nhad ever seen. For one thing, there was no long tuft of hair on the\nforehead, while from the lower corner of each eye ran an incomplete\nwhite stripe similar to, though smaller than, those found in the giant\neland. The sides of the forehead were of a reddish colour, and on the\nlower part of the face there was a much larger brown patch than is to\nbe seen on the ordinary eland. The striping on the body was very\nslight, the chief markings being three lines across the withers. On my\nreturn to England in April. I sent the head to Rowland Ward's to be set\nup, and while there it was seen by Mr. R. Lydekker, F.R.S., of the\nBritish Museum, the well-known naturalist and specialist in big game,\nwho wrote to tell me that it possessed great zoological interest, as\nshowing the existence of a hitherto unknown race of eland. Mr. Lydekker\nalso contributed the following notice describing the animal to The\nField of September 29, 1906:\n\n\n\"Considerable interest attaches to the head of an eland, killed by\nColonel J.H. Patterson in Portuguese[1] East Africa, and set up by Mr.\nRowland Ward, on account of certain peculiarities in colouring and\nmarkings, which indicate a transition from the ordinary South African\nanimal in the direction of the giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus) of\nthe Bahr-el-Ghazal district and West Africa. In the striped variety\n(Taurotragus oryx livingstonianus) of the ordinary South African eland,\nthe whole middle line of the face of the adult bull is uniformly dark,\nor even blackish-brown, with a tuft of long bushy hair on the forehead,\nand no white stripe from the lower angle of the eye. On the other hand,\nin the Sudani form of the giant eland (T. derbianus gigas), as\nrepresented by a bull figured by Mr. Rothschild in Novitates Zoologicae\nfor 1905, the upper part of the face has the hair rufous and shorter\nthan in the ordinary eland, while from the lower angle of each eye a\nwhite stripe runs inwards and downwards, recalling the white chevron of\nthe kudu, although the two stripes do not meet in the middle line.\n\n\"In Colonel Patterson's eland (which may well be designated T. oryx\npattersonianus) there is an incomplete white chevron similar to,\nalthough rather smaller than, the one found in the giant eland, while\nonly a narrow stripe in the middle line of the face, above and between\nthe eyes, is dark-brown, the sides of the forehead being rufous. On the\nlower part of the face there is a larger dark-brown area than in the\nordinary eland, although there is a rufous fawn-coloured patch on each\nside above the nostril. In both the latter respects Colonel Patterson's\nspecimen recalls the giant eland, although it apparently lacks the dark\nwhite-bordered band on the side of the neck, characteristic of the\nlatter. If all the elands from that part of Portuguese East Africa\nwhere Colonel Patterson's specimen was obtained turn out to be of the\nsame type, there will be a strong presumption that the true and the\ngiant eland, like the various local forms of giraffe and bonte-quagga,\nare only races of one and the same species. While, even if the present\nspecimen be only a 'sport' (which I consider unlikely), it will serve\nto show that the southern and northern elands are more nearly related\nthan has hitherto been supposed.\"\n\n1 In error for \"British.\"\n\n\nAs my eland thus proved to be of some considerable scientific value,\nand as the authorities of the British Museum expressed a desire to\npossess its head, I gladly presented it to the Trustees, so that all\nsportsmen and naturalists might have an opportunity of seeing it at the\nNatural History Museum at South Kensington, where it now is.\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nI.\n\nSPORTSMEN who think of visiting British East Africa on a shooting trip\nmay be glad of a few general hints on points of interest and importance.\n\nThe battery, to be sufficient for all needs, should consist of a .450\nexpress, a .303 sporting rifle, and a 12-bore shot gun; and I should\nconsider 250 rounds of .450 (50 hard and 200 soft), 300 rounds of .303\n(100 hard and 200 soft), and 500 12-bore shot cartridges of say, the 6\nand 8 sizes, sufficient for a three months' trip. Leather bandoliers to\ncarry 50 each of these different cartridges would also prove very\nuseful.\n\nA couple of hundred rockets of various colours should certainly be\ntaken, as they are invaluable for signalling to and from camp after\ndark. These can be obtained so as to fire from a 12-bore shot gun or\nfrom a short pistol, and some should always be left with the camp\nneopara (Headman) for use as occasion requires.\n\nThe rifles, cartridges, and rockets should be consigned to an agent in\nMombasa, and sent off from London in tin-lined cases at least a month\nbefore the sportsman himself intends to start. It must be remembered\nthat the Customs House at Mombasa charges a 10 per cent duty on the\nvalue of all articles imported, so that the invoices should be\npreserved and produced for inspection.\n\nThe hunter's kit should include a good pith sunhat, a couple of suits\nof khaki, leather gaiters or a couple of pairs of puttees, wash-leather\ngloves to protect the hands from the sun, and two pairs of boots with\nhemp soles; long Norwegian boots will also be found very useful. The\nusual underclothing worn in England is all that is required if the\nshooting is to be done in the highlands. A good warm overcoat will be\nmuch appreciated up-country in the cool of the evenings, and a light\nmackintosh for wet weather ought also to be included. For use in rocky\nor thorny country, a pair of knee and elbow pads will be found\ninvaluable, and those who feel the sun should also provide themselves\nwith a spine-protector. The latter is a most useful article of kit, for\nalthough the air may be pretty cool, the sun strikes down very fiercely\ntowards midday. A well-filled medicine chest should of course not be\nforgotten.\n\nA good field glass, a hunting and skinning knife or two, and a Kodak\nwith about 200 films should also be carried. With regard to the last\nitem, I should strongly advise all who intend to take photographs on\ntheir trip to pay a visit to Mr. W.D. Young on arriving at Nairobi. He\nis an enthusiastic photographer, and will gladly give advice to all as\nto light and time of exposure; and as these are the two points which\nrequire most attention, hints from some one of experience in the\ncountry are most useful. I myself am much indebted to Mr. Young's\nkindly advice, and I am sure I should not have achieved much success in\nmy pictures without it. I made it a practice on my last visit to the\ncountry to send him the exposed films for development whenever I\nreached a postal station, and I should recommend others to do the same,\nas films deteriorate rapidly on the voyage home; indeed I had nearly\nfour hundred spoiled in this way, taken when I was in the country in\n1898-99.\n\nAs regards camp equipment, all that need be taken out from England are\na small double-fly tent, three Jaeger blankets, a collapsible bath, a\nWolseley valise, and a good filter; and even these can be obtained just\nas good locally. Chop boxes (food) and other necessary camp gear should\nbe obtained at Mombasa or Nairobi, where the agents will put up just\nwhat is necessary. About a month before sailing from England a letter\nshould be sent to the agents, stating the date of arrival and what\nporters, etc., will be required. The sportsman will then find\neverything ready for him, so that an immediate start may be made.\n\nUnless money is no object, I should not advise anyone to engage porters\nat Mombasa, as equally good men can be obtained at Nairobi, thus saving\n20 rupees per head in return railway fares. It must be remembered that\nfor transport work men are infinitely preferable to donkeys, as the\nlatter are exasperatingly slow and troublesome, especially on rough\nground or on crossing streams, where every load has to be unpacked,\ncarried over, and then reloaded on the animal's back. The caravan for\none sportsman--if he intends going far from the railway--is usually\nmade up as follows, though the exact numbers depend upon many\nconsiderations:\n\n\n  1 Headman ................ 50 rupees[1] per month.\n  1 Cook ................... 35    \"         \"\n  1 Gun-bearer ............. 20    \"         \"\n  1 \"Boy\" (personal servant) 20    \"         \"\n  2 Askaris (armed porters). 12    \"         \"      each.\n 30 Porters ................ 10    \"         \"      each.\n\n\n[1] The rupee in British East Africa is on the basis of 15 to the pound\nsterling.\n\nThe porters are all registered, the Government taking a small fee for\nthe registration; and according to custom half the wages due for the\nwhole trip are advanced to the men before a start is made. The\nsportsman is obliged to provide each porter with a jersey, blanket and\nwater-bottle, while the gun-bearer and \"boy\" get a pair of boots in\naddition. A cotton shelter-tent and a cooking pot must also be\nfurnished for every five men.\n\nThe food for the caravan is mostly rice, of which the Headman gets two\nkibabas (a kibaba is about 1-1\/2 lb.) per day; the cook, gun-bearer,\n\"boy\" and askaris one and a half kibabas, and the ordinary porters, one\nkibaba, each per day.\n\nIt is the duty of the Headman to keep discipline on the safari (caravan\njourney), both in camp and on the march, and to see to the distribution\nand safety of the loads, the pitching and striking of camp, the issue\nof posho (food) to the porters, etc. He always brings up the rear of\nthe caravan, and on him depends greatly the general comfort of the\nsportsman. For our trip at the beginning of 1906, we managed to secure\na splendid neapara, and never had the least trouble with the porters\nall the time. His only drawback was that he could not speak English,\nbut he told me when he left us that he was going to learn. Anybody\nsecuring him as Headman will be lucky; his name is Munyaki bin Dewani,\nand he can easily be found at Mombasa.\n\nThe cook is also an important member of the caravan, and a good one\nshould be procured if possible. It is wonderful what an experienced\nnative mpishi (cook) can turn out in the way of a meal in a few minutes\nafter camp is pitched.\n\nAs gun-bearer, most hunters prefer a Somali. I have never tried one,\nbut am told that they are inclined to be troublesome; they certainly\nrate themselves very highly, and demand about four times as much wages\nas an equally good Swahili.\n\nIn camp, the duties of the askaris are to keep up the fire and watch at\nnight, and to pitch and strike the Bwana's (Master's) tent. On the\nmarch one leads the caravan, the other brings up the rear; they give\nassistance in the event of any trouble with the loads, see that no\ndesertions take place, allow no straggling and generally do what they\ncan to protect the caravan. They are each armed with an old snider\nrifle and 10 rounds of ball cartridge, and are generally very dangerous\nmen to their friends when they take it into their heads to fire their\nweapons.\n\nThe ordinary porters will carry their 60-lb. loads day in and day out\nwithout complaint, so long as they are, well fed; but stint them of\ntheir rice, and they at once become sulky mutineers. In addition to\ncarrying the loads, they pitch and strike camp, procure firewood and\nwater, and build grass huts if a stay of more than a day is intended to\nbe made at one place. On the whole, the Swahili porter is one of the\njolliest and most willing fellows in the world, and I have nothing but\npraise for him.\n\nIt may be that our sportsman intends to confine his shooting trip to\nthe neighbourhood of the railway; in this case, the best plan is to\nhire one of the special carriages from the Traffic Manager of the\nUganda Railway. These carriages, which have good sleeping, cooking, and\nbath accommodation, can be attached to almost any train, and moved from\nstation to station or left standing in a siding at the directions of\nthe hunter. This is the cheapest and most comfortable way of spending a\nshort time in the country, as no tent, camp equipment, or regular\nporters are required; and some quite good sport can be obtained into\nthe bargain.\n\nAgain, if the hunter intends shooting, say, in the Kenya Province, as\nmany porters as he requires may be obtained from the official in charge\nat Fort Hall. The pay of the Kikuyu porter in such circumstances is\nonly two annas a day, while he provides his own food; neither is the\nsportsman asked to furnish him with a blanket, jersey, and water-bottle\nso long as he is not taken out of his own Province. Each Province is,\nin fact, governed as regards porters by its own special conditions,\nwhich can easily be ascertained on arrival in the country.\n\nThere are three lines of steamers which have direct sailings to Mombasa\nabout once a month. Two of these (the Union-Castle and the German East\nAfrican Lines) sail from Southampton, calling at Marseilles, while the\nthird (the Messageries-Maritimes) starts from the latter port. As a\nrule travellers to East Africa journey by the overland route to\nMarseilles and thence on by steamer to Mombasa--the whole journey from\nLondon averaging about eighteen days.\n\nThe present fares for the best accommodation from London to Mombasa by\nthe Union-Castle Line (including railway ticket to Marseilles) are as\nfollows First-Class Single, about 48 pounds; Return (available for one\nyear) about 93 pounds.\n\nThe fares by the German East African Line (including railway ticket to\nMarseilles) are:--First-Class; Single, about 48 pounds. The Return fare\n(available for one; year) is double the Single fare, less 10 per cent,\nof ocean part of journey.\n\nBy the Messageries-Maritimes Line the through First-Class Single fare\nfrom London to Mombasa (including railway ticket to Marseilles) is\nabout 48 pounds. The Return fare (available for two years) is about 72\npounds.\n\nFairly good hotel accommodation can be had at both Mombasa and Nairobi.\n\nBefore any shooting can be done it is necessary to take out a Game\nLicense, which may be obtained without difficulty at either of these\ntwo centres. This license (which costs 50 pounds) imposes an obligation\non the sportsman to make a return before he leaves the country of every\nanimal shot by him. By obtaining a special license two elephants, a\ngiraffe, greater kudu, buffalo and eland may be shot; but there are\nvarious stipulations and fees attaching to this license which alter\nfrom time to time.\n\nFairly good maps of the country may be obtained at Stanford's, Long\nAcre, W.C., while the Game Laws and Regulations can be procured from\nthe Colonial Office in Downing Street.\n\nPassenger trains leave Mombasa at 11 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays,\nFridays, and Saturdays, and are timed to arrive at Nairobi at 11:15\nnext morning and at Kisumu (the railway terminus on Lake Victoria\nNyanza) at 9 o'clock on the morning following. The First-Class Return\nfares from Mombasa to Nairobi, Kisumu, and Entebbe are 5 pounds 17s.\n9d., 10 pounds 10s. 3d., and 13 pounds 13s. 3d. respectively.\n\nIt is unnecessary to specify district by district when particular\nspecies of game are to be found, for the sportsman can easily learn\nthis for himself and get the latest news of game movements on his\narrival at Mombasa. As a matter of fact, the whole country abounds in\ngame, and there cannot be lack of sport and trophies for the keen\nshikari. The heads and skins should be very carefully sun-dried and\npacked in tin-lined cases with plenty of moth-killer for shipment home.\nFor mounting his trophies the sportsman cannot do better, I think, than\ngo to Rowland Ward of Piccadilly. I have had mine set up by this firm\nfor years past, and have always found their work excellent.\n\nI consider that 400 pounds should cover the entire cost of a three\nmonths' shooting trip to East Africa, including passage both ways. The\nfrugal sportsman will doubtless do it on less, while the extravagant\nman will probably spend very much more.\n\nShould time be available, a trip to the Victoria Nyanza should\ncertainly be made. The voyage round the Lake in one of the comfortable\nrailway steamers takes about eight days, but the crossing to Entebbe,\nthe official capital of Uganda, can be done in seventeen hours, though\nit usually takes twenty-seven, as at night the boats anchor for shelter\nunder the lee of an island. The steamer remains long enough in Entebbe\nharbour to enable the energetic traveller to pay a flying visit in a\nrickshaw to Kampala, the native capital, some twenty-one miles off. I\nspent a most interesting day last year in this way, and had a chat with\nthe boy King of Uganda, Daudi Chwa, at Mengo. He was then about nine\nyears old, and very bright and intelligent. He made no objection to my\ntaking his photograph, but it unfortunately turned out a failure.\n\nIt is curious to find the Baganda (i.e., people of Uganda) highly\ncivilised--the majority are Christians--surrounded as they are on all\nsides by nations of practically naked savages; and it is a very\ninteresting, sight to watch them in the \"bazaar\" at Kampala, clad in\nlong flowing cotton garments, and busily engaged in bartering the\nproducts of the country under the shade of tattered umbrellas.\nUnfortunately the great scourge of the district round the shores of the\nLake is the sleeping sickness, which in the past few years has carried\noff thousands of the natives, and has quite depopulated the islands,\nwhich were once densely inhabited. The disease is communicated by the\nbite of an infected fly, but happily this pest is only found in certain\nwell-defined regions, so that if the traveller avoids these he is quite\nas safe, as regards sleeping sickness, as if he had remained in England.\n\nOn the return journey from Entebbe, Jinja, a port on the north side of\nthe Victoria Nyanza, is usually called at. This place is of great\ninterest, as it is here that the Lake narrows into a breadth of only a\nfew hundred yards, and, rushing over the Ripon Falls, forms the\nlong-sought-for source of the Nile. The magnificent view of the mighty\nriver stretching away to the north amid enchanting scenery is most\ninspiring and one can well imagine how elated Speke must have felt when\nafter enduring countless hardships, he at last looked upon it and thus\nsolved one of the great problems the ancients.\n\nII.\n\nThe following, is a literal translation of the Hindustani poem referred\nto on p. 104:--\n\nIN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE:\n\nFirst must I speak to the praise and glory of God, who is infinite and\nincomprehensible,\n\nWho is without fault or error, who is the Life, though without body or\nbreath.\n\nHe has no relatives, nor father nor son, being himself incomparable and\npassionless.\n\nHis is the knowledge of the known and of the unknown, and although\nwithout a tongue, yet does he speak in mighty tones.\n\nI, Roshan, came to this country of Africa, and did find it indeed a\nstrange land;\n\nMany rocks, mountains, and dense forests abounding in lions and\nleopards;\n\nAlso buffaloes, wolves, deer, rhinoceroses, elephants, camels, and all\nenemies of man;\n\nGorillas, ferocious monkeys that attack men, black baboons of giant\nsize, spirits, and thousands of varieties of birds;\n\nWild horses, wild dogs, black snakes, and all animals that a hunter or\nsportsman could desire.\n\nThe forests are so dark and dreadful that even the boldest warriors\nshrink from their awful depths.\n\nNow from the town of Mombasa, a railway line extends unto Uganda;\n\nIn the forests bordering on this line, there are found those lions\ncalled \"man-eaters,\" and moreover these forests are full of thorns and\nprickly shrubs.\n\nPortions of this railway from Mombasa to Uganda are still being made,\nand here these lions fell on the workmen and destroyed them.\n\nSuch was their habit, day and night, and hundreds of men fell victims\nto these savage creatures, whose very jaws were steeped in blood.\n\nBones, flesh, skin and blood, they devoured all, and left not a trace\nbehind them.\n\nBecause of the fear of these demons some seven or eight hundred of the\nlabourers deserted, and remained idle;\n\nSome two or three hundred still remained, but they were haunted by this\nterrible dread,\n\nAnd because of fear for their lives, would sit in their huts, their\nhearts full of foreboding and terror.\n\nEvery one of them kept a fire burning at night, and none dared to close\nhis eyes in sleep; yet would some of them be carried away to\ndestruction.\n\nThe lion's roar was such that the very earth would tremble at the\nsound, and where was the man who did not feel afraid?\n\nOn all sides arose weeping and wailing, and the people would sit and\ncry like cranes, complaining of the deeds of the lions.\n\nI, Roshan, chief of my people, also complained and prayed to God, the\nProphet, and to our spiritual adviser.\n\nAnd now will I relate the story of the Engineer in charge of the line.\n\nHe kept some ten or twenty goats, for the sake of their milk;\n\nBut one night a wild beast came, and destroyed them all, not one being\nleft.\n\nAnd in the morning it was reported by the watchman, who also stated\nthat the man-eater was daily destroying the labourers and workmen, and\ndoing great injury;\n\nAnd they took the Engineer with them and showed him the footprints of\nthe animal.\n\nAnd after seeing what the animal had done, the Englishman spoke, and\nsaid,\n\n\"For this damage the lion shall pay his life.\" And when night came he\ntook his gun and in very truth destroyed the beast.\n\nPatterson Sahib is indeed a brave and valiant man, like unto those\nPersian heroes of old--Rustem, Zal, Sohrab and Berzoor;\n\nSo brave is he, that the greatest warriors stood aghast at his action;\n\nTall in stature, young, most brave and of great strength is he.\n\nFrom the other side of the line came the noise and cries of those who\ncomplained that these savage beasts were eating and destroying men,\n\nFor such has been the habit of lions from time immemorial, and groups\nof people have fallen victims to their fury.\n\nThose who were proud or boastful, have but sacrificed their lives\nuselessly;\n\nBut to-day Patterson Sahib will watch for the lion himself!\n\nFor the people have complained loudly, and the valiant one has gone\nforth with his gun into the forest.\n\nSoon after the people had retired at night to their tents, the fearless\nlion made his appearance;\n\nPatterson Sahib loaded both barrels of his gun and went forth against\nhim.\n\nHe fired many times in succession and totally paralysed the animal.\n\nThe lion roared like thunder as the bullets found their way to his\nheart.\n\nThis Englishman, Patterson, is most brave, and is indeed the very\nessence of valour;\n\nLions do not fear lions, yet one glance from Patterson Sahib cowed the\nbravest of them.\n\nHe fled, making for the forest, while the bullets followed hard after\nhim;\n\nSo was this man-eater rendered helpless; he lay down in despair,\n\nAnd after he had covered a chain's distance, the savage beast fell\ndown, a corpse.\n\nNow the people, bearing lights in their hands, all ran to look at their\ndead enemy.\n\nBut the Sahib said \"Return, my children; the night is dark, do not rush\ninto danger.\"\n\nAnd in the morning all the people saw the lion lying dead.\n\nAnd then the Sahib said, \"Do not think of work to-day--make holiday,\nenjoy and be merry.\"\n\nSo the people had holiday and made merry with friends from whom they\nhad been long parted, on account of the lion:\n\nAnd the absence of those who had run away was forgiven, and their money\nallowed them--A generous action, comparable to the forgiveness of God\nand the Prophet to sinners and criminals on the day of judgment.\n\nOh! poet, leave this kind of simile, it is too deep for thee;\n\nWe mortals have the Devil, like unto a fierce lion, ever after us;\n\nOh! Roshan, may God, the Prophet, and your spiritual adviser, safeguard\nyou day and night!\n\nOne lion, however, remained, and for fear of him all went in dread;\n\nSixteen days passed, all being well, and everyone enjoyed a peaceful\nmind;\n\nBut again, on the seventeenth day, the lion appeared and remained from\nsunset to sunrise.\n\nHe kept on roaming about in the neighbourhood like a general\nreconnoitring the enemy's position.\n\nOn the following day the Sahib sent for the people and warned them all\nto be careful of their lives;\n\n\"Do not go out from the afternoon even until the following morning,\" he\nsaid.\n\nNow this was the night of Shab-i-Kadr, a Muslim festival:\n\nAnd at night when all had retired to rest, the lion came in a rage,\n\nAnd Patterson Sahib went forth into the field to meet him.\n\nAnd when he saw the beast, he fired quickly, bullet after bullet.\n\nThe lion made a great uproar, and fled for his life, but the bullets\nnevertheless found a resting-place in his heart.\n\nAnd everyone began to shriek and groan in their uneasy sleep, jumping\nup in fear, when unexpectedly the roaring of the lion was heard.\n\nAll thought of sleep was banished, and fear came in its place:\n\nAnd the Sahib gave emphatic orders that no one should go out, or roam\nabout.\n\nAnd in the morning we followed the marks of blood that had flowed from\nthe wounded animal,\n\nAnd some five or seven chains away, we found the lion, lying wounded\nand in great pain.\n\nAnd when the Sahib saw the animal he fired bullets incessantly;\n\nBut when the lion saw the Sahib, the savage animal, burning with rage,\nand pain,\n\nCame by leaps and bounds close to the Sahib; But here he was to meet\nhis match in a brave Sahib who loaded his gun calmly, and fired again\nand again, killing the beast.\n\nAll the Punjaubis assembled together and agreed that the Sahib was a\nman who appreciated and cared for others, so much so that he roamed\nabout in the forests for our sake, in order to protect us.\n\nPreviously, many Englishmen had come here to shoot but had been\ndisappointed,\n\nBecause the lion was very courageous and ferocious, and the Sahibs were\nafraid;\n\nBut for the sake of our lives, Patterson Sahib took all this trouble,\nrisking his own life in the forest.\n\nSo they collected many hundreds of rupees, and offered it as a present\nto the Sahib, because he had undergone such peril, in order to save our\nlives.\n\nOh! Roshan, all the people appeared before the Sahib saying, \"You are\nour benefactor\";\n\nBut the Sahib declined to accept the present, not taking a pice of it.\n\nSo then again the Punjaubis assembled, and consulted as to how the\nservice that the Sahib had done them could most suitably he rewarded.\n\nAnd it was agreed to send all the money to England, in order that it\nmight be converted into some suitable present,\n\nWhich should bear an engraving of the two lions, and the name of the\nmistari[1], head of the workmen.\n\nThe present should be such, and so suitably decorated, as to be\nacceptable to Patterson Sahib;\n\nIn colour it should resemble moon and sun; and that would indeed be a\nfit present, so that the Sahib would be pleased to accept it.\n\nOh! Roshan, I hope that he will accept this present for shooting the\nlions, as some small reward for his action.\n\nMy native home is at Chajanlat, in the thana of Domli, which is in the\ndistrict of Jhelum, and I have related this story as it actually\noccurred.\n\nPatterson Sahib has left me, and I shall miss him as long as I live,\nand now\n\nRoshan must roam about in Africa, sad and regretful.\n\n[1] Foreman-mason.\n\nComposed by Roshan mistari, son of Kadur mistari Bakhsh, native of the\nvillage of Chajanlat, Dakhli, Post Office Domli, district of Jhelum.\nDated 29th January, 1899.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Man-eaters of Tsavo and Other East\nAfrican Adventures, by J.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":857,"split":"train"}
