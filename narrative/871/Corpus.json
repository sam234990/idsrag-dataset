{"ori_id":"cacab4b8f8c2fd2db7dab52793e34a398b98fe07","title":"Home of the Gentry","context":"Home of the Gentry\n The novel's protagonist is Fyodor Ivanych Lavretsky, a nobleman who shares many traits with Turgenev. The child of a distant, Anglophile father and a serf mother who dies when he is very young, Lavretsky is brought up at his family's country estate home by a severe maiden aunt, often thought to be based on Turgenev's own mother who was known for her cruelty.\nLavretsky pursues an education in Moscow, and while he is studying there, he spies a beautiful young woman at the opera. Her name is Varvara Pavlovna, and he falls in love with her and asks for her hand in marriage. Following their wedding, the two move to Paris, where Varvara Pavlovna becomes a very popular salon hostess and begins an affair with one of her frequent visitors. Lavretsky learns of the affair only when he discovers a note written to her by her lover. Shocked by her betrayal, he severs all contact with her and returns to his family estate.\nUpon returning to Russia, Lavretsky visits his cousin, Marya Dmitrievna Kalitina, who lives with her two daughters, Liza and Lenochka. Lavretsky is immediately drawn to Liza, whose serious nature and religious devotion stand in contrast to the coquettish Varvara Pavlovna's social consciousness. Lavretsky realizes that he is falling in love with Liza, and when he reads in a foreign journal that Varvara Pavlovna has died, he confesses his love to her and learns that she loves him in return.\nUnfortunately, a cruel twist of fate prevents Lavretsky and Liza from being together. After they confess their love to one another, Lavretsky returns home to find his supposedly dead wife waiting for him in his foyer. It turns out that the reports of her death were false, and that she has fallen out of favor with her friends and needs more money from Lavretsky.\nUpon learning of Varvara Pavlovna's sudden appearance, Liza decides to join a remote convent and lives out the rest of her days as a nun. Lavretsky visits her at the convent one time and catches a glimpse of her as she is walking from choir to choir. The novel ends with an epilogue which takes place eight years later, in which Lavretsky returns to Liza's house and finds that, although many things have changed, there are elements such as the piano and the garden that are the same. Lavretsky finds comfort in his memories and is able to see the meaning and even the beauty in his personal pain.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A House of Gentlefolk, by Ivan Turgenev\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

High overhead in the clear\nheavens small rosy clouds seemed hardly to move across the sky but to be\nsinking into its depths of blue.\n\nIn a handsome house in one of the outlying streets of the government\ntown of O---- (it was in the year 1842) two women were sitting at an\nopen window; one was about fifty, the other an old lady of seventy.\n\nThe name of the former was Marya Dmitrievna Kalitin. Her husband, a\nshrewd determined man of obstinate bilious temperament, had been dead\nfor ten years. He had been a provincial public prosecutor, noted in\nhis own day as a successful man of business. He had received a fair\neducation and had been to the university; but having been born in narrow\ncircumstances he realized early in life the necessity of pushing his\nown way in the world and making money. It had been a love-match on Marya\nDmitrievna's side. He was not bad-looking, was clever and could be very\nagreeable when he chose. Marya Dmitrievna Pesto--that was her maiden\nname--had lost her parents in childhood. She spent some years in a\nboarding-school in Moscow, and after leaving school, lived on the family\nestate of Pokrovskoe, about forty miles from O----, with her aunt\nand her elder brother. This brother soon after obtained a post in\nPetersburg, and made them a scanty allowance. He treated his aunt and\nsister very shabbily till his sudden death cut short his career. Marya\nDmitrievna inherited Pokrovskoe, but she did not live there long. Two\nyears after her marriage with Kalitin, who succeeded in winning her\nheart in a few days, Pokrovskoe was exchanged for another estate, which\nyielded a much larger income, but was utterly unattractive and had no\nhouse. At the same time Kalitin took a house in the town of O----, in\nwhich he and his wife took up their permanent abode. There was a large\ngarden round the house, which on one side looked out upon the open\ncountry away from the town.\n\n\"And so,\" decided Kalitin, who had a great distaste for the quiet of\ncountry life, \"there would be no need for them to be dragging themselves\noff into the country.\" In her heart Marya Dmitrievna more than once\nregretted her pretty Pokrovskoe, with its babbling brook, its wide\nmeadows, and green copses; but she never opposed her husband in anything\nand had the greatest veneration for his wisdom and knowledge of the\nworld. When after fifteen years of married life he died leaving her with\na son and two daughters, Marya Dmitrievna had grown so accustomed to her\nhouse and to town life that she had no inclination to leave O----.\n\nIn her youth Marya Dmitrievna had always been spoken of as a pretty\nblonde; and at fifty her features had not lost all charm, though\nthey were somewhat coarser and less delicate in outline. She was more\nsentimental than kindhearted; and even at her mature age, she retained\nthe manners of the boarding-school. She was self-indulgent and easily\nput out, even moved to tears when she was crossed in any of her habits.\nShe was, however, very sweet and agreeable when all her wishes were\ncarried out and none opposed her. Her house was among the pleasantest\nin the town. She had a considerable fortune, not so much from her own\nproperty as from her husband's savings. Her two daughters were living\nwith her; her son was being educated in one of the best government\nschools in Petersburg.\n\nThe old lady sitting with Marya Dmitrievna at the window was her\nfather's sister, the same aunt with whom she had once spent some\nsolitary years in Pokrovskoe. Her name was Marfa Timofyevna Pestov. She\nhad a reputation for eccentricity as she was a woman of an independent\ncharacter, told every one the truth to his face, and even in the most\nstraitened circumstances behaved just as if she had a fortune at her\ndisposal. She could not endure Kalitin, and directly her niece married\nhim, she removed to her little property, where for ten whole years she\nlived in a smoky peasants' hut. Marya Dmitrievna was a little afraid of\nher. A little sharp-nosed woman with black hair and keen eyes even in\nher old age, Marfa Timofyevna walked briskly, held herself upright and\nspoke quickly and clearly in a sharp ringing voice. She always wore a\nwhite cap and a white dressing-jacket.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" she asked Marya Dmitrievna suddenly. \"What\nare you sighing about, pray?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the latter. \"What exquisite clouds!\"\n\n\"You feel sorry for them, eh?\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna made no reply.\n\n\"Why is it Gedeonovsky does not come?\" observed Marfa Timofyevna, moving\nher knitting needles quickly. (She was knitting a large woolen scarf.)\n\"He would have sighed with you--or at least he'd have had some fib to\ntell you.\"\n\n\"How hard you always are on him! Sergei Petrovitch is a worthy man.\"\n\n\"Worthy!\" repeated the old lady scornfully.\n\n\"And how devoted he was to my poor husband!\" observed Marya Dmitrievna;\n\"even now he cannot speak of him without emotion.\"\n\n\"And no wonder! It was he who picked him out of the gutter,\" muttered\nMarfa Timofyevna, and her knitting needles moved faster than ever.\n\n\"He looks so meek and mild,\" she began again, \"with his grey head, but\nhe no sooner opens his mouth than out comes a lie or a slander. And to\nthink of his having the rank of a councillor! To be sure, though, he's\nonly a village priest's son.\"\n\n\"Every one has faults, auntie; that is his weak point, no doubt. Sergei\nPetrovitch has had no education: of course he does not speak French,\nstill, say what you like, he is an agreeable man.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is always ready to kiss your hands. He does not speak\nFrench--that's no great loss. I am not over strong in the French lingo\nmyself. It would be better if he could not speak at all; he would\nnot tell lies then. But here he is--speak of the devil,\" added Marfa\nTimofyevna looking into the street. \"Here comes your agreeable man\nstriding along. What a lanky creature he is, just like a stork!\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna began to arrange her curls. Marfa Timofyevna looked at\nher ironically.\n\n\"What's that, not a grey hair surely? You must speak to your Palashka,\nwhat can she be thinking about?\"\n\n\"Really, auntie, you are always so...\" muttered Marya Dmitrievna in a\ntone of vexation, drumming on the arm of her chair with her finger-tips.\n\n\"Sergei Petrovitch Gedeonovsky!\" was announced in a shrill piping voice,\nby a rosy-cheeked little page who made his appearance at the door.\n\n\n\nChapter II\n\n\nA tall man entered, wearing a tidy overcoat, rather short trousers, grey\ndoeskin gloves, and two neckties--a black one outside, and a white one\nbelow it. There was an air of decorum and propriety in everything about\nhim, from his prosperous countenance and smoothly brushed hair, to his\nlow-heeled, noiseless boots. He bowed first to the lady of the house,\nthen to Marfa Timofyevna, and slowly drawing off his gloves, he advanced\nto take Marya Dmitrievna's hand. After kissing it respectfully twice he\nseated himself with deliberation in an arm-chair, and rubbing the very\ntips of his fingers together, he observed with a smile--\n\n\"And is Elisaveta Mihalovna quite well?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna, \"she's in the garden.\"\n\n\"And Elena Mihalovna?\"\n\n\"Lenotchka's in the garden too. Is there no news?\"\n\n\"There is indeed!\" replied the visitor, slowly blinking his eyes and\npursing up his mouth. \"Hm!... yes, indeed, there is a piece of news, and\nvery surprising news too. Lavretsky--Fedor Ivanitch is here.\"\n\n\"Fedya!\" cried Marfa Timofyevna. \"Are you sure you are not romancing, my\ngood man?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I saw him myself.\"\n\n\"Well, that does not prove it.\"\n\n\"Fedor Ivanitch looked much more robust,\" continued Gedeonovsky,\naffecting not to have heard Marfa Timofyevna's last remark. \"Fedor\nIvanitch is broader and has quite a colour.\"\n\n\"He looked more robust,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, dwelling on each\nsyllable. \"I should have thought he had little enough to make him look\nrobust.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" observed Gedeonovsky; \"any other man in Fedor Ivanitch's\nposition would have hesitated to appear in society.\"\n\n\"Why so, pray?\" interposed Marfa Timofyevna. \"What nonsense are you\ntalking! The man's come back to his home--where would you have him go?\nAnd has he been to blame, I should like to know!\"\n\n\"The husband is always to blame, madam, I venture to assure you, when a\nwife misconducts herself.\"\n\n\"You say that, my good sir, because you have never been married\nyourself.\" Gedeonovsky listened with a forced smile.\n\n\"If I may be so inquisitive,\" he asked, after a short pause, \"for whom\nis that pretty scarf intended?\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna gave him a sharp look.\n\n\"It's intended,\" she replied, \"for a man who does not talk scandal, nor\nplay the hypocrite, nor tell lies, if there's such a man to be found in\nthe world. I know Fedya well; he was only to blame in being too good\nto his wife. To be sure, he married for love, and no good ever comes of\nthose love-matches,\" added the old lady, with a sidelong glance at Marya\nDmitrievna, as she got up from her place. \"And now, my good sir, you may\nattack any one you like, even me if you choose; I'm going. I will not\nhinder you.\" And Marfa Timofyevna walked away.\n\n\"That's always how she is,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, following her aunt\nwith her eyes.\n\n\"We must remember your aunt's age...there's no help for it,\" replied\nGedeonovsky. \"She spoke of a man not playing the hypocrite. But who is\nnot hypocritical nowadays? It's the age we live in. One of my friends,\na most worthy man, and, I assure you, a man of no mean position, used to\nsay, that nowadays the very hens can't pick up a grain of corn without\nhypocrisy--they always approach it from one side. But when I look at\nyou, dear lady--your character is so truly angelic; let me kiss your\nlittle snow-white hand!\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna with a faint smile held out her plump hand to him with\nthe little finger held apart from the rest. He pressed his lips to it,\nand she drew her chair nearer to him, and bending a little towards him,\nasked in an undertone--\n\n\"So you saw him? Was he really--all right--quite well and cheerful?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was well and cheerful,\" replied Gedeonovsky in a whisper.\n\n\"You haven't heard where his wife is now?\"\n\n\"She was lately in Paris; now, they say, she has gone away to Italy.\"\n\n\"It is terrible, indeed--Fedya's position; I wonder how he can bear it.\nEvery one, of course, has trouble; but he, one may say, has been made\nthe talk of all Europe.\"\n\nGedeonovsky sighed.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, yes, indeed. They do say, you know that she associates\nwith artists and musicians, and as the saying is, with strange creatures\nof all kinds. She has lost all sense of shame completely.\"\n\n\"I am deeply, deeply grieved.\" said Marya Dmitrievna. \"On account of\nour relationship. You know, Sergei Petrovitch, he's my cousin many times\nremoved.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. Don't I know everything that concerns your\nfamily? I should hope so, indeed.\"\n\n\"Will he come to see us--what do you think?\"\n\n\"One would suppose so; though, they say, he is intending to go home to\nhis country place.\"\n\nMary Dmitrievna lifted her eyes to heaven.\n\n\"Ah, Sergei Petrovitch, Sergei Petrovitch, when I think how careful we\nwomen ought to be in our conduct!\"\n\n\"There are women and women, Marya Dmitrievna. There are unhappily such\n... of flighty character... and at a certain age too, and then they\nare not brought up in good principles.\" (Sergei Petrovitch drew a blue\nchecked handkerchief out of his pocket and began to unfold it.) \"There\nare such women, no doubt.\" (Sergei Petrovitch applied a corner of the\nhandkerchief first to one and then to the other eye.) \"But speaking\ngenerally, if one takes into consideration, I mean...the dust in the\ntown is really extraordinary to-day,\" he wound up.\n\n\"Maman, maman,\" cried a pretty little girl of eleven running into the\nroom, \"Vladimir Nikolaitch is coming on horseback!\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna got up; Sergei Petrovitch also rose and made a bow.\n\"Our humble respects to Elena Mihalovna,\" he said, and turning aside\ninto a corner for good manners, he began blowing his long straight nose.\n\n\"What a splendid horse he has!\" continued the little girl. \"He was at\nthe gate just now, he told Lisa and me he would dismount at the steps.\"\n\nThe sound of hoofs was heard; and a graceful young man, riding a\nbeautiful bay horse, was seen in the street, and stopped at the open\nwindow.\n\n\n\nChapter III\n\n\n\"How do you do, Marya Dmitrievna?\" cried the young man in a pleasant,\nringing voice. \"How do you like my new purchase?\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna went up to the window.\n\n\"How do you do, Woldemar! Ah, what a splendid horse! Where did you buy\nit?\"\n\n\"I bought it from the army contractor.... He made me pay for it too, the\nbrigand!\"\n\n\"What's its name?\"\n\n\"Orlando.... But it's a stupid name; I want to change.... Eh bien, eh\nbien, mon garcon.... What a restless beast it is!\" The horse snorted,\npawed the ground, and shook the foam off the bit.\n\n\"Lenotchka, stroke him, don't be afraid.\"\n\nThe little girl stretched her hand out of the window, but Orlando\nsuddenly reared and started. The rider with perfect self-possession gave\nit a cut with the whip across the neck, and keeping a tight grip with\nhis legs forced it in spite of its opposition, to stand still again at\nthe window.\n\n\"Prenez garde, prenez garde,\" Marya Dmitrievna kept repeating.\n\n\"Lenotchka, pat him,\" said the young man, \"I won't let him be perverse.\"\n\nThe little girl again stretched out her hand and timidly patted the\nquivering nostrils of the horse, who kept fidgeting and champing the\nbit.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried Marya Dmitrievna, \"but now get off and come in to us.\"\n\nThe rider adroitly turned his horse, gave him a touch of the spur, and\ngalloping down the street soon reached the courtyard. A minute later\nhe ran into the drawing-room by the door from the hall, flourishing his\nwhip; at the same moment there appeared in the other doorway a tall,\nslender dark-haired girl of nineteen, Marya Dmitrievna's eldest\ndaughter, Lisa.\n\n\n\nChapter IV\n\n\nThe name of the young man whom we have just introduced to the reader\nwas Vladimir Nikolaitch Panshin. He served in Petersburg on special\ncommissions in the department of internal affairs. He had come to the\ntown of O---- to carry out some temporary government commissions,\nand was in attendance on the Governor-General Zonnenberg, to whom he\nhappened to be distantly related. Panshin's father, a retired cavalry\nofficer and a notorious gambler, was a man with insinuating eyes, a\nbattered countenance, and a nervous twitch about the mouth. He spent his\nwhole life hanging about the aristocratic world; frequented the English\nclubs of both capitals, and had the reputation of a smart, not very\ntrustworthy, but jolly good-natured fellow. In spite of his smartness,\nhe was almost always on the brink of ruin, and the property he left his\nson was small and heavily-encumbered. To make up for that, however,\nhe did exert himself, after his own fashion, over his son's education.\nVladimir Nikolaitch spoke French very well, English well, and German\nbadly; that is the proper thing; fashionable people would be ashamed\nto speak German well; but to utter an occasional--generally a\nhumorous--phrase in German is quite correct, c'est meme tres chic,\nas the Parisians of Petersburg express themselves. By the time he\nwas fifteen, Vladimir knew how to enter any drawing-room without\nembarrassment, how to move about in it gracefully and to leave it at\nthe appropriate moment. Panshin's father gained many connections for his\nson. He never lost an opportunity, while shuffling the cards between\ntwo rubbers, or playing a successful trump, of dropping a hint about his\nVolodka to any personage of importance who was a devotee of cards. And\nVladimir, too, during his residence at the university, which he left\nwithout a very brilliant degree, formed an acquaintance with several\nyoung men of quality, and gained an entry into the best houses. He was\nreceived cordially everywhere: he was very good-looking, easy in his\nmanners, amusing, always in good health, and ready for everything;\nrespectful, when he ought to be; insolent, when he dared to be;\nexcellent company, un charmant garcon. The promised land lay before him.\nPanshin quickly learnt the secret of getting on in the world; he knew\nhow to yield with genuine respect to its decrees; he knew how to take\nup trifles with half ironical seriousness, and to appear to regard\neverything serious as trifling; he was a capital dancer; and dressed in\nthe English style. In a short time he gained the reputation of being one\nof the smartest and most attractive young men in Petersburg.\n\nPanshin was indeed very smart, not less so than his father; but he was\nalso very talented. He did everything well; he sang charmingly, sketched\nwith spirit, wrote verses, and was a very fair actor. He was only\ntwenty-eight, and he was already a kammer-yunker, and had a very\ngood position. Panshin had complete confidence in himself, in his\nown intelligence, and his own penetration; he made his way with\nlight-hearted assurance, everything went smoothly with him. He was\nused to being liked by every one, old and young, and imagined that\nhe understood people, especially women: he certainly understood their\nordinary weaknesses. As a man of artistic leanings, he was conscious of\na capacity for passion, for being carried away, even for enthusiasm,\nand consequently, he permitted himself various irregularities; he was\ndissipated, associated with persons not belonging to good society, and,\nin general, conducted himself in a free and easy manner; but at heart he\nwas cold and false, and at the moment of the most boisterous revelry\nhis sharp brown eye was always alert, taking everything in. This bold,\nindependent young man could never forget himself and be completely\ncarried away. To his credit it must be said, that he never boasted\nof his conquests. He had found his way into Marya Dmitrievna's house\nimmediately he arrived in O----, and was soon perfectly at home there.\nMarya Dmitrievna absolutely adored him. Panshin exchanged cordial\ngreetings with every one in the room; he shook hands with Marya\nDmitrievna and Lisaveta Mihalovna, clapped Gedeonovsky lightly on the\nshoulder, and turning round on his heels, put his hand on Lenotchka's\nhead and kissed her on the forehead.\n\n\"Aren't you afraid to ride such a vicious horse?\" Marya Dmitrievna\nquestioned him.\n\n\"I assure you he's very quiet, but I will tell you what I am afraid\nof: I'm afraid to play preference with Sergei Petrovitch; yesterday he\ncleaned me out of everything at Madame Byelenitsin's.\"\n\nGedeonovsky gave a thin, sympathetic little laugh; he was anxious to\nbe in favour with the brilliant young official from Petersburg--the\ngovernor's favourite. In conversation with Marya Dmitrievna, he often\nalluded to Panshin's remarkable abilities. Indeed, he used to argue,\nhow can one help admiring him? The young man is making his way in the\nhighest spheres, he is an exemplary official, and not a bit of pride\nabout him. And, in fact, even in Petersburg Panshin was reckoned a\ncapable official; he got through a great deal of work; he spoke of it\nlightly as befits a man of the world who does not attach any special\nimportance to his labours, but he never hesitated in carrying out\norders. The authorities like such subordinates; he himself had no doubt,\nthat if he chose, he could be a minister in time.\n\n\"You are pleased to say that I cleaned you out,\" replied Gedeonovsky;\n\"but who was it won twelve roubles of me last week and more?\"...\n\n\"You're a malicious fellow,\" Panshin interrupted, with genial but\nsomewhat contemptuous carelessness, and, paying him no further\nattention, he went up to Lisa.\n\n\"I cannot get the overture of Oberon here,\" he began. \"Madame\nByelenitsin was boasting when she said she had all the classical music:\nin reality she has nothing but polkas and waltzes, but I have already\nwritten to Moscow, and within a week you will have the overture. By the\nway,\" he went on, \"I wrote a new song yesterday, the words too are mine,\nwould you care for me to sing it? I don't know how far it is successful.\nMadame Byelenitsin thought it very pretty, but her words mean nothing. I\nshould like to know what you think of it. But, I think, though, that had\nbetter be later on.\"\n\n\"Why later on?\" interposed Marya Dmitrievna, \"why not now?\"\n\n\"I obey,\" replied Panshin, with a peculiar bright and sweet smile, which\ncame and went suddenly on his face. He drew up a chair with his\nknee, sat down to the piano, and striking a few chords began to sing,\narticulating the words clearly, the following song--\n\n        Above the earth the moon floats high\n            Amid pale clouds;\n        Its magic light in that far sky\n            Yet stirs the floods.\n\n        My heart has found a moon to rule\n            Its stormy sea;\n        To joy and sorrow it is moved\n            Only by thee.\n\n        My soul is full of love's cruel smart,\n            And longing vain;\n        But thou art calm, as that cold moon,\n            That knows not pain.\n\nThe second couplet was sung by Panshin with special power and\nexpression, the sound of waves was heard in the stormy accompaniment.\nAfter the words \"and longing vain,\" he sighed softly, dropped his eyes\nand let his voice gradually die away, morendo. When he had finished,\nLisa praised the motive, Marya Dmitrievna cried, \"Charming!\" but\nGedeonovsky went so far as to exclaim, \"Ravishing poetry, and music\nequally ravishing!\" Lenotchka looked with childish reverence at the\nsinger. In short, every one present was delighted with the young\ndilettante's composition; but at the door leading into the drawing-room\nfrom the hall stood an old man, who had only just come in, and who,\nto judge by the expression of his downcast face and the shrug of his\nshoulders, was by no means pleased with Panshin's song, pretty though it\nwas. After waiting a moment and flicking the dust off his boots with\na coarse pocket-handkerchief, this man suddenly raised his eyes,\ncompressed his lips with a morose expression, and his stooping figure\nbent forward, he entered the drawing-room.\n\n\"Ah! Christopher Fedoritch, how are you?\" exclaimed Panshin before any\nof the others could speak, and he jumped up quickly from his seat. \"I\nhad no suspicion that you were here--nothing would have induced me to\nsing my song before you. I know you are no lover of light music.\"\n\n\"I did not hear it,\" declared the new-comer, in very bad Russian, and\nexchanging greetings with every one, he stood awkwardly in the middle of\nthe room.\n\n\"Have you come, Monsieur Lemm,\" said Marya Dmitrievna, \"to give Lisa her\nmusic lesson?\"\n\n\"No, not Lisaveta Mihalovna, but Elena Mihalovna.\"\n\n\"Oh! very well. Lenotchka, go up-stairs with Mr. Lemm.\"\n\nThe old man was about to follow the little girl, but Panshin stopped\nhim.\n\n\"Don't go after the lesson, Christopher Fedoritch,\" he said. \"Lisa\nMihalovna and I are going to play a duet of Beethoven's sonata.\"\n\nThe old man muttered some reply, and Panshin continued in German,\nmispronouncing the words--\n\n\"Lisaveta Mihalovna showed me the religious cantata you dedicated to\nher--a beautiful thing! Pray, do not suppose that I cannot appreciate\nserious music--quite the contrary: it is tedious sometimes, but then it\nis very elevating.\"\n\nThe old man crimsoned to his ears, and with a sidelong look at Lisa, he\nhurriedly went out of the room.\n\nMarya Dmitrievna asked Panshin to sing his song again; but he protested\nthat he did not wish to torture the ears of the musical German, and\nsuggested to Lisa that they should attack Beethoven's sonata. Then Marya\nDmitrievna heaved a sigh, and in her turn suggested to Gedeonovsky a\nwalk in the garden. \"I should like,\" she said, \"to have a little more\ntalk, and to consult you about our poor Fedya.\" Gedeonovsky bowed with a\nsmirk, and with two fingers picked up his hat, on the brim of which\nhis gloves had been tidily laid, and went away with Marya Dmitrievna.\nPanshin and Lisa remained alone in the room; she fetched the sonata, and\nopened it; both seated themselves at the piano in silence. Overhead were\nheard the faint sounds of scales, played by the uncertain fingers of\nLenotchka.\n\n\n\nChapter V\n\n\nChristopher Theodor Gottlieb Lemm was born in 1786 in the town of\nChemnitz in Saxony. His parents were poor musicians. His father played\nthe French horn, his mother the harp; he himself was practising on three\ndifferent instruments by the time he was five. At eight years old he was\nleft an orphan, and from his tenth year he began to earn his bread\nby his art. He led a wandering life for many years, and performed\neverywhere in restaurants, at fairs, at peasants' weddings, and at\nballs. At last he got into an orchestra and constantly rising in it, he\nobtained the position of director. He was rather a poor performer; but\nhe understood music thoroughly. At twenty-eight he migrated into Russia,\non the invitation of a great nobleman, who did not care for music\nhimself, but kept an orchestra for show. Lemm lived with him seven years\nin the capacity of orchestra conductor, and left him empty-handed. The\nnobleman was ruined, he intended to give him a promissory note, but in\nthe sequel refused him even that--in short, did not pay him a farthing.\nHe was advised to go away; but he was unwilling to return home in\npoverty from Russia, that great Russia which is a mine of gold for\nartists; he decided to remain and try his luck. For twenty years\nthe poor German had been trying his luck; he had lived in various\ngentlemen's houses, had suffered and put up with much, had faced\nprivation, had struggled like a fish on the ice; but the idea of\nreturning to his own country never left him among all the hardships he\nendured; it was this dream alone that sustained him. But fate did\nnot see fit to grant him this last and first happiness: at fifty,\nbroken-down in health and prematurely aged, he drifted to the town of\nO----, and remained there for good, having now lost once for all every\nhope of leaving Russia, which he detested. He gained his poor livelihood\nsomehow by lessons. Lemm's exterior was not prepossessing. He was short\nand bent, with crooked shoulders, and contracted chest, with large flat\nfeet, and bluish white nails on the gnarled bony fingers of his sinewy\nred hands. He had a wrinkled face, sunken cheeks, and compressed lips,\nwhich he was for ever twitching and biting; and this, together with his\nhabitual taciturnity, produced an impression almost sinister. His grey\nhair hung in tufts on his low brow; like smouldering embers, his little\nset eyes glowed with dull fire. He moved painfully, at every step\nswinging his ungainly body forward. Some of his movements recalled the\nclumsy actions of an owl in a cage when it feels that it is being looked\nat, but itself can hardly see out of its great yellow eyes timorously\nand drowsily blinking. Pitiless, prolonged sorrow had laid its indelible\nstamp on the poor musician; it had disfigured and deformed his person,\nby no means attractive to begin with. But any one who was able to get\nover the first impression would have discerned something good, and\nhonest, and out of the common in this half-shattered creature. A devoted\nadmirer of Bach and Handel, a master of his art, gifted with a lively\nimagination and that boldness of conception which is only vouchsafed to\nthe German race, Lemm might, in time--who knows?--have taken rank with\nthe great composers of his fatherland, had his life been different; but\nhe was born under an unlucky star! He had written much in his life, and\nit had not been granted to him to see one of his compositions produced;\nhe did not know how to set about things in the right way, to gain favour\nin the right place, and to make a push at the right moment. A long, long\ntime ago, his one friend and admirer, also a German and also poor, had\npublished two of Lemm's sonatas at his own expense--the whole edition\nremained on the shelves of the music-shops; they disappeared without\na trace, as though they had been thrown into a river by night. At last\nLemm had renounced everything; the years too did their work; his mind\nhad grown hard and stiff, as his fingers had stiffened. He lived alone\nin a little cottage not far from the Kalitin's house, with an old cook\nhe had taken out of the poorhouse (he had never married). He took long\nwalks, and read the Bible and the Protestant version of the Psalms, and\nShakespeare in Schlegel's translation. He had composed nothing for\na long time; but apparently, Lisa, his best pupil, had been able to\ninspire him; he had written for her the cantata to which Panshin had!\nmade allusion. The words of this cantata he had borrowed from his\ncollection of hymns. He had added a few verses of his own. It was sung\nby two choruses--a chorus of the happy and a chorus of the unhappy. The\ntwo were brought into harmony at the end, and sang together, \"Merciful\nGod, have pity on us sinners, and deliver us from all evil thoughts and\nearthly hopes.\" On the title-page was the inscription, most carefully\nwritten and even illuminated, \"Only the righteous are justified. A\nreligious cantata. Composed and dedicated to Miss Elisaveta Kalitin,\nhis dear pupil, by her teacher, C. T. G. Lemm.\" The words, \"Only the\nrighteous are justified\" and \"Elisaveta Kalitin,\" were encircled by\nrays. Below was written: \"For you alone, fur Sie allein.\" This was why\nLemm had grown red, and looked reproachfully at Lisa; he was deeply\nwounded when Panshin spoke of his cantata before him.\n\n\n\nChapter VI\n\n\nPanshin, who was playing bass, struck the first chords of the sonata\nloudly and decisively, but Lisa did not begin her part. He stopped and\nlooked at her. Lisa's eyes were fixed directly on him, and expressed\ndispleasure. There was no smile on her lips, her whole face looked stern\nand even mournful.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why did you not keep your word?\" she said. \"I showed you Christopher\nFedoritch's cantata on the express condition that you said nothing about\nit to him?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Lisaveta Mihalovna, the words slipped out unawares.\"\n\n\"You have hurt his feelings and mine too. Now he will not trust even\nme.\"\n\n\"How could I help it, Lisaveta Mihalovna? Ever since I was a little boy\nI could never see a German without wanting to teaze him.\"\n\n\"How can you say that, Vladimir Nikolaitch? This German is poor, lonely,\nand broken-down--have you no pity for him? Can you wish to teaze him?\"\n\nPanshin was a little taken aback.\n\n\"You are right, Lisaveta Mihalovna,\" he declared. \"It's my everlasting\nthoughtlessness that's to blame. No, don't contradict me; I know myself.\nSo much harm has come to me from my want of thought. It's owing to that\nfailing that I am thought to be an egoist.\"\n\nPanshin paused. With whatever subject he began a conversation, he\ngenerally ended by talking of himself, and the subject was changed by\nhim so easily, so smoothly and genially, that it seemed unconscious.\n\n\"In your own household, for instance,\" he went on, \"your mother\ncertainly wishes me well, she is so kind; you--well, I don't know your\nopinion of me; but on the other hand your aunt simply can't bear me. I\nmust have offended her too by some thoughtless, stupid speech. You know\nI'm not a favourite of hers, am I?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lisa admitted with some reluctance, \"she doesn't like you.\"\n\nPanshin ran his fingers quickly over the keys, and a scarcely\nperceptible smile glided over his lips.\n\n\"Well, and you?\" he said, \"do you too think me an egoist?\"\n\n\"I know you very little,\" replied Lisa, \"but I don't consider you an\negoist; on the contrary, I can't help feeling grateful to you.\"\n\n\"I know, I know what you mean to say,\" Panshin interrupted, and again he\nran his fingers over the keys: \"for the music and the books I bring you,\nfor the wretched sketches with which I adorn your album, and so forth.\nI might do all that--and be an egoist all the same. I venture to think\nthat you don't find me a bore, and don't think me a bad fellow, but\nstill you suppose that I--what's the saying?--would sacrifice friend or\nfather for the sake of a witticism.\"\n\n\"You are careless and forgetful, like all men of the world,\" observed\nLisa, \"that is all.\"\n\nPanshin frowned a little.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"don't let us discuss me any more; let us play our\nsonata. There's only one thing I must beg of you,\" he added, smoothing\nout the leaves of the book on the music stand, \"think what you like of\nme, call me an egoist even--so be it! but don't call me a man of the\nworld; that name's insufferable to me.... Anch 'io sono pittore. I\ntoo am an artist, though a poor one--and that--I mean that I'm a poor\nartist, I shall show directly. Let us begin.\"\n\n\"Very well, let us begin,\" said Lisa.\n\nThe first adagio went fairly successfully though Panshin made more\nthan one false note. His own compositions and what he had practised\nthoroughly he played very nicely, but he played at sight badly. So\nthe second part of the sonata--a rather quick allegro--broke down\ncompletely; at the twentieth bar, Panshin, who was two bars behind, gave\nin, and pushed his chair back with a laugh.\n\n\"No!\" he cried, \"I can't play to-day; it's a good thing Lemm did not\nhear us; he would have had a fit.\"\n\nLisa got up, shut the piano, and turned round to Panshin.\n\n\"What are we going to do?\" she asked.\n\n\"That's just like you, that question! You can never sit with your\nhands idle. Well, if you like let us sketch, since it's not quite dark.\nPerhaps the other muse, the muse of painting--what was her name? I\nhave forgotten... will be more propitious to me. Where's your album? I\nremember, my landscape there is not finished.\"\n\nLisa went into the other room to fetch the album, and Panshin, left\nalone, drew a cambric handkerchief out of his pocket, and rubbed his\nnails and looked as it were critically at his hands. He had beautiful\nwhite hands; on the second finger of his left hand he wore a spiral gold\nring. Lisa came back; Panshin sat down at the window, and opened the\nalbum.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed: \"I see that you have begun to copy my landscape--and\ncapitally too. Excellent! only just here--give me a pencil--the shadows\nare not put in strongly enough. Look.\"\n\nAnd Panshin with a flourish added a few long strokes. He was for ever\ndrawing the same landscape: in the foreground large disheveled trees,\na stretch of meadow in the background, and jagged mountains on the\nhorizon. Lisa looked over his shoulders at his work.\n\n\"In drawing, just as in life generally,\" observed Panshin, holding\nhis head to right and to left, \"lightness and boldness--are the great\nthings.\"\n\nAt that instant Lemm came into the room, and with a stiff bow was about\nto leave it; but Panshin, throwing aside album and pencils, placed\nhimself in his way.\n\n\"Where are you doing, dear Christopher Fedoritch? Aren't you going to\nstay and have tea with us?\"\n\n\"I go home,\" answered Lemm in a surly voice; \"my head aches.\"\n\n\"Oh, what nonsense!--do stop. We'll have an argument about Shakespeare.\"\n\n\"My head aches,\" repeated the old man.\n\n\"We set to work on the sonata of Beethoven without you,\" continued\nPanshin, taking hold of him affectionately and smiling brightly, \"but\nwe couldn't get on at all. Fancy, I couldn't play two notes together\ncorrectly.\"\n\n\"You'd better have sung your song again,\" replied Lemm, removing\nPanshin's hands, and he walked away.\n\nLisa ran after him. She overtook him on the stairs.\n\n\"Christopher Fedoritch, I want to tell you,\" she said to him in German,\naccompanying him over the short green grass of the yard to the gate, \"I\ndid wrong--forgive me.\"\n\nLemm made no answer.\n\n\"I showed Vladimir Nikolaitch your cantata; I felt sure he would\nappreciate it,--and he did like it very much really.\"\n\nLemm stopped.\n\n\"It's no matter,\" he said in Russian, and then added in his own\nlanguage, \"but he cannot understand anything; how is it you don't see\nthat? He's a dilettante--and that's all!\"\n\n\"You are unjust to him,\" replied Lisa, \"he understands everything, and\nhe can do almost everything himself.\"\n\n\"Yes, everything second-rate, cheap, scamped work. That pleases, and he\npleases, and he is glad it is so--and so much the better. I'm not angry;\nthe cantata and I--we are a pair of old fools; I'm a little ashamed, but\nit's no matter.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Christopher Fedoritch,\" Lisa said again.\n\n\"It's no matter,\" he repeated in Russian, \"you're a good girl... but\nhere is some one coming to see you. Goodbye. You are a very good girl.\"\n\nAnd Lemm moved with hastened steps towards the gate, through which had\nentered some gentleman unknown to him in a grey coat and a wide straw\nhat. Bowing politely to him (he always saluted all new faces in the town\nof O-----; from acquaintances he always turned aside in the street--that\nwas the rule he had laid down for himself), Lemm passed by and\ndisappeared behind the fence. The stranger looked after him in\namazement, and after gazing attentively at Lisa, went straight up to\nher.\n\n\n\nChapter VII\n\n\n\"You don't recognise me,\" he said, taking off his hat, \"but I recognise\nyou in spite of its being seven years since I saw you last. You were a\nchild then. I am Lavretsky. Is your mother at home? Can I see her?\"\n\n\"Mamma will be glad to see you,\" replied Lisa; \"she had heard of your\narrival.\"\n\n\"Let me see, I think your name is Elisaveta?\" said Lavretsky, as he went\nup the stairs.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I remember you very well; you had even then a face one doesn't forget.\nI used to bring you sweets in those days.\"\n\nLisa blushed and thought what a queer man. Lavretsky stopped for an\ninstant in the hall. Lisa went into the drawing-room, where Panshin's\nvoice and laugh could be heard; he had been communicating some gossip of\nthe town to Marya Dmitrievna, and Gedeonovksy, who by this time had come\nin from the garden, and he was himself laughing aloud at the story he\nwas telling. At the name of Lavretsky, Marya Dmitrievna was all in a\nflutter. She turned pale and went up to meet him.\n\n\"How do you do, how do you do, my dear cousin?\" she cried in a plaintive\nand almost tearful voice, \"how glad I am to see you!\"\n\n\"How are you, cousin?\" replied Lavretsky, with a friendly pressure of\nher out-stretched hand; \"how has Providence been treating you?\"\n\n\"Sit down, sit down, my dear Fedor Ivanitch. Ah, how glad I am! But let\nme present my daughter Lisa to you.\"\n\n\"I have already introduced myself to Lisaveta Mihalovna,\" interposed\nLavretsky.\n\n\"Monsier Panshin... Sergei Petrovitch Gedeonovsky... Please sit down.\nWhen I look at you, I can hardly believe my eyes. How are you?\"\n\n\"As you see, I'm flourishing. And you, too, cousin--no ill-luck to\nyou!--have grown no thinner in eight years.\"\n\n\"To think how long it is since we met!\" observed Marya Dmitrievna\ndreamily. \"Where have you come from now? Where did you leave... that is,\nI meant to say,\" she put in hastily, \"I meant to say, are you going to\nbe with us for long?\"\n\n\"I have come now from Berlin,\" replied Lavretsky, \"and to-morrow I shall\ngo into the country--probably for a long time.\"\n\n\"You will live at Lavriky, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, not at Lavriky; I have a little place twenty miles from here: I am\ngoing there.\"\n\n\"Is that the little estate that came to you from Glafira Petrovna?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Really, Fedor Ivanitch! You have such a magnificent house at Lavriky.\"\n\nLavretsky knitted his brows a little.\n\n\"Yes... but there's a small lodge in this little property, and I need\nnothing more for a time. That place is the most convenient for me now.\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna was again thrown into such a state of agitation that\nshe became quite stiff, and her hands hung lifeless by her sides.\nPanshin came to her support by entering into conversation with\nLavretsky. Marya Dmitrievna regained her composure, she leaned back in\nher arm-chair and now and then put in a word. But she looked all the\nwhile with such sympathy at her guest, sighed so significantly, and\nshook her head so dejectedly, that the latter at last lost patience and\nasked her rather sharply if she was unwell.\n\n\"Thank God, no,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna; \"why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Oh, I fancied you didn't seem to be quite yourself.\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna assumed a dignified and somewhat offended air. \"If\nthat's how the land lies,\" she thought, \"it's absolutely no matter to\nme; I see, my good fellow, it's all like water on a duck's back for you;\nany other man would have wasted away with grief, but you've grown fat\non it.\" Marya Dmitrievna did not mince matters in her own mind; she\nexpressed herself with more elegance aloud.\n\nLavretsky certainly did not look like the victim of fate. His\nrosy-cheeked typical Russian face, with its large white brow, rather\nthick nose, and wide straight lips seemed breathing with the wild\nhealth of the steppes, with vigorous primaeval energy. He was splendidly\nwell-built, and his fair curly hair stood up on his head like a boy's.\nIt was only in his blue eyes, with their overhanging brows and\nsomewhat fixed look, that one could trace an expression, not exactly\nof melancholy, nor exactly of weariness, and his voice had almost too\nmeasured a cadence.\n\nPanshin meanwhile continued to keep up the conversation. He turned\nit upon the profits of sugar-boiling, on which he had lately read two\nFrench pamphlets, and with modest composure undertook to expound their\ncontents, without mentioning, however, a single word about the source of\nhis information.\n\n\"Good God, it is Fedya!\" came through the half-opened door the voice of\nMarfa Timofyevna in the next room. \"Fedya himself!\" and the old woman\nran hurriedly into the room. Lavretsky had not time to get up from his\nseat before she had him in her arms. \"Let me have a look at you,\" she\nsaid, holding his face off at arm's length. \"Ah! what a splendid fellow\nyou are! You've grown older a little, but not a bit changed for the\nworse, upon my word! But why are you kissing my hands--kiss my face\nif you're not afraid of my wrinkled cheeks. You never asked after\nme--whether your aunt was alive--I warrant: and you were in my arms as\nsoon as you were born, you great rascal! Well, that is nothing to you, I\nsuppose; why should you remember me? But it was a good idea of yours to\ncome back. And pray,\" she added, turning to Marya Dmitrievna, \"have you\noffered him something to eat?\"\n\n\"I don't want anything,\" Lavretsky hastened to declare.\n\n\"Come, you must at least have some tea, my dear. Lord have mercy on us!\nHe has come from I don't know where, and they don't even give him a cup\nof tea! Lisa, run and stir them up, and make haste. I remember he was\ndreadfully greedy when he was a little fellow, and he likes good things\nnow, I daresay.\"\n\n\"My respects, Marfa Timofyevna,\" said Panshin, approaching the delighted\nold lady from one side with a low bow.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" replied Marfa Timofyevna, \"for not observing you in my\ndelight. You have grown like your mother, the poor darling,\" she went on\nturning again to Lavretsky, \"but your nose was always your father's, and\nyour father's it has remained. Well, and are you going to be with us for\nlong?\"\n\n\"I am going to-morrow, aunt.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Home to Vassilyevskoe.\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Well, if to-morrow it must be. God bless you--you know best. Only mind\nyou come and say good-bye to me.\" The old woman patted his cheek. \"I did\nnot think I should be here to see you; not that I have made up my mind\nto die yet a while--I shall last another ten years, I daresay: all we\nPestovs live long; your late grandfather used to say we had two lives;\nbut you see there was no telling how much longer you were going to\ndangle about abroad. Well, you're a fine lad, a fine lad; can you lift\ntwenty stone with one hand as you used to do, eh? Your late pap was\nfantastical in some things, if I may say so; but he did well in having\nthat Swiss to bring you up; do you remember you used to fight with your\nfists with him?--gymnastics, wasn't it they called it? But there, why I\nam gabbling away like this; I have only been hindering Mr. PanSHIN (she\nnever pronounced his name PANshin as was correct) from holding forth.\nBesides, we'd better go and have tea; yes, let's go on to the terrace,\nmy boy, and drink it there; we have some real cream, not like what\nyou get in your Londons and Parises. Come along, come along, and you,\nFedusha, give me your arm. Oh! but what an arm it is! Upon my word, no\nfear of my stumbling with you!\"\n\nEvery one got up and went out on to the terrace, except Gedeonovsky, who\nquietly took his departure. During the whole of Lavretsky's conversation\nwith Marya Dmitrievna, Panshin, and Marfa Timofyevna, he sat in a\ncorner, blinking attentively, with an open mouth of childish curiosity;\nnow he was in haste to spread the news of the new arrival through the\ntown.\n\nAt eleven o'clock on the evening of the same day, this is what was\nhappening in Madame Kalitin's house. Downstairs, Vladimir Nikolaitch,\nseizing a favourable moment, was taking leave of Lisa at the\ndrawing-room door, and saying to her, as he held her hand, \"You know who\nit is draws me here; you know why I am constantly coming to your house;\nwhat need of words when all is clear as it is?\" Lisa did not speak,\nand looked on the ground, without smiling, with her brows slightly\ncontracted, and a flush on her cheek, but she did not draw away her\nhands. While up-stairs, in Marfa Timofyevna's room, by the light of a\nlittle lamp hanging before the tarnished old holy images, Lavretsky was\nsitting in a low chair, his elbows on his knees and his face buried in\nhis hands; the old woamn, standing before him, now and then silently\nstroked his hair. He spent more than an hour with her, after taking\nleave of his hostess; he had scarcely said anything to his kind old\nfriend, and she did not question him.... Indeed, what need to speak,\nwhat was there to ask? Without that she understood all, and felt for\neverything of which his heart was full.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII\n\n\nFedor Ivanitch Lavretsky--we must ask the reader's permission to break\noff the thread of our story for a time--came of an old noble family. The\nfounder of the house of Lavretskky came over from Prussia in the reign\nof Vassili the Blind, and received a grant of two hundred chetverts of\nland in Byezhetsk. Many of his descendants filled various offices, and\nserved under princes and persons of eminence in outlying districts,\nbut not one of them rose above the rank of an inspector of the Imperial\ntable nor acquired any considerable fortune. The richest and\nmost distinguished of all the Lavretskys was Fedor Ivanitch's\ngreat-grandfather, Andrei, a man cruel and daring, cunning and able.\nEven to this day stories still linger of his tyranny, his savage temper,\nhis reckless munificence, and his insatiable avarice. He was very stout\nand tall, swarthy of countenance and beardless, he spoke in a thick\nvoice and seemed half asleep; but the more quietly he spoke the more\nthose about him trembled. He had managed to get a wife who was a fit\nmatch for him. She was a gipsy by birth, goggle-eyed and hook-nosed,\nwith a round yellow face. She was irascible and vindictive, and never\ngave way in anything to her husband, who almost killed her, and whose\ndeath she did not survive, though she had been for ever quarrelling with\nhim. The son of Andrei, Piotr, Fedor's grandfather, did not take\nafter his father; he was a typical landowner of the steppes, rather a\nsimpleton, loud-voiced, but slow to move, coarse but not ill-natured,\nhospitable and very fond of coursing with dogs. He was over thirty when\nhe inherited from his father a property of two thousand serfs in capital\ncondition; but he had soon dissipated it, and had partly mortgaged\nhis estate, and demoralised his servants. All sorts of people of low\nposition, known and unknown, came crawling like cockroaches from all\nparts into his spacious, warm, ill-kept halls. All this mass of people\nate what they could get, but always had their fill, drank till they\nwere drunk, and carried off what they could, praising and blessing\ntheir genial host; and their host too when he was out humour blessed\nhis guests--for a pack of sponging toadies, but he was bored when he was\nwithout them. Piotr Andreitch's wife was a meek-spirited creature; he\nhad taken her from a neighbouring family by his father's choice and\ncommand; her name was Anna Pavlovna. She never interfered in anything,\nwelcomed guests cordially, and readily paid visits herself, though being\npowdered, she used to declare, would be the death of her. \"They put,\"\nshe used to say in her old age, \"a fox's brush on your head, comb all\nthe hair up over it, smear it with grease, and dust it over with flour,\nand stick it up with iron pins,--there's no washing it off afterwards;\nbut to pay visits without powder was quite impossible--people would be\noffended. Ah, it was a torture!\"\n\nShe liked being driven with fast-trotting horses, and was ready to play\ncards from morning till evening, and would always keep the score of the\npennies she had lost or won hidden under her hand when her husband came\nnear the card-table; but all her dowry, her whole fortune, she had put\nabsolutely at his disposal. She bore him two children, a son Ivan, the\nfather of Fedor, and a daughter Glafira. Ivan was not brought up at\nhome, but lived with a rich old maiden aunt, the Princess Kubensky; she\nhad fixed on him for her heir (but for that his father would not have\nlet him go). She dressed him up like a doll, engaged all kinds of\nteachers for him, and put him in charge of a tutor, a Frenchman, who had\nbeen an abbe, a pupil of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, a certain M. Courtin de\nVaucelles, a subtle and wily intriguer--the very, as she expressed it,\nfine fleur of emigration--and finished at almost seventy years old by\nmarrying this \"fine fleur,\" and making over all her property to him.\nSoon afterwards, covered with rouge, and redolent of perfume a la\nRichelieu, surrounded by negro boys, delicate-shaped greyhounds and\nshrieking parrots, she died on a crooked silken divan of the time of\nLouis XV., with an enamelled snuff-box of Petitot's workmanship in her\nhand--and died, deserted by her husband; the insinuating M. Courtin had\npreferred to remove to Paris with her money. Ivan had only reached\nhis twentieth year when this unexpected blow (we mean the princess's\nmarriage, not her death) fell upon him; he did not care to stay in his\naunt's house, where he found himself suddenly transformed from a wealthy\nheir to a poor relation; the society in Petersburg in which he had grown\nup was closed to him; he felt an aversion for entering the government\nservice in the lower grades, with nothing but hard work and obscurity\nbefore him,--this was at the very beginning of the reign of the Emperor\nAlexander. He was obliged reluctantly to return to the country to his\nfather. How squalid, poor, and wretched his parents' home seemed to him!\nThe stagnation and sordidness of life in the country offended him at\nevery step. He was consumed with ennui. Moreover, every one in the\nhouse, except his mother, looked at him with unfriendly eyes. His father\ndid not like his town manners, his swallow-tail coats, his frilled\nshirt-fronts, his books, his flute, his fastidious ways, in which he\ndetected--not incorrectly--a disgust for his surroundings; he was for\never complaining and grumbling at his son. \"Nothing here,\" he used to\nsay, \"is to his taste; at table he is all in a fret, and doesn't eat;\nhe can't bear the heat and close smell of the room; the sight of folks\ndrunk upsets him, one daren't beat any one before him; he doesn't want\nto go into the government service; he's weakly, as you see, in health;\nfie upon him, the milksop! And all this because he's got his head full\nof Voltaire.\" The old man had a special dislike to Voltaire, and the\n\"fanatic\" Diderot, though he had not read a word of their words; reading\nwas not in his line. Piotr Andreitch was not mistaken; his son's head\nfor that matter was indeed full of both Diderot and Voltaire, and not\nonly of them alone, of Rousseau too, and Helvetius, and many other\nwriters of the same kind--but they were in his head only. The retired\nabbe and encyclopedist who had been Ivan Petrovitch's tutor had taken\npleasure in pouring all the wisdom of the eighteenth century into his\npupil, and he was simply brimming over with it; it was there in him, but\nwithout mixing in his blood, nor penetrating to his soul, nor shaping\nitself in any firm convictions.... But, indeed, could one expect\nconvictions from a young man of fifty years ago, when even at the\npresent day we have not succeeded in attaining them? The guests, too,\nwho frequented his father's house, were oppressed by Ivan Petrovitch's\npresence; he regarded them with loathing, they were afraid of him; and\nwith his sister Glafira, who was twelve years older than he, he could\nnot get on at all. This Glafira was a strange creature; she was ugly,\ncrooked, and spare, with severe, wide-open eyes, and thin compressed\nlips. In her face, her voice, and her quick angular movements, she took\nafter her grandmother, the gipsy, Andrei's wife. Obstinate and fond\nof power, she would not even hear of marriage. The return of Ivan\nPetrovitch did not fit in with her plans; while the Princess Kubensky\nkept him with her, she had hoped to receive at least half of her\nfather's estate; in her avarice, too, she was like her grandmother.\nBesides, Glafira envied her brother, he was so well educated, spoke\nsuch good French with a Parisian accent, while she was scarcely able\nto pronounce \"bon jour\" or \"comment vous portez-vous.\" To be sure, her\nparents did not know any French, but that was no comfort to her. Ivan\nPetrovitch did not know what to do with himself for wretchedness and\nennui; he had spent hardly a year in the country, but that year seemed\nto him as long as ten. The only consolation he could find was in talking\nto his mother, and he would sit for whole hours in her low-pitched\nrooms, listening to the good woman's simple-hearted prattle, and eating\npreserves. It so happened that among Anna Pavlovna's maids there was one\nvery pretty girl with clear soft eyes and refined features, Malanya by\nname, an modest intelligent creature. She took his fancy at first sight,\nand he fell in love with her: he fell in love with her timid movements,\nher bashful answers, her gentle voice and gentle smile; every day she\nseemed sweeter to him. And she became devoted to Ivan Petrovitch\nwith all the strength of her soul, as none but Russian girls can be\ndevoted--and she gave herself to him. In the large household of a\ncountry squire nothing can long be kept a secret; soon every one knew of\nthe love between the young master and Malanya; the gossip even reached\nthe ears of Piotr Andreitch himself. Under other circumstances, he would\nprobably have paid no attention to a matter of so little importance,\nbut he had long had a grudge against his son, and was delighted at an\nopportunity of humiliating the town-bred wit and dandy. A storm of\nfuss and clamour was raised; Malanya was locked up in the pantry, Ivan\nPetrovitch was summoned into his father's presence. Anna Pavlovna too\nran up at the hubbub. She began trying to pacify her husband, but Piotr\nAndreitch would hear nothing. He pounced down like a hawk on his son,\nreproached him with immorality, with godlessness, with hypocrisy; he\ntook the opportunity to vent on him all the wrath against the Princess\nKubensky that had been simmering within him, and lavished abusive\nepithets upon him. At first Ivan Petrovitch was silent and held himself\nin, but when his father thought to fit to threaten him with a shameful\npunishment he could endure it no longer. \"Ah,\" he thought, \"the fanatic\nDiderot is brought out again, then I will take the bull by the horns, I\nwill astonish you all.\" And thereupon with a calm and even voice, though\nquaking inwardly in every limb, Ivan Petrovitch declared to his father,\nthat there was no need to reproach him with immorality; that though he\ndid not intend to justify his fault he was ready to make amends for it,\nthe more willingly as he felt himself to be superior to every kind of\nprejudice--and in fact--was ready to marry Malanya. In uttering\nthese words Ivan Petrovitch did undoubtedly attain his object; he so\nastonished Piotr Andreitch that the latter stood open-eyed, and was\nstruck dumb for a moment; but instantly he came to himself, and just as\nhe was, in a dressing-gown bordered with squirrel fur and slippers on\nhis bare feet, he flew at Ivan Petrovitch with his fists. The latter,\nas though by design, had that morning arranged his locks a la Titus,\nand put on a new English coat of a blue colour, high boots with little\ntassels and very tight modish buckskin breeches. Anna Pavlovna shrieked\nwith all her might and covered her face with her hands; but her son ran\nover the whole house, dashed out into the courtyard, rushed into the\nkitchen-garden, into the pleasure-grounds, and flew across into the\nroad, and kept running without looking round till at last he ceased to\nhear the heavy tramp of his father's steps behind him and his shouts,\njerked out with effort, \"Stop you scoundrel!\" he cried, \"stop! or I\nwill curse you!\" Ivan Petrovitch took refuge with a neighbour, a small\nlandowner, and Piotr Andreitch returned home worn out and perspiring,\nand without taking breath, announced that he should deprive his son of\nhis blessing and inheritance, gave orders that all his foolish books\nshould be burnt, and that the girl Malanya should be sent to a distant\nvillage without loss of time. Some kind-hearted people found out Ivan\nPetrovitch and let him know everything. Humiliated and driven to fury,\nhe vowed he would be revenged on his father, and the same night lay\nin wait for the peasant's cart in which Malanya was being driven away,\ncarried her off by force, galloped off to the nearest town with her and\nmarried her. He was supplied with money by the neighbour, a good-natured\nretired marine officer, a confirmed tippler, who took an intense delight\nin every kind of--as he expressed it--romantic story.\n\nThe next day Ivan Petrovitch wrote an ironically cold and polite letter\nto Piotr Andreitch, and set off to the village where lived his second\ncousin, Dmitri Pestov, with his sister, already known to the reader,\nMarfa Timofyevna. He told them all, announced his intention to go to\nPetersburg to try to obtain a post there, and besought them, at least\nfor a time, to give his wife a home. At the word \"wife\" he shed tears,\nand in spite of his city breeding and philosophy he bowed himself in\nhumble, supplicating Russian fashion at his relations' feet, and even\ntouched the ground with his forehead. The Pestovs, kind-hearted and\ncompassionate people, readily agreed to his request. He stayed with\nthem for three weeks, secretly expecting a reply from his father; but no\nreply came--and there was no chance of a reply coming.\n\nPiotr Andreitch, on hearing of his son's marriage, took to his bed,\nand forbade Ivan Petrovitch's name to be mentioned before him; but his\nmother, without her husband's knowledge, borrowed from the rector,\nand sent 500 roubles and a little image to his wife. She was afraid\nto write, but sent a message to Ivan Petrovitch by a lean peasant, who\ncould walk fifty miles a day, that he was not to take it too much to\nheart; that, please God, all would be arranged, and his father's\nwrath would be turned to kindness; that she too would have preferred\na different daughter-in-law, but that she sent Malanya Sergyevna her\nmotherly blessing. The lean peasant received a rouble, asked permission\nto see the new young mistress, to whom he happened to be godfather,\nkissed her hand and ran off at his best speed.\n\nAnd Ivan Petrovitch set off to Petersburg with a light heart. An unknown\nfuture awaited him; poverty perhaps menaced him, but he had broken away\nfrom the country life he detested, and above all, he had not been false\nto his teachers, he had actually put into practice the doctrines of\nRousseau, Diderot, and la Declaration des droits de l'homme. A sense\nof having done his duty, of triumph, and of pride filled his soul; and\nindeed the separation from his wife did not greatly afflict him; he\nwould have been more perturbed by the necessity of being constantly\nwith her. That deed was done, now he wanted to set about doing something\nfresh. In Petersburg, contrary to his own expectations, he met with\nsuccess; the Princess Kubensky, whom Monsieur Courtin had by that time\ndeserted, but who was still living, in order to make up in some way to\nher nephew for having wronged him, gave him introductions to all her\nfriends, and presented him with 5000 roubles--almost all that remained\nof her money--and a Lepkovsky watch with his monogram encircled by\nCupids.\n\nThree months had not passed before he obtained a position in a Russian\nembassy to London, and in the first English vessel that sailed (steamers\nwere not even talked of then) he crossed the sea. A few months later he\nreceived a letter from Pestov. The good-natured landowner congratulated\nIvan Petrovitch on the birth of a son, who had been born into the world\nin the village of Pokrovskoe on the 20th of August, 1807, and named\nFedor, in honour of the holy martyr Fedor Stratilat. On account of her\nextreme weakness Malanya Sergyevna added only a few lines; but those\nfew lines were a surprise, for Ivan Petrovitch had not known that Marfa\nTimofyevna had taught his wife to read and write. Ivan Petrovitch did\nnot long abandon himself to the sweet emotion of parental feeling;\nhe was dancing attendance on a notorious Phryne or Lais of the day\n(classical names were still in vogue at that date); the Peace of Tilsit\nhad only just been concluded and all the world was hurrying after\npleasure, in a giddy whirl of dissipation, and his head had been turned\nby the black eyes of a bold beauty. He had very little money, but he\nwas lucky at cards, made many acquaintances, took part in all\nentertainments, in a word, he was in the swim.\n\n\n\nChapter IX\n\n\nFor a long time the old Lavretsky could not forgive his son for his\nmarriage. If six months later Ivan Petrovitch had come to him with a\npenitent face and had thrown himself at his feet, he would, very likely,\nhave pardoned him, after giving him a pretty severe scolding, and a tap\nwith his stick by way of intimidating him, but Ivan Petrovitch went on\nliving abroad and apparently did not care a straw. \"Be silent! I dare\nyou to speak of it,\" Piotr Andreitch said to his wife every time she\nventured to try to incline him to mercy. \"The puppy, he ought to thank\nGod for ever that I have not laid my curse upon him; my father would\nhave killed him, the worthless scamp, with his own hands, and he would\nhave done right too.\" At such terrible speeches Anna Pavlovna could only\ncross herself secretly. As for Ivan Petrovitch's wife, Piotr Andreitch\nat first would not even hear her name, and in answer to a letter of\nPestov's, in which he mentioned his daughter-in-law, he went so far as\nto send him word that he knew nothing of any daughter-in-law, and that\nit was forbidden by law to harbour run-away wenches, a fact which he\nthought it his duty to remind him of. But later on, he was softened by\nhearing of the birth of a grandson, and he gave orders secretly that\ninquiries should be made about the health of the mother, and sent her a\nlittle money, also as though it did not come from him. Fedya was not\na year old before Anna Pavlovna fell ill with a fatal complaint. A few\ndays before her end, when she could no longer leave her bed, with timid\ntears in her eyes, fast growing dim, she informed her husband in the\npresence of the priest that she wanted to see her daughter-in-law\nand bid her farewell, and to give her grand-child her blessing. The\nheart-broken old man soothed her, and at once sent off his own carriage\nfor his daughter-in-law, for the first time giving her the title of\nMalanya Sergyevna. Malanya came with her son and Marfa Timofyevna, who\nwould not on any consideration allow her to go alone, and was unwilling\nto expose her to any indignity. Half dead with fright, Malanya Sergyevna\nwent into Piotr Andreitch's room. A nurse followed, carrying Fedya.\nPiotr Andreitch looked at her without speaking; she went up to kiss his\nhand; her trembling lips were only just able to touch it with a silent\nkiss.\n\n\"Well, my upstart lady,\" he brought out at last, \"how do you do? let us\ngo to the mistress.\"\n\nHe got up and bent over Fedya: the baby smiled and held out his little\nwhite hands to him. This changed the old man's mood.\n\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"poor little one, you were pleading for your father; I\nwill not abandon you, little bird.\"\n\nDirectly Malanya Sergyevna entered Anna Pavlovna's bedroom, she fell\non her knees near the door. Anna Pavlovna beckoned her to come to\nher bedside, embraced her, and blessed her son; then turning a face\ncontorted by cruel suffering to her husband she made an effort to speak.\n\n\"I know, I know, what you want to ask,\" said Piotr Andreitch; \"don't\nfret yourself, she shall stay with us, and I will forgive Vanka for her\nsake.\"\n\nWith an effort Anna Pavlovna took her husband's hand and pressed it to\nher lips. The same evening she breathed her last.\n\nPiotr Andreitch kept his word. He informed his son that for the sake of\nhis mother's dying hours, and for the sake of the little Fedor, he sent\nhim his blessing and was keeping Malanya Sergyevna in his house. Two\nrooms on the ground floor were devoted to her; he presented her to his\nmost honoured guests, the one-eyed brigadier Skurchin, and his wife,\nand bestowed on her two waiting-maids and a page for errands. Marfa\nTimofyevna took leave of her; she detested Glafira, and in the course of\none day had fallen out with her three times.\n\nIt was a painful and embarrassing position at first for poor Malanya,\nbut, after a while, she learnt to bear it, and grew used to her\nfather-in-law. He, too, grew accustomed to her, and even fond of her,\nthough he scarcely ever spoke to her, and a certain involuntary contempt\nwas perceptible even in his signs of affection to her. Malanya Sergyevna\nhad most to put up with from her sister-in-law. Even during her\nmother's lifetime, Glafira had succeeded by degrees in getting the whole\nhousehold into her hands; every one from her father downwards, submitted\nto her rule; not a piece of sugar was given out without her sanction;\nshe would rather have died than shared her authority with another\nmistress--and with such a mistress! Her brother's marriage had incensed\nher even more than Piotr Andreitch; she set herself to give the upstart\na lesson, and Malanya Sergyevna from the very first hour was her slave.\nAnd, indeed, how was she to contend against the masterful, haughty\nGlafira, submissive, constantly bewildered, timid, and weak in health\nas she was? Not a day passed without Glafira reminding her of her\nformer position, and commending her for not forgetting herself. Malanya\nSergyevna could have reconciled herself readily to these reminiscences\nand commendations, however they might be--but Fedya was taken away from\nher, that was what crushed her. On the pretext that she was not capable\nof undertaking his education, she was scarcely allowed to see him;\nGlafira set herself to that task; the child was put absolutely under\nher control. Malanya Sergyevna began, in her distress, to beseech Ivan\nPetrovitch, in her letters, to return home soon. Piotr Andreitch himself\nwanted to see his son, but Ivan Petrovitch did nothing but write. He\nthanked his father on his wife's account, and for the money sent him,\npromised to return quickly--and did not come. The year 1812 at last\nsummoned him home from abroad. When they met again, after six years'\nabsence, the father embraced his son, and not by a single word made\nallusion to their former differences; it was not a time for that now,\nall Russia was rising up against the enemy, and both of them felt that\nthey had Russian blood in their veins. Piotr Andreitch equipped a whole\nregiment of volunteers at his own expense. But the war came to an end,\nthe danger was over; Ivan Petrovitch began to be bored again, and again\nhe felt drawn away to the distance, to the world in which he had grown\nup, and where he felt himself at home. Malanya Sergyevna could not\nkeep him; she meant too little to him. Even her fondest hopes came\nto nothing; her husband considered that it was much more suitable to\nintrust Fedya's education to Glafira. Ivan Petrovitch's poor wife could\nnot bear this blow, she could not bear a second separation; in a few\ndays, without a murmur, she quietly passed away. All her life she had\nnever been able to oppose anything, and she did not struggle against her\nillness. When she could no longer speak, when the shadows of death\nwere already on her face, her features expressed, as of old, bewildered\nresignation and constant, uncomplaining meekness; with the same dumb\nsubmissiveness she looked at Glafira, and just as Anna Pavlovna kissed\nher husband's hand on her deathbed, she kissed Glafira's, commending to\nher, to Glafira, her only son. So ended the earthly existence of this\ngood and gentle creature, torn, God knows why, like an uprooted tree\nfrom its natural soil and at once thrown down with its roots in the air;\nshe had faded and passed away leaving no trace, and no one mourned\nfor her. Malanya Sergyevna's maids pitied her, and so did even Piotr\nAndreitch. The old man missed her silent presence. \"Forgive me...\nfarewell, my meek one!\" he whispered, as he took leave of her the last\ntime in church. He wept as he threw a handful of earth in the grave.\n\nHe did not survive her long, not more than five years. In the winter\nof the year 1819, he died peacefully in Moscow, where he had moved with\nGlafira and his grandson, and left instructions that he should be buried\nbeside Anna Pavlovna and \"Malasha.\" Ivan Petrovitch was then in Paris\namusing himself; he had retired from service soon after 1815. When\nhe heard of his father's death he decided to return to Russia. It was\nnecessary to make arrangements for the management of the property.\nFedya, according to Glafira's letter, had reached his twelfth year, and\nthe time had come to set about his education in earnest.\n\n\n\nChapter X\n\n\nIvan Petrovitch returned to Russia an Anglomaniac. His short-cropped\nhair, his starched shirt-front, his long-skirted pea-green overcoat\nwith its multitude of capes, the sour expression of his face, something\nabrupt and at the same time indifferent in his behaviour, his way of\nspeaking through his teeth, his sudden wooden laugh, the absence of\nsmiles, his exclusively political or politic-economical conversation,\nhis passion for roast beef and port wine--everything about him breathed,\nso to speak, of Great Britain. But, marvelous to relate, while he had\nbeen transformed into an Anglomaniac, Ivan Petrovitch had at the same\ntime become a patriot, at least he called himself a patriot, though\nhe knew Russia little, had not retained a single Russian habit, and\nexpressed himself in Russian rather queerly; in ordinary conversation,\nhis language was spiritless and inanimate and constantly interspersed\nwith Gallicisms.\n\nIvan Petrovitch brought with him a few schemes in manuscript, relating\nto the administration and reform of the government; he was much\ndispleased with everything he saw; the lack of system especially\naroused his spleen. On his meeting with his sister, at the first word\nhe announced to her that he was determined to introduce radical reforms,\nthat henceforth everything to do with him would be on a different\nsystem. Glafira Petrovna made no reply to Ivan Petrovitch; she only\nground her teeth and thought: \"Where am I to take refuge?\" After she\nwas back in the country, however, with her brother and nephew, her fears\nwere soon set at rest. In the house, certainly, some changes were made;\nidlers and dependants met with summary dismissal; among them two old\nwomen were made to suffer, one blind, another broken down by paralysis;\nand also a decrepit major of the days of Catherine, who, on account of\nhis really abnormal appetite, was fed on nothing but black bread and\nlentils. The order went forth not to admit the guests of former days;\nthey were replaced by a distant neighbour, a certain fair-haired,\nscrofulous baron, a very well educated and very stupid man. New\nfurniture was brought from Moscow; spittoons were introduced, and bells\nand washing-stands; and breakfast began to be served in a different way;\nforeign wines replaced vodka and syrups; the servants were put into\nnew livery; a motto was added to the family arms: in recto virtus...\nIn reality, Glafira's power suffered no diminution; the giving out and\nbuying of stores still depended on her. The Alsatian steward, brought\nfrom abroad, tried to fight it out with her and lost his place, in spite\nof the master's protection. As for the management of the house, and\nthe administration of the estate, Glafira Petrovna had undertaken these\nduties also; in spite of Ivan Petrovitch's intention,--more than once\nexpressed--to breathe new life into this chaos, everything remained as\nbefore; only the rent was in some places raised, the mistress was\nmore strict, and the peasants were forbidden to apply direct to\nIvan Petrovitch. The patriot had already a great contempt for his\nfellow-countrymen. Ivan Petrovitch's system was applied in its\nfull force only to Fedya; his education really underwent a \"radical\nreformation;\" his father devoted himself exclusively to it.\n\n\n\nChapter XI\n\n\nUntil Ivan Petrovitch's return from abroad, Fedya was, as already\nrelated, in the hands of Glafira Petrovna. He was not eight years\nold when his mother died; he did not see her every day, and loved her\npassionately; the memory of her, of her pale and gentle face, of her\ndejected looks and timid caresses, was imprinted on his heart for\never; but he vaguely understood her position in the house; he felt that\nbetween him and her there existed a barrier which she dared not and\ncould not break down. He was shy of his father, and, indeed, Ivan\nPetrovitch on his side never caressed him; his grandfather sometimes\npatted him on the head and gave him his hand to kiss, but he thought him\nand called him a little fool. After the death of Malanya Sergyevna, his\naunt finally got him under her control. Fedya was afraid of her: he was\nafraid of her bright sharp eyes and her harsh voice; he dared not utter\na sound in her presence; often, when he only moved a little in his\nchair, she would! hiss out at once: \"What are you doing? sit still.\"\nOn Sundays, after mass, he was allowed to play, that is to say, he\nwas given a thick book, a mysterious book, the work of a certain\nMaimovitch-Ambodik, entitled \"Symbols and Emblems.\" This book was a\nmedley of about a thousand mostly very enigmatical pictures, and as many\nenigmatical interpretations of them in five languages. Cupid--naked and\nvery puffy in the body--played a leading part in these illustrations.\nIn one of them, under the heading, \"Saffron and the Rainbow,\" the\ninterpretation appended was: \"Of this, the influence is vast;\" opposite\nanother, entitled \"A heron, flying with a violet in his beak,\" stood the\ninscription: \"To thee they are all known.\" \"Cupid and the bear licking\nhis fur\" was inscribed, \"Little by little.\" Fedya used to ponder over\nthese pictures; he knew them all to the minutest details; some of them,\nalways the same ones, used to set him dreaming, and afforded him food\nfor meditation; he! knew no other amusements. When the time came to\nteach him languages and music, Glafira Petrovna engaged, for next to\nnothing, an old maid, a Swede, with eyes like a hare's, who spoke French\nand German with mistakes in every alternate word, played after a fashion\non the piano, and above all, salted cucumbers to a perfection. In\nthe society of this governess, his aunt, and the old servant maid,\nVassilyevna, Fedya spent four whole years. Often he would sit in the\ncorner with his \"Emblems\"; he sat there endlessly; there was a scent\nof geranium in the low pitched room, the solitary candle burnt dim, the\ncricket chirped monotonously, as though it were weary, the little clock\nticked away hurriedly on the wall, a mouse scratched stealthily and\ngnawed at the wall-paper, and the three old women, like the Fates,\nswiftly and silently plied their knitting needles, the shadows raced\nafter their hands and quivered strangely in the half darkness, and\nstrange, half dark ideas swarmed in the child's brain. No one would\nhave called Fedya an interesting child; he was rather pale, but stout,\nclumsily built and awkward--a thorough peasant, as Glafira Petrovna\nsaid; the pallor would soon have vanished from his cheeks, if he had\nbeen allowed oftener to be in the open air. He learnt fairly quickly,\nthough he was often lazy; he never cried, but at times he was overtaken\nby a fit of savage obstinacy; then no one could soften him. Fedya loved\nno one among those around him.... Woe to the heart that has not loved in\nyouth!\n\nThus Ivan Petrovitch found him, and without loss of time he set to work\nto apply his system to him.\n\n\"I want above all to make a man, un homme, of him,\" he said to Glafira\nPetrovna, \"and not only a man, but a Spartan.\" Ivan Petrovitch began\ncarrying out his intentions by putting his son in a Scotch kilt; the\ntwelve-year-old boy had to go about with bare knees and a plume stuck\nin his Scotch cap. The Swedish lady was replaced by a young Swiss tutor,\nwho was versed in gymnastics to perfection. Music, as a pursuit unworthy\nof a man, was discarded. The natural sciences, international law,\nmathematics, carpentry, after Jean-Jacques Rousseau's precept, and\nheraldry, to encourage chivalrous feelings, were what the future \"man\"\nwas to be occupied with. He was waked at four o'clock in the morning,\nsplashed at once with cold water and set to running round a high pole\nwith a cord; he had only one meal a day, consisting of a single\ndish; rode on horseback; shot with a cross-bow; at every convenient\nopportunity he was exercised in acquiring after his parent's example\nfirmness of will, and every evening he inscribed in a special book an\naccount of the day and his impressions; and Ivan Petrovitch on his side\nwrote him instructions in French in which he called him mon fils, and\naddressed him as vous. In Russian Fedya called his father thou, but\ndid not dare to sit down in his presence. The \"system\" dazed the boy,\nconfused and cramped his intellect, but his health on the other hand was\nbenefited by the new manner of his life; at first he fell into a fever\nbut soon recovered and began to grow stout and strong. His father was\nproud of him and called him in his strange jargon \"a child of nature,\nmy creation.\" When Fedya had reached his sixteenth year, Ivan Petrovitch\nthought it his duty in good time to instil into him a contempt for the\nfemale sex; and the young Spartan, with timidity in his heart and the\nfirst down on his lip, full of sap and strength and young blood, already\ntried to seem indifferent, cold, and rude.\n\nMeanwhile time was passing. Ivan Petrovitch spent the great part of the\nyear in Lavriky (that was the name of the principal estate inherited\nfrom his ancestors). But in the winter he used to go to Moscow alone;\nthere he stayed at a tavern, diligently visited the club, made speeches\nand developed his plans in drawing-rooms, and in his behaviour was more\nthan ever Anglomaniac, grumbling and political. But the year 1825 came\nand brought much sorrow. Intimate friends and acquaintances of Ivan\nPetrovitch underwent painful experiences. Ivan Petrovitch made haste to\nwithdraw into the country and shut himself up in his house. Another year\npassed by, and suddenly Ivan Petrovitch grew feeble, and ailing; his\nhealth began to break up. He, the free-thinker, began to go to church\nand have prayers put up for him; he, the European, began to sit in\nsteam-baths, to dine at two o'clock, to go to bed at nine, and to doze\noff to the sound of the chatter of the old steward; he, the man of!\npolitical ideas, burnt all his schemes, all his correspondence, trembled\nbefore the governor, and was uneasy at the sigh of the police-captain;\nhe, the man of iron will, whimpered and complained, when he had a\ngumboil or when they gave him a plate of cold soup. Glafira Petrovna\nagain took control of everything in the house; once more the overseers,\nbailiffs and simple peasants began to come to the back stairs to speak\nto the \"old witch,\" as the servants called her. The change in Ivan\nPetrovitch produced a powerful impression on his son. He had now reached\nhis nineteenth year, and had begun to reflect and to emancipate himself\nfrom the hand that pressed like a weight upon him. Even before this\ntime he had observed a little discrepancy between his father's words and\ndeeds, between his wide liberal theories and his harsh petty despotism;\nbut he had not expected such a complete breakdown. His confirmed egoism\nwas patent now in everything. Young Lavretsky was getting ready! to go\nto Moscow, to prepare for the university, when a new unexpected calamity\novertook Ivan Petrovitch; he became blind, and hopelessly blind, in one\nday.\n\nHaving no confidence in the skill of Russian doctors, he began to make\nefforts to obtain permission to go abroad. It was refused. Then he took\nhis son with him and for three whole years was wandering about Russia,\nfrom one doctor to another, incessantly moving from one town to another,\nand driving his physicians, his son, and his servants to despair by\nhis cowardice and impatience. He returned to Lavriky a perfect wreck, a\ntearful and capricious child. Bitter days followed, every one had much\nto put up with from him. Ivan Petrovitch was only quiet when he was\ndining; he had never been so greedy and eaten so much; all the rest\nof the time he gave himself and others no peace. He prayed, cursed his\nfate, abused himself, abused politics, his system, abused everything he\nhad boasted of and prided himself upon, everything he had held up to his\nson as a model; he declared that he believed in nothing and then began\nto pray again; he could not put up with one instant of solitude, and\nexpected his household to sit by his chair continually day and night,\nand entertain him with stories, which he constantly interrupted with\nexclamations, \"You are for ever lying,... a pack of nonsense!\"\n\nGlafira Petrovna was specially necessary to him; he absolutely could not\nget on without her--and to the end she always carried out every whim of\nthe sick man, though sometimes she could not bring herself to answer\nat once for fear the sound of her voice should betray her inward anger.\nThus he lingered on for two years and died on the first day of May,\nwhen he had been brought out on to the balcony into the sun. \"Glasha,\nGlashka! soup, soup, old foo----\" his halting tongue muttered and before he\nhad articulated the last word, it was silent for ever. Glafira Petrovna,\nwho had only just taken the cup of soup from the hands of the steward,\nstopped, looked at her brother's face, slowly made a large sign of the\ncross and turned away in silence; and his son, who happened to be there,\nalso said nothing; he leaned on the railing of the balcony and gazed a\nlong while into the garden, all fragrant and green, and shining in the\nrays of the golden sunshine of spring. He was twenty-three years old;\nhow terribly, how imperceptibly quickly those twenty-three years had\npassed by!... Life was opening before him.\n\n\n\nChapter XII\n\n\nAfter burying his father and intrusting to the unchanged Glafira\nPetrovna the management of his estate and superintendence of his\nbailiffs, young Lavretsky went to Moscow, whither he felt drawn by a\nvague but strong attraction. He recognised the defects of his education,\nand formed the resolution, as far as possible, to regain lost ground.\nIn the last five years he had read much and seen something; he had many\nstray ideas in his head; any professor might have envied some of his\nacquirements, but at the same time he did not know much that every\nschoolboy would have learnt long ago. Lavretsky was aware of his\nlimitations; he was secretly conscious of being eccentric. The\nAnglomaniac had done his son an ill turn; his whimsical education had\nproduced its fruits. For long years he had submitted unquestioningly\nto his father; when at last he began to see through him, the evil was\nalready done, his habits were deeply-rooted. He could not get on with\npeople; at twenty-three years old, with an unquenchable thirst for love\nin his shy heart, he had never yet dared to look one woman in the\nface. With his intellect, clear and sound, but somewhat heavy, with his\ntendencies to obstinacy, contemplation, and indolence he ought from his\nearliest years to have been thrown into the stream of life, and he had\nbeen kept instead in artificial seclusion. And now the magic circle\nwas broken, but he continued to remain within it, prisoned and pent\nup within himself. It was ridiculous at his age to put on a student's\ndress, but he was not afraid of ridicule; his Spartan education had at\nleast the good effect of developing in him a contempt for the opinion of\nothers, and he put on, without embarrassment, the academical uniform.\nHe entered the section of physics and mathematics. Robust, rosy-cheeked,\nbearded, and taciturn, he produced a strange impression on his\ncompanions; they did not suspect that this austere man, who came so\npunctually to the lectures in a wide village sledge with a pair of\nhorses, was inwardly almost a child. He appeared to them to be a queer\nkind of pedant; they did not care for him, and made no overtures to\nhim, and he avoided them. During the first two years he spent in the\nuniversity, he only made acquaintance with one student, from whom he\ntook lessons in Latin. This student Mihalevitch by name, an enthusiast\nand a poet, who loved Lavretsky sincerely, by chance became the means of\nbringing about an important change in his destiny.\n\nOne day at the theatre--Motchalov was then at the height of his fame\nand Lavretsky did not miss a single performance--he saw in a box in the\nfront tier a young girl, and though no woman ever came near his grim\nfigure without setting his heart beating, it had never beaten so\nviolently before. The young girl sat motionless, leaning with her elbows\non the velvet of the box; the light of youth and life played in\nevery feature of her dark, oval, lovely face; subtle intelligence was\nexpressed in the splendid eyes which gazed softly and attentively from\nunder her fine brows, in the swift smile on her expressive lips, in the\nvery pose of her head, her hands, her neck. She was exquisitely dressed.\nBeside her sat a yellow and wrinkled woman of forty-five, with a\nlow neck, in a black headdress, with a toothless smile on her\nintently-preoccupied and empty face, and in the inner recesses of the\nbox was visible an elderly man in a wide frock-coat and high cravat,\nwith an expression of dull dignity and a kind of ingratiating\ndistrustfulness in his little eyes, with dyed moustache and whiskers, a\nlarge meaningless forehead and wrinkled cheeks, by every sign a retired\ngeneral. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off the girl who had made\nsuch an impression on him; suddenly the door of the box opened and\nMihalevitch went in. The appearance of this man, almost his one\nacquaintance in Moscow, in the society of the one girl who was absorbing\nhis whole attention, struck him as curious and significant. Continuing\nto gaze into the box, he observed that all the persons in it treated\nMihalevitch as an old friend. The performance on the stage ceased to\ninterest Lavretsky, even Motchalov, though he was that evening in his\n\"best form,\" did not produce the usual impression on him. At one very\npathetic part, Lavretsky involuntarily looked at his beauty: she\nwas bending forward, her cheeks glowing under the influence of his\npersistent gaze, her eyes, which were fixed on the stage, slowly\nturned and rested on him. All night he was! haunted by those eyes. The\nskillfully constructed barriers were broken down at last; he was in a\nshiver and a fever, and the next day he went to Mihalevitch. From him he\nlearnt that the name of the beauty was Varvara Pavlovna Korobyin; that\nthe old people sitting with her in the box were her father and mother;\nand that he, Mihalevitch, had become acquainted with them a year before,\nwhile he was staying at Count N.'s, in the position of a tutor, near\nMoscow. The enthusiast spoke in rapturous praise of Varvara Pavlovna.\n\"My dear fellow,\" he exclaimed with the impetuous ring in his voice\npeculiar to him, \"that girl is a marvelous creature, a genius, an artist\nin the true sense of the word, and she is very good too.\" Noticing from\nLavretsky's inquiries the impression Varvara Pavlovna had made on him,\nhe himself proposed to introduce him to her, adding that he was like one\nof the family with them; that the general was not at all proud, and\nthe mother was so stupid she could not say \"Bo\" to a goose. Lavretsky\nblushed, muttered something unintelligible, and ran away. For five whole\ndays he was struggling with his timidity; on the sixth day the young\nSpartan got into a new uniform and placed himself at Mihalevitch's\ndisposal. The latter being his own valet, confined himself to combing\nhis hair--and both betook themselves to the Korobyins.\n\n\n\nChapter XIII\n\n\nVarvara Pavlovna's father, Pavel Petrovitch Korobyin, a retired\ngeneral-major, had spent his whole time on duty in Petersburg. He had\nhad the reputation in his youth of a good dancer and driller. Through\npoverty, he had served as adjutant to two or three generals of no\ndistinction, and had married the daughter of one of them with a dowry\nof twenty-five thousand roubles. He mastered all the science of military\ndiscipline and manoeuvres to the minutest niceties, he went on in\nharness, till at last, after twenty-five years' service, he received\nthe rank of a general and the command of a regiment. Then he might have\nrelaxed his efforts and have quietly secured his pecuniary position.\nIndeed this was what he reckoned upon doing, but he managed things a\nlittle incautiously. He devised a new method of speculating with public\nfunds--the method seemed an excellent one in itself--but he neglected to\nbribe in the right place, and was consequently informed against, and a\nmore than unpleasant, a disgraceful scandal followed. The general got\nout of the affair somehow, but his career was ruined; he was advised\nto retire from active duty. For two years he lingered on in Petersburg,\nhoping to drop into some snug berth in the civil service, but no such\nsnug berth came in his way. His daughter had left school, his expenses\nwere increasing every day. Resigning himself to his fate, he decided to\nremove to Moscow for the sake of the greater cheapness of living, and\ntook a tiny low-pitched house in the Old Stables Road, with a coat of\narms seven feet long on the roof, and there began the life of a retired\ngeneral at Moscow on an income of 2750 roubles a year. Moscow is\na hospitable city, ready to welcome all stray comers, generals by\npreference. Pavel Petrovitch's heavy figure, which was not quite\ndevoid of martial dignity, however, soon began to be seen in the best\ndrawing-rooms in Moscow. His bald head with its tufts of dyed hair, and\nthe soiled ribbon of the Order of St. Anne which he wore over a cravat\nof the colour of a raven's wing, began to be familiar to all the pale\nand listless young men who hang morosely about the card-tables while\ndancing is going on. Pavel Petrovitch knew how to gain a footing in\nsociety; he spoke little, but from old habit, condescendingly--though,\nof course, not when he was talking to persons of a higher rank than his\nown. He played cards carefully; ate moderately at home, but consumed\nenough for six at parties. Of his wife there is scarcely anything to\nbe said. Her name was Kalliopa Karlovna. There was always a tear in her\nleft eye, on the strength of which Kalliopa Karlovna (she was, one\nmust add, of German extraction) considered herself a woman of great\nsensibility. She was always in a state of nervous agitation, seemed as\nthough she were ill-nourished, and wore a tight velvet dress, a cap, and\ntarnished hollow bracelets. The only daughter of Pavel Petrovitch and\nKalliopa Karlovna, Varvara Pavlovna, was only just seventeen when she\nleft the boarding-school, in which she had been reckoned, if not the\nprettiest, at least the cleverest pupil and the best musician, and where\nshe had taken a decoration. She was not yet nineteen, when Lavretsky saw\nher for the first time.\n\n\n\nChapter XIV\n\n\nThe young Spartan's legs shook under him when Mihalevitch conducted him\ninto the rather shabbily furnished drawing-room of the Korobyins, and\npresented him to them. But his overwhelming feeling of timidity soon\ndisappeared. In the general the good-nature innate in all Russians was\nintensified by that special kind of geniality which is peculiar to all\npeople who have done something disgraceful; the general's lady was as\nit were overlooked by every one; and as for Varvara Pavlovna, she was so\nself-possessed and easily cordial that every one at once felt at home\nin her presence; besides, about all her fascinating person, her smiling\neyes, her faultlessly sloping shoulders and rosy-tinged white hands, her\nlight and yet languid movements, the very sound of her voice, slow and\nsweet, there was an impalpable, subtle charm, like a faint perfume,\nvoluptuous, tender, soft, though still modest, something which is hard\nto translate into words, but which moved and kindled--and timidity!\nwas not the feeing it kindled. Lavretsky turned the conversation on\nthe theater, on the performance of the previous day; she at once began\nherself to discuss Motchalov, and did not confine herself to sighs and\ninterjections only, but uttered a few true observations full of feminine\ninsight in regard to his acting. Mihalevitch spoke about music; she sat\ndown without ceremony to the piano, and very correctly played some of\nChopin's mazurkas, which were then just coming into fashion. Dinner-time\ncame; Lavretsky would have gone away, but they made him stay: at dinner\nthe general regaled him with excellent Lafitte, which the general's\nlackey hurried off in a street-sledge to Dupre's to fetch. Late in\nthe evening Lavretsky returned home; for a long while he sat without\nundressing, covering his eyes with his hands in the stupefaction of\nenchantment. It seemed to him that now for the first time he understood\nwhat made life worth living; all his previous assumptions, all his\nplans, all that rubbish and nonsense had vanished into nothing! at once;\nall his soul was absorbed in one feeling, in one desire--in the desire\nof happiness, of possession, of love, the sweet love of a woman. From\nthat day he began to go often to the Korobyins. Six months later he\nspoke to Varvara Pavlovna, and offered her his hand. His offer was\naccepted; the general had long before, almost on the eve of Lavretsky's\nfirst visit, inquired of Mihalevitch how many serfs Lavretsky owned; and\nindeed Varvara Pavlovna, who through the whole time of the young man's\ncourtship, and even at the very moment of his declaration, had preserved\nher customary composure and clearness of mind--Varvara Pavlovna too was\nvery well aware that her suitor was a wealthy man; and Kalliopa Karlovna\nthought \"meine Tochter macht eine schone Partie,\" and bought herself a\nnew cap.\n\n\n\nChapter XV\n\n\nAnd so his offer was accepted, but on certain conditions. In the first\nplace, Lavretsky was at once to leave the university; who would\nbe married to a student, and what a strange idea too--how could a\nlandowner, a rich man, at twenty-six, take lessons and be at school?\nSecondly, Varvara Pavlovna took upon herself the labour of ordering\nand purchasing her trousseau and even choosing her present from the\nbridegroom. She had much practical sense, a great deal of taste, and a\nvery great love of comfort, together with a great faculty for obtaining\nit for herself. Lavretsky was especially struck by this faculty when,\nimmediately after their wedding, he traveled alone with his wife in\nthe comfortable carriage, bought by her, to Lavriky. How carefully\neverything with which he was surrounded had been thought of, devised\nand provided beforehand by Varvara Pavlovna! What charming knick-knacks\nappeared from various snug corners, what fascinating toilet-cases and\ncoffee-pots, and how delightfully Varvara Pavlovna herself made the\ncoffee in the morning! Lavretsky, however, was not at that time disposed\nto be observant; he was blissful, drunk with happiness; he gave himself\nup to it like a child. Indeed he was as innocent as a child, this\nyoung Hercules. Not in vain was the whole personality of his young wife\nbreathing with fascination; not in vain was her promise to the senses of\na mysterious luxury of untold bliss; her fulfillment was richer than her\npromise. When she reached Lavriky in the very height of the summer, she\nfound the house dark and dirty, the servants absurd and old-fashioned,\nbut she did not think it necessary even to hint at this to her husband.\nIf she had proposed to establish herself at Lavriky, she would have\nchanged everything in it, beginning of course with the house; but the\nidea of staying in that out-of-the-way corner of the steppes never\nentered her head for an instant; she lived as in a tent, good-temperedly\nputting up with all its inconveniences, and indulgently making merry\nover then. Marfa Timofyevna came to pay a visit to her former charge;\nVarvara Pavlovna liked her very much, but she did not like Varvara\nPavlovna. The new mistress did not get on with Glafira Petrovna either;\nshe would have left her in peace, but old Korobyin wanted to have a\nhand in the management of his son-in-law's affairs; to superintend the\nproperty of such a near relative, he said, was not beneath the dignity\nof even a general. One must add that Pavel Petrovitch would not have\nbeen above managing the property even of a total stranger. Varvara\nPavlovna conducted her attack very skillfully, without taking any\nstep in advance, apparently completely absorbed in the bliss of the\nhoneymoon, in the peaceful life of the country, in music and reading,\nshe gradually worked Glafira up to such a point that she rushed one\nmorning, like one possessed, into Lavretsky's study, and throwing a\nbunch of keys on the table, she declared that she was not equal to\nundertaking the management any longer, and did not want to stop in the\nplace. Lavretsky, having been suitably prepared beforehand, at once\nagreed to her departure. This Glafira Petrovna had not anticipated.\n\"Very well,\" she said, and her face darkened, \"I see that I am not\nwanted here! I know who is driving me out of the home of my fathers.\nOnly you mark my words, nephew; you will never make a home anywhere, you\nwill come to be a wanderer for ever. That is my last word to you.\" The\nsame day she went away to her own little property, and in a week General\nKorobyin was there, and with a pleasant melancholy in his looks and\nmovements he took the superintendence of the whole property into his\nhands.\n\nIn the month of September, Varvara Pavlovna carried her husband off to\nPetersburg. She passed two winters in Petersburg (for the summer\nshe went to stay at Tsarskoe Selo), in a splendid, light,\nartistically-furnished flat; they made many acquaintances among the\nmiddle and even higher ranks of society; went out and entertained a\ngreat deal, and gave the most charming dances and musical evenings.\nVarvara Pavlovna attracted guests as a fire attracts moths. Fedor\nIvanitch did not altogether like such a frivolous life. His wife advised\nhim to take some office under government; but from old association with\nhis father, and also through his own ideas, he was unwilling to\nenter government service, still he remained in Petersburg for Varvara\nPavlovna's pleasure. He soon discovered, however, that no one hindered\nhim from being alone; that it was not for nothing that he had the\nquietest and most comfortable study in all Petersburg; that his tender\nwife was even ready to aid him to! be alone; and from that time forth\nall went well. He again applied himself to his own, as he considered,\nunfinished education; he began again to read, and even began to learn\nEnglish. It was a strange sight to see his powerful, broad-shouldered\nfigure for ever bent over his writing table, his full-bearded ruddy face\nhalf buried in the pages of a dictionary or note-book. Every morning he\nset to work, then had a capital dinner (Varvara Pavlovna was unrivaled\nas a housekeeper), and in the evenings he entered an enchanted world of\nlight and perfume, peopled by gay young faces, and the centre of this\nworld was also the careful housekeeper, his wife. She rejoiced his heart\nby the birth of a son, but the poor child did not live long; it died in\nthe spring, and in the summer, by the advice of the doctors, Lavretsky\ntook his wife abroad to a watering-place. Distraction was essential for\nher after such a trouble, and her health, too, required a warm climate.\nThe summer and autumn they spent in Germany and Switzerland, and for\nthe winter, as one would naturally expect, they went to Paris. In Paris,\nVarvara Pavlovna bloomed like a rose, and was able to make herself a\nlittle nest as quickly and cleverly as in Petersburg. She found very\npretty apartments in one of the quiet but fashionable streets in Paris;\nshe embroidered her husband such a dressing-gown as he had never worn\nbefore; engaged a coquettish waiting maid, an excellent cook, and a\nsmart footman, procured a fascinating carriage, and an exquisite piano.\nBefore a week had passed, she crossed the street, wore her shawl,\nopened her parasol, and put on her gloves in a manner equal to the most\ntrue-born Parisian. And she soon drew round herself acquaintances.\nAt first, only Russians visited her, afterwards Frenchmen too,\nvery agreeable, polite, and unmarried, with excellent manners and\nwell-sounding names; they all talked a great deal and very fast, bowed\neasily, grimaced agreeably; their white teeth flashed under their rosy\nlips--and how they could smile! All! of them brought their friends, and\nla belle Madame de Lavretsky was soon known from Chausee d'Antin to Rue\nde Lille. In those days--it was in 1836--there had not yet arisen the\ntribe of journalists and reporters who now swarm on all sides like ants\nin an ant-hill; but even then there was seen in Varvara Pavlovna's salon\na certain M. Jules, a gentleman of unprepossessing exterior, with a\nscandalous reputation, insolent and mean, like all duelists and men\nwho have been beaten. Varvara Pavlovna felt a great aversion to this M.\nJules, but she received him because he wrote for various journals,\nand was incessantly mentioning her, calling her at one time Madame\nde L-----tski, at another Madame de -----, cette grande dame russe si\ndistinguee, qui demeure rue de P----- and telling all the world, that\nis, some hundreds of readers who had nothing to do with Madame\nde L-----tski, how charming and delightful this lady was; a\ntrue Frenchwoman in intelligence (une vraie francaise par\nl'esprit)--Frenchmen have no higher praise than this--what an\nextraordinary musician she was, and how marvelously she waltzed (Varvara\nPavlovna did in fact waltz so that she drew all her hearts to the hem\nof her light flying skirts)--in a word, he spread her fame through the\nworld, and, whatever one may say, that is pleasant. Mademoiselle Mars\nhad already left the stage, and Mademoiselle Rachel had not yet made her\nappearance; nevertheless, Varvara Pavlovna was assiduous in visiting the\ntheatres. She went into raptures over Italian music, yawned decorously\nat the Comedie Francaise, and wept at the acting of Madame Dorval in\nsome ultra romantic melodrama; and a great thing--Liszt played twice\nin her salon, and was so kind, so simple--it was charming! In such\nagreeable sensations was spent the winter, at the end of which Varvara\nPavlovna was even presented at court. Fedor Ivanitch, for his part,\nwas not bored, though his life, at times, weighed rather heavily on\nhim--because it was empty. He read the papers, listened to the lectures\nat the Sorbonne and the College de France, followed the debates in the\nChambers, and set to work on a translation of a well-known scientific\ntreatise on irrigation. \"I am not wasting my time,\" he thought, \"it is\nall of use; but next winter I must, without fail, return to Russia and\nset to work.\" It is difficult to say whether he had any clear idea\nof precisely what this work would consist of; and there is no telling\nwhether he would have succeeded in going to Russia in the winter; in the\nmeantime, he was going with his wife to Baden.. An unexpected incident\nbroke up all his plans.\n\n\n\nChapter XVI\n\n\nHappening to go one day in Varvara Pavlovna's absence into her\nboudoir, Lavretsky saw on the floor a carefully folded little paper.\nHe mechanically picked it up, unfolded it, and read the following note,\nwritten in French:\n\n\"Sweet angel Betsy (I never can make up my mind to call you Barbe or\nVarvara), I waited in vain for you at the corner of the boulevard; come\nto our little room at half-past one to-morrow. Your stout good-natured\nhusband (ton gros bonhomme de mari) is usually buried in his books at\nthat time; we will sing once more the song of your poet Pouskine (de\nbotre poete Pouskine) that you taught me: 'Old husband, cruel husband!'\nA thousand kisses on your little hands and feet. I await you.\n\n\"Ernest.\"\n\nLavretsky did not at once understand what he had read; he read it a\nsecond time, and his head began to swim, the ground began to sway under\nhis feet like the deck of a ship in a rolling sea. He began to cry out\nand gasp and weep all at the same instant.\n\nHe was utterly overwhelmed. He had so blindly believed in his wife; the\npossibility of deception, of treason, had never presented itself to his\nmind. This Ernest, his wife's lover, was a fair-haired pretty boy\nof three-and-twenty, with a little turned-up nose and refined little\nmoustaches, almost the most insignificant of all her acquaintances. A\nfew minutes passed, half an hour passed, Lavretsky still stood, crushing\nthe fatal note in his hands, and gazing senselessly at the floor; across\na kind of tempest of darkness pale shapes hovered about him; his\nheart was numb with anguish; he seemed to be falling, falling--and a\nbottomless abyss was opening at his feet. A familiar light rustle of a\nsilk dress roused him from his numbness; Varvara Pavlovna in her hat and\nshawl was returning in haste from her walk. Lavretsky trembled all over\nand rushed away; he felt that at that instant he was capable of tearing\nher to pieces, beating her to death, as a peasant might do, strangling\nher with his own hands. Varvara Pavlovna in amazement tried to stop him;\nhe could only whisper, \"Betsy,\"--and ran out of the house.\n\nLavretsky took a cab and ordered the man to drive him out of town. All\nthe rest of the day and the whole night he wandered about, constantly\nstopping short and wringing his hands, at one moment he was mad, and\nthe next he was ready to laugh, was even merry after a fashion. By the\nmorning he grew calm through exhaustion, and went into a wretched tavern\nin the outskirts, asked for a room and sat down on a chair before\nthe window. He was overtaken by a fit of convulsive yawning. He could\nscarcely stand upright, his whole body was worn out, and he did not even\nfeel fatigue, though fatigue began to do its work; he sat and gazed and\ncomprehended nothing; he did not understand what had happened to him,\nwhy he found himself alone, with his limbs stiff, with a taste\nof bitterness in his mouth, with a load on his heart, in an empty\nunfamiliar room; he did not understand what had impelled her, his Varya,\nto give herself to this Frenchman, and how, knowing herself unfaithful,\nshe could go on being just as calm, just as affectionate, as\nconfidential with him as before! \"I cannot understand it!\" his parched\nlips whispered. \"Who can guarantee now that even in Petersburg\"... And\nhe did not finish the question, and yawned again, shivering and shaking\nall over. Memories--bright and gloomy--fretted him alike; suddenly it\ncrossed his mind how some days before she had sat down to the piano and\nsung before him and Ernest the song, \"Old husband, cruel husband!\" He\nrecalled the expression of her face, the strange light in her eyes, and\nthe colour on her cheeks--and he got up from his seat, he would have\nliked to go to them, to tell them: \"You were wrong to play your tricks\non me; my great-grandfather used to hang the peasants up by their ribs,\nand my grandfather was himself a peasant,\" and to kill them both. Then\nall at once it seemed to him as if all that was happening was a dream,\nscarcely even a dream, but some kind of foolish joke; that he need\nonly shake himself and look round... He looked round, and like a! hawk\nclutching its captured prey, anguish gnawed deeper and deeper into his\nheart. To complete it all Lavretsky had been hoping in a few months to\nbe a father.... The past, the future, his whole life was poisoned. He\nwent back at last to Paris, stopped at an hotel and sent M. Ernest's\nnote to Varvara Pavlovna with the following letter:--\n\n\"The enclosed scrap of paper will explain everything to you. Let me\ntell you by the way, that I was surprised at you; you, who are always so\ncareful, to leave such valuable papers lying about.\" (Poor Lavretsky had\nspent hours preparing and gloating over this phrase.) \"I cannot see you\nagain; I imagine that you, too, would hardly desire an interview with\nme. I am assigning you 15,000 francs a year; I cannot give more. Send\nyour address to the office of the estate. Do what you please; live where\nyou please. I wish you happiness. No answer is needed.\"\n\nLavretsky wrote to his wife that he needed no answer... but he waited,\nhe thirsted for a reply, for an explanation of this incredible,\ninconceivable thing. Varvara Pavlovna wrote him the same day a\nlong letter in French. It put the finishing touch; his last doubts\nvanished,--and he began to feel ashamed that he had still had any doubt\nleft. Varvara Pavlovna did not attempt to defend herself; her only\ndesire was to see him, she besought him not to condemn her irrevocably.\nThe letter was cold and constrained, though here and there traces of\ntears were visible. Lavretsky smiled bitterly, and sent word by the\nmessenger that it was all right. Three days later he was no longer\nin Paris; but he did not go to Russia, but to Italy. He did not know\nhimself why he fixed upon Italy; he did not really care where he\nwent--so long as it was not home. He sent instructions to his steward\non the subject of his wife's allowance, and at the same time told him\nto take all control of his property out of General Korobyin's hands\nat once, without waiting for him to draw up an account, and to make\narrangements for his Excellency's departure from Lavriky; he could\npicture vividly the confusion, the vain airs of self-importance of the\ndispossessed general, and in the midst of all his sorrow, he felt a kind\nof spiteful satisfaction. At the same time he asked Glafira Petrovna by\nletter to return to Lavriky, and drew up a deed authorising her to take\npossession; Glafira Petrovna did not return to Lavriky, and printed\nin the newspapers that the deed was cancelled, which was perfectly\nunnecessary on her part. Lavretsky kept out of sight in a small Italian\ntown, but for a long time he could not help following his wife's\nmovements. From the newspapers he learned that she had gone from Paris\nto Baden as she had arranged; her name soon appeared in an article\nwritten by the same M. Jules. In this article there was a kind of\nsympathetic condolence apparent under the habitual playfulness; there\nwas a deep sense of disgust in the soul of Fedor Ivanitch as he read\nthis article. Afterwards he learned that a daughter had been born to\nhim; two months later he received a notification from his steward that\nVarvara Pavlovna had asked for the first quarter's allowance. Then worse\nand worse rumors began to reach him; at last, a tragic-comic story\nwas reported with acclamations in all the papers. His wife played an\nunenviable part in it. It was the finishing stroke; Varvara Pavlovna had\nbecome a \"notoriety.\"\n\nLavretsky ceased to follow her movements; but he could not quickly gain\nmastery over himself. Sometimes he was overcome by such a longing for\nhis wife that he would have given up everything, he thought, even,\nperhaps... could have forgiven her, only to hear her caressing voice\nagain, to feel again her hand in his. Time, however, did not pass in\nvain. He was not born to be a victim; his healthy nature reasserted its\nrights. Much became clear to him; even the blow that had fallen on him\nno longer seemed to him to have been quite unforeseen; he understood his\nwife,--we can only fully understand those who are near to us, when we\nare separated from them. He could take up his interests, could work\nagain, though with nothing like his former zeal; scepticism, half-formed\nalready by the experiences of his life, and by his education, took\ncomplete possession of his heart. He became indifferent to everything.\nFour years passed by, and he felt himself strong enough to return to his\ncountry, to meet his own people. Without stopping at Petersburg or at\nMoscow he came to the town of O-----, where we parted from him, and\nwhither we will now ask the indulgent reader to return with us.\n\n\n\nChapter XVII\n\n\nThe morning after the day we have described, at ten o'clock, Lavretsky\nwas mounting the steps of the Kalitins' house. He was met by Lisa coming\nout in her hat and gloves.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked her.\n\n\"To service. It is Sunday.\"\n\n\"Why do you go to church?\"\n\nLisa looked at him in silent amazement.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Lavretsky; \"I--I did not mean to say that;\nI have come to say good-bye to you, I am starting for my village in an\nhour.\"\n\n\"Is it far from here?\" asked Lisa.\n\n\"Twenty miles.\"\n\nLenotchka made her appearance in the doorway, escorted by a maid.\n\n\"Mind you don't forget us,\" observed Lisa, and went down the steps.\n\n\"And don't you forget me. And listen,\" he added, \"you are going to\nchurch; while you are there, pray for me, too.\"\n\nLisa stopped short and turned round to him: \"Certainly,\" she said,\nlooking him straight in the face, \"I will pray for you too. Come,\nLenotchka.\"\n\nIn the drawing-room Lavretsky found Marya Dmitrievna alone. She was\nredolent of eau de Cologne and mint. She had, as she said, a headache,\nand had passed a restless night. She received him with her usual languid\ngraciousness and gradually fell into conversation.\n\n\"Vladimir Nikolaitch is really a delightful young man, don't you think\nso?\" she asked him.\n\n\"What Vladimir Nikolaitch?\"\n\n\"Panshin to be sure, who was here yesterday. He took a tremendous fancy\nto you; I will tell you a secret, mon cher cousin, he is simply crazy\nabout my Lisa. Well, he is of good family, has a capital position in the\nservice, and a clever fellow, a kammer-yunker, and if it is God's will,\nI for my part, as a mother, shall be well pleased. My responsibility\nof course is immense; the happiness of children depends, no doubt, on\nparts; still I may say, up till now, for better or for worse I have done\neverything, I alone have been everywhere with them, that is to say,\nI have educated my children and taught them everything myself. Now,\nindeed, I have written for a French governess from Madame Boluce.\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna launched into a description of her cares and anxieties\nand maternal sentiments. Lavretsky listened in silence, turning his hat\nin his hands. His cold, weary glance embarrassed the gossiping lady.\n\n\"And do you like Lisa?\" she asked.\n\n\"Lisaveta Mihalovna is an excellent girl,\" replied Lavretsky, and he got\nup, took his leave, and went off to Marfa Timofyevna. Marya Dmitrievna\nlooked after him in high displeasure, and thought, \"What a dolt, a\nregular peasant! Well, now I understand why his wife could not remain\nfaithful to him.\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna was sitting in her room, surrounded by her little\ncourt. It consisted of five creatures almost equally near to her heart;\na big-cropped, learned bullfinch, which she had taken a fancy to because\nhe had lost his accomplishments of whistling and drawing water; a very\ntimid and peaceable little dog, Roska; an ill-tempered cat, Matross; a\ndark-faced, agile little girl nine years old, with big eyes and a sharp\nnose, call Shurotchka; and an elderly woman of fifty-five, in a white\ncap and a cinnamon-coloured abbreviated jacket, over a dark skirt,\nby name, Nastasya Karpovna Ogarkov. Shurotchka was an orphan of the\ntradesman class. Marfa Timofyevna had taken her to her heart like Roska,\nfrom compassion; she had found the little dog and the little girl too in\nthe street; both were thin and hungry, both were being drenched by the\nautumn rain; no one came in search of Roska, and Shurotchka was given\nup to Marfa Timofyevna with positive eagerness by her uncle, a drunken\nshoemaker, who did not get enough to eat himself, and did not feed his\nniece, but beat her over the head with his last. With Nastasya Karpovna,\nMarfa Timofyevna had made acquaintance on a pilgrimage at a monastery;\nshe had gone up to her at the church (Marfa Timofyevna took a fancy to\nher because in her own words she said her prayers so prettily) and had\naddressed her and invited her to a cup of tea. From that day she never\nparted from her.\n\nNastasya Karpovna was a woman of the most cheerful and gentle\ndisposition, a widow without children, of a poor noble family; she had a\nround grey head, soft white hands, a soft face with large mild\nfeatures, and a rather absurd turned-up nose; she stood in awe of Marfa\nTimofyevna, and the latter was very fond of her, though she laughed at\nher susceptibility. She had a soft place in her heart for every young\nman, and could not help blushing like a girl at the most innocent joke.\nHer whole fortune consisted of only 1200 roubles; she lived at Marfa\nTimofyevna's expense, but on an equal footing with her: Marfa Timofyevna\nwould not have put up with any servility.\n\n\"Ah! Fedya,\" she began, directly she saw him, \"last night you did not\nsee my family, you must admire them, we are all here together for tea;\nthis is our second, holiday tea. You can make friends with them all;\nonly Shurotchka won't let you, and the cat will scratch. Are you\nstarting to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lavretsky sat down on a low seat, \"I have just said good-bye to\nMarya Dmitrievna. I saw Lisaveta Mihalovna too.\"\n\n\"Call her Lisa, my dear fellow. Mihalovna indeed to you! But sit still,\nor you will break Shurotchka's little chair.\"\n\n\"She has gone to church,\" continued Lavretsky. \"Is she religious?\"\n\n\"Yes, Fedya, very much so. More than you and I, Fedya.\"\n\n\"Aren't you religious then?\" lisped Nastasya Karpovna. \"To-day, you have\nnot been to the early service, but you are going to the late.\"\n\n\"No, not at all; you will go alone; I have grown too lazy, my dear,\"\nrelied Marfa Timofyevna. \"Already I am indulging myself with tea.\" She\naddressed Nastasya Karpovna in the singular, though she treated her as\nan equal. She was not a Pestov for nothing: three Pestovs had been on\nthe death-list of Ivan the Terrible, Marfa Timofyevna was well aware of\nthe fact.\n\n\"Tell me please,\" began Lavretsky again, \"Marya Dmitrievna has just been\ntalking to me about this--what's his name? Panshin. What sort of a man\nis he?\"\n\n\"What a chatterbox she is, Lord save us!\" muttered Marfa Timofyevna.\n\"She told you, I suppose, as a secret that he has turned up as a suitor.\nShe might have whispered it to her priest's son; no, he's not good\nenough for her, it seems. And so far there's nothing to tell, thank God,\nbut already she's gossiping about it.\"\n\n\"Why thank God?\" asked Lavretsky.\n\n\"Because I don't like the fine young gentleman; and so what is there to\nbe glad of in it?\"\n\n\"You don't like him?\"\n\n\"No, he can't fascinate every one. He must be satisfied with Nastasya\nKarpovna's being in love with him.\"\n\nThe poor widow was utterly dismayed.\n\n\"How can you, Marfa Timofyevna? you've no conscience!\" she cried, and a\ncrimson flush instantly overspread her face and neck.\n\n\"And he knows, to be sure, the rogue,\" Marfa Timofyevna interrupted her,\n\"he knows how to captivate her; he made her a present of a snuff-box.\nFedya, ask her for a pinch of snuff; you will see what a splendid\nsnuff-box it is; on the lid a hussar on horseback. You'd better not try\nto defend yourself, my dear.\"\n\nNastasya Karpovna could only fling up her hands.\n\n\"Well, but Lisa,\" inquired Lavretsky, \"is she indifferent to him?\"\n\n\"She seems to like him, but there, God knows! The heart of another, you\nknow, is a dark forest, and a girl's more than any. Shurotchka's heart,\nfor instance--I defy you to understand it! What makes her hide herself\nand not come out ever since you came in?\"\n\nShurotchka choked with suppressed laughter and skipped out of the room.\nLavretsky rose from his place.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in an uncertain voice, \"there is no deciphering a girl's\nheart.\"\n\nHe began to say good-bye.\n\n\"Well, shall we see you again soon?\" inquired Marfa Timofyevna.\n\n\"Very likely, aunt: it's not far off, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure you are going to Vassilyevskoe. You don't care to stay\nat Lavriky: well, that's your own affair, only mind you go and say a\nprayer at our mother's grave, and our grandmother's too while you are\nthere. Out there in foreign parts you have picked up all kinds of ideas,\nbut who knows? Perhaps even in their graves they will feel that you have\ncome to them. And, Fedya, don't forget to have a service sung too for\nGlafira Petrovna; here's a silver rouble for you. Take it, take it,\nI want to pay for a service for her. I had no love for her in her\nlifetime, but all the same there's no denying she was a girl of\ncharacter. She was a clever creature; and a good friend to you. And now\ngo and God be with you, before I weary you.\"\n\nAnd Marfa Timofyevna embraced her nephew.\n\n\"And Lisa's not going to marry Panshin; don't you trouble yourself;\nthat's not the sort of husband she deserves.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not troubling myself,\" answered Lavretsky, and went away.\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\n\nFour days later, he set off for home. His coach rolled quickly along\nthe soft cross-road. There had been no rain for a fortnight; a fine milk\nmist was diffused in the air and hung over the distant woods; a smell of\nburning came from it. A multitude of darkish clouds with blurred edges\nwere creeping across the pale blue sky; a fairly strong breeze blew a\ndry and steady gale, without dispelling the heat. Leaning back with\nhis head on the cushion and his arms crossed on his breast, Lavretsky\nwatched the furrowed fields unfolding like a fan before him, the willow\nbushes as they slowly came into sight, and the dull ravens and rooks,\nwho looked sidelong with stupid suspicion at the approaching carriage,\nthe long ditches, overgrown with mugwort, wormwood, and mountain ash;\nand as he watched the fresh fertile wilderness and solitude of this\nsteppe country, the greenness, the long slopes, and valleys with stunted\noak bushes, the grey villages, and scant birch trees,--the whole Russian\nlandscape, so long unseen by him, stirred emotion at once pleasant,\nsweet and almost painful in his heart, and he felt weighed down by\na kind of pleasant oppression. Slowly his thoughts wandered; their\noutlines were as vague and indistinct as the outlines of the clouds\nwhich seemed to be wandering at random overhead. He remembered his\nchildhood, his mother; he remembered her death, how they had carried\nhim in to her, and how, clasping his head to her bosom, she had begun\nto wail over him, then had glanced at Glafira Petrovna--and checked\nherself. He remembered his father, at first vigorous, discontented with\neverything, with strident voice; and later, blind, tearful, with unkempt\ngrey beard; he remembered how one day after drinking a glass too much at\ndinner, and spilling the gravy over his napkin, he began to relate his\nconquests, growing red in the face, and winking with his sightless eyes;\nhe remember Varvara Pavlovna,--and involuntarily shuddered, as a man\nshudders from a sudden internal pain, and shook his head. Then his!\nthoughts came to a stop at Lisa.\n\n\"There,\" he thought, \"Is a new creature, only just entering on life.\nA nice girl, what will become of her? She is good-looking too. A\npale, fresh face, mouth and eyes so serious, and an honest innocent\nexpression. It is a pity she seems a little enthusiastic. A good figure,\nand she moves so lightly, and a soft voice. I like the way she stops\nsuddenly, listens attentively, without a smile, then grows thoughtful\nand shakes back her hair. I fancy, too, that Panshin is not good enough\nfor her. What's amiss with him, though? And besides, what business have\nI to wonder about it? She will go along the same road as all the rest. I\nhad better go to sleep.\" And Lavretsky closed his eyes.\n\nHe could not sleep, but he sank into the drowsy numbness of a journey.\nImages of the past rose slowly as before, floated in his soul, mixed and\ntangled up with other fancies. Lavretsky, for some unknown reason, began\nto think about Robert Peel,... about French history--of how he would\ngain a battle, if he were a general; he fancied the shots and the cries\n.... His head slipped on one side, he opened his eyes. The same fields,\nthe same steppe scenery; the polished shoes of the trace-horses flashed\nalternately through the driving dust; the coachman's shirt, yellow\nwith red gussets, was puffed out by the wind.... \"A nice home-coming!\"\nglanced through Lavretsky's brain; and he cried, \"Get on!\" wrapped\nhimself in his cloak and pressed close into the cushion. The carriage\njolted; Lavretsky sat up and opened his eyes wide. On the slope before\nhim stretched a small hamlet; a little to the right could be seen an\nancient manor house of small size, with closed shutters! and a winding\nflight of steps; nettles, green and thick as hemp, grew over the wide\ncourtyard from the very gates; in it stood a storehouse built of oak,\nstill strong. This was Vassilyevskoe.\n\nThe coachman drove to the gates and drew up; Lavretsky's groom stood\nup on the box and as though in preparation for jumping down, shouted,\n\"Hey!\" There was a sleepy, muffled sound of barking, but not even a dog\nmade its appearance; the groom again made ready for a jump, and again\nshouted \"Hey!\" The feeble barking was repeated, and an instant after\na man from some unseen quarter ran into the courtyard, dressed in a\nnankeen coat, his head as white as snow; he stared at the coach, shading\nhis eyes from the sun; all at once he slapped his thighs with both\nhands, ran to and fro a little, then rushed to open the gates. The coach\ndrove into the yard, crushing the nettles with the wheels, and drew up\nat the steps. The white-headed man, who seemed very alert, was already\nstanding on the bottom step, his legs bent and wide apart, he unfastened\nthe apron of the carriage, holding back the strap with a jerk and aiding\nhis master to alight; he kissed his hand.\n\n\"How do you do, how do you do, brother?\" began Lavretsky. \"Your name's\nAnton, I think? You are still alive, then?\" The old man bowed without\nspeaking, and ran off for the keys. While he went, the coachman sat\nmotionless, sitting sideways and staring at the closed door, but\nLavretsky's groom stood as he had leaped down in a picturesque pose with\none arm thrown back on the box. The old man brought the keys, and, quite\nneedlessly, twisting about like a snake, with his elbows raised high, he\nopened the door, stood on one side, and again bowed to the earth.\n\n\"So here I am at home, here I am back again,\" thought Lavretsky, as he\nwalked into the diminutive passage, while one after another the shutters\nwere being opened with much creaking and knocking, and the light of day\npoured into the deserted rooms.\n\n\n\nChapter XIX\n\n\nThe small manor-house to which Lavretsky had come and in which two years\nbefore Glafira Petrovna had breathed her last, had been built in the\npreceding century of solid pine-wood; it looked ancient, but it was\nstill strong enough to stand another fifty years or more. Lavretsky made\nthe tour of all the rooms, and to the great discomfiture of the aged\nlanguid flies, settled under the lintels and covered with white dust,\nhe ordered the windows to be opened everywhere; they had not been opened\never since the death of Glafira Petrovna. Everything in the house had\nremained as it was; the thin-legged white miniature couches in the\ndrawing-room, covered with glossy grey stuff, threadbare and rickety,\nvividly suggested the days of Catherine; in the drawing-room, too, stood\nthe mistress's favourite arm-chair, with high straight back, against\nwhich she never leaned even in her old age. On the principal wall hung\na very old portrait of Fedor's great-grandfather, Andrey Lavretsky;\nthe dark yellow face was scarcely distinguishable from the warped\nand blackened background; the small cruel eyes looked grimly out from\nbeneath the eyelids, which dropped as if they were swollen; his black\nunpowdered hair rose bristling above his heavy indented brow. In the\ncorner of the portrait hung a wreath of dusty immortelles. \"Glafira\nPetrovna herself was pleased to make it,\" Anton announced. In the\nbedroom stood a narrow bedstead, under a canopy of old-fashioned and\nvery good striped material; a heap of faded cushions and a thin quilted\ncounterpane lay on the bed, and at the head hung a picture of the\nPresentation in the Temple of the Holy Mother of God; it was the very\npicture which the old maid, dying alone and forgotten by every one, had\nfor the last time pressed to her chilling lips. A little toilet table\nof inlaid wood, with brass fittings and a warped looking-glass in a\ntarnished frame stood in the window. Next to the bedroom was the little\nikon room with bare walls and a heavy case of holy images in the corner;\non the floor lay a threadbare rug spotted with wax; Glafira Petrovna\nused to pray bowing to the ground upon it. Anton went away with\nLavretsky's groom to unlock the stable and coach-house; to replace him\nappeared an old woman of about the same age, with a handkerchief tied\nround to her very eyebrows; her head shook, and her eyes were dim, but\nthey expressed zeal, the habit of years of submissive service, and at\nthe same time a kind of respectful commiseration. She kissed Lavretsky's\nhand and stood still in the doorway awaiting his orders. He positively\ncould not recollect her name and did not even remember whether he had\never seen her. Her name, it appeared, was Apraxya; forty years before,\nGlafira Petrovna had put her out of the master's house and ordered that\nshe should be a poultry woman. She said little, however; she seemed\nto have lost her senses from old age, and could only gaze at him\nobsequiously. Besides these two old creatures and three pot-bellied\nchildren in long smocks, Anton's great-grandchildren, there was also\nliving in the manor-house a one-armed peasant, who was exempted from\nservitude; he muttered like a woodcock and was of no use for anything.\nNot much more useful was the decrepit dog who had saluted Lavretsky's\nreturn by its barking; he had been for ten years fastened up by a heavy\nchain, purchased at Glafira Petrovna's command, and was scarcely able to\nmove and drag the weight of it. Having looked over the house, Lavretsky\nwent into the garden and was very much pleased with it. It was all\novergrown with high grass, and burdock, and gooseberry and raspberry\nbushes, but there was plenty of shade, and many old lime-trees, which\nwere remarkable for their immense size and the peculiar growth of their\nbranches; they had been planted too close and at some time or other--a\nhundred years before--they had been lopped. At the end of the garden\nwas a small clear pool bordered with high reddish rushes. The traces of\nhuman life very quickly! pass away; Glafira Petrovna's estate had not\nhad time to become quite wild, but already it seemed plunged in that\nquiet slumber in which everything reposes on earth where there is not\nthe infection of man's restlessness. Fedor Ivanitch walked also through\nthe village; the peasant-women stared at him from the doorways of their\nhuts, their cheeks resting on their hands; the peasants saluted him from\na distance, the children ran out, and the dogs barked indifferently. At\nlast he began to feel hungry; but he did not expect his servants and his\ncook till the evening; the waggons of provisions from Lavriky had not\ncome yet, and he had to have recourse to Anton. Anton arranged matters\nat once; he caught, killed, and plucked an old hen; Apraxya gave it a\nlong rubbing and cleaning, and washed it like linen before putting it\ninto the stew-pan; when, at last, it was cooked Anton laid the cloth\nand set the table, placing beside the knife and fork a three-legged\nsalt-cellar of tarnished plate and a cut decanter with a round glass\nstopper and a narrow neck; then he announced to Lavretsky in a sing-song\nvoice that the meal was ready, and took his stand behind his chair,\nwith a napkin twisted round his right fights, and diffusing about him\na peculiar strong ancient odour, like the scent of a cypress-tree.\nLavretsky tried the soup, and took out the hen; its skin was all covered\nwith large blisters; a tough tendon ran up each leg; the meat had a\nflavour of wood and soda. When he had finished dinner, Lavretsky said\nthat he would drink a cup of tea, if--\"I will bring it this minute,\" the\nold man interrupted. And he kept his word. A pinch of tea was hunted\nup, twisted in a screw of red paper; a small but very fiery and\nloudly-hissing samovar was found, and sugar too in small lumps, which\nlooked as if they were thawing. Lavretsky drank tea out of a large cup;\nhe remembered this cup from childhood; there were playing-cards depicted\nupon it, only visitors used to drink out of it--and here was he drinking\nout if like a visitor. In the evening his servants came; Lavretsky did\nnot care to sleep in his aunt's bed; he directed them put him up a bed\nin the dining-room. After extinguishing his candle he stared for a long\ntime about him and feel into cheerless reflection; he experienced that\nfeeling which every man knows whose lot it is to pass the night in a\nplace long uninhabited; it seemed to him that the darkness surrounding\nhim on all sides could not be accustomed to the new inhabitant, the\nvery walls of the house seemed amazed. At last he sighed, drew up the\ncounterpane round him and fell asleep. Anton remained up after all the\nrest of the household; he was whispering a long while with Apraxya, he\nsighed in an undertone, and twice he crossed himself; they had\nneither of them expected that their master would settle among them at\nVassilyevskoe when he had not far off such a splendid estate with such\na capitally built house; they did not suspect that the very house was\nhateful to Lavretsky; it stirred painful memories within him. Having\ngossiped to his heart's content, Anton took a stick and struck the night\nwatchman's board, which had hung silent for so many years, and laid down\nto sleep in the courtyard with no covering on his white head. The May\nnight was mild and soft, and the old man slept sweetly.\n\n\n\nChapter XX\n\n\nThe next day Lavretsky got up rather early, had a talk with the village\nbailiff, visited the threshing-floor, ordered the chain to be taken off\nthe yard dog, who only barked a little but did not even come out of his\nkennel, and returning home, sank into a kind of peaceful torpor, which\nhe did not shake off the whole day.\n\n\"Here I am at the very bottom of the river,\" he said to himself more\nthan once. He sat at the window without stirring, and, as it were,\nlistened to the current of the quiet life surrounding him, to the few\nsounds of the country solitude. Something from behind the nettles chirps\nwith a shrill, shrill little note; a gnat seems to answer it. Now it\nhas ceased, but still the gnat keeps up its sharp whirr; across the\npleasant, persistent, fretful buzz of the flies sounds the hum of a big\nbee, constantly knocking its head against the ceiling; a cock crows in\nthe street, hoarsely prolonging the last note; there is the rattle of\na cart; in the village a gate is creaking. Then the jarring voice of a\npeasant woman, \"What?\" \"Hey, you are my little sweetheart,\" cries Anton\nto the little two-year-old girl he is dandling in his arms. \"Fetch the\nkvas,\" repeats the same woman's voice, and all at once there follows\na deathly silence; nothing rattles, nothing is moving; the wind is not\nstirring a leaf; without a sound the swallows fly one after another over\nthe earth, and sadness weights on the heart from their noiseless flight.\n\"Here I am at the very bottom of the river,\" thought Lavretsky again.\n\"And always, at all times life here is quiet, unhasting,\" he thought;\n\"whoever comes within its circle must submit; here there is nothing to\nagitate, nothing to harass; one can only get on here by making one's\nway slowly, as the ploughman cuts the furrow with his plough. And what\nvigour, what health abound in this inactive place! Here under the window\nthe sturdy burdock creeps out of the thick grass; above it the lovage\ntrails its juicy stalks and the Virgin's tears fling still higher their\npink tendrils; and yonder further in the fields is the silky rye, and\nthe oats are already in ear, and every leaf on every tree, every grass\non its stalk is spread to its fullest width. In the love of a woman my\nbest years have gone by,\" Lavretsky went on thinking, \"let me be sobered\nby the sameness of life here, let me be soothed and made ready, so that\nI may learn to do my duty without haste.\" And again he fell to listening\nto the silence, expecting nothing--and at the same time constantly\nexpecting something; the silence enfolded him on all sides, the sun\nmoved calmly in the peaceful blue sky, and the clouds sailed calmly\nacross it; they seemed to know why and whither they were sailing. At\nthis same time in other places on the earth there is the seething, the\nbustle, the clash of life; life here slipped by noiseless, as water over\nmarshy grass; and even till evening Lavretsky could not tear himself\nfrom the contemplation of this life as it passed and glided by; sorrow\nfor the past was melting in his soul like snow in spring, and strange to\nsay, never had the feeling of home been so deep and strong within him.\n\n\n\nChapter XXI\n\n\nIn the course of a fortnight, Fedor Ivanitch had brought Glafira\nPetrovna's little house into order and had cleared the court-yard and\nthe garden. From Lavriky comfortable furniture was sent him; from the\ntown, wine, books, and papers; horses made their appearance in the\nstable; in brief Fedor Ivanitch provided himself with everything\nnecessary and began to live--not precisely after the manner of a country\nlandowner, nor precisely after the manner of a hermit. His days\npassed monotonously; but he was not bored though he saw no one; he set\ndiligently and attentively to work at farming his estate, rode about the\nneighbourhood and did some reading. He read little, however; he found it\npleasanter to listen to the tales of old Anton. Lavretsky usually sat at\nthe window with a pipe and a cup of cold tea. Anton stood at the door,\nhis hands crossed behind him, and began upon his slow, deliberate\nstories of old times, of those fabulous times when oats and rye were not\nsold by measure, but in great sacks, at two or three farthings a sack;\nwhen there were impassable forests, virgin steppes stretching on every\nside, even close to the town. \"And now,\" complained the old man, whose\neightieth year had passed, \"there has been so much clearing, so much\nploughing everywhere, there's nowhere you may drive now.\" Anton used to\ntell many stories, too, of his mistress, Glafira Petrovna; how prudent\nand saving she was; how a certain gentleman, a young neighbour, had\npaid her court, and used to ride over to see her, and how she was even\npleased to put on her best cap, with ribbons of salmon colour, and her\nyellow gown of tru-tru levantine for him; but how, later on, she had\nbeen angry with the gentleman neighbour for his unseemly inquiry, \"What,\nmadam, pray, might be your fortune?\" and had bade them refuse him the\nhouse; and how it was then that she had given directions that, after her\ndecease, everything to the last rag should pass to Fedor Ivanitch.\nAnd, indeed, Lavretsky found all his aunt's household goods intact, not\nexcepting the best cap with ribbons of salmon colour, and the yellow\ngown of tru-tru levantine. Of old papers and interesting documents,\nupon which Lavretsky had reckoned, there seemed no trace, except one old\nbook, in which his grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, had inscribed in\none place, \"Celebration in the city of Saint Petersburg of the peace,\nconcluded with the Turkish empire by his Excellency Prince Alexander\nAlexandrovitch Prozorovsky;\" in another place a recipe for a pectoral\ndecoction with the comment, \"This recipe was given to the general's\nlady, Prascovya Federovna Soltikov, by the chief priest of the Church of\nthe Life-giving Trinity, Fedor Avksentyevitch:\" in another, a piece of\npolitical news of this kind: \"Somewhat less talk of the French tigers;\"\nand next this entry: \"In the Moscow Gazette an announcement of the death\nof Mr. Senior-Major Mihal Petrovitch Kolitchev. Is not this the son of\nPiotr Vassilyevitch Kolitchev? Lavretsky found also some old calendars\nand dream-books, and the mysterious work of Ambodik; many were the\nmemories stirred by the well-known; but long-forgotten Symbols and\nEmblems. In Glafira Petrovna's little dressing-table, Lavretsky found a\nsmall packet, tied up with black ribbon, sealed with black sealing wax,\nand thrust away in the very farthest corner of the drawer. In the parcel\nthere lay face to face a portrait, in pastel, of his father in his\nyouth, with effeminate curls straying over his brow, with almond-shaped\nlanguid eyes and parted lips, and a portrait, almost effaced, of a pale\nwoman in a white dress with a white rose in her hand--his mother. Of\nherself, Glafira Petrovna had never allowed a portrait to be taken. \"I,\nmyself, little father, Fedor Ivanitch,\" Anton used to tell Lavretsky,\n\"though I did not then live in the master's house, still I can remember\nyour great-grandfather, Andrey Afanasyevitch, seeing that I had come\nto my eighteenth year when he died. Once I met him in the garden and my\nknees! were knocking with fright indeed; however, he did nothing, only\nasked me my name, and sent me to his room for his pocket-handkerchief.\nHe was a gentleman--how shall I tell you--he didn't look on any one as\nbetter than himself. For your great-grandfather had, I do assure you, a\nmagic amulet; a monk from Mount Athos made him a present of this amulet.\nAnd he told him, this monk did, \"It's for your kindness, Boyar, I give\nyou this; wear it, and you need not fear judgment.\" Well, but there,\nlittle father, we know what those times were like; what the master\nfancied doing, that he did. Sometimes, if even some gentleman saw fit to\ncross him in anything, he would just stare at him and say, \"You swim\nin shallow water;\" that was his favourite saying. And he lived, your\ngreat-grandfather of blessed memory, in a small log-house; and what\ngoods he left behind him, what silver, and stores of all kinds! All\nthe storehouses were full and overflowing. He was a manager. That very\ndecanter, that you were pleased to admire, was his; he used to drink\nbrandy out of it. But there was your grandfather, Piotr Andreitch, built\nhimself a palace of stone, but he never grew rich; everything with him\nwent badly, and he lived worse than his father by far, and he got no\npleasure from it for himself, but spent all his money, and now there is\nnothing to remember him by--not a silver spoon has come down from him,\nand we have Glafira Petrovna's management to thank for all that is\nsaved.\n\n\"But is it true,\" Lavretsky interrupted him, \"they called her the old\nwitch?\"\n\n\"What sort of people called her so, I should like to know!\" replied\nAnton with an air of displeasure.\n\n\"And little father,\" the old man one day found courage to ask, \"what\nabout our mistress, where is she pleased to fix her residence?\"\n\n\"I am separated from my wife,\" Lavretsky answered with an effort,\n\"please do not ask questions about her.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the old man mournfully.\n\nAfter three weeks had passed by, Lavretsky rode into O----- to the\nKalitins, and spent an evening with them. Lemm was there; Lavretsky\ntook a great liking to him. Although thanks to his father, he played\nno instrument, he was passionately fond of music, real classical music.\nPanshin was not at the Kalitins' that evening. The governor had sent him\noff to some place out of the town. Lisa played alone and very correct;\nLemm woke up, got excited, twisted a piece of paper into a roll, and\nconducted. Marya Dmitrievna laughed at first, as she looked at him,\nlater on she went off to bed; in her own words, Beethoven was too\nagitating for her nerves. At midnight Lavretsky accompanied Lemm to his\nlodging and stopped there with him till three o'clock in the morning.\nLemm talked a great deal; his bent figure grew erect, his eyes opened\nwide and flashed fire; his hair even stood up on his forehead. It was\nso long since any one had shown him any sympathy, and Lavretsky was\nobviously interested in him, he was plying him with sympathetic and\nattentive questions. This touched the old man; he ended by showing the\nvisitor his music, played and even sang in a faded voice some extracts\nfrom his works, among others the whole of Schiller's ballad, Fridolin,\nset by him to music. Lavretsky admired it, made him repeat some\npassages, and at parting, invited him to stay a few days with him. Lemm,\nas he accompanied him as far as the street, agreed at once, and warmly\npressed his hand; but when he was left standing alone in the fresh, damp\nair, in the just dawning sunrise, he looked round him, shuddered, shrank\ninto himself, and crept up to his little room, with a guilty air. \"Ich\nbin wohl nicht klug\" (I must be out of my senses), he muttered, as he\nlay down in his hard short bed. He tried to say that he was ill, a few\ndays later, when Lavretsky drove over to fetch him in an open carriage;\nbut Fedor Ivanitch went up into his room and managed to persuade him.\nWhat produced the most powerful effect upon Lemm was the circumstance\nthat Lavretsky had ordered a piano from town to be sent into the country\nexpressly for him.\n\nThey set off together to the Kalitins' and spent the evening with them,\nbut not so pleasantly as on the last occasion. Panshin was there, he\ntalked a great deal about his expedition, and very amusingly mimicked\nand described the country gentry he had seen; Lavretsky laughed,\nbut Lemm would not come out of his corner, and sat silent, slightly\ntremulous all over like a spider, looking dull and sullen, and he only\nrevived when Lavretsky began to take leave. Even when he was sitting in\nthe carriage, the old man was still shy and constrained; but the warm\nsoft air, the light breeze, and the light shadows, the scent of the\ngrass and the birch-buds, the peaceful light of the starlit, moonless\nnight, the pleasant tramp and snort of the horses--all the witchery\nof the roadside, the spring and the night, sank into the poor German's\nsoul, and he was himself the first to begin a conversation with\nLavretsky.\n\n\n\nChapter XXII\n\n\nHe began talking about music, about Lisa, then of music again. He seemed\nto enunciate his words more slowly when he spoke of Lisa. Lavretsky\nturned the conversation on his compositions, and half in jest, offered\nto write him a libretto.\n\n\"H'm, a libretto!\" replied Lemm; \"no, that is not in my line; I have not\nnow the liveliness, the play of the imagination, which is needed for an\nopera; I have lost too much of my power... But if I were still able to\ndo something,--I should be content with a song; of course, I should like\nto have beautiful words...\"\n\nHe ceased speaking, and sat a long while motionless, his eyes lifted to\nthe heavens.\n\n\"For instance,\" he said at last, \"something in this way: 'Ye stars, ye\npure stars!'\"\n\nLavretsky turned his face slightly towards him and began to look at him.\n\n\"'Ye stars, pure stars,'\" repeated Lemm... \"'You look down upon the\nrighteous and guilty alike.. but only the pure in heart,'--or something\nof that kind--'comprehend you'--that is, no--'love you.' But I am not\na poet. I'm not equal to it! Something for that kind, though, something\nlofty.\"\n\nLemm pushed his hat on to the back of his head; in the dim twilight of\nthe clear night his face looked paler and younger.\n\n\"'And you too,'\" he continued, his voice gradually sinking, \"'ye know\nwho loves, who can love, because, pure ones, ye alone can comfort'...\nNo, that's not it at all! I am not a poet,\" he said, \"but something of\nthat sort.\"\n\n\"I am sorry I am not a poet,\" observed Lavretsky.\n\n\"Vain dreams!\" replied Lemm, and he buried himself in the corner of\nthe carriage. He closed his eyes as though he were disposing himself to\nsleep.\n\nA few instants passed... Lavretsky listened... \"'Stars, pure stars,\nlove,'\" muttered the old man.\n\n\"Love,\" Lavretsky repeated to himself. He sank into thought--and his\nheart grew heavy.\n\n\"That is beautiful music you have set to Fridolin, Christopher\nFedoritch,\" he said aloud, \"but what do you suppose, did that Fridolin\ndo, after the Count had presented him to his wife... became her lover,\neh?\"\n\n\"You think so,\" replied Lemm, \"probably because experience,\"--he stopped\nsuddenly and turned away in confusion. Lavretsky laughed constrainedly,\nand also turned away and began gazing at the road.\n\nThe stars had begun to grow paler and the sky had turned grey when the\ncarriage drove up to the steps of the little house in Vassilyevskoe.\nLavretsky conducted his guest to the room prepared for him, returned to\nhis study and sat down before the window. In the garden a nightingale\nwas singing its last song before dawn, Lavretsky remember that a\nnightingale had sung in the garden at the Kalitins'; he remembered, too,\nthe soft stir in Lisa's eyes, as at its first notes, they turned towards\nthe dark window. He began to think of her, and his heart was calm again.\n\"Pure maiden,\" he murmured half-aloud: \"pure stars,\" he added with a\nsmile, and went peacefully to bed.\n\nBut Lemm sat a long while on his bed, a music-book on his knees. He felt\nas though sweet, unheard melody was haunting him; already he was all\naglow and astir, already he felt the languor and sweetness of its\npresence.. but he could not reach it.\n\n\"Neither poet nor musician!\" he muttered at last... And his tired head\nsank wearily on to the pillows.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII\n\n\nThe next morning the master of the house and his guest drank tea in the\ngarden under an old time-tree.\n\n\"Master!\" said Lavretsky among other things, \"you will soon have to\ncompose a triumphal cantata.\"\n\n\"On what occasion?\"\n\n\"For the nuptials of Mr. Panshin and Lisa. Did you notice what attention\nhe paid her yesterday? It seems as though things were in a fair way with\nthem already.\"\n\n\"That will never be!\" cried Lemm.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it is impossible. Though, indeed,\" he added after a short\npause, \"everything is possible in this world. Especially here among you\nin Russia.\"\n\n\"We will leave Russia out of the question for a time; but what do you\nfind amiss in this match?\"\n\n\"Everything is amiss, everything. Lisaveta Mihalovna is a girl of high\nprinciples, serious, of lofty feelings, and he... he is a dilettante, in\na word.\"\n\n\"But suppose she loves him\"\n\nLemm got up from the bench.\n\n\"No, she does not love him, that is to say, she is very pure in heart,\nand does not know herself what it means... love. Madame von Kalitin\ntells her that he is a fine young man, and she obeys Madame von Kalitin\nbecause she is still quite a child, though she is nineteen; she says her\nprayers in the morning and in the evening--and that is very well; but\nshe does not love him. She can only love what is beautiful, and he is\nnot, that is, his soul is not beautiful.\"\n\nLemm uttered this whole speech coherently, and with fire, walking with\nlittle steps to and fro before the tea-table, and running his eyes over\nthe ground.\n\n\"Dearest maestro!\" cried Lavretsky suddenly, \"it strikes me you are in\nlove with cousin yourself.\"\n\nLemm stopped short all at once.\n\n\"I beg you,\" he began in an uncertain voice, \"do not make fun of me like\nthat. I am not crazy; I look towards the dark grave, not towards a rosy\nfuture.\"\n\nLavretsky felt sorry for the old man; he begged his pardon. After\nmorning tea, Lemm played him his cantata, and after dinner, at\nLavretsky's initiative, there was again talk of Lisa. Lavretsky listened\nto him with attention and curiosity.\n\n\"What do you say, Christopher Fedoritch,\" he said at last, \"you see\neverything here seems in good order now, and the garden is in full\nbloom, couldn't we invite her over here for a day with her mother and my\nold aunt... eh? Would you like it?\"\n\nLemm bent his head over his plate.\n\n\"Invite her,\" he murmured, scarcely audibly.\n\n\"But Panshin isn't wanted?\"\n\n\"No, he isn't wanted,\" rejoined the old man with an almost child-like\nsmile.\n\nTwo days later Fedor Ivanitch set off to the town to see the Kalitins.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV\n\n\nHe found them all at home, but he did not at once disclose his plan to\nthem; he wanted to discuss it first with Lisa alone. Fortune favoured\nhim; they were left alone in the drawing-room. They had some talk; she\nhad had time by now to grow used to him--and she was not shy as a rule\nwith any one. He listened to her, watched her, and mentally repeated\nLemm's words, and agreed with them. It sometimes happens that two people\nwho are acquainted, but not on intimate terms with one another, all\nof sudden grow rapidly more intimate in a few minutes, and the\nconsciousness of this greater intimacy is at once expressed in their\neyes, in their soft and affectionate smiles, and in their very gestures.\nThis was exactly what came to pass with Lavretsky and Lisa. \"So he is\nlike that,\" was her thought, as she turned a friendly glance on him;\n\"so you are like that,\" he too was thinking. And so he was not very\nmuch surprised when she informed him, not without a little faltering,\nhowever, that she had long wished to say something to him, but she was\nafraid of offending him.\n\n\"Don't be afraid; tell me,\" he replied, and stood still before her.\n\nLisa raised her clear eyes to him.\n\n\"You are so good,\" she began, and at the same time, she thought: \"Yes,\nI am sure he is good\"... \"you will forgive me, I ought not dare to speak\nof it to you... but--how could you... why did you separate from your\nwife?\"\n\nLavretsky shuddered: he looked at Lisa, and sat down near her.\n\n\"My child,\" he began, \"I beg you, do not touch upon that wound; your\nhands are tender, but it will hurt me all the same.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Lisa went on, as though she did not hear him, \"she has been to\nblame towards you. I don't want to defend her; but what God has joined,\nhow can you put asunder?\"\n\n\"Our convictions on that subject are too different, Lisaveta Mihalovna,\"\nLavretsky observed, rather sharply; \"we cannot understand one another.\"\n\nLisa grew paler: her whole frame was trembling slightly; but she was not\nsilenced.\n\n\"You must forgive,\" she murmured softly, \"if you wish to be forgiven.\"\n\n\"Forgive!\" broke in Lavretsky. \"Ought you not first to know whom you are\ninterceding for? Forgive that woman, take her back into my home, that\nempty, heartless creature! And who told you she wants to return to me?\nShe is perfectly contented with her position, I can assure you... But\nwhat a subject to discuss here! Her name ought never to be uttered\nby you. You are too pure, you are not capable of understanding such a\ncreature.\n\n\"Why abuse her?\" Lisa articulated with an effort. The trembling of her\nhands was perceptible now. \"You left her yourself, Fedor Ivanitch.\"\n\n\"But I tell you,\" retorted Lavretsky with an involuntary outburst of\nimpatience, \"you don't know what that woman is!\"\n\n\"Then why did you marry her?\" whispered Lisa, and her eyes feel.\n\nLavretsky got up quickly from his seat.\n\n\"Why did I marry her? I was young and inexperienced; I was deceived,\nI was carried away by a beautiful exterior. I knew no women. I knew\nnothing. God grant you may make a happier marriage! but let me tell you,\nyou can be sure of nothing.\"\n\n\"I too might be unhappy,\" said Lisa (her voice had begun to be\nunsteady), \"but then I ought to submit, I don't know how to say it; but\nif we do not submit\"--\n\nLavretsky clenched his hands and stamped with his foot.\n\n\"Don't be angry, forgive me,\" Lisa faltered hurriedly.\n\nAt that instant Marya Dmitrievna came in. Lisa got up and was going\naway.\n\n\"Stop a minute,\" Lavretsky cried after her unexpectedly. \"I have a great\nfavour to beg of your mother and you; to pay me a visit in my new abode.\nYou know, I have had a piano sent over; Lemm is staying with me; the\nlilac is in flower now; you will get a breath of country air, and you\ncan return the same day--will you consent?\" Lisa looked towards her\nmother; Marya Dmitrievna was assuming an expression of suffering; but\nLavretsky did not give her time to open her mouth; he at once kissed\nboth her hands. Marya Dmitrievna, who was always susceptible to\ndemonstrations of feeling, and did not at all anticipate such\neffusivements from the \"dolt,\" was melted and gave her consent. While\nshe was deliberating which day to fix, Lavretsky went up to Lisa, and,\nstill greatly moved, whispered to her aside: \"Thank you, you are a\ngood girl; I was to blame.\" And her pale face glowed with a bright, shy\nsmile; her eyes smiled too--up to that instant she had been afraid she\nhad offended him.\n\n\"Vladimir Nikolaitch can come with us?\" inquired Marya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lavretsky, \"but would it not be better to be just a\nfamily party?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, it seems,\" began Marya Dmitrievna. \"But as you please,\"\nshe added.\n\nIt was decided to take Lenotchka and Shurotchka. Marfa Timofyevna\nrefused to join in the expedition.\n\n\"It is hard for me, my darling,\" she said, \"to give my old bones a\nshaking; and to be sure there's nowhere for me to sleep at your\nplace: besides, I can't sleep in a strange bed. Let the young folks go\nfrolicking.\"\n\nLavretsky did not succeed in being alone again with Lisa; but he looked\nat her in such a way that she felt her heart at rest, and a little\nashamed, and sorry for him. He pressed her hand warmly at parting; left\nalone, she fell to musing.\n\n\n\nChapter XXV\n\n\nWhen Lavretsky reached home, he was met at the door of the drawing-room\nby a tall, thin man, in a thread-bare blue coat, with a wrinkled, but\nlively face, with disheveled grey whiskers, a long straight nose, and\nsmall fiery eyes. This was Mihalevitch, who had been his friend at the\nuniversity. Lavretsky did not at first recognise him, but embraced him\nwarmly directly he told his name.\n\nThey had not met since their Moscow days. Torrents of exclamations and\nquestions followed; long-buried recollections were brought to light.\nHurriedly smoking pipe after pipe, tossing off tea at a gulp, and\ngesticulating with his long hands, Mihalevitch related his adventures\nto Lavretsky; there was nothing very inspiriting in them, he could not\nboast of success in his undertakings--but he was constantly laughing a\nhoarse, nervous laugh. A month previously he had received a position in\nthe private counting-house of a spirit-tax contractor, two hundred and\nfifty miles from the town of O-----, and hearing of Lavretsky returned\nfrom abroad he had turned out of his way so as to see his old friend.\nMihalevitch and talked as impetuously as in his youth; made as much\nnoise and was as effervescent as of old. Lavretsky was about to acquaint\nhim with his new position, but Mihalevitch interrupted him, muttering\nhurriedly, \"I have heard, my dear fellow, I have heard--who could\nhave anticipated it?\" and at once turned the conversation upon general\nsubjects.\n\n\"I must set off to-morrow, my dear fellow,\" he observed; \"to-day if you\nwill excuse it, we will sit up late. I want above all to know what you\nare like, what are your views and convictions, what you have become,\nwhat life has taught you.\" (Mihalevitch still preserved the phraseology\nof 1830.) \"As for me, I have changed in much; the waves of life\nhave broken over my breast--who was it said that?--though in what is\nimportant, essential I have not changed; I believe as of old in the\ngood, the true: but I do not only believe--I have faith now, yes, I have\nfaith, faith. Listen, you know I write verses; there is no poetry in\nthem, but there is truth. I will read you aloud my last poem; I have\nexpressed my truest convictions in it. Listen.\" Mihalevitch fell to\nreading his poem: it was rather long, and ended with the following\nlines:\n\n    \"I gave myself to new feelings with all my heart,\n    And my soul became as a child's!\n    And I have burnt all I adored\n    And now adore all that I burnt.\"\n\nAs he uttered the two last lines, Mihalevitch all but shed tears; a\nslight spasm--the sign of deep emotion--passed over his wide mouth, his\nugly face lighted up. Lavretsky listened, and listened to him--and\nthe spirit of antagonism was aroused in him; he was irritated by\nthe ever-ready enthusiasm of the Moscow student, perpetually at\nboiling-point. Before a quarter of an hour had elapsed a heated argument\nhad broken out between them, one of these endless arguments, of which\nonly Russians are capable. After a separation of many years spent in two\ndifferent worlds, with no clear understanding of the other's ideas or\neven of their own, catching at words and replying only in words, they\ndisputed about the most abstract subjects, and they disputed as\nthough it were a matter of life and death for both: they shouted and\nvociferated so that every one in the house was startled, and poor\nLemm, who had locked himself up in his room directly after Mihalevitch\narrived, was bewildered, and began even to feel vaguely alarmed.\n\n\"What are you after all? a pessimist?\" cried Mihalevitch at one o'clock\nin the night.\n\n\"Are pessimists usually like this?\" replied Lavretsky. \"They are usually\nall pale and sickly--would you like me to lift you with one hand?\"\n\n\"Well, if you are not a pessimist you are a scepteec, that's still\nworse.\" Mihalevitch's talk had a strong flavour of his mother-country,\nLittle Russia. \"And what right have you to be a scepteec? You have had\nill-luck in life, let us admit; that was not your fault; you were born\nwith a passionate loving heart, and you were unnaturally kept out of the\nsociety of women: the first woman you came across was bound to deceive\nyou.\"\n\n\"She deceived you too,\" observed Lavretsky grimly.\n\n\"Granted, granted; I was the tool of destiny in it--what nonsense I\ntalk, though--there is no such thing as destiny; it is an old habit of\nexpressing things inexactly. But what does that prove?\"\n\n\"It proves this, that they distorted me from my childhood.\"\n\n\"Well, it's for you to straighten yourself! What's the good of being\na man, a male animal? And however that may be, is it possible, is it\npermissible, to reduce a personal, so to speak, fact to a general law,\nto an infallible principle?\"\n\n\"How a principle?\" interrupted Lavretsky; \"I don't admit--\"\n\n\"No, it is your principle, your principle,\" Mihalevitch interrupted in\nhis turn.\n\n\"You are an egoist, that's what it is!\" he was thundering an hour later:\n\"you wanted personal happiness, you wanted enjoyment in life, you wanted\nto live only for yourself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by personal happiness?\"\n\n\"And everything deceived you; everything crumbled away under your feet.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by personal happiness, I ask you?\"\n\n\"And it was bound to crumble away. Either you sought support where it\ncould not be found, or you built your house on shifting sands, or--\"\n\n\"Speak more plainly, or I can't understand you.\"\n\n\"Or--you may laugh if you like--or you had no faith, no warmth of heart;\nintellect, nothing but one farthing's worth of intellect... you are\nsimply a pitiful, antiquated Voltairean, that's what you are!\"\n\n\"I'm a Voltairean?\"\n\n\"Yes, like your father, and you yourself do not suspect it.\"\n\n\"After that,\" exclaimed Lavretsky, \"I have the right to call you a\nfanatic.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" replied Mihalevitch with a contrite air, \"I have not so far\ndeserved such an exalted title, unhappily.\"\n\n\"I have found out now what to call you,\" cried the same Mihalevitch, at\nthree o'clock in the morning. \"You are not a sceptic, nor a pessimist,\nnor a Voltairean, you are a loafer, and you are a vicious loafer, a\nconscious loafer, not a simple loafer. Simple loafers lie on the stove\nand do nothing because they don't know how to do anything; they don't\nthink about anything either, but you are a man of ideas--and yet you lie\non the stove; you could do something--and you do nothing; you lie idle\nwith a full stomach and look down from above and say, 'It's best to lie\nidle like this, because whatever people do, is all rubbish, leading to\nnothing.'\"\n\n\"And from what do you infer that I lie idle?\" Lavretsky protested\nstoutly. \"Why do you attribute such ideas to me?\"\n\n\"And, besides that, you are all, all the tribe of you,\" continued\nMihalevitch, \"cultivated loafers. You know which leg the German limps\non, you know what's amiss with the English and the French, and your\npitiful culture goes to make it worse, your shameful idleness, your\nabominable inactivity is justified by it. Some are even proud of it:\n'I'm such a clever fellow,' they say, 'I do nothing, while these fools\nare in a fuss.' Yes! and there are fine gentlemen among us--though\nI don't say this as to you--who reduce their whole life to a kind of\nstupor of boredom, get used to it, live in it, like--like a mushroom\nin white sauce,\" Mihalevitch added hastily, and he laughed at his own\ncomparison. \"Oh! this stupor of boredom is the ruin of Russians. Ours is\nthe age for work, and the sickening loafer\"...\n\n\"But what is all this abuse about?\" Lavretsky clamoured in his turn.\n\"Work--doing--you'd better say what is to be done, instead of abusing\nme, Desmosthenes of Poltava!\"\n\n\"There, what a thing to ask! I can't tell you that brother; that every\none ought to know for himself,\" retorted the Desmosthenes ironically.\n\"A landowner, a nobleman, and not know what to do? You have no faith, or\nelse you would know; no faith--and no intuition.\"\n\n\"Let me at least have time to breathe; you don't let me have time to\nlook round,\" Lavretsky besought him.\n\n\"Not a minute, nor a second!\" retorted Mihalevitch with an imperious\nwave of the hand. \"Not one second: death does not delay, and life ought\nnot to delay.\"\n\n\"And what a time, what a place for men to think of loafing!\" he cried\nat four o'clock, in a voice, however, which showed signs of sleepiness;\n\"among us! now! in Russia where every separate individual has a duty\nresting upon him, a solemn responsibility to God, to the people,\nto himself. We are sleeping, and the time is slipping away; we are\nsleeping.\"....\n\n\"Permit me to observe,\" remarked Lavretsky, \"that we are not sleeping at\npresent but rather preventing others from sleeping. We are straining\nour throats like the cocks--listen! there is one crowing for the third\ntime.\"\n\nThis sally made Mihalevitch laugh, and calmed him down. \"Good-bye till\nto-morrow,\" he said with a smile, and thrust his pipe into his pouch.\n\n\"Till to-morrow,\" repeated Lavretsky. But the friends talked for more\nthan hour longer. Their voices were no longer raised, however, and their\ntalk was quiet, sad, friendly talk.\n\nMihalevitch set off the next day, in spite of all Lavretsky's efforts\nto keep him. Fedor Ivanitch did not succeed in persuading him to remain;\nbut he talked to him to his heart's content. Mihalevitch, it appeared,\nhad not a penny to bless himself with. Lavretsky had noticed with pain\nthe evening before all the tokens and habits of years of poverty; his\nboots were shabby, a button was off on the back of his coat, on his\narrival, he had not even thought of asking to wash, and at supper he ate\nlike a shark, tearing his meat in his fingers, and crunching the bones\nwith his strong black teeth. It appeared, too, that he had made\nnothing out of his employment, that he now rested all his hopes on the\ncontractor who was taking him solely in order to have an \"educated man\"\nin his office.\n\nFor all that Mihalevitch was not discouraged, but as idealist or cynic,\nlived on a crust of bread, sincerely rejoicing or grieving over the\ndestinies of humanity, and his own vocation, and troubling himself very\nlittle as to how to escape dying of hunger. Mihalevitch was not married:\nbut had been in love times beyond number, and had written poems to all\nthe objects of his adoration; he sang with especial fervour the praises\nof a mysterious black-tressed \"noble Polish lady.\" There were rumours,\nit is true, that this \"noble Polish lady\" was a simple Jewess, very\nwell known to a good many cavalry officers--but, after all, what do you\nthink--does it really make any difference?\n\nWith Lemm, Mihalevitch did not get on; his noisy talk and brusque\nmanners scared the German, who was unused to such behaviour. One poor\ndevil detects another by instinct at once, but in old age he rarely gets\non with him, and that is hardly astonishing, he has nothing to share\nwith him, not even hopes.\n\nBefore setting off, Mihalevitch had another long discussion with\nLavretsky, foretold his ruin, if he did not see the error of his ways,\nexhorted him to devote himself seriously to the welfare of his peasants,\nand pointed to himself as an example, saying that he had been purified\nin the furnace of suffering; and in the same breath called himself\nseveral times a happy man, comparing himself with the fowl of the air\nand the lily of the field.\n\n\"A black lily, any way,\" observed Lavretsky.\n\n\"Ah, brother, don't be a snob!\" retorted Mihalevitch, good-naturedly,\n\"but thank God rather there is a pure plebeian blood in your veins too.\nBut I see that you want some pure, heavenly creature to draw you out of\nyour apathy.\"\n\n\"Thanks, brother,\" remarked Lavretsky. \"I have had quite enough of those\nheavenly creatures.\"\n\n\"Silence, ceeneec!\" cried Mihalevitch.\n\n\"Cynic,\" Lavretsky corrected him.\n\n\"Ceeneec, just so,\" repeated Mihalevitch unabashed.\n\nEven when he had taken his seat in the carriage, to which his flat,\nyellow, strangely light trunk was carried, he still talked; muffled in a\nkind of Spanish cloak with a collar, brown with age, and a clasp of two\nlion's paws; he went on developing his views on the destiny of Russian,\nand waving his swarthy hand in the air, as though he were sowing the\nseeds of her future prosperity. The horses started at last.\n\n\"Remember my three last words,\" he cried, thrusting his whole body out\nof the carriage and balancing so, \"Religion, progress, humanity!...\nFarewell.\"\n\nHis head, with a foraging cap pulled down over his eyes, disappeared.\nLavretsky was left standing alone on the steps, and he gazed steadily\ninto the distance along the road till the carriage disappeared out of\nsight. \"Perhaps he is right, after all,\" he thought as he went back into\nthe house; \"perhaps I am a loafer.\" Many of Mihalevitch's words had sunk\nirresistibly into his heart, though he had disputed and disagreed with\nhim. If a man only has a good heart, no one can resist him.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI\n\n\nTwo days later, Marya Dmitrievna visited Vassilyevskoe according to her\npromise, with all her young people. The little girls ran at once into\nthe garden, while Marya Dmitrievna languidly walked through the rooms\nand languidly admired everything. She regarded her visit to Lavretsky as\na sign of great condescension, almost as a deed of charity. She smiled\ngraciously when Anton and Apraxya kissed her hand in the old-fashioned\nhouse-servants' style; and in a weak voice, speaking through her nose,\nasked for some tea. To the great vexation of Anton, who had put on\nknitted white gloves for the purpose, tea was not handed to the grand\nlady visitor by him, but by Lavretsky's hired valet, who in the old\nman's words, had not a notion of what was proper. To make up for this,\nAnton resumed his rights at dinner: he took up a firm position behind\nMarya Dmitrievna's chair; and he would not surrender his post to any\none. The appearance of guests after so long an interval at Vassilyevskoe\nfluttered and delighted the old man. It was a pleasure to him to see\nthat his master was acquainted with such fine gentlefolk. He was not,\nhowever, the only one who was fluttered that day; Lemm, too, was in\nagitation. He had put on a rather short snuff-coloured coat with a\nswallow-tail, and tied his neck handkerchief stiffly, and he kept\nincessantly coughing and making way for people with a cordial and\naffable air. Lavretsky noticed with pleasure that his relations with\nLisa were becoming more intimate; she had held out her hand to him\naffectionately directly she came in. After dinner Lemm drew out of his\ncoat-tail pocket, into which he had continually been fumbling, a small\nroll of music-paper and compressing his lips he laid it without speaking\non the pianoforte. It was a song composed by him the evening before, to\nsome old-fashioned German words, in which mention was made of the stars.\nLisa sat down at once to the piano and played at sight the song....\nAlas! the music turned out to be complicated and painfully strained; it\nwas clear that the composer had striven to express something passionate\nand deep, but nothing had come of it; the effort had remained an effort.\nLavretsky and Lisa both felt this, and Lemm understood it. Without\nuttering a single word, he put his song back into his pocket, and in\nreply to Lisa's proposal to play it again, he only shook his head and\nsaid significantly: \"Now--enough!\" and shrinking into himself he turned\naway.\n\nTowards evening the whole party went out to fish. In the pond behind the\ngarden there were plenty of carp and groundlings. Marya Dmitrievna was\nput in an arm-chair near the banks, in the shade, with a rug under her\nfeet and the best line was given to her. Anton as an old experienced\nangler offered her his services. He zealously put on the worms, and\nclapped his hand on them, spat on them and even threw in the line with a\ngraceful forward swing of his whole body. Marya Dmitrievna spoke of\nhim the same day to Fedor Ivanitch in the following phrase, in\nboarding-school French: \"Il n'y a plus maintenant de ces gens comme ca,\ncomme autrefois.\" Lemm with the two little girls went off further to the\ndam of the pond; Lavretsky took up his position near Lisa. The fish were\ncontinually biting, the carp were constantly flashing in the air with\ngolden and silvery sides as they were drawn in; the cries of pleasure of\nthe little girls were incessant, even Marya Dmitrievna uttered a\nlittle feminine shriek on two occasions. The fewest fish were caught by\nLavretsky and Lisa; probably this was because they paid less attention\nthan the others to the angling, and allowed their floats to swim back\nright up to the bank. The high reddish reeds rustled quietly around,\nthe still water shone quietly before them, and quietly too they talked\ntogether. Lisa was standing on a small raft; Lavretsky sat on the\ninclined trunk of a willow; Lisa wore a white gown, tied round the waist\nwith a broad ribbon, also white; her straw hat was hanging on one hand,\nand in the other with some effort she held up the crooked rod. Lavretsky\ngazed at her pure, somewhat severe profile, at her hair drawn back\nbehind her ears, at her soft cheeks, which glowed like a little child's,\nand thought, \"Oh, how sweet you are, bending over my pond!\" Lisa did not\nturn to him, but looked at the water, half frowning, to keep the sun\nout of her eyes, half smiling. The shade of the lime-tree near fell upon\nboth.\n\n\"Do you know,\" began Lavretsky, \"I have been thinking over our last\nconversation a great deal, and have come to the conclusion that you are\nexceedingly good.\"\n\n\"That was not at all my intention in-----\" Lisa was beginning to reply,\nand she was overcome with embarrassment.\n\n\"You are good,\" repeated Lavretsky. \"I am a rough fellow, but I feel\nthat every one must love you. There's Lemm for instance; he is simply in\nlove with you.\"\n\nLisa's brows did not exactly frown, they contracted slightly; it always\nhappened with her when she heard something disagreeable to her.\n\n\"I was very sorry for him to-day,\" Lavretsky added, \"with his\nunsuccessful song. To be young and to fail is bearable; but to be old\nand not be successful is hard to bear. And how mortifying it is to feel\nthat one's forces are deserting one! It is hard for an old man to\nbear such blows!... Be careful, you have a bite.... They say,\" added\nLavretsky after a short pause, \"that Vladimir Nikolaitch has written a\nvery pretty song.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lisa, \"it is only a trifle, but not bad.\"\n\n\"And what do you think,\" inquired Lavretsky; \"is he a good musician?\"\n\n\"I think he has great talent for music; but so far he has not worked at\nit, as he should.\"\n\n\"Ah! And is he a good sort of man?\"\n\nLisa laughed and glanced quickly at Fedor Ivanitch.\n\n\"What a queer question!\" she exclaimed, drawing up her line and throwing\nit in again further off.\n\n\"Why is it queer? I ask you about him, as one who has only lately come\nhere, as a relation.\"\n\n\"A relation?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am, it seems, a sort of uncle of yours?\"\n\n\"Vladimir Nikolaitch has a good heart,\" said Lisa, \"and he is clever;\nmaman likes him very much.\"\n\n\"And do you like him?\"\n\n\"He is nice; why should I not like him?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Lavretsky uttered and ceased speaking. A half-mournful,\nhalf-ironical expression passed over his face. His steadfast gaze\nembarrassed Lisa, but he went on smiling.--\"Well, God grant them\nhappiness!\" he muttered at last, as though to himself, and turned away\nhis head.\n\nLisa flushed.\n\n\"You are mistaken, Fedor Ivanitch,\" she said: \"you are wrong in thinking\n.... But don't you like Vladimir Nikolaitch?\" she asked suddenly.\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I think he has no heart.\"\n\nThe smile left Lisa's face.\n\n\"It is your habit to judge people severely,\" she observed after a long\nsilence.\n\n\"I don't think it is. What right have I to judge others severely, do you\nsuppose, when I must ask for indulgency myself? Or have you forgotten\nthat I am a laughing stock to everyone, who is not too indifferent even\nto scoff?... By the way,\" he added, \"did you keep your promise?\"\n\n\"What promise?\"\n\n\"Did you pray for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I prayed for you, and I pray for you every day. But please do not\nspeak lightly of that.\"\n\nLavretsky began to assure Lisa that the idea of doing so had never\nentered his head, that he had the deepest reverence for every\nconviction; then he went off into a discourse upon religion,\nits significance in the history of mankind, the significance of\nChristianity.\n\n\"One must be a Christian,\" observed Lisa, not without some effort, \"not\nso as to know the divine... and the... earthly, because every man has to\ndie.\"\n\nLavretsky raised his eyes in involuntary astonishment upon Lisa and met\nher gaze.\n\n\"What a strange saying you have just uttered!\" he said.\n\n\"It is not my saying,\" she replied.\n\n\"Not yours.... But what made you speak of death?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I often think of it.\"\n\n\"Often?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One would not suppose so, looking at you now; you have such a bright,\nhappy face, you are smiling.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am very happy just now,\" replied Lisa simply.\n\nLavretsky would have liked to seize both her hands, and press them\nwarmly.\n\n\"Lisa, Lisa!\" cried Marya Dmitrievna, \"do come here, and look what a\nfine carp I have caught.\"\n\n\"In a minute, maman,\" replied Lisa, and went towards her, but Lavretsky\nremained sitting on his willow. \"I talk to her just as if life were not\nover for me,\" he thought. As she went away, Lisa hung her hat on a twig;\nwith strange, almost tender emotion, Lavretsky looked at the hat, and\nits long rather crumpled ribbons. Lisa soon came back to him, and again\ntook her stand on the platform.\n\n\"What makes you think Vladimir Nikolaitch has no heart?\" she asked a few\nminutes later.\n\n\"I have told you already that I may be mistaken; time will show,\nhowever.\"\n\nLisa grew thoughtful. Lavretsky began to tell her about his daily life\nat Vassilyevskoe, about Mihalevitch, and about Anton; he felt a need\nto talk to Lisa, to share with her everything that was passing in his\nheart; she listened so sweetly, so attentively; her few replies and\nobservations seemed to him so simple and so intelligent. He even told\nher so.\n\nLisa was surprised.\n\n\"Really?\" she said; \"I thought that I was like my maid, Nastya; I had no\nwords of my own. She said one day to her sweetheart: 'You must be dull\nwith me; you always talk so finely to me, and I have no words of my\nown.'\"\n\n\"And thank God for it!\" thought Lavretsky.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII\n\n\nMeanwhile the evening had come on, Marya Dmitrievna expressed a desire\nto return home, and the little girls were with difficulty torn away from\nthe pond, and made ready. Lavretsky declared that he would escort his\nguests half-way, and ordered his horse to be saddled. As he was handing\nMarya Dmitrievna into the coach, he bethought himself of Lemm; but the\nold man could nowhere be found. He had disappeared directly after\nthe angling was over. Anton, with an energy remarkable for his years,\nslammed the doors, and called sharply, \"Go on, coachman!\" the coach\nstarted. Marya Dmitrievna and Lisa were seated in the back seat; the\nchildren and their maid in the front. The evening was warm and still,\nand the windows were open on both sides. Lavretsky trotted near the\ncoach on the side of Lisa, with his arm leaning on the door--he had\nthrown the reigns on the neck of his smoothly-pacing horse--and now and\nthen he exchanged a few words with the young girl. The glow of sunset\nwas! disappearing; night came on, but the air seemed to grow even\nwarmer. Marya Dmitrievna was soon slumbering, the little girls and the\nmaid fell asleep also. The coach rolled swiftly and smoothly along;\nLisa was bending forward, she felt happy; the rising moon lighted up her\nface, the fragrant night on breeze breathed on her eyes and cheeks. Her\nhand rested on the coach door near Lavretsky's hand. And he was happy;\nborne along in the still warmth of the night, never taking his eyes off\nthe good young face, listening to the young voice that was melodious\neven in a whisper, as it spoke of simple, good things, he did not even\nnotice that he had gone more than half-way. He did not want to wake\nMarya Dmitrievna, he lightly pressed Lisa's hand and said, \"I think we\nare friends now, aren't we?\" She nodded, he stopped his horse, and\nthe coach rolled away, lightly swaying and oscillating up and down;\nLavretsky turned homeward at a walking pace. The witchery of the summer\nnight enfolded him; all around him seemed suddenly so strange--and at\nthe same time so long known; so sweetly familiar. Everywhere near and\nafar--and one could see in to the far distance, though the eye could\nnot make out clearly much of what was seen--all was at peace; youthful,\nblossoming life seemed expressed in this deep peace. Lavretsky's horse\nstepped out bravely, swaying evenly to right and left; its great black\nshadow moved along beside it. There was something strangely sweet in the\ntramp of its hoofs, a strange charm in the ringing cry of the quails.\nThe stars were lost in a bright mist; the moon, not yet at the full,\nshone with steady brilliance; its light was shot in an azure stream over\nthe sky, and fell in patches of smoky gold on the thin clouds as they\ndrifted near. The freshness of the air drew a slight moisture into the\neyes, sweetly folded all the limbs, and flowed freely into the lungs.\nLavretsky rejoiced in it, and was glad at his own rejoicing. \"Come, we\nare still alive,\" he thought; \"we have not been altogether destroyed\nby\"--he did not say--by whom or by what. Then he fell to thinking of\nLisa, that she could hardly love Panshin, that if he had met her under\ndifferent circumstances--God knows what might have come of it; that\nhe undertook Lemm though Lisa had no words of \"her own:\" but that, he\nthought, was not true; she had words of her own. \"Don't speak light of\nthat,\" came back to Lavretsky's mind. He rode a long way with his head\nbent in thought, then drawing himself up, he slowly repeated aloud:\n\n   \"And I have burnt all I adored,\n    And now I adore all that I burnt.\"\n\nThen he gave his horse a switch with the whip, and galloped all the way\nhome.\n\nDismounting from his horse, he looked round for the last time with an\ninvoluntary smile of gratitude. Night, still, kindly night stretched\nover hills and valleys; from afar, out of its fragrant depths--God\nknows whence--whether from the heavens or the earth--rose a soft, gentle\nwarmth. Lavretsky sent a last greeting to Lisa, and ran up the steps.\n\nThe next day passed rather dully. Rain was falling from early morning;\nLemm wore a scowl, and kept more and more tightly compressing his lips,\nas though he had taken an oath never to open them again. When he went\nto his room, Lavretsky took up to bed with him a whole bundle of French\nnewspapers, which had been lying for more than fortnight on his table\nunopened. He began indifferently to tear open the wrappings, and glanced\nhastily over the columns of the newspapers--in which, however, there was\nnothing new. He was just about to throw them down--and all at once he\nleaped out of bed as if he had been stung. In an article in one of the\npapers, M. Jules, with whom we are already familiar, communicated to\nhis readers a \"mournful intelligence, that charming, fascinating Moscow\nlady,\" he wrote, \"one of the queens of fashion, who adorned Parisian\nsalons, Madame de Lavretsky, had died almost suddenly, and this\nintelligence, unhappily only too well-founded, had only just reached\nhim, M. Jules. He was,\" so he continued, \"he might say a friend of the\ndeceased.\"\n\nLavretsky dressed, went out into the garden, and till morning he walked\nup and down the same path.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII\n\n\nThe next morning, over their tea, Lemm asked Lavretsky to let him have\nthe horses to return to town. \"It's time for me to set to work, that is,\nto my lessons,\" observed the old man. \"Besides, I am only wasting time\nhere.\" Lavretsky did not reply at once; he seemed abstracted. \"Very\ngood,\" he said at last; \"I will come with you myself.\" Unaided by the\nservants, Lemm, groaning and wrathful, packed his small box and tore up\nand burnt a few sheets of music-paper. The horses were harnessed. As he\ncame out of his own room, Lavretsky put the paper he had read last night\nin his pocket. During the whole course of the journey both Lemm and\nLavretsky spoke little to one another; each was occupied with his own\nthoughts, and each was glad not to be disturbed by the other; and they\nparted rather coolly; which is often the way, however, with friends in\nRussia. Lavretsky conducted the old man to his little house; the latter\ngot out, took his trunk and without holding out his hand to his friend\n(he was holding his trunk in both arms before his breast), without\neven looking at him, he said to him in Russian, \"good-bye!\" \"Good-bye,\"\nrepeated Lavretsky, and bade the coachman drive to his lodging. He had\ntaken rooms in the town of O-----... After writing a few letters and\nhastily dining, Lavretsky went to the Kalitins'. In their drawing-room\nhe found only Panshin, who informed him that Marya Dmitrievna would\nbe in directly, and at once, with charming cordiality, entered into\nconversation with him. Until that day, Panshin had always treated\nLavretsky, not exactly haughtily, but at least condescendingly; but\nLisa, in describing her expedition of the previous day to Panshin, had\nspoken of Lavretsky as an excellent and clever man, that was enough; he\nfelt bound to make a conquest of an \"excellent man.\" Panshin began with\ncompliments to Lavretsky, with a description of the rapture in which,\naccording to him, the whole family of Marya Dmitrievna! spoke of\nVassilyevskoe; and then, according to his custom, passing neatly to\nhimself, began to talk about his pursuits, and his views on life, the\nworld and government service; uttered a sentence or two upon the\nfuture of Russia, and the duty of rulers to keep a strict hand over the\ncountry; and at this point laughed light-heartedly at his own expense,\nand added that among other things he had been intrusted in Petersburg\nwith the duty de poplariser l'idee du cadastre. He spoke somewhat at\nlength, passing over all difficulties with careless self-confidence, and\nplaying with the weightiest administrative and political questions, as a\njuggler plays with balls. The expressions: \"That's what I would do if I\nwere in the government;\" \"you as a man of intelligence, will agree with\nme at once,\" were constantly on his lips. Lavretsky listened coldly to\nPanshin's chatter; he did not like this handsome, clever, easily-elegant\nyoung man, with his bright smile, affable voice, and inquisitive eyes.\nPanshin, with the quick insight into the feelings of others, which was\npeculiar to him, soon guessed that he was not giving his companion any\nspecial satisfaction, and made a plausible excuse to go away, inwardly\ndeciding that Lavretsky might be an \"excellent man,\" but he was\nunattractive, aigri, and, en somme, rather absurd. Marya Dmitrievna made\nher appearance escorted by Gedeonovsky, then Marfa Timofyevna and Lisa\ncame in; and after them the other members of the household; and then the\nmusical amateur, Madame Byelenitsin, arrived, a little thinnish lady,\nwith a languid, pretty, almost childish little face, wearing a rusting\ndress, a striped fan, and heavy gold bracelets. Her husband was with\nher, a fat red-faced man, with large hands and feet, white eye-lashes,\nand an immovable smile on his thick lips; his wife never spoke to him in\ncompany, but at home, in moments of tenderness, she used to call him her\nlittle sucking-pig. Panshin returned; the rooms were very full of\npeople and noise. Such a crowd was not to Lavretsky's taste; and he was\nparticularly irritated by Madame Byelenitsin, who kept staring at him\nthrough her eye-glasses. He would have gone away at once but for Lisa;\nhe wanted to say a few words to her alone, but for a long time he\ncould not get a favourable opportunity, and had to content himself with\nfollowing her in secret delight with his eyes; never had her face seemed\nsweeter and more noble to him. She gained much from being near Madame\nByelenitsin. The latter was for ever fidgeting in her chair, shrugging\nher narrow shoulders, giving little girlish giggles, and screwing up her\neyes and then opening them wide; Lisa sat quietly, looked directly at\nevery one and did not laugh at all. Madame Kalitin sat down to a game\nof cards with Marfa Timofyevna, Madame Byelenitsin, and Gedeonovsky, who\nplayed very slowly, and constantly made mistakes, frowning and wiping\nhis face with his handkerchief. Panshin assumed a melancholy air, and\nexpressed himself in brief, pregnant, and gloomy phrases, played\nthe part, in fact, of the unappreciated genius, but in spite of the\nentreaties of Madame Byelenitsin, who was very coquettish with him,\nhe would not consent to sing his son; he felt Lavretsky's presence a\nconstraint. Fedor Ivanitch also spoke little the peculiar expression of\nhis face struck Lisa directly he came into the room; she felt at once\nthat he had something to tell her, and though she could not herself have\nsaid why, she was afraid to question him. At last, as she was going into\nthe next room to pour out tea, she involuntarily turned her head in his\ndirection. He at once went after her.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" she said, setting the teapot on the samovar.\n\n\"Why, have you noticed anything?\" he asked.\n\n\"You are not the same to-day as I have always seen you before.\"\n\nLavretsky bent over the table.\n\n\"I wanted,\" he began, \"to tell you a piece of news, but now it is\nimpossible. However, you can read what is marked with pencil in that\narticle,\" he added, handing her the paper he had brought with him. \"Let\nme ask you to keep it a secret; I will come to-morrow morning.\"\n\nLisa was greatly bewildered. Panshin appeared in the doorway. She put\nthe newspaper in her pocket.\n\n\"Have you read Obermann, Lisaveta Mihalovna?\" Panshin asked her\npensively.\n\nLisa made him a reply in passing, and went out of the room and\nup-stairs. Lavretsky went back to the drawing-room and drew near the\ncard-table. Marfa Timofyevna, flinging back the ribbons of her cap and\nflushing with annoyance, began to complain of her partner, Gedeonovsky,\nwho in her words, could not play a bit.\n\n\"Car-playing, you see,\" she said, \"is not so easy as talking scandal.\"\n\nThe latter continued to blink and wipe his face. Lisa came into the\ndrawing-room and sat down in a corner; Lavretsky looked at her, she\nlooked at him, and both the felt the position insufferable. He read\nperplexity and a kind of secret reproachfulness in her face. He could\nnot talk to her as he would have liked to do; to remain in the same room\nwith her, a guest among other guests, was too painful; he decided to go\naway. As he took leave of her, he managed to repeat that he would come\nto-morrow, and added that he trusted in her friendship.\n\n\"Come,\" she answered with the same perplexity on her face.\n\nPanshin brightened up at Lavretsky's departure: he began to give advice\nto Gedeonovsky, paid ironical attentions to Madame Byelenitsin, and at\nlast sang his song. But with Lisa he still spoke and looked as before,\nimpressively and rather mournfully.\n\nAgain Lavretsky did not sleep all night. He was not sad, he was not\nagitated, he was quite clam; but he could not sleep. He did not even\nremember the past; he simply looked at his life; his heart beat slowly\nand evenly; the hours glided by; he did not even think of sleep. Only at\ntimes the thought flashed through his brain: \"But it is not true, it\nis all nonsense,\" and he stood still, bowed his head and again began to\nponder on the life before him.\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX\n\n\nMarya Dmitrievna did not give Lavretsky an over-cordial welcome when he\nmade his appearance the following day. \"Upon my word, he's always in\nand out,\" she thought. She did not much care for him, and Panshin, under\nwhose influence she was, had been very artful and disparaging in his\npraises of him the evening before. And as she did not regard him as\na visitor, and did not consider it necessary to entertain a relation,\nalmost one of the family, it came to pass that in less than half-an\nhour's time he found himself walking in an avenue in the grounds with\nLisa. Lenotchka and Shurotchka were running about a few paces from them\nin the flower-garden.\n\nLisa was as calm as usual but more than usually pale. She took out of\nher pocket and held out to Lavretsky the sheet of the newspaper folded\nup small.\n\n\"That is terrible!\" she said.\n\nLavretsky made no reply.\n\n\"But perhaps it is not true, though,\" added Lisa.\n\n\"That is why I asked you not to speak of it to any one.\"\n\nLisa walked on a little.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she began: \"you are not grieved? not at all?\"\n\n\"I do not know myself what I feel,\" replied Lavretsky.\n\n\"But you loved her once?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very much?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So you are not grieved at her death?\"\n\n\"She was dead to me long ago.\"\n\n\"It is sinful to say that. Do not be angry with me. You call me your\nfriend: a friend may say everything. To me it is really terrible....\nYesterday there was an evil look in your face.... Do you remember not\nlong ago how you abused her, and she, perhaps, at that very time was\ndead? It is terrible. It has been sent to you as a punishment.\"\n\nLavretsky smiled bitterly.\n\n\"Do you think so? At least, I am now free.\"\n\nLisa gave a slight shudder.\n\n\"Stop, do not talk like that. Of what use is your freedom to you? You\nought not to be thinking of that now, but of forgiveness.\"\n\n\"I forgave her long ago,\" Lavretsky interposed with a gesture of the\nhand.\n\n\"No, that is not it,\" replied Lisa, flushing. \"You did not understand\nme. You ought to be seeking to be forgiven.\"\n\n\"To be forgiven by whom?\"\n\n\"By whom? God. Who can forgive us, but God?\"\n\nLavretsky seized her hand.\n\n\"Ah, Lisaveta Mihalovna, believe me,\" he cried, \"I have been punished\nenough as it is. I have expiated everything already, believe me.\"\n\n\"That you cannot know,\" Lisa murmured in an undertone. \"You have\nforgotten--not long ago, when you were talking to me--you were not ready\nto forgive her.\"\n\nShe walked in silence along the avenue.\n\n\"And what about your daughter?\" Lisa asked, suddenly stopping short.\n\nLavretsky started.\n\n\"Oh, don't be uneasy! I have already sent letters in all directions. The\nfuture of my daughter, as you call--as you say--is assured. Do not be\nuneasy.\"\n\nLisa smiled mournfully.\n\n\"But you are right,\" continued Lavretsky, \"what can I do with my\nfreedom? What good is it to me?\"\n\n\"When did you get that paper?\" said Lisa, without replying to his\nquestion.\n\n\"The day after your visit.\"\n\n\"And is it possible you did not even shed tears?\"\n\n\"No. I was thunderstruck; but where were tears to come from? Should I\nweep over the past? but it is utterly extinct for me! Her very fault did\nnot destroy my happiness, but only showed me that it had never been at\nall. What is there to weep over now? Though indeed, who knows? I might,\nperhaps, have been more grieved if I had got this news a fortnight\nsooner.\"\n\n\"A fortnight?\" repeated Lisa. \"But what has happened then in the last\nfortnight?\"\n\nLavretsky made no answer, and suddenly Lisa flushed even more than\nbefore.\n\n\"Yes, yes, you guess why,\" Lavretsky cried suddenly, \"in the course of\nthis fortnight I have come to know the value of a pure woman's heart,\nand my past seems further from me than ever.\"\n\nLisa was confused, and went gently into the flower-garden towards\nLenotchka and Shurotchka.\n\n\"But I am glad I showed you that newspaper,\" said Lavretsky, walking\nafter her; \"already I have grown used to hiding nothing from you, and I\nhope you will repay me with the same confidence.\"\n\n\"Do you expect it?\" said Lisa, standing still. \"In that case I\nought--but no! It is impossible.\"\n\n\"What is it? Tell me, tell me.\"\n\n\"Really, I believe I ought not--after all, though,\" added Lisa, turning\nto Lavretsky with a smile, \"what's the good of half confidence? Do you\nknow I received a letter today?\"\n\n\"From Panshin?\"\n\n\"Yes. How did you know?\"\n\n\"He asks for your hand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Lisa, looking Lavretsky straight in the face with a\nserious expression.\n\nLavretsky on his side looked seriously at Lisa.\n\n\"Well, and what answer have you given him?\" he managed to say at last.\n\n\"I don't know what answer to give,\" replied Lisa, letting her clasped\nhands fall.\n\n\"How is that? Do you love him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, I like him; he seems a nice man.\"\n\n\"You said the very same thing, and in the very same words, three days\nago. I want to know do you love him with that intense passionate feeling\nwhich we usually call love?\"\n\n\"As you understand it--no.\"\n\n\"You're not in love with him?\"\n\n\"No. But is that necessary?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Mamma likes him,\" continued Lisa, \"he is kind; I have nothing against\nhim.\"\n\n\"You hesitate, however.\"\n\n\"Yes--and perhaps--you, your words are the cause of it. Do you remember\nwhat you said three days ago? But that is weakness.\"\n\n\"O my child!\" cried Lavretsky suddenly, and his voice was shaking,\n\"don't cheat yourself with sophistries, don't call weakness the cry of\nyour heart, which is not ready to give itself without love. Do not take\non yourself such a fearful responsibility to this man, whom you don't\nlove, though you are ready to belong to him.\"\n\n\"I'm obeying, I take nothing on myself,\" Lisa was murmuring.\n\n\"Obey your heart; only that will tell you the truth,\" Lavretsky\ninterrupted her. \"Experience, prudence, all that is dust and ashes! Do\nnot deprive yourself of the best, of the sole happiness on earth.\"\n\n\"Do you say that, Fedor Ivanitch? You yourself married for love, and\nwere you happy?\"\n\nLavretsky threw up his arms.\n\n\"Ah, don't talk about me! You can't even understand all that a young,\ninexperienced, badly brought-up boy may mistake for love! Indeed though,\nafter all, why should I be unfair to myself? I told you just now that I\nhad not had happiness. No! I was not happy!\"\n\n\"It seems to me, Fedor Ivanitch,\" Lisa murmured in a low voice--when she\ndid not agree with the person whom she was talking, she always dropped\nher voice; and now too she was deeply moved--\"happiness on earth does\nnot depend on ourselves.\"\n\n\"On ourselves, ourselves, believe me\" (he seized both her hands; Lisa\ngrew pale and almost with terror but still steadfastly looked at him):\n\"if only we do not ruin our lives. For some people marriage for love may\nbe unhappiness; but not for you, with your calm temperament, and your\nclear soul; I beseech you, do not marry without love, from a sense\nof duty, self-sacrifice, or anything.... That is infidelity, that is\nmercenary, and worse still. Believe me,--I have the right to say so; I\nhave paid dearly for the right. And if your God--.\"\n\nAt that instant Lavretsky noticed that Lenotchka and Shurotchka were\nstanding near Lisa, and staring in dumb amazement at him. He dropped\nLisa's hands, saying hurriedly, \"I beg your pardon,\" and turned away\ntowards the house.\n\n\"One thing only I beg of you,\" he added, returning again to Lisa; \"don't\ndecide at once, wait a little, think of what I have said to you. Even\nif you don't believe me, even if you did decide on a marriage of\nprudence--even in that case you mustn't marry Panshin. He can't be your\nhusband. You will promise me not to be in a hurry, won't you?\"\n\nLisa tried to answer Lavretsky, but she did not utter a word--not\nbecause she was resolved to \"be in a hurry,\" but because her heart was\nbeating too violently and a feeling, akin to terror, stopped her breath.\n\n\n\nChapter XXX\n\n\nAs he was coming away from the Kalitins, Lavretsky met Panshin; they\nbowed coldly to one another. Lavretsky went to his lodgings, and locked\nhimself in. He was experiencing emotions such as he had hardly ever\nexperienced before. How long ago was it since he had thought himself in\na state of peaceful petrifaction? How long was it since he had felt\nas he had expressed himself at the very bottom of the river? What had\nchanged his position? What had brought him out of his solitude? The most\nordinary, inevitable, though always unexpected event, death? Yes; but he\nwas not thinking so much of his wife's death and his own freedom, as of\nthis question--what answer would Lisa give Panshin? He felt that in the\ncourse of the last three days, he had come to look at her with different\neyes; he remembered how after returning home when he thought of her in\nthe silence of the night, he had said to himself, \"if only!\"... That \"if\nonly\"--in which he had referred to the past, to the impossible had come\nto pass, though not as he had imagined it,--but his freedom alone was\nlittle. \"She will obey her mother,\" he thought, \"she will marry Panshin;\nbut even if she refuses him, won't it be just the same as far as I am\nconcerned?\" Going up to the looking-glass he minutely scrutinised his\nown face and shrugged his shoulders.\n\nThe day passed quickly by in these meditations; and evening came.\nLavretsky went to the Kalitins'. He walked quickly, but his pace\nslackened as he drew near the house. Before the steps was standing\nPanshin's light carriage. \"Come,\" though Lavretsky, \"I will not be an\negoist\"--and he went into the house. He met with no one within-doors,\nand there was no sound in the drawing-room; he opened the door and saw\nMarya Dmitrievna playing picquet with Panshin. Panshin bowed to him\nwithout speaking, but the lady of the house cried, \"Well, this is\nunexpected!\" and slightly frowned. Lavretsky sat down near her, and\nbegan to look at her cards.\n\n\"Do you know how to play picquet?\" she asked him with a kind of hidden\nvexation, and then declared that she had thrown away a wrong card.\n\nPanshin counted ninety, and began calmly and urbanely taking tricks with\na severe and dignified expression of face. So it befits diplomatists\nto play; this was no doubt how he played in Petersburg with some\ninfluential dignitary, whom he wished to impress with a favourable\nopinion of his solidity and maturity. \"A hundred and one, a hundred and\ntwo, hearts, a hundred and three,\" sounded his voice in measured tones,\nand Lavretsky could not decide whether it had a ring of reproach or of\nself-satisfaction.\n\n\"Can I see Marfa Timofyevna?\" he inquired, observing that Panshin was\nsetting to work to shuffle the cards with still more dignity. There was\nnot a trace of the artist to be detected in him now.\n\n\"I think you can. She is at home, up-stairs,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna;\n\"inquire for her.\"\n\nLavretsky went up-stairs. He found Marfa Timofyevna also at cards; she\nwas playing old maid with Nastasya Karpovna. Roska barked at him; but\nboth the old ladies welcomed him cordially. Marfa Timofyevna especially\nseemed in excellent spirits.\n\n\"Ah! Fedya!\" she began, \"pray sit down, my dear. We are just finishing\nour game. Would you like some preserve? Shurotchka, bring him a pot of\nstrawberry. You don't want any? Well, sit there; only you mustn't smoke;\nI can't bear your tobacco, and it makes Matross sneeze.\"\n\nLavretsky made haste to assure her that he had not the least desire to\nsmoke.\n\n\"Have you been down-stairs?\" the old lady continued. \"Whom did you see\nthere? Is Panshin still on view? Did you see Lisa? No? She was meaning\nto come up here. And here she is: speak of angels--\"\n\nLisa came into the room, and she flushed when she saw Lavretsky.\n\n\"I came in for a minute, Marfa Timofyevna,\" she was beginning.\n\n\"Why for a minute?\" interposed the old lady. \"Why are you always in\nsuch a hurry, you young people? You see I have a visitor; talk to him a\nlittle, and entertain him.\"\n\nLisa sat down on the edge of a chair; she raised her eyes to\nLavretsky--and felt that it was impossible not to let him know how her\ninterview with Panshin had ended. But how was she to do it? She felt\nboth awkward and ashamed. She had not long known him, this man who\nrarely went to church, and took his wife's death so calmly--and here was\nshe, confiding al her secrets to him.... It was true he took an interest\nin her; she herself trusted him and felt drawn to him; but all the same,\nshe was ashamed, as though a stranger had been into her pure, maiden\nbower.\n\nMarfa Timofyevna came to her assistance.\n\n\"Well, if you won't entertain him,\" said Marfa Timofyevna, \"who will,\npoor fellow? I am too old for him, he is too clever for me, and for\nNastasya Karpovna he's too old, it's only the quite young men she will\nlook at.\"\n\n\"How can I entertain Fedor Ivanitch?\" said Lisa. \"If he likes, had I not\nbetter play him something on the piano?\" she added irresolutely.\n\n\"Capital; you're my clever girl,\" rejoined Marfa Timofyevna. \"Step\ndown-stairs, my dears; when you have finished, come back: I have been\nmade old maid, I don't like it, I want to have my revenge.\"\n\nLisa got up. Lavretsky went after her. As she went down the staircase,\nLisa stopped.\n\n\"They say truly,\" she began, \"that people's hearts are full of\ncontradictions. Your example ought to frighten me, to make me distrust\nmarriage for love; but I--\"\n\n\"You have refused him?\" interrupted Lavretsky.\n\n\"No; but I have not consented either. I told him everything, everything\nI felt, and asked him to wait a little. Are you pleased with me?\" she\nadded with a swift smile--and with a light touch of her hand on the\nbanister she ran down the stairs.\n\n\"What shall I play to you?\" she asked, opening the piano.\n\n\"What you like,\" answered Lavretsky as he sat down so that he could look\nat her.\n\nLisa began to play, and for a long while she did not lift her eyes from\nher fingers. She glanced at last at Lavretsky, and stopped short; his\nface seemed strange and beautiful to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he replied; \"I'm very happy; I'm glad of you, I'm glad to see\nyou--go on.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Lisa a few moments later, \"that if he had really\nloved me, he would not have written that letter; he must have felt that\nI could not give him an answer now.\"\n\n\"That is of no consequence,\" observed Lavretsky, \"what is important is\nthat you don't love him.\"\n\n\"Stop, how can we talk like this? I keep thinking of you dead wife, and\nyou frighten me.\"\n\n\"Don't you think, Voldemar, that Liseta plays charmingly?\" Marya\nDmitrievna was saying at that moment to Panshin.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Panshin, \"very charmingly.\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna looked tenderly at her young partner, but the latter\nassumed a still more important and care-worn air and called fourteen\nkings.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XXXI\n\n\nLavretsky was not a young man; he could not long delude himself as to\nthe nature of the feeling inspired in him by Lisa; he was brought on\nthat day to the final conviction that he loved her. This conviction did\nnot give him ay great pleasure. \"Have I really nothing better to do,\"\nhe thought, \"at thirty-five than to put my soul into a woman's keeping\nagain? But Lisa is not like her; she would not demand degrading\nsacrifices from me: she would not tempt me away from my duties; she\nwould herself incite me to hard honest work, and we would walk hand in\nhand towards a noble aim. Yes,\" he concluded his reflections, \"that's\nall very fine, but the worst of it is that she does not in the least\nwish to walk hand in hand with me. She meant it when she said that\nI frightened her. But she doesn't love Panshin either--a poor\nconsolation!\"\n\nLavretsky went back to Vassilyevskoe, but he could not get through\nfour days there--so dull it seemed to him. He was also in agonies of\nsuspense; the news announced by M. Jules required confirmation, and he\nhad received no letters of any kind. He returned to the town and spent\nan evening at the Kalitins'. He could easily see that Marya Dmitrievna\nhad to been set against him; but he succeeded in softening her a little,\nby losing fifteen roubles to her at picquet, and he spent nearly half\nan hour almost alone with Lisa in spite of the fact that her mother had\nadvised her the previous evening not to be too intimate with a man qui\na un si grand ridicule. He found a change in her; she had become, as it\nwere, more thoughtful. She reproached him for his absence and asked him\nwould he not go on the morrow to mass? (The next day was Sunday.)\n\n\"Do go,\" she said before he had time to answer, \"we will pray together\nfro the repose of her soul.\" Then she added that she did not know how to\nact--she did not know whether she had the right to make Panshin wait any\nlonger for her decision.\n\n\"Why so?\" inquired Lavretsky.\n\n\"Because,\" she said, \"I begin now to suspect what that decision will\nbe.\"\n\nShe declared that her head ached and went to her own room up-stairs,\nhesitatingly holding out the tips of her fingers to Lavretsky.\n\nThe next day Lavretsky went to mass. Lisa was already in the church when\nhe came in. She noticed him though she did not turn round towards him.\nShe prayed fervently, her eyes were full of a calm light, calmly she\nbowed her head and lifted it again. He felt that she was praying for him\ntoo, and his heart was filled with a marvelous tenderness. He was happy\nand a little ashamed. The people reverently standing, the homely faces,\nthe harmonious singing, the scent of incense, the long slanting gleams\nof light from the windows, the very darkness of the walls and arched\nroofs, all went to his heart. For long he had not been to church\nfor long he had not turned to God: even now he uttered no words of\nprayer--he did not even pray without words--but, at least, for a moment\nin all his mind, if not in his body, he bowed down and meekly humbled\nhimself to earth. He remembered how, in his childhood, he had always\nprayed in church until he had felt, as it were, a cool touch on his!\nbrow; that, he used to think then, is the guardian angel receiving me,\nlaying on me the seal of grace. He glanced at Lisa. \"You brought me\nhere,\" he thought, \"touch me, touch my soul.\" She was still praying\ncalmly; her face seemed him to him full of joy, and he was softened\nanew: he prayed for another soul, peace; for his own, forgiveness.\n\nThey met in the porch; she greeted him with glad and gracious\nseriousness. The sun brightly lighted up the young grass in the\nchurch-yard, and the striped dresses and kerchiefs of the women; the\nbells of the churches near were tinkling overhead; and the crows were\ncawing about the hedges. Lavretsky stood with uncovered head, a smile\non his lips; the light breeze lifted his hair, and the ribbons of Lisa's\nhat. He put Lisa and Lenotchka who was with her into their carriage,\ndivided all his money among the poor, and peacefully sauntered home.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXII\n\n\nPainful days followed for Fedor Ivanitch. He found himself in a\ncontinual fever. Every morning he made for the post, and tore open\nletters and papers in agitation, and nowhere did he find anything\nwhich could confirm or disprove the fateful rumour. Sometimes he was\ndisgusting to himself. \"What am I about,\" he thought, \"waiting, like a\nvulture for blood, for certain news of my wife's death?\" He went to the\nKalitins every day, but things had grown no easier for him there; the\nlady of the house was obviously sulky with him, and received him very\ncondescendingly. Panshin treated him with exaggerated politeness; Lemm\nhad entrenched himself in his misanthropy and hardly bowed to him, and,\nworst of all, Lisa seemed to avoid him. When she happened to be\nleft alone with him, instead of her former candour there was visible\nembarrassment on her part, she did not know what to say to him, and he,\ntoo, felt confused. In the space of a few days Lisa had become quite\ndifferent from what she was as he knew her: in her movements, her voice,\nher very laugh a secret tremor, an unevenness never there before was\napparent. Marya Dmitrievna, like a true egoist, suspected nothing; but\nMarfa Timofyevna began to keep a watch over her favourite. Lavretsky\nmore than once reproached himself for having shown Lisa the newspaper\nhe had received; he could not but be conscious that in his spiritual\ncondition there was something revolting to a pure nature. He imagined\nalso that the change in Lisa was the result of her inward conflicts, her\ndoubts as to what answer to give Panshin.\n\nOne day she brought him a book, a novel of Walter Scott's, which she had\nherself asked him for.\n\n\"Have you read it?\" he said.\n\n\"No; I can't bring myself to read just now,\" she answered, and was about\nto go away.\n\n\"Stop a minute, it is so long since I have been alone with you. You seem\nto be afraid of me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why so, pray?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nLavretsky was silent.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he began, \"you haven't yet decided?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said, not raising her eyes.\n\n\"You understand me.\"\n\nLisa flushed crimson all at once.\n\n\"Don't ask me about anything!\" she broke out hotly. \"I know nothing; I\ndon't know myself.\" And instantly she was gone.\n\nThe following day Lavretsky arrived at the Kalitins' after dinner and\nfound there all the preparations for an evening service. In the corner\nof the dining-room on a square table covered with a clean cloth were\nalready arranged, leaning up against the wall, the small holy pictures\nin old frames, set with tarnished jewels. The old servant in a grey coat\nand shoes was moving noiselessly and without haste all about the\nroom; he set two wax-candles in the slim candlesticks before the holy\npictures, crossed himself, bowed, and slowly went out. The unlighted\ndrawing-room was empty. Lavretsky went into the dining-room and asked if\nit was some one's name-day.\n\nIn a whisper the told him no, but that the evening service had been\narranged at the desire of Lisaveta Mihalovna and Marfa Timofyevna; that\nit had been intended to invite a wonder-working image, but that the\nlatter had gone thirty versts away to visit a sick man. Soon the priest\narrived with the deacons; he was a man no longer young, with a large\nbald head; he coughed loudly in the hall: the ladies at once filed\nslowly out of the boudoir, and went up to receive his blessing;\nLavretsky bowed to them in silence; and in silence to him. The priest\nstood still for a little while, coughed once again, and asked in a bass\nundertone--\n\n\"You wish me to begin?\"\n\n\"Pray begin father,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna.\n\nHe began to put on his robes; a deacon in a surplice asked obsequiously\nfor a hot ember; there was a scent of incense. The maids and\nmen-servants came out from the hall and remained huddled close together\nbefore the door. Roska, who never came down from up-stairs, suddenly\nran into the dining-room; they began to chase her out; she was scared,\ndoubled back into the room and sat down; a footman picked her up and\ncarried her away.\n\nThe evening service began. Lavretsky squeezed himself into a corner; his\nemotions were strange, almost sad; he could not himself make out clearly\nwhat he was feeling. Marya Dmitrievna stood in front of all, before\nthe chairs; she crossed herself with languid carelessness, like a grand\nlady, and first looked about her, then suddenly lifted her eyes to\nthe ceiling; she was bored. Marfa Timofyevna looked worried; Nastasya\nKarpovna bowed down to the ground and got up with a kind of discreet,\nsubdued rustle; Lisa remained standing in her place motionless; from\nthe concentrated expression of her face it could be seen that she was\npraying steadfastly and fervently. When she bowed to the cross at the\nend of the service, she also kissed the large red hand of the priest.\nMarya Dmitrievna invited the latter to have some tea; he took off his\nvestment, assumed a somewhat more worldly air, and passed into the\ndrawing-room with the ladies. Conversation--not too lively--began. The\npriest drank four cups of tea, incessantly wiping his bald head with his\nhandkerchief; he related among other things that the merchant Avoshnikov\nwas subscribing seven hundred roubles to gilding the \"cumpola\" of the\nchurch, and informed them of a sure remedy against freckles. Lavretsky\ntried to sit near Lisa, but her manner was severe, almost stern, and she\ndid not once glance at him. She appeared intentionally not to observe\nhim; a kind of cold, grave enthusiasm seemed to have taken possession\nof her. Lavretsky for some reason or other tried to smile and to say\nsomething amusing; but there was perplexity in his heart, and he went\naway at last in secret bewilderment .... He felt there was something in\nLisa to which he could never penetrate.\n\nAnother time Lavretsky was sitting in the drawing-room listening to the\nsly but tedious gossip of Gedeonovsky, when suddenly, without\nhimself knowing why, he turned round and caught a profound, attentive\nquestioning look in Lisa's eyes.... It was bent on him, this enigmatic\nlook. Lavretsky thought of it the whole night long. His love was not\nlike a boy's; sighs and agonies were not in his line, and Lisa herself\ndid not inspire a passion of that kind; but for every age love has its\ntortures--and he was spared none of them.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIII\n\n\nOne day Lavretsky, according to his habit, was at the Kalitins'. After\nan exhaustingly hot day, such a lovely evening had set in that Marya\nDmitrievna, in spite of her aversion to a draught, ordered all the\nwindows and doors into the garden to be thrown open, and declared\nthat she would not play cards, that it was a sin to play cards in such\nweather, and one ought to enjoy nature. Panshin was the only guest. He\nwas stimulated by the beauty of the evening, and conscious of a flood of\nartistic sensations, but he did not care to sing before Lavretsky, so he\nfell to reading poetry; he read aloud well, but too self-consciously and\nwith unnecessary refinements, a few poems of Lermontov (Pushkin had not\nthen come into fashion again). Then suddenly, as though ashamed of his\nenthusiasm, began, a propos of the well-known poem, \"A Reverie,\" to\nattack and fall foul of the younger generation. While doing so he did\nnot lose the opportunity of expounding how he would change everything!\nafter his own fashion, if the power were in his hands. \"Russia,\" he\nsaid, \"has fallen behind Europe; we must catch her up. It is maintained\nthat we are young--that's nonsense. Moreover we have no inventiveness:\nHomakov himself admits that we have not even invented mouse-traps.\nConsequently, whether we will or no, we must borrow from others. We are\nsick, Lermontov says--I agree with him. But we are sick from having only\nhalf become Europeans, we must take a hair of the dog that bit us (\"le\ncadastre,\" thought Lavretsky). \"The best head, les meilleures tetes,\"\nhe continued, \"among us have long been convinced of it. All peoples are\nessentially alike; only introduce among them good institutions, and\nthe thing is done. Of course there may be adaptation to the existing\nnational life; that is our affair--the affair of the official (he\nalmost said \"governing\") class. But in case of need don't be uneasy.\nThe institutions will transform the life itself.\" Marya Dmitrievna\nmost feelingly assented to all Panshin said. \"What a clever man,\" she\nthought, \"is talking in my drawing-room!\" Lisa sat in silence leaning\nback against the window; Lavretsky too was silent. Marfa Timofyevna,\nplaying cards with her old friend in the corner, muttered something to\nherself. Panshin walked up and down the room, and spoke eloquently, but\nwith secret exasperation. It seemed as if he were abusing not a whole\ngeneration but a few people known to him. In a great lilac bush in the\nKalitins' garden a nightingale had built its nest; its first evening\nnotes filled the pauses of the eloquent speech; the first stars were\nbeginning to shine in the rosy sky over the motionless tops of the\nlimes. Lavretsky got up and began to answer Panshin; an argument sprang\nup. Lavretsky championed the youth and the independence of Russia; he\nwas ready to throw over himself and his generation, but he stood up for\nthe new men, their convictions and desires. Panshin answered sharply\nand irritably. He maintained that the intelligent people ought to change\neverything, and was at last even brought to the point of forgetting his\nposition as a kammer-yunker, and his career as an official, and calling\nLavretsky an antiquated conservative, even hinting--very remotely it\nis true--at his dubious position in society. Lavretsky did not lose his\ntemper. He did not raise his voice (he recollected that Mihalevitch\ntoo had called him antiquated but an antiquated Voltairean), and\ncalmly proceeded to refute Panshin at all points. He proved to him the\nimpracticability of sudden leaps and reforms from above, founded neither\non knowledge of the mother-country, nor on any genuine faith in any\nideal, even a negative one. He brought forward his own education as an\nexample, and demanded before all things a recognition of the true spirit\nof the people and submission to it, without which even a courageous\ncombat against error is impossible. Finally he admitted the\nreproach--well-deserved as he thought--of reckless waste of time and\nstrength.\n\n\"That is all very fine!\" cried Panshin at last, getting angry. \"You now\nhave just returned to Russia, what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"Cultivate the soil,\" answered Lavretsky, \"and try to cultivate it as\nwell as possible.\"\n\n\"That is very praiseworthy, no doubt,\" rejoined Panshin, \"and I have\nbeen told that you have already had great success in that line; but you\nmust allow that not every one is fit for pursuits of that kind.\"\n\n\"Une nature poetique,\" observed Marya Dmitrievna, \"cannot, to be sure,\ncultivate... et puis, it is your vocation, Vladimir Nikolaich, to do\neverything en grand.\"\n\nThis was too much even for Panshin: he grew confused and changed the\nconversation. He tried to turn it upon the beauty of the starlit sky,\nthe music of Schubert; nothing was successful. He ended by proposing\nto Marya Dmitrievna a game of picquet. \"What! on such an evening?\" she\nreplied feebly. She ordered the cards to be brought in, however. Panshin\ntore open a new pack of cards with a loud crash, and Lisa and Lavretsky\nboth got up as if by agreement, and went and placed themselves near\nMarfa Timofyevna. They both felt all at once so happy that they were\neven a little afraid of remaining alone together, and at the same time\nthey both felt that the embarrassment they had been conscious of for\nthe last few days had vanished, and would return no more. The old lady\nstealthily patted Lavretsky on the cheek, slyly screwed up her eyes, and\nshook her head once or twice, adding in a whisper, \"You have shut up our\nclever friend, many thanks.\" Everything was hushed in the room; the only\nsound was the faint crackling of the wax-candles, and sometimes the tap\nof a hand on the table, and an exclamation or reckoning of points; and\nthe rich torrent of the nightingale's song, powerful piercingly sweet,\npoured in at the window, together with the dewy freshness of the night.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIV\n\n\nLisa had not uttered a word in the course of the dispute between\nLavretsky and Panshin, but she had followed it attentively and was\ncompletely on Lavretsky's side. Politics interested her very little; but\nthe supercilious tone of the worldly official (he had never delivered\nhimself in that way before) repelled her; his contempt for Russia\nwounded her. It had never occurred to Lisa that she was a patriot;\nbut her heart was with the Russian people; the Russian turn of mind\ndelighted her; she would talk for hours together without ceremony to the\npeasant-overseer of her mother's property when he came to the town, and\nshe talked to him as to an equal, without any of the condescension of a\nsuperior. Lavretsky felt all this; he would not have troubled himself to\nanswer Panshin by himself; he had spoken only for Lisa's sake. They had\nsaid nothing to one another, their eyes even had seldom met. But they\nboth knew that they had grown closer that evening, they knew that\nthey liked! and disliked the same things. On one point only were they\ndivided; but Lisa secretly hoped to bring him to God. They sat near\nMarfa Timofyevna, and appeared to be following her play; indeed, they\nwere really following it, but meanwhile their hearts were full, and\nnothing was lost on them; for them the nightingale sang, and the stars\nshone, and the trees gently murmured, lulled to sleep by the summer\nwarmth and softness. Lavretsky was completely carried away, and\nsurrendered himself wholly to his passion--and rejoiced in it. But no\nword can express what was passing in the pure heart of the young girl.\nIt was a mystery for herself. Let it remain a mystery for all. No one\nknows, no one has seen, nor will ever see, how the grain, destined to\nlife and growth, swells and ripens in the bosom of the earth.\n\nTen o'clock struck. Marfa Timofyevna went off up-stairs to her own\napartments with Nastasya Karpovna. Lavretsky and Lisa walked across the\nroom, stopped at the open door into the garden, looked into the darkness\nin the distance and then at one another, and smiled. They could have\ntaken each other's hands, it seemed, and talked to their hearts'\ncontent. They returned to Marya Dmitrievna and Panshin, where a game of\npicquet was still dragging on. The last king was called at last, and\nthe lady of the house rose, sighing and groaning from her well-cushioned\neasy chair. Panshin took his hat, kissed Marya Dmitrievna's hand,\nremarking that nothing hindered some happy people now from sleeping,\nbut that he had to sit up over stupid papers till morning, and departed,\nbowing coldly to Lisa (he had not expected that she would ask him to\nwait so long for an answer to his offer, and he was cross with her for\nit). Lavretsky followed him. They parted at the gate. Panshin walked\nhis! coachman by poking him in the neck with the end of his stick, took\nhis seat in the carriage and rolled away. Lavretsky did not want to go\nhome. He walked away from the town into the open country. The night was\nstill and clear, though there was no moon. Lavretsky rambled a long time\nover the dewy grass. He came across a little narrow path; and went along\nit. It led him up to a long fence, and to a little gate; he tried, not\nknowing why, to push it open. With a faint creak the gate opened, as\nthough it had been waiting the touch of his hand. Lavretsky went into\nthe garden. After a few paces along a walk of lime-trees he stopped\nshort in amazement; he recognised the Kalitins' garden.\n\nHe moved at once into a black patch of shade thrown by a thick clump of\nhazels, and stood a long while without moving, shrugging his shoulders\nin astonishment.\n\n\"This cannot be for nothing,\" he thought.\n\nAll was hushed around. From the direction of the house not a sound\nreached him. He went cautiously forward. At the bend of an avenue\nsuddenly the whole house confronted him with its dark face; in two\nupstair-windows only a light was shining. In Lisa's room behind the\nwhite curtain a candle was burning, and in Marfa Timofyevna's bedroom a\nlamp shone with red-fire before the holy picture, and was reflected with\nequal brilliance on the gold frame. Below, the door on to the balcony\ngaped wide open. Lavretsky sat down on a wooden garden-seat, leaned on\nhis elbow, and began to watch this door and Lisa's window. In the town\nit struck midnight; a little clock in the house shrilly clanged\nout twelve; the watchman beat it with jerky strokes upon his board.\nLavretsky had no thought, no expectation; it was sweet to him to feel\nhimself near Lisa, to sit in her garden on the seat where she herself\nhad sat more than once.\n\nThe light in Lisa's room vanished.\n\n\"Sleep well, my sweet girl,\" whispered Lavretsky, still sitting\nmotionless, his eyes fixed on the darkened window.\n\nSuddenly the light appeared in one of the windows of the ground-floor,\nthen changed into another, and a third.... Some one was walking through\nthe rooms with a candle. \"Can it be Lisa? It cannot be.\" Lavretsky got\nup.... He caught a glimpse of a well-known face--Lisa came into\nthe drawing-room. In a white gown, her plaits hanging loose on her\nshoulders, she went quietly up to the table, bent over it, put down the\ncandle, and began looking for something. Then turning round facing the\ngarden, she drew near the open door, and stood on the threshold, a light\nslender figure all in white. A shiver passed over Lavretsky.\n\n\"Lisa!\" broke hardly audibly from his lips.\n\nShe started and began to gaze into the darkness.\n\n\"Lisa!\" Lavretsky repeated louder, and he came out of the shadow of the\navenue.\n\nLisa raised her head in alarm, and shrank back. She had recognised him.\nHe called to her a third time, and stretched out his hands to her. She\ncame away from the door and stepped into the garden.\n\n\"Is it you?\" she said. \"You here?\"\n\n\"I--I--listen to me,\" whispered Lavretsky, and seizing her hand he led\nher to the seat.\n\nShe followed him without resistance, her pale face, her fixed eyes, and\nall her gestures expressed an unutterable bewilderment. Lavretsky made\nher sit down and stood before her.\n\n\"I did not mean to come here,\" he began. \"Something brought me.... I--I\nlove you,\" he uttered in involuntary terror.\n\nLisa slowly looked at him. It seemed as though she only at that instant\nknew where she was and what was happening. She tried to get up, she\ncould no, and she covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"Lisa,\" murmured Lavretsky. \"Lisa,\" he repeated, and fell at her feet.\n\nHer shoulders began to heave slightly; the fingers of her pale hands\nwere pressed more closely to her face.\n\n\"What is it?\" Lavretsky urged, and he heard a subdued sob. His heart\nstood still.... He knew the meaning of those tears. \"Can it be that you\nlove me?\" he whispered, and caressed her knees.\n\n\"Get up,\" he heard her voice, \"get up, Fedor Ivanitch. What are we\ndoing?\"\n\nHe got up and sat beside her on the seat. She was not weeping now, and\nshe looked at him steadfastly with her wet eyes.\n\n\"It frightens me: what are we doing?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I love you,\" he said again. \"I am ready to devote my whole life to\nyou.\"\n\nShe shuddered again, as though something had stung her, and lifted her\neyes towards heaven.\n\n\"All that is in God's hands,\" she said.\n\n\"But you love me, Lisa? We shall be happy.\" She dropped her eyes; he\nsoftly drew her to him, and her head sank on to his shoulder.... He bent\nhis head a little and touched her pale lips.\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later Lavretsky was standing before the little garden gate.\nHe found it locked and was obliged to get over the fence. He returned\nto the town and walked along the slumbering streets. A sense of immense,\nunhoped-for happiness filled his soul; all his doubts had died away.\n\"Away, dark phantom of the past,\" he thought. \"She loves me, she will\nbe mine.\" Suddenly it seemed to him that in the air over his head were\nfloating strains of divine triumphant music. He stood still. The music\nresounded in still greater magnificence; a mighty flood of melody--and\nall his bliss seemed speaking and singing in its strains. He looked\nabout him; the music floated down from two upper windows of a small\nhouse.\n\n\"Lemm?\" cried Lavretsky as he ran to the house. \"Lemm! Lemm!\" he\nrepeated aloud.\n\nThe sounds died away and the figure of the old man in a dressing-gown,\nwith his throat bare and his hair dishevelled, appeared at the window.\n\n\"Aha!\" he said with dignity, \"is it you?\"\n\n\"Christopher Fedoritch, what marvellous music! for mercy's sake, let me\nin.\"\n\nWithout uttering a word, the old man with a majestic flourish of the arm\ndropped the key of the street door from the window.\n\nLavretsky hastened up-stairs, went into the room and was about to rush\nup to Lemm; but the latter imperiously motioned him to a seat, saying\nabruptly in Russian, \"Sit down and listen,\" sat down himself to the\npiano, and looking proudly and severely about him, he began to play.\nIt was long since Lavretsky had listened to anything like it. The sweet\npassionate melody went to his heart from the first note; it was glowing\nand languishing with inspiration, happiness and beauty; it swelled and\nmelted away; it touched on all that is precious, mysterious, and holy\non earth. It breathed of deathless sorrow and mounted dying away to the\nheavens. Lavretsky drew himself up, and rose cold and pale with ecstasy.\nThis music seemed to clutch his very soul, so lately shaken by the\nrapture of love, the music was glowing with love too. \"Again!\" he\nwhispered as the last chord sounded. The old man threw him an eagle\nglance, struck his hand on his chest and saying deliberately in his own\ntongue, \"This is my work, I am a great musician,\" he played again his\nmarvellous composition. There was no candle in the room; the light of\nthe rising moon fell aslant on the window; the soft air was vibrating\nwith sound; the poor little room seemed a holy place, and the old man's\nhead stood out noble and inspired in the silvery half light. Lavretsky\nwent up to him and embraced him. At first Lemm did not respond to\nhis embrace and even pushed him away with his elbow. For a long while\nwithout moving in any limb he kept the same severe, almost morose\nexpression, and only growled out twice, \"aha.\" At last his face\nrelaxed, changed, and grew calmer, and in response to Lavretsky's warm\ncongratulations he smiled a little at first, then burst into tears, and\nsobbed weakly like a child.\n\n\"It is wonderful,\" he said, \"that you have come just at this moment; but\nI know all, I know all.\"\n\n\"You know all?\" Lavretsky repeated in amazement.\n\n\"You have heard me,\" replied Lemm, \"did you not understand that I knew\nall?\"\n\nTill daybreak Lavretsky could not sleep, all night he was sitting on his\nbed. And Lisa too did not sleep; she was praying.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXV\n\n\nThe reader knows how Lavretsky grew up and developed. Let us say a few\nwords about Lisa's education. She was in her tenth year when her father\ndied; but he had not troubled himself much about her. Weighed down\nwith business cares, for ever anxious for the increase of his property,\nbilious, sharp and impatient, he gave money unsparingly for the\nteachers, tutors, dress and other necessities of his children; but he\ncould not endure, as he expressed it, \"to be dandling his squallers,\"\nand indeed had no time to dandle them. He worked, took no rest from\nbusiness, slept little, rarely played cards, and worked again. He\ncompared himself to a horse harnessed to a threshing-machine. \"My life\nhas soon come to an end,\" was his comment on his deathbed, with a bitter\nsmile on his parched lips. Marya Dmitrievna did not in reality trouble\nherself about Lisa any more than her husband, though she had boasted to\nLavretsky that she alone had educated her children. She dressed her up\nlike a doll, stroked her on the head before visitors and called her a\nclever child and a darling to her face, and that was all. Any kind of\ncontinuous care was too exhausting for the indolent lady. During her\nfather's lifetime, Lisa was in the hands of a governess, Mademoiselle\nMoreau from Paris, after his death she passed into the charge of Marfa\nTimofyevna. Marfa Timofyevna the reader knows already; Mademoiselle\nMoreau was a tiny wrinkled creature with little bird-like ways and a\nbird's intellect. In her youth she had led a very dissipated life, but\nin old age she had only two passions left--gluttony and cards. When she\nhad eaten her fill, and was neither playing cards nor chattering, her\nface assumed an expression almost death-like. She was sitting, looking,\nbreathing--yet it was clear that there was not an idea in her head. One\ncould not even call her good-natured. Birds are not good-natured. Either\nas a result of her frivolous youth or of the air of Paris, which she had\nbreathed from childhood, a kind of cheap universal scepticism had found\nits way into her, usually expressed by the words: tout ca c'est des\nbetises. She spoke ungrammatically, but in a pure Parisian jargon, did\nnot talk scandal and had no caprices--what more can one desire in a\ngoverness? Over Lisa she had little influence; all the stronger was the\ninfluence on her of her nurse, Agafya Vlasyevna.\n\nThis woman's story was remarkable. She came of a peasant family. She was\nmarried at sixteen to a peasant; but she was strikingly different from\nher peasant sisters. Her father had been twenty years starosta, and had\nmade a good deal of money, and he spoiled her. She was exceptionally\nbeautiful, the best-dressed girl in the whole district, clever,\nready with her tongue, and daring. Her master Dmitri Pestov, Marya\nDmitrievna's father, a man of modest and gentle character, saw her one\nday at the threshing-floor, talked to her and fell passionately in love\nwith her. She was soon left a widow; Pestov, though he was a married\nman, took her into his house and dressed her like a lady. Agafya at\nonce adapted herself to her new position, just as if she had never lived\ndifferently all her life. She grew fairer and plumper; her arms grew\nas \"floury white\" under her muslin-sleeves as a merchant's lady's; the\nsamovar never left her table; she would wear nothing except silk or\nvelvet, and slept on well-stuffed feather-beds. This blissful existence\nlasted for five years, but Dmitri Pestov died; his widow, a kind-hearted\nwoman, out of regard for the memory of the deceased, did not wish\nto treat her rival unfairly, all the more because Agafya had never\nforgotten herself in her presence. She married her, however, to a\nshepherd, and sent her a long way off. Three years passed. It happened\none hot summer day that her mistress in driving past stopped at the\ncattle-yard. Agafya regaled her with such delicious cool cream,\nbehaved so modestly, and was so neat, so bright, and so contented\nwith everything that her mistress signified her forgiveness to her and\nallowed her to return to the house. Within six months she had become\nso much attached to her that she raised her to be housekeeper, and\nintrusted the whole household management to her. Agafya again returned\nto power, and again grew plump and fair; her mistress put the most\ncomplete confidence in her. So passed five years more. Misfortune again\novertook Agafya. Her husband, whom she had promoted to be a footman,\nbegan to drink, took to vanishing from the house, and ended by stealing\nsix of the mistress' silver spoons and hiding them till a favourable\nmoment in his wife's box. It was opened. He was sent to be a shepherd\nagain, and Agafya fell into disgrace. She was not turned out of the\nhouse, but was degraded from housekeeper to being a sewing-woman and\nwas ordered to wear a kerchief on her head instead of a cap. To the\nastonishment of every one, Agafya accepted with humble resignation the\nblow that had fallen upon her. She was at that time about thirty, all\nher children were dead and her husband did not live much longer. The\ntime had come for her to reflect. And she did reflect. She became very\nsilent and devout, never missed a single matin's service nor a single\nmass, and gave away all her fine clothes. She spent fifteen years\nquietly, peacefully, and soberly, never quarrelling with any one and\ngiving way to every one. If any! one scolded her, she only bowed to them\nand thanked them for the admonition. Her mistress had long ago forgiven\nher, raised her out of disgrace, and made her a present of a cap of her\nown. But she was herself unwilling to give up the kerchief and always\nwore a dark dress. After her mistress' death she became still more quiet\nand humble. A Russian readily feels fear, and affection; but it is hard\nto gain his respect: it is not soon given, nor to every one. For Agafya\nevery one in the home had great respect; no one even remembered her\nprevious sins, as though they had been buried with the old master.\n\nWhen Kalitin became Marya Dmitrievna's husband, he wanted to intrust the\ncare of the house to Agafya. But she refused \"on account of temptation;\"\nhe scolded her, but she bowed humbly and left the room. Kalitin was\nclever in understanding men; he understood Agafya and did not forget\nher. When he moved to the town, he gave her, with her consent, the place\nof nurse to Lisa, who was only just five years old.\n\nLisa was at first frightened by the austere and serious face of her\nnew nurse; but she soon grew used to her and began to love her. She was\nherself a serious child. Her features recalled Kalitin's decided and\nregular profile, only her eyes were not her father's; they were lighted\nup by a gentle attentiveness and goodness, rare in children. She did not\ncare to play with dolls, never laughed loudly or for long, and behaved\nwith great decorum. She was not often thoughtful, but when she was, it\nwas almost always with some reason. After a short silence, she usually\nturned to some grown-up person with a question which showed that her\nbrain had been at work upon some new impression. She very early got\nover childish lispings, and by the time she was four years old spoke\nperfectly plainly. She was afraid of her father; her feeling towards\nher mother was undefinable, she was not afraid of her, nor was she\ndemonstrative to her; but she was not demonstrative even towards Agafya,\nthough she was the only person she loved. Agafya never left her. It\nwas curious to see them together. Agafya, all in black, with a dark\nhandkerchief on her head, her face thin and transparent as wax, but\nstill beautiful and expressive, would be sitting upright, knitting a\nstocking; Lisa would sit at her feet in a little arm-chair, also busied\nover some kind of work, and seriously raising her clear eyes, listening\nto what Agafya was relating to her. And Agafya did not tell her stories;\nbut in even measured accents she would narrate the life of the Holy\nVirgin, the lives of hermits, saints, and holy men. She would tell\nLisa how the holy men lived in deserts, how they were saved, how they\nsuffered hunger and want, and did not fear kings, but confessed Christ;\nhow fowls of the air brought them food and wild beasts listened to them,\nand flowers sprang up on the spots where their blood had been spilt.\n\"Wall-flowers?\" asked Lisa one ay, she was very fond of flowers....\nAgafya spoke to Lisa gravely and meekly, as though she felt herself to\nbe unworthy to utter such high and holy words. Lisa listened to her, and\nthe image of the all-seeing, all-knowing God penetrated with a kind of\nsweet power into her very soul, filling it with pure and reverent awe;\nbut Christ became for her something near, well-known, almost familiar.\nAgafya taught her to pray also. Sometimes she wakened Lisa early at\ndaybreak, dressed her hurriedly, and took her in secret to matins. Lisa\nfollowed her on tiptoe, almost holding her breath. The cold and twilight\nof the early morning, the freshness and emptiness of the church, the\nvery secrecy of these unexpected expeditions, the cautious return home\nand to her little bed, all these mingled impressions of the forbidden,\nstrange, and holy agitated the little girl and penetrated to the very\ninnermost depths of her nature. Agafya never censured any one, and never\nscolded Lisa for being naughty. When she was displeased at anything,\nshe only kept silence. And Lisa understood this silence; with a child's\nquick-sightedness she knew very well, too, when Agafya was displeased\nwith other people, Marya Dmitrievna, or Kalitin himself. For a little\nover three years, Agafya waited on Lisa, then Mademoiselle Moreau\nreplaced her; but the frivolous Frenchwoman, with her cold ways and\nexclamation, tout ca c'est des betises, could never dislodge her dear\nnurse from Lisa's heart; the seeds that had been dropped into it had\nbecome too deeply rooted. Besides, though Agafya no longer waited on\nLisa, she was still in the house and often saw her charge, who believed\nin her as before.\n\nAgafya did not, however, get on well with Marfa Timofyevna, when she\ncame to live in the Kalitins' house. Such gravity and dignity on the\npart of one who had once worn the motley skirt of a peasant wench\ndispleased the impatient and self-willed old lady. Agafya asked leave to\ngo on a pilgrimage and she never came back. There were dark rumours that\nshe had gone off to a retreat of sectaries. But the impression she had\nleft in Lisa's soul was never obliterated. She went as before to\nthe mass as to a festival, she prayed with rapture, with a kind of\nrestrained and shamefaced transport, at which Marya Dmitrievna secretly\nmarvelled not a little, and even Marfa Timofyevna, though she did not\nrestrain Lisa in any way, tried to temper her zeal, and would not let\nher make too many prostrations to the earth in her prayers; it was not a\nlady-like habit, she would say. In her studies Lisa worked well, that\nis to say perseveringly; she was not gifted with specially brilliant\nabilities, or great intellect; she could not succeed in anything without\nlabour. She played the piano well, but only Lemm knew what it had cost\nher. She had read little; she had not \"words of her own,\" but she had\nher own ideas, and she went her own way. It was not only on the surface\nthat she took after her father; he, too, had never asked other people\nwhat was to be done. So she had grown up tranquilly and restfully till\nshe had reached the age of nineteen. She was very charming, without\nbeing aware of it herself. Her every movement was full of spontaneous,\nsomewhat awkward gracefulness; her voice had the silvery ring of\nuntouched youth, the least feeling of pleasure called forth an\nenchanting smile on her lips, and added a deep light and a kind of\nmystic sweetness to her kindling eyes. Penetrated through and through by\na sense of duty, by the dread of hurting any one whatever, with a kind\nand tender heart, she had loved all men, and no one in particular; God\nonly she had! loved passionately, timidly, and tenderly. Lavretsky was\nthe first to break in upon her peaceful inner life.\n\nSuch was Lisa.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVI\n\n\nOn the following day at twelve o'clock, Lavretsky set off to the\nKalitins. On the way he met Panshin, who galloped past him on horseback,\nhis hat pulled down to his very eyebrows. At the Kalitins', Lavretsky\nwas not admitted for the first time since he had been acquainted with\nthem. Marya Dmitrievna was \"resting,\" so the footman informed him; her\nexcellency had a headache. Marfa Timofyevna and Lisaveta Mihalovna were\nnot at home. Lavretsky walked round the garden in the faint hope of\nmeeting Lisa, but he saw no one. He came back two hours later and\nreceived the same answer, accompanied by a rather dubious look from the\nfootman. Lavretsky thought it would be unseemly to call for a third time\nthe same day, and he decided to drive over to Vassilyevskoe, where he\nhad business moreover. On the road he made various plans for the future,\neach better than the last; but he was overtaken by a melancholy mood\nwhen he reached his aunt's little village. He fell into conversation!\nwith Anton; the old man, as if purposely, seemed full of cheerless\nfancies. He told Lavretsky how, at her death, Glafira Petrovna had\nbitten her own arm, and after a brief pause, added with a sigh: \"Every\nman, dear master, is destined to devour himself.\" It was late when\nLavretsky set off on the way back. He was haunted by the music of\nthe day before, and Lisa's image returned to him in all its sweet\ndistinctness; he mused with melting tenderness over the thought that she\nloved him, and reached his little house in the town, soothed and happy.\n\nThe first thing that struck him as he went into the entrance hall was\na scent of patchouli, always distasteful to him; there were some high\ntravelling-trunks standing there. The face of his groom, who ran out\nto meet him, seemed strange to him. Not stopping to analyse his\nimpressions, he crossed the threshold of the drawing room.... On his\nentrance there rose from the sofa a lady in a black silk dress with\nflounces, who, raising a cambric handkerchief to her pale face, made a\nfew paces forward, bent her carefully dressed, perfumed head, and fell\nat his feet.... Then, only, he recognised her: this lady was his wife!\n\nHe caught his breath.... He leaned against the wall.\n\n\"Theodore, do not repulse me!\" she said in French, and her voice cut to\nhis heart like a knife.\n\nHe looked at her senselessly, and yet he noticed involuntarily at once\nthat she had grown both whiter and fatter.\n\n\"Theodore!\" she went on, from time to time lifting her eyes and\ndiscreetly wringing her marvellously-beautiful fingers with their rosy,\npolished nails. \"Theodore, I have wronged you, deeply wronged you; I\nwill say more, I have sinned: but hear me; I am tortured by remorse, I\nhave grown hateful to myself, I could endure my position no longer; how\nmany times have I thought of turning to you, but I feared your anger;\nI resolved to break every tie with the past.... Puis j'ai ete si\nmalade.... I have been so ill,\" she added, and passed her hand over\nher brow and cheek. \"I took advantage of the widely-spread rumour of my\ndeath, I gave up everything; without resting day or night I hastened\nhither; I hesitated long to appear before you, my judge... paraitre\ndevant vous, mon juge; but I resolved at last, remembering your constant\ngoodness, to come to you; I found your address at Moscow. Believe me,\"\nshe went on, slowly getting up from the floor and sitting on the very!\nedge of an arm-chair, \"I have often thought of death, and I should have\nfound courage enough to take my life... ah! life is a burden unbearable\nfor me now!... but the thought of my daughter, my little Ada, stopped\nme. She is here, she is asleep in the next room, the poor child! She is\ntired--you shall see her; she at least has done you no wrong, and I am\nso unhappy, so unhappy!\" cried Madame Lavretsky, and she melted into\ntears.\n\nLavretsky came to himself at last; he moved away from the wall and\nturned towards the door.\n\n\"You are going?\" cried his wife in a voice of despair. \"Oh, this is\ncruel! Without uttering one word to me, not even a reproach. This\ncontempt will kill me, it is terrible!\"\n\nLavretsky stood still.\n\n\"What do you want to hear from me?\" he articulated in an expressionless\nvoice.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" she rejoined quickly, \"I know I have no right to\nexpect anything; I am not mad, believe me; I do not hope, I do not dare\nto hope for your forgiveness; I only venture to entreat you to command\nme what I am to do, where I am to live. Like a slave I will fulfil your\ncommands whatever they may be.\"\n\n\"I have no commands to give you,\" replied Lavretsky in the same\ncolourless voice; \"you know, all is over between us... and now more\nthan ever; you can live where you like; and if your allowance is too\nlittle--\"\n\n\"Ah, don't say such dreadful things,\" Varvara Pavlovna interrupted him,\n\"spare me, if only... if only for the sake of this angel.\" And as she\nuttered these words, Varvara Pavlovna ran impulsively into the next\nroom, and returned at once with a small and very elegantly dressed\nlittle girl in her arms.\n\nThick flaxen curls fell over her pretty rosy little face, and on to her\nlarge sleepy black eyes; she smiled and blinked her eyes at the light\nand laid a chubby little hand on her mother's neck.\n\n\"Ada, vois, c'est ton pere,\" said Varvara Pavlovna, pushing the curls\nback from her eyes and kissing her vigorously, \"pre le avec moi.\"\n\n\"C'est ca, papa?\" stammered the little girl lisping.\n\n\"Oui, mon enfant, n'est-ce pas que tu l'aimes?\"\n\nBut this was more than Lavretsky could stand.\n\n\"In such a melodrama must there really be a scene like this?\" he\nmuttered, and went out of the room.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna stood still for some time in the same place, slightly\nshrugged her shoulders, carried the little girl off into the next room,\nundressed her and put her to bed. Then she took up a book and sat down\nnear the lamp, and after staying up for an hour she went to bed herself.\n\n\"Eh bien, madame?\" queried her maid, a Frenchwoman whom she had brought\nfrom Paris, as she unlaced her corset.\n\n\"Eh bien, Justine,\" se replied, \"he is a good deal older, but I fancy he\nis just the same good-natured fellow. Give me my gloves for the night,\nand get out my grey high-necked dress for to-morrow, and don't forget\nthe mutton cutlets for Ada.... I daresay it will be difficult to get\nthem here; but we must try.\"\n\n\"A la guerre comme a la guerre,\" replied Justine as she put out the\ncandle.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVII\n\n\nFor more than two hours Lavretsky wandered about the streets of town.\nThe night he had spent in the outskirts of Paris returned to his mind.\nHis heart was bursting and his head, dull and stunned, was filled again\nwith the same dark senseless angry thoughts, constantly recurring. \"She\nis alive, she is here,\" he muttered with ever fresh amazement. He felt\nthat he had lost Lisa. His wrath choked him; this blow had fallen\ntoo suddenly upon him. How could he so readily have believed in the\nnonsensical gossip of a journal, a wretched scrap of paper? \"Well, if I\nhad not believed it,\" he thought, \"what difference would it have made?\nI should not have known that Lisa loved me; she would not have known it\nherself.\" He could not rid himself of the image, the voice, the eyes of\nhis wife... and he cursed himself, he cursed everything in the world.\n\nWearied out he went towards morning to Lemm's. For a long while he could\nmake no one hear; at last at a window the old man's head appeared in a\nnightcap, sour, wrinkled, and utterly unlike the inspired austere visage\nwhich twenty-four hours ago had looked down imperiously upon Lavretsky\nin all the dignity of artistic grandeur.\n\n\"What do you want?\" queried Lemm. \"I can't play to you every night, I\nhave taken a decoction for a cold.\" But Lavretsky's face, apparently,\nstruck him as strange; the old man made a shade for his eyes with his\nhand, took a look at his elated visitor, and let him in.\n\nLavretsky went into the room and sank into a chair. The old man\nstood still before him, wrapping the skirts of his shabby striped\ndressing-gown around him, shrinking together and gnawing his lips.\n\n\"My wife is here,\" Lavretsky brought out. He raised his head and\nsuddenly broke into involuntary laughter.\n\nLemm's face expressed bewilderment, but he did not even smile, only\nwrapped himself closer in his dressing-gown.\n\n\"Of course, you don't know,\" Lavretsky went on, \"I had imagined... I\nread in a paper that she was dead.\"\n\n\"O--oh, did you read that lately?\" asked Lemm.\n\n\"Yes, lately.\"\n\n\"O--oh,\" repeated the old man, raising his eyebrows. \"And she is here?\"\n\n\"Yes. She is at my house now; and I... I am an unlucky fellow.\"\n\nAnd he laughed again.\n\n\"You are an unlucky fellow,\" Lemm repeated slowly.\n\n\"Christopher Fedoritch,\" began Lavretsky, \"would you undertake to carry\na note for me?\"\n\n\"H'm. May I know to whom?\"\n\n\"Lisavet--\"\n\n\"Ah... yes, yes, I understand. Very good. And when must the letter be\nreceived?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, as early as possible.\"\n\n\"H'm. I can send Katrine, my cook. No, I will go myself.\"\n\n\"And you will bring me an answer?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will bring you an answer.\"\n\nLemm sighed.\n\n\"Yes, my poor young friend; you are certainly an unlucky young man.\"\n\nLavretsky wrote a few words to Lisa. He told her of his wife's arrival,\nbegged her to appoint a meeting with him,--then he flung himself on the\nnarrow sofa, with his face to the wall; and the old man lay down on\nthe bed, and kept muttering a long while, coughing and drinking off his\ndecoction by gulps.\n\nThe morning came; they both got up. With strange eyes they looked at\none another. At that moment Lavretsky longed to kill himself. The cook,\nKatrine, brought them some villainous coffee. It struck eight. Lemm\nput on his hat, and saying that he was going to give a lesson at the\nKalitins' at ten, but he could find a suitable pretext for going there\nnow, he set off. Lavretsky flung himself again on the little sofa, and\nonce more the same bitter laugh stirred in the depth of his soul. He\nthought of how his wife had driven him out of his house; he imagined\nLisa's position, covered his eyes and clasped his hands behind his head.\nAt last Lemm came back and brought him a scrap of paper, on which Lisa\nhad scribbled in pencil the following words: \"We cannot meet to-day;\nperhaps, to-morrow evening. Good-bye.\" Lavretsky thanked Lemm briefly\nand indifferently, and went home.\n\nHe found his wife at breakfast; Ada, in curl-papers, in a little white\nfrock with blue ribbons, was eating her mutton cutlet. Varvara Pavlovna\nrose at once directly Lavretsky entered the room, and went to meet him\nwith humility in her face. He asked her to follow him into the study,\nshut the door after them, and began to walk up and down; she sat\ndown, modestly laying one hand over the other, and began to follow his\nmovements with her eyes, which were still beautiful, though they were\npencilled lightly under their lids.\n\nFor some time Lavretsky could not speak; he felt that he could not\nmaster himself, he saw clearly that Varvara Pavlovna was not in the\nleast afraid of him, but was assuming an appearance of being ready to\nfaint away in another instant.\n\n\"Listen, madam,\" he began at last, breathing with difficulty and at\nmoments setting his teeth: \"it is useless for us to make pretense with\none another; I don't believe in your penitence; and even if it were\nsincere, to be with you again, to live with you, would be impossible for\nme.\"\n\nVarvara Pavlovna bit her lips and half-closed her eyes. \"It is\naversion,\" she thought; \"all is over; in his eyes I am not even a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" repeated Lavretsky, fastening the top buttons of his coat.\n\"I don't know what induced you to come here; I suppose you have come to\nthe end of your money.\"\n\n\"Ah! you hurt me!\" whispered Varvara Pavlovna.\n\n\"However that may be--you are, any way, my wife, unhappily. I cannot\ndrive you away... and this is the proposal I make you. You may to-day,\nif you like, set off to Lavriky, and live there; there is, as you know,\na good house there; you will have everything you need in addition to\nyour allowance... Do you agree?\"--Varvara Pavlovna raised an embroidered\nhandkerchief to her face.\n\n\"I have told you already,\" she said, her lips twitching nervously, \"that\nI will consent to whatever you think fit to do with me; at present it\nonly remains for me to beg of you--will you allow me at least to thank\nyou for your magnanimity?\"\n\n\"No thanks, I beg--it is better without that,\" Lavretsky said hurriedly.\n\"So then,\" he pursued, approaching the door, \"I may reckon on--\"\n\n\"To-morrow I will be at Lavriky,\" Varvara Pavlovna declared, rising\nrespectfully from her place. \"But Fedor Ivanitch--\" (She no longer\ncalled him \"Theodore.\")\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I know, I have not yet gained any right to forgiveness; may I hope at\nleast that with time--\"\n\n\"Ah, Varvara Pavlovna,\" Lavretsky broke in, \"you are a clever woman,\nbut I too am not a fool; I know that you don't want forgiveness in the\nleast. And I have forgiven you long ago; but there was always a great\ngulf between us.\"\n\n\"I know how to submit,\" rejoined Varvara Pavlovna, bowing her head. \"I\nhave not forgotten my sin; I should not have been surprised if I had\nlearnt that you even rejoiced at the news of my death,\" she added\nsoftly, slightly pointing with her hand to the copy of the journal which\nwas lying forgotten by Lavretsky on the table.\n\nFedor Ivanitch started; the paper had been marked in pencil. Varvara\nPavlovna gazed at him with still greater humility. She was superb at\nthat moment. Her grey Parisian gown clung gracefully round her supple,\nalmost girlish figure; her slender, soft neck, encircled by a white\ncollar, her bosom gently stirred by her even breathing, her hands\ninnocent of bracelets and rings--her whole figure, from her shining hair\nto the tip of her just visible little shoe, was so artistic...\n\nLavretsky took her in with a glance of hatred; scarcely could he refrain\nfrom crying: \"Bravo!\" scarcely could he refrain from felling her with a\nblow of his fist on her shapely head--and he turned on his heel. An\nhour later he had started for Vassilyevskoe, and two hours later Varvara\nPavlovna had bespoken the best carriage in the town, had put on a simple\nstraw hat with a black veil, and a modest mantle, given Ada into the\ncharge of Justine, and set off to the Kalitins'. From the inquiries she\nhad made among the servants, she had learnt that her husband went to see\nthem every day.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXVIII\n\n\nThe day of the arrival of Lavretsky's wife at the town of O-----, a\nsorrowful day for him, and been also a day of misery for Lisa. She had\nnot had time to go down-stairs and say good-morning to her mother, when\nthe tramp of hoofs was heard under the window, and with a secret dismay\nshe saw Panshin riding into the courtyard. \"He has come so early for a\nfinal explanation,\" she thought, and she was not mistaken. After a turn\nin the drawing-room, he suggested that she should go with him into the\ngarden, and then asked her for the decision of his fate. Lisa summoned\nup all her courage and told him that she could not be his wife. He heard\nher to the end, standing on one side of her and pulling his hat down\nover his forehead; courteously, but in a changed voice, he asked her,\n\"Was this her last word, and had he given her any ground for such a\nchange in her views?\"--then pressed his hand to his eyes, sighed softly\nand abruptly, and took his head away from his face again.\n\n\"I did not want to go along the beaten track,\" he said huskily. \"I\nwanted to choose a wife according to the dictates of my heart; but it\nseems this was not to be. Farewell, fond dream!\" He made Lisa a profound\nbow, and went back into the house.\n\nShe hoped that he would go away at once; but he went into Marya\nDmitrievna's room and remained nearly an hour with her. As he came out,\nhe said to Lisa: \"Votre mere vous appelle; adieu a jamais,\"... mounted\nhis horse, and set off at full trot from the very steps. Lisa went in to\nMarya Dmitrievna and found her in tears; Panshin had informed her of his\nill-luck.\n\n\"Do you want to be the death of me? Do you want to be the death of me?\"\nwas how the disconsolate widow began her lamentations. \"Whom do you\nwant? Wasn't he good enough for you? A kammer-junker! not interesting!\nHe might have married any Maid of Honour he liked in Petersburg. And\nI--I had so hoped for it! Is it long that you have changed towards him?\nHow has this misfortune come on us,--it cannot have come of itself! Is\nit that dolt of a cousin's doing? A nice person you have picked up to\nadvise you!\"\n\n\"And he, poor darling,\" Marya Dmitrievna went on, \"how respectful he is,\nhow attentive even in his sorrow! He has promised not to desert me. Ah,\nI can never bear that! Ah, my head aches fit to split! Send me Palashka.\nYou will be the death of me, if you don't think better of it,--do you\nhear?\"\n\nAnd, calling her twice an ungrateful girl, Marya Dmitrievna dismissed\nher.\n\nShe went to her own room. But she had not had time to recover from her\ninterviews with Panshin and her mother before another storm broke over\nhead, and this time from a quarter from which she would least have\nexpected it. Marfa Timofyevna came into her room, and at once slammed\nthe door after her. The old lady's face was pale, her cap was awry,\nher eyes were flashing, and her hands and lips were trembling. Lisa was\nastonished; she had never before seen her sensible and reasonable aunt\nin such a condition.\n\n\"A pretty thing, miss,\" Marfa Timofyevna began in a shaking and broken\nwhisper, \"a pretty thing! Who taught you such ways, I should like to\nknow, miss?... Give me some water; I can't speak.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, auntie, what is the matter?\" said Lisa, giving her a\nglass of water. \"Why, I thought you did not think much of Mr. Panshin\nyourself.\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna pushed away the glass.\n\n\"I can't drink; I shall knock my last teeth out if I try to. What's\nPanshin to do with it? Why bring Panshin in? You had better tell me who\nhas taught you to make appointments at night--eh? miss?\"\n\nLisa turned pale.\n\n\"Now, please, don't try to deny it,\" pursued Marfa Timofyevna;\n\"Shurotchka herself saw it all and told me. I have had to forbid her\nchattering, but she is not a liar.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it, auntie,\" Lisa uttered scarcely audibly.\n\n\"Ah, ah! That's it, is it, miss; you made an appointment with him, that\nold sinner, who seems so meek?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How then?\"\n\n\"I went down into the drawing-room for a book; he was in the garden--and\nhe called me.\"\n\n\"And you went? A pretty thing! So you love him, eh?\"\n\n\"I love him,\" answered Lisa softly.\n\n\"Merciful Heavens! She loves him!\" Marfa Timofyevna snatched off her\ncap. \"She loves a married man! Ah! she loves him.\"\n\n\"He told me\"...began Lisa.\n\n\"What has he told you, the scoundrel, eh?\"\n\n\"He told me that his wife was dead.\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna crossed herself. \"Peace be with her,\" she muttered;\n\"she was a vain hussy, God forgive her. So, then, he's a widower, I\nsuppose. And he's losing no time, I see. He has buried one wife and now\nhe's after another. He's a nice person: only let me tell you one thing,\nniece; in my day, when I was young, harm came to young girls from such\ngoings on. Don't be angry with me, my girl, only fools are angry at the\ntruth. I have given orders not to admit him to-day. I love him, but I\nshall never forgive him for this. Upon my word, a widower! Give me\nsome water. But as for your sending Panshin about his business, I think\nyou're a first-rate girl for that. Only don't you go sitting of nights\nwith any animals of that sort; don't break my old heart, or else you'll\nsee I'm not all fondness--I can bite too... a widower!\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna went off, and Lisa sat down in a corner and began\nto cry. There was bitterness in her soul. She had not deserved such\nhumiliation. Love had proved no happiness to her: she was weeping for\na second time since yesterday evening. This new unexpected feeling had\nonly just arisen in her heart, and already what a heavy price she had\npaid for it, how coarsely had strange hands touched her sacred secret.\nShe felt ashamed, and bitter, and sick; but she had no doubt and no\ndread--and Lavretsky was dearer to her than ever. She had hesitated\nwhile she did not understand herself; but after that meeting, after that\nkiss--she could hesitate no more: she knew that she loved, and now she\nloved honestly and seriously, she was bound firmly for all her life,\nand she did not fear reproaches. She felt that by no violence could they\nbreak that bond.\n\n\n\nChapter XXXIX\n\n\nMarya Dmitrievna was much agitated when she received the announcement of\nthe arrival of Varvara Pavlovna Lavretsky, she did not even know whether\nto receive her; she was afraid of giving offence to Fedor Ivanitch. At\nlast curiosity prevailed. \"Why,\" she reflected, \"she too is a relation,\"\nand, taking up her position in an arm-chair, she said to the footman,\n\"Show her in.\" A few moments passed; the door opened, Varvara Pavlovna\nswiftly and with scarcely audible steps, approached Marya Dmitrievna,\nand not allowing her to rise from her chair, bent almost on her knees\nbefore her.\n\n\"I thank you, dear aunt,\" she began in a soft voice full of emotion,\nspeaking Russian; \"I thank you; I did not hope for such condescension on\nyour part; you are an angel of goodness.\"\n\nAs she uttered these words Varvara Pavlovna quite unexpectedly took\npossession of one of Marya Dmitrievna's hands, and pressing it lightly\nin her pale lavender gloves, she raised it in a fawning way to her full\nrosy lips. Marya Dmitrievna quite lost her head, seeing such a handsome\nand charmingly dressed woman almost at her feet. She did not know where\nshe was. And she tried to withdraw her hand, while, at the same time,\nshe was inclined to make her sit down, and to say something affectionate\nto her. She ended by raising Varvara Pavlovna and kissing her on her\nsmooth perfumed brow.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna was completely overcome by this kiss.\n\n\"How do you do, bonjour,\" said Marya Dmitrievna. \"Of course I did not\nexpect... but, of course, I am glad to see you. You understand, my dear,\nit's not for me to judge between man and wife\"...\n\n\"My husband is in the right in everything,\" Varvara Pavlovna interposed;\n\"I alone am to blame.\"\n\n\"That is a very praiseworthy feeling\" rejoined Marya Dmitrievna, \"very.\nHave you been here long? Have you seen him? But sit down, please.\"\n\n\"I arrived yesterday,\" answered Varvara Pavlovna, sitting down meekly.\n\"I have seen Fedor Ivanitch; I have talked with him.\"\n\n\"Ah! Well, and how was he?\"\n\n\"I was afraid my sudden arrival would provoke his anger,\" continued\nVarvara Pavlovna, \"but he did not refuse to see me.\"\n\n\"That is to say, he did not... Yes, yes, I understand,\" commented Marya\nDmitrievna. \"He is only a little rough on the surface, but his heart is\nsoft.\"\n\n\"Fedor Ivanitch has not forgiven me; he would not hear me. But he was so\ngood as to assign me Lavriky as a place of residence.\"\n\n\"Ah! a splendid estate!\"\n\n\"I am setting off there to-morrow in fulfilment of his wish; but I\nesteemed it a duty to visit you first.\"\n\n\"I am very, very much obliged to you, my dear. Relations ought never to\nforget one another. And do you know I am surprised how well you speak\nRussian. C'est etonnant.\"\n\nVarvara Pavlovna sighed.\n\n\"I have been too long abroad, Marya Dmitrievna, I know that; but my\nheart has always been Russian, and I have not forgotten my country.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah; that is good. Fedor Ivanitch did not, however, expect you at\nall. Yes; you may trust my experience, la patri avant tout. Ah, show me,\nif you please-what a charming mantle you have.\"\n\n\"Do you like it?\" Varvara Pavlovna slipped it quickly off her shoulders;\n\"it is a very simple little thing from Madame Baudran.\"\n\n\"One can see it at once. From Madame Baudran? How sweet, and what taste!\nI am sure you have brought a number of fascinating things with you. If I\ncould only see them.\"\n\n\"All my things are at your service, dearest auntie. If you permit, I can\nshow some patterns to your maid. I have a woman with me from Paris--a\nwonderfully clever dressmaker.\"\n\n\"You are very good, my dear. But, really, I am ashamed\"...\n\n\"Ashamed!\" repeated Varvara Pavlovna reproachfully. \"If you want to make\nme happy, dispose of me as if I were your property.\"\n\nMarya Dmitrievna was completely melted.\n\n\"Vous etes charmante,\" she said. \"But why don't you take off your hat\nand gloves?\"\n\n\"What? you will allow me?\" asked Varvara Pavlovna, and slightly, as\nthough with emotion, clasped her hands.\n\n\"Of course, you will dine with us, I hope. I--I will introduce you to my\ndaughter.\" Marya Dmitrievna was a little confused. \"Well! we are in for\nit! here goes!\" she thought. \"She is not very well to-day.\"\n\n\"O ma tante, how good you are!\" cried Varvara Pavlovna, and she raised\nher handkerchief to her eyes.\n\nA page announced the arrival of Gedeonovsky. The old gossip came in\nbowing and smiling. Marya Dmitrievna presented him to her visitor. He\nwas thrown into confusion for the first moment; but Varvara Pavlovna\nbehaved with such coquettish respectfulness to him, that his ears began\nto tingle, and gossip, slander, and civility dropped like honey from his\nlips. Varvara Pavlovna listened to him with a restrained smile and began\nby degrees to talk herself. She spoke modestly of Paris, of her travels,\nof Baden; twice she made Marya Dmitrievna laugh, and each time she\nsighed a little afterwards, and seemed to be inwardly reproaching\nherself for misplaced levity. She obtained permission to bring Ada;\ntaking off her gloves, with her smooth hands, redolent of soap a la\nguimauve, she showed how and where flounces were worn and ruches and\nlace and rosettes. She promised to bring a bottle of the new English\nscent, Victoria Essence; and was as happy as a child when Marya\nDmitrievna consented to accept it as a gift. She was moved to tears over\nthe recollection of the emotion she experienced, when, for the first\ntime, she heard the Russian bells. \"They went so deeply to my heart,\"\nshe explained.\n\nAt that instant Lisa came in.\n\nEver since the morning, from the very instant when, chill with horror,\nshe had read Lavretsky's note, Lisa had been preparing herself for the\nmeeting with his wife. She had a presentiment that she would see her.\nShe resolved not to avoid her, as a punishment of her, as she called\nthem, sinful hopes. The sudden crisis in her destiny had shaken her to\nthe foundations. In some two hours her face seemed to have grown thin.\nBut she did not shed a single tear. \"It's what I deserve!\" she said to\nherself, repressing with difficulty and dismay some bitter impulses of\nhatred which frightened her in her soul. \"Well, I must go down!\" she\nthought directly she heard of Madame Lavretsky's arrival, and she went\ndown.... She stood a long while at the drawing-room door before she\ncould summon up courage to open it. With the thought, \"I have done her\nwrong,\" she crossed the threshold and forced herself to look at her,\nforced herself to smile. Varvara Pavlovna went to meet her directly she\ncaught sight of her, and bowed to her slightly, but still respectfully.\n\"Allow me to introduce myself,\" she began in an insinuating voice, \"your\nmaman is so indulgent to me that I hope that you too will be... good\nto me.\" The expression of Varvara Pavlovna, when she uttered these\nlast words, cold and at the same time soft, her hypocritical smile, the\naction of her hands, and her shoulders, her very dress, her whole being\naroused such a feeling of repulsion in Lisa that she could make no reply\nto her, and only held out her hand with an effort. \"This young lady\ndisdains me,\" thought Varvara Pavlovna, warmly pressing Lisa's cold\nfingers, and turning to Marya Dmitrievna, she observed in an undertone,\n\"mais elle est delicieuse!\" Lisa faintly flushed; she heard ridicule,\ninsult in this exclamation. But she resolved not to trust her\nimpressions, and sat down by the window at her embroidery-frame. Even\nhere Varvara Pavlovna did not leave her in peace. She began to admire\nher taste, her skill.... Lisa's heart beat violently and painfully. She\ncould scarcely control herself, she could scarcely sit in her place. It\nseemed to her that Varvara Pavlovna knew all, and was mocking at her\nin secret triumph. To her relief, Gedeonovsky began to talk to Varvara\nPavlovna, and drew off her attention. Lisa bent over her frame, and\nsecretly watched her. \"That woman,\" she thought, \"was loved by him.\" But\nshe at once drove away the very thought of Lavretsky; she was afraid of\nlosing her control over herself, she felt that her head was going round.\nMarya Dmitrievna began to talk of music.\n\n\"I have heard, my dear,\" she began, \"that you are a wonderful\nperformer.\"\n\n\"It is long since I have played,\" replied Varvara Pavlovna, seating\nherself without delay at the piano, and running her fingers smartly over\nthe keys. \"Do you wish it?\"\n\n\"If you will be so kind.\"\n\nVarvara Pavlovna played a brilliant and difficult etude by Hertz very\ncorrectly. She had great power and execution.\n\n\"Sylphide!\" cried Gedeonovsky.\n\n\"Marvellous!\" Marya Dmitrievna chimed in. \"Well, Varvara Pavlovna, I\nconfess,\" she observed, for the first time calling her by her name, \"you\nhave astonished me; you might give concerts. We have a musician here,\nan old German, a queer fellow, but a very clever musician. He gives Lisa\nlessons. He will be simply crazy over you.\"\n\n\"Lisaveta Mihalovna is also musical?\" asked Varvara Pavlovna, turning\nher head slightly towards her.\n\n\"Yes, she plays fairly, and is fond of music; but what is that beside\nyou? But there is one young man here too--with whom we must make you\nacquainted. He is an artist in soul, and composes very charmingly. He\nalone will be able to appreciate you fully.\"\n\n\"A young man?\" said Varvara Pavlovna: \"Who is he? Some poor man?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no, our chief beau, and not only among us--et a Petersbourg. A\nkammer-junker, and received in the best society. You must have heard of\nhim: Panshin, Vladimir Nikolaitch. He is here on a government commission\n... future minister, I daresay!\"\n\n\"And an artist?\"\n\n\"An artist at heart, and so well-bred. You shall see him. He has been\nhere very often of late: I invited him for this evening; I hope he will\ncome,\" added Marya Dmitrievna with a gentle sigh, and an oblique smile\nof bitterness.\n\nLisa knew the meaning of this smile, but it was nothing to her now.\n\n\"And young?\" repeated Varvara Pavlovna, lightly modulating from tone to\ntone.\n\n\"Twenty-eight, and of the most prepossessing appearance. Un jeune homme\nacompli, indeed.\"\n\n\"An exemplary young man, one may say,\" observed Gedeonovsky.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna began suddenly playing a noisy waltz of Strauss,\nopening with such a loud and rapid trill that Gedeonovsky was quite\nstartled. In the very middle of the waltz she suddenly passed into a\npathetic motive, and finished up with an air from \"Lucia\" Fra poco...\nShe reflected that lively music was not in keeping with her position.\nThe air from \"Lucia,\" with emphasis on the sentimental passages, moved\nMarya Dmitrievna greatly.\n\n\"What soul!\" she observed in an undertone to Gedeonovsky.\n\n\"A sylphide!\" repeated Gedeonovsky, raising his eyes towards heaven.\n\nThe dinner hour arrived. Marfa Timofyevna came down from up-stairs, when\nthe soup was already on the table. She treated Varvara Pavlovna very\ndrily, replied in half-sentences to her civilities, and did not look at\nher. Varvara Pavlovna soon realised that there was nothing to be got\nout of this old lady, and gave up trying to talk to her. To make up\nfor this, Marya Dmitrievna became still more cordial to her guest; her\naunt's discourtesy irritated her. Marfa Timofyevna, however, did not\nonly avoid looking at Varvara Pavlovna; she did not look at Lisa either,\nthough her eyes seemed literally blazing. She sat as though she were\nof stone, yellow and pale, her lips compressed, and ate nothing. Lisa\nseemed calm; and in reality, her heart was more at rest, a strange\napathy, the apathy of the condemned had come upon her. At dinner Varvara\nPavlovna spoke little; she seemed to have grown timid again, and her\ncountenance was overspread with an expression of modest melancholy.\nGedeonovsky alone enlivened the conversation with his tales, though he\nconstantly looked timorously towards Marfa Timofyevna and coughed--he\nwas always overtaken by a fit of coughing when he was going to tell a\nlie in her presence--but she did not hinder him by any interruption.\nAfter dinner it seemed that Varvara Pavlovna was quite devoted to\npreference; at this Marya Dmitrievna was so delighted that she felt\nquite overcome, and thought to herself, \"Really, what a fool Fedor\nIvanitch must be; not able to appreciate a woman like this!\"\n\nShe sat down to play cards together with her and Gedeonovsky, and Marfa\nTimofyevna led Lisa away up-stairs with her, saying that she looked\nshocking, and that she must certainly have a headache.\n\n\"Yes, she has an awful headache,\" observed Marya Dmitrievna, turning to\nVarvara Pavlovna and rolling her eyes, \"I myself have often just such\nsick headaches.\"\n\n\"Really!\" rejoined Varvara Pavlovna.\n\nLisa went into her aunt's room, and sank powerless into a chair. Marfa\nTimofyevna gazed long at her in silence, slowly she knelt down before\nher--and began still in the same silence to kiss her hands alternately.\nLisa bent forward, crimsoning--and began to weep, but she did not make\nMarfa Timofyevna get up, she did not take away her hands, she felt that\nshe had not the right to take them away, that she had not the right to\nhinder the old lady from expressing her penitence, and her sympathy,\nfrom begging forgiveness for what had passed the day before. And Marfa\nTimofyevna could not kiss enough those poor, pale, powerless hands, and\nsilent tears flowed from her eyes and from Lisa's; while the cat Matross\npurred in the wide arm-chair among the knitting wool, and the long\nflame of the little lamp faintly stirred and flickered before the holy\npicture. In the next room, behind the door, stood Nastasya Karpovna, and\nshe too was furtively wiping her eyes with her check pocket-handkerchief\nrolled up in a ball.\n\nChapter XL\n\n\nMeanwhile, down-stairs, preference was going on merrily in the\ndrawing-room; Marya Dmitrievna was winning, and was in high good-humour.\nA servant came in and announced that Panshin was below.\n\nMarya Dmitrievna dropped her cards and moved restlessly in her\narm-chair; Varvara Pavlovna looked at her with a half-smile, then\nturned her eyes towards the door. Panshin made his appearance in a black\nfrock-coat buttoned up to the throat, and a high English collar. \"It\nwas hard for me to obey; but you see I have come,\" this was what was\nexpressed by his unsmiling, freshly shaven countenance.\n\n\"Well, Woldemar,\" cried Marya Dmitrievna, \"you used to come in\nunannounced!\"\n\nPanshin only replied to Marya Dmitrievna by a single glance. He bowed\ncourteously to her, but did not kiss her hand. She presented him to\nVarvara Pavlovna; he stepped back a pace, bowed to her with the same\ncourtesy, but with still greater elegance and respect, and took a seat\nnear the card-table. The game of preference was soon over. Panshin\ninquired after Lisaveta Mihalovna, learnt that she was not quite well,\nand expressed his regret. Then he began to talk to Varvara Pavlovna,\ndiplomatically weighing each word and giving it its full value,\nand politely hearing her answers to the end. But the dignity of his\ndiplomatic tone did not impress Varvara Pavlovna, and she did not adopt\nit. On the contrary, she looked him in the face with light-hearted\nattention and talked easily, while her delicate nostrils were quivering\nas though with suppressed laughter. Marya Dmitrievna began to enlarge on\nher talent; Panshin courteously inclined his head, so far as his collar\nwould permit him, declared that, \"he felt sure of it beforehand,\" and\nalmost turned the conversation to the diplomatic topic of Metternich\nhimself. Varvara Pavlovna, with an expressive look in her velvety eyes,\nsaid in a low voice, \"Why, but you too are an artist, un confrere,\"\nadding still lower, \"venez!\" with a nod towards the piano. The single\nword venez thrown at him, instantly, as though by magic, effected a\ncomplete transformation in Panshin's whole appearance. His care-worn\nair disappeared; he smiled and grew lively, unbuttoned his coat, and\nrepeating \"a poor artist, alas! Now you, I have heard, are a real\nartist; he followed Varvara Pavlovna to the piano....\n\n\"Make him sing his song, 'How the Moon Floats,'\" cried Marya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"Do you sing?\" said Varvara Pavlovna, enfolding him in a rapid radiant\nlook. \"Sit down.\"\n\nPanshin began to cry off.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she repeated insistently, tapping on a chair behind him.\n\nHe sat down, coughed, tugged at his collar, and sang his song.\n\n\"Charmant,\" pronounced Varvara Pavlovna, \"you sing very well, vous avez\ndu style, again.\"\n\nShe walked round the piano and stood just opposite Panshin. He sang it\nagain, increasing the melodramatic tremor in his voice. Varvara Pavlovna\nstared steadily at him, leaning her elbows on the piano and holding her\nwhite hands on a level with her lips. Panshin finished the song.\n\n\"Charmant, charmant idee,\" she said with the calm self-confidence of a\nconnoisseur. \"Tell me, have you composed anything for a woman's voice,\nfor a mezzo-soprano?\"\n\n\"I hardly compose at all,\" replied Panshin. \"That was only thrown off in\nthe intervals of business... but do you sing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh! sing us something,\" urged Marya Dmitrievna.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna pushed her hair back off her glowing cheeks and gave\nher head a little shake.\n\n\"Our voices ought to go well together,\" she observed, turning to\nPanshin; \"let us sing a duet. Do you know Son geloso, or La ci darem or\nMira la bianca luna?\"\n\n\"I used to sing Mira la bianca luna, once,\" replied Panshin, \"but long\nago; I have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Never mind, we will rehearse it in a low voice. Allow me.\"\n\nVarvara Pavlovna sat down at the piano, Panshin stood by her. They sang\nthrough the duet in an undertone, and Varvara Pavlovna corrected him\nseveral times as they did so, then they sang it aloud, and then twice\nrepeated the performance of Mira la bianca lu-u-na. Varvara Pavlovna's\nvoice had lost its freshness, but she managed it with great skill.\nPanshin at first was hesitating, and a little out of tune, then he\nwarmed up, and if his singing was not quite beyond criticism, at least\nhe shrugged his shoulders, swayed his whole person, and lifted his hand\nfrom time to time in the most genuine style. Varvara Pavlovna played two\nor three little things of Thalberg's, and coquettishly rendered a little\nFrench ballad. Marya Dmitrievna did not know how to express her delight;\nshe several times tried to send for Lisa. Gedeonovsky, too, was at a\nloss for words, and could only nod his head, but all at once he gave an\nunexpected yawn, and hardly had time to cover his mouth with his! hand.\nThis yawn did not escape Varvara Pavlovna; she at once turned her back\non the piano, observing, \"Assez de musique comme ca; let us talk,\" and\nshe folded her arms. \"Oui, assez de musique,\" repeated Panshin gaily,\nand at once he dropped into a chat, alert, light, and in French.\n\"Precisely as in the best Parisian salon,\" thought Marya Dmitrievna, as\nshe listened to their fluent and quick-witted sentences. Panshin had a\nsense of complete satisfaction; his eyes shone, and he smiled. At first\nhe passed his hand across his face, contracted his brows, and sighed\nspasmodically whenever he chanced to encounter Marya Dmitrievna's eyes.\nBut later on he forgot her altogether, and gave himself up entirely to\nthe enjoyment of a half-worldly, half-artistic chat. Varvara Pavlovna\nproved to be a great philosopher; she had a ready answer for everything;\nshe never hesitated, never doubted about anything; one could see that\nshe had conversed much with clever men of all kinds. All her ideas, all\nher feelings revolved round Paris. Panshin turned the conversation upon\nliterature; it seemed that, like himself, she read only French books.\nGeorge Sand drove her to exasperation, Balzac she respected, but he\nwearied her; in Sue and Scribe she saw great knowledge of human nature,\nDumas and Feval she adored. In her heart she preferred Paul de Kock to\nall of them, but of course she did not even mention his name. To tell\nthe truth, literature had no great interest for her. Varvara Pavlovna\nvery skilfully avoided all that could even remotely recall her position;\nthere was no reference to love in her remarks; on the contrary, they\nwere rather expressive of austerity in regard to the allurements of\npassion, of disillusionment and resignation. Panshin disputed with her;\nshe did not agree with him.... but, strange to say!... at the very time\nwhen words of censure-often of severe censure--were coming from her\nlips, these words had a soft caressing sound, and her eyes spoke...\nprecisely what those lovely eyes spoke, it was hard to say; but at least\ntheir utterances were anything but severe, and were full of undefined\nsweetness.\n\nPanshin tried to interpret their secret meaning, he tried to make his\nown eyes speak, but he felt he was not successful; he was conscious that\nVarvara Pavlovna, in the character of a real lioness from abroad, stood\nhigh above him, and consequently was not completely master of himself.\nVarvara Pavlovna had a habit in conversation of lightly touching the\nsleeve of the person she was talking to; those momentary contacts had\na most disquieting influence on Vladimir Nikolaitch. Varvara Pavlovna\npossessed the faculty of getting on easily with every one; before two\nhours had passed it seemed to Panshin that he had known her for an age,\nand Lisa, the same Lisa whom, at any-rate, he had loved, to whom he\nhad the evening before offered his hand, had vanished as it were into\na mist. Tea was brought in; the conversation became still more\nunconstrained. Marya Dmitrievna rang for the page and gave orders to ask\nLisa to come down if her head were better. Panshin, hearing Lisa's\nname, fell to discussing self-sacrifice and the question which was more\ncapable of sacrifice--man or woman. Marya Dmitrievna at once became\nexcited, began to maintain that woman is more the ready for sacrifice,\ndeclared that she would prove it in a couple of words, got confused and\nfinished up by a rather unfortunate comparison. Varvara Pavlovna took up\na music-book and half-hiding behind it and bending towards Panshin, she\nobserved in a whisper, as she nibbled a biscuit, with a serene smile\non her lips and in her eyes, \"Elle n'a pas invente la poudre, la bonne\ndame.\" Panshin was a little taken aback and amazed at Varvara Pavlovna's\naudacity; but he did not realise how much contempt for himself was\nconcealed in this unexpected outbreak, and forgetting Marya Dmitrievna's\nkindness and devotion, forgetting all the dinners she had given him, and\nthe money she had lent him, he replied (luckless mortal!) with the same\nsmile and in the same tone, \"je crois bien,\" and not even, je crois\nbien, but j'crois ben!\n\nVarvara flung him a friendly glance and got up. Lisa came in: Marfa\nTimofyevna had tried in vain to hinder her; she was resolved to go\nthrough with her sufferings to the end. Varvara Pavlovna went to\nmeet her together with Panshin, on whose face the former diplomatic\nexpression had reappeared.\n\n\"How are you?\" he asked Lisa.\n\n\"I am better now, thank you,\" she replied.\n\n\"We have been having a little music here; it's a pity you did not hear\nVarvara Pavlovna, she sings superbly, en artiste consommee.\"\n\n\"Come here, my dear,\" sounded Marya Dmitrievna's voice.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna went to her at once with the submissiveness of a child,\nand sat down on a little stool at her feet. Marya Dmitrievna had called\nher so as to leave her daughter, at least for a moment, alone with\nPanshin; she was still secretly hoping that she would come round.\nBesides, an idea had entered her head, to which she was anxious to give\nexpression at once.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she whispered to Varvara Pavlovna, \"I want to endeavour\nto reconcile you and your husband; I won't answer for my success, but I\nwill make an effort. He has, you know, a great respect for me.\" Varvara\nPavlovna slowly raised her eyes to Marya Dmitrievna, and eloquently\nclasped her hands.\n\n\"You would be my saviour, ma tante,\" she said in a mournful voice: \"I\ndon't know how to thank you for all your kindness; but I have been too\nguilty towards Fedor Ivanitch; he can not forgive me.\"\n\n\"But did you--in reality--\" Marya Dmitrievna was beginning\ninquisitively.\n\n\"Don't question me,\" Varvara Pavlovna interrupted her, and she cast down\nher eyes. \"I was young, frivolous. But I don't want to justify myself.\"\n\n\"Well, anyway, why not try? Don't despair,\" rejoined Marya Dmitrievna,\nand she was on the point of patting her on the cheek, but after a\nglance at her she had not the courage. \"She is humble, very humble,\" she\nthought, \"but still she is a lioness.\"\n\n\"Are you ill?\" Panshin was saying to Lisa meanwhile.\n\n\"Yes, I am not well.\"\n\n\"I understand you,\" he brought out after a rather protracted silence.\n\"Yes, I understand you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I understand you,\" Panshin repeated significantly; he simply did not\nknow what to say.\n\nLisa felt embarrassed, and then \"so be it!\" she thought. Panshin assumed\na mysterious air and kept silent, looking severely away.\n\n\"I fancy though it's struck eleven,\" remarked Marya Dmitrievna.\n\nHer guests took the hint and began to say good-bye. Varvara Pavlovna\nhad to promise that she would come to dinner the following day and bring\nAda. Gedeonovsky, who had all but fallen asleep sitting in his corner,\noffered to escort her home. Panshin took leave solemnly of all, but at\nthe steps as he put Varvara Pavlovna into her carriage he pressed her\nhand, and cried after her, \"au revoir!\" Gedeonovsky sat beside her all\nthe way home. She amused herself by pressing the tip of her little foot\nas though accidentally on his foot; he was thrown into confusion and\nbegan paying her compliments. She tittered and made eyes at him when the\nlight of a street lamp fell into the carriage. The waltz she had played\nwas ringing in her head, and exciting her; whatever position she might\nfind herself in, she had only to imagine lights, a ballroom, rapid\nwhirling to the strains of music--and her blood was on fire, her eyes\nglittered strangely, a smile strayed about her lips, and something of\nbacchanalian grace was visible over her whole frame. When she reached\nhome Varvara Pavlovna bounded lightly out of the carriage--only real\nlionesses know how to bound like that--and turning round to Gedeonovsky\nshe burst suddenly into a ringing laugh right in his face.\n\n\"An attractive person,\" thought the counsellor of state as he made his\nway to his lodgings, where his servant was awaiting him with a glass of\nopodeldoc: \"It's well I'm a steady fellow--only, what was she laughing\nat?\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna spent the whole night sitting beside Lisa's bed.\n\n\n\nChapter XLI\n\n\nLavretsky spent a day and a half at Vassilyevskoe, and employed almost\nall the time in wandering about the neighbourhood. He could not stop\nlong in one place: he was devoured by anguish; he was torn unceasingly\nby impotent violent impulses. He remembered the feeling which had\ntaken possession of him the day after his arrival in the country; he\nremembered his plans then and was intensely exasperated with himself.\nWhat had been able to tear him away from what he recognised as his\nduty--as the one task set before him in the future? The thirst for\nhappiness--again the same thirst for happiness.\n\n\"It seems Mihalevitch was right,\" he thought; \"you wanted a second time\nto taste happiness in life,\" he said to himself, \"you forgot that it is\na luxury, an undeserved bliss, if it even comes once to a man. It was\nnot complete, it was not genuine, you say; but prove your right to full,\ngenuine happiness Look round and see who is happy, who enjoys life about\nyou? Look at that peasant going to the mowing; is he contented with his\nfate?... What! would you care to change places with him? Remember your\nmother; how infinitely little she asked of life, and what a life fell to\nher lot. You were only bragging it seems when you said to Panshin that\nyou had come back to Russia to cultivate the soil; you have come back\nto dangle after young girls in your old age. Directly the news of your\nfreedom came, you threw up everything, forgot everything; you ran like a\nboy after a butterfly.\"....\n\nThe image of Lisa continually presented itself in the midst of his\nbroodings. He drove it away with an effort together with another\nimportunate figure, other serenely wily, beautiful, hated features. Old\nAnton noticed that the master was not himself: after sighing several\ntimes outside the door and several times in the doorway, he made up his\nmind to go up to him, and advised him to take a hot drink of something.\nLavretsky swore at him; ordered him out; afterwards he begged his\npardon, but that only made Anton still more sorrowful. Lavretsky\ncould not stay in the drawing-room; it seemed to him that his\ngreat-grandfather Andrey, was looking contemptuously from the canvas at\nhis feeble descendant. \"Bah: you swim in shallow water,\" the distorted\nlips seemed to be saying. \"Is it possible,\" he thought, \"that I cannot\nmaster myself, that I am going to give in to this... nonsense?\" (Those\nwho are badly wounded in war always call their wounds \"nonsense.\" If\nman did not deceive himself, he could not live on earth.) \"Am I really\na boy? Ah, well; I saw quite close, I almost held in my hands the\npossibility of happiness for my whole life; yes, in the lottery\ntoo--turn the wheel a little and the beggar perhaps would be a rich man.\nIf it does not happen, then it does not--and it's all over. I will set\nto work, with my teeth clenched, and make myself be quiet; it's as well,\nit's not the first time I have had to hold myself in. And why have I\nrun away, why am I stopping here sticking my head in a bush, like an\nostrich? A fearful thing to face trouble... nonsense! Anton,\" he called\naloud, \"order the coach to be brought round at once. Yes,\" he thought\nagain, \"I must grin and bear it, I must keep myself well in hand.\"\n\nWith such reasonings Lavretsky tried to ease his pain; but it was deep\nand intense; and even Apraxya who had outlived all emotion as well as\nintelligence shook her head and followed him mournfully with her eyes,\nas he took his seat in the coach to drive to the town. The horses\ngalloped away; he sat upright and motionless, and looked fixedly at the\nroad before him.\n\n\n\nChapter XLII\n\n\nLisa had written to Lavretsky the day before, to tell him to come in the\nevening; but he first went home to his lodgings. He found neither his\nwife nor his daughter at home; from the servants he learned that she\nhad gone with the child to the Kalitins'. This information astounded and\nmaddened him. \"Varvara Pavlovna has made up her mind not to let me live\nat all, it seems,\" he thought with a passion of hatred in his heart.\nHe began to walk up and down, and his hands and feet were constantly\nknocking up against child's toys, books and feminine belongings; he\ncalled Justine and told her to clear away all this \"litter.\" \"Oui,\nmonsieur,\" she said with a grimace, and began to set the room in order,\nstooping gracefully, and letting Lavretsky feel in every movement that\nshe regarded him as an unpolished bear.\n\nHe looked with aversion at her faded, but still \"piquante,\" ironical,\nParisian face, at her white elbow-sleeves, her silk apron, and little\nlight cap. He sent her away at last, and after long hesitation\n(as Varvara Pavlovna still did not return) he decided to go to the\nKalitins'--not to see Marya Dmitrievna (he would not for anything in the\nworld have gone into that drawing-room, the room where his wife\nwas), but to go up to Marfa Timofyevna's. He remembered that the back\nstaircase from the servants' entrance led straight to her apartment.\nHe acted on this plan; fortune favoured him; he met Shurotchka in the\ncourt-yard; she conducted him up to Marfa Timofyevna's. He found her,\ncontrary to her usual habit, alone; she was sitting without a cap in\na corner, bent, and her arms crossed over her breast. The old lady was\nmuch upset on seeing Lavretsky, she got up quickly and began to move to\nand fro in the room as if she were looking for her cap.\n\n\"Ah, it's you,\" she began, fidgeting about and avoiding meeting his\neyes, \"well, how do you do? Well, well, what's to be done! Where were\nyou yesterday? Well, she has come, so there, there! Well, it must... one\nway or another.\"\n\nLavretsky dropped into a chair.\n\n\"Well, sit down, sit down,\" the old lady went on. \"Did you come straight\nup-stairs? Well, there, of course. So... you came to see me? Thanks.\"\n\nThe old lady was silent for a little; Lavretsky did not know what to say\nto her; but she understood him.\n\n\"Lisa... yes, Lisa was here just now,\" pursued Marfa Timofyevna, tying\nand untying the tassels of her reticule. \"She was not quite well.\nShurotchka, where are you? Come here, my girl; why can't you sit still\na little? My head aches too. It must be the effect of the singing and\nmusic.\"\n\n\"What singing, auntie?\"\n\n\"Why, we have been having those--upon my word, what do you call\nthem--duets here. And all in Italian: chi-chi--and cha-cha--like magpies\nfor all the world with their long drawn-out notes as if they'd pull\nyour very soul out. That's Panshin, and your wife too. And how quickly\neverything was settled; just as though it were all among relations,\nwithout ceremony. However, one may well say, even a dog will try to find\na home; and won't be lost so long as folks don't drive it out.\"\n\n\"Still, I confess I did not expect this,\" rejoined Lavretsky; \"there\nmust be great effrontery to do this.\"\n\n\"No, my darling, it's not effrontery, it's calculation, God forgive her!\nThey say you are sending her off to Lavriky; is it true?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am giving up that property to Varvara Pavlovna.\"\n\n\"Has she asked you for money?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Well, that won't be long in coming. But I have only now got a look at\nyou. Are you quite well?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Shurotchka!\" cried Marfa Timofyevna suddenly, \"run and tell Lisaveta\nMihalovna,--at least, no, ask her... is she down-stairs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then; ask her where she put my book? she will know.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nThe old lady grew fidgety again and began opening a drawer in the chest.\nLavretsky sat still without stirring in his place.\n\nAll at once light footsteps were heard on the stairs--and Lisa came in.\n\nLavretsky stood up and bowed; Lisa remained at the door.\n\n\"Lisa, Lisa, darling,\" began Marfa Timofyevna eagerly, \"where is my\nbook? where did you put my book?\"\n\n\"What book, auntie?\"\n\n\"Why, goodness me, that book! But I didn't call you though... There, it\ndoesn't matter. What are you doing down-stairs? Here Fedor Ivanitch has\ncome. How is your head?\"\n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"You keep saying it's nothing. What have you going on\ndown-stairs--music?\"\n\n\"No--they are playing cards.\"\n\n\"Well, she's ready for anything. Shurotchka, I see you want a run in the\ngarden--run along.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Marfa Timofyevna.\"\n\n\"Don't argue, if you please, run along. Nastasya Karpovna has gone out\ninto the garden all by herself; you keep her company. You must treat the\nold with respect.\"--Shurotchka departed--\"But where is my cap? Where has\nit got to?\"\n\n\"Let me look for it,\" said Lisa.\n\n\"Sit down, sit down; I have still the use of my legs. It must be inside\nin my bedroom.\"\n\nAnd flinging a sidelong glance in Lavretsky's direction, Marfa\nTimofyevna went out. She left the door open; but suddenly she came back\nto it and shut it.\n\nLisa leant back against her chair and quietly covered her face with her\nhands; Lavretsky remained where he was.\n\n\"This is how we were to meet again!\" he brought out at last.\n\nLisa took her hands from her face.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said faintly: \"we were quickly punished.\"\n\n\"Punished,\" said Lavretsky.... \"What had you done to be punished?\"\n\nLisa raised her eyes to him. There was neither sorrow or disquiet\nexpressed in them; they seemed smaller and dimmer. Her face was pale;\nand pale too her slightly parted lips.\n\nLavretsky's heart shuddered for pity and love.\n\n\"You wrote to me; all is over,\" he whispered, \"yes, all is over--before\nit had begun.\"\n\n\"We must forget all that,\" Lisa brought out; \"I am glad that you have\ncome; I wanted to write to you, but it is better so. Only we must take\nadvantage quickly of these minutes. It is left for both of us to do our\nduty. You, Fedor Ivanitch, must be reconciled with your wife.\"\n\n\"Lisa!\"\n\n\"I beg you to do so; by that alone can we expiate... all that has\nhappened. You will think about it--and will not refuse me.\"\n\n\"Lisa, for God's sake,--you are asking what is impossible. I am ready to\ndo everything you tell me; but to be reconciled to her now!... I consent\nto everything, I have forgotten everything; but I cannot force my\nheart.... Indeed, this is cruel!\n\n\"I do not even ask of you... what you say; do not live with her, if you\ncannot; but be reconciled,\" replied Lisa and again she hid her eyes in\nher hand.--\"remember your little girl; do it for my sake.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Lavretsky muttered between his teeth: \"I will do that, I\nsuppose in that I shall fulfill my duty. But you-what does your duty\nconsist in?\"\n\n\"That I know myself.\"\n\nLavretsky started suddenly.\n\n\"You cannot be making up your mind to marry Panshin?\" he said.\n\nLisa gave an almost imperceptible smile.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, Lisa, Lisa!\" cried Lavretsky, \"how happy you might have been!\"\n\nLisa looked at him again.\n\n\"Now you see yourself, Fedor Ivanitch, that happiness does not depend on\nus, but on God.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you--\"\n\nThe door from the adjoining room opened quickly and Marfa Timofyevna\ncame in with her cap in her hand.\n\n\"I have found it at last,\" she said, standing between Lavretsky and Lisa;\n\"I had laid it down myself. That's what age does for one, alack--though\nyouth's not much better.\"\n\n\"Well, and are you going to Lavriky yourself with your wife?\" she added,\nturning to Lavretsky.\n\n\"To Lavriky with her? I don't know,\" he said, after a moment's\nhesitation.\n\n\"You are not going down-stairs.\"\n\n\"To-day,--no, I'm not.\"\n\n\"Well, well, you know best; but you, Lisa, I think, ought to go down.\nAh, merciful powers, I have forgotten to feed my bullfinch. There, stop\na minute, I'll soon--\" And Marfa Timofyevna ran off without putting on\nher cap.\n\nLavretsky walked quickly up to Lisa.\n\n\"Lisa,\" he began in a voice of entreaty, \"we are parting for ever, my\nheart is torn,--give me your hand at parting.\"\n\nLisa raised her head, her wearied eyes, their light almost extinct,\nrested upon him.... \"No,\" she uttered, and she drew back the hand she\nwas holding out. \"No, Lavretsky (it was the first time she had used this\nname), I will not give you my hand. What is the good? Go away, I beseech\nyou. You know I love you... yes, I love you,\" she added with an effort;\n\"but no... no.\"\n\nShe pressed her handkerchief to her lips.\n\n\"Give me, at least, that handkerchief.\"\n\nThe door creaked... the handkerchief slid on to Lisa's lap. Lavretsky\nsnatched it before it had time to fall to the floor, thrust it quickly\ninto a side pocket, and turning round met Marfa Timofyevna's eyes.\n\n\"Lisa, darling, I fancy your mother is calling you,\" the old lady\ndeclared.\n\nLisa at once got up and went away.\n\nMarfa Timofyevna sat down again in her corner. Lavretsky began to take\nleave of her.\n\n\"Fedor,\" she said suddenly.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Are you an honest man?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I ask you, are you an honest man?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"H'm. But give me your word of honour that you will be an honest man.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But why?\"\n\n\"I know why. And you too, my dear friend, if you think well, you're no\nfool--will understand why I ask it of you. And now, good-bye, my dear.\nThanks for your visit; and remember you have given your word, Fedya,\nand kiss me. Oh, my dear, it's hard for you, I know; but there, it's not\neasy for any one. Once I used to envy the flies; I thought it's for\nthem it's good to be alive but one night I heard a fly complaining in\na spider's web--no, I think, they too have their troubles. There's no\nhelp, Fedya; but remember your promise all the same. Good-bye.\"\n\nLavretsky went down the back staircase, and had reached the gates when a\nman-servant overtook him.\n\n\"Marya Dmitrievna told me to ask you to go in to her,\" he commenced to\nLavretsky.\n\n\"Tell her, my boy, that just now I can't--\" Fedor Ivanitch was\nbeginning.\n\n\"Her excellency told me to ask you very particularly,\" continued the\nservant. \"She gave orders to say she was at home.\"\n\n\"Have the visitors gone?\" asked Lavretsky.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied the servant with a grin.\n\nLavretsky shrugged his shoulders and followed him.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIII\n\n\nMarya Dmitrievna was sitting alone in her boudoir in an easy-chair,\nsniffing eau de cologne; a glass of orange-flower-water was standing on\na little table near her. She was agitated and seemed nervous.\n\nLavretsky came in.\n\n\"You wanted to see me,\" he said, bowing coldly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Marya Dmitrievna, and she sipped a little water: \"I heard\nthat you had gone straight up to my aunt; I gave orders that you should\nbe asked to come in; I wanted to have a little talk with you. Sit down,\nplease,\" Marya Dmitrievna took breath. \"You know,\" she went on, \"your\nwife has come.\"\n\n\"I was aware of that,\" remarked Lavretsky.\n\n\"Well, then, that is, I wanted to say, she came to me, and I received\nher; that is what I wanted to explain to you, Fedor Ivanitch. Thank God\nI have, I may say, gained universal respect, and for no consideration in\nthe world would I do anything improper. Though I foresaw that it would\nbe disagreeable to you, still I could not make up my mind to deny myself\nto her, Fedor Ivanitch; she is a relation of mine--through you; put\nyourself in my position, what right had I to shut my doors on her--you\nwill agree with me?\"\n\n\"You are exciting yourself needlessly, Mary Dmitrievna,\" replied\nLavretsky; \"you acted very well, I am not angry. I have not the least\nintention of depriving Varvara Pavlovna of the opportunity of seeing her\nfriends; I did not come in to you to-day simply because I did not care\nto meet her--that was all.\"\n\n\"Ah, how glad I am to hear you say that, Fedor Ivanitch,\" cried Marya\nDmitrievna, \"but I always expected it of your noble sentiments. And as\nfor my being excited--that's not to be wondered at; I am a woman and\na mother. And your wife... of course I cannot judge between you and\nher--as I said to her herself; but she is such a delightful woman that\nshe can produce nothing but a pleasant impression.\"\n\nLavretsky gave a laugh and played with his hat.\n\n\"And this is what I wanted to say to you besides, Fedor Ivanitch,\"\ncontinued Marya Dmitrievna, moving slightly nearer up to him, \"if you\nhad seen the modesty of her behaviour, how respectful she is! Really,\nit is quite touching. And if you had heard how she spoke of you! I have\nbeen to blame towards him, she said, altogether; I did not know how\nto appreciate him, she said; he is an angel, she said, and not a man.\nReally, that is what she said--an angel. Her penitence is such... Ah,\nupon my word, I have never seen such penitence!\"\n\n\"Well, Marya Dmitrievna,\" observed Lavretsky, \"if I may be inquisitive:\nI am told that Varvara Pavlovna has been singing in your drawing-room;\ndid she sing during the time of her penitence, or how was it?\"\n\n\"Ah, I wonder you are not ashamed to talk like that! She sang and played\nthe piano only to do me a kindness, because I positively entreated,\nalmost commanded her to do so. I saw that she was sad, so sad; I thought\nhow to distract her mind--and I heard that she had such marvellous\ntalent! I assure you, Fedor Ivanitch, she is utterly crushed, ask Sergei\nPetrovitch even; a heart-broken woman, tout a fait: what do you say?\"\n\nLavretsky only shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"And then what a little angel is that Adotchka of yours, what a darling!\nHow sweet she is, what a clever little thing; how she speaks French; and\nunderstand Russian too--she called me 'auntie' in Russian. And you know\nthat as for shyness--almost all children at her age are shy--there's\nnot a trace of it. She's so like you, Fedor Ivanitch, it's amazing. The\neyes, the forehead--well, it's you over again, precisely you. I am not\nparticularly fond of little children, I must own; but I simply lost my\nheart to your little girl.\"\n\n\"Marya Dmitrievna,\" Lavretsky blurted out suddenly, \"allow me to ask you\nwhat is your object in talking to me like this?\"\n\n\"What object?\" Marya Dmitrievna sniffed her eau de cologne again,\nand took a sip of water. \"Why, I am speaking to you, Fedor Ivanitch,\nbecause--I am a relation of yours, you know, I take the warmest interest\nin you--I know your heart is of the best. Listen to me, mon cousin. I\nam at any rate a woman of experience, and I shall not talk at random:\nforgive her, forgive your wife.\" Marya Dmitrievna's eyes suddenly filled\nwith tears. \"Only think: her youth, her inexperience... and who knows,\nperhaps, bad example; she had not a mother who could bring her up in the\nright way. Forgive her, Fedor Ivanitch, she has been punished enough.\"\n\nThe tears were trickling down Marya Dmitrievna's cheeks: she did not\nwipe them away, she was fond of weeping. Lavretsky sat as if on thorns.\n\"Good God,\" he thought, \"what torture, what a day I have had to-day!\"\n\n\"You make no reply,\" Marya Dmitrievna began again. \"How am I to\nunderstand you? Can you really be so cruel? No, I will not believe it.\nI feel that my words have influenced you, Fedor Ivanitch. God reward you\nfor your goodness, and now receive your wife from my hands.\"\n\nInvoluntarily Lavretsky jumped up from his chair; Marya Dmitrievna\nalso rose and running quickly behind a screen, she led forth Varvara\nPavlovna. Pale, almost lifeless, with downcast eyes, she seemed to have\nrenounced all thought, all will of her own, and to have surrendered\nherself completely to Marya Dmitrievna.\n\nLavretsky stepped back a pace.\n\n\"You have been here all the time!\" he cried.\n\n\"Do not blame her,\" explained Marya Dmitrievna; \"she was most unwilling\nto stay, but I forced her to remain. I put her behind the screen. She\nassured me that this would only anger you more; I would not even listen\nto her; I know you better than she does. Take your wife back from my\nhands; come, Varya, do not fear, fall at your husband's feet (she gave a\npull at her arm) and my blessing\"...\n\n\"Stop a minute, Marya Dmitrievna,\" said Lavretsky in a low but\nstartlingly impressive voice. \"I dare say you are fond of affecting\nscenes\" (Lavretsky was right, Marya Dmitrievna still retained her\nschool-girl's passion for a little melodramatic effect), \"they amuse\nyou; but they may be anything but pleasant for other people. But I\nam not going to talk to you; in this scene you are not the principal\ncharacter. What do you want to get out of me, madam?\" he added, turning\nto his wife. \"Haven't I done all I could for you? Don't tell me you did\nnot contrive this interview; I shall not believe you--and you know that\nI cannot possibly believe you. What is it you want? You are clever--you\ndo nothing without an object. You must realise, that as for living with,\nas I once lived with you, that I cannot do; not because I am angry with\nyou, but because I have become a different man. I told you so the day\nafter your return, and you yourself, at that moment, agreed with me in\nyour! heart. But you want to reinstate yourself in public opinion; it is\nnot enough for you to live in my house, you want to live with me under\nthe same roof--isn't that it?\"\n\n\"I want your forgiveness,\" pronounced Varvara Pavlovna, not raising her\neyes.\n\n\"She wants your forgiveness,\" repeated Marya Dmitrievna.\n\n\"And not for my own sake, but for Ada's,\" murmured Varvara Pavlovna.\n\n\"And not for her own sake, but for your Ada's,\" repeated Marya\nDmitrievna.\n\n\"Very good. Is that what you want?\" Lavretsky uttered with an effort.\n\"Certainly, I consent to that too.\"\n\nVarvara Pavlovna darted a swift glance at him, but Marya Dmitrievna\ncried: \"There, God be thanked!\" and again drew Varvara Pavlvona forward\nby the arm. \"Take her now from my arms--\"\n\n\"Stop a minute, I tell you,\" Lavretsky interrupted her, \"I agree to\nlive with you, Varvara Pavlovna,\" he continued, \"that is to say, I will\nconduct you to Lavriky, and I will live there with you, as long as I can\nendure it, and then I will go away--and will come back again. You see,\nI do not want to deceive you; but do not demand anything more. You\nwould laugh yourself if I were to carry out the desire of our respected\ncousin, were to press you to my breast, and to fall to assuring you that\n... that the past had not been; and the felled tree can bud again. But I\nsee, I must submit. You will not understand these words... but that's\nno matter. I repeat, I will live with you... or no, I cannot promise\nthat... I will be reconciled with you, I will regard you as my wife\nagain.\"\n\n\"Give her, at least your hand on it,\" observed Marya Dmitrievna, whose\ntears had long since dried up.\n\n\"I have never deceived Varvara Pavlovna hitherto,\" returned Lavretsky;\n\"she will believe me without that. I will take her to Lavriky; and\nremember, Varvara Pavlovna, our treaty is to be reckoned as broken\ndirectly you go away from Lavriky. And now allow me to take leave.\"\n\nHe bowed to both the ladies, and hurriedly went away.\n\n\"Are you not going to take her with you!\" Marya Dmitrievna cried after\nhim.... \"Leave him alone,\" Varvara Pavlovna whispered to her. And at\nonce she embraced her, and began thanking her, kissing her hands and\ncalling her saviour.\n\nMarya Dmitrievna received her caresses indulgently; but at heart she was\ndiscontented with Lavretsky, with Varvara Pavlovna, and with the whole\nscene she had prepared. Very little sentimentality had come of it;\nVarvara Pavlovna, in her opinion, ought to have flung herself at her\nhusband's feet.\n\n\"How was it you didn't understand me?\" she commented: \"I kept saying\n'down.'\"\n\n\"It is better as it was, dear auntie; do not be uneasy--it was all for\nthe best,\" Varvara Pavlovna assured her.\n\n\"Well, any way, he's as cold as ice,\" observed Marya Dmitrievna. \"You\ndidn't weep, it is true, but I was in floods of tears before his eyes.\nHe wants to shut you up at Lavriky. Why, won't you even be able to come\nand see me? All men are unfeeling,\" she concluded, with a significant\nshake of the head.\n\n\"But then women can appreciate goodness and noble-heartedness,\"\nsaid Varvara Pavlovna, and gently dropping on her knees before Marya\nDmitrievna, she flung her arms about her round person, and pressed her\nface against it. That face wore a sly smile, but Marya Dmitrievna's\ntears began to flow again.\n\nWhen Lavretsky returned home, he locked himself in his valet's room, and\nflung himself on a sofa; he lay like that till morning.\n\n\n\nChapter XLIV\n\n\nThe following day was Sunday. The sound of bells ringing for early mass\ndid not wake Lavretsky--he had not closed his eyes all night--but it\nreminded him of another Sunday, when at Lisa's desire he had gone to\nchurch. He got up hastily; some secret voice told him that he would\nsee her there to-day. He went noiselessly out of the house, leaving a\nmessage for Varvara Pavlovna that he would be back to dinner, and with\nlong strides he made his way in the direction in which the monotonously\nmournful bells were calling him. He arrived early; there was scarcely\nany one in the church; a deacon was reading the service in the chair;\nthe measured drone of his voice--sometimes broken by a cough--fell\nand rose at even intervals. Lavretsky placed himself not far from the\nentrance. Worshippers came in one by one, stopped, crossed themselves,\nand bowed in all directions; their steps rang out in the empty, silent\nchurch, echoing back distinctly under the arched roof. An infirm poor\nlittle old woman in a worn-out cloak with a hood was on her knees near\nLavretsky, praying assiduously; her toothless, yellow, wrinkled face\nexpressed intense emotion; her red eyes were gazing fixedly upwards at\nthe holy figures on the iconostasis; her bony hand was constantly coming\nout from under her cloak, and slowly and earnestly making a great sign\nof the cross. A peasant with a bushy beard and a surly face, dishevelled\nand unkempt, came into the church, and at once fell on both knees, and\nbegan directly crossing himself in haste, bending back his head with\na shake after each prostration. Such bitter grief was expressed in his\nface, and in all his actions, that Lavretsky made up his mind to go\nup to him and ask him what was wrong. The peasant timidly and morosely\nstarted back, looked at him.... \"My son is dead,\" he articulated\nquickly, and again fell to bowing to the earth. \"What could replace the\nconsolations of the Church to them?\" thought Lavretsky; and he tried!\nhimself to pray, but his heart was hard and heavy, and his thoughts\nwere far away. He kept expecting Lisa, but Lisa did not come. The church\nbegan to be full of people; but still she was not there. The service\ncommenced, the deacon had already read the gospel, they began ringing\nfor the last prayer; Lavretsky moved a little forward--and suddenly\ncaught sight of Lisa. She had com before him, but he had not seen her;\nshe was hidden in a recess between the wall and the choir, and neither\nmoved nor looked round. Lavretsky did not take his eyes off he till the\nvery end of the service; he was saying farewell to her. The people\nbegan to disperse, but she still remained; it seemed as though she were\nwaiting for Lavretsky to go out. At last she crossed herself for the\nlast time and went out--there was only a maid with her--not turning\nround. Lavretsky went out of the church after her and overtook her in\nthe street; she was walking very quickly, with downcast head, and a veil\nover her face.\n\n\"Good-morning, Lisaveta Mihalovna,\" he said aloud with assumed\ncarelessness: \"may I accompany you?\"\n\nShe made no reply; he walked beside her.\n\n\"Are you content with me?\" he asked her, dropping his voice. \"Have you\nheard what happened yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she replied in a whisper, \"that was well.\" And she went\nstill more quickly.\n\n\"Are you content?\"\n\nLisa only bent her head in assent.\n\n\"Fedor Ivanitch,\" she began in a calm but faint voice, \"I wanted to beg\nyou not to come to see us any more; go away as soon as possible, we may\nsee each other again later--sometime--in a year. But now, do this for my\nsake; fulfil my request, for God's sake.\"\n\n\"I am ready to obey you in everything, Lisaveta Mihalovna; but are we\nreally to part like this? will you not say one word to me?\"\n\n\"Fedor Ivanitch, you are walking near me now.... But already you are so\nfar from me. And not only you, but--\"\n\n\"Speak out, I entreat you!\" cried Lavretsky, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"You will hear perhaps... but whatever it may be, forget... no, do not\nforget; remember me.\"\n\n\"Me forget you--\"\n\n\"That's enough, good-bye. Do not come after me.\"\n\n\"Lisa!\" Lavretsky was beginning.\n\n\"Good-bye, good-bye!\" she repeated, pulling her veil still lower and\nalmost running forward. Lavretsky looked after her, and with bowed head,\nturned back along the street. He stumbled up against Lemm, who was also\nwalking along with his eyes on the ground, and his hat pulled down to\nhis nose.\n\nThey looked at one another without speaking.\n\n\"Well, what have you to say?\" Lavretsky brought out at last.\n\n\"What have I to say?\" returned Lemm, grimly. \"I have nothing to say. All\nis dead, and we are dead (Alles ist todt, und wir sind todt). So you're\ngoing to the right, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And I go to the left. Good-bye.\"\n\nThe following morning Fedor Ivanitch set off with his wife for Lavriky.\nShe drove in front in the carriage with Ada and Justine; he behind, in\nthe coach. The pretty little girl did not move away from the window\nthe whole journey; she was astonished at everything; the peasants, the\nwomen, the wells, the yokes over the horses' heads, the bells and the\nflocks of crows. Justine shared her wonder. Varvara Pavlovna laughed\nat their remarks and exclamations. She was in excellent spirits; before\nleaving town, she had come to an explanation with her husband.\n\n\"I understand your position,\" she said to him, and from the look in\nher subtle eyes, he was able to infer that she understood his position\nfully, \"but you must do me, at least, this justice, that I am easy to\nlive with; I will not fetter you or hinder you; I wanted to secure Ada's\nfuture, I want nothing more.\"\n\n\"Well, you have obtained your object,\" observed Fedor Ivanitch.\n\n\"I only dream of one thing now: to hide myself for ever in obscurity. I\nshall remember your goodness always.\"\n\n\"Enough of that,\" he interrupted.\n\n\"And I shall know how to respect your independence and tranquillity,\"\nshe went on, completing the phrases she had prepared.\n\nLavretsky made her a low bow.\n\nVarvara Pavlovna then believed her husband was thanking her in his\nheart.\n\nOn the evening of the next day they reached Lavriky; a week later,\nLavretsky set off for Moscow, leaving his wife five thousand roubles for\nher household expenses; and the day after Lavretsky's departure, Panshin\nmade his appearance. Varvara Pavlovna had begged him not to forget her\nin her solitude. She gave him the best possible reception, and, till a\nlate hour of the night, the lofty apartments of the house and even the\ngarden re-echoed with the sound of music, singing, and lively French\ntalk. For three days Varvara Pavlovna entertained Panshin; when he took\nleave of her, warmly pressing her lovely hands, he promised to come back\nvery soon--and he kept his word.\n\n\n\nChapter XLV\n\n\nLisa had a room to herself on the second story of her mother's house, a\nclean bright little room with a little white bed, with pots of flowers\nin the corners and before the windows, a small writing-table, a\nbook-stand, and a crucifix on the wall. It was always called the\nnursery; Lisa had been born in it. When she returned from the church\nwhere she had seen Lavretsky she set everything in her room in order\nmore carefully than usual, dusted it everywhere, looked through and tied\nup with ribbon all her copybooks, and the letters of her girl-friends,\nshut up all the drawers, watered the flowers and caressed every blossom\nwith her hand. All this she did without haste, noiselessly, with a kind\nof rapt and gentle solicitude on her face. She topped at last in the\nmiddle of the room, slowly looked around, and going up to the table\nabove which the crucifix was hanging, she fell on her knees, dropped her\nhead on to her clasped hands and remained motionless.\n\nMarfa Timofyevna came in and found her in this position. Lisa did not\nobserve her entrance. The old lady stepped out on tip-toe and coughed\nloudly several times outside the door. Lisa rose quickly and wiped her\neyes, which were bright with unshed tears.\n\n\"Ah! I see, you have been setting your cell to rights again,\" observed\nMarfa Timofyevna, and she bent low over a young rose-tree in a pot; \"how\nnice it smells!\"\n\nLisa looked thoughtfully at her aunt.\n\n\"How strange you should use that word!\" she murmured.\n\n\"What word, eh?\" the old lady returned quickly. \"What do you mean? This\nis horrible,\" she began, suddenly flinging off her cap and sitting down\non Lisa's little bed; \"it is more than I can bear! this is the fourth\nday now that I have been boiling over inside; I can't pretend not to\nnotice any longer; I can't see you getting pale, and fading away, and\nweeping, I can't I can't!\"\n\n\"Why, what is the matter, auntie?\" said Lisa, \"it's nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing!\" cried Marfa Timofyevna; \"you may tell that to others but\nnot to me. Nothing, who was on her knees just to this minute? and\nwhose eyelashes are still wet with tears? Nothing, indeed! why, look\nat yourself, what have you done with your face, what has become of your\neyes?--Nothing! do you suppose I don't know all?\"\n\n\"It will pass off, auntie; give me time.\"\n\n\"It will pass of, but when? Good God! Merciful Saviour! can you have\nloved him like this? why, he's an old man, Lisa, darling. There, I don't\ndispute he's a good fellow, no harm in him; but what of that? we are all\ngood people, the world is not so small, there will be always plenty of\nthat commodity.\"\n\n\"I tell you, it will all pass away, it has all passed away already.\"\n\n\"Listen, Lisa, darling, what I am going to say to you,\" Marfa Timofyevna\nsaid suddenly, making Lisa sit beside her, and straightening her hair\nand her neckerchief. \"It seems to you now in the mist of the worst of it\nthat nothing can ever heal your sorrow. Ah, my darling, the only thing\nthat can't be cured is death. You only say to yourself now: 'I won't\ngive in to it--so there!' and you will be surprised yourself how soon,\nhow easily it will pass of. Only have patience.\"\n\n\"Auntie,\" returned Lisa, \"it has passed off already, it is all over.\"\n\n\"Passed! how has it passed? Why, your poor little nose has grown sharp\nalready and you say it is over. A fine way of getting over it!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is over, auntie, if you will only try to help me,\" Lisa\ndeclared with sudden animation, and she flung herself on Marfa\nTimofyevna's neck. \"Dar auntie, be a friend to me, help me, don't be\nangry, understand me\"...\n\n\"Why, what is it, what is it, my good girl? Don't terrify me, please; I\nshall scream directly; don't look at me like that; tell me quickly, what\nis it?\"\n\n\"I--I want,\" Lisa hid her face on Marfa Timofyevna's bosom, \"I want to\ngo into a convent,\" she articulated faintly.\n\nThe old lady almost bounded off the bed.\n\n\"Cross yourself, my girl, Lisa, dear, think what you are saying; what\nare you thinking of? God have mercy on you!\" she stammered at last. \"Lie\ndown, my darling, sleep a little, all this comes from sleeplessness, my\ndearie.\"\n\nLisa raised her head, her cheeks were glowing.\n\n\"No, auntie,\" she said, \"don't speak like that; I have made up my mind,\nI prayed, I asked counsel of God; all is at an end, my life with you is\nat an end. Such a lesson was not for nothing; and it is not the first\ntime that I have thought of it. Happiness was not for me; even when I\nhad hopes of happiness, my heart was always heavy. I knew all my own\nsins and those of others, and how papa made our fortune; I know it all.\nFor all that there must be expiation. I am sorry for you, sorry for\nmamma, for Lenotchka; but there is no help; I feel that there is no\nliving here for me; I have taken leave of all, I have greeted everything\nin the house for the last time; something calls to me; I am sick at\nheart, I want to hide myself away for ever. Do not hinder me, do not\ndissuade me, help me, or else I must go away alone.\"\n\nMarfa Timofyevna listened to her niece with horror.\n\n\"She is ill, she is raving,\" she thought: \"we must send for a doctor;\nbut for which one? Gedeonovsky was praising one the other day; he always\ntells lies--but perhaps this time he spoke the truth.\" But when she was\nconvinced that Lisa was not ill, and was not raving, when she constantly\nmade the same answer to all her expostulations, Marfa Timofyevna was\nalarmed and distressed in earnest. \"But you don't know, my darling,\"\nshe began to reason with her, \"what a life it is in those convents! Why,\nthey would feed you, my own, on green hemp oil, and they would put you\nin the coarsest linen, and make you go about in the cold; you will never\nbe able to bear all that, Lisa, darling. All this is Agafya's doing; she\nled you astray. But then you know she began by living and lived for her\nown pleasure; you must live, too. At least, let me die in peace, and\nthen do as you like. And who has ever heard of such a thing, for the\nsake of such a--for the sake of a goat's beard, God forgive us!--for the\nsake of a man--to go into a convent! Why, if you are so sick at heart,\ngo on a pilgrimage, offer prayers to some saint, have a Te Deum sung,\nbut don't put the black hood on your head, my dear creature, my good\ngirl.\"\n\nAnd Marfa Timofyevna wept bitterly.\n\nLisa comforted her, wiped away her tears and wept herself, but remained\nunshaken. In her despair Marfa Timofyevna had recourse to threats: to\ntell her mother all about it... but that too was of no avail. Only at\nthe old lady's most earnest entreaties Lisa agreed to put off carrying\nout her plan for six months. Marfa Timofyevna was obliged to promise\nin return that if, within six months, she did not change her mind,\nshe would herself help her and would do all she could to gain Marya\nDmitrievna's consent.\n\nIn spite of her promise to bury herself in seclusion, at the first\napproach of cold weather, Varvara Pavlovna, having provided herself with\nfunds, removed to Petersburg, where she took a modest but charming set\nof apartments, found for her by Panshin; who had left the O-----district\na little before. During the latter part of his residence in O----- he\nhad completely lost Marya Dmitrievna's good graces; he had suddenly\ngiven up visiting her and scarcely stirred from Lavriky. Varvara\nPavolvna had enslaved him, literally enslaved him, no other word can\ndescribe her boundless, irresistible, unquestioned sway over him.\n\nLavretsky spent the winter in Moscow; and in the spring of the\nfollowing year the news reached him that Lisa had taken the veil in the\nB-----convent, in one of the remote parts of Russia.\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\n\nEight years had passed by. Once more the spring had come.... But we will\nsay a few words first of the fate of Mihalevitch, Panshin, and Madame\nLaverestky--and then take leave of them. Mihalevitch, after long\nwanderings, has at last fallen in with exactly the right work for him;\nhe has received the position of senior superintendent of a government\nschool. He is very well content with his lot; his pupils adore him,\nthough they mimick him too. Panshin has gained great advancement in\nrank, and already has a directorship in view; he walks with a slight\nstoop, caused doubtless by the weight round his neck of the Vladimir\ncross which has been conferred on him. The official in him has finally\ngained the ascendency over the artist; his still youngish face has grown\nyellow, and his hair scanty; he now neither sings nor sketches, but\napplies himself in secret to literature; he has written a comedy, in\nthe style of a \"proverb,\" and as nowadays all writers have to draw a\nportrait of some one or something, he has drawn in it the portrait of\na coquette, and he reads it privately to two or three ladies who look\nkindly upon him. He has, however, not entered upon matrimony, though\nmany excellent opportunities of doing so have presented themselves. For\nthis Varvara Pavlovna was responsible. As for her, she lives constantly\nat Paris, as in former days. Fedor Ivanitch has given her a promissory\nnote for a large sum, and has so secured immunity from the possibility\nof her making a second sudden descent upon him. She has grown older and\nstouter, but is still charming and elegant. Every one has his ideal.\nVarvara Pavlovna found hers in the dramatic works of M. Dumas Fils.\nShe diligently frequents the theatres, when consumptive and sentimental\n\"dames aux camelias\" are brought on the stage; to be Madame Doche seems\nto her the height of human bliss; she once declared that she did not\ndesire a better fate for her own daughter. It is to be hoped that fate\nwill spare Mademoiselle Ada from such happiness; from a rosy-cheeked,\nchubby child she has turned into a weak-chested, pale girl; her nerves\nare already deranged. The number of Varvara Pavlovna adorers has\ndiminished, but she still has some; a few she will probably retain to\nthe end of her days. The most ardent of them in these later days is a\ncertain Zakurdalo-Skubrinikov, a retired guardsman, a full-bearded man\nof thirty-eight, of exceptionally vigorous physique. The French habitues\nof Madame Lavretsky's salon call him \"le gros taureau de l'Ukraine;\"\nVarvara Pavlovna never invites him to her fashionable evening reunions,\nbut he is in the fullest enjoyment of her favours.\n\nAnd so--eight years have passed by. Once more the breezes of spring\nbreathed brightness and rejoicing from the heavens; once more spring\nwas smiling upon the earth and upon men; once more under her caresses\neverything was turning to blossom, to love, to song. The town of\nO-----had undergone little change in the course of these eight\nyears; but Marya Dmitrievna's house seemed to have grown younger; its\nfreshly-painted walls gave a bright welcome, and the panes of its open\nwindows were crimson, shining in the setting sun; from these windows the\nlight merry sound of ringing young voices and continual laughter floated\ninto the street; the whole house seemed astir with life and brimming\nover with gaiety. The lady of the house herself had long been in her\ntomb; Marya Dmitrievna had died two years after Lisa took the veil, and\nMafa Timofyevna had not long survived her niece; they lay side by side\nin the cemetery of the town. Nastasya Karpovna too was no more; for\nseveral years! the faithful old woman had gone every week to say a\nprayer over her friend's ashes..... Her time had come, and now her bones\ntoo lay in the damp earth. But Marya Dmitreivna's house had not passed\ninto stranger's hands, it had not gone out of her family, the home had\nnot been broken upon. Lenotchka, transformed into a slim, beautiful\nyoung girl, and her betrothed lover--a fair-haired officer of hussars;\nMarya Dmitrievna's son, who had just been married in Petersburg and had\ncome with his young wife for the spring to O-----; his wife's sister, a\nschool-girl of sixteen, with glowing cheeks and bright eyes; Shurotchka,\ngrown up and also pretty, made up the youthful household, whose laughter\nand talk set the walls of the Kalitins' house resounding. Everything\nin the house was changed, everything was in keeping with its new\ninhabitants. Beardless servant lads, grinning and full of fun, had\nreplaced the sober old servants of former days. Two setter dogs dashed\nwildly about and gambolled over the sofas, where the fat Roska had at\none time waddled in solemn dignity. The stables were filled with slender\nracers, spirited carriage horses, fiery out-riders with plaited manes,\nand riding horses from the Don. The breakfast, dinner, and supper-hours\nwere all in confusion and disorder; in the words of the neighbours,\n\"unheard-of arrangements\" were made.\n\nOn the evening of which we are speaking, the inhabitants of the\nKalitins' house (the eldest of them, Lenotchka's betrothed, was only\ntwenty-four) were engaged in a game, which, though not of a very\ncomplicated nature, was, to judge from their merry laughter, exceedingly\nentertaining to them; they were running about the rooms, chasing one\nanother; the dogs, too, were running and barking, and the canaries,\nhanging in cages above the windows, were straining their throats in\nrivalry and adding to the general uproar by the shrill trilling of their\npiercing notes. At the very height of this deafening merry-making a\nmud-bespattered carriage stopped at the gate, and a man of five-and\nforty, in a travelling dress, stepped out of it and stood still in\namazement. He stood a little time without stirring, watching the house\nwith attentive eyes; then went through the little gate in the courtyard,\nand slowly mounted the steps. In the hall he met no one; but the door\nof a room was suddenly! flung open, and out of it rushed Shurotchka,\nflushed and hot, and instantly, with a ringing shout, all the young\nparty in pursuit of her. They stopped short at once and were quiet at\nthe sight of a stranger; but their clear eyes fixed on him wore the same\nfriendly expression, and their fresh faces were still smiling as Marya\nDmitreivna's son went up to the visitor and asked him cordially what he\ncould do for him.\n\n\"I am Lavretsky,\" replied the visitor.\n\nHe was answered by a shout in chorus--and not because these young people\nwere greatly delighted at the arrival of a distant, almost forgotten\nrelation, but simply because they were ready to be delighted and\nmake noise at every opportunity. They surrounded Lavretsky at once;\nLenotchka, as an old acquaintance, was the first to mention her own\nname, and assured him that in a little while she would have certainly\nrecognised him. She presented him to the rest of the party, calling\neach, even her betrothed, by their pet names. They all trooped through\nthe dining-room into the drawing-room. The walls of both rooms had been\nrepapered; but the furniture remained the same. Lavretsky recognised the\npiano; even the embroidery-frame in the window was just the same, and in\nthe same position, and it seemed with the same unfinished embroidery\non it, as eight years ago. They made him sit down in a comfortable\narm-chair; all sat down politely in a circle round him. Questions,\nexclamations, and anecdotes followed.\n\n\"It's a long time since we have seen you,\" observed Lenotchka simply,\n\"and Varvara Pavlovna we have seen nothing of either.\"\n\n\"Well, no wonder!\" her brother hastened to interpose. \"I carried you off\nto Petersburg, and Fedor Ivanitch has been living all the time in the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Yes, and mamma died soon after then.\"\n\n\"And Marfa Timofyevna,\" observed Shurotchka.\n\n\"And Nastasya Karpovna,\" added Lenotchka, \"and Monsier Lemm.\"\n\n\"What? is Lemm dead?\" inquired Lavretsky.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied young Kalitin, \"he left here for Odessa; they say some\none enticed him there; and there he died.\"\n\n\"You don't happen to know,... did he leave any music?\"\n\n\"I don't know; not very likely.\"\n\nAll were silent and looked about them. A slight cloud of melancholy\nflitted over all the young faces.\n\n\"But Matross is alive,\" said Lenotchka suddenly.\n\n\"And Gedeonovsky,\" added her brother.\n\nAt Gedeonovsky's name a merry laugh broke out at once.\n\n\"Yes, he is alive, and as great a liar as ever,\" Marya Dmitrievna's\nson continued; \"and only fancy, yesterday this madcap\"--pointing to the\nschool-girl, his wife's sister--\"put some pepper in his snuff-box.\"\n\n\"How he did sneeze!\" cried Lenotchka, and again there was a burst of\nunrestrained laughter.\n\n\"We have had news of Lisa lately,\" observed young Kalitin, and again a\nhush fell upon all; \"there was good news of her; she is recovering her\nhealth a little now.\"\n\n\"She is still in the same convent?\" Lavretsky asked, not without some\neffort.\n\n\"Yes, still in the same.\"\n\n\"Does she write to you?\"\n\n\"No, never; but we get news through other people.\"\n\nA sudden and profound silence followed. \"A good angel is passing over,\"\nall were thinking.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to go into the garden?\" said Kalitin, turning to\nLavretsky; \"it is very nice now, though we have let it run wild a\nlittle.\"\n\nLavretsky went out into the garden, and the first thing that met his\neyes was the very garden seat on which he had once spent with Lisa those\nfew blissful moments, never repeated; it had grown black and warped; but\nhe recognised it, and his soul was filled with that emotion, unequalled\nfor sweetness and for bitterness--the emotion of keen sorrow for\nvanished youth, for the happiness which has once been possessed.\n\nHe walked along the avenues with the young people; the lime-trees looked\nhardly older or taller in the eight years, but their shade was thicker;\non the other hand, all the bushes had sprung up, the raspberry bushes\nhad grown strong, the hazels were tangled thicket, and from all sides\nrose the fresh scent of the trees and grass and lilac.\n\n\"This would be a nice place for Puss-in-the-Corner,\" cried Lenotchka\nsuddenly, as they came upon a small green lawn, surrounded by\nlime-trees, \"and we are just five, too.\"\n\n\"Have you forgotten Fedor Ivanitch?\" replied her brother,... \"or didn't\nyou count yourself?\"\n\nLenotchka blushed slightly.\n\n\"But would Fedor Ivanitch, at his age-----\" she began.\n\n\"Please, play your games,\" Lavretsky hastened to interpose; \"don't pay\nattention to me. I shall be happier myself, when I am sure I am not in\nyour way. And there's no need for you to entertain me; we old fellows\nhave an occupation which you know nothing of yet, and which no amusement\ncan replace--our memories.\"\n\nThe young people listened to Lavretsky with polite but rather ironical\nrespect--as though a teacher were giving them a lesson--and suddenly\nthey all dispersed, and ran to the lawn; four stood near trees, one in\nthe middle, and the game began.\n\nAnd Lavretsky went back into the house, went into the dining-room, drew\nnear the piano and touched one of the keys; it gave out a faint but\nclear sound; on that note had begun the inspired melody with which long\nago on that same happy night Lemm, the dead Lemm, had thrown him into\nsuch transports. Then Lavretsky went into the drawing-room, and for a\nlong time he did not leave it; in that room where he had so often seen\nLisa, her image rose most vividly before him; he seemed to feel the\ntraces of her presence round him; but his grief for her was crushing,\nnot easy to bear; it had none of the peace which comes with death. Lisa\nstill lived somewhere, hidden and afar; he thought of her as of the\nliving, but he did not recognize the girl he had once loved in that dim\npale shadow, cloaked in a nun's dress and encircled in misty clouds\nof incense. Lavretsky would not have recognized himself, could he have\nlooked at himself, as mentally he looked at Lisa. In the course of these\neight years he had passed that turning-point in life, which many never\npass, but without which no one can be a good man to the end; he had\nreally ceased to think of his own happiness, of his personal aims. He\nhad grown calm, and--why hide the truth?--he had grown old not only in\nface and in body, he had grown old in heart; to keep a young heart up to\nold age, as some say, is not only difficult, but almost ridiculous;\nhe may well be content who has not lost his belief in goodness, his\nsteadfast will, and his zeal for work. Lavretsky had good reason to\nbe content; he had become actually an excellent farmer, he had really\nlearnt to cultivate the land, and his labours were not only for himself;\nhe had, to the best of his powers, secured on a firm basis the welfare\nof his peasants.\n\nLavretsky went out of the house into the garden, and sat down on the\nfamiliar garden seat. And on this loved spot, facing the house where for\nthe last time he had vainly stretched out his hand for the enchanted\ncup which frothed and sparkled with the golden wine of delight, he, a\nsolitary homeless wanderer, looked back upon his life, while the joyous\nshouts of the younger generation who were already filling his place\nfloated across the garden to him. His heart was sad, but not weighed\ndown, nor bitter; much there was to regret, nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\"Play away, be gay, grow strong, vigorous youth!\" he thought, and there\nwas no bitterness in his meditations; \"your life is before you, and for\nyou life will be easier; you have not, as we had, to find out a path for\nyourselves, to struggle, to fall, and to rise again in the dark; we had\nenough to do to last out--and how many of us did not last out?--but you\nneed only do your duty, work away, and the blessing of an old man be\nwith you. For me, after to-day, after these emotions, there remains to\ntake my leave at last,--and though sadly, without envy, without any dark\nfeelings, to say, in sight of the end, in sight of God who awaits me:\n'Welcome, lonely old age! burn out, useless life!'\"\n\nLavretsky quietly rose and quietly went away; no one noticed him, no one\ndetained him; the joyous cries sounded more loudly in the garden\nbehind the thick green wall of high lime-trees. He took his seat in the\ncarriage and bade the coachman drive home and not hurry the horses.\n\n\n\n\"And the end?\" perhaps the dissatisfied reader will inquire. \"What\nbecame of Lavretsky afterwards, and of Lisa?\" But what is there to tell\nof people who, though still alive, have withdrawn from the battlefield\nof life? They say, Lavretsky visited that remote convent where Lisa had\nhidden herself--that he saw her. Crossing over from choir to choir, she\nwalked close past him, moving with the even, hurried, but meek walk of\na nun; and she did not glance at him; only the eyelashes on the side\ntowards him quivered a little, only she bent her emaciated face lower,\nand the fingers of her clasped hands, entwined with her rosary, were\npressed still closer to one another. What were they both thinking, what\nwere they feeling? Who can know? who can say? There are such moments\nin life, there are such feelings... One can but point to them--and pass\nthem by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A House of Gentlefolk, by Ivan Turgenev\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HOUSE OF GENTLEFOLK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5721.txt or 5721.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/7\/2\/5721\/\n\nProduced by L.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":871,"split":"train"}
