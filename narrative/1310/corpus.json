{"ori_id":"9bfa931a5513a490a9cc14f4c5062f5edfbc0f32","title":"Catriona (novel)","context":"Catriona (novel)\n The book begins precisely where Kidnapped ends, at 2 PM on 25 August 1751, outside the British Linen Company in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nThe first part of the book recounts the attempts of the hero, David Balfour, to gain justice for James Stewart (James of the Glens), who has been arrested and charged with complicity in the Appin Murder. David makes a statement to a lawyer and goes on to meet William Grant of Prestongrange, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to press the case for James' innocence. However, his attempts fail as - after being reunited with Alan Breck - he is once again kidnapped and, this time, confined on the Bass Rock, an island in the Firth of Forth, until the trial is over, and James condemned to death. David also meets and falls in love with Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the daughter of James MacGregor Drummond, known as James More (who was Rob Roy's eldest son), also held in prison, whose escape she engineers. David also receives some education in the manners and morals of polite society from Barbara Grant, Prestongrange's daughter.\nIn the second part, David and Catriona travel to Holland, where David studies law at the University of Leyden. David takes Catriona under his protection (she having no money) until her father finds them. James More eventually arrives and proves something of a disappointment, drinking a great deal and showing no compunction against living off David's largesse. At this time, David learns of the death of his uncle Ebenezer, and thus gains knowledge that he has come into his full, substantial inheritance. David and Catriona, fast friends at this point, begin a series of misunderstandings that eventually drive her and James More away, though David sends payment to James in return for news of Catriona's welfare. James and Catriona find their way to Dunkirk in northern France. Meanwhile, Alan Breck joins David in Leyden, and he berates David for not understanding women.\nIt's this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them. Either they like the man, and then a' goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your breath \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ye can do naething. There's just the two sets of them \u00e2\u0080\u0093 them that would sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye're on. That's a' that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.\nProdded thus, and at an invitation from James More, David and Alan journey to Dunkirk to visit with James and Catriona. They all meet one evening at a remote inn and discover the following day that James has betrayed Alan (falsely convicted of the Appin murder) into the hands of a British warship anchored near the shore. The British attempt to capture Alan, who flees with David and Catriona, now reconciled and shamed by James More's ignominy. The three flee to Paris, where David and Catriona are married. James More dies from an illness, and David and Catriona return to Scotland to raise a family.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Catriona, by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Yet, when I remember the\ndays of our explorations, I am not without hope.  There should be left in\nour native city some seed of the elect; some long-legged, hot-headed\nyouth must repeat to-day our dreams and wanderings of so many years ago;\nhe will relish the pleasure, which should have been ours, to follow among\nnamed streets and numbered houses the country walks of David Balfour, to\nidentify Dean, and Silvermills, and Broughton, and Hope Park, and Pilrig,\nand poor old Lochend\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it still be standing, and the Figgate Whins\u00e2\u0080\u0094if\nthere be any of them left; or to push (on a long holiday) so far afield\nas Gillane or the Bass.  So, perhaps, his eye shall be opened to behold\nthe series of the generations, and he shall weigh with surprise his\nmomentous and nugatory gift of life.\n\nYou are still\u00e2\u0080\u0094as when first I saw, as when I last addressed you\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the\nvenerable city which I must always think of as my home.  And I have come\nso far; and the sights and thoughts of my youth pursue me; and I see like\na vision the youth of my father, and of his father, and the whole stream\nof lives flowing down there far in the north, with the sound of laughter\nand tears, to cast me out in the end, as by a sudden freshet, on these\nultimate islands.

Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I\nwas like a beggar-man by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my\nlast shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own\nhead for a crime with the news of which the country rang.  To-day I was\nserved heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me\ncarrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the\nsaying) the ball directly at my foot.\n\nThere were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail.\nThe first was the very difficult and deadly business I had still to\nhandle; the second, the place that I was in.  The tall, black city, and\nthe numbers and movement and noise of so many folk, made a new world for\nme, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands and the still country-sides\nthat I had frequented up to then.  The throng of the citizens in\nparticular abashed me.  Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son was short and small in the\ngirth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill\nqualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter.  It was plain, if I did\nso, I should but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set\nthem asking questions.  So that I behooved to come by some clothes of my\nown, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, and put my hand\non his arm as though we were a pair of friends.\n\nAt a merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out: none too\nfine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback; but comely\nand responsible, so that servants should respect me.  Thence to an\narmourer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in life.  I\nfelt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of defence) it\nmight be called an added danger.  The porter, who was naturally a man of\nsome experience, judged my accoutrement to be well chosen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaething kenspeckle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d {1} said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cplain, dacent claes.  As for the\nrapier, nae doubt it sits wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your degree; but an I had been you, I would\nhas waired my siller better-gates than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And he proposed I should\nbuy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back, that was a cousin of\nhis own, and made them \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinar endurable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I had other matters on my hand more pressing.  Here I was in this\nold, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-warren, not\nonly by the number of its indwellers, but the complication of its\npassages and holes.  It was, indeed, a place where no stranger had a\nchance to find a friend, let be another stranger.  Suppose him even to\nhit on the right close, people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses, he\nmight very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door.  The\nordinary course was to hire a lad they called a _caddie_, who was like a\nguide or pilot, led you where you had occasion, and (your errands being\ndone) brought you again where you were lodging.  But these caddies, being\nalways employed in the same sort of services, and having it for\nobligation to be well informed of every house and person in the city, had\ngrown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales of Mr.\nCampbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how they communicated one with another, what a rage of\ncuriosity they conceived as to their employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business, and how they\nwere like eyes and fingers to the police.  It would be a piece of little\nwisdom, the way I was now placed, to take such a ferret to my tails.  I\nhad three visits to make, all immediately needful: to my kinsman Mr.\nBalfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer that was Appin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agent, and to\nWilliam Grant Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord Advocate of Scotland.  Mr.\nBalfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was a non-committal visit; and besides (Pilrig being in the\ncountry) I made bold to find the way to it myself, with the help of my\ntwo legs and a Scots tongue.  But the rest were in a different case.  Not\nonly was the visit to Appin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agent, in the midst of the cry about the\nAppin murder, dangerous in itself, but it was highly inconsistent with\nthe other.  I was like to have a bad enough time of it with my Lord\nAdvocate Grant, the best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot from Appin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nagent, was little likely to mend my own affairs, and might prove the mere\nruin of friend Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  The whole thing, besides, gave me a look of\nrunning with the hare and hunting with the hounds that was little to my\nfancy.  I determined, therefore, to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and\nthe whole Jacobitical side of my business, and to profit for that purpose\nby the guidance of the porter at my side.  But it chanced I had scarce\ngiven him the address, when there came a sprinkle of rain\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing to\nhurt, only for my new clothes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we took shelter under a pend at the\nhead of a close or alley.\n\nBeing strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in.  The narrow\npaved way descended swiftly.  Prodigious tall houses sprang upon each\nside and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they rose.  At the top\nonly a ribbon of sky showed in.  By what I could spy in the windows, and\nby the respectable persons that passed out and in, I saw the houses to be\nvery well occupied; and the whole appearance of the place interested me\nlike a tale.\n\nI was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in time\nand clash of steel behind me.  Turning quickly, I was aware of a party of\narmed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man in a great coat.  He\nwalked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy, genteel and\ninsinuating: he waved his hands plausibly as he went, and his face was\nsly and handsome.  I thought his eye took me in, but could not meet it.\nThis procession went by to a door in the close, which a serving-man in a\nfine livery set open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the prisoner\nwithin, the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door.\n\nThere can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following of\nidle folk and children.  It was so now; but the more part melted away\nincontinent until but three were left.  One was a girl; she was dressed\nlike a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but\nher comrades or (I should say) followers were ragged gillies, such as I\nhad seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey.  They all\nspoke together earnestly in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my\nears for the sake of Alan; and, though the rain was by again, and my\nporter plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were, to\nlisten.  The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and\ncringeing before her, so that I made sure she was come of a chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse.  All the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by\nwhat I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among the\nparty; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for\nfine obeisances and empty sporrans.\n\nIt chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her face for the\nfirst time.  There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young\nwoman fits in a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, and stays there, and he could never tell you\nwhy; it just seems it was the thing he wanted.  She had wonderful bright\neyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part in it; but what I\nremember the most clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she\nturned.  And, whatever was the cause, I stood there staring like a fool.\nOn her side, as she had not known there was anyone so near, she looked at\nme a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely\ncivil.\n\nIt went through my country head she might be wondering at my new clothes;\nwith that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight of my colouring it is\nto be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for she moved her gillies\nfarther down the close, and they fell again to this dispute, where I\ncould hear no more of it.\n\nI had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and strong;\nand it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come forward, for I\nwas much in fear of mockery from the womenkind.  You would have thought I\nhad now all the more reason to pursue my common practice, since I had met\nthis young lady in the city street, seemingly following a prisoner, and\naccompanied with two very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen.  But there\nwas here a different ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been\nprying in her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, and at the top\nof my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow.  The beggar on\nhorseback could not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at least of it,\nnot by this young lady.\n\nI followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best that I\nwas able.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it only fair to myself to let you understand I\nhave no Gaelic.  It is true I was listening, for I have friends of my own\nacross the Highland line, and the sound of that tongue comes friendly;\nbut for your private affairs, if you had spoken Greek, I might have had\nmore guess at them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made me a little, distant curtsey.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no harm done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more agreeable).\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA cat may look at a king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not mean to offend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no skill of city manners; I\nnever before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh.  Take me\nfor a country lad\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I am; and I would rather I told you than you\nfound it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to\neach other on the causeway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you are landward {2}\nbred it will be different.  I am as landward as yourself; I am Highland,\nas you see, and think myself the farther from my home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not yet a week since I passed the line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLess than a\nweek ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBalwhither?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cries.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome ye from Balwhither!  The name of it makes\nall there is of me rejoice.  You will not have been long there, and not\nknown some of our friends or family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nreplied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if\nhe is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are fine people, and the place is a bonny place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere in the great world is such another!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cries; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am loving the\nsmell of that place and the roots that grow there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could be wishing\nI had brought you a spray of that heather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, though I did\nill to speak with you at the first, now it seems we have common\nacquaintance, I make it my petition you will not forget me.  David\nBalfour is the name I am known by.  This is my lucky day, when I have\njust come into a landed estate, and am not very long out of a deadly\nperil.  I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of\nBalwhidder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will yours for the sake of my lucky day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is not spoken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, with a great deal of haughtiness.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than a hundred years it has not gone upon men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongues, save for a\nblink.  I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace. {3}  Catriona Drummond is\nthe one I use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow indeed I knew where I was standing.  In all broad Scotland there was\nbut the one name proscribed, and that was the name of the Macgregors.\nYet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy, I plunged the\ndeeper in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think he will be one of your friends.  They called him\nRobin Oig.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid ye so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe met Rob?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI passed the night with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is a fowl of the night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a set of pipes there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso you may judge if the\ntime passed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should be no enemy, at all events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was his brother\nthere a moment since, with the red soldiers round him.  It is him that I\ncall father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you a daughter of James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the daughter that he has,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe daughter of a prisoner;\nthat I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk with strangers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English, to know\nwhat \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u009d (meaning by that himself) was to do about \u00e2\u0080\u009cta sneeshin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I\ntook some note of him for a short, bandy-legged, red-haired, big-headed\nman, that I was to know more of to my cost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can be none the day, Neil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow will you get\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098sneeshin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wanting siller!  It will teach you another time to be more\ncareful; and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil\nof the Tom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you I was in my lucky day.  Here I am,\nand a bank-porter at my tail.  And remember I have had the hospitality of\nyour own country of Balwhidder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not one of my people gave it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am owing your uncle at least for some springs\nupon the pipes.  Besides which, I have offered myself to be your friend,\nand you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will tell you what this is.  James More lies shackled in prison;\nbut this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the\nAdvocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that . . . ?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere they bring my father one time and another, for what purpose I have\nno thought in my mind; but it seems there is some hope dawned for him.\nAll this same time they will not let me be seeing him, nor yet him write;\nand we wait upon the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s street to catch him; and now we give him his\nsnuff as he goes by, and now something else.  And here is this son of\ntrouble, Neil, son of Duncan, has lost my four-penny piece that was to\nbuy that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will think his\ndaughter has forgotten him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him go about\nhis errand.  Then to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat sixpence came with me by Balwhidder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are a friend to the Gregara!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not like to deceive you, either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know very little\nof the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but since the while\nI have been standing in this close, I seem to know something of yourself;\nand if you will just say \u00e2\u0080\u0098a friend to Miss Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I will see you are\nthe less cheated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe one cannot be without the other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will even try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what will you be thinking of myself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be holding my\nhand to the first stranger!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not be without repaying it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere is it you stop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing not full\nthree hours in the city; but if you will give me your direction, I will\nbe so bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill I can trust you for that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need have little fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJames More could not bear it else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI stop beyond the\nvillage of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs.\nDrummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be glad to\nthank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I;\nand, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind, I made haste\nto say farewell.\n\nI could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made extraordinary\nfree upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise young lady would\nhave shown herself more backward.  I think it was the bank-porter that\nput me from this ungallant train of thought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, shooting\nout his lips.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no likely to gang far this gate.  A fule and his\nsiller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shune parted.  Eh, but ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a green callant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009can\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a\nveecious, tae!

In the inner chamber, which opened from it, a little\nbrisk man sat poring on a deed, from which he scarce raised his eyes on\nmy entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in the place, as though\nprepared to show me out and fall again to his studies.  This pleased me\nlittle enough; and what pleased me less, I thought the clerk was in a\ngood posture to overhear what should pass between us.\n\nI asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, if the question is equally fair, who may you\nbe yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never heard tell of my name nor of me either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I bring\nyou a token from a friend that you know well.  That you know well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nrepeated, lowering my voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut maybe are not just so keen to hear from\nat this present being.  And the bits of business that I have to propone\nto you are rather in the nature of being confidential.  In short, I would\nlike to think we were quite private.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe rose without more words, casting down his paper like a man\nill-pleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand, and shut to the\nhouse-door behind him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, returning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak out your mind and fear nothing;\nthough before you begin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cries out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you mine misgives me!  I\ntell you beforehand, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye.  A good\nname it is, and one it would ill-become my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son to lightly.  But\nI begin to grue at the sound of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is called Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid Balfour of Shaws.  As for him\nthat sent me, I will let his token speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And I showed the silver\nbutton.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut it in your pocket, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe need name no names.  The\ndeevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buckie, I ken the button of him!  And de\u00e2\u0080\u0099il hae\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!  Where is he\nnow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had some sure place (or\nthought he had) about the north side, where he was to lie until a ship\nwas found for him; and how and where he had appointed to be spoken with.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family\nof mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, dod!  I believe the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come now!  Get a ship\nfor him, quot\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he!  And who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to pay for it?  The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daft!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is my part of the affair, Mr. Stewart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a bag of\ngood money, and if more be wanted, more is to be had where it came from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask your politics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe need not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m as big a Whig as grows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStop a bit, stop a bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mr. Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this?  A Whig?\nThen why are you here with Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button? and what kind of a black-foot\ntraffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig?  Here is a forfeited\nrebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life, and\nye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Whig!  I\nhave no mind of any such Whigs before, though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kent plenty of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a forfeited rebel, the more\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the pity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\nfriend.  I can only wish he had been better guided.  And an accused\nmurderer, that he is too, for his misfortune; but wrongfully accused.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear you say so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than you are to hear me say so, before long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan Breck\nis innocent, and so is James.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe two cases hang together.  If Alan is out, James can\nnever be in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan, of the accident\nthat brought me present at the Appin murder, and the various passages of\nour escape among the heather, and my recovery of my estate.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, sir,\nyou have now the whole train of these events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand can see\nfor yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with the affairs of your\nfamily and friends, which (for all of our sakes) I wish had been plainer\nand less bloody.  You can see for yourself, too, that I have certain\npieces of business depending, which were scarcely fit to lay before a\nlawyer chosen at random.  No more remains, but to ask if you will\nundertake my service?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no great mind to it; but coming as you do with Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button, the\nchoice is scarcely left me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are your instructions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, and took up his pen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nI need not be repeating that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am little likely to forget it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nwould be ill for me to find a conveyance, but that should be no stick to\nyou.  It was two pounds five shillings and three-halfpence farthing\nsterling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe noted it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Mr. Henderland, a licensed preacher and\nmissionary in Ardgour, that I would like well to get some snuff into the\nhands of; and, as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in Appin (so\nnear by), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a job you could doubtless overtake with the other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much snuff are we to say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thinking of two pounds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lass Alison Hastie, in Lime Kilns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer that\nhelped Alan and me across the Forth.  I was thinking if I could get her a\ngood Sunday gown, such as she could wear with decency in her degree, it\nwould be an ease to my conscience; for the mere truth is, we owe her our\ntwo lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad so see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, making his\nnotes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nI.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges,\nI would be glad to know if I could get some spending-money back.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I lack\nmore; but having drawn so much the one day, I think it would have a very\nill appearance if I was back again seeking, the next.  Only be sure you\nhave enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I am very undesirous to meet with you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cautious, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Writer.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my\ndiscretion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said this with a plain sneer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to run the hazard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another\nservice I would ask, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to direct me to a lodging, for I have no\nroof to my head.  But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by\naccident, for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to get any\njealousy of our acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe may set your weary spirit at rest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never name your\nname, sir; and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be\nsympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI saw I had got to the wrong side of the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a braw day coming for him, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to\nlearn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to-morrow, when I\ncall on him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen ye _call_ on him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Mr. Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I daft, or are you!\nWhat takes ye near the Advocate!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, just to give myself up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009care ye making a mock of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I think you have allowed yourself some such\nfreedom with myself.  But I give you to understand once and for all that\nI am in no jesting spirit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor yet me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I give yon to understand (if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to\nbe the word) that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less.  You\ncome here to me with all sorts of propositions, which will put me in a\ntrain of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons\nthis many a day to come.  And then you tell me you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going straight out\nof my office to make your peace with the Advocate!  Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button here or\nAlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button there, the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further\nin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would take it with a little more temper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand perhaps we can\navoid what you object to.  I can see no way for it but to give myself up,\nbut perhaps you can see another; and if you could, I could never deny but\nwhat I would be rather relieved.  For I think my traffic with his\nlordship is little likely to agree with my health.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the one\nthing clear, that I have to give my evidence; for I hope it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll save\nAlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character (what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left of it), and James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, which is the more\nimmediate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was silent for a breathing-space, and then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nnever be allowed to give such evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to see about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m stiff-necked when I like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe muckle ass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Stewart, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s James they want; James has got to\nhang\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alan, too, if they could catch him\u00e2\u0080\u0094but James whatever!  Go near the\nAdvocate with any such business, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a way to\nmuzzle, ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think better of the Advocate than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Advocate be dammed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Campbells, man!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave the whole clanjamfry of them on your back; and so will the Advocate\ntoo, poor body!  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand!  If\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no fair way to stop your gab, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a foul one gaping.  They\ncan put ye in the dock, do ye no see that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, and stabbed me with\none finger in the leg.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was told that same no further back than this morning by\nanother lawyer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who was he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Stewart, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe spoke sense at least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told I must be excused from naming him, for he was a decent stout old\nWhig, and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nwhat said you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the\nhouse of Shaws.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and so ye will hang!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hang beside James Stewart.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your fortune told.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope better of it yet than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I could never deny\nthere was a risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRisk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, and then sat silent again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to thank you for\nyour staunchness to my friends, to whom you show a very good spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsays, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have the strength to stand by it.  But I warn you that\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wading deep.  I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put myself in your place (me that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nStewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah.\nRisk? ay, I take over-many; but to be tried in court before a Campbell\njury and a Campbell judge, and that in a Campbell country and upon a\nCampbell quarrel\u00e2\u0080\u0094think what you like of me, Balfour, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a different way of thinking, I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was brought up\nto this one by my father before me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I would not have you judge me over-sorely.  My case is dooms hard.\nSee, sir, ye tell me ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a Whig: I wonder what I am.  No Whig to be\nsure; I couldnae be just that.  But\u00e2\u0080\u0094laigh in your ear, man\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m maybe no\nvery keen on the other side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that a fact?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I would think of a man of your\nintelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHut! none of your whillywhas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d {4} cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intelligence upon\nboth sides.  But for my private part I have no particular desire to harm\nKing George; and as for King James, God bless him! he does very well for\nme across the water.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a lawyer, ye see: fond of my books and my\nbottle, a good plea, a well-drawn deed, a crack in the Parliament House\nwith other lawyer bodies, and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at\ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099en.  Where do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, man!  And yet I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Hieland born, and when\nthe clan pipes, who but me has to dance!  The clan and the name, that\ngoes by all.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just what you said yourself; my father learned it to\nme, and a bonny trade I have of it.  Treason and traitors, and the\nsmuggling of them out and in; and the French recruiting, weary fall it!\nand the smuggling through of the recruits; and their pleas\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sorrow of\ntheir pleas!  Here have I been moving one for young Ardsheil, my cousin;\nclaimed the estate under the marriage contract\u00e2\u0080\u0094a forfeited estate!  I\ntold them it was nonsense: muckle they cared!  And there was I cocking\nbehind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself, for it\nwas fair ruin to the pair of us\u00e2\u0080\u0094a black mark, _disaffected_, branded on\nour hurdies, like folk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s names upon their kye!  And what can I do?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a\nStewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan and family.  Then no later by\nthan yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle.\nWhat for?  I ken fine: Act of 1736: recruiting for King Lewie.  And\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll whistle me in to be his lawyer, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be another\nblack mark on my chara\u00e2\u0080\u0099ter!  I tell you fair: if I but kent the heid of a\nHebrew word from the hurdies of it, be dammed but I would fling the whole\nthing up and turn minister!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather a hard position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDooms hard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes me think so much of\nye\u00e2\u0080\u0094you that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Stewart\u00e2\u0080\u0094to stick your head so deep in Stewart business.\nAnd for what, I do not know: unless it was the sense of duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope it will be that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a grand quality.  But here is my clerk back; and,\nby your leave, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pick a bit of dinner, all the three of us.  When\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you the direction of a very decent man, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nvery fain to have you for a lodger.  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fill your pockets to ye,\nforbye, out of your ain bag.  For this business\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not be near as dear as\nye suppose\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even the ship part of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoot, ye neednae mind for Robbie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Stewart, too, puir\ndeevil! and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking Papists\nthan what he has hairs upon his face.  Why, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Robin that manages that\nbranch of my affairs.  Who will we have now, Rob, for across the water!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be Andie Scougal, in the _Thristle_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Rob.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw\nHoseason the other day, but it seems he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wanting the ship.  Then\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be Tam Stobo; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m none so sure of Tam.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him\ncolloguing with some gey queer acquaintances; and if was anybody\nimportant, I would give Tam the go-by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe head\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth two hundred pounds, Robin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGosh, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no be Alan Breck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the clerk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeary winds! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sayrious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Robin.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try Andie, then;\nAndie\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a big business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I observed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no end to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a name your clerk mentioned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoseason.  That must\nbe my man, I think: Hoseason, of the brig _Covenant_.  Would you set your\ntrust on him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe didnae behave very well to you and Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Stewart; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut my\nmind of the man in general is rather otherwise.  If he had taken Alan on\nboard his ship on an agreement, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my notion he would have proved a\njust dealer.  How say ye, Rob?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the clerk.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would\nlippen to {5} Eli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay, if it was the Chevalier, or Appin himsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was him that brought the doctor, wasnae\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the master.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was the very man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the clerk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think he took the doctor back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Stewart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, with his sporran full!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Robin.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Eli kent of that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d {6}\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it seems it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to ken folk rightly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr. Balfour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the\nWriter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\u00e2\u0080\u0094I GO TO PILRIG\n\n\nThe next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I was up\nand into my new clothes; and no sooner the breakfast swallowed, than I\nwas forth on my adventurers.  Alan, I could hope, was fended for; James\nwas like to be a more difficult affair, and I could not but think that\nenterprise might cost me dear, even as everybody said to whom I had\nopened my opinion.  It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only\nto cast myself down; that I had clambered up, through so many and hard\ntrials, to be rich, to be recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword to\nmy side, all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the worst\nkind of suicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charges.\n\nWhat was I doing it for? I asked, as I went down the high Street and out\nnorth by Leith Wynd.  First I said it was to save James Stewart; and no\ndoubt the memory of his distress, and his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cries, and a word or so\nI had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly.  At the same\ntime I reflected that it was (or ought to be) the most indifferent matter\nto my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, whether James died in his bed or from a scaffold.  He\nwas Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin, to be sure; but so far as regarded Alan, the best\nthing would be to lie low, and let the King, and his Grace of Argyll, and\nthe corbie crows, pick the bones of his kinsman their own way.  Nor could\nI forget that, while we were all in the pot together, James had shown no\nsuch particular anxiety whether for Alan or me.\n\nNext it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice: and I thought\nthat a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we dwelt in polities,\nat some discomfort to each one of us) the main thing of all must still be\njustice, and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole\ncommunity.  Next, again, it was the Accuser of the Brethren that gave me\na turn of his argument; bade me think shame for pretending myself\nconcerned in these high matters, and told me I was but a prating vain\nchild, who had spoken big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and held\nmyself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness.  Nay, and he\nhit me with the other end of the stick; for he accused me of a kind of\nartful cowardice, going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase\ngreater safety.  No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself, I\nmight any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officer, and be\nrecognised, and dragged into the Appin murder by the heels; and, no\ndoubt, in case I could manage my declaration with success, I should\nbreathe more free for ever after.  But when I looked this argument full\nin the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of.  As for the rest, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\nare the two roads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand both go to the same place.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nunjust that James should hang if I can save him; and it would be\nridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lucky\nfor James of the Glens that I have boasted beforehand; and none so\nunlucky for myself, because now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m committed to do right.  I have the\nname of a gentleman and the means of one; it would be a poor duty that I\nwas wanting in the essence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit,\nand said a prayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack, and\nthat I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle, and come\noff again scatheless, as so many do.\n\nThis train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion; though\nit was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me,\nnor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble on the ladder of the\ngallows.  It was a plain, fair morning, but the wind in the east.  The\nlittle chill of it sang in my blood, and gave me a feeling of the autumn,\nand the dead leaves, and dead folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bodies in their graves.  It seemed\nthe devil was in it, if I was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for\nother folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 affairs.  On the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not\nthe customary time of year for that diversion, some children were crying\nand running with their kites.  These toys appeared very plain against the\nsky; I remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then\nplump among the whins; and I thought to myself at sight of it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\ngoes Davie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMy way lay over Mouter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hill, and through an end of a clachan on the\nbraeside among fields.  There was a whirr of looms in it went from house\nto house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours that I saw at the\ndoorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found out later that this was\nPicardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen\nCompany.  Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a\nlittle beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in\nchains.  They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them,\nthe chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks\nand cried.  The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my\nfears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in\ndiscomfort.  And, as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what\nshould I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it,\nand nodded, and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are these two, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, and pointed to the corpses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA blessing on your precious face!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwa joes {7} o\u00e2\u0080\u0099mine:\njust two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my old joes, my hinny dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did they suffer for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOu, just for the guid cause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAften I spaed to them the way\nthat it would end.  Twa shillin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Scots: no pickle mair; and there are twa\nbonny callants hingin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for \u00e2\u0080\u0099t!  They took it frae a wean {8} belanged to\nBrouchton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand did they come to\nsuch a figure for so poor a business?  This is to lose all indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your loof, {9} hinny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let me spae your weird to\nye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see far enough the way I am.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unco thing\nto see too far in front.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI read it in your bree,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bonnie lassie that has\nbricht een, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wee man in a braw coat, and a big man in a\npouthered wig, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the shadow of the wuddy, {10} joe, that lies\nbraid across your path.  Gie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your loof, hinny, and let Auld Merren spae\nit to ye bonny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter of\nJames More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch creature, casting\nher a baubee, which she continued to sit and play with under the moving\nshadows of the hanged.\n\nMy way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant to\nme but for this encounter.  The old rampart ran among fields, the like of\nthem I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture; I was pleased,\nbesides, to be so far in the still countryside; but the shackles of the\ngibbet clattered in my head; and the mope and mows of the old witch, and\nthe thought of the dead men, hag-rode my spirits.  To hang on a gallows,\nthat seemed a hard case; and whether a man came to hang there for two\nshillings Scots, or (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty, once\nhe was tarred and shackled and hung up, the difference seemed small.\nThere might David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on their errands and\nthink light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a leg-foot and spae their\nfortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and look to the other aide,\nand hold a nose.  I saw them plain, and they had grey eyes, and their\nscreens upon their heads were of the Drummed colours.\n\nI was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty resolved, when\nI came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside\namong some brave young woods.  The laird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse was standing saddled at\nthe door as I came up, but himself was in the study, where he received me\nin the midst of learned works and musical instruments, for he was not\nonly a deep philosopher but much of a musician.  He greeted me at first\npretty well, and when he had read Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter, placed himself\nobligingly at my disposal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is it, cousin David!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009csince it appears that we are\ncousins\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is this that I can do for you!  A word to Prestongrange!\nDoubtless that is easily given.  But what should be the word?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I were to tell you my whole story the way it\nfell out, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my opinion (and it was Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before me) that you\nwould be very little made up with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nnothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but just the common\ninfirmities of mankind.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098The guilt of Adam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first sin, the want of\noriginal righteousness, and the corruption of my whole nature,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 so much I\nmust answer for, and I hope I have been taught where to look for help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nsaid; for I judged from the look of the man he would think the better of\nme if I knew my questions. {11}  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut in the way of worldly honour I have\nno great stumble to reproach myself with; and my difficulties have\nbefallen me very much against my will and (by all that I can see) without\nmy fault.  My trouble is to have become dipped in a political\ncomplication, which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge\nof.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, very well, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am pleased to see you are all\nthat Rankeillor represented.  And for what you say of political\ncomplications, you do me no more than justice.  It is my study to be\nbeyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it.  The question is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow, if I am to know nothing of the matter, I can very well\nassist you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI propose you should write to his lordship, that I am\na young man of reasonable good family and of good means: both of which I\nbelieve to be the case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Balfour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I count that a\nwarran-dice against all deadly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo which you might add (if you will take my word for so much) that I am\na good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of which will do you any harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Balfour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of\ngreat moment, connected with His Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service and the administration\nof justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I am not to hear the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the laird, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not take upon\nmyself to qualify its weight.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Great moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 therefore falls, and\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099 along with it.  For the rest I might express myself much as you\npropose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen\nI would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps\ntell for my protection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProtection?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor your protection!  Here is a phrase that\nsomewhat dampens me.  If the matter be so dangerous, I own I would be a\nlittle loath to move in it blindfold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps that would be the best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Appin murder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe held up both his hands.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSirs! sirs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he.\n\nI thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost my\nhelper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me explain. . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI decline _in\ntoto_ to hear more of it.  For your name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake and Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and\nperhaps a little for your own, I will do what I can to help you; but I\nwill hear no more upon the facts.  And it is my first clear duty to warn\nyou.  These are deep waters, Mr. David, and you are a young man.  Be\ncautious and think twice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that, Mr.\nBalfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will direct your attention again to Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered his approval of that\nwhich I design.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; and then again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well!  I will do what I can\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There with he took a pen and paper, sat a while in thought,\nand began to write with much consideration.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand that\nRankeillor approved of what you have in mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked presently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the name to go in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his writing.\nPresently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and addressed me\nagain.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow here, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a letter of introduction,\nwhich I will seal without closing, and give into your hands open, as the\nform requires.  But, since I am acting in the dark, I will just read it\nto you, so that you may see if it will secure your end\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n                                             \u00e2\u0080\u009cPILRIG, _August_ 26th, 1751.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0094This is to bring to your notice my namesake and cousin,\n    David Balfour Esquire of Shaws, a young gentleman of unblemished\n    descent and good estate.  He has enjoyed, besides, the more valuable\n    advantages of a godly training, and his political principles are all\n    that your lordship can desire.  I am not in Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence,\n    but I understand him to have a matter to declare, touching His\n    Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service and the administration of justice; purposes for\n    which your Lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zeal is known.  I should add that the young\n    gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intention is known to and approved by some of his\n    friends, who will watch with hopeful anxiety the event of his success\n    or failure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhereupon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Mr. Balfour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have subscribed myself with the\nusual compliments.  You observe I have said \u00e2\u0080\u0098some of your friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099; I\nhope you can justify my plural?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerfectly, sir; my purpose is known and approved by more than one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nI.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd your letter, which I take a pleasure to thank you for, is all I\ncould have hoped.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was all I could squeeze out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand from what I know of the\nmatter you design to meddle in, I can only pray God that it may prove\nsufficient.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\u00e2\u0080\u0094LORD ADVOCATE PRESTONGRANGE\n\n\nMy kinsman kept me to a meal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor the honour of the roof,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and\nI believe I made the better speed on my return.  I had no thought but to\nbe done with the next stage, and have myself fully committed; to a person\ncircumstanced as I was, the appearance of closing a door on hesitation\nand temptation was itself extremely tempting; and I was the more\ndisappointed, when I came to Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, to be informed he was\nabroad.  I believe it was true at the moment, and for some hours after;\nand then I have no doubt the Advocate came home again, and enjoyed\nhimself in a neighbouring chamber among friends, while perhaps the very\nfact of my arrival was forgotten.  I would have gone away a dozen times,\nonly for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out of hand\nand be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience.  At first I\nread, for the little cabinet where I was left contained a variety of\nbooks.  But I fear I read with little profit; and the weather falling\ncloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than usual, and my cabinet being\nlighted with but a loophole of a window, I was at last obliged to desist\nfrom this diversion (such as it was), and pass the rest of my time of\nwaiting in a very burthensome vacuity.  The sound of people talking in a\nnear chamber, the pleasant note of a harpsichord, and once the voice of a\nlady singing, bore me a kind of company.\n\nI do not know the hour, but the darkness was long come, when the door of\nthe cabinet opened, and I was aware, by the light behind him, of a tall\nfigure of a man upon the threshold.  I rose at once.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs anybody there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho in that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord Advocate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you been here long?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the first I hear of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, with a chuckle.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lads\nmust have forgotten you.  But you are in the bit at last, for I am\nPrestongrange.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying, he passed before me into the next room, whither (upon his\nsign) I followed him, and where he lit a candle and took his place before\na business-table.  It was a long room, of a good proportion, wholly lined\nwith books.  That small spark of light in a corner struck out the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhandsome person and strong face.  He was flushed, his eye watered and\nsparkled, and before he sat down I observed him to sway back and forth.\nNo doubt, he had been supping liberally; but his mind and tongue were\nunder full control.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sir, sit ye down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let us see Pilrig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking up and bowing\nwhen he came to my name; but at the last words I thought I observed his\nattention to redouble, and I made sure he read them twice.  All this\nwhile you are to suppose my heart was beating, for I had now crossed my\nRubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, when he\nhad done.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me offer you a glass of claret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce be fair on me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nI.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come here, as the letter will have mentioned, on a business\nof some gravity to myself; and, as I am little used with wine, I might be\nthe sooner affected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall be the judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you will permit, I believe I\nwill even have the bottle in myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal, bringing wine and\nglasses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are sure you will not join me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the Advocate.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, here is\nto our better acquaintance!  In what way can I serve you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should, perhaps, begin by telling you, my lord, that I am here at your\nown pressing invitation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have the advantage of me somewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I profess I think\nI never heard of you before this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, my lord; the name is, indeed, new to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet you\nhave been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance, and\nhave declared the same in public.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you would afford me a clue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no Daniel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will perhaps serve for such,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I was in a jesting\nhumour\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is far from the case\u00e2\u0080\u0094I believe I might lay a claim on your\nlordship for two hundred pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what sense?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the sense of rewards offered for my person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat straight up in the\nchair where he had been previously lolling.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat am I to understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_A tall strong lad of about eighteen_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I quoted, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_speaks like a\nLowlander and has no beard_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI recognise those words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich, if you have come here with\nany ill-judged intention of amusing yourself, are like to prove extremely\nprejudicial to your safety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy purpose in this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis just entirely as serious as life and\ndeath, and you have understood me perfectly.  I am the boy who was\nspeaking with Glenure when he was shot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim to be innocent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe inference is clear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a very loyal subject to King\nGeorge, but if I had anything to reproach myself with, I would have had\nmore discretion than to walk into your den.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis horrid crime, Mr. Balfour, is of a\ndye which cannot permit any clemency.  Blood has been barbarously shed.\nIt has been shed in direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole frame\nof laws, by those who are their known and public oppugnants.  I take a\nvery high sense of this.  I will not deny that I consider the crime as\ndirectly personal to his Majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd unfortunately, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, a little drily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdirectly personal\nto another great personage who may be nameless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you mean anything by those words, I must tell you I consider them\nunfit for a good subject; and were they spoke publicly I should make it\nmy business to take note of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not appear to me to\nrecognise the gravity of your situation, or you would be more careful not\nto pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of justice.\nJustice, in this country, and in my poor hands, is no respecter of\npersons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou give me too great a share in my own speech, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndid but repeat the common talk of the country, which I have heard\neverywhere, and from men of all opinions as I came along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk in\nnot to be listened to, how much less repeated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the Advocate.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nI acquit you of an ill intention.  That nobleman, whom we all honour, and\nwho has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity, sits\ntoo high to be reached by these aspersions.  The Duke of Argyle\u00e2\u0080\u0094you see\nthat I deal plainly with you\u00e2\u0080\u0094takes it to heart as I do, and as we are\nboth bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his\nMajesty; and I could wish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally\nclean of family rancour.  But from the accident that this is a Campbell\nwho has fallen martyr to his duty\u00e2\u0080\u0094as who else but the Campbells have ever\nput themselves foremost on that path?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I may say it, who am no\nCampbell\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that the chief of that great house happens (for all our\nadvantages) to be the present head of the College of Justice, small minds\nand disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the country;\nand I find a young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill-advised as to make\nhimself their echo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So much he spoke with a very oratorical delivery,\nas if in court, and then declined again upon the manner of a gentleman.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll this apart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt now remains that I should learn what I am\nto do with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your\nlordship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the Advocate.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, you see, you come to me well\nrecommended.  There is a good honest Whig name to this letter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he,\npicking it up a moment from the table.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\u00e2\u0080\u0094extra-judicially, Mr.\nBalfour\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is always the possibility of some arrangement, I tell you,\nand I tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your guard, your\nfate lies with me singly.  In such a matter (be it said with reverence) I\nam more powerful than the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Majesty; and should you please me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and of\ncourse satisfy my conscience\u00e2\u0080\u0094in what remains to be held of our interview,\nI tell you it may remain between ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeaning how?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if you give\nsatisfaction, no soul need know so much as that you visited my house; and\nyou may observe that I do not even call my clerk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI saw what way he was driving.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose it is needless anyone should\nbe informed upon my visit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough the precise nature of my\ngains by that I cannot see.  I am not at all ashamed of coming here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have no cause to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, encouragingly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNor yet (if you are\ncareful) to fear the consequences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeaking under your correction, I am not very easy to\nbe frightened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to the\ninterrogation; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the\nquestions I shall ask you.  It may consist very immediately with your\nsafety.  I have a great discretion, it is true, but there are bounds to\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall try to follow your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt appears\nyou were present, by the way, in the wood of Lettermore at the moment of\nthe fatal shot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas this by accident?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy accident,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow came you in speech with Colin Campbell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.\n\nI observed he did not write this answer down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cH\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had forgotten that.  And do you know, Mr.\nBalfour, I would dwell, if I were you, as little as might be on your\nrelations with these Stewarts.  It might be found to complicate our\nbusiness.  I am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were equally material in\nsuch a case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forget we are now trying these Stewarts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, with great\nsignificance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we should ever come to be trying you, it will be very\ndifferent; and I shall press these very questions that I am now willing\nto glide upon.  But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprecognition that you ran immediately up the brae.  How came that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot immediately, my lord, and the cause was my seeing of the murderer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw him, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs plain as I see your lordship, though not so near hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should know him again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as to overtake him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas he alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no one else in that neighbourhood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a wood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Advocate laid his pen down.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we are playing at cross\npurposes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich you will find to prove a very ill amusement\nfor yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI content myself with following your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, and answering\nwhat I am asked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe so wise as to bethink yourself in time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI use you with the\nmost anxious tenderness, which you scarce seem to appreciate, and which\n(unless you be more careful) may prove to be in vain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to be mistaken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nreplied, with something of a falter, for I saw we were come to grips at\nlast.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am here to lay before you certain information, by which I shall\nconvince you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of Glenure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting with pursed lips,\nand blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nat last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as free of the charge of considering my own\ninterests in this matter as your lordship.  As God judges me, I have but\nthe one design, and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go\nclear.  If in pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndispleasure, I must bear it as I may.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and for a while\ngazed upon me steadily.  I was surprised to see a great change of gravity\nfallen upon his face, and I could have almost thought he was a little\npale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are either very simple, or extremely the reverse, and I see that I\nmust deal with you more confidentially,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a political\ncase\u00e2\u0080\u0094ah, yes, Mr. Balfour! whether we like it or no, the case is\npolitical\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I tremble when I think what issues may depend from it.  To\na political case, I need scarce tell a young man of your education, we\napproach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only.\n_Salus populi suprema lex_ is a maxim susceptible of great abuse, but it\nhas that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature: I mean\nit has the force of necessity.  I will open this out to you, if you will\nallow me, at more length.  You would have me believe\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your pardon, my lord, I would have you to believe nothing but that\nwhich I can prove,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTut! tut; young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe not so pragmatical, and suffer\na man who might be your father (if it was nothing more) to employ his own\nimperfect language, and express his own poor thoughts, even when they\nhave the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  You would have\nme to believe Breck innocent.  I would think this of little account, the\nmore so as we cannot catch our man.  But the matter of Breck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocence\nshoots beyond itself.  Once admitted, it would destroy the whole\npresumptions of our case against another and a very different criminal; a\nman grown old in treason, already twice in arms against his king and\nalready twice forgiven; a fomentor of discontent, and (whoever may have\nfired the shot) the unmistakable original of the deed in question.  I\nneed not tell you that I mean James Stewart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James is\nwhat I am here to declare in private to your lordship, and what I am\nprepared to establish at the trial by my testimony,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat (in that case) your testimony will not be called by me, and I\ndesire you to withhold it altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are at the head of Justice in this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you\npropose to me a crime!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I press on you a political necessity.  Patriotism is not\nalways moral in the formal sense.  You might be glad of it, I think: it\nis your own protection; the facts are heavy against you; and if I am\nstill trying to except you from a very dangerous place, it is in part of\ncourse because I am not insensible to your honesty in coming here; in\npart because of Pilrig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter; but in part, and in chief part, because\nI regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial duty only\nsecond.  For the same reason\u00e2\u0080\u0094I repeat it to you in the same frank words\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ndo not want your testimony.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I express only the\nplain sense of our position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if your lordship has no need\nof my testimony, I believe the other side would be extremely blythe to\nget it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPrestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are\nnot so young,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what you must remember very clearly the year\n\u00e2\u0080\u009945 and the shock that went about the country.  I read in Pilrig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter\nthat you are sound in Kirk and State.  Who saved them in that fatal year?\nI do not refer to His Royal Highness and his ramrods, which were\nextremely useful in their day; but the country had been saved and the\nfield won before ever Cumberland came upon Drummossie.  Who saved it?  I\nrepeat; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of our\ncivil institutions?  The late Lord President Culloden, for one; he played\na man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, and small thanks he got for it\u00e2\u0080\u0094even as I, whom you see\nbefore you, straining every nerve in the same service, look for no reward\nbeyond the conscience of my duties done.  After the President, who else?\nYou know the answer as well as I do; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis partly a scandal, and you\nglanced at it yourself, and I reproved you for it, when you first came\nin.  It was the Duke and the great clan of Campbell.  Now here is a\nCampbell foully murdered, and that in the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service.  The Duke and I\nare Highlanders.  But we are Highlanders civilised, and it is not so with\nthe great mass of our clans and families.  They have still savage virtues\nand defects.  They are still barbarians, like these Stewarts; only the\nCampbells were barbarians on the right side, and the Stewarts were\nbarbarians on the wrong.  Now be you the judge.  The Campbells expect\nvengeance.  If they do not get it\u00e2\u0080\u0094if this man James escape\u00e2\u0080\u0094there will be\ntrouble with the Campbells.  That means disturbance in the Highlands,\nwhich are uneasy and very far from being disarmed: the disarming is a\nfarce. . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can bear you out in that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful enemy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\npursued his lordship, holding out a finger as he paced; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I give you\nmy word we may have a \u00e2\u0080\u009945 again with the Campbells on the other side.  To\nprotect the life of this man Stewart\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is forfeit already on\nhalf-a-dozen different counts if not on this\u00e2\u0080\u0094do you propose to plunge\nyour country in war, to jeopardise the faith of your fathers, and to\nexpose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent persons? . . .\nThese are considerations that weigh with me, and that I hope will\nweigh no less with yourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your country,\ngood government, and religious truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\ntry on my side to be no less honest.  I believe your policy to be sound.\nI believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship; I believe you may\nhave laid them on your conscience when you took the oath of the high\noffice which you hold.  But for me, who am just a plain man\u00e2\u0080\u0094or scarce a\nman yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094the plain duties must suffice.  I can think but of two things, of\na poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death, and\nof the cries and tears of his wife that still tingle in my head.  I\ncannot see beyond, my lord.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way that I am made.  If the country\nhas to fall, it has to fall.  And I pray God, if this be wilful\nblindness, that He may enlighten me before too late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an unexpected obstacle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, aloud, but to himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how is your lordship to dispose of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I wished,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know that you might sleep in gaol?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have slept in worse places.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is one thing appears very plainly from\nour interview, that I may rely on your pledged word.  Give me your honour\nthat you will be wholly secret, not only on what has passed to-night, but\nin the matter of the Appin case, and I let you go free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will give it till to-morrow or any other near day that you may please\nto set,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not be thought too wily; but if I gave the\npromise without qualification your lordship would have attained his end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no thought to entrap you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sure of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow is the Sabbath.  Come to me on\nMonday by eight in the morning, and give me your promise until then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFreely given, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd with regard to what has fallen\nfrom yourself, I will give it for an long as it shall please God to spare\nyour days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will observe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said next, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have made no employment of\nmenaces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was like your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nobility,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I am not altogether\nso dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you have not\nuttered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood-night to you.  May you sleep well, for I think it\nis more than I am like to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that he sighed, took up a candle, and gave me his conveyance as far\nas the street door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\u00e2\u0080\u0094IN THE ADVOCATE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S HOUSE\n\n\nThe next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I had long looked\nforward to, to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers, all well\nknown to me already by the report of Mr Campbell.  Alas! and I might just\nas well have been at Essendean, and sitting under Mr. Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy\nself! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt continually on the\ninterview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me from all attention.  I was\nindeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the divines than by the\nspectacle of the thronged congregation in the churches, like what I\nimagined of a theatre or (in my then disposition) of an assize of trial;\nabove all at the West Kirk, with its three tiers of galleries, where I\nwent in the vain hope that I might see Miss Drummond.\n\nOn the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and was very\nwell pleased with the result.  Thence to the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, where the red\ncoats of the soldiers showed again about his door, making a bright place\nin the close.  I looked about for the young lady and her gillies: there\nwas never a sign of them.  But I was no sooner shown into the cabinet or\nantechamber where I had spent so wearyful a time upon the Saturday, than\nI was aware of the tall figure of James More in a corner.  He seemed a\nprey to a painful uneasiness, reaching forth his feet and hands, and his\neyes speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the small\nchamber, which recalled to me with a sense of pity the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wretched\nsituation.  I suppose it was partly this, and partly my strong continuing\ninterest in his daughter, that moved me to accost him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive you a good-morning, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a good-morning to you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou bide tryst with Prestongrange?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman be more\nagreeable than mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was his reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose you pass before\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll pass before me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a shrug and a gesture upward of the\nopen hands.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not always so, sir, but times change.  It was not so\nwhen the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and the virtues of the\nsoldier might sustain themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my\ndander strangely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Mr. Macgregor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand the main thing for a soldier\nis to be silent, and the first of his virtues never to complain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have my name, I perceive\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094he bowed to me with his arms\ncrossed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthough it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one I must not use myself.  Well, there is a\npublicity\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards\nof my enemies.  I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I\nknow not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you know not in the least, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor yet anybody else; but\nthe name I am called, if you care to hear it, is Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a good name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, civilly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are many decent folk\nthat use it.  And now that I call to mind, there was a young gentleman,\nyour namesake, that marched surgeon in the year \u00e2\u0080\u009945 with my battalion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, for I\nwas ready for the surgeon now.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James More.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd since I have been fellow-soldier\nwith your kinsman, you must suffer me to grasp your hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on me the while as\nthough he had found a brother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese are changed days since your cousin and I heard the\nballs whistle in our lugs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he was a very far-away cousin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, drily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I ought to\ntell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit makes no change.  And you\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do not think you\nwere out yourself, sir\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have no clear mind of your face, which is one\nnot probable to be forgotten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the year you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting skelped in the\nparish school,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo young!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, then, you will never be able to think what\nthis meeting is to me.  In the hour of my adversity, and here in the\nhouse of my enemy, to meet in with the blood of an old brother-in-arms\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nheartens me, Mr. Balfour, like the skirling of the highland pipes!  Sir,\nthis is a sad look back that many of us have to make: some with falling\ntears.  I have lived in my own country like a king; my sword, my\nmountains, and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me.  Now\nI lie in a stinking dungeon; and do you know, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on,\ntaking my arm and beginning to lead me about, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know, sir, that I\nlack mere ne_cess_aries?  The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my\nresources.  I lie, as you know, sir, on a trumped-up charge, of which I\nam as innocent as yourself.  They dare not bring me to my trial, and in\nthe meanwhile I am held naked in my prison.  I could have wished it was\nyour cousin I had met, or his brother Baith himself.  Either would, I\nknow, have been rejoiced to help me; while a comparative stranger like\nyourself\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly\nvein, or the very short and grudging answers that I made to him.  There\nwere times when I was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change;\nbut whether it was from shame or pride\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether it was for my own sake or\nCatriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether it was because I thought him no fit father for his\ndaughter, or because I resented that grossness of immediate falsity that\nclung about the man himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094the thing was clean beyond me.  And I was\nstill being wheedled and preached to, and still being marched to and fro,\nthree steps and a turn, in that small chamber, and had already, by some\nvery short replies, highly incensed, although not finally discouraged, my\nbeggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway and bade me eagerly\ninto his big chamber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engagements,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that you may not sit\nempty-handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters, of\nwhom perhaps you may have heard, for I think they are more famous than\npapa.  This way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe led me into another long room above, where a dry old lady sat at a\nframe of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I suppose) in\nScotland stood together by a window.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is my new friend, Mr Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, presenting me by the arm,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid, here is my sister, Miss Grant, who is so good as keep my house\nfor me, and will be very pleased if she can help you.  And here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nhe, turning to the three younger ladies, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere are my _three braw\ndauchters_.  A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie: which of the three is the\nbest favoured?  And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound\nhonest Alan Ramsay\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well, cried out against\nthis sally, which (as I was acquainted with the verses he referred to)\nbrought shame into my own check.  It seemed to me a citation unpardonable\nin a father, and I was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while\nthey reproved, or made believe to.\n\nUnder cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber, and I\nwas left, like a fish upon dry land, in that very unsuitable society.  I\ncould never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was\neminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have\nso long a patience with me.  The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery,\nonly looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and especially\nthe eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a score of\nattentions which I was very ill able to repay.  It was all in vain to\ntell myself I was a young follow of some worth as well as a good estate,\nand had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the eldest not so\nmuch older than myself, and no one of them by any probability half as\nlearned.  Reasoning would not change the fact; and there were times when\nthe colour came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the first\ntime.\n\nThe talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily, the eldest took\npity on my awkwardness, sat down to her instrument, of which she was a\npassed mistress, and entertained me for a while with playing and singing,\nboth in the Scots and in the Italian manners; this put me more at my\nease, and being reminded of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air that he had taught me in the hole\nnear Carriden, I made so bold as to whistle a bar or two, and ask if she\nknew that.\n\nShe shook her head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard a note of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhistle it\nall through.  And now once again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, after I had done so.\n\nThen she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise) instantly\nenriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as she played,\nwith a very droll expression and broad accent\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaenae I got just the lilt of it?\n    Isnae this the tune that ye whustled?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do the poetry too, only it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rhyme.  And\nthen again:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:\n    You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told her how much astonished I was by her genius.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do you call the name of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know the real name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just call it _Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at me directly in the face.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall call it _David\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the least like what your namesake of Israel\nplayed to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it,\nfor it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but melancholy music.  Your other name I do not like; so if you\nwas ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy that,\nMiss Grant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ever you should come to get hanged, I will set your\nlast dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and\nperil.  How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess.  It was\nplain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan, and\nthus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew that I\nstood under some criminal suspicion.  I judged besides that the harshness\nof her last speech (which besides she had followed up immediately with a\nvery noisy piece of music) was to put an end to the present conversation.\nI stood beside her, affecting to listen and admire, but truly whirled\naway by my own thoughts.  I have always found this young lady to be a\nlover of the mysterious; and certainly this first interview made a\nmystery that was beyond my plummet.  One thing I learned long after, the\nhours of the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been\nfound and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and the\ndeduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and most\nlikely in a continued correspondence with the last.  Hence this broad\nhint that was given me across the harpsichord.\n\nIn the midst of the piece of music, one of the younger misses, who was at\na window over the close, cried on her sisters to come quick, for there\nwas \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Grey eyes_ again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The whole family trooped there at once, and\ncrowded one another for a look.  The window whither they ran was in an\nodd corner of that room, gave above the entrance door, and flanked up the\nclose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome and see.  She is the most\nbeautiful creature!  She hangs round the close-head these last days,\nalways with some wretched-like gillies, and yet seems quite a lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or long.  I was afraid\nshe might have seen me there, looking down upon her from that chamber of\nmusic, and she without, and her father in the same house, perhaps begging\nfor his life with tears, and myself come but newly from rejecting his\npetitions.  But even that glance set me in a better conceit of myself and\nmuch less awe of the young ladies.  They were beautiful, that was beyond\nquestion, but Catriona was beautiful too, and had a kind of brightness in\nher like a coal of fire.  As much as the others cast me down, she lifted\nme up.  I remembered I had talked easily with her.  If I could make no\nhand of it with these fine maids, it was perhaps something their own\nfault.  My embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened with\na sense of fun; and when the aunt smiled at me from her embroidery, and\nthe three daughters unbent to me like a baby, all with \u00e2\u0080\u009cpapa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwritten on their faces, there were times when I could have found it in my\nheart to smile myself.\n\nPresently papa returned, the same kind, happy-like, pleasant-spoken man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must take Mr. Balfour away again; but I hope\nyou have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always\ngratified to find him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they each made me a little farthing compliment, and I was led away.\n\nIf this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance, it\nwas the worst of failures.  I was no such ass but what I understood how\npoor a figure I had made, and that the girls would be yawning their jaws\noff as soon as my stiff back was turned.  I felt I had shown how little I\nhad in me of what was soft and graceful; and I longed for a chance to\nprove that I had something of the other stuff, the stern and dangerous.\n\nWell, I was to be served to my desire, for the scene to which he was\nconducting me was of a different character.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\u00e2\u0080\u0094UMQUILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT\n\n\nThere was a man waiting us in Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s study, whom I distasted at\nthe first look, as we distaste a ferret or an earwig.  He was bitter\nugly, but seemed very much of a gentleman; had still manners, but capable\nof sudden leaps and violences; and a small voice, which could ring out\nshrill and dangerous when he so desired.\n\nThe Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, Fraser,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about.  Mr.\nDavid, this is Mr. Simon Fraser, whom we used to call by another title,\nbut that is an old song.  Mr. Fraser has an errand to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and made believe to\nconsult a quarto volume in the far end.\n\nI was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last person in the\nworld I had expected.  There was no doubt upon the terms of introduction;\nthis could be no other than the forfeited Master of Lovat and chief of\nthe great clan Fraser.  I knew he had led his men in the Rebellion; I\nknew his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head\u00e2\u0080\u0094my old lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, that grey fox of the mountains\u00e2\u0080\u0094to\nhave fallen on the block for that offence, the lands of the family to\nhave been seized, and their nobility attainted.  I could not conceive\nwhat he should be doing in Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house; I could not conceive that he\nhad been called to the bar, had eaten all his principles, and was now\ncurrying favour with the Government even to the extent of acting\nAdvocate-Depute in the Appin murder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is all this I hear of ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would not become me to prejudge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if the Advocate was\nyour authority he is fully possessed of my opinions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am to\nappear under Prestongrange; and from my study of the precognitions I can\nassure you your opinions are erroneous.  The guilt of Breck is manifest;\nand your testimony, in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the\nvery moment, will certify his hanging.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I observed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nfor other matters I very willingly leave you to your own impressions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Duke has been informed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have just come from his\nGrace, and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the\ngreat nobleman he is.  He spoke of you by name, Mr. Balfour, and declared\nhis gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand\nyour own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself.\nGratitude is no empty expression in that mouth: _experto-crede_.  I\ndaresay you know something of my name and clan, and the damnable example\nand lamented end of my late father, to say nothing of my own errata.\nWell, I have made my peace with that good Duke; he has intervened for me\nwith our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with my foot in the stirrup\nagain and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting\nKing George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult\nto his Majesty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoubtless a proud position for your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\nHe wagged his bald eyebrows at me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are pleased to make experiments\nin the ironical, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I am here upon duty, I am here\nto discharge my errand in good faith, it is in vain you think to divert\nme.  And let me tell you, for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like\nyourself, a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndrudgery.  The shove is now at your command; choose what you will to be\nadvanced in, the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate\ndisposition of a father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy of this country is\nto be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill-mannered colt of a\nboy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has been made a test case, all who would prosper\nin the future must put a shoulder to the wheel.  Look at me!  Do you\nsuppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly invidious\nposition of persecuting a man that I have drawn the sword alongside of?\nThe choice is not left me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with\nthat unnatural rebellion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I remarked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy case is happily otherwise; I\nam a true man, and can look either the Duke or King George in the face\nwithout concern.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it so the wind sits?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest you are fallen in the\nworst sort of error.  Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil (he tells\nme) as not to combat your allegations; but you must not think they are\nnot looked upon with strong suspicion.  You say you are innocent.  My\ndear sir, the facts declare you guilty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was waiting for you there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after the completion of the\nmurder; your long course of secresy\u00e2\u0080\u0094my good young man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Simon,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009chere is enough evidence to hang a bullock, let be a David Balfour!  I\nshall be upon that trial; my voice shall be raised; I shall then speak\nmuch otherwise from what I do to-day, and far less to your gratification,\nlittle as you like it now!  Ah, you look white!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have found\nthe key of your impudent heart.  You look pale, your eyes waver, Mr.\nDavid!  You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had\nfancied.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI own to a natural weakness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think no shame for that.\nShame. . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I was going on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShame waits for you on the gibbet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere I shall but be even\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with my lord your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha, but not so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you do not yet see to the bottom of\nthis business.  My father suffered in a great cause, and for dealing in\nthe affairs of kings.  You are to hang for a dirty murder about\nboddle-pieces.  Your personal part in it, the treacherous one of holding\nthe poor wretch in talk, your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland\ngillies.  And it can be shown, my great Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can be shown, and\nit _will_ be shown, trust _me_ that has a finger in the pie\u00e2\u0080\u0094it can be\nshown, and shall be shown, that you were paid to do it.  I think I can\nsee the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence, and it shall\nappear that you, a young man of education, let yourself be corrupted to\nthis shocking act for a suit of cast clothes, a bottle of Highland\nspirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in copper money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a\nblow: clothes, a bottle of _usquebaugh_, and\nthree-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of what\nAlan and I had carried from Auchurn; and I saw that some of James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npeople had been blabbing in their dungeons.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see I know more than you fancied,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed in triumph.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as\nfor giving it this turn, great Mr. David, you must not suppose the\nGovernment of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of\nevidence.  We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as\nwe direct them; as I direct, if you prefer the phrase.  So now you are to\nguess your part of glory if you choose to die.  On the one hand, life,\nwine, women, and a duke to be your handgun: on the other, a rope to your\ncraig, and a gibbet to clatter your bones on, and the lousiest, lowest\nstory to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told\nabout a hired assassin.  And see here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, with a formidable\nshrill voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009csee this paper that I pull out of my pocket.  Look at the\nname there: it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink scarce\ndry yet.  Can you guess its nature?  It is the warrant for your arrest,\nwhich I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the\nspot.  Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper, may God help you, for the\ndie is cast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness, and\nmuch unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger.  Mr. Simon had\nalready gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt I was now no\nruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a gentleman in this room,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI appeal to him.  I put\nmy life and credit in his hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPrestongrange shut his book with a snap.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you so, Simon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have played your hand for all it was worth, and you have lost.\nMr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you to believe it was by no choice of\nmine you were subjected to this proof.  I wish you could understand how\nglad I am you should come forth from it with so much credit.  You may not\nquite see how, but it is a little of a service to myself.  For had our\nfriend here been more successful than I was last night, it might have\nappeared that he was a better judge of men than I; it might have appeared\nwe were altogether in the wrong situations, Mr. Simon and myself.  And I\nknow our friend Simon to be ambitious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, striking lightly on\nFraser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for this stage play, it is over; my sentiments\nare very much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we can find to\nthis unfortunate affair, I shall make it my business to see it is adopted\nwith tenderness to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese were very good words, and I could see besides that there was little\nlove, and perhaps a spice of genuine ill-will, between these two who were\nopposed to me.  For all that, it was unmistakable this interview had been\ndesigned, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of both; it was plain my\nadversaries were in earnest to try me by all methods; and now\n(persuasion, flattery, and menaces having been tried in vain) I could not\nbut wonder what would be their next expedient.  My eyes besides were\nstill troubled, and my knees loose under me, with the distress of the\nlate ordeal; and I could do no more than stammer the same form of words:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI put my life and credit in your hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe must try to save them.  And in the meanwhile\nlet us return to gentler methods.  You must not bear any grudge upon my\nfriend, Mr. Simon, who did but speak by his brief.  And even if you did\nconceive some malice against myself, who stood by and seemed rather to\nhold a candle, I must not let that extend to innocent members of my\nfamily.  These are greatly engaged to see more of you, and I cannot\nconsent to have my young womenfolk disappointed.  To-morrow they will be\ngoing to Hope Park, where I think it very proper you should make your\nbow.  Call for me first, when I may possibly have something for your\nprivate hearing; then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct\nof my misses; and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had done better to have instantly refused, but in truth I was beside\nthe power of reasoning; did as I was bid; took my leave I know not how;\nand when I was forth again in the close, and the door had shut behind me,\nwas glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face.  That horrid\napparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang in my memory, as a sudden\nnoise rings after it is over in the ear.  Tales of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, of\nhis falseness, of his manifold perpetual treacheries, rose before me from\nall that I had heard and read, and joined on with what I had just\nexperienced of himself.  Each time it occurred to me, the ingenious\nfoulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my character\nstartled me afresh.  The case of the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk\nappeared scarce distinguishable from that I was now to consider as my\nown.  To rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly a\npaltry enterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as it was to be\nrepresented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared a fair second in every\npossible point of view of sordidness and cowardice.\n\nThe voices of two of Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liveried men upon his doorstep\nrecalled me to myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa\u00e2\u0080\u0099e,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the one, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis billet as fast as ye can link to the\ncaptain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that for the cateran back again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would seem sae,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the first.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHim and Simon are seeking\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Prestongrange is gane gyte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the second.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have James\nMore in bed with him next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neither your affair nor mine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the first.\n\nAnd they parted, the one upon his errand, and the other back into the\nhouse.\n\nThis looked as ill as possible.  I was scarce gone and they were sending\nalready for James More, to whom I thought Mr. Simon must have pointed\nwhen he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all\nextremities.  My scalp curdled among my hair, and the next moment the\nblood leaped in me to remember Catriona.  Poor lass! her father stood to\nbe hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct.  What was yet more\nunpalatable, it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by\nthe worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murders\u00e2\u0080\u0094murder by the\nfalse oath; and to complete our misfortunes, it seemed myself was picked\nout to be the victim.\n\nI began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only of a desire for\nmovement, air, and the open country.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\u00e2\u0080\u0094I MAKE A FAULT IN HONOUR\n\n\nI came forth, I vow I know not how, on the _Lang Dykes_ {12}.  This is a\nrural road which runs on the north side over against the city.  Thence I\ncould see the whole black length of it tail down, from where the castle\nstands upon its crags above the loch in a long line of spires and gable\nends, and smoking chimneys, and at the sight my heart swelled in my\nbosom.  My youth, as I have told, was already inured to dangers; but such\ndanger as I had seen the face of but that morning, in the midst of what\nthey call the safety of a town, shook me beyond experience.  Peril of\nslavery, peril of shipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood all of\nthese without discredit; but the peril there was in the sharp voice and\nthe fat face of Simon, properly Lord Lovat, daunted me wholly.\n\nI sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into the\nwater, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples.  If I could have\ndone so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now have fled from my\nfoolhardy enterprise.  But (call it courage or cowardice, and I believe\nit was both the one and the other) I decided I was ventured out beyond\nthe possibility of a retreat.  I had out-faced these men, I would\ncontinue to out-face them; come what might, I would stand by the word\nspoken.\n\nThe sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits, but not much.\nAt the best of it there was an icy place about my heart, and life seemed\na black business to be at all engaged in.  For two souls in particular my\npity flowed.  The one was myself, to be so friendless and lost among\ndangers.  The other was the girl, the daughter of James More.  I had seen\nbut little of her; yet my view was taken and my judgment made.  I thought\nher a lass of a clean honour, like a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; I thought her one to die of a\ndisgrace; and now I believed her father to be at that moment bargaining\nhis vile life for mine.  It made a bond in my thoughts betwixt the girl\nand me.  I had seen her before only as a wayside appearance, though one\nthat pleased me strangely; I saw her now in a sudden nearness of\nrelation, as the daughter of my blood foe, and I might say, my murderer.\nI reflected it was hard I should be so plagued and persecuted all my days\nfor other folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 affairs, and have no manner of pleasure myself.  I got\nmeals and a bed to sleep in when my concerns would suffer it; beyond that\nmy wealth was of no help to me.  If I was to hang, my days were like to\nbe short; if I was not to hang but to escape out of this trouble, they\nmight yet seem long to me ere I was done with them.  Of a sudden her face\nappeared in my memory, the way I had first seen it, with the parted lips;\nat that, weakness came in my bosom and strength into my legs; and I set\nresolutely forward on the way to Dean.  If I was to hang to-morrow, and\nit was sure enough I might very likely sleep that night in a dungeon, I\ndetermined I should hear and speak once more with Catriona.\n\nThe exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me yet\nmore, so that I began to pluck up a kind of spirit.  In the village of\nDean, where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the river, I inquired\nmy way of a miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man, who sent me up the hill upon the farther side\nby a plain path, and so to a decent-like small house in a garden of lawns\nand apple-trees.  My heart beat high as I stepped inside the garden\nhedge, but it fell low indeed when I came face to face with a grim and\nfierce old lady, walking there in a white mutch with a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat strapped\nupon the top of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do ye come seeking here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nI told her I was after Miss Drummond.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what may be your business with Miss Drummond?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\nI told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been so fortunate as to\nrender her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninvitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Saxpence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, with a very sneering manner.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA braw\ngift, a bonny gentleman.  And hae ye ony ither name and designation, or\nwere ye bapteesed Saxpence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nI told my name.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPreserve me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas Ebenezer gotten a son?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a son of Alexander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I that am the\nLaird of Shaws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI perceive you know my uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I daresay you may be the\nbetter pleased to hear that business is arranged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pursued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m come after my saxpence, mem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be thought, being my\nuncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nephew, I would be found a careful lad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed the old lady, with some\napproval.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought ye had just been a cuif\u00e2\u0080\u0094you and your saxpence, and\nyour _lucky day_ and your _sake of Balwhidder_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094from which I was\ngratified to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some of our talk.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut all this is by the purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I to understand that\nye come here keeping company?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is surely rather an early question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe maid is young,\nso am I, worse fortune.  I have but seen her the once.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not deny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\nadded, making up my mind to try her with some frankness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not deny\nbut she has run in my head a good deal since I met in with her.  That is\none thing; but it would be quite another, and I think I would look very\nlike a fool, to commit myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can speak out of your mouth, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old lady.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPraise\nGod, and so can I!  I was fool enough to take charge of this rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter: a fine charge I have gotten; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carry it\nthe way I want to.  Do ye mean to tell me, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, that you\nwould marry James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, and him hanged!  Well, then, where\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no possible marriage there shall be no manner of carryings on,\nand take that for said.  Lasses are bruckle things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, with a\nnod; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand though ye would never think it by my wrunkled chafts, I was a\nlassie mysel\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and a bonny one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLady Allardyce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor that I suppose to be your name, you seem\nto do the two sides of the talking, which is a very poor manner to come\nto an agreement.  You give me rather a home thrust when you ask if I\nwould marry, at the gallow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot, a young lady whom I have seen but\nonce.  I have told you already I would never be so untenty as to commit\nmyself.  And yet I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go some way with you.  If I continue to like the\nlass as well as I have reason to expect, it will be something more than\nher father, or the gallows either, that keeps the two of us apart.  As\nfor my family, I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee!  I owe less\nthan nothing to my uncle and if ever I marry, it will be to please one\nperson: that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Ogilvy,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much\nto be considered.  This James More is a kinsman of mine, to my shame be\nit spoken.  But the better the family, the mair men hanged or headed,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been poor Scotland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story.  And if it was just the\nhanging!  For my part I think I would be best pleased with James upon the\ngallows, which would be at least an end to him.  Catrine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good lass\nenough, and a good-hearted, and lets herself be deaved all day with a\nrunt of an auld wife like me.  But, ye see, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the weak bit.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaft about that long, false, fleeching beggar of a father of hers, and\nred-mad about the Gregara, and proscribed names, and King James, and a\nwheen blethers.  And you might think ye could guide her, ye would find\nyourself sore mista\u00e2\u0080\u0099en.  Ye say ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen her but the once. . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpoke with her but the once, I should have said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw\nher again this morning from a window at Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I was properly paid\nfor my ostentation on the return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries the old lady, with a sudden pucker of her\nface.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it was at the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door-cheek that ye met her\nfirst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told her that was so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cH\u00e2\u0080\u0099m,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; and then suddenly, upon rather a scolding tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nyour bare word for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cries, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas to who and what you are.  By your\nway of it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Balfour of the Shaws; but for what I ken you may be\nBalfour of the Deevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oxter.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible ye may come here for what\nye say, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equally possible ye may come here for deil care what!\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m good enough Whig to sit quiet, and to have keepit all my men-folk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nheads upon their shoulders.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just a good enough Whig to be\nmade a fool of neither.  And I tell you fairly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too much\nAdvocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door and Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window here for a man that comes taigling\nafter a Macgregor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter.  Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent\nye, with my fond love.  And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she,\nsuiting the action to the word; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a braw journey to ye back to where\nye cam frae.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think me a spy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I broke out, and speech stuck in my throat.  I\nstood and looked murder at the old lady for a space, then bowed and\nturned away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere!  Hoots!  The callant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a creel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink ye a spy?\nwhat else would I think ye\u00e2\u0080\u0094me that kens naething by ye?  But I see that I\nwas wrong; and as I cannot fight, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to apologise.  A bonny figure\nI would be with a broadsword.  Ay! ay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re none such a\nbad lad in your way; I think ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have some redeeming vices.  But, O!\nDavit Balfour, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re damned countryfeed.  Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to win over that,\nlad; ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to soople your back-bone, and think a wee pickle less of\nyour dainty self; and ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to try to find out that women-folk are\nnae grenadiers.  But that can never be.  To your last day you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ken no\nmore of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had never been used with such expressions from a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue, the\nonly two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being most\ndevout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement must have\nbeen depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst forth suddenly in\na fit of laughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, struggling with her mirth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have the finest\ntimber face\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland cateran!  Davie,\nmy dear, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to make a match of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it was just to see\nthe weans.  And now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no manner of service in your\ndaidling here, for the young woman is from home, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my fear that\nthe old woman is no suitable companion for your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.  Forbye\nthat I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation, and have been\nlong enough alone with a sedooctive youth.  And come back another day for\nyour saxpence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried after me as I left.\n\nMy skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a boldness they\nhad otherwise wanted.  For two days the image of Catriona had mixed in\nall my meditations; she made their background, so that I scarce enjoyed\nmy own company without a glint of her in a corner of my mind.  But now\nshe came immediately near; I seemed to touch her, whom I had never\ntouched but the once; I let myself flow out to her in a happy weakness,\nand looking all about, and before and behind, saw the world like an\nundesirable desert, where men go as soldiers on a march, following their\nduty with what constancy they have, and Catriona alone there to offer me\nsome pleasure of my days.  I wondered at myself that I could dwell on\nsuch considerations in that time of my peril and disgrace; and when I\nremembered my youth I was ashamed.  I had my studies to complete: I had\nto be called into some useful business; I had yet to take my part of\nservice in a place where all must serve; I had yet to learn, and know,\nand prove myself a man; and I had so much sense as blush that I should be\nalready tempted with these further-on and holier delights and duties.  My\neducation spoke home to me sharply; I was never brought up on sugar\nbiscuits but on the hard food of the truth.  I knew that he was quite\nunfit to be a husband who was not prepared to be a father also; and for a\nboy like me to play the father was a mere derision.\n\nWhen I was in the midst of these thoughts and about half-way back to town\nI saw a figure coming to meet me, and the trouble of my heart was\nheightened.  It seemed I had everything in the world to say to her, but\nnothing to say first; and remembering how tongue-tied I had been that\nmorning at the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I made sure that I would find myself struck\ndumb.  But when she came up my fears fled away; not even the\nconsciousness of what I had been privately thinking disconcerted me the\nleast; and I found I could talk with her as easily and rationally as I\nmight with Alan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have been seeking your sixpence; did you get it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told her no; but now I had met with her my walk was not in vain.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I have seen you to-day already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, and told her where and\nwhen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not see you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy eyes are big, but there are better\nthan mine at seeing far.  Only I heard singing in the house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was Miss Grant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe eldest and the bonniest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say they are all beautiful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think the same of you, Miss Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand were all\ncrowding to the window to observe you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a pity about my being so blind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor I might have seen\nthem too.  And you were in the house?  You must have been having the fine\ntime with the fine music and the pretty ladies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is just where you are wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I was as uncouth as a\nsea-fish upon the brae of a mountain.  The truth is that I am better\nfitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I would think so too, at all events!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, at which we both\nof us laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a strange thing, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not the least afraid with\nyou, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants.  And I was afraid of your\ncousin too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, I think any man will be afraid of her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father is\nafraid of her himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe name of her father brought me to a stop.  I looked at her as she\nwalked by my side; I recalled the man, and the little I knew and the much\nI guessed of him; and comparing the one with the other, felt like a\ntraitor to be silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeaking of which,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI met your father no later than this\nmorning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, with a voice of joy that seemed to mock at me.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw James More?  You will have spoken with him then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did even that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nThen I think things went the worst way for me that was humanly possible.\nShe gave me a look of mere gratitude.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, thank you for that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nshe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou thank me for very little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, and then stopped.  But it seemed\nwhen I was holding back so much, something at least had to come out.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nspoke rather ill to him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did no like him very much; I spoke\nhim rather ill, and he was angry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to his daughter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe cried out.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut those that do not love and cherish him I will not\nknow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take the freedom of a word yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, beginning to tremble.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps neither your father nor I are in the best of spirits at\nPrestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  I daresay we both have anxious business there, for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\na dangerous house.  I was sorry for him too, and spoke to him the first,\nif I could but have spoken the wiser.  And for one thing, in my opinion,\nyou will soon find that his affairs are mending.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nhe is much made up to you for your sorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am alone in this world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am not wondering at that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, let me speak!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will speak but the once, and then leave\nyou, if you will, for ever.  I came this day in the hopes of a kind word\nthat I am sore in want of.  I know that what I said must hurt you, and I\nknew it then.  It would have been easy to have spoken smooth, easy to lie\nto you; can you not think how I was tempted to the same?  Cannot you see\nthe truth of my heart shine out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think\nwe will have met but the once, and will can part like gentle folk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, let me have one to believe in me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pleaded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannae bear it else.\nThe whole world is clanned against me.  How am I to go through with my\ndreadful fate?  If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be none to believe in me I cannot do it.\nThe man must just die, for I cannot do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had still looked straight in front of her, head in air; but at my\nwords or the tone of my voice she came to a stop.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is this you\nsay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you talking of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my testimony which may save an innocent life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they\nwill not suffer me to bear it.  What would you do yourself?  You know\nwhat this is, whose father lies in danger.  Would you desert the poor\nsoul?  They have tried all ways with me.  They have sought to bribe me;\nthey offered me hills and valleys.  And to-day that sleuth-hound told me\nhow I stood, and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace me.\nI am to be brought in a party to the murder; I am to have held Glenure in\ntalk for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and shamed.  If this is\nthe way I am to fall, and me scarce a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094if this is the story to be told\nof me in all Scotland\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you are to believe it too, and my name is to be\nnothing but a by-word\u00e2\u0080\u0094Catriona, how can I go through with it?  The\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not possible; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more than a man has in his heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other; and when I stopped\nI found her gazing on me with a startled face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlenure!  It is the Appin murder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said softly, but with a very deep\nsurprise.\n\nI had turned back to bear her company, and we were now come near the head\nof the brae above Dean village.  At this word I stepped in front of her\nlike one suddenly distracted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, what is this that I have\ndone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and carried my fists to my temples.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat made me do it?  Sure, I\nam bewitched to say these things!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the name of heaven, what ails you now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave my honour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I groaned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave my honour and now I have broke it.\nO, Catriona!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am asking you what it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas it these things you should\nnot have spoken?  And do you think I have no honour, then? or that I am\none that would betray a friend?  I hold up my right hand to you and\nswear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, I knew you would be true!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here.  I that stood\nbut this morning and out-faced them, that risked rather to die disgraced\nupon the gallows than do wrong\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a few hours after I throw my honour\naway by the roadside in common talk!  \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is one thing clear upon our\ninterview,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that I can rely on your pledged word.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Where is my\nword now?  Who could believe me now?  You could not believe me.  I am\nclean fallen down; I had best die!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  All this I said with a weeping\nvoice, but I had no tears in my body.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy heart is sore for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut be sure you are too nice.  I\nwould not believe you, do you say?  I would trust you with anything.  And\nthese men?  I would not be thinking of them!  Men who go about to entrap\nand to destroy you!  Fy! this is no time to crouch.  Look up!  Do you not\nthink I will be admiring you like a great hero of the good\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you a boy\nnot much older than myself?  And because you said a word too much in a\nfriend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, that would die ere she betrayed you\u00e2\u0080\u0094to make such a matter!\nIt is one thing that we must both forget.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, looking at her, hang-dog, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this true of it?  Would\nye trust me yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you not believe the tears upon my face?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the\nworld I am thinking of you, Mr. David Balfour.  Let them hang you; I will\nnever forget, I will grow old and still remember you.  I think it is\ngreat to die so: I will envy you that gallows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe they but make a mock of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is what I must know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must hear the whole.  The harm is\ndone at all events, and I must hear the whole.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place beside me, and I\ntold her all that matter much as I have written it, my thoughts about her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealings being alone omitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, when I had finished, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are a hero, surely, and I\nnever would have thought that same!  And I think you are in peril, too.\nO, Simon Fraser! to think upon that man!  For his life and the dirty\nmoney, to be dealing in such traffic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And just then she called out\naloud with a queer word that was common with her, and belongs, I believe,\nto her own language.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy torture!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at the sun!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains.\n\nShe bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left me in a turmoil of\nglad spirits.  I delayed to go home to my lodging, for I had a terror of\nimmediate arrest; but got some supper at a change house, and the better\npart of that night walked by myself in the barley-fields, and had such a\nsense of Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence that I seemed to bear her in my arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE BRAVO\n\n\nThe next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a\ncoat that I had made to my own measure, and was but newly ready.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAha,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Prestongrange, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are very fine to-day; my misses are to\nhave a fine cavalier.  Come, I take that kind of you.  I take that kind\nof you, Mr. David.  O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your\ntroubles are nearly at an end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have news for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeyond anticipation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour testimony is after all to be\nreceived; and you may go, if you will, in my company to the trial, which\nin to be held at Inverary, Thursday, 21st _proximo_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was too much amazed to find words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the meanwhile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I will not ask you to renew\nyour pledge, I must caution you strictly to be reticent.  To-morrow your\nprecognition must be taken; and outside of that, do you know, I think\nleast said will be soonest mended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall try to go discreetly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe it is yourself that I\nmust thank for this crowning mercy, and I do thank you gratefully.  After\nyesterday, my lord, this is like the doors of Heaven.  I cannot find it\nin my heart to get the thing believed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but you must try and manage, you must try and manage to believe it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, soothing-like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am very glad to hear your acknowledgment\nof obligation, for I think you may be able to repay me very shortly\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\ncoughed\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cor even now.  The matter is much changed.  Your testimony, which\nI shall not trouble you for to-day, will doubtless alter the complexion\nof the case for all concerned, and this makes it less delicate for me to\nenter with you on a side issue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcuse me for interrupting you, but how has\nthis been brought about?  The obstacles you told me of on Saturday\nappeared even to me to be quite insurmountable; how has it been\ncontrived?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would never do for me to divulge (even\nto you, as you say) the councils of the Government; and you must content\nyourself, if you please, with the gross fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing the while with a new\npen; methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of deception\nin the man: yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper, dipped his pen\namong the ink, and began again to address me, I was somehow not so\ncertain, and fell instinctively into an attitude of guard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a point I wish to touch upon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI purposely left it\nbefore upon one side, which need be now no longer necessary.  This is\nnot, of course, a part of your examination, which is to follow by another\nhand; this is a private interest of my own.  You say you encountered Alan\nBreck upon the hill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was immediately after the murder?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you speak to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had known him before, I think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says my lord, carelessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot guess your reason for so thinking, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nsuch in the fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when did you part with him again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI reserve my answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question will be put to me at the\nassize.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you not understand that all this is without\nprejudice to yourself?  I have promised you life and honour; and, believe\nme, I can keep my word.  You are therefore clear of all anxiety.  Alan,\nit appears, you suppose you can protect; and you talk to me of your\ngratitude, which I think (if you push me) is not ill-deserved.  There are\na great many different considerations all pointing the same way; and I\nwill never be persuaded that you could not help us (if you chose) to put\nsalt on Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI give you my word I do not so much as guess where\nAlan is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused a breath.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNor how he might be found?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nI sat before him like a log of wood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he observed.  Again there\nwas a piece of silence.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, rising, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not fortunate,\nand we are a couple at cross purposes.  Let us speak of it no more; you\nwill receive notice when, where, and by whom, we are to take your\nprecognition.  And in the meantime, my misses must be waiting you.  They\nwill never forgive me if I detain their cavalier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nInto the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered up, and found\nthem dressed beyond what I had thought possible, and looking fair as a\nposy.\n\nAs we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which came\nafterwards to look extremely big.  I heard a whistle sound loud and brief\nlike a signal, and looking all about, spied for one moment the red head\nof Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan.  The next moment he was gone\nagain, nor could I see so much as the skirt-tail of Catriona, upon whom I\nnaturally supposed him to be then attending.\n\nMy three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield Links; whence a\npath carried us to Hope Park, a beautiful pleasance, laid with\ngravel-walks, furnished with seats and summer-sheds, and warded by a\nkeeper.  The way there was a little longsome; the two younger misses\naffected an air of genteel weariness that damped me cruelly, the eldest\nconsidered me with something that at times appeared like mirth; and\nthough I thought I did myself more justice than the day before, it was\nnot without some effort.  Upon our reaching the park I was launched on a\nbevy of eight or ten young gentlemen (some of them cockaded officers, the\nrest chiefly advocates) who crowded to attend upon these beauties; and\nthough I was presented to all of them in very good words, it seemed I was\nby all immediately forgotten.  Young folk in a company are like to savage\nanimals: they fall upon or scorn a stranger without civility, or I may\nsay, humanity; and I am sure, if I had been among baboons, they would\nhave shown me quite as much of both.  Some of the advocates set up to be\nwits, and some of the soldiers to be rattles; and I could not tell which\nof these extremes annoyed me most.  All had a manner of handling their\nswords and coat-skirts, for the which (in mere black envy) I could have\nkicked them from the park.  I daresay, upon their side, they grudged me\nextremely the fine company in which I had arrived; and altogether I had\nsoon fallen behind, and stepped stiffly in the rear of all that merriment\nwith my own thoughts.\n\nFrom these I was recalled by one of the officers, Lieutenant Hector\nDuncansby, a gawky, leering Highland boy, asking if my name was not\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPalfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was scant civil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa, Palfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, and then, repeating it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPalfour, Palfour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid you do not like my name, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, annoyed with myself\nto be annoyed with such a rustical fellow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I wass thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not advise you to make a practice of that, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nfeel sure you would not find it to agree with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nI asked him what he could possibly mean, and he answered, with a heckling\nlaugh, that he thought I must have found the poker in the same place and\nswallowed it.\n\nThere could be no mistake about this, and my cheek burned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\nwould learn the English language first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly outside\nHope Park.  But no sooner were we beyond the view of the promenaders,\nthan the fashion of his countenance changed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou tam lowland\nscoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099rel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his closed\nfist.\n\nI paid him as good or better on the return; whereupon he stepped a little\nback and took off his hat to me decorously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough plows I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be the offended shentleman, for\nwho effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is the\nking\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officer he cannae speak Cot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s English?  We have swords at our\nhurdles, and here is the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park at hand.  Will ye walk first, or let\nme show ye the way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed him.  As he went I\nheard him grumble to himself about _Cot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s English_ and the _King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat_,\nso that I might have supposed him to be seriously offended.  But his\nmanner at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him.  It was\nmanifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel on me, right or wrong;\nmanifest that I was taken in a fresh contrivance of my enemies; and to me\n(conscious as I was of my deficiencies) manifest enough that I should be\nthe one to fall in our encounter.\n\nAs we came into that rough rocky desert of the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park I was tempted\nhalf-a-dozen times to take to my heels and run for it, so loath was I to\nshow my ignorance in fencing, and so much averse to die or even to be\nwounded.  But I considered if their malice went as far as this, it would\nlikely stick at nothing; and that to fall by the sword, however\nungracefully, was still an improvement on the gallows.  I considered\nbesides that by the unguarded pertness of my words and the quickness of\nmy blow I had put myself quite out of court; and that even if I ran, my\nadversary would probably pursue and catch me, which would add disgrace to\nmy misfortune.  So that, taking all in all, I continued marching behind\nhim, much as a man follows the hangman, and certainly with no more hope.\n\nWe went about the end of the long craigs, and came into the Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bog.\nHere, on a piece of fair turf, my adversary drew.  There was nobody there\nto see us but some birds; and no resource for me but to follow his\nexample, and stand on guard with the best face I could display.  It seems\nit was not good enough for Mr. Dancansby, who spied some flaw in my\nman\u00c5\u0093uvres, paused, looked upon me sharply, and came off and on, and\nmenaced me with his blade in the air.  As I had seen no such proceedings\nfrom Alan, and was besides a good deal affected with the proximity of\ndeath, I grew quite bewildered, stood helpless, and could have longed to\nrun away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFat deil ails her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries the lieutenant.\n\nAnd suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out of my grasp and sent it\nflying far among the rushes.\n\nTwice was this man\u00c5\u0093uvre repeated; and the third time when I brought back\nmy humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own to the scabbard,\nand stood awaiting me with a face of some anger, and his hands clasped\nunder his skirt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPe tamned if I touch you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, and asked me bitterly what right I\nhad to stand up before \u00e2\u0080\u009cshentlemans\u00e2\u0080\u009d when I did not know the back of a\nsword from the front of it.\n\nI answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and would he do me the\njustice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was unfortunately\nin my power to offer, and had stood up like a man?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am fery prave myself, and pold as a\nlions.  But to stand up there\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you ken naething of fence!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the way that\nyou did, I declare it was peyond me.  And I am sorry for the plow; though\nI declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and my heid still\nsings with it.  And I declare if I had kent what way it wass, I would not\nput a hand to such a piece of pusiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is handsomely said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am sure you will not stand\nup a second time to be the actor for my private enemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, no, Palfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think I was used extremely\nsuffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife, or all the\nsame as a bairn whateffer!  And I will tell the Master so, and fecht him,\nby Cot, himself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarrel with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nwould be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats were made of the\nsame meal and the devil was the miller that ground that; then suddenly\nshaking me by the hand, he vowed I was a pretty enough fellow after all,\nthat it was a thousand pities I had been neglected, and that if he could\nfind the time, he would give an eye himself to have me educated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can do me a better service than even what you propose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; and\nwhen he had asked its nature\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome with me to the house of one of my\nenemies, and testify how I have carried myself this day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I told him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will be the true service.  For though he has sent me a gallant\nadversary for the first, the thought in Mr. Simon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind is merely\nmurder.  There will be a second and then a third; and by what you have\nseen of my cleverness with the cold steel, you can judge for yourself\nwhat is like to be the upshot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I would not like it myself, if I was no more of a man than what you\nwass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will do you right, Palfour.  Lead on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIf I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels were\nlight enough on the way out.  They kept time to a very good old air, that\nis as ancient as the Bible, and the words of it are: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Surely the\nbitterness of death is passed_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I mind that I was extremely thirsty,\nand had a drink at Saint Margaret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well on the road down, and the\nsweetness of that water passed belief.  We went through the sanctuary, up\nthe Canongate, in by the Netherbow, and straight to Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door,\ntalking as we came and arranging the details of our affair.  The footman\nowned his master was at home, but declared him engaged with other\ngentlemen on very private business, and his door forbidden.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy business is but for three minutes, and it cannot wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nmay say it is by no means private, and I shall be even glad to have some\nwitnesses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand, we made so bold\nas to follow him to the ante-chamber, whence I could hear for a while the\nmurmuring of several voices in the room within.  The truth is, they were\nthree at the one table\u00e2\u0080\u0094Prestongrange, Simon Fraser, and Mr. Erskine,\nSheriff of Perth; and as they were met in consultation on the very\nbusiness of the Appin murder, they were a little disturbed at my\nappearance, but decided to receive me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here again? and who is this\nyou bring with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Prestongrange.\n\nAs for Fraser, he looked before him on the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is here to bear a little testimony in my favour, my lord, which I\nthink it very needful you should hear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, and turned to Duncansby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have only to say this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lieutenant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I stood up this day\nwith Palfour in the Hunter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pog, which I am now fery sorry for, and he\nbehaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it.  And I have\ncreat respects for Palfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for your honest expressions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nWhereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company, and left the chamber, as\nwe had agreed upon before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have I to do with this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Prestongrange.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell your lordship in two words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have brought this\ngentleman, a King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officer, to do me so much justice.  Now I think my\ncharacter is covered, and until a certain date, which your lordship can\nvery well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any\nmore officers.  I will not consent to fight my way through the garrison\nof the castle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe veins swelled on Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brow, and he regarded me with fury.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncried; and then, turning fiercely on his neighbour, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is some of your\nwork, Simon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spy your hand in the business, and, let me\ntell you, I resent it.  It is disloyal, when we are agreed upon one\nexpedient, to follow another in the dark.  You are disloyal to me.  What!\nyou let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters!  And\nbecause I let drop a word to you..... Fy, sir, keep your dishonours to\nyourself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSimon was deadly pale.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be a kick-ball between you and the Duke\nno longer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither come to an agreement, or come to a\ndiffer, and have it out among yourselves.  But I will no longer fetch and\ncarry, and get your contrary instructions, and be blamed by both.  For if\nI were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover business it would\nmake your head sing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and now intervened\nsmoothly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd in the meantime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we should tell Mr.\nBalfour that his character for valour is quite established.  He may sleep\nin peace.  Until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall be put\nto the proof no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis coolness brought the others to their prudence; and they made haste,\nwith a somewhat distracted civility, to pack me from the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE HEATHER ON FIRE\n\n\nWhen I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first time angry.\nThe Advocate had made a mock of me.  He had pretended my testimony was to\nbe received and myself respected; and in that very hour, not only was\nSimon practising against my life by the hands of the Highland soldier,\nbut (as appeared from his own language) Prestongrange himself had some\ndesign in operation.  I counted my enemies; Prestongrange with all the\nKing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority behind him; and the Duke with the power of the West\nHighlands; and the Lovat interest by their side to help them with so\ngreat a force in the north, and the whole clan of old Jacobite spies and\ntraffickers.  And when I remembered James More, and the red head of Neil\nthe son of Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the\nconfederacy, and what remained of Rob Roy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old desperate sept of\ncaterans would be banded against me with the others.  One thing was\nrequisite\u00e2\u0080\u0094some strong friend or wise adviser.  The country must be full\nof such, both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and the Duke and\nPrestongrange had not been nosing for expedients; and it made me rage to\nthink that I might brush against my champions in the street and be no\nwiser.\n\nAnd just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me going by,\ngave me a meaning look, and turned into a close.  I knew him with the\ntail of my eye\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing my good fortune,\nturned in to follow him.  As soon as I had entered the close I saw him\nstanding in the mouth of a stair, where he made me a signal and\nimmediately vanished.  Seven storeys up, there he was again in a house\ndoor, the which he looked behind us after we had entered.  The house was\nquite dismantled, with not a stick of furniture; indeed, it was one of\nwhich Stewart had the letting in his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to sit upon the floor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe here for the\ntime being, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wearying to see ye, Mr. Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it with Alan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrawly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAndie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow,\nWednesday.  He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that things\nwere going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart.  And that\nbrings me to the essential: how does your business speed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was told only this morning that my testimony was\naccepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate, no less.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHout awa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never believe that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have maybe a suspicion of my own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I would like fine to\nhear your reasons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I tell ye fairly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m horn-mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my one hand\ncould pull their Government down I would pluck it like a rotten apple.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens; and, of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\nduty to defend my kinsman for his life.  Hear how it goes with me, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave the judgment of it to yourself.  The first thing they have to\ndo is to get rid of Alan.  They cannae bring in James as art and part\nuntil they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve brought in Alan first as principal; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sound law: they\ncould never put the cart before the horse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSound law,\ntoo.  It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-doer another\nwas to go scatheless, and the remeid is to summon the principal and put\nhim to outlawry for the non-compearance.  Now there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four places where a\nperson can be summoned: at his dwelling-house; at a place where he has\nresided forty days; at the head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily\nresorts; or lastly (if there be ground to think him forth of Scotland)\n_at the cross of Edinburgh_, _and the pier and shore of Leith_, _for\nsixty days_.  The purpose of which last provision is evident upon its\nface: being that outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the\ntransaction, and the summonsing be something other than a form.  Now take\nthe case of Alan.  He has no dwelling-house that ever I could hear of; I\nwould be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty days\ntogether since the \u00e2\u0080\u009945; there is no shire where he resorts whether\nordinarily or extraordinarily; if he has a domicile at all, which I\nmisdoubt, it must be with his regiment in France; and if he is not yet\nforth of Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen to guess) it must\nbe evident to the most dull it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aiming for.  Where, then, and\nwhat way should he be summoned?  I ask it at yourself, a layman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have given the very words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere at the cross, and at the\npier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries the\nWriter.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-fifth,\nthe day that we first met.  Once, and done with it.  And where?  Where,\nbut at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the Campbells?  A word in\nyour ear, Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeking Alan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot seeking him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the best that I can make of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot wanting to find him,\nin my poor thought.  They think perhaps he might set up a fair defence,\nupon the back of which James, the man they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really after, might climb\nout.  This is not a case, ye see, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conspiracy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthough, when I come to think of it, he was something of the easiest put\nby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there!  I may be right or wrong, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nguesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again.  It comes to my\nears that James and the witnesses\u00e2\u0080\u0094the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!\u00e2\u0080\u0094lay in\nclose dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison at Fort\nWilliam; none allowed in to them, nor they to write.  The witnesses, Mr.\nBalfour; heard ye ever the match of that?  I assure ye, no old, crooked\nStewart of the gang ever out-faced the law more impudently.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clean\nin the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous\nimprisonment.  No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord\nJustice Clerk.  I have his word to-day.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law for ye! here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\njustice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced paper\nthat was printed since in the pamphlet \u00e2\u0080\u009cby a bystander,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for behoof (as\nthe title says) of James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor widow and five children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart, \u00e2\u0080\u009che couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare to refuse me access to my client,\nso he _recommends the commanding officer to let me in_.  Recommends!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nLord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends.  Is not the purpose of such\nlanguage plain?  They hope the officer may be so dull, or so very much\nthe reverse, as to refuse the recommendation.  I would have to make the\njourney back again betwixt here and Fort William.  Then would follow a\nfresh delay till I got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the\nofficer\u00e2\u0080\u0094military man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0094I ken the\ncant of it.  Then the journey a third time; and there we should be on the\nimmediate heels of the trial before I had received my first instruction.\nAm I not right to call this a conspiracy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will bear that colour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go on to prove it you outright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have the right\nto hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to visit him.  They have\nno right to hold the witnesses; but am I to get a sight of them, that\nshould be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk himself!  See\u00e2\u0080\u0094read: _For the\nrest_, _refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not\naccused as having done anything contrary to the duties of their office_.\nAnything contrary!  Sirs!  And the Act of seventeen hunner?  Mr. Balfour,\nthis makes my heart to burst; the heather is on fire inside my wame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the plain English of that phrase,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that the witnesses\nare still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I am not to see them until Inverary, when the court is set!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand then to hear Prestongrange upon _the anxious responsibilities of\nhis office and the great facilities afforded the defence_!  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbegowk them there, Mr. David.  I have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon\nthe road, and see if I cannae get I a little harle of justice out of the\n_military man notoriously ignorant of the law_ that shall command the\nparty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was actually so\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum, and by\nthe connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first saw the\nwitnesses upon the case.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing that would surprise me in this business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I remarked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll surprise you ere I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo ye see this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094producing\na print still wet from the press.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the libel: see, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPrestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name to the list of witnesses, and I find no word of any\nBalfour.  But here is not the question.  Who do ye think paid for the\nprinting of this paper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose it would likely be King George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it happens it was me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot but it was printed by and for\nthemselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon thief of the black\nmidnight, Simon Fraser.  But could _I_ win to get a copy!  No!  I was to\ngo blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the charges for the first time\nin court alongst the jury.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not this against the law?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot say so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a favour so natural and so\nconstantly rendered (till this nonesuch business) that the law has never\nlooked to it.  And now admire the hand of Providence!  A stranger is in\nFleming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s printing house, spies a proof on the floor, picks it up, and\ncarries it to me.  Of all things, it was just this libel.  Whereupon I\nhad it set again\u00e2\u0080\u0094printed at the expense of the defence: _sumptibus moesti\nrei_; heard ever man the like of it?\u00e2\u0080\u0094and here it is for anybody, the\nmuckle secret out\u00e2\u0080\u0094all may see it now.  But how do you think I would enjoy\nthis, that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, I think you would enjoy it ill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now you see how it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand why, when you tell me\nyour evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was now my turn.  I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threats and\noffers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the subsequent scene at\nPrestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Of my first talk, according to promise, I said nothing,\nnor indeed was it necessary.  All the time I was talking Stewart nodded\nhis head like a mechanical figure; and no sooner had my voice ceased,\nthan he opened his mouth and gave me his opinion in two words, dwelling\nstrong on both of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisappear yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not take you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carry you there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy my view of it you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re to\ndisappear whatever.  O, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outside debate.  The Advocate, who is not\nwithout some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung your life-safe out\nof Simon and the Duke.  He has refused to put you on your trial, and\nrefused to have you killed; and there is the clue to their ill words\ntogether, for Simon and the Duke can keep faith with neither friend nor\nenemy.  Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not to be tried then, and ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not to be murdered; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nin bitter error if ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the\nLady Grange.  Bet me what ye please\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was their _expedient_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou make me think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, and told him of the whistle and the\nred-headed retainer, Neil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWherever James More is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one big rogue, never be deceived on\nthat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHis father was none so ill a man, though a kenning on\nthe wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family, that I should\nwaste my breath to be defending him!  But as for James he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brock and a\nblagyard.  I like the appearance of this red-headed Neil as little as\nyourself.  It looks uncanny: fiegh! it smells bad.  It was old Lovat that\nmanaged the Lady Grange affair; if young Lovat is to handle yours, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe all in the family.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s James More in prison for?  The same\noffence: abduction.  His men have had practice in the business.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nto lend them to be Simon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instruments; and the next thing we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nhearing, James will have made his peace, or else he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have escaped; and\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in Benbecula or Applecross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe make a strong case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I admitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what I want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that you should disappear yourself ere\nthey can get their hands upon ye.  Lie quiet until just before the trial,\nand spring upon them at the last of it when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be looking for you\nleast.  This is always supposing Mr. Balfour, that your evidence is worth\nso very great a measure of both risk and fash.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you one thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw the murderer and it was not\nAlan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, by God, my cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saved!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Stewart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have his life\nupon your tongue; and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neither time, risk, nor money to be spared\nto bring you to the trial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He emptied his pockets on the floor.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\nis all that I have by me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake it, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want it ere ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nthrough.  Go straight down this close, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a way out by there to the\nLang Dykes, and by my will of it! see no more of Edinburgh till the clash\nis over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere am I to go, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I wish that I could tell ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut all the places that I\ncould send ye to, would be just the places they would seek.  No, ye must\nfend for yourself, and God be your guiding!  Five days before the trial,\nSeptember the sixteen, get word to me at the _King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arms_ in Stirling;\nand if ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed for yourself as long as that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that ye reach\nInverary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I no see Alan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed boggled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHech, I would rather you wouldnae,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\ncan never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and is to lie this\nnight by Silvermills on purpose.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sure that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not\nfollowed, Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0094but make sure of that\u00e2\u0080\u0094lie in a good place and watch\nyour road for a clear hour before ye risk it.  It would be a dreadful\nbusiness if both you and him was to miscarry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE RED-HEADED MAN\n\n\nIt was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang Dykes.  Dean\nwas where I wanted to go.  Since Catriona dwelled there, and her kinsfolk\nthe Glengyle Macgregors appeared almost certainly to be employed against\nme, it was just one of the few places I should have kept away from; and\nbeing a very young man, and beginning to be very much in love, I turned\nmy face in that direction without pause.  As a slave to my conscience and\ncommon sense, however, I took a measure of precaution.  Coming over the\ncrown of a bit of a rise in the road, I clapped down suddenly among the\nbarley and lay waiting.  After a while, a man went by that looked to be a\nHighlandman, but I had never seen him till that hour.  Presently after\ncame Neil of the red head.  The next to go past was a miller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cart, and\nafter that nothing but manifest country people.  Here was enough to have\nturned the most foolhardy from his purpose, but my inclination ran too\nstrong the other way.  I argued it out that if Neil was on that road, it\nwas the right road to find him in, leading direct to his chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndaughter; as for the other Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by\nevery Highlandman I saw, I would scarce reach anywhere.  And having quite\nsatisfied myself with this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed\nof it, and came a little after four to Mrs. Drumond-Ogilvy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nBoth ladies were within the house; and upon my perceiving them together\nby the open door, I plucked off my hat and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere was a lad come\nseeking saxpence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which I thought might please the dowager.\n\nCatriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise, the old lady\nseemed scarce less forward than herself.  I learned long afterwards that\nshe had despatched a horseman by daylight to Rankeillor at the\nQueensferry, whom she knew to be the doer for Shaws, and had then in her\npocket a letter from that good friend of mine, presenting, in the most\nfavourable view, my character and prospects.  But had I read it I could\nscarce have seen more clear in her designs.  Maybe I was _countryfeed_;\nat least, I was not so much so as she thought; and it was even to my\nhomespun wits, that she was bent to hammer up a match between her cousin\nand a beardless boy that was something of a laird in Lothian.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSaxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun\nand tell the lasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains to\nflatter me; always cleverly, always with the appearance of a banter,\nstill calling me Saxpence, but with such a turn that should rather uplift\nme in my own opinion.  When Catriona returned, the design became if\npossible more obvious; and she showed off the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantages like a\nhorse-couper with a horse.  My face flamed that she should think me so\nobtuse.  Now I would fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of,\nand then I could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel; and now,\nthat perhaps these two had set their heads together to entrap me, and at\nthat I sat and gloomed betwixt them like the very image of ill-will.  At\nlast the matchmaker had a better device, which was to leave the pair of\nus alone.  When my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a little\nthe wrong side of easy to allay them.  But though I knew what breed she\nwas of, and that was a breed of thieves, I could never look in Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface and disbelieve her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not ask?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, eagerly, the same moment we were left alone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nlightened of my pledge, and indeed (after what has come and gone since\nmorning) I would not have renewed it were it asked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy cousin will not be so long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the last\nof it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there was matter of\nmirth in that absurdity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the\npretty ladies, after all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, when I had done.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what was your\nfather that he could not learn you to draw the sword!  It is most\nungentle; I have not heard the match of that in anyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is most misconvenient at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think my father\n(honest man!) must have been wool-gathering to learn me Latin in the\nplace of it.  But you see I do the best I can, and just stand up like\nLot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife and let them hammer at me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know what makes me smile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is this.  I am\nmade this way, that I should have been a man child.  In my own thoughts\nit is so I am always; and I go on telling myself about this thing that is\nto befall and that.  Then it comes to the place of the fighting, and it\ncomes over me that I am only a girl at all events, and cannot hold a\nsword or give one good blow; and then I have to twist my story round\nabout, so that the fighting is to stop, and yet me have the best of it,\njust like you and the lieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine\nspeeches all through, like Mr. David Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a bloodthirsty maid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make samplers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut if you were to do nothing else in the great world, I think you\nwill say yourself it is a driech business; and it is not that I want to\nkill, I think.  Did ever you kill anyone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I have, as it chances.  Two, no less, and me still a lad that\nshould be at the college,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut yet, in the look-back, I take no\nshame for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how did you feel, then\u00e2\u0080\u0094after it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u009dDeed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel where these tears should come\nfrom.  And at any rate, I would not wish to kill, only to be Catherine\nDouglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt, where it was\nbroken.  That is my chief hero.  Would you not love to die so\u00e2\u0080\u0094for your\nking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy affection for my king, God bless the puggy face of\nhim, is under more control; and I thought I saw death so near to me this\nday already, that I am rather taken up with the notion of living.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe right mind of a man!  Only you must learn arms; I\nwould not like to have a friend that cannot strike.  But it will not have\nbeen with the sword that you killed these two?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut with a pair of pistols.  And a fortunate thing\nit was the men were so near-hand to me, for I am about as clever with the\npistols as I am with the sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig, which I had\nomitted in my first account of my affairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are brave.  And your friend, I admire and love\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I think anyone would!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has his faults like other\nfolk; but he is brave and staunch and kind, God bless him!  That will be\na strange day when I forget Alan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And the thought of him, and that it\nwas within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost overcome\nme.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where will my head be gone that I have not told my news!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried,\nand spoke of a letter from her father, bearing that she might visit him\nto-morrow in the castle whither he was now transferred, and that his\naffairs were mending.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not like to hear it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you\njudge my father and not know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a thousand miles from judging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I give you my word\nI do rejoice to know your heart is lightened.  If my face fell at all, as\nI suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an ill day for\ncompositions, and the people in power extremely ill persons to be\ncompounding with.  I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on my stomach\nstill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will not be evening these two; and you should bear\nin mind that Prestongrange and James More, my father, are of the one\nblood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never heard tell of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is rather singular how little you are acquainted with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne part may call themselves Grant, and one Macgregor, but they are\nstill of the same clan.  They are all the sons of Alpin, from whom, I\nthink, our country has its name.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat country is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy country and yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is my day for discovering I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I always thought\nthe name of it was Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cScotland is the name of what you call Ireland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the\nold ancient true name of this place that we have our foot-soles on, and\nthat our bones are made of, will be Alban.  It was Alban they called it\nwhen our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and Alexander;\nand it is called so still in your own tongue that you forget.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that I never learned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  For I lacked heart to take\nher up about the Macedonian.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation with another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it was sung about the cradles before you or me were ever\ndreamed of; and your name remembers it still.  Ah, if you could talk that\nlanguage you would find me another girl.  The heart speaks in that\ntongue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had a meal with the two ladies, all very good, served in fine old\nplate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that Mrs. Ogilvy was rich.\nOur talk, too, was pleasant enough; but as soon as I saw the sun decline\nsharply and the shadows to run out long, I rose to take my leave.  For my\nmind was now made up to say farewell to Alan; and it was needful I should\nsee the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it, by daylight.  Catriona came\nwith me as far as to the garden gate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is long till I see you now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is beyond my judging,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be long, it may be\nnever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you are sorry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI bowed my head, looking upon her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo am I, at all events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen you but a small time,\nbut I put you very high.  You are true, you are brave; in time I think\nyou will be more of a man yet.  I will be proud to hear of that.  If you\nshould speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0094O well!\nthink you have the one friend.  Long after you are dead and me an old\nwife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears\nrunning.  I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and\ndid to you.  _God go with you and guide you_, _prays your little friend_:\nso I said\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will be telling them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and here is what I did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took up my hand and kissed it.  This so surprised my spirits that I\ncried out like one hurt.  The colour came strong in her face, and she\nlooked at me and nodded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO yes, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is what I think of you.  The head\ngoes with the lips.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; not anything besides.  She kissed my hand, as she had kissed\nPrince Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, with a higher passion than the common kind of clay has\nany sense of.  Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her lover, nor\nhow far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a character.\nYet I could tell myself I had advanced some way, and that her heart had\nbeat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me.\n\nAfter that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial civility.\nIt was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in her voice had\nknocked directly at the door of my own tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI praise God for your kindness, dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell, my little\nfriend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d giving her that name which she had given to herself; with which\nI bowed and left her.\n\nMy way was down the glen of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge and\nSilvermills.  A path led in the foot of it, the water bickered and sang\nin the midst; the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west among long\nshadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new world\nof it at every corner.  With Catriona behind and Alan before me, I was\nlike one lifted up.  The place besides, and the hour, and the talking of\nthe water, infinitely pleased me; and I lingered in my steps and looked\nbefore and behind me as I went.  This was the cause, under Providence,\nthat I spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes.\n\nAnger sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about and walked at a\nstiff pace to where I came from.  The path lay close by the bushes where\nI had remarked the head.  The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed\nI was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall.  No such thing\nbefell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that fear increased upon me.  It\nwas still day indeed, but the place exceeding solitary.  If my haunters\nhad let slip that fair occasion I could but judge they aimed at something\nmore than David Balfour.  The lives of Alan and James weighed upon my\nspirit with the weight of two grown bullocks.\n\nCatriona was yet in the garden walking by herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou see me back again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith a changed face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI carry two men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives besides my own,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be a sin and\nshame not to walk carefully.  I was doubtful whether I did right to come\nhere.  I would like it ill, if it was by that means we were brought to\nharm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could tell you one that would be liking it less, and will like little\nenough to hear you talking at this very same time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nhave I done, at all events?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, you I you are not alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut since I went off I have\nbeen dogged again, and I can give you the name of him that follows me.\nIt is Neil, son of Duncan, your man or your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure you are mistaken there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a white face.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeil\nis in Edinburgh on errands from my father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is what I fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe last of it.  But for his being in\nEdinburgh I think I can show you another of that.  For sure you have some\nsignal, a signal of need, such as would bring him to your help, if he was\nanywhere within the reach of ears and legs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, how will you know that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born, and the\nname they call it by is Common-sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOblige me so far as make\nyour signal, and I will show you the red head of Neil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp.  My heart was bitter.  I blamed\nmyself and the girl and hated both of us: her for the vile crew that she\nwas come of, myself for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in such a\nbyke of wasps.\n\nCatriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once, with an exceeding\nclear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  A while we stood\nsilent; and I was about to ask her to repeat the same, when I heard the\nsound of some one bursting through the bushes below on the braeside.  I\npointed in that direction with a smile, and presently Neil leaped into\nthe garden.  His eyes burned, and he had a black knife (as they call it\non the Highland side) naked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his\nmistress, stood like a man struck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has come to your call,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cjudge how near he was to Edinburgh,\nor what was the nature of your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errands.  Ask himself.  If I am\nto lose my life, or the lives of those that hang by me, through the means\nof your clan, let me go where I have to go with my eyes open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic.  Remembering Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anxious\ncivility in that particular, I could have laughed out loud for\nbitterness; here, sure, in the midst of these suspicions, was the hour\nshe should have stuck by English.\n\nTwice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make out that Neil (for\nall his obsequiousness) was an angry man.\n\nThen she turned to me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe swears it is not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you believe the man yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made a gesture like wringing the hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow will I can know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I must find some means to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot continue to go\ndovering round in the black night with two men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives at my girdle!\nCatriona, try to put yourself in my place, as I vow to God I try hard to\nput myself in yours.  This is no kind of talk that should ever have\nfallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my heart is sick with it.\nSee, keep him here till two of the morning, and I care not.  Try him with\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey spoke together once more in the Gaelic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says he has James More my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  She was whiter\nthan ever, and her voice faltered as she said it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is pretty plain now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand may God forgive the wicked!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said never anything to that, but continued gazing at me with the same\nwhite face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a fine business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I to fall, then, and those\ntwo along with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, what am I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould I go against my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders,\nhim in prison, in the danger of his life!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut perhaps we go too fast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis may be a lie too.  He may\nhave no right orders; all may be contrived by Simon, and your father\nknowing nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe burst out weeping between the pair of us; and my heart smote me hard,\nfor I thought this girl was in a dreadful situation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep him but the one hour; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll chance it, and may\nGod bless you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe put out her hand to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will he needing one good word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsobbed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe full hour, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, keeping her hand in mine.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree lives of\nit, my lass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe full hour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and cried aloud on her Redeemer to forgive\nher.\n\nI thought it no fit place for me, and fled.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE WOOD BY SILVERMILLS\n\n\nI lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge and\nSilvermills as hard as I could stave.  It was Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tryst to be every\nnight between twelve and two \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a bit scrog of wood by east of\nSilvermills and by south the south mill-lade.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  This I found easy enough,\nwhere it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade flowing swift and deep\nalong the foot of it; and here I began to walk slower and to reflect more\nreasonably on my employment.  I saw I had made but a fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bargain with\nCatriona.  It was not to be supposed that Neil was sent alone upon his\nerrand, but perhaps he was the only man belonging to James More; in which\ncase I should have done all I could to hang Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, and\nnothing the least material to help myself.  To tell the truth, I fancied\nneither one of these ideas.  Suppose by holding back Neil, the girl\nshould have helped to hang her father, I thought she would never forgive\nherself this side of time.  And suppose there were others pursuing me\nthat moment, what kind of a gift was I come bringing to Alan? and how\nwould I like that?\n\nI was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations\nstruck me like a cudgel.  My feet stopped of themselves and my heart\nalong with them.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat wild game is this that I have been playing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nthought I; and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere.\n\nThis brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village with\na crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland, there was\nnobody stirring.  Here was my advantage, here was just such a conjuncture\nas Stewart had counselled me to profit by, and I ran by the side of the\nmill-lade, fetched about beyond the east corner of the wood, threaded\nthrough the midst of it, and returned to the west selvage, whence I could\nagain command the path, and yet be myself unseen.  Again it was all\nempty, and my heart began to rise.\n\nFor more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees, and no hare\nor eagle could have kept a more particular watch.  When that hour began\nthe sun was already set, but the sky still all golden and the daylight\nclear; before the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk, the images\nand distances of things were mingled, and observation began to be\ndifficult.  All that time not a foot of man had come east from\nSilvermills, and the few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and\ntheir wives upon the road to bed.  If I were tracked by the most cunning\nspies in Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they could\nhave any jealousy of where I was: and going a little further home into\nthe wood I lay down to wait for Alan.\n\nThe strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched not the path\nonly, but every bush and field within my vision.  That was now at an end.\nThe moon, which was in her first quarter, glinted a little in the wood;\nall round there was a stillness of the country; and as I lay there on my\nback, the next three or four hours, I had a fine occasion to review my\nconduct.\n\nTwo things became plain to me first: that I had no right to go that day\nto Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to be lying where I\nwas.  This (where Alan was to come) was just the one wood in all broad\nScotland that was, by every proper feeling, closed against me; I admitted\nthat, and yet stayed on, wondering at myself.  I thought of the measure\nwith which I had meted to Catriona that same night; how I had prated of\nthe two lives I carried, and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and how I was here exposing them again, it seemed in\nwantonness.  A good conscience is eight parts of courage.  No sooner had\nI lost conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand disarmed amidst a\nthrong of terrors.  Of a sudden I sat up.  How if I went now to\nPrestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before he slept, and\nmade a full submission?  Who could blame me?  Not Stewart the Writer; I\nhad but to say that I was followed, despaired of getting clear, and so\ngave in.  Not Catriona: here, too, I had my answer ready; that I could\nnot bear she should expose her father.  So, in a moment, I could lay all\nthese troubles by, which were after all and truly none of mine; swim\nclear of the Appin Murder; get forth out of hand-stroke of all the\nStewarts and Campbells, all the Whigs and Tories, in the land; and live\nhenceforth to my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my\nfortunes, and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona, which\nwould be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run and be\nfollowed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the dreadful miseries\nof my escape with Alan.\n\nAt first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only amazed I had\nnot thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and began to inquire into\nthe causes of the change.  These I traced to my lowness of spirits, that\nback to my late recklessness, and that again to the common, old, public,\ndisconsidered sin of self-indulgence.  Instantly the text came in my\nhead, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_How can Satan cast out Satan_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  What? (I thought) I had, by\nself-indulgence; and the following of pleasant paths, and the lure of a\nyoung maid, cast myself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and\njeopardised the lives of James and Alan?  And I was to seek the way out\nby the same road as I had entered in?  No; the hurt that had been caused\nby self-indulgence must be cured by self-denial; the flesh I had pampered\nmust be crucified.  I looked about me for that course which I least liked\nto follow: this was to leave the wood without waiting to see Alan, and go\nforth again alone, in the dark and in the midst of my perplexed and\ndangerous fortunes.\n\nI have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections,\nbecause I think it is of some utility, and may serve as an example to\nyoung men.  But there is reason (they say) in planting kale, and even in\nethic and religion, room for common sense.  It was already close on\nAlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hour, and the moon was down.  If I left (as I could not very\ndecently whistle to my spies to follow me) they might miss me in the dark\nand tack themselves to Alan by mistake.  If I stayed, I could at the\nleast of it set my friend upon his guard which might prove his mere\nsalvation.  I had adventured other peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safety in a course of\nself-indulgence; to have endangered them again, and now on a mere design\nof penance, would have been scarce rational.  Accordingly, I had scarce\nrisen from my place ere I sat down again, but already in a different\nframe of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness and\nrejoicing in my present composure.\n\nPresently after came a crackling in the thicket.  Putting my mouth near\ndown to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s air; an answer\ncame in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked together in the\ndark.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this you at last, Davie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod, man, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wearying to see ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the\nlongest kind of a time.  A\u00e2\u0080\u0099 day, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had my dwelling into the inside of\na stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers; and then\ntwo hours of it waiting here for you, and you never coming!  Dod, and\nye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re none too soon the way it is, with me to sail the morn!  The morn?\nwhat am I saying?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the day, I mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, Alan, man, the day, sure enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s past twelve now,\nsurely, and ye sail the day.  This\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a long road you have before\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a long crack of it first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you to hear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\nAnd I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but clear\nenough when done.  He heard me out with very few questions, laughing here\nand there like a man delighted: and the sound of his laughing (above all\nthere, in the dark, where neither one of us could see the other) was\nextraordinary friendly to my heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, Davie, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a queer character,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, when I had done: \u00e2\u0080\u009ca queer\nbitch after a\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and I have no mind of meeting with the like of ye.  As\nfor your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say the\nless of him; and, dod! I believe he was the best friend ye had, if ye\ncould only trust him.  But Simon Fraser and James More are my ain kind of\ncattle, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them the name that they deserve.  The muckle black\ndeil was father to the Frasers, a\u00e2\u0080\u0099body kens that; and as for the Gregara,\nI never could abye the reek of them since I could stotter on two feet.  I\nbloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly on my legs\nthat I cowped upon the top of him.  A proud man was my father that day,\nGod rest him! and I think he had the cause.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never can deny but what\nRobin was something of a piper,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut as for James More, the\ndeil guide him for me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing we have to consider,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas Charles Stewart right or\nwrong?  Is it only me they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re after, or the pair of us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your ain opinion, you that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man of so much experience?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt passes me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd me too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo ye think this lass would keep her word to\nye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nae telling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd anyway, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over and done:\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many would ye think there would be of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat depends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it was only you, they would likely send\ntwo-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought that I was to\nappear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nIt was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number, or\nthe double of it, nearer hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt matters the less,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I am well rid of them for this\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNae doubt that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I wouldnae be the least\nsurprised if they were hunkering this wood.  Ye see, David man; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe Hieland folk.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be some Frasers, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking, and some of the\nGregara; and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the\nGregara in especial, were clever experienced persons.  A man kens little\ntill he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a\nthrong lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthere that I learned a great part of my penetration.  And ye need nae\ntell me: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than war; which is the next best, however, though\ngenerally rather a bauchle of a business.  Now the Gregara have had grand\npractice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a branch of education that was left out with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nI.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning: ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nignorat, and ye cannae see \u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Wae\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me for my Greek and Hebrew; but,\nman, I ken that I dinnae ken them\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the differ of it.  Now, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyou.  Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and ye tell\nme that ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors.  Why?  _Because I\ncouldnae see them_, says you.  Ye blockhead, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their livelihood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake the worst of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what are we to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thinking of that same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might twine.  It wouldnae be\ngreatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons against it.  First,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now unco dark, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just humanly possible we might give them the\nclean slip.  If we keep together, we make but the ae line of it; if we\ngang separate, we make twae of them: the more likelihood to stave in upon\nsome of these gentry of yours.  And then, second, if they keep the track\nof us, it may come to a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll confess I\nwould be blythe to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none\nthe worse of having me at yours.  So, by my way of it, we should creep\nout of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute, and\nhold away east for Gillane, where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m to find my ship.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be like old\ndays while it lasts, Davie; and (come the time) we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to think what\nyou should be doing.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wae to leave ye here, wanting me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave with ye, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo ye gang back where you were stopping?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeil a fear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were good folks to me, but I think they\nwould be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again.  For\n(the way times go) I am nae just what ye could call a Walcome Guest.\nWhich makes me the keener for your company, Mr. David Balfour of the\nShaws, and set ye up!  For, leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with\nCharlie Stewart, I have scarce said black or white since the day we\nparted at Corstorphine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly eastward\nthrough the wood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\u00e2\u0080\u0094ON THE MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN\n\n\nIt was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have said) was down; a\nstrongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack of cloud, had set in suddenly from\nthe west; and we began our movement in as black a night as ever a\nfugitive or a murderer wanted.  The whiteness of the path guided us into\nthe sleeping town of Broughton, thence through Picardy, and beside my old\nacquaintance the gibbet of the two thieves.  A little beyond we made a\nuseful beacon, which was a light in an upper window of Lochend.  Steering\nby this, but a good deal at random, and with some trampling of the\nharvest, and stumbling and falling down upon the banks, we made our way\nacross country, and won forth at last upon the linky, boggy muirland that\nthey call the Figgate Whins.  Here, under a bush of whin, we lay down the\nremainder of that night and slumbered.\n\nThe day called us about five.  A beautiful morning it was, the high\nwesterly wind still blowing strong, but the clouds all blown away to\nEurope.  Alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself.  It was my\nfirst sight of my friend since we were parted, and I looked upon him with\nenjoyment.  He had still the same big great-coat on his back; but (what\nwas new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose drawn above the knee.\nDoubtless these were intended for disguise; but, as the day promised to\nbe warm, he made a most unseasonable figure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this no a bonny morning?  Here is a day that\nlooks the way that a day ought to.  This is a great change of it from the\nbelly of my haystack; and while you were there sottering and sleeping I\nhave done a thing that maybe I do very seldom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, just said my prayers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where are my gentry, as ye call them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGude kens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the short and the long of it is that we must\ntake our chance of them.  Up with your foot-soles, Davie!  Forth,\nFortune, once again of it!  And a bonny walk we are like to have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where the salt-pans were\nsmoking in by the Esk mouth.  No doubt there was a by-ordinary bonny\nblink of morning sun on Arthur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Seat and the green Pentlands; and the\npleasantness of the day appeared to set Alan among nettles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel like a gomeral,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be leaving Scotland on a day like\nthis.  It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better to stay here\nand hing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but ye wouldnae, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, but what France is a good place too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some\nway no the same.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brawer I believe, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no Scotland.  I like it\nfine when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m there, man; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the\nScots peat-reek.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all you have to complain of, Alan, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no such great affair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand me but\nnew out of yon deil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haystack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so you were unco weary of your haystack?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nae word for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not just precisely a man that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\neasily cast down; but I do better with caller air and the lift above my\nhead.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like the auld Black Douglas (wasnae\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?) that likit better to\nhear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep.  And yon place, ye see,\nDavie\u00e2\u0080\u0094whilk was a very suitable place to hide in, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m free to own\u00e2\u0080\u0094was\npit mirk from dawn to gloaming.  There were days (or nights, for how\nwould I tell one from other?) that seemed to me as long as a long\nwinter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you know the hour to bide your tryst?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy, and a candle-dowp to\neat it by, about eleeven,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, when I had swallowed a bit, it\nwould he time to be getting to the wood.  There I lay and wearied for ye\nsore, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, laying his hand on my shoulder \u00e2\u0080\u009cand guessed when\nthe two hours would be about by\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless Charlie Stewart would come and\ntell me on his watch\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then back to the dooms haystack.  Na, it was a\ndriech employ, and praise the Lord that I have warstled through with it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you do with yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best I could!  Whiles I played at the\nknucklebones.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones, but\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye.  And\nwhiles I would make songs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat were they about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, about the deer and the heather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand about the ancient old\nchiefs that are all by with it lang syne, and just about what songs are\nabout in general.  And then whiles I would make believe I had a set of\npipes and I was playing.  I played some grand springs, and I thought I\nplayed them awful bonny; I vow whiles that I could hear the squeal of\nthem!  But the great affair is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that he carried me again to my adventures, which he heard all over\nagain with more particularity, and extraordinary approval, swearing at\nintervals that I was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca queer character of a callant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo ye were frich\u00e2\u0080\u0099ened of Sim Fraser?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked once.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth was I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo would I have been, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is indeed a driedful\nman.  But it is only proper to give the deil his due: and I can tell you\nhe is a most respectable person on the field of war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he so brave?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is as brave as my steel sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe story of my duel set him beside himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think of that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI showed ye the trick in Corrynakiegh\ntoo.  And three times\u00e2\u0080\u0094three times disarmed!  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disgrace upon my\ncharacter that learned ye!  Here, stand up, out with your airn; ye shall\nwalk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and\nme mair credit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is midsummer madness.  Here is no time for fencing\nlessons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannae well say no to that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut three times, man!  And\nyou standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword\nlike a doggie with a pocket-napkin!  David, this man Duncansby must be\nsomething altogether by-ordinar!  He maun be extraordinar skilly.  If I\nhad the time, I would gang straight back and try a turn at him mysel\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\nThe man must be a provost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou silly fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou forget it was just me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut three times!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I never heard tell the equal of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promise you the one thing, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe next time that we\nforgather, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be better learned.  You shall not continue to bear the\ndisgrace of a friend that cannot strike.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, the next time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when will that be, I would like to\nken?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my plan\nis this.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my opinion to be called an advocate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but a weary trade, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand rather a blagyard one\nforby.  Ye would be better in a king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat than that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut as\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in King Lewie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in King Geordie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\na dainty meeting of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some sense in that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn advocate, then, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think it a\nmore suitable trade for a gentleman that was _three times_ disarmed.  But\nthe beauty of the thing is this: that one of the best colleges for that\nkind of learning\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the one where my kinsman, Pilrig, made his\nstudies\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the college of Leyden in Holland.  Now, what say you, Alan?\nCould not a cadet of _Royal Ecossais_ get a furlough, slip over the\nmarches, and call in upon a Leyden student?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I would think he could!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see, I stand well in\nwith my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mair to the purpose\nI have a cousin of mine lieutenant-colonel in a regiment of the\nScots-Dutch.  Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a leave\nto see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  And Lord Melfort, who is\na very scienteefic kind of a man, and writes books like C\u00c3\u00a6sar, would be\ndoubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Lord Meloort an author, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, for much as Alan thought of\nsoldiers, I thought more of the gentry that write books.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very same, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne would think a colonel would have\nsomething better to attend to.  But what can I say that make songs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit only remains you should give me an address to\nwrite you at in France; and as soon as I am got to Leyden I will send you\nmine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCharles Stewart, of Ardsheil, Esquire, at the town of Melons, in the\nIsle of France.  It might take long, or it might take short, but it would\naye get to my hands at the last of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh, where it amused me\nvastly to hear Alan.  His great-coat and boot-hose were extremely\nremarkable this warm morning, and perhaps some hint of an explanation had\nbeen wise; but Alan went into that matter like a business, or I should\nrather say, like a diversion.  He engaged the goodwife of the house with\nsome compliments upon the rizzoring of our haddocks; and the whole of the\nrest of our stay held her in talk about a cold he had taken on his\nstomach, gravely relating all manner of symptoms and sufferings, and\nhearing with a vast show of interest all the old wives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remedies she\ncould supply him with in return.\n\nWe left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from\nEdinburgh for (as Alan said) that was a rencounter we might very well\navoid.  The wind although still high, was very mild, the sun shone\nstrong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion.  From Prestonpans he had\nme aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself a great deal\nmore than needful to describe the stages of the battle.  Thence, at his\nold round pace, we travelled to Cockenzie.  Though they were building\nherring-busses there at Mrs. Cadell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it seemed a desert-like,\nback-going town, about half full of ruined houses; but the ale-house was\nclean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must indulge himself with\na bottle of ale, and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the\ncold upon his stomach, only now the symptoms were all different.\n\nI sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had scarce ever heard him\naddress three serious words to any woman, but he was always drolling and\nfleering and making a private mock of them, and yet brought to that\nbusiness a remarkable degree of energy and interest.  Something to this\neffect I remarked to him, when the good-wife (as chanced) was called\naway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do ye want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA man should aye put his best foot forrit\nwith the womankind; he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert\nthem, the poor lambs!  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye\nshould get the principles, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a trade.  Now, if this had been a\nyoung lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would never have heard tell of my\nstomach, Davie.  But aince they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too old to be seeking joes, they a\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nset up to be apotecaries.  Why?  What do I ken?  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be just the way\nGod made them, I suppose.  But I think a man would be a gomeral that\ndidnae give his attention to the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as if with impatience\nto renew their former conversation.  The lady had branched some while\nbefore from Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach to the case of a goodbrother of her own in\nAberlady, whose last sickness and demise she was describing at\nextraordinary length.  Sometimes it was merely dull, sometimes both dull\nand awful, for she talked with unction.  The upshot was that I fell in a\ndeep muse, looking forth of the window on the road, and scarce marking\nwhat I saw.  Presently had any been looking they might have seen me to\nstart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe pit a fomentation to his feet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the good-wife was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a het\nstane to his wame, and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal, and\nfine, clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast. . . \u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, cutting very quietly in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a friend of mine gone by\nthe house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en sae?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replies Alan, as though it were a thing of small\naccount.  And then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe were saying, mem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; and the wearyful wife\nwent on.\n\nPresently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece, and she must go\nforth after the change.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas it him with the red head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Alan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe have it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did I tell you in the wood?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strange he\nshould be here too!  Was he his lane?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis lee-lane for what I could see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he gang by?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStraight by,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand looked neither to the right nor left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s queerer yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sticks in my mind, Davie, that\nwe should be stirring.  But where to?\u00e2\u0080\u0094deil hae\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!  This is like old days\nfairly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one big differ, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat now we have money in our\npockets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd another big differ, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat now we have dogs at\nour tail.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the scent; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in full cry, David.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bad\nbusiness and be damned to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And he sat thinking hard with a look of\nhis that I knew well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying, Luckie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, when the goodwife returned, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave ye a\nback road out of this change house?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe told him there was and where it led to.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that will be the shortest road for\nus.  And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no forget thon of\nthe cinnamon water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe went out by way of the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kale yard, and up a lane among fields.\nAlan looked sharply to all sides, and seeing we were in a little hollow\nplace of the country, out of view of men, sat down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow for a council of war, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut first of all, a bit\nlesson to ye.  Suppose that I had been like you, what would yon old wife\nhave minded of the pair of us!  Just that we had gone out by the back\ngate.  And what does she mind now?  A fine, canty, friendly, cracky man,\nthat suffered with the stomach, poor body! and was real ta\u00e2\u0080\u0099en up about\nthe goodbrother.  O man, David, try and learn to have some kind of\nintelligence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now for him of the red head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas he gaun fast or slow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBetwixt and between,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo kind of a hurry about the man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever a sign of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNhm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit looks queer.  We saw nothing of them this morning\non the Whins; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passed us by, he doesnae seem to be looking, and yet\nhere he is on our road!  Dod, Davie, I begin to take a notion.  I think\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no you they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeking, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me; and I think they ken fine\nwhere they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey ken?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Andie Scougal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sold me\u00e2\u0080\u0094him or his mate wha kent some part of\nthe affair\u00e2\u0080\u0094or else Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clerk callant, which would be a pity too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays Alan; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if you askit me for just my inward private conviction, I\nthink there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be heads cracked on Gillane sands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at all right there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be folk there and to\nspare.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be small service to crack heads.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would aye be a satisfaction though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut bide a bit;\nbide a bit; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking\u00e2\u0080\u0094and thanks to this bonny westland wind, I\nbelieve I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still a chance of it.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this way, Davie.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no trysted\nwith this man Scougal till the gloaming comes.  _But_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_if I\ncan get a bit of a wind out of the west I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there long or that_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsays, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_and lie-to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra_.  Now if your gentry\nkens the place, they ken the time forbye.  Do ye see me coming, Davie?\nThanks to Johnnie Cope and other red-coat gomerals, I should ken this\ncountry like the back of my hand; and if ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready for another bit run\nwith Alan Breck, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can cast back inshore, and come to the seaside\nagain by Dirleton.  If the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try and get on board of\nher.  If she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no there, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to get back to my weary haystack.\nBut either way of it, I think we will leave your gentry whistling on\ntheir thumbs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some chance in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave on with ye, Alan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\u00e2\u0080\u0094GILLANE SANDS\n\n\nI did not profit by Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pilotage as he had done by his marchings under\nGeneral Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went.  It is my excuse\nthat we travelled exceeding fast.  Some part we ran, some trotted, and\nthe rest walked at a vengeance of a pace.  Twice, while we were at top\nspeed, we ran against country-folk; but though we plumped into the first\nfrom round a corner, Alan was as ready as a loaded musket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas ye seen my horse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gasped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the countryman.\n\nAnd Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling \u00e2\u0080\u009cride\nand tie\u00e2\u0080\u009d; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared he had gone\nhome to Linton.  Not only that, but he expended some breath (of which he\nhad not very much left) to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity\nwhich was said to be its cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThem that cannae tell the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he observed to myself as we went on\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshould be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy lee behind them.\nIf folk dinnae ken what ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, Davie, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re terrible taken up\nwith it; but if they think they ken, they care nae mair for it than what\nI do for pease porridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie very near\ndue north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the left; on the\nright, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was thus we struck the shore\nagain, not far from Dirleton.  From north Berwick west to Gillane Ness\nthere runs a string of four small islets, Craiglieth, the Lamb, Fidra,\nand Eyebrough, notable by their diversity of size and shape.  Fidra is\nthe most particular, being a strange grey islet of two humps, made the\nmore conspicuous by a piece of ruin; and I mind that (as we drew closer\nto it) by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like\na man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye.  Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in\nwesterly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could see the _Thistle_\nriding.\n\nThe shore in face of these islets is altogether waste.  Here is no\ndwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond children\nrunning at their play.  Gillane is a small place on the far side of the\nNess, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields, and\nthose of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing from their haven; so\nthat few parts of the coast are lonelier.  But I mind, as we crawled upon\nour bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a\nbright eye upon all sides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there\nwas such a shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the\nbent grass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying\ngulls, that the desert seemed to me, like a place alive.  No doubt it was\nin all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the secret had been\nkept; and even now that it was out, and the place watched, we were able\nto creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills, where they look down\nimmediately on the beach and sea.\n\nBut here Alan came to a full stop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a kittle passage!  As long as we lie here\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of\nFrance.  And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another\nmatter.  For where will your gentry be, think ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no come yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd even if they are, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one\nclear matter in our favour.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all arranged to take us, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntrue.  But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we\nare upon their west.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish we were in some force, and this was a battle, we\nwould have bonnily out-man\u00c5\u0093uvred them!  But it isnae, Davit; and the way\nit is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck.  I swither, Davie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime flies, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken naething else, as the French folk say.\nBut this is a dreidful case of heids or tails.  O! if I could but ken\nwhere your gentry were!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is no like you.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be now or never.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is no me, quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nsang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither you nor me, quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he, neither you nor me.\n    Wow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with a\nhandkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the beach.  I\nstood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the sand-hills to the\neast.  His appearance was at first unremarked: Scougal not expecting him\nso early, and _my gentry_ watching on the other side.  Then they awoke on\nboard the _Thistle_, and it seemed they had all in readiness, for there\nwas scarce a second\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round\nher stern and begin to pull lively for the coast.  Almost at the same\nmoment of time, and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane Ness, the\nfigure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill, waving with his\narms; and though he was gone again in the same flash, the gulls in that\npart continued a little longer to fly wild.\n\nAlan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at the ship and\nskiff.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt maun be as it will!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, when I had told him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel may yon\nboatie row, or my craig\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to thole a raxing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking when the\ntide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to the\nsea; and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of a\ntown.  No eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the\nbents, no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming: time\nstood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one thing I would like to ken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d say Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to ken\nthese gentry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worth four hunner pound the pair of us: how\nif they took the guns to us, Davie!  They would get a bonny shot from the\ntop of that lang sandy bank.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMorally impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe point is that they can have no guns.\nThis thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they may have, but\nnever guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in the right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor all which I am\nwearing a good deal for yon boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog.\n\nIt was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already hard\non the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over my shoes.\nThere was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look as much as we were\nable at the creeping nearer of the boat, and as little as we could manage\nat the long impenetrable front of the sandhills, over which the gulls\ntwinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan\nsuddenly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, man, I wish that I had your courage!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat kind of talk is this of it!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just made of\ncourage; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the character of the man, as I could prove myself if there\nwas nobody else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you would be the more mistaken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat makes the differ\nwith me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs.  But for\nauld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit to hold a candle to\nyourself.  Look at us two here upon the sands.  Here am I, fair hotching\nto be off; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you (for all that I ken) in two minds of it whether\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no stop.  Do you think that I could do that, or would?  No me!\nFirstly, because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur; and\nsecondly, because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye\ndamned first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, man Alan, you can wile\nyour old wives, but you never can wile me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRemembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a tryst to keep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am trysted with your cousin\nCharlie; I have passed my word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBraw trysts that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can keep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just mistryst\naince and for a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with the gentry in the bents.  And what for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on\nwith an extreme threatening gravity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust tell me that, my mannie!  Are\nye to be speerited away like Lady Grange?  Are they to drive a dirk in\nyour inside and bury ye in the bents?  Or is it to be the other way, and\nare they to bring ye in with James?  Are they folk to be trustit?  Would\nye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded with extraordinary bitterness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all rogues and liars, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m with ye there.\nThe more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves!\nMy word is passed, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stick to it.  I said long syne to your\nkinswoman that I would stumble at no risk.  Do ye mind of that?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the night\nRed Colin fell, it was.  No more I will, then.  Here I stop.\nPrestongrange promised me my life: if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be mansworn, here I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nto die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel aweel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.\n\nAll this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers.  In truth we\nhad caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was to learn\nafterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there was of them was\nspread among the bents towards Gillane.  It was quite an affair to call\nthem in and bring them over, and the boat was making speed.  They were\nbesides but cowardly fellows: a mere leash of Highland cattle-thieves, of\nseveral clans, no gentleman there to be the captain and the more they\nlooked at Alan and me upon the beach, the less (I must suppose) they\nliked the look of us.\n\nWhoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain: he was in the skiff\nhimself, steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man with his heart\nin his employ.  Already he was near in, and the boat securing\u00e2\u0080\u0094already\nAlan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face had flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance,\nwhen our friends in the bents, either in their despair to see their prey\nescape them or with some hope of scaring Andie, raised suddenly a shrill\ncry of several voices.\n\nThis sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast, was\nreally very daunting, and the men in the boat held water instantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d sings out the captain, for he was come within an\neasy hail.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFreens o\u00e2\u0080\u0099mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth in the\nshallow water towards the boat.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pausing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie, are\nye no coming?  I am swier to leave ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a hair of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water,\nhesitating.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, and swashing in deeper\nthan his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was immediately directed\nfor the ship.\n\nI stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan sat with\nhis head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly away.  Of a\nsudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and seemed to myself\nthe most deserted solitary lad in Scotland.  With that I turned my back\nupon the sea and faced the sandhills.  There was no sight or sound of\nman; the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry, the wind blew in the\nbents, the gulls made a dreary piping.  As I passed higher up the beach,\nthe sand-lice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles.  The devil\nany other sight or sound in that unchancy place.  And yet I knew there\nwere folk there, observing me, upon some secret purpose.  They were no\nsoldiers, or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless\nthey were some common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap,\nperhaps to murder me outright.  From the position of those engaged, the\nfirst was the more likely; from what I knew of their character and\nardency in this business, I thought the second very possible; and the\nblood ran cold about my heart.\n\nI had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though I was\nvery unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade, I thought I could\ndo some scathe in a random combat.  But I perceived in time the folly of\nresistance.  This was no doubt the joint \u00e2\u0080\u009cexpedient\u00e2\u0080\u009d on which\nPrestongrange and Fraser were agreed.  The first, I was very sure, had\ndone something to secure my life; the second was pretty likely to have\nslipped in some contrary hints into the ears of Neil and his companions;\nand if I were to show bare steel I might play straight into the hands of\nmy worst enemy and seal my own doom.\n\nThese thoughts brought me to the head of the beach.  I cast a look\nbehind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his handkerchief for\na farewell, which I replied to with the waving of my hand.  But Alan\nhimself was shrunk to a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass\nthat lay in front of me.  I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my\nteeth, and went right before me up the face of the sand-wreath.  It made\na hard climb, being steep, and the sand like water underfoot.  But I\ncaught hold at last by the long bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled\nmyself to a good footing.  The same moment men stirred and stood up here\nand there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger\nin his hand.  The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed.  When I\nopened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without\nspeech or hurry.  Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange\nsensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they continued\nto approach me.  I held out my hands empty; whereupon one asked, with a\nstrong Highland brogue, if I surrendered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder protest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ye ken what that means, which I misdoubt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a\ncarrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from my pockets,\nbound me hand and foot with some strong line, and cast me on a tussock of\nbent.  There they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed\nupon him silently like something dangerous, perhaps a lion or a tiger on\nthe spring.  Presently this attention was relaxed.  They drew nearer\ntogether, fell to speech in the Gaelic, and very cynically divided my\nproperty before my eyes.  It was my diversion in this time that I could\nwatch from my place the progress of my friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape.  I saw the boat\ncome to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill, and the ship pass out\nseaward behind the isles and by North Berwick.\n\nIn the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen kept\ncollecting.  Neil among the first, until the party must have numbered\nnear a score.  With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk, that\nsounded like complaints and explanations; but I observed one thing, none\nof those who came late had any share in the division of my spoils.  The\nlast discussion was very violent and eager, so that once I thought they\nwould have quarrelled; on the heels of which their company parted, the\nbulk of them returning westward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two\nothers, remaining sentries on the prisoner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work,\nNeil Duncanson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, when the rest had moved away.\n\nHe assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew he was\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cacquent wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the leddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon that\nportion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the Highland\nmountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark.  At which hour I\nwas aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man of a very swarthy\ncountenance, that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLads,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas ye a paper like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and held up one in his\nhand.  Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied through a pair\nof horn spectacles, and saying all was right and we were the folk he was\nseeking, immediately dismounted.  I was then set in his place, my feet\ntied under the horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly, and we set forth under the guidance of the\nLowlander.  His path must have been very well chosen, for we met but one\npair\u00e2\u0080\u0094a pair of lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0094the whole way, and these, perhaps taking us to be\nfree-traders, fled on our approach.  We were at one time close at the\nfoot of Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed over some\nopen hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church\namong some trees not far off, but too far to cry for help, if I had\ndreamed of it.  At last we came again within sound of the sea.  There was\nmoonlight, though not much; and by this I could see the three huge towers\nand broken battlements of Tantallon, that old chief place of the Red\nDouglases.  The horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch to graze,\nand I was led within, and forth into the court, and thence into the\ntumble-down stone hall.  Here my conductors built a brisk fire in the\nmidst of the pavement, for there was a chill in the night.  My hands were\nloosed, I was set by the wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander having\nproduced provisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French\nbrandy.  This done, I was left once more alone with my three Highlandmen.\nThey sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the wind blew in by the\nbreaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang in the tops of the\ntowers; I could hear the sea under the cliffs, and, my mind being\nreassured as to my life, and my body and spirits wearied with the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nemployment, I turned upon one side and slumbered.\n\nI had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the moon was\ndown and the fire was low.  My feet were now loosed, and I was carried\nthrough the ruins and down the cliff-side by a precipitous path to where\nI found a fisher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat in a haven of the rocks.  This I was had on board\nof, and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE BASS\n\n\nI had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here and there\nfor the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while in my head a word\nof Ransome\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094the_ twenty-pounders_.  If I were to be exposed a second\ntime to that same former danger of the plantations, I judged it must turn\nill with me; there was no second Alan; and no second shipwreck and spare\nyard to be expected now; and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlash.  The thought chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the\nstretchers of the boat drenched with a cold dew: and I shivered in my\nplace beside the steersman.  This was the dark man whom I have called\nhitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black Andie.\nFeeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed me a rough jacket\nfull of fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for this kindness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand will make so free as to\nrepay it with a warning.  You take a high responsibility in this affair.\nYou are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders, but know what the\nlaw is and the risks of those that break it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am no just exactly what ye would ca\u00e2\u0080\u0099 an extremist for the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the best of times; but in this business I act with a good\nwarranty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to do with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNae harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnae harm ava\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have strong freens, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nthinking.  Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be richt eneuch yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little dabs of\npink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east; and at the same\ntime the geese awakened, and began crying about the top of the Bass.  It\nis just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to\ncarve a city from.  The sea was extremely little, but there went a hollow\nplowter round the base of it.  With the growing of the dawn I could see\nit clearer and clearer; the straight crags painted with sea-birds\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndroppings like a morning frost, the sloping top of it green with grass,\nthe clan of white geese that cried about the sides, and the black, broken\nbuildings of the prison sitting close on the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge.\n\nAt the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust to the Bass, mannie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhaur the auld saints were afore\nye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut none dwells there now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe place is long a ruin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth\nAndie dryly.\n\nThe day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among the big\nstones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several kegs and\nbaskets, and a provision of fuel.  All these were discharged upon the\ncrag.  Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call them mine,\nalthough it was the other way about), landed along with them.  The sun\nwas not yet up when the boat moved away again, the noise of the oars on\nthe thole-pins echoing from the cliffs, and left us in our singular\nreclusion:\n\nAndie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the Bass,\nbeing at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich\nestate.  He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on\nthe grass of the sloping part of it, like beasts grazing the roof of a\ncathedral.  He had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in the\ncrags; and from these an extraordinary income is derived.  The young are\ndainty eating, as much as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and\npaid willingly by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their\noil and feathers; and a part of the minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stipend of North Berwick\nis paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in some folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eyes)\na parish to be coveted.  To perform these several businesses, as well as\nto protect the geese from poachers, Andie had frequent occasion to sleep\nand pass days together on the crag; and we found the man at home there\nlike a farmer in his steading.  Bidding us all shoulder some of the\npackages, a matter in which I made haste to bear a hand, he led us in by\na locked gate, which was the only admission to the island, and through\nthe ruins of the fortress, to the governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.  There we saw by the\nashes in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he made\nhis usual occupation.\n\nThis bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I would set up to\nbe gentry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bless God I\nhave lain hard ere now, and can do the same again with thankfulness.\nWhile I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your name, I will do my part and\ntake my place beside the rest of you; and I ask you on the other hand to\nspare me your mockery, which I own I like ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection to\napprove it.  Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and a good Whig\nand Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and was both able and\neager to converse seriously on religion, leaning more than a little\ntowards the Cameronian extremes.  His morals were of a more doubtful\ncolour.  I found he was deep in the free trade, and used the ruins of\nTantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise.  As for a gauger, I do\nnot believe he valued the life of one at half-a-farthing.  But that part\nof the coast of Lothian is to this day as wild a place, and the commons\nthere as rough a crew, as any in Scotland.\n\nOne incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it had\nlong after.  There was a warship at this time stationed in the Firth, the\n_Seahorse_, Captain Palliser.  It chanced she was cruising in the month\nof September, plying between Fife and Lothian, and sounding for sunk\ndangers.  Early one fine morning she was seen about two miles to east of\nus, where she lowered a boat, and seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks\nand Satan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bush, famous dangers of that coast.  And presently after\nhaving got her boat again, she came before the wind and was headed\ndirectly for the Bass.  This was very troublesome to Andie and the\nHighlanders; the whole business of my sequestration was designed for\nprivacy, and here, with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore, it\nlooked to become public enough, if it were nothing worse.  I was in a\nminority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was far from\nsure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition.  All\nwhich considered, I gave Andie my parole of good behaviour and obedience,\nand was had briskly to the summit of the rock, where we all lay down, at\nthe cliff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, in different places of observation and concealment.\nThe _Seahorse_ came straight on till I thought she would have struck, and\nwe (looking giddily down) could see the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s company at their quarters\nand hear the leadsman singing at the lead.  Then she suddenly wore and\nlet fly a volley of I know not how many great guns.  The rock was shaken\nwith the thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over our heads, and the\ngeese rose in number beyond computation or belief.  To hear their\nscreaming and to see the twinkling of their wings, made a most inimitable\ncuriosity; and I suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure\nthat Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass.  He was to pay dear for\nit in time.  During his approach I had the opportunity to make a remark\nupon the rigging of that ship by which I ever after knew it miles away;\nand this was a means (under Providence) of my averting from a friend a\ngreat calamity, and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible\ndisappointment.\n\nAll the time of my stay on the rock we lived well.  We had small ale and\nbrandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night and morning.  At\ntimes a boat came from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton,\nfor the sheep upon the rock we must not touch, these being specially fed\nto market.  The geese were unfortunately out of season, and we let them\nbe.  We fished ourselves, and yet more often made the geese to fish for\nus: observing one when he had made a capture and scaring him from his\nprey ere he had swallowed it.\n\nThe strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which it\nabounded, held me busy and amused.  Escape being impossible, I was\nallowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the surface of the\nisle wherever it might support the foot of man.  The old garden of the\nprison was still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs running wild,\nand some ripe cherries on a bush.  A little lower stood a chapel or a\nhermit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cell; who built or dwelt in it, none may know, and the thought\nof its age made a ground of many meditations.  The prison, too, where I\nnow bivouacked with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full of history,\nboth human and divine.  I thought it strange so many saints and martyrs\nshould have gone by there so recently, and left not so much as a leaf out\nof their Bibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while the rough soldier\nlads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood\nwith their mementoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094broken tobacco-pipes for the most part, and that in\na surprising plenty, but also metal buttons from their coats.  There were\ntimes when I thought I could have heard the pious sound of psalms out of\nthe martyr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dungeons, and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with\ntheir glinting pipes, and the dawn rising behind them out of the North\nSea.\n\nNo doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these fancies in\nmy head.  He was extraordinarily well acquainted with the story of the\nrock in all particulars, down to the names of private soldiers, his\nfather having served there in that same capacity.  He was gifted besides\nwith a natural genius for narration, so that the people seemed to speak\nand the things to be done before your face.  This gift of his and my\nassiduity to listen brought us the more close together.  I could not\nhonestly deny but what I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and\nindeed, from the first I had set myself out to capture his good-will.  An\nodd circumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond my\nexpectation; but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a\nprisoner and his gaoler.\n\nI should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the Bass\nwas wholly disagreeable.  It seemed to me a safe place, as though I was\nescaped there out of my troubles.  No harm was to be offered me; a\nmaterial impossibility, rock and the deep sea, prevented me from fresh\nattempts; I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe, and there were\ntimes when I allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters.  At\nother times my thoughts were very different, I recalled how strong I had\nexpressed myself both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my\ncaptivity upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife\nand Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented\nthan endured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at least, I must\npass for a boaster and a coward.  Now I would take this lightly enough;\ntell myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona Drummond, the\nopinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled water; and\nthence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are so delightful\nto himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to a reader.  But\nanon the fear would take me otherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect\npanic of self-esteem, and these supposed hard judgments appear an\ninjustice impossible to be supported.  With that another train of thought\nwould he presented, and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\njudgments of myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of James\nStewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife.  Then, indeed,\npassion began to work in me; I could not forgive myself to sit there\nidle: it seemed (if I were a man at all) that I could fly or swim out of\nmy place of safety; and it was in such humours and to amuse my\nself-reproaches that I would set the more particularly to win the good\nside of Andie Dale.\n\nAt last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright\nmorning, I put in some hint about a bribe.  He looked at me, cast back\nhis head, and laughed out loud.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re funny, Mr. Dale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut perhaps if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll glance an\neye upon that paper you may change your note.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure\nnothing but hard money, and the paper I now showed Andie was an\nacknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable sum.\n\nHe read it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, and ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nane sae ill aff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought that would maybe vary your opinions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHout!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shows me ye can bribe; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no to be bribit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see about that yet a while,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd first, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you\nthat I know what I am talking.  You have orders to detain me here till\nafter Thursday, 21st September.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re no a\u00e2\u0080\u0099thegether wrong either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m to let you gang,\nbar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this\narrangement.  That I was to re-appear precisely in time to be too late\nwould cast the more discredit on my tale, if I were minded to tell one;\nand this screwed me to fighting point.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and think while\nye listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know there are great folks in the business, and I\nmake no doubt you have their names to go upon.  I have seen some of them\nmyself since this affair began, and said my say into their faces too.\nBut what kind of a crime would this be that I had committed? or what kind\nof a process is this that I am fallen under?  To be apprehended by some\nragged John-Hielandman on August 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones\nthat is now neither fort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just the\ngamekeeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again, September 23rd,\nas secretly as I was first arrested\u00e2\u0080\u0094does that sound like law to you? or\ndoes it sound like justice? or does it not sound honestly like a piece of\nsome low dirty intrigue, of which the very folk that meddle with it are\nashamed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI canna gainsay ye, Shaws.  It looks unco underhand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nwerenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians I would has\nseen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Master of Lovat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a braw Whig,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand a grand\nPresbyterian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken naething by him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hae nae trokings wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Lovats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be Prestongrange that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be dealing with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no tell ye that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Andie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle need when I ken,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was my retort.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that is that (try as ye please) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no dealing wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099; nor yet\nI amnae goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Andie, I see I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to be speak out plain with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.\nAnd told him so much as I thought needful of the facts.\n\nHe heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done, seemed\nto consider a little with himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShaws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deal with the naked hand.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a queer\ntale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m far frae\nminting that is other than the way that ye believe it.  As for yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\nye seem to me rather a dacent-like young man.  But me, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aulder and\nmair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than\nwhat ye can dae.  And here the maitter clear and plain to ye.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe nae skaith to yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if I keep ye here; far free that, I think ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe a hantle better by it.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be nae skaith to the kintry\u00e2\u0080\u0094just ae\nmair Hielantman hangit\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gude kens, a guid riddance!  On the ither hand, it\nwould be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free.  Sae,\nspeakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as a guid Whig, an honest freen\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to you, and an anxious freen\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nto my ainsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the plain fact is that I think ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to bide\nhere wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Andie an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the solans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAndie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis Hielantman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninnocent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a peety about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ye see, in this warld, the\nway God made it, we cannae just get a\u00e2\u0080\u0099thing that we want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\u00e2\u0080\u0094BLACK ANDIE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\nI have yet said little of the Highlanders.  They were all three of the\nfollowers of James More, which bound the accusation very tight about\ntheir master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.  All understood a word or two of English, but Neil\nwas the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse, in\nwhich (when once he got embarked) his company was often tempted to the\ncontrary opinion.  They were tractable, simple creatures; showed much\nmore courtesy than might have been expected from their raggedness and\ntheir uncouth appearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three\nservants for Andie and myself.\n\nDwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of a prison,\nand among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea-birds, I thought\nI perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear.  When there\nwas nothing doing they would either lie and sleep, for which their\nappetite appeared insatiable, or Neil would entertain the others with\nstories which seemed always of a terrifying strain.  If neither of these\ndelights were within reach\u00e2\u0080\u0094if perhaps two were sleeping and the third\ncould find no means to follow their example\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would see him sit and\nlisten and look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his\nface blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow.  The nature\nof these fears I had never an occasion to find out, but the sight of them\nwas catching, and the nature of the place that we were in favourable to\nalarms.  I can find no word for it in the English, but Andie had an\nexpression for it in the Scots from which he never varied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an unco place_, _the Bass_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt is so I always think of it.  It was an unco place by night, unco by\nday; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the solans, and the\nplash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung continually in our ears.\nIt was chiefly so in moderate weather.  When the waves were anyway great\nthey roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies, dreadful\nbut merry to hear; and it was in the calm days that a man could daunt\nhimself with listening\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a Highlandman only, as I several times\nexperimented on myself, so many still, hollow noises haunted and\nreverberated in the porches of the rock.\n\nThis brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in, which\nquite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect on my\ndeparture.  It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the fire and\n(that little air of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming back to my memory) began to whistle.  A\nhand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of Neil bade me to stop, for it\nwas not \u00e2\u0080\u009ccanny musics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot canny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can that be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon\nhis body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d {13}\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere can be no bogles here, Neil; for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not likely\nthey would fash themselves to frighten geese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that what ye think of it!  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can tell ye\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been waur nor bogles here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waur than bogles, Andie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWarlocks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr a warlock at the least of it.  And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nqueer tale, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if ye would like, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell it ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander that had\nthe least English of the three set himself to listen with all his might.\n\n\nTHE TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK\n\n\nMY faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring lad in his\nyoung days, wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 little wisdom and little grace.  He was fond of a lass\nand fond of a glass, and fond of a ran-dan; but I could never hear tell\nthat he was muckle use for honest employment.  Frae ae thing to anither,\nhe listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this fort,\nwhich was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot upon the\nBass.  Sorrow upon that service!  The governor brewed his ain ale; it\nseems it was the warst conceivable.  The rock was proveesioned free the\nshore with vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles when\nthey but to fish and shoot solans for their diet.  To crown a\u00e2\u0080\u0099, thir was\nthe Days of the Persecution.  The perishin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cauld chalmers were all\noccupeed wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sants and martyrs, the saut of the yearth, of which it\nwasnae worthy.  And though Tam Dale carried a firelock there, a single\nsodger, and liked a lass and a glass, as I was sayin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the mind of the\nman was mair just than set with his position.  He had glints of the glory\nof the kirk; there were whiles when his dander rase to see the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsants misguided, and shame covered him that he should be haulding a\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099le (or carrying a firelock) in so black a business.  There were\nnights of it when he was here on sentry, the place a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wheesht, the frosts\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099 winter maybe riving in the wa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and he would hear ane o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the\nprisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and the blessed sounds\nrising from the different chalmers\u00e2\u0080\u0094or dungeons, I would raither say\u00e2\u0080\u0094so\nthat this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt of Heev\u00e2\u0080\u0099n.  Black shame\nwas on his saul; his sins hove up before him muckle as the Bass, and\nabove a\u00e2\u0080\u0099, that chief sin, that he should have a hand in hagging and\nhashing at Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kirk.  But the truth is that he resisted the spirit.\nDay cam, there were the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves\ndepairtit.\n\nIn thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet was\nhis name.  Ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden.  There was never the\nwale of him sinsyne, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mony if there ever was his\nlike afore.  He was wild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a peat-hag, fearsome to look at, fearsome to\nhear, his face like the day of judgment.  The voice of him was like a\nsolan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and dinnle\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in folks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lugs, and the words of him like coals of\nfire.\n\nNow there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little to do, for\nit was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she was bonny, and her\nand Tam Dale were very well agreed.  It befell that Peden was in the\ngairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass cam by; and what\nshould the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotions?  He\nrose and lookit at the twa o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 them, and Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees knoitered thegether\nat the look of him.  But whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in\nanger.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor thing, poor thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, and it was the lass he lookit\nat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear you skirl and laugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the Lord has a deid shot\nprepared for you, and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the\nae time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ntwa-three sodgers, and it was a blawy day.  There cam a gowst of wind,\nclaught her by the coats, and awa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her bag and baggage.  And it was\nremarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl.\n\nNae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it passed\nagain and him none the better.  Ae day he was flyting wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anither\nsodger-lad.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeil hae me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tam, for he was a profane swearer.  And\nthere was Peden glowering at him, gash an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 waefu\u00e2\u0080\u0099; Peden wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 his lang\nchafts an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 luntin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 een, the maud happed about his kist, and the hand of\nhim held out wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the black nails upon the finger-nebs\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he had nae care\nof the body.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFy, fy, poor man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe poor fool man!  _Deil\nhae me_, quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he; an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I see the deil at his oxter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The conviction of\nguilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang doun the pike\nthat was in his hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will nae mair lift arms against the cause o\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nChrist!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, and was as gude\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word.  There was a sair fyke in the\nbeginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved, gied him his discharge,\nand he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick, and had aye a gude\nname with honest folk free that day on.\n\nIt was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in the\nhands o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the Da\u00e2\u0080\u0099rymples, and there was twa men soucht the chairge of it.\nBaith were weel qualified, for they had baith been sodgers in the\ngarrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and the seasons and values\nof them.  Forby that they were baith\u00e2\u0080\u0094or they baith seemed\u00e2\u0080\u0094earnest\nprofessors and men of comely conversation.  The first of them was just\nTam Dale, my faither.  The second was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca\u00e2\u0080\u0099d Tod\nLapraik maistly, but whether for his name or his nature I could never\nhear tell.  Weel, Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business, and took\nme, that was a toddlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 laddie, by the hand.  Tod had his dwallin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the\nlang loan benorth the kirkyaird.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dark uncanny loan, forby that\nthe kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 James the Saxt and the\ndeevil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the seas; and as\nfor Tod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, it was in the mirkest end, and was little liked by some\nthat kenned the best.  The door was on the sneck that day, and me and my\nfaither gaed straucht in.  Tod was a wabster to his trade; his loom stood\nin the but.  There he sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a man like creish,\nwi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner.  The hand of him aye\ncawed the shuttle, but his een was steeked.  We cried to him by his name,\nwe skirled in the deid lug of him, we shook him by the shou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ther.  Nae\nmainner o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 service!  There he sat on his dowp, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cawed the shuttle and\nsmiled like creish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod be guid to us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tam Dale, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is no canny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this you, Tam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaith, man!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m blythe to see ye.  I\nwhiles fa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 into a bit dwam like this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says; \u00e2\u0080\u009cits frae the stamach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWeel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to get\nthe warding o\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, and little by little cam to very ill words, and twined\nin anger.  I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again, he cam\nower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod Lapraik and\nhis dwams.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDwam!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  It was\nremembered sinsyne what way he had ta\u00e2\u0080\u0099en the thing.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye\nhae gotten the better o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me aince mair, and I hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find\nat least a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that ye expeckit at the Bass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Which have since been thought\nremarkable expressions.  At last the time came for Tam Dale to take young\nsolans.  This was a business he was weel used wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099, he had been a\ncraigsman frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  So there was he\nhingin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by a line an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 speldering on the craig face, whaur its hieest and\nsteighest.  Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the line and\nmindin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for his signals.  But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the\ncraig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying.  It was a\nbraw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young geese.\nMony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard him tell of this experience, and aye the swat\nran upon the man.\n\nIt chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a muckle\nsolan, and the solan pyking at the line.  He thocht this by-ordinar and\noutside the creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s habits.  He minded that ropes was unco saft\nthings, and the solan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard, and that twa\nhunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShoo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Tam.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAwa\u00e2\u0080\u0099, bird!  Shoo, awa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nThe solan keekit doon into Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and there was something unco in\nthe creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ee.  Just the ae keek it gied, and back to the rope.  But\nnow it wroucht and warstl\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like a thing dementit.  There never was the\nsolan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht; and it seemed to\nunderstand its employ brawly, birzing the saft rope between the neb of it\nand a crunkled jag o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stane.\n\nThere gaed a cauld stend o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fear into Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis thing is nae\nbird,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thinks he.  His een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed\nblack aboot him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I get a dwam here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he toucht, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tam\nDale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And he signalled for the lads to pu\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him up.\n\nAnd it seemed the solan understood about signals.  For nae sooner was the\nsignal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings, squawked out loud,\ntook a turn flying, and dashed straucht at Tam Dale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s een.  Tam had a\nknife, he gart the cauld steel glitter.  And it seemed the solan\nunderstood about knives, for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun\nthan he gied the ae squawk, but laighter, like a body disappointit, and\nflegged aff about the roundness of the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair.\nAnd as sune as that thing was gane, Tam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heid drapt upon his shouther,\nand they pu\u00e2\u0080\u0099d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig.\n\nA dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to his mind,\nor what was left of it.  Up he sat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sure of the boat, man\u00e2\u0080\u0094rin!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncries, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor yon solan\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have it awa\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nThe fower lads stared at ither, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tried to whilly-wha him to be quiet.\nBut naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 them had startit on\naheid to stand sentry on the boat.  The ithers askit if he was for down\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand niether you nor me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as sune as I can\nwin to stand on my twa feet we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be aff frae this craig o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sawtan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for before they\nwon to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever.  He lay a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the simmer;\nand wha was sae kind as come speiring for him, but Tod Lapraik!  Folk\nthocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house the fever had\nworsened.  I kenna for that; but what I ken the best, that was the end of\nit.\n\nIt was about this time o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the year; my grandfaither was out at the white\nfishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him.  We had a grand take, I\nmind, and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the Bass, whaur\nwe foregaithered wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 anither boat that belanged to a man Sandie Fletcher\nin Castleton.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no lang deid neither, or ye could speir at himsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\nWeel, Sandie hailed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yon on the Bass?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn the Bass?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfaither.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Sandie, \u00e2\u0080\u009con the green side o\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatten kind of a thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfaither.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere cannae be naething\non the Bass but just the sheep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks unco like a body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sandie, who was nearer in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA body!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says we, and we none of us likit that.  For there was nae boat\nthat could have brought a man, and the key o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the prison yett hung ower\nmy faither\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at hame in the press bed.\n\nWe keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer hand.\nGrandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and the captain of a\nsmack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay.  And when we took the glass\nto it, sure eneuch there was a man.  He was in a crunkle o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 green brae, a\nwee below the chaipel, a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by his lee lane, and lowped and flang and\ndanced like a daft quean at a waddin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tod,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sandie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Sandie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr ane in the likeness o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfaither.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSma\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is the differ,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sandie.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDe\u00e2\u0080\u0099il or warlock, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try the gun\nat him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that he aye carried, for\nSandie was a notable famous shot in all that country.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaud your hand, Sandie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfaither; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe maun see clearer first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor this may be a dear day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wark to the baith of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHout!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Sandie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment surely, and be damned\nto it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe ay, and maybe no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says my grandfaither, worthy man!  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut have\nyou a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nforegaithered wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nThis was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel, Edie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what would be your way of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOu, just this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says grandfaither.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me that has the fastest boat\ngang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep an eye on\nThon.  If I cannae find Lapraik, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll join ye and the twa of us\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a\ncrack wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him.  But if Lapraik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at hame, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll rin up the flag at the\nharbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the gun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAweel, so it was agreed between them twa.  I was just a bairn, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clum\nin Sandie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat, whaur I thoucht I would see the best of the employ.  My\ngrandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the leid\ndraps, bein mair deidly again bogles.  And then the as boat set aff for\nNorth Berwick, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the tither lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy\nthing on the brae-side.\n\nA\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like a\nteetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span.  I hae seen\nlassies, the daft queans, that would lowp and dance a winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nicht, and\nstill be lowping and dancing when the winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day cam in.  But there\nwould be fowk there to hauld them company, and the lads to egg them on;\nand this thing was its lee-lane.  And there would be a fiddler diddling\nhis elbock in the chimney-side; and this thing had nae music but the\nskirling of the solans.  And the lassies were bits o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 young things wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe reid life dinnling and stending in their members; and this was a\nmuckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa\u00e2\u0080\u0099n in the vale o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 years.  Say what ye\nlike, I maun say what I believe.  It was joy was in the creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart,\nthe joy o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hell, I daursay: joy whatever.  Mony a time I have askit\nmysel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are their\nmaist dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wives or auld,\nfeckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik dancing a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the\nhours by his lane in the black glory of his heart.  Nae doubt they burn\nfor it muckle in hell, but they have a grand time here of it,\nwhatever!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the Lord forgie us!\n\nWeel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-heid\nupon the harbour rocks.  That was a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Sandie waited for.  He up wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the\ngun, took a deleeberate aim, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pu\u00e2\u0080\u0099d the trigger.  There cam\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a bang and\nthen ae waefu\u00e2\u0080\u0099 skirl frae the Bass.  And there were we rubbin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 our een\nand lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at ither like daft folk.  For wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the bang and the skirl the\nthing had clean disappeared.  The sun glintit, the wund blew, and there\nwas the bare yaird whaur the Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae\nsecond syne.\n\nThe hale way hame I roared and grat wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the terror o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that dispensation.\nThe grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there was little said in\nSandie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat but just the name of God; and when we won in by the pier,\nthe harbour rocks were fair black wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the folk waitin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 us.  It seems they\nhad fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing the shuttle and smiling.  Ae\nlad they sent to hoist the flag, and the rest abode there in the\nwabster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.  You may be sure they liked it little; but it was a\nmeans of grace to severals that stood there praying in to themsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (for\nnane cared to pray out loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it\ncawed the shuttle.  Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the ae dreidfu\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nskelloch, Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab,\na bluidy corp.\n\nWhen the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the\nwarlock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but there was\ngrandfaither\u00e2\u0080\u0099s siller tester in the puddock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart of him.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nAndie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had\nits consequence.  Neil, as I have said, was himself a great narrator.  I\nhave heard since that he knew all the stories in the Highlands; and\nthought much of himself, and was thought much of by others on the\nstrength of it.  Now Andie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tale reminded him of one he had already\nheard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe would ken that story afore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was the story of Uistean\nMore M\u00e2\u0080\u0099Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is no sic a thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Andie.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the story of my faither (now\nwi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 God) and Tod Lapraik.  And the same in your beard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nkeep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown in\nhistory, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the thing appears\nscarce feasible for Lowland commons.  I had already remarked that Andie\nwas continually on the point of quarrelling with our three MacGregors,\nand now, sure enough, it was to come.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThir will be no words to use to shentlemans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Neil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShentlemans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Andie.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShentlemans, ye hielant stot!  If God would\ngive ye the grace to see yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the way that ithers see ye, ye would\nthrow your denner up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black knife was\nin his hand that moment.\n\nThere was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the leg, and\nhad him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I knew what I was\ndoing.  His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie and I were without\nweapons, the Gregara three to two.  It seemed we were beyond salvation,\nwhen Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering the others back, and made\nhis submission to myself in a manner the most abject, even giving me up\nhis knife which (upon a repetition of his promises) I returned to him on\nthe morrow.\n\nTwo things I saw plain: the first, that I must not build too high on\nAndie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there, as pale as death,\ntill the affair was over; the second, the strength of my own position\nwith the Highlanders, who must have received extraordinary charges to be\ntender of my safety.  But if I thought Andie came not very well out in\ncourage, I had no fault to find with him upon the account of gratitude.\nIt was not so much that he troubled me with thanks, as that his whole\nmind and manner appeared changed; and as he preserved ever after a great\ntimidity of our companions, he and I were yet more constantly together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE MISSING WITNESS\n\n\nOn the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I had much\nrebellion against fate.  The thought of him waiting in the _King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arms_,\nand of what he would think, and what he would say when next we met,\ntormented and oppressed me. The truth was unbelievable, so much I had to\ngrant, and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and a\ncoward, and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that I\nshould do.  I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish,\nand re-examined in that light the steps of my behaviour.  It seemed I had\nbehaved to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past was a picture\nthat I could be proud of, and there was only the present to consider.  I\ncould not swim the sea, nor yet fly in the air, but there was always\nAndie.  I had done him a service, he liked me; I had a lever there to\nwork on; if it were just for decency, I must try once more with Andie.\n\nIt was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the Bass but the lap and\nbubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions were all crept apart,\nthe three Macgregors higher on the rock, and Andie with his Bible to a\nsunny place among the ruins; there I found him in deep sleep, and, as\nsoon as he was awake, appealed to him with some fervour of manner and a\ngood show of argument.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, staring at me\nover his spectacles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to save another,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand to redeem my word.  What would be\nmore good than that?  Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie?  And you with\nthe Book upon your lap!  _What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole\nworld_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grand for you.  But where do I come in!  I have my\nword to redeem the same\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yoursel\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  And what are ye asking me to do, but\njust to sell it ye for siller?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAndie! have I named the name of siller?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOu, the name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naething\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe thing is there, whatever.  It\njust comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you propose, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nlose my lifelihood.  Then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to make it up to me, and\na pickle mair, for your ain credit like.  And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that but just a\nbribe?  And if even I was certain of the bribe!  But by a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that I can\nlearn, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far frae that; and if _you_ were to hang, where would _I_ be?\nNa: the thing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no possible.  And just awa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ye like a bonny lad! and\nlet Andie read his chapter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result; and\nthe next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of gratitude to\nPrestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent, illegal manner, out of\nthe midst of my dangers, temptations, and perplexities.  But this was\nboth too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long, and the remembrance of\nJames began to succeed to the possession of my spirits.  The 21st, the\nday set for the trial, I passed in such misery of mind as I can scarce\nrecall to have endured, save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only.  Much of the\ntime I lay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body motionless,\nmy mind full of violent thoughts.  Sometimes I slept indeed; but the\ncourt-house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find\nhis missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake again with\na start to darkness of spirit and distress of body.  I thought Andie\nseemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed.  Verily, my bread was\nbitter to me, and my days a burthen.\n\nEarly the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions, and\nAndie placed a packet in my hand.  The cover was without address but\nsealed with a Government seal.  It enclosed two notes.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Balfour can\nnow see for himself it is too late to meddle.  His conduct will be\nobserved and his discretion rewarded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So ran the first, which seemed to\nbe laboriously writ with the left hand.  There was certainly nothing in\nthese expressions to compromise the writer, even if that person could be\nfound; the seal, which formidably served instead of signature, was\naffixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of writing; and\nI had to confess that (so far) my adversaries knew what they were doing,\nand to digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the\npromise.\n\nBut the second enclosure was by far the more surprising.  It was in a\nlady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand of writ.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed a friend was\nspeiring for him and her eyes were of the grey_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it ran\u00e2\u0080\u0094and seemed so\nextraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under\ncover of a Government seal, that I stood stupid.  Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grey eyes\nshone in my remembrance.  I thought, with a bound of pleasure, she must\nbe the friend.  But who should the writer be, to have her billet thus\nenclosed with Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?  And of all wonders, why was it thought\nneedful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequent intelligence upon\nthe Bass?  For the writer, I could hit upon none possible except Miss\nGrant.  Her family, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and\neven named her for their colour; and she herself had been much in the\nhabit to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff, I\nsupposed, at my rusticity.  No doubt, besides, but she lived in the same\nhouse as this letter came from.  So there remained but one step to be\naccounted for; and that was how Prestongrange should have permitted her\nat all in an affair so secret, or let her daft-like billet go in the same\ncover with his own.  But even here I had a glimmering.  For, first of\nall, there was something rather alarming about the young lady, and papa\nmight be more under her domination than I knew.  And, second, there was\nthe man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continual policy to be remembered, how his conduct had been\ncontinually mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in the midst\nof so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship.  He must conceive\nthat my imprisonment had incensed me.  Perhaps this little jesting,\nfriendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?\n\nI will be honest\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I think it did.  I felt a sudden warmth towards that\nbeautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest in my\naffairs.  The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and\nmore cowardly counsels.  If the Advocate knew of her and our\nacquaintance\u00e2\u0080\u0094if I should please him by some of that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscretion\u00e2\u0080\u009d at which\nhis letter pointed\u00e2\u0080\u0094to what might not this lead!  _In vain is the net\nprepared in the sight of any fowl_, the Scripture says.  Well, fowls must\nbe wiser than folk!  For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell\nin with it.\n\nI was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before me like\ntwo stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see ye has gotten guid news,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nI found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came before me\nlike a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary; and my mind\nturned at once like a door upon its hinges.  Trials, I reflected,\nsometimes draw out longer than is looked for.  Even if I came to Inverary\njust too late, something might yet be attempted in the interests of\nJames\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in those of my own character, the best would be accomplished.\nIn a moment, it seemed without thought, I had a plan devised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAndie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it still to be to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe told me nothing was changed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas anything said about the hour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\nHe told me it was to be two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock afternoon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd about the place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pursued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatten place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe place I am to be landed at?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe owned there was nothing as to that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis shall be mine to arrange.  The wind is\nin the east, my road lies westward: keep your boat, I hire it; let us\nwork up the Forth all day; and land me at two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock to-morrow at the\nwestmost we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can have reached.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe daft callant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye would try for Inverary after a\u00e2\u0080\u0099!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust that, Andie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeel, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ill to beat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I was a kind o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sorry for ye a\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nday yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see, I was never entirely sure till then,\nwhich way of it ye really wantit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere was a spur to a lame horse!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA word in your ear, Andie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis plan of mine has another\nadvantage yet.  We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the rock, and\none of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to-morrow.  Yon\nNeil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe, if I was once out of the\ngate there might be knives again; these red-shanks are unco grudgeful.\nAnd if there should come to be any question, here is your excuse.  Our\nlives were in danger by these savages; being answerable for my safety,\nyou chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the\nrest of the time on board your boat: and do you know, Andie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I,\nwith a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it was very wisely chosen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe truth is I have nae goo for Neil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor he for me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nthinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the man.  Tam\nAnster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  (For this\nman, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still spoken.)  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\nay!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Andie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTam\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can deal with them the best.  And troth! the\nmair I think of it, the less I see we would be required.  The place\u00e2\u0080\u0094ay,\nfeggs! they had forgot the place.  Eh, Shaws, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a lang-heided chield\nwhen ye like!  Forby that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m awing ye my life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with more\nsolemnity, and offered me his hand upon the bargain.\n\nWhereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board the boat,\ncast off, and set the lug.  The Gregara were then busy upon breakfast,\nfor the cookery was their usual part; but, one of them stepping to the\nbattlements, our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from\nthe rock; and the three of them ran about the ruins and the\nlanding-shelf, for all the world like ants about a broken nest, hailing\nand crying on us to return.  We were still in both the lee and the shadow\nof the rock, which last lay broad upon the waters, but presently came\nforth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine; the sail\nfilled, the boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept immediately beyond\nsound of the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voices.  To what terrors they endured upon the rock,\nwhere they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised\nperson or so much as the protection of a Bible, no limit can be set; nor\nhad they any brandy left to be their consolation, for even in the haste\nand secrecy of our departure Andie had managed to remove it.\n\nIt was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy\nRocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the\nnext day.  Thence we kept away up Firth.  The breeze, which was then so\nspirited, swiftly declined, but never wholly failed us.  All day we kept\nmoving, though often not much more; and it was after dark ere we were up\nwith the Queensferry.  To keep the letter of Andie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engagement (or what\nwas left of it) I must remain on board, but I thought no harm to\ncommunicate with the shore in writing.  On Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cover, where\nthe Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I\nwrit, by the boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie\ncarried them to Rankeillor.  In about an hour he came again, with a purse\nof money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled\nfor me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool.  This done, and the boat\nriding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep under the sail.\n\nWe were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was nothing left\nfor me but to sit and wait.  I felt little alacrity upon my errand.  I\nwould have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down; but none\nbeing to be found, my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been\nrunning to some desired pleasure.  By shortly after one the horse was at\nthe waterside, and I could see a man walking it to and fro till I should\nland, which vastly swelled my impatience.  Andie ran the moment of my\nliberation very fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce\nserving his employers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty seconds\nafter two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling.  In a\nlittle more than an hour I had passed that town, and was already mounting\nAlan Water side, when the weather broke in a small tempest.  The rain\nblinded me, the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle, and the first\ndarkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of\nBalwhidder, not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that\nbegan already to be weary.\n\nIn the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a\nguide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any horseman) the\nline of my journey with Alan.  This I did with open eyes, foreseeing a\ngreat risk in it, which the tempest had now brought to a reality.  The\nlast that I knew of where I was, I think it must have been about Uam Var;\nthe hour perhaps six at night.  I must still think it great good fortune\nthat I got about eleven to my destination, the house of Duncan Dhu.\nWhere I had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell.  I\nknow we were twice down, and once over the saddle and for a moment\ncarried away in a roaring burn.  Steed and rider were bemired up to the\neyes.\n\nFrom Duncan I had news of the trial.  It was followed in all these\nHighland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from Inverary\nas swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn that, up to a\nlate hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded; and all men began to\nsuppose it must spread over the Monday.  Under the spur of this\nintelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan having agreed to be my\nguide, took the road again on foot, with the piece in my hand and\nmunching as I went.  Duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a\nhand-lantern; which last enlightened us just so long as we could find\nhouses where to rekindle it, for the thing leaked outrageously and blew\nout with every gust.  The more part of the night we walked blindfold\namong sheets of rain, and day found us aimless on the mountains.  Hard by\nwe struck a hut on a burn-side, where we got bite and a direction; and, a\nlittle before the end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors of Inverary.\n\nThe rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was still\nbogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I could\nhardly limp, and my face was like a ghost\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  I stood certainly more in\nneed of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on, than of all the benefits\nin Christianity.  For all which (being persuaded the chief point for me\nwas to make myself immediately public) I set the door of the church with\nthe dirty Duncan at my tails, and finding a vacant place sat down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself must be\nregarded as a means of grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister was saying, in the voice of\none delighting to pursue an argument.\n\nThe sermon was in English on account of the assize.  The judges were\npresent with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered in a corner\nby the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of\nlawyers.  The text was in Romans 5th and 13th\u00e2\u0080\u0094the minister a skilled\nhand; and the whole of that able churchful\u00e2\u0080\u0094from Argyle, and my Lords\nElchies and Kilkerran, down to the halbertmen that came in their\nattendance\u00e2\u0080\u0094was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention.\nThe minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed\nour entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the same; the rest\neither did not hear or would not hear or would not be heard; and I sat\namongst my friends and enemies unremarked.\n\nThe first that I singled out was Prestongrange.  He sat well forward,\nlike an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with relish, his\neyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to his mind.\nCharles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and looked harassed\nand pale.  As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a blot, and almost a\nscandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation, digging his hands\nin his pockets, shifting his legs, clearing his throat, and rolling up\nhis bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left, now with a\nyawn, now with a secret smile.  At times, too, he would take the Bible in\nfront of him, run it through, seem to read a bit, run it through again,\nand stop and yawn prodigiously: the whole as if for exercise.\n\nIn the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself.  He sat a\nsecond stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible, scrawled upon\nit with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered word to his next\nneighbour.  The note came to Prestongrange, who gave me but the one look;\nthence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine; thence again to Argyle,\nwhere he sat between the other two lords of session, and his Grace turned\nand fixed me with an arrogant eye.  The last of those interested in my\npresence was Charlie Stewart, and he too began to pencil and hand about\ndispatches, none of which I was able to trace to their destination in the\ncrowd.\n\nBut the passage of these notes had aroused notice; all who were in the\nsecret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering information\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nrest questions; and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by\nthe flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering.  His voice\nchanged, he plainly faltered, nor did he again recover the easy\nconviction and full tones of his delivery.  It would be a puzzle to him\ntill his dying day, why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four\nparts, should thus miscarry in the fifth.\n\nAs for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and a good deal\nanxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my\nsuccess.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE MEMORIAL\n\n\nThe last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth\nbefore Stewart had me by the arm.  We were the first to be forth of the\nchurch, and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe\nwithin the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be\nthronged with the home-going congregation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I yet in time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy and no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe case is over; the jury is enclosed, and will\nso kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow in the morning, the same\nas I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began.\nThe thing has been public from the start.  The panel kent it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ye may do\nwhat ye will for me_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispers he two days ago.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Ye ken my fate by\nwhat the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr. Macintosh_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  O, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a\nscandal!\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe great Agyle he gaed before,\n    He gart the cannons and guns to roar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nand the very macer cried \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cruachan!\u00e2\u0080\u0099  But now that I have got you again\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never despair.  The oak shall go over the myrtle yet; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ding the\nCampbells yet in their own town.  Praise God that I should see the day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails upon the floor that\nI might have a change of clothes, and incommoded me with his assistance\nas I changed.  What remained to be done, or how I was to do it, was what\nhe never told me nor, I believe, so much as thought of.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ding the\nCampbells yet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was still his overcome.  And it was forced home upon\nmy mind how this, that had the externals of a sober process of law, was\nin its essence a clan battle between savage clans.  I thought my friend\nthe Writer none of the least savage.  Who that had only seen him at a\ncounsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back before the Lord Ordinary or following a golf ball and\nlaying down his clubs on Bruntsfield links, could have recognised for the\nsame person this voluble and violent clansman?\n\nJames Stewart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counsel were four in number\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sheriffs Brown of Colstoun\nand Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh, and Mr. Stewart younger of Stewart\nHall.  These were covenanted to dine with the Writer after sermon, and I\nwas very obligingly included of the party.  No sooner the cloth lifted,\nand the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff Miller, than we\nfell to the subject in hand.  I made a short narration of my seizure and\ncaptivity, and was then examined and re-examined upon the circumstances\nof the murder.  It will be remembered this was the first time I had had\nmy say out, or the matter at all handled, among lawyers; and the\nconsequence was very dispiriting to the others and (I must own)\ndisappointing to myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo sum up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Colstoun, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou prove that Alan was on the spot; you\nhave heard him proffer menaces against Glenure; and though you assure us\nhe was not the man who fired, you leave a strong impression that he was\nin league with him, and consenting, perhaps immediately assisting, in the\nact.  You show him besides, at the risk of his own liberty, actively\nfurthering the criminal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape.  And the rest of your testimony (so far\nas the least material) depends on the bare word of Alan or of James, the\ntwo accused.  In short, you do not at all break, but only lengthen by one\npersonage, the chain that binds our client to the murderer; and I need\nscarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather\naggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling\nblock from the beginning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am of the same opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sheriff Miller.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we may all be\nvery much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable\nwitness out of our way.  And chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might\nbe obliged.  For you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my\nview) has very much the appearance of a fourth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAllow me, sirs!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interposed Stewart the Writer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is another view.\nHere we have a witness\u00e2\u0080\u0094never fash whether material or not\u00e2\u0080\u0094a witness in\nthis cause, kidnapped by that old, lawless, bandit crew of the Glengyle\nMacgregors, and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old\nruins on the Bass.  Move that and see what dirt you fling on the\nproceedings!  Sirs, this is a tale to make the world ring with!  It would\nbe strange, with such a grip as this, if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon\nfor my client.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd suppose we took up Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stewart\nHall.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown\nin our path, as that James should have been hanged before we had found a\ncourt to hear us.  This is a great scandal, but I suppose we have none of\nus forgot a greater still, I mean the matter of the Lady Grange.  The\nwoman was still in durance; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was\nhumanly possible; and how did he speed? He never got a warrant!  Well,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the same now; the same weapons will be used.  This is a scene,\ngentleman, of clan animosity.  The hatred of the name which I have the\nhonour to bear, rages in high quarters.  There is nothing here to be\nviewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and I sat for some\ntime in the midst of my learned counsel, almost deaved with their talk\nbut extremely little the wiser for its purport.  The Writer was led into\nsome hot expressions; Colstoun must take him up and set him right; the\nrest joined in on different sides, but all pretty noisy; the Duke of\nArgyle was beaten like a blanket; King George came in for a few digs in\nthe by-going and a great deal of rather elaborate defence; and there was\nonly one person that seemed to be forgotten, and that was James of the\nGlens.\n\nThrough all this Mr. Miller sat quiet.  He was a slip of an oldish\ngentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a smooth rich voice, with an\ninfinite effect of pawkiness, dealing out each word the way an actor\ndoes, to give the most expression possible; and even now, when he was\nsilent, and sat there with his wig laid aside, his glass in both hands,\nhis mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he seemed the mere picture of\na merry slyness.  It was plain he had a word to say, and waited for the\nfit occasion.\n\nIt came presently.  Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some\nexpression of their duty to their client.  His brother sheriff was\npleased, I suppose, with the transition.  He took the table in his\nconfidence with a gesture and a look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe interest of our client goes certainly before all, but the world does\nnot come to an end with James Stewart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Whereat he cocked his eye.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmight condescend, _exempli gratia_, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr. Thomas\nMiller, and a Mr. David Balfour.  Mr. David Balfour has a very good\nground of complaint, and I think, gentlemen\u00e2\u0080\u0094if his story was properly\nredd out\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think there would be a number of wigs on the green.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe whole table turned to him with a common movement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cProperly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story that could\nscarcely fail to have some consequence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole\nadministration of justice, from its highest officer downward, would be\ntotally discredited; and it looks to me as if they would need to be\nreplaced.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I need\nnot point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s would be a remarkable\nbonny cause to appear in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\nWell, there they all were started on another hare; Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause,\nand what kind of speeches could be there delivered, and what officials\ncould be thus turned out, and who would succeed to their positions.  I\nshall give but the two specimens.  It was proposed to approach Simon\nFraser, whose testimony, if it could be obtained, would prove certainly\nfatal to Argyle and to Prestongrange.  Miller highly approved of the\nattempt.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have here before us a dreeping roast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is\ncut-and-come-again for all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And methought all licked their lips.  The\nother was already near the end.  Stewart the Writer was out of the body\nwith delight, smelling vengeance on his chief enemy, the Duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, charging his glass, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is to Sheriff Miller.\nHis legal abilities are known to all.  His culinary, this bowl in front\nof us is here to speak for.  But when it comes to the poleetical!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094cries\nhe, and drains the glass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nthe gratified Miller.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA revolution, if you like, and I think I can\npromise you that historical writers shall date from Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cause.\nBut properly guided, Mr. Stewart, tenderly guided, it shall prove a\npeaceful revolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed, what care I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries\nStewart, smiting down his fist.\n\nIt will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this, though I\ncould scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old\nintriguers.  But it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows for\nthe advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the\nParliament House: and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity of\nmanner as I could assume.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now I\nwould like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions.  There is\none thing that has fallen rather on one aide, for instance: Will this\ncause do any good to our friend James of the Glens?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey seemed all a hair set back, and gave various answers, but concurring\npractically in one point, that James had now no hope but in the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmercy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo proceed, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill it do any good to Scotland?  We have a\nsaying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest.  I remember\nhearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child, which gave\noccasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous; and I always\nunderstood that we had rather lost than gained by that.  Then came the\nyear \u00e2\u0080\u0099Forty-five, which made Scotland to be talked of everywhere; but I\nnever heard it said we had anyway gained by the \u00e2\u0080\u0099Forty-five.  And now we\ncome to this cause of Mr. Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, as you call it.  Sheriff Miller\ntells us historical writers are to date from it, and I would not wonder.\nIt is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and\npublic reproach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling to, and\nmade haste to get on the same road.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cForcibly put, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nhe.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA weighty observe, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\npursued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this; but I doubt you\nwill scarce be able to pull down the house from under him, without his\nMajesty coming by a knock or two, one of which might easily prove fatal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI gave them a chance to answer, but none volunteered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf those for whom the case was to be profitable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSheriff\nMiller gave us the names of several, among the which he was good enough\nto mention mine.  I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise.  I\nbelieve I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to\nbe saved; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded, and I own I\nthink it would be a pity for a young man, with some idea of coming to the\nBar, to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent, factious\nfellow before he was yet twenty.  As for James, it seems\u00e2\u0080\u0094at this date of\nthe proceedings, with the sentence as good as pronounced\u00e2\u0080\u0094he has no hope\nbut in the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mercy.  May not his Majesty, then, be more pointedly\naddressed, the characters of these high officers sheltered from the\npublic, and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see they found my\nattitude on the affair unpalatable.  But Miller was ready at all events.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I may be allowed to put my young friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notion in more formal\nshape,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand him to propose that we should embody the\nfact of his sequestration, and perhaps some heads of the testimony he was\nprepared to offer, in a memorial to the Crown.  This plan has elements of\nsuccess.  It is as likely as any other (and perhaps likelier) to help our\nclient.  Perhaps his Majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain\ngratitude to all concerned in such a memorial, which might be construed\ninto an expression of a very delicate loyalty; and I think, in the\ndrafting of the same, this view might be brought forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for the former\nalternative was doubtless more after their inclination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPaper, then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pursued Miller; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think\nit might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present, as\nprocurators for the condemned man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can do none of us any harm, at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Colstoun, heaving another\nsigh, for he had seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten minutes.\n\nThereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically, to draft the\nmemorial\u00e2\u0080\u0094a process in the course of which they soon caught fire; and I\nhad no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional question.\nThe paper was very well expressed; beginning with a recitation of the\nfacts about myself, the reward offered for my apprehension, my surrender,\nthe pressure brought to bear upon me; my sequestration; and my arrival at\nInverary in time to be too late; going on to explain the reasons of\nloyalty and public interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of\naction; and winding up with a forcible appeal to the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mercy on\nbehalf of James.\n\nMethought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented in the\nlight of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had restrained\nwith difficulty from extremes.  But I let it pass, and made but the one\nsuggestion, that I should be described as ready to deliver my own\nevidence and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiry\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthe one demand, that I should be immediately furnished with a copy.\n\nColstoun hummed and hawed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a very confidential document,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview, so\nthat he has since stood my friend consistently.  But for him, gentlemen,\nI must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James.\nFor which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial\nas soon as it is copied.  You are to consider also that this step will\nmake for my protection.  I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard;\nhis Grace is in his own country, Lovat by his side; and if there should\nhang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well awake\nin gaol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNot finding any very ready answer to these considerations, my company of\nadvisers were at the last persuaded to consent, and made only this\ncondition that I was to lay the paper before Prestongrange with the\nexpress compliments of all concerned.\n\nThe Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace.  By the hand of one\nof Colstoun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servants I sent him a billet asking for an interview, and\nreceived a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the town.\nHere I found him alone in a chamber; from his face there was nothing to\nbe gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied some halberts\nin the hall, and not so stupid but what I could gather he was prepared to\narrest me there and then, should it appear advisable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, Mr. David, this is you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I would\nlike before I go further to express my sense of your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\noffices, even should they now cease.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard of your gratitude before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied drily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think\nthis can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to.  I\nwould remember also, if I were you, that you still stand on a very boggy\nfoundation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot now, my lord, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand if your lordship will but\nglance an eye along this, you will perhaps think as I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then turned back to one\npart and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect of.  His\nface a little lightened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is not so bad but what it might be worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough I am\nstill likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits seemed to mend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd to whom am I indebted for this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked presently.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOther\ncounsels must have been discussed, I think.  Who was it proposed this\nprivate method?  Was it Miller?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, it was myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese gentlemen have shown me no such\nconsideration, as that I should deny myself any credit I can fairly\nclaim, or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear.  And\nthe mere truth is, that they were all in favour of a process which should\nhave remarkable consequences in the Parliament House, and prove for them\n(in one of their own expressions) a dripping roast.  Before I intervened,\nI think they were on the point of sharing out the different law\nappointments.  Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some\ncomposition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPrestongrange smiled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are our friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what were\nyour reasons for dissenting, Mr. David?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told them without concealment, expressing, however, with more force and\nvolume those which regarded Prestongrange himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do me no more than justice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have fought as hard in\nyour interest as you have fought against mine.  And how came you here\nto-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the case drew out, I began to grow uneasy that I\nhad clipped the period so fine, and I was even expecting you to-morrow.\nBut to-day\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never dreamed of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was not of course, going to betray Andie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer\nof the Bass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And I gave him the\nenclosure in the counterfeit hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was the cover also with the seal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have it not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt bore not even an address, and could not\ncompromise a cat.  The second enclosure I have, and with your permission,\nI desire to keep it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the point.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour business here is to be finished, and I\nproceed by Glasgow.  I would be very glad to have you of my party, Mr\nDavid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not deny it will be of service to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI desire\neven that, when we shall come to Edinburgh, you should alight at my\nhouse.  You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants, who will be\noverjoyed to have you to themselves.  If you think I have been of use to\nyou, you can thus easily repay me, and so far from losing, may reap some\nadvantage by the way.  It is not every strange young man who is presented\nin society by the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advocate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOften enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman had caused\nmy head to spin; no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now.\nHere was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with\nhis daughters, one of whom had been so good as to laugh at me, while the\nother two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence.  And now\nI was to ride with my lord to Glasgow; I was to dwell with him in\nEdinburgh; I was to be brought into society under his protection!  That\nhe should have so much good-nature as to forgive me was surprising\nenough; that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible;\nand I began to seek some ulterior meaning.  One was plain.  If I became\nhis guest, repentance was excluded; I could never think better of my\npresent design and bring any action.  And besides, would not my presence\nin his house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial?  For that\ncomplaint could not be very seriously regarded, if the person chiefly\ninjured was the guest of the official most incriminated.  As I thought\nupon this I could not quite refrain from smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are cunning, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you do not wholly guess wrong\nthe fact will be of use to me in my defence.  Perhaps, however, you\nunderrate friendly sentiments, which are perfectly genuine.  I have a\nrespect for you, David, mingled with awe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my design to be called to the Bar, where your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncountenance would be invaluable; and I am besides sincerely grateful to\nyourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence.\nThe difficulty is here.  There is one point in which we pull two ways.\nYou are trying to hang James Stewart, I am trying to save him.  In so far\nas my riding with you would better your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defence, I am at your\nlordships orders; but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart,\nyou see me at a stick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought he swore to himself.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should certainly be called; the Bar\nis the true scene for your talents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, bitterly, and then fell a\nwhile silent.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he presently resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no\nquestion of James Stewart, for or against, James is a dead man; his life\nis given and taken\u00e2\u0080\u0094bought (if you like it better) and sold; no memorial\ncan help\u00e2\u0080\u0094no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David hurt him.  Blow high,\nblow low, there will be no pardon for James Stewart: and take that for\nsaid!  The question is now of myself: am I to stand or fall? and I do not\ndeny to you that I am in some danger.  But will Mr. David Balfour\nconsider why?  It is not because I pushed the case unduly against James;\nfor that, I am sure of condonation.  And it is not because I have\nsequestered Mr. David on a rock, though it will pass under that colour;\nbut because I did not take the ready and plain path, to which I was\npressed repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or to the gallows.\nHence the scandal\u00e2\u0080\u0094hence this damned memorial,\u00e2\u0080\u009d striking the paper on his\nleg.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty.  I wish\nto know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you\nhelp me out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said; if James was\npast helping, whom was it more natural that I should turn to help than\njust the man before me, who had helped myself so often, and was even now\nsetting me a pattern of patience?  I was besides not only weary, but\nbeginning to be ashamed, of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and\nrefusal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will name the time and place, I will be punctually ready to\nattend your lordship,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nHe shook hands with me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think my misses have some news for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, dismissing me.\n\nI came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made, yet a little concerned\nin conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went back, whether,\nperhaps, I had not been a scruple too good-natured.  But there was the\nfact, that this was a man that might have been my father, an able man, a\ngreat dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had reached a hand\nto my assistance.  I was in the better humour to enjoy the remainder of\nthat evening, which I passed with the advocates, in excellent company no\ndoubt, but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch: for\nthough I went early to bed I have no clear mind of how I got there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE TEE\u00e2\u0080\u0099D BALL\n\n\nOn the morrow, from the justices\u00e2\u0080\u0099 private room, where none could see me,\nI heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon James.  The\nDuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words I am quite sure I have correctly; and since that famous\npassage has been made a subject of dispute, I may as well commemorate my\nversion.  Having referred to the year \u00e2\u0080\u009945, the chief of the Campbells,\nsitting as Justice-General upon the bench, thus addressed the unfortunate\nStewart before him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you had been successful in that rebellion, you\nmight have been giving the law where you have now received the judgment\nof it; we, who are this day your judges, might have been tried before one\nof your mock courts of judicature; and then you might have been satiated\nwith the blood of any name or clan to which you had an aversion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought I.  And that was\nthe general impression.  It was extraordinary how the young advocate lads\ntook hold and made a mock of this speech, and how scarce a meal passed\nbut what someone would get in the words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then you might have been\nsatiated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Many songs were made in time for the hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diversion, and\nare near all forgot.  I remember one began:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?\n    Is it a name, or is it a clan,\n    Or is it an aefauld Hielandman,\n    That ye want the bluid of, bluid of?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother went to my old favourite air, _The House of Airlie_, and began\nthus:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,\n    That they served him a Stewart for his denner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd one of the verses ran:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen up and spak\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the Duke, and flyted on his cook,\n    I regard it as a sensible aspersion,\n    That I would sup ava\u00e2\u0080\u0099, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 satiate my maw,\n    With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJames was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-piece\nand stalked him.  So much of course I knew: but others knew not so much,\nand were more affected by the items of scandal that came to light in the\nprogress of the cause.  One of the chief was certainly this sally of the\njustice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  It was run hard by another of a juryman, who had struck into\nthe midst of Coulston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech for the defence with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, sir, cut it\nshort, we are quite weary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which seemed the very excess of impudence and\nsimplicity.  But some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered\nwith an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings.\nOne witness was never called.  His name, indeed, was printed, where it\nmay still be seen on the fourth page of the list: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJames Drummond,\n_alias_ Macgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in Inveronachile\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and\nhis precognition had been taken, as the manner is, in writing.  He had\nremembered or invented (God help him) matter which was lead in James\nStewart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoes, and I saw was like to prove wings to his own.  This\ntestimony it was highly desirable to bring to the notice of the jury,\nwithout exposing the man himself to the perils of cross-examination; and\nthe way it was brought about was a matter of surprise to all.  For the\npaper was handed round (like a curiosity) in court; passed through the\njury-box, where it did its work; and disappeared again (as though by\naccident) before it reached the counsel for the prisoner.  This was\ncounted a most insidious device; and that the name of James More should\nbe mingled up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and concern for\nmyself.\n\nThe following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable company, set\nout for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued to linger some\ntime in a mixture of pleasure and affairs.  I lodged with my lord, with\nwhom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my place at entertainments; was\npresented to the chief guests; and altogether made more of than I thought\naccorded either with my parts or station; so that, on strangers being\npresent, I would often blush for Prestongrange.  It must be owned the\nview I had taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a\ngloom upon my character.  I had met many men, some of them leaders in\nIsrael whether by their birth or talents; and who among them all had\nshown clean hands?  As for the Browns and Millers, I had seen their\nself-seeking, I could never again respect them.  Prestongrange was the\nbest yet; he had saved me, spared me rather, when others had it in their\nminds to murder me outright; but the blood of James lay at his door; and\nI thought his present dissimulation with myself a thing below pardon.\nThat he should affect to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised\nme out of my patience.  I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow\nfire of anger in my bowels.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, friend, friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I would think to\nmyself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you were but through with this affair of the memorial, would\nyou not kick me in the streets?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Here I did him, as events have proved,\nthe most grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more sincere,\nand a far more artful performer, than I supposed.\n\nBut I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that court\nof young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage.  The sudden\nfavour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at first out of\nmeasure; but two days were not gone by before I found myself surrounded\nwith flattery and attention.  I was the same young man, and neither\nbetter nor bonnier, that they had rejected a month before; and now there\nwas no civility too fine for me!  The same, do I say?  It was not so; and\nthe by-name by which I went behind my back confirmed it.  Seeing me so\nfirm with the Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly high and far,\nthey had taken a word from the golfing green, and called me _the Tee\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nBall_. {14}  I was told I was now \u00e2\u0080\u009cone of themselves\u00e2\u0080\u009d; I was to taste of\ntheir soft lining, who had already made my own experience of the\nroughness of the outer husk; and one, to whom I had been presented in\nHope Park, was so aspired as even to remind me of that meeting.  I told\nhim I had not the pleasure of remembering it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was Miss Grant herself presented me!  My name is\nso-and-so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may very well be, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have kept no mind of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly\noverflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure.\n\nBut I have not patience to dwell upon that time at length.  When I was in\ncompany with these young politics I was borne down with shame for myself\nand my own plain ways, and scorn for them and their duplicity.  Of the\ntwo evils, I thought Prestongrange to be the least; and while I was\nalways as stiff as buckram to the young bloods, I made rather a\ndissimulation of my hard feelings towards the Advocate, and was (in old\nMr. Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word) \u00e2\u0080\u009csoople to the laird.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Himself commented on the\ndifference, and bid me be more of my age, and make friends with my young\ncomrades.\n\nI told him I was slow of making friends.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take the word back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is such a thing as\n_Fair gude s\u00e2\u0080\u0099en and fair gude day_, Mr. David.  These are the same young\nmen with whom you are to pass your days and get through life: your\nbackwardness has a look of arrogance; and unless you can assume a little\nmore lightness of manner, I fear you will meet difficulties in the path.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nOn the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering in of an\nexpress; and getting to my window almost before he had dismounted, I saw\nthe messenger had ridden hard.  Somewhile after I was called to\nPrestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap, with his\nletters round him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d add he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a piece of news for you.  It concerns some\nfriends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little ashamed, for\nyou have never referred to their existence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI suppose I blushed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee you understand, since you make the answering signal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nI must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty.  But do you\nknow, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising lass.  She crops up\nfrom every side.  The Government of Scotland appears unable to proceed\nfor Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat the case (no great\nwhile back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour.  Should not these make a\ngood match?  Her first intromission in politics\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I must not tell you\nthat story, the authorities have decided you are to hear it otherwise and\nfrom a livelier narrator.  This new example is more serious, however; and\nI am afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in\nprison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI cried out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe little lady is in prison.  But I would not have you\nto despair.  Unless you (with your friends and memorials) shall procure\nmy downfall, she is to suffer nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what has she done?  What is her offence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt might be almost construed a high treason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he returned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor she has\nbroke the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Castle of Edinburgh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lady is much my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you would not mock me if\nthe thing were serious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet it is serious in a sense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor this rogue of a\nKatrine\u00e2\u0080\u0094or Cateran, as we may call her\u00e2\u0080\u0094has set adrift again upon the\nworld that very doubtful character, her papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHere was one of my previsions justified: James More was once again at\nliberty.  He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he had volunteered\nhis testimony in the Appin case, and the same (no matter by what\nsubterfuge) had been employed to influence the jury.  Now came his\nreward, and he was free.  It might please the authorities to give to it\nthe colour of an escape; but I knew better\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew it must be the\nfulfilment of a bargain.  The same course of thought relieved me of the\nleast alarm for Catriona.  She might be thought to have broke prison for\nher father; she might have believed so herself.  But the chief hand in\nthe whole business was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from\nletting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to be even tried.\nWhereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I was expecting that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have at times a great deal of discretion, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Prestongrange.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is my lord pleased to mean by that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just marvelling\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat being so clever as to draw\nthese inferences, you should not be clever enough to keep them to\nyourself.  But I think you would like to hear the details of the affair.\nI have received two versions: and the least official is the more full and\nfar the more entertaining, being from the lively pen of my eldest\ndaughter.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nwrites, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and what would make the thing more noted (if it were only known)\nthe malefactor is a _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ of his lordship my papa.  I am sure your\nheart is too much in your duty (if it were nothing else) to have\nforgotten Grey Eyes.  What does she do, but get a broad hat with the\nflaps open, a long hairy-like man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatcoat, and a big gravatt; kilt\nher coats up to _Gude kens whaur_, clap two pair of boot-hose upon her\nlegs, take a pair of _clouted brogues_ {15} in her hand, and off to the\nCastle!  Here she gives herself out to be a soutar {16} in the employ of\nJames More, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant (who seems to\nhave been full of pleasantry) making sport among his soldiers of the\nsoutar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatcoat.  Presently they hear disputation and the sound of\nblows inside.  Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the flaps of his\nhat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his soldiers mock at him\nas he runs off.  They laughed no so hearty the next time they had\noccasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall, pretty, grey-eyed\nlass in the female habit!  As for the cobbler, he was \u00e2\u0080\u0098over the hills\nayout Dumblane,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thought that poor Scotland will have to console\nherself without him.  I drank Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health this night in public.\nIndeed, the whole town admires her; and I think the beaux would wear bits\nof her garters in their button-holes if they could only get them.  I\nwould have gone to visit her in prison too, only I remembered in time I\nwas papa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter; so I wrote her a billet instead, which I entrusted\nto the faithful Doig, and I hope you will admit I can be political when I\nplease.  The same faithful gomeral is to despatch this letter by the\nexpress along with those of the wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool\nin company with Solomon.  Talking of _gomerals_, do tell _Dauvit\nBalfour_.  I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a\nlong-legged lass in such a predicament; to say nothing of the levities of\nyour affectionate daughter, and his respectful friend.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  So my rascal\nsigns herself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Prestongrange.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you see, Mr. David, it is\nquite true what I tell you, that my daughters regard you with the most\naffectionate playfulness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gomeral is much obliged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd was not this prettily done!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not this Highland maid\na piece of a heroine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was always sure she had a great heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I wager she\nguessed nothing . . . But I beg your pardon, this is to tread upon\nforbidden subjects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go bail she did not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he returned, quite openly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go bail\nshe thought she was flying straight into King George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRemembrance of Catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity, moved\nme strangely.  I could see that even Prestongrange admired, and could not\nwithhold his lips from smiling when he considered her behaviour.  As for\nMiss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery, her admiration shone out\nplain.  A kind of a heat came on me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. . . \u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I know of!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he put in, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI speak like a fool,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cor rather I began wrong.  It would\ndoubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison; but for me,\nI think I would look like a half-hearted friend if I did not fly there\ninstantly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo-ho, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought that you and I were in a\nbargain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I made that bargain I was a good deal affected\nby your goodness, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never can deny that I was moved besides by my\nown interest.  There was self-seeking in my heart, and I think shame of\nit now.  It may be for your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety to say this fashious Davie\nBalfour is your friend and housemate.  Say it then; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never contradict\nyou.  But as for your patronage, I give it all back.  I ask but the one\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0094let me go, and give me a pass to see her in her prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at me with a hard eye.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou put the cart before the horse, I\nthink,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat which I had given was a portion of my liking,\nwhich your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked.  But for my\npatronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact) is it yet offered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He\npaused a bit.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I warn you, you do not know yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYouth is a hasty season; you will think better of all this before a\nyear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I would like to be that kind of youth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen\ntoo much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your\nlordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me.  And I have seen it in\nthe old ones also.  They are all for by-ends, the whole clan of them!\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liking.  Why\nwould I think that you would like me?  But ye told me yourself ye had an\ninterest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing me\nwith an unfathomable face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy lord, I ask your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I resumed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have nothing in my chafts\nbut a rough country tongue.  I think it would be only decent-like if I\nwould go to see my friend in her captivity; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m owing you my\nlife\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never forget that; and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good, here\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barely gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis might have been reached in fewer words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Prestongrange grimly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain Scots \u00e2\u0080\u0098ay\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor\n_your_ sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness that ye say ye bear to\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094for these, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consent; but not for any good that might be coming to\nmyself.  If I stand aside when this young maid is in her trial, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nthing I will be noways advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never\ngain.  I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that\nfoundation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was a minute serious, then smiled.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mind me of the man with the\nlong nose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas you to see the moon by a telescope you would\nsee David Balfour there!  But you shall have your way of it.  I will ask\nat you one service, and then set you free: My clerks are overdriven; be\nso good as copy me these few pages, and when that is done, I shall bid\nyou God speed!  I would never charge myself with Mr. David\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conscience;\nand if you could cast some part of it (as you went by) in a moss hag, you\nwould find yourself to ride much easier without it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nI.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you shall have the last word, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he gaily.\n\nIndeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means to gain\nhis purpose.  To lessen the weight of the memorial, or to have a readier\nanswer at his hand, he desired I should appear publicly in the character\nof his intimate.  But if I were to appear with the same publicity as a\nvisitor to Catriona in her prison the world would scarce stint to draw\nconclusions, and the true nature of James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape must become\nevident to all.  This was the little problem I had to set him of a\nsudden, and to which he had so briskly found an answer.  I was to be\ntethered in Glasgow by that job of copying, which in mere outward decency\nI could not well refuse; and during these hours of employment Catriona\nwas privately got rid of.  I think shame to write of this man that loaded\nme with so many goodnesses.  He was kind to me as any father, yet I ever\nthought him as false as a cracked bell.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\u00e2\u0080\u0094I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES\n\n\nThe copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived very early\nthere was no sort of urgency in the matters treated, and began very early\nto consider my employment a pretext.  I had no sooner finished than I got\nto horse, used what remained of daylight to the best purpose, and being\nat last fairly benighted, slept in a house by Almond-Water side.  I was\nin the saddle again before the day, and the Edinburgh booths were just\nopening when I clattered in by the West Bow and drew up a smoking horse\nat my lord Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door.  I had a written word for Doig, my lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nprivate hand that was thought to be in all his secrets\u00e2\u0080\u0094a worthy little\nplain man, all fat and snuff and self-sufficiency.  Him I found already\nat his desk and already bedabbled with maccabaw, in the same anteroom\nwhere I rencountered with James More.  He read the note scrupulously\nthrough like a chapter in his Bible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cH\u00e2\u0080\u0099m,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr. Balfour.  The bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nflaen\u00e2\u0080\u0094we hae letten her out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Drummond is set free?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAchy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would we keep her for, ye ken?  To hae made a\nsteer about the bairn would has pleased naebody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd where\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll she be now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGude kens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Doig, with a shrug.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gang there straight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be for a bite or ye go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeither bite nor sup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a good wauch of milk in by\nRatho.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAweel, aweel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Doig.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can leave your horse here and your\nbags, for it seems we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re to have your up-put.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNa, na\u00e2\u0080\u009d, said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTamson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mear {17} would never be the thing for me\nthis day of all days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDoig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation into an accent\nmuch more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a good deal\nbroader, indeed, than I have written it down; and I was the more ashamed\nwhen another voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a ballad:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cGae saddle me the bonny black,\n    Gae saddle sune and mak\u00e2\u0080\u0099 him ready\n    For I will down the Gatehope-slack,\n    And a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see my bonny leddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning gown, and her\nhands muffled in the same, as if to hold me at a distance.  Yet I could\nnot but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy best respects to you, Mistress Grant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, bowing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe like to yourself, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied with a deep courtesy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I beg to remind you of an old musty saw, that meat and mass never\nhindered man.  The mass I cannot afford you, for we are all good\nProtestants.  But the meat I press on your attention.  And I would not\nwonder but I could find something for your private ear that would be\nworth the stopping for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMistress Grant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe I am already your debtor for some\nmerry words\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I think they were kind too\u00e2\u0080\u0094on a piece of unsigned paper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnsigned paper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, and made a droll face, which was likewise\nwondrous beautiful, as of one trying to remember.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr else I am the more deceived,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut to be sure, we shall\nhave the time to speak of these, since your father is so good as to make\nme for a while your inmate; and the _gomeral_ begs you at this time only\nfor the favour of his liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou give yourself hard names,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nI.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce more I have to admire the discretion of all men-folk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will be back the\nsooner, for you go on a fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errand.  Off with you, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncontinued, opening the door.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has lowpen on his bonny grey,\n    He rade the richt gate and the ready\n    I trow he would neither stint nor stay,\n    For he was seeking his bonny leddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncitation on the way to Dean.\n\nOld Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden, in her hat and\nmutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of some black wood to lean upon.\nAs I alighted from my horse, and drew near to her with _congees_, I could\nsee the blood come in her face, and her head fling into the air like what\nI had conceived of empresses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat brings you to my poor door?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, speaking high through her\nnose.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot bar it.  The males of my house are dead and buried; I\nhave neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me; any beggar can\npluck me by the baird {18}\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a baird there is, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the worst of\nit yet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added partly to herself.\n\nI was extremely put out at this reception, and the last remark, which\nseemed like a daft wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, left me near hand speechless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I will\nstill be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed close together\ninto twenty creases, her hand shaking on her staff.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis cows all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe come to me to speir for her?  Would God I knew!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is not here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\nShe threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me, so that I fell\nback incontinent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut upon your leeing throat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! ye come and speir at\nme!  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in jyle, whaur ye took her to\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all there is to it.  And\nof a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the beings ever I beheld in breeks, to think it should be to you!\nYe timmer scoun\u00e2\u0080\u0099rel, if I had a male left to my name I would have your\njaicket dustit till ye raired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought it not good to delay longer in that place, because I remarked\nher passion to be rising.  As I turned to the horse-post she even\nfollowed me; and I make no shame to confess that I rode away with the one\nstirrup on and scrambling for the other.\n\nAs I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries, there was\nnothing left me but to return to the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  I was well received by\nthe four ladies, who were now in company together, and must give the news\nof Prestongrange and what word went in the west country, at the most\ninordinate length and with great weariness to myself; while all the time\nthat young lady, with whom I so much desired to be alone again, observed\nme quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience.\nAt last, after I had endured a meal with them, and was come very near the\npoint of appealing for an interview before her aunt, she went and stood\nby the music-case, and picking out a tune, sang to it on a high key\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nthat will not when he may, When he will he shall have nay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But this was\nthe end of her rigours, and presently, after making some excuse of which\nI have no mind, she carried me away in private to her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s library.\nI should not fail to say she was dressed to the nines, and appeared\nextraordinary handsome.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Mr. David, sit ye down here and let us have a two-handed crack,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor I have much to tell you, and it appears besides that I\nhave been grossly unjust to your good taste.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn what manner, Mistress Grant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI trust I have never seemed\nto fail in due respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be your surety, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour respect, whether to\nyourself or your poor neighbours, has been always and most fortunately\nbeyond imitation.  But that is by the question.  You got a note from me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was so bold as to suppose so upon inference,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it was\nkindly thought upon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have prodigiously surprised you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut let us begin\nwith the beginning.  You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so\nkind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park?  I have the\nless cause to forget it myself, because you was so particular obliging as\nto introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar, a thing\nwhich wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear I was sadly pedantical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, overcome with confusion at the\nmemory.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of\nladies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will say the less about the grammar then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how came\nyou to desert your charge?  \u00e2\u0080\u0098He has thrown her out, overboard, his ain\ndear Annie!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d she hummed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had\nto taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese!  It seems you\nreturned to my papa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, where you showed yourself excessively martial, and\nthen on to realms unknown, with an eye (it appears) to the Bass Rock;\nsolan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThrough all this raillery there was something indulgent in the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye\nwhich made me suppose there might be better coming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take a pleasure to torment me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I make a very feckless\nplaything; but let me ask you to be more merciful.  At this time there is\nbut the one thing that I care to hear of, and that will be news of\nCatriona.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn troth, and I am not very sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I stammered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not do so in any case to strangers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Grant.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why\nare you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard she was in prison,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and now you hear that she is out of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand what\nmore would you have?  She has no need of any further champion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI may have the greater need of her, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, this is better!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Miss Grant.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut look me fairly in the\nface; am I not bonnier than she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would be the last to be denying it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is not your\nmarrow in all Scotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, here you have the pick of the two at your hand, and must needs\nspeak of the other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is never the way to please the\nladies, Mr. Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, mistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are surely other things besides mere\nbeauty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be,\nperhaps?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the\nmidden in the fable book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see the braw jewel\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I like fine\nto see it too\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I have more need of the pickle corn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravissimo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a word well said at last, and I will\nreward you for it with my story.  That same night of your desertion I\ncame late from a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house\u00e2\u0080\u0094where I was excessively admired, whatever\nyou may think of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan\nscreen desired to speak with me?  She had been there an hour or better,\nsaid the servant-lass, and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting.  I\nwent to her direct; she rose as I came in, and I knew her at a look.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Grey Eyes_!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says I to myself, but was more wise than to let on.  _You\nwill be Miss Grant at last_? she says, rising and looking at me hard and\npitiful.  _Ay_, _it was true he said_, _you are bonny at all\nevents_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_The way God made me_, _my dear_, I said, _but I would be gey\nand obliged if you could tell me what brought you here at such a time of\nthe night_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Lady_, she said, _we are kinsfolk_, _we are both come of the\nblood of the sons of Alpin_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_My dear_, I replied, _I think no more of\nAlpin or his sons than what I do of a kalestock_.  _You have a better\nargument in these tears upon your bonny face_.  And at that I was so\nweak-minded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do dearly,\nand I wager will never find the courage of.  I say it was weak-minded of\nme, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it was the wisest\nstroke I could have hit upon.  She is a very staunch, brave nature, but I\nthink she has been little used with tenderness; and at that caress\n(though to say the truth, it was but lightly given) her heart went out to\nme.  I will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will never\ntell you the way she turned me round her thumb, because it is the same\nshe will use to twist yourself.  Ay, it is a fine lass!  She is as clean\nas hill well water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, she told me her concerns,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pursued Miss Grant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand in what\na swither she was in about her papa, and what a taking about yourself,\nwith very little cause, and in what a perplexity she had found herself\nafter you was gone away.  _And then I minded at long last_, says she,\n_that we were kinswomen_, _and that Mr. David should have given you the\nname of the bonniest of the bonny_, _and I was thinking to myself_ \u00e2\u0080\u0098_If\nshe is so bonny she will be good at all events_\u00e2\u0080\u0099; _and I took up my foot\nsoles out of that_.  That was when I forgave yourself, Mr. Davie.  When\nyou was in my society, you seemed upon hot iron: by all marks, if ever I\nsaw a young man that wanted to be gone, it was yourself, and I and my two\nsisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from; and now it\nappeared you had given me some notice in the by-going, and was so kind as\nto comment on my attractions!  From that hour you may date our\nfriendship, and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have many hours to rally me in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think besides\nyou do yourself injustice.  I think it was Catriona turned your heart in\nmy direction.  She is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of\nher friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe lasses\nhave clear eyes.  But at least she is your friend entirely, as I was to\nsee.  I carried her in to his lordship my papa; and his Advocacy being in\na favourable stage of claret, was so good as to receive the pair of us.\n_Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past_, said\nI, _she is come to prove that we spoke true_, _and I lay the prettiest\nlass in the three Lothians at your feet_\u00e2\u0080\u0094making a papistical reservation\nof myself.  She suited her action to my words: down she went upon her\nknees to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would not like to swear but he saw two of her, which\ndoubtless made her appeal the more irresistible, for you are all a pack\nof Mahomedans\u00e2\u0080\u0094told him what had passed that night, and how she had\nwithheld her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man from following of you, and what a case she was\nin about her father, and what a flutter for yourself; and begged with\nweeping for the lives of both of you (neither of which was in the\nslightest danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done\nso pretty, and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion.\nShe had not gone far, I assure you, before the Advocate was wholly sober,\nto see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to\nthe most unruly of his daughters.  But we took him in hand, the pair of\nus, and brought that matter straight.  Properly managed\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that means\nmanaged by me\u00e2\u0080\u0094there is no one to compare with my papa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has been a good man to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there to see to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she pled for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d say I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe did that, and very movingly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Grant.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not like to\ntell you what she said\u00e2\u0080\u0094I find you vain enough already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod reward her for it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do me too much injustice at the last!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would tremble to\nthink of her in such hard hands.  Do you think I would presume, because\nshe begged my life?  She would do that for a new whelped puppy!  I have\nhad more than that to set me up, if you but ken\u00e2\u0080\u0099d.  She kissed that hand\nof mine.  Ay, but she did.  And why? because she thought I was playing a\nbrave part and might be going to my death.  It was not for my sake\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I\nneed not be telling that to you, that cannot look at me without laughter.\nIt was for the love of what she thought was bravery.  I believe there is\nnone but me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour done them.  Was this\nnot to make a god of me? and do you not think my heart would quake when I\nremember it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more than is quite\ncivil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will tell you one thing: if you speak to her\nlike that, you have some glimmerings of a chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would never dare.  I can speak to you, Miss Grant,\nbecause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a matter of indifference what ye think of me.  But her? no\nfear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth they are no very small,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, looking down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, poor Catriona!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Miss Grant.\n\nAnd I could but stare upon her; for though I now see very well what she\nwas driving at (and perhaps some justification for the same), I was never\nswift at the uptake in such flimsy talk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh well, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit goes sore against my conscience, but\nI see I shall have to be your speaking board.  She shall know you came to\nher straight upon the news of her imprisonment; she shall know you would\nnot pause to eat; and of our conversation she shall hear just so much as\nI think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience.  Believe me,\nyou will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself,\nfor I will keep the big feet out of the platter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know where she is, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I exclaimed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a good friend, as you will soon discover; and the\nchief of those that I am friend to is my papa.  I assure you, you will\nnever heat nor melt me out of that, so you may spare me your sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\neyes; and adieu to your David-Balfourship for the now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there is yet one thing more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one thing that\nmust be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe brief; I have spent half the day on you already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Lady Allardyce believes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe supposes\u00e2\u0080\u0094she thinks that I\nabducted her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe colour came into Miss Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, so that at first I was quite\nabashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought me she was\nstruggling rather with mirth, a notion in which I was altogether\nconfirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take up the defence of your reputation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may\nleave it in my hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd with that she withdrew out of the library.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\u00e2\u0080\u0094I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY\n\n\nFor about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfamily, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar, and the\nflower of Edinburgh company.  You are not to suppose my education was\nneglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely busy.  I studied the\nFrench, so as to be more prepared to go to Leyden; I set myself to the\nfencing, and wrought hard, sometimes three hours in the day, with notable\nadvancement; at the suggestion of my cousin, Pilrig, who was an apt\nmusician, I was put to a singing class; and by the orders of my Miss\nGrant, to one for the dancing, at which I must say I proved far from\nornamental.  However, all were good enough to say it gave me an address a\nlittle more genteel; and there is no question but I learned to manage my\ncoat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in a room as\nthough the same belonged to me.  My clothes themselves were all earnestly\nre-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance, such as where I should\ntie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated among the three misses\nlike a thing of weight.  One way with another, no doubt I was a good deal\nimproved to look at, and acquired a bit of modest air that would have\nsurprised the good folks at Essendean.\n\nThe two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my\nhabiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts.  I\ncannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my presence; and\nthough always more than civil, with a kind of heartless cordiality, could\nnot hide how much I wearied them.  As for the aunt, she was a wonderful\nstill woman; and I think she gave me much the same attention as she gave\nthe rest of the family, which was little enough.  The eldest daughter and\nthe Advocate himself were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity\nwas much increased by a pleasure that we took in common.  Before the\ncourt met we spent a day or two at the house of Grange, living very nobly\nwith an open table, and here it was that we three began to ride out\ntogether in the fields, a practice afterwards maintained in Edinburgh, so\nfar as the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continual affairs permitted.  When we were put in a\ngood frame by the briskness of the exercise, the difficulties of the way,\nor the accidents of bad weather, my shyness wore entirely off; we forgot\nthat we were strangers, and speech not being required, it flowed the more\nnaturally on.  Then it was that they had my story from me, bit by bit,\nfrom the time that I left Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the\n_Covenant_, wanderings in the heather, etc.; and from the interest they\nfound in my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a\nlittle later on, on a day when the courts were not sitting, and of which\nI will tell a trifle more at length.\n\nWe took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws, where it\nstood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for it was yet early in\nthe day.  Here Prestongrange alighted down, gave me his horse, an\nproceeded alone to visit my uncle.  My heart, I remember, swelled up\nbitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of the\nold miser sitting chittering within in the cold kitchen!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is my home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand my family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor David Balfour!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Grant.\n\nWhat passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would doubtless\nnot be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate came forth again\nhis face was dark.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, turning\nhalf about with the one foot in the stirrup.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never pretend sorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; and, to say the truth, during his\nabsence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the place in fancy with\nplantations, parterres, and a terrace\u00e2\u0080\u0094much as I have since carried out in\nfact.\n\nThence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us a good\nwelcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great a visitor.\nHere the Advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go quite fully over my\naffairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in his study, and\nexpressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself and concern for my\nfortunes.  To while this time, Miss Grant and I and young Rankeillor took\nboat and passed the Hope to Limekilns.  Rankeillor made himself very\nridiculous (and, I thought, offensive) with his admiration for the young\nlady, and to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her sex) she\nseemed, if anything, to be a little gratified.  One use it had: for when\nwe were come to the other side, she laid her commands on him to mind the\nboat, while she and I passed a little further to the alehouse.  This was\nher own thought, for she had been taken with my account of Alison Hastie,\nand desired to see the lass herself.  We found her once more\nalone\u00e2\u0080\u0094indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the fields\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she\ncurtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the beautiful young lady in the\nriding-coat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this all the welcome I am to get?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, holding out my hand.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nhave you no more memory of old friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep me! wha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, and then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\ntautit {19} laddie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe am I to\nsee in your braws,\u00e2\u0080\u009d {20} she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I kent ye were come to your\nain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that I thank ye for\nwith a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my heart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Grant to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009crun out by with ye, like a guid bairn.\nI didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her and me that are\nto crack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came forth I\nobserved two things\u00e2\u0080\u0094that her eyes were reddened, and a silver brooch was\ngone out of her bosom.  This very much affected me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw you so well adorned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and was more than\nusually sharp to me the remainder of the day.\n\nAbout candlelight we came home from this excursion.\n\nFor a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0094my Miss Grant\nremaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with pleasantries.\nAt last, one day that she returned from walking and found me alone in the\nparlour over my French, I thought there was something unusual in her\nlooks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high, and a bit of a\nsmile continually bitten in as she regarded me.  She seemed indeed like\nthe very spirit of mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had soon\ninvolved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with\nnothing intended on my side.  I was like Christian in the slough\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more\nI tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved; until\nat last I heard her declare, with a great deal of passion, that she would\ntake that answer from the hands of none, and I must down upon my knees\nfor pardon.\n\nThe causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have said\nnothing you can properly object to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as for my knees, that\nis an attitude I keep for God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as a goddess I am to be served!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, shaking her brown locks\nat me and with a bright colour.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery man that comes within waft of my\npetticoats shall use me so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, although I\nvow I know not why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut for these play-acting postures, you\ncan go to others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO Davie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if I was to beg you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same as to say a\nchild, and that upon a point entirely formal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it a bairnly thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot worthy in you to ask, or me to\nrender.  Yet I will not refuse you, neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the stain, if\nthere be any, rests with yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And at that I kneeled fairly down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is the proper station, there is where I have\nbeen manoeuvring to bring you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And then, suddenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d {21} said\nshe, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment laughing.\n\nThe billet had neither place nor date.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nget your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a pleisand\nhearing.  I am very well, in a good place, among good folk, but\nnecessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping that at long last we\nmay meet again.  All your friendships have been told me by my loving\ncousin, who loves us both.  She bids me to send you this writing, and\noversees the same.  I will be asking you to do all her commands, and rest\nyour affectionate friend, Catriona Macgregor-Drummond.  P.S.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Will you not\nsee my cousin, Allardyce?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers say) that\nI should have done as I was here bidden and gone forthright to the house\nby Dean.  But the old lady was now entirely changed and supple as a\nglove.  By what means Miss Grant had brought this round I could never\nguess; I am sure, at least, she dared not to appear openly in the affair,\nfor her papa was compromised in it pretty deep.  It was he, indeed, who\nhad persuaded Catriona to leave, or rather, not to return, to her\ncousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, placing her instead with a family of Gregorys\u00e2\u0080\u0094decent people,\nquite at the Advocate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disposition, and in whom she might have the more\nconfidence because they were of his own clan and family.  These kept her\nprivate till all was ripe, heated and helped her to attempt her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrescue, and after she was discharged from prison received her again into\nthe same secrecy.  Thus Prestongrange obtained and used his instrument;\nnor did there leak out the smallest word of his acquaintance with the\ndaughter of James More.  There was some whispering, of course, upon the\nescape of that discredited person; but the Government replied by a show\nof rigour, one of the cell porters was flogged, the lieutenant of the\nguard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was broken of his rank, and as for\nCatriona, all men were well enough pleased that her fault should be\npassed by in silence.\n\nI could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would\nsay, when I persisted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going to keep the big feet out of the\nplatter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware she saw my\nlittle friend many times in the week, and carried her my news whenever\n(as she said) I \u00e2\u0080\u009chad behaved myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  At last she treated me to what she\ncalled an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter.  She was\ncertainly a strong, almost a violent, friend to all she liked, chief\namong whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman, very blind and very\nwitty, who dwelt on the top of a tall land on a strait close, with a nest\nof linnets in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors.  Miss Grant was\nvery fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend with the\nnarrative of my misfortunes: and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (that was her name)\nwas particular kind, and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge of\nold folks and past affairs in Scotland.  I should say that from her\nchamber window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness of that\nclose, it was possible to look into a barred loophole lighting the\nstairway of the opposite house.\n\nHere, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with Miss\nRamsay.  I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one preoccupied.\nI was besides very uncomfortable, for the window, contrary to custom, was\nleft open and the day was cold.  All at once the voice of Miss Grant\nsounded in my ears as from a distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, Shaws!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeek out of the window and see what I have\nbroughten you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld.  The well of the\nclose was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly, the walls\nvery black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole I saw two faces\nsmiling across at me\u00e2\u0080\u0094Miss Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Miss Grant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted her to see you in your braws like the\nlass of Limekilns.  I wanted her to see what I could make of you, when I\nbuckled to the job in earnest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt came in my mind that she had been more than common particular that day\nupon my dress; and I think that some of the same care had been bestowed\nupon Catriona.  For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was\ncertainly wonderful taken up with duds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all I could get out.\n\nAs for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her hand and\nsmiled to me, and was suddenly carried away again from before the\nloophole.\n\nThat vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door, where I\nfound I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying for the key,\nbut might as well have cried upon the castle rock.  She had passed her\nword, she said, and I must be a good lad.  It was impossible to burst the\ndoor, even if it had been mannerly; it was impossible I should leap from\nthe window, being seven storeys above ground.  All I could do was to\ncrane over the close and watch for their reappearance from the stair.  It\nwas little to see, being no more than the tops of their two heads each on\na ridiculous bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of pincushions.  Nor did\nCatriona so much as look up for a farewell; being prevented (as I heard\nafterwards) by Miss Grant, who told her folk were never seen to less\nadvantage than from above downward.\n\nOn the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss Grant with\nher cruelty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry you was disappointed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she demurely.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor my part I was\nvery pleased.  You looked better than I dreaded; you looked\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it will\nnot make you vain\u00e2\u0080\u0094a mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the\nwindow.  You are to remember that she could not see your feet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she,\nwith the manner of one reassuring me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave my feet be\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are no bigger than my neighbours\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are even smaller than some,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I speak in parables\nlike a Hebrew prophet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI marvel little they were sometimes stoned!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, you\nmiserable girl, how could you do it?  Why should you care to tantalise me\nwith a moment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLove is like folk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit needs some kind of vivers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d {22}\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Barbara, let me see her properly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I pleaded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ can\u00e2\u0080\u0094you see\nher when you please; let me have half an hour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is it that is managing this love affair!  You!  Or me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked,\nand as I continued to press her with my instances, fell back upon a\ndeadly expedient: that of imitating the tones of my voice when I called\non Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she held me in subjection for\nsome days to follow.\n\nThere was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none by me.\nPrestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have heard of it (for\nwhat I know) on the deafest sides of their heads; they kept it to\nthemselves, at least\u00e2\u0080\u0094the public was none the wiser; and in course of\ntime, on November 8th, and in the midst of a prodigious storm of wind and\nrain, poor James of the Glens was duly hanged at Lettermore by\nBallachulish.\n\nSo there was the final upshot of my politics!  Innocent men have perished\nbefore James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite of all our\nwisdom) till the end of time.  And till the end of time young folk (who\nare not yet used with the duplicity of life and men) will struggle as I\ndid, and make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and the course of\nevents will push them upon the one side and go on like a marching army.\nJames was hanged; and here was I dwelling in the house of Prestongrange,\nand grateful to him for his fatherly attention.  He was hanged; and\nbehold! when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my\nbeaver to him like a good little boy before his dominie.  He had been\nhanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and there was\nnot a pennyweight of difference; and the villains of that horrid plot\nwere decent, kind, respectable fathers of families, who went to kirk and\ntook the sacrament!\n\nBut I had had my view of that detestable business they call politics\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nhad seen it from behind, when it is all bones and blackness; and I was\ncured for life of any temptations to take part in it again.  A plain,\nquiet, private path was that which I was ambitious to walk in, when I\nmight keep my head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of the\nroad of temptation.  For, upon a retrospect, it appeared I had not done\nso grandly, after all; but with the greatest possible amount of big\nspeech and preparation, had accomplished nothing.\n\nThe 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from Leith; and\nI was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for Leyden.  To\nPrestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for I had already been a\nlong while sorning on his house and table.  But with his daughter I was\nmore open, bewailing my fate that I should be sent out of the country,\nand assuring her, unless she should bring me to farewell with Catriona, I\nwould refuse at the last hour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I not given you my advice?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I know how much I am beholden to you\nalready, and that I am bidden to obey your orders.  But you must confess\nyou are something too merry a lass at times to lippen {23} to entirely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe you on board by nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nforenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat alongside;\nand if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send them, you\ncan come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSince I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with this.\n\nThe day came round at last when she and I were to separate.  We had been\nextremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt; and what way we\nwere to part was a thing that put me from my sleep, like the vails I was\nto give to the domestic servants.  I knew she considered me too backward,\nand rather desired to rise in her opinion on that head.  Besides which,\nafter so much affection shown and (I believe) felt upon both sides, it\nwould have looked cold-like to be anyways stiff.  Accordingly, I got my\ncourage up and my words ready, and the last chance we were like to be\nalone, asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot call\nto mind that I have given you any right to presume on our acquaintancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to think, far\nless to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about my neck and kissed\nme with the best will in the world.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou inimitable bairn!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you think that I would let us\npart like strangers?  Because I can never keep my gravity at you five\nminutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you very well: I am all\nlove and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you!  And now I will give\nyou an advice to conclude your education, which you will have need of\nbefore it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very long.  Never _ask_ womenfolk.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bound to answer\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No\u00e2\u0080\u0099; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsupposed by divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it\nwhen the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing\nelse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is gallant, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she curtseying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would put the one question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMay I ask a lass to marry to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think you could not marry her without!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr else get her\nto offer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see you cannot be serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be very serious in one thing, David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall always\nbe your friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all at that\nsame window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and all cried\nfarewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away.  One out of the\nfour I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had\ncome to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow and\ngratitude made a confusion in my mind.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\u00e2\u0080\u0094FATHER AND DAUGHTER\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND\n\n\nThe ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so that\nall we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs.  This was very\nlittle troublesome, for the reason that the day was a flat calm, very\nfrosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water.  The body\nof the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars of\nher stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire.\nShe proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in\nthe bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and\nfine white linen stockings for the Dutch.  Upon my coming on board, the\ncaptain welcomed me\u00e2\u0080\u0094one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very\nhearty, friendly tarpaulin of a man, but at the moment in rather of a\nbustle.  There had no other of the passengers yet appeared, so that I was\nleft to walk about upon the deck, viewing the prospect and wondering a\ngood deal what these farewells should be which I was promised.\n\nAll Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me in a kind of\nsmuisty brightness, now and again overcome with blots of cloud; of Leith\nthere was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and on the face of\nthe water, where the haar {24} lay, nothing at all.  Out of this I was\npresently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out\nof the smoke of a fire) a boat issued.  There sat a grave man in the\nstern sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a tall, pretty,\ntender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand.  I had scarce\nthe time to catch my breath in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped\nupon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly\nfiner than some months before, when first I made it to her ladyship.  No\ndoubt we were both a good deal changed: she seemed to have shot up like a\nyoung, comely tree.  She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that\nbecame her well as of one that regarded herself more highly and was\nfairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same magician had\nbeen at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had made us both _braw_,\nif she could make but the one _bonny_.\n\nThe same cry, in words not very different, came from both of us, that the\nother was come in compliment to say farewell, and then we perceived in a\nflash we were to ship together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, why will not Baby have been telling me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried; and then\nremembered a letter she had been given, on the condition of not opening\nit till she was well on board.  Within was an enclosure for myself, and\nran thus:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cDEAR DAVIE,\u00e2\u0080\u0094What do you think of my farewell? and what do you say to\n    your fellow passenger?  Did you kiss, or did you ask?  I was about to\n    have signed here, but that would leave the purport of my question\n    doubtful, and in my own case _I ken the answer_.  So fill up here\n    with good advice.  Do not be too blate, {25} and for God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake do\n    not try to be too forward; nothing acts you worse.  I am\n\n                                  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour affectionate friend and governess,\n                                                          \u00e2\u0080\u009cBARBARA GRANT.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my pocketbook,\nput it in with another scratch from Catriona, sealed the whole with my\nnew signet of the Balfour arms, and despatched it by the hand of\nPrestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant that still waited in my boat.\n\nThen we had time to look upon each other more at leisure, which we had\nnot done for a piece of a minute before (upon a common impulse) we shook\nhands again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  It seemed that was the first and last word of my\neloquence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be glad to see me again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think that is an idle word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are too deep friends to\nmake speech upon such trifles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she not the girl of all the world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was never\nknowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a kale-stock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, she will say so indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Catriona.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYet it was for the name\nand the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I will tell you why it was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are all sorts of\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces in this world.  There is Barbara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, that everyone\nmust look at and admire, and think her a fine, brave, merry girl.  And\nthen there is your face, which is quite different\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never knew how\ndifferent till to-day.  You cannot see yourself, and that is why you do\nnot understand; but it was for the love of your face that she took you up\nand was so good to you.  And everybody in the world would do the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery living soul!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, then, that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBarbara has been teaching you to catch me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will have taught me more than that at all events.  She will have\ntaught me a great deal about Mr. David\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the ill of him, and a little\nthat was not so ill either, now and then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, smiling.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will\nhave told me all there was of Mr. David, only just that he would sail\nupon this very same ship.  And why it is you go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will be some days in company and then (I\nsuppose) good-bye for altogether!  I go to meet my father at a place of\nthe name of Helvoetsluys, and from there to France, to be exiles by the\nside of our chieftain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could say no more than just \u00e2\u0080\u009cO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the name of James More always drying\nup my very voice.\n\nShe was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion of my thought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one thing I must be saying first of all, Mr. David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether very well.\nAnd the one of them two is James More, my father, and the other is the\nLaird of Prestongrange.  Prestongrange will have spoken by himself, or\nhis daughter in the place of him.  But for James More, my father, I have\nthis much to say: he lay shackled in a prison; he is a plain honest\nsoldier and a plain Highland gentleman; what they would be after he would\nnever be guessing; but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice\nto a young gentleman like yourself, he would have died first.  And for\nthe sake of all your friendships, I will be asking you to pardon my\nfather and family for that same mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat that mistake was I do not care to know.  I know\nbut the one thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094that you went to Prestongrange and begged my life upon\nyour knees.  O, I ken well enough it was for your father that you went,\nbut when you were there you pleaded for me also.  It is a thing I cannot\nspeak of.  There are two things I cannot think of into myself: and the\none is your good words when you called yourself my little friend, and the\nother that you pleaded for my life.  Let us never speak more, we two, of\npardon or offence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck and I on her;\nand before there was more speech, a little wind having sprung up in the\nnor\u00e2\u0080\u0099-west, they began to shake out the sails and heave in upon the\nanchor.\n\nThere were six passengers besides our two selves, which made of it a full\ncabin.  Three were solid merchants out of Leith, Kirkcaldy, and Dundee,\nall engaged in the same adventure into High Germany.  One was a Hollander\nreturning; the rest worthy merchants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wives, to the charge of one of whom\nCatriona was recommended.  Mrs. Gebbie (for that was her name) was by\ngreat good fortune heavily incommoded by the sea, and lay day and night\non the broad of her back.  We were besides the only creatures at all\nyoung on board the _Rose_, except a white-faced boy that did my old duty\nto attend upon the table; and it came about that Catriona and I were left\nalmost entirely to ourselves.  We had the next seats together at the\ntable, where I waited on her with extraordinary pleasure.  On deck, I\nmade her a soft place with my cloak; and the weather being singularly\nfine for that season, with bright frosty days and nights, a steady,\ngentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the way through the North\nSea, we sat there (only now and again walking to and fro for warmth) from\nthe first blink of the sun till eight or nine at night under the clear\nstars.  The merchants or Captain Sang would sometimes glance and smile\nupon us, or pass a merry word or two and give us the go-by again; but the\nmost part of the time they were deep in herring and chintzes and linen,\nor in computations of the slowness of the passage, and left us to our own\nconcerns, which were very little important to any but ourselves.\n\nAt the first, we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves pretty\nwitty; and I was at a little pains to be the _beau_, and she (I believe)\nto play the young lady of experience.  But soon we grew plainer with each\nother.  I laid aside my high, clipped English (what little there was left\nof it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes; she, upon her\nside, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we dwelt together like\nthose of the same household, only (upon my side) with a more deep\nemotion.  About the same time the bottom seemed to fall out of our\nconversation, and neither one of us the less pleased.  Whiles she would\ntell me old wives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many of\nthem from my friend red-headed Niel.  She told them very pretty, and they\nwere pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself was in the\nsound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling and I listening.\nWhiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not communicating even with\na look, and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of that\nneighbourhood.  I speak here only for myself.  Of what was in the maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmind, I am not very sure that ever I asked myself; and what was in my\nown, I was afraid to consider.  I need make no secret of it now, either\nto myself or to the reader; I was fallen totally in love.  She came\nbetween me and the sun.  She had grown suddenly taller, as I say, but\nwith a wholesome growth; she seemed all health, and lightness, and brave\nspirits; and I thought she walked like a young deer, and stood like a\nbirch upon the mountains.  It was enough for me to sit near by her on the\ndeck; and I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future, and was\nso well content with what I then enjoyed that I was never at the pains to\nimagine any further step; unless perhaps that I would be sometimes\ntempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there.  But I was too like a\nmiser of what joys I had, and would venture nothing on a hazard.\n\nWhat we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other, so that if\nanyone had been at so much pains as overhear us, he must have supposed us\nthe most egotistical persons in the world.  It befell one day when we\nwere at this practice, that we came on a discourse of friends and\nfriendship, and I think now that we were sailing near the wind.  We said\nwhat a fine thing friendship was, and how little we had guessed of it,\nand how it made life a new thing, and a thousand covered things of the\nsame kind that will have been said, since the foundation of the world, by\nyoung folk in the same predicament.  Then we remarked upon the\nstrangeness of that circumstance, that friends came together in the\nbeginning as if they were there for the first time, and yet each had been\nalive a good while, losing time with other people.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not much that I have done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I could be telling you\nthe five-fifths of it in two-three words.  It is only a girl I am, and\nwhat can befall a girl, at all events?  But I went with the clan in the\nyear \u00e2\u0080\u009945.  The men marched with swords and fire-locks, and some of them\nin brigades in the same set of tartan; they were not backward at the\nmarching, I can tell you.  And there were gentlemen from the Low Country,\nwith their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound, and there was a grand\nskirling of war-pipes.  I rode on a little Highland horse on the right\nhand of my father, James More, and of Glengyle himself.  And here is one\nfine thing that I remember, that Glengyle kissed me in the face, because\n(says he) \u00e2\u0080\u0098my kinswoman, you are the only lady of the clan that has come\nout,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old!  I saw Prince\nCharlie too, and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty indeed!  I had his\nhand to kiss in front of the army.  O, well, these were the good days,\nbut it is all like a dream that I have seen and then awakened.  It went\nwhat way you very well know; and these were the worst days of all, when\nthe red-coat soldiers were out, and my father and uncles lay in the hill,\nand I was to be carrying them their meat in the middle night, or at the\nshort sight of day when the cocks crow.  Yes, I have walked in the night,\nmany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time, and my heart great in me for terror of the darkness.  It\nis a strange thing I will never have been meddled with by a bogle; but\nthey say a maid goes safe.  Next there was my uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marriage, and that\nwas a dreadful affair beyond all.  Jean Kay was that woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name; and\nshe had me in the room with her that night at Inversnaid, the night we\ntook her from her friends in the old, ancient manner.  She would and she\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; she was for marrying Rob the one minute, and the next she would\nbe for none of him.  I will never have seen such a feckless creature of a\nwoman; surely all there was of her would tell her ay or no.  Well, she\nwas a widow; and I can never be thinking a widow a good woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow do you make out that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am only telling you the seeming in my\nheart.  And then to marry a new man!  Fy!  But that was her; and she was\nmarried again upon my Uncle Robin, and went with him awhile to kirk and\nmarket; and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and\ntalked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed; at the least of it, she\nran away, and went back to her own folk, and said we had held her in the\nlake, and I will never tell you all what.  I have never thought much of\nany females since that day.  And so in the end my father, James More,\ncame to be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it an well as me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd through all you had no friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been pretty chief with two-three lasses on the\nbraes, but not to call it friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, mine is a plain tale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never had a friend to my name\ntill I met in with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that brave Mr. Stewart?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, yes, I was forgetting him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he is a man, and that in\nvery different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, yes, it is quite different.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then there was one other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI once thought I had a friend,\nbut it proved a disappointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe asked me who she was?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a he, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were the two best lads at my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nschool, and we thought we loved each other dearly.  Well, the time came\nwhen he went to Glasgow to a merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, that was his second cousin\nonce removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and then he\nfound new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took no notice.\nEh, Catriona, it took me a long while to forgive the world.  There is not\nanything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she began to question me close upon his looks and character, for we\nwere each a great deal concerned in all that touched the other; till at\nlast, in a very evil hour, I minded of his letters and went and fetched\nthe bundle from the cabin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere are his letters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand all the letters that ever I got.\nThat will be the last I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can tell of myself; ye know the lave {26} as\nwell as I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you let me read them, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\nI told her, _if she would be at the pains_; and she bade me go away and\nshe would read them from the one end to the other.  Now, in this bundle\nthat I gave her, there were packed together not only all the letters of\nmy false friend, but one or two of Mr. Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when he was in town at\nthe Assembly, and to make a complete roll of all that ever was written to\nme, Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little word, and the two I had received from Miss Grant,\none when I was on the Bass and one on board that ship.  But of these last\nI had no particular mind at the moment.\n\nI was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that it\nmattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I was in her presence or out\nof it; I had caught her like some kind of a noble fever that lived\ncontinually in my bosom, by night and by day, and whether I was waking or\nasleep.  So it befell that after I was come into the fore-part of the\nship where the broad bows splashed into the billows, I was in no such\nhurry to return as you might fancy; rather prolonged my absence like a\nvariety in pleasure.  I do not think I am by nature much of an Epicurean:\nand there had come till then so small a share of pleasure in my way that\nI might be excused perhaps to dwell on it unduly.\n\nWhen I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful impression as of a\nbuckle slipped, so coldly she returned the packet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have read them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; and I thought my voice sounded not wholly\nnatural, for I was turning in my mind for what could ail her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you mean me to read all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nI told her \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a drooping voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe last of them as well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nI knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her either.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave\nthem all without afterthought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas I supposed that you would\nread them.  I see no harm in any.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be differently made,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank God I am differently\nmade.  It was not a fit letter to be shown me.  It was not fit to be\nwritten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara Grant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, quoting my own expression.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat kind of justice do you call this, to blame me for some words that a\ntomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper?  You\nknow yourself with what respect I have behaved\u00e2\u0080\u0094and would do always.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet you would show me that same letter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want no such\nfriends.  I can be doing very well, Mr. Balfour, without her\u00e2\u0080\u0094or you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is your fine gratitude!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very much obliged to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be asking you to take\naway your\u00e2\u0080\u0094letters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She seemed to choke upon the word, so that it\nsounded like an oath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall never ask twice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; picked up that bundle, walked a\nlittle way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea.  For a\nvery little more I could have cast myself after them.\n\nThe rest of the day I walked up and down raging.  There were few names so\nill but what I gave her them in my own mind before the sun went down.\nAll that I had ever heard of Highland pride seemed quite outdone; that a\ngirl (scarce grown) should resent so trifling an allusion, and that from\nher next friend, that she had near wearied me with praising of!  I had\nbitter, sharp, hard thoughts of her, like an angry boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  If I had\nkissed her indeed (I thought), perhaps she would have taken it pretty\nwell; and only because it had been written down, and with a spice of\njocularity, up she must fuff in this ridiculous passion.  It seemed to me\nthere was a want of penetration in the female sex, to make angels weep\nover the case of the poor men.\n\nWe were side by side again at supper, and what a change was there!  She\nwas like curdled milk to me; her face was like a wooden doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; I could\nhave indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet, but she gave me\nnot the least occasion to do either.  No sooner the meal done than she\nbetook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think she had a little\nneglected heretofore.  But she was to make up for lost time, and in what\nremained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the old lady,\nand on deck began to make a great deal more than I thought wise of\nCaptain Sang.  Not but what the Captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man;\nbut I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with anyone except\nmyself.\n\nAltogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant to keep herself\nsurrounded with others, that I must watch a long while before I could\nfind my opportunity; and after it was found, I made not much of it, as\nyou are now to hear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no guess how I have offended,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit should scarce be\nbeyond pardon, then.  O, try if you can pardon me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no pardon to give,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; and the words seemed to come out of\nher throat like marbles.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be very much obliged for all your\nfriendships.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And she made me an eighth part of a curtsey.\n\nBut I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and I was going to say\nit too.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have shocked your particularity by\nthe showing of that letter, it cannot touch Miss Grant.  She wrote not to\nyou, but to a poor, common, ordinary lad, who might have had more sense\nthan show it.  If you are to blame me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all events!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nCatriona.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is her I will never look the road of, not if she lay\ndying.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She turned away from me, and suddenly back.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you swear you\nwill have no more to deal with her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, and I will never be so unjust then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnor yet so\nungrateful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd now it was I that turned away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\u00e2\u0080\u0094HELVOETSLUYS\n\n\nThe weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in the\nshrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour and cry out\namong the billows.  The song of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce\nceasing, for we thrid all the way among shoals.  About nine in the\nmorning, in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail, I had my\nfirst look of Holland\u00e2\u0080\u0094a line of windmills birling in the breeze.  It was\nbesides my first knowledge of these daft-like contrivances, which gave me\na near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life.  We came to an\nanchor about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys, in a\nplace where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously.\nYou may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs. Gebbie, some of us in\ncloaks, others mantled in the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tarpaulins, all clinging on by\nropes, and jesting the most like old sailor-folk that we could imitate.\n\nPresently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly\nalongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch.  Thence\nCaptain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and the rest of us\ncrowding about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all.  The\n_Rose_ was bound to the port of Rotterdam, whither the other passengers\nwere in a great impatience to arrive, in view of a conveyance due to\nleave that very evening in the direction of the Upper Germany.  This,\nwith the present half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost)\ndeclared himself still capable to save.  Now James More had trysted in\nHelvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged to call before the\nport and place her (according to the custom) in a shore boat.  There was\nthe boat, to be sure, and here was Catriona ready: but both our master\nand the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was in no\nhumour to delay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould be gey an little pleased if we was to\nbreak a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of you.  Take my way\nof it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand come on-by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam.\nYe can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the\nBrill, and thence on again, by a place in a rattel-waggon, back to\nHelvoet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Catriona would hear of no change.  She looked white-like as she\nbeheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes poured\nupon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat\namong the billows; but she stood firmly by her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nfather, James More, will have arranged it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her first word and her\nlast.  I thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to be so\nliteral and stand opposite to so much kind advice; but the fact is she\nhad a very good reason, if she would have told us.  Sailing scoots and\nrattel-waggons are excellent things; only the use of them must first be\npaid for, and all she was possessed of in the world was just two\nshillings and a penny halfpenny sterling.  So it fell out that captain\nand passengers, not knowing of her destitution\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she being too proud to\ntell them\u00e2\u0080\u0094spoke in vain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut since the year \u00e2\u0080\u009946 there are so many of\nthe honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well.  I thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh,\nothers looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion.\nI believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the\ngirl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe: nothing would have\ninduced him to have done so, since it must have involved the lose of his\nconveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness\nof his voice.  At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying\nthe thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the\nship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a\nboatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.  I was\nthinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged\nwith him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in\nLeyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all\none what way I go to Leyden;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and leaped at the same time into the boat,\nwhich I managed not so elegantly but what I fell with two of the fishers\nin the bilge.\n\nFrom the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the\nship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so\nperpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable.  I\nbegan to think I had made a fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bargain, that it was merely impossible\nCatriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to be set ashore\nat Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure\nof embracing James More, if I should want to.  But this was to reckon\nwithout the lass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courage.  She had seen me leap with very little\nappearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not\nto be beat by her discarded friend.  Up she stood on the bulwarks and\nheld by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats, which made the\nenterprise more dangerous, and gave us rather more of a view of her\nstockings than would be thought genteel in cities.  There was no minute\nlost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the\nsame.  I stood up on the other side and spread my arms; the ship swung\ndown on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps\nwholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air.  I was so happy as to\ncatch her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a fall.  She\nheld to me a moment very tight, breathing quick and deep; thence (she\nstill clinging to me with both hands) we were passed aft to our places by\nthe steersman; and Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers cheering\nand crying farewell, the boat was put about for shore.\n\nAs soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly,\nbut said no word.  No more did I; and indeed the whistling of the wind\nand the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our crew\nnot only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that the\n_Rose_ had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the\nharbour mouth.\n\nWe were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according to their\nbeastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required of us our fares.\nTwo guilders was the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demand\u00e2\u0080\u0094between three and four shillings\nEnglish money\u00e2\u0080\u0094for each passenger.  But at this Catriona began to cry out\nwith a vast deal of agitation.  She had asked of Captain Sang, she said,\nand the fare was but an English shilling.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I will have come\non board and not ask first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries she.  The patroon scolded back upon\nher in a lingo where the oaths were English and the rest right Hollands;\ntill at last (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in the rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to receive from her\nthe other shilling without more complaint.  No doubt I was a good deal\nnettled and ashamed.  I like to see folk thrifty, but not with so much\npassion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly that I asked her, as the\nboat moved on again for shore, where it was that she was trysted with her\nfather.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest Scotch\nmerchant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she; and then with the same breath, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am wishing to\nthank you very much\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are a brave friend to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be time enough when I get you to your father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, little\nthinking that I spoke so true.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can tell him a fine tale of a loyal\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried,\nwith a great deal of painfulness in the expression.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not think my\nheart is true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all to obey a\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I observed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot have you to be thinking of me so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\nhad done that same, how would I stop behind?  And at all events that was\nnot all the reasons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Whereupon, with a burning face, she told me the\nplain truth upon her poverty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood guide us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat kind of daft-like proceeding is this, to\nlet yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with an empty purse\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\ncount it hardly decent\u00e2\u0080\u0094scant decent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nis a hunted exile.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I exclaimed.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nwas this fair to them that care for you?  Was it fair to me? was it fair\nto Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would be driven fair\nhorn-mad if she could hear of it?  Was it even fair to these Gregory folk\nthat you were living with, and used you lovingly?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blessing you\nhave fallen in my hands!  Suppose your father hindered by an accident,\nwhat would become of you here, and you your lee-lone in a strange place?\nThe thought of the thing frightens me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have lied to all of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have told them\nall that I had plenty.  I told _her_ too.  I could not be lowering James\nMore to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust, for\nthe lie was originally the father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, not the daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and she thus\nobliged to persevere in it for the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation.  But at the time I\nwas ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her destitution and the\nperils in which see must have fallen, had ruffled me almost beyond\nreason.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will have to learn more sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where I got a\ndirection for Sprott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house in my new French, and we walked there\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was\nsome little way\u00e2\u0080\u0094beholding the place with wonder as we went.  Indeed,\nthere was much for Scots folk to admire: canals and trees being\nintermingled with the houses; the houses, each within itself, of a brave\nred brick, the colour of a rose, with steps and benches of blue marble at\nthe cheek of every door, and the whole town so clean you might have dined\nupon the causeway.  Sprott was within, upon his ledgers, in a low\nparlour, very neat and clean, and set out with china and pictures, and a\nglobe of the earth in a brass frame.  He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty\nman, with a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not that much\ncivility as offer us a seat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken nobody by such a name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, impatient-like.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSince you are so particular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will amend my question, and ask\nyou where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond, _alias_\nMacgregor, _alias_ James More, late tenant in Inveronachile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009che may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my part I wish\nhe was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe young lady is that gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore whom,\nI think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming to discuss his\ncharacter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he in his\ngross voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder your favour, Mr. Sprott,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis young lady is come from\nScotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given the name of your\nhouse for a direction.  An error it seems to have been, but I think this\nplaces both you and me\u00e2\u0080\u0094who am but her fellow-traveller by accident\u00e2\u0080\u0094under\na strong obligation to help our countrywoman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you ding me daft?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cries.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell ye I ken naething and care\nless either for him or his breed.  I tell ye the man owes me money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may very well be, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, who was now rather more angry than\nhimself.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least, I owe you nothing; the young lady is under my\nprotection; and I am neither at all used with these manners, nor in the\nleast content with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did, I drew a\nstep or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere good fortune, on\nthe only argument that could at all affect the man.  The blood left his\nlusty countenance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake dinna be hasty, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am truly wishfu\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nno to be offensive.  But ye ken, sir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like a wheen guid-natured,\nhonest, canty auld fellows\u00e2\u0080\u0094my bark is waur nor my bite.  To hear me, ye\nmicht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour; but na, na! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind auld\nfallow at heart, Sandie Sprott!  And ye could never imagine the fyke and\nfash this man has been to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery good, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I will make that much freedom with your\nkindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welcome, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for the young leddy (my respects to\nher!), he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have clean forgotten her.  I ken the man, ye see; I\nhave lost siller by him ere now.  He thinks of naebody but just himsel\u00e2\u0080\u0099;\nclan, king, or dauchter, if he can get his wameful, he would give them a\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe go-by! ay, or his correspondent either.  For there is a sense in\nwhilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent.  The fact is,\nwe are employed thegether in a business affair, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like to\nturn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott.  The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as guid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my\npairtner, and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is.  He\nmicht be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he michtnae\ncome for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething\u00e2\u0080\u0094or just at the ae thing,\nand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s if he was to pay me my siller.  Ye see what way I stand with\nit; and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy,\nas ye ca\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her.  She cannae stop here, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ae thing certain sure.  Dod,\nsir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a lone man!  If I was to tak her in, its highly possible the\nhellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough of this talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take the young leddy among better\nfriends.  Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave here for James\nMore the address of my correspondent in Leyden.  He can inquire from me\nwhere he is to seek his daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott of his own\nmotion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with Miss Drummond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmails, and even send a porter for them to the inn.  I advanced him to\nthat effect a dollar or two to be a cover, and he gave me an\nacknowledgment in writing of the sum.\n\nWhereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of this\nunpalatable rascal.  She had said no word throughout, leaving me to judge\nand speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been careful not to\nembarrass her by a glance; and even now, although my heart still glowed\ninside of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to seem quite\neasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the\nFrench, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for conveyances to Rotterdam.\nI will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs.\nGebbie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose it will have to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catriona, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough whoever will be\npleased, I do not think it will be her.  And I will remind you this once\nagain that I have but one shilling, and three baubees.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd just this once again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will remind you it was a blessing\nthat I came alongst with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else would I be thinking all this time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, and I thought\nweighed a little on my arm.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is you that are the good friend to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\u00e2\u0080\u0094TRAVELS IN HOLLAND\n\n\nThe rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with benches,\ncarried us in four hours of travel to the great city of Rotterdam.  It\nwas long past dark by then, but the streets were pretty brightly lighted\nand thronged with wild-like, outlandish characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094bearded Hebrews, black\nmen, and the hordes of courtesans, most indecently adorned with finery\nand stopping seamen by their very sleeves; the clash of talk about us\nmade our heads to whirl; and what was the most unexpected of all, we\nappeared to be no more struck with all these foreigners than they with\nus.  I made the best face I could, for the lass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake and my own credit;\nbut the truth is I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom\nwith anxiety.  Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or the berth of\nthe ship _Rose_: but either fell on some who spoke only Hollands, or my\nown French failed me.  Trying a street at a venture, I came upon a lane\nof lighted houses, the doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted\nwomen; these jostled and mocked upon us as we passed, and I was thankful\nwe had nothing of their language.  A little after we issued forth upon an\nopen place along the harbour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall be doing now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries I, as soon as I spied masts.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us walk\nhere by the harbour.  We are sure to meet some that has the English, and\nat the best of it we may light upon that very ship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the evening, whom\nshould we walk into the arms of but Captain Sang?  He told us they had\nmade their run in the most incredible brief time, the wind holding strong\ntill they reached port; by which means his passengers were all gone\nalready on their further travels.  It was impossible to chase after the\nGebbies into the High Germany, and we had no other acquaintance to fall\nback upon but Captain Sang himself.  It was the more gratifying to find\nthe man friendly and wishful to assist.  He made it a small affair to\nfind some good plain family of merchants, where Catriona might harbour\ntill the _Rose_ was loaden; declared he would then blithely carry her\nback to Leith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of Mr. Gregory;\nand in the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the meal we stood\nin need of.  He seemed extremely friendly, as I say, but what surprised\nme a good deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and the cause of this\nwas soon to appear.  For at the ordinary, calling for Rhenish wine and\ndrinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably tipsy.  In this case, as\ntoo common with all men, but especially with those of his rough trade,\nwhat little sense or manners he possessed deserted him; and he behaved\nhimself so scandalous to the young lady, jesting most ill-favouredly at\nthe figure she had made on the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rail, that I had no resource but\ncarry her suddenly away.\n\nShe came out of the ordinary clinging to me close.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake me away,\nDavid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ keep me.  I am not afraid with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd have no cause, my little friend!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, and could have found it\nin my heart to weep.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere will you be taking me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave me at all\nevents\u00e2\u0080\u0094never leave me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere am I taking you to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I stopping, for I had been staving on\nahead in mere blindness.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must stop and think.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not leave\nyou, Catriona; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I should fail or\nfash you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe crept close into me by way of a reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis the stillest place we have hit on yet in this busy\nbyke of a city.  Let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our\ncourse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by the harbour\nside.  It was like a black night, but lights were in the houses, and\nnearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a shining of the city on the\none hand, and a buzz hung over it of many thousands walking and talking;\non the other, it was dark and the water bubbled on the sides.  I spread\nmy cloak upon a builder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stone, and made her sit there; she would have\nkept her hold upon me, for she still shook with the late affronts; but I\nwanted to think clear, disengaged myself, and paced to and fro before\nher, in the manner of what we call a smuggler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk, belabouring my\nbrains for any remedy.  By the course of these scattering thoughts I was\nbrought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that, in the heat and\nhaste of our departure, I had left Captain Sang to pay the ordinary.  At\nthis I began to laugh out loud, for I thought the man well served; and at\nthe same time, by an instinctive movement, carried my hand to the pocket\nwhere my money was.  I suppose it was in the lane where the women jostled\nus; but there is only the one thing certain, that my purse was gone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will have thought of something good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, observing me to\npause.\n\nAt the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear as a perspective\nglass, and I saw there was no choice of methods.  I had not one doit of\ncoin, but in my pocket-book I had still my letter on the Leyden merchant;\nand there was now but the one way to get to Leyden, and that was to walk\non our two feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re brave and I believe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strong\u00e2\u0080\u0094do\nyou think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  We found it, I\nbelieve, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was my notion of the\ndistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you will just keep near, I will go anywhere and do\nanything.  The courage of my heart, it is all broken.  Do not be leaving\nme in this horrible country by myself, and I will do all else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you start now and march all night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do all that you can ask of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand never ask you why.\nI have been a bad ungrateful girl to you; and do what you please with me\nnow!  And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I do not see what she would deny you for at all events.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other matters to consider, and\nthe first of these was to get clear of that city on the Leyden road.  It\nproved a cruel problem; and it may have been one or two at night ere we\nhad solved it.  Once beyond the houses, there was neither moon nor stars\nto guide us; only the whiteness of the way in the midst and a blackness\nof an alley on both hands.  The walking was besides made most\nextraordinary difficult by a plain black frost that fell suddenly in the\nsmall hours and turned that highway into one long slide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Catriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere we are like the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sons and the old\nwives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daughters in your daft-like Highland tales.  Soon we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going\nover the \u00e2\u0080\u0098_seven Bens_, _the seven glens and the seven mountain moors_\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhich was a common byword or overcome in those tales of hers that had\nstuck in my memory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut here are no glens or mountains!  Though I will never\nbe denying but what the trees and some of the plain places hereabouts are\nvery pretty.  But our country is the best yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish we could say as much for our own folk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, recalling Sprott\nand Sang, and perhaps James More himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will never complain of the country of my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and spoke\nit out with an accent so particular that I seemed to see the look upon\nher face.\n\nI caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for my pains) on the\nblack ice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know what _you_ think, Catriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, when I was a little\nrecovered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut this has been the best day yet!  I think shame to say it,\nwhen you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours; but for me, it\nhas been the best day yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a good day when you showed me so much love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet I think shame to be happy too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you here on the\nroad in the black night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere in the great world would I be else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thinking I\nam safest where I am with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite forgiven, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your\nmouth again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing in this heart to you but\nthanks.  But I will be honest too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, with a kind of suddenness,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never can forgive that girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this Miss Grant again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said yourself she was the best\nlady in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo she will be, indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Catriona.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will never forgive her\nfor all that.  I will never, never forgive her, and let me hear tell of\nher no more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis beats all that ever came to my knowledge; and I\nwonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims.  Here is a\nyoung lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us, that\nlearned us how to dress ourselves, and in a great manner how to behave,\nas anyone can see that knew us both before and after.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is this way of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither you will go on to speak of\nher, and I will go back to yon town, and let come of it what God pleases!\nOr else you will do me that politeness to talk of other things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I bethought me that\nshe depended altogether on my help, that she was of the frail sex and not\nso much beyond a child, and it was for me to be wise for the pair of us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can make neither head nor tails of this; but\nGod forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee.  As for\ntalking of Miss Grant, I have no such a mind to it, and I believe it was\nyourself began it.  My only design (if I took you up at all) was for your\nown improvement, for I hate the very look of injustice.  Not that I do\nnot wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy; they become\nyou well; but here you show them to excess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, have you done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA very good thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and we went on again, but now in silence.\n\nIt was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night, beholding only\nshadows and hearing nought but our own steps.  At first, I believe our\nhearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity; but the darkness\nand the cold, and the silence, which only the cocks sometimes\ninterrupted, or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had pretty soon brought down\nour pride to the dust; and for my own particular, I would have jumped at\nany decent opening for speech.\n\nBefore the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and the frost was all\nwiped away from among our feet.  I took my cloak to her and sought to hap\nher in the same; she bade me, rather impatiently, to keep it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed and I will do no such thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere am I, a great, ugly\nlad that has seen all kinds of weather, and here are you a tender, pretty\nmaid!  My dear, you would not put me to a shame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWithout more words she let me cover her; which as I was doing in the\ndarkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an\nembrace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must try to be more patient of your friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nI thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against my\nbosom, or perhaps it was but fancy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will be no end to your goodness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nAnd we went on again in silence; but now all was changed; and the\nhappiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney.\n\nThe rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as we came into the\ntown of Delft.  The red gabled houses made a handsome show on either hand\nof a canal; the servant lassies were out slestering and scrubbing at the\nvery stones upon the public highway; smoke rose from a hundred kitchens;\nand it came in upon me strongly it was time to break our fasts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you have yet a shilling and three\nbaubees?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you wanting it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and passed me her purse.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am wishing\nit was five pounds!  What will you want it for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what have we been walking for all night, like a pair of waif\nEgyptians!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust because I was robbed of my purse and all I\npossessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam.  I will tell you of it now,\nbecause I think the worst is over, but we have still a good tramp before\nus till we get to where my money is, and if you would not buy me a piece\nof bread, I were like to go fasting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at me with open eyes.  By the light of the new day she was all\nblack and pale for weariness, so that my heart smote me for her.  But as\nfor her, she broke out laughing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy torture! are we beggars then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou too?  O, I could have\nwished for this same thing!  And I am glad to buy your breakfast to you.\nBut it would be pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to\nyou!  For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of\ndancing over here, and might be paying for the curiosity of that sight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, but in a\nheat of admiration.  For it always warms a man to see a woman brave.\n\nWe got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the town, and\nin a baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling bread, which we\nate upon the road as we went on.  That road from Delft to the Hague is\njust five miles of a fine avenue shaded with trees, a canal on the one\nhand, on the other excellent pastures of cattle.  It was pleasant here\nindeed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat will you do with me at all events?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is what we have to speak of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the sooner yet the better.\nI can come by money in Leyden; that will be all well.  But the trouble is\nhow to dispose of you until your father come.  I thought last night you\nseemed a little sweir to part from me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be more than seeming then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a very young maid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I am but a very young callant.\nThis is a great piece of difficulty.  What way are we to manage?  Unless\nindeed, you could pass to be my sister?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what for no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you would let me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you were so, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would be a fine man if I had\nsuch a sister.  But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now I will be Catriona Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who is to ken?\nThey are all strange folk here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think that it would do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI own it troubles me.  I would\nlike it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid, I have no friend here but you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am too\nyoung to advise you, or you to be advised.  I see not what else we are to\ndo, and yet I ought to warn you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have no choice left,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father James More has not\nused me very well, and it is not the first time, I am cast upon your\nhands like a sack of barley meal, and have nothing else to think of but\nyour pleasure.  If you will have me, good and well.  If you will not\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\nturned and touched her hand upon my arm\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid, I am afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, but I ought to warn you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began; and then bethought me I was the\nbearer of the purse, and it would never do to seem too churlish.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t misunderstand me: I am just trying to do my\nduty by you, girl!  Here am I going alone to this strange city, to be a\nsolitary student there; and here is this chance arisen that you might\ndwell with me a bit, and be like my sister; you can surely understand\nthis much, my dear, that I would just love to have you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and here I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soon settled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain.  I know this was a\ngreat blot on my character, for which I was lucky that I did not pay more\ndear.  But I minded how easy her delicacy had been startled with a word\nof kissing her in Barbara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter; now that she depended on me, how was\nI to be more bold?  Besides, the truth is, I could see no other feasible\nmethod to dispose of her.  And I daresay inclination pulled me very\nstrong.\n\nA little beyond the Hague she fell very lame and made the rest of the\ndistance heavily enough.  Twice she must rest by the wayside, which she\ndid with pretty apologies, calling herself a shame to the Highlands and\nthe race she came of, and nothing but a hindrance to myself.  It was her\nexcuse, she said, that she was not much used with walking shod.  I would\nhave had her strip off her shoes and stockings and go barefoot.  But she\npointed out to me that the women of that country, even in the landward\nroads, appeared to be all shod.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not be disgracing my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and was very merry with\nit all, although her face told tales of her.\n\nThere is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded below with clean\nsand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some preached,\nand the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours.  Here I left\nCatriona, and went forward by myself to find my correspondent.  There I\ndrew on my credit, and asked to be recommended to some decent, retired\nlodging.  My baggage being not yet arrived, I told him I supposed I\nshould require his caution with the people of the house; and explained\nthat, my sister being come for a while to keep house with me, I should be\nwanting two chambers.  This was all very well; but the trouble was that\nMr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great\ndeal of particulars, and never a word of any sister in the case.  I could\nsee my Dutchman was extremely suspicious; and viewing me over the rims of\na great pair of spectacles\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was a poor, frail body, and reminded me of\nan infirm rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0094he began to question me close.\n\nHere I fell in a panic.  Suppose he accept my tale (thinks I), suppose he\ninvite my sister to his house, and that I bring her.  I shall have a fine\nravelled pirn to unwind, and may end by disgracing both the lassie and\nmyself.  Thereupon I began hastily to expound to him my sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncharacter.  She was of a bashful disposition, it appeared, and be\nextremely fearful of meeting strangers that I had left her at that moment\nsitting in a public place alone.  And then, being launched upon the\nstream of falsehood, I must do like all the rest of the world in the same\ncircumstance, and plunge in deeper than was any service; adding some\naltogether needless particulars of Miss Balfour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ill-health and\nretirement during childhood.  In the midst of which I awoke to a sense of\nmy behaviour, and was turned to one blush.\n\nThe old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a\nwillingness to be quit of me.  But he was first of all a man of business;\nand knowing that my money was good enough, however it might be with my\nconduct, he was so far obliging as to send his son to be my guide and\ncaution in the matter of a lodging.  This implied my presenting of the\nyoung man to Catriona.  The poor, pretty child was much recovered with\nresting, looked and behaved to perfection, and took my arm and gave me\nthe name of brother more easily than I could answer her.  But there was\none misfortune: thinking to help, she was rather towardly than otherwise\nto my Dutchman.  And I could not but reflect that Miss Balfour had rather\nsuddenly outgrown her bashfulness.  And there was another thing, the\ndifference of our speech.  I had the Low Country tongue and dwelled upon\nmy words; she had a hill voice, spoke with something of an English\naccent, only far more delightful, and was scarce quite fit to be called a\ndeacon in the craft of talking English grammar; so that, for a brother\nand sister, we made a most uneven pair.  But the young Hollander was a\nheavy dog, without so much spirit in his belly as to remark her\nprettiness, for which I scorned him.  And as soon as he had found a cover\nto our heads, he left us alone, which was the greater service of the two.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\u00e2\u0080\u0094FULL STORY OF A COPY OF HEINECCIUS\n\n\nThe place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal.  We\nhad two rooms, the second entering from the first; each had a chimney\nbuilt out into the floor in the Dutch manner; and being alongside, each\nhad the same prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in a\nlittle court, of a piece of the canal, and of houses in the Hollands\narchitecture and a church spire upon the further side.  A full set of\nbells hung in that spire and made delightful music; and when there was\nany sun at all, it shone direct in our two chambers.  From a tavern hard\nby we had good meals sent in.\n\nThe first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely so.  There\nwas little talk between us, and I packed her off to her bed as soon as\nshe had eaten.  The first thing in the morning I wrote word to Sprott to\nhave her mails sent on, together with a line to Alan at his chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and\nhad the same despatched, and her breakfast ready, ere I waked her.  I was\na little abashed when she came forth in her one habit, and the mud of the\nway upon her stockings.  By what inquiries I had made, it seemed a good\nfew days must pass before her mails could come to hand in Leyden, and it\nwas plainly needful she must have a shift of things.  She was unwilling\nat first that I should go to that expense; but I reminded her she was now\na rich man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister and must appear suitably in the part, and we had not\ngot to the second merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s before she was entirely charmed into the\nspirit of the thing, and her eyes shining.  It pleased me to see her so\ninnocent and thorough in this pleasure.  What was more extraordinary was\nthe passion into which I fell on it myself; being never satisfied that I\nhad bought her enough or fine enough, and never weary of beholding her in\ndifferent attires.  Indeed, I began to understand some little of Miss\nGrant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immersion in the interest of clothes; for the truth is, when you\nhave the ground of a beautiful person to adorn, the whole business\nbecomes beautiful.  The Dutch chintzes I should say were extraordinary\ncheap and fine; but I would be ashamed to set down what I paid for\nstockings to her.  Altogether I spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring\n(as I may call it) that I was ashamed for a great while to spend more;\nand by way of a set-off, I left our chambers pretty bare.  If we had\nbeds, if Catriona was a little braw, and I had light to see her by, we\nwere richly enough lodged for me.\n\nBy the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her at the door with\nall our purchases, and go for a long walk alone in which to read myself a\nlecture.  Here had I taken under my roof, and as good as to my bosom, a\nyoung lass extremely beautiful, and whose innocence was her peril.  My\ntalk with the old Dutchman, and the lies to which I was constrained, had\nalready given me a sense of how my conduct must appear to others; and\nnow, after the strong admiration I had just experienced and the\nimmoderacy with which I had continued my vain purchases, I began to think\nof it myself as very hazarded.  I bethought me, if I had a sister indeed,\nwhether I would so expose her; then, judging the case too problematical,\nI varied my question into this, whether I would so trust Catriona in the\nhands of any other Christian being; the answer to which made my face to\nburn.  The more cause, since I had been entrapped and had entrapped the\ngirl into an undue situation, that I should behave in it with scrupulous\nnicety.  She depended on me wholly for her bread and shelter; in case I\nshould alarm her delicacy, she had no retreat.  Besides I was her host\nand her protector; and the more irregularly I had fallen in these\npositions, the less excuse for me if I should profit by the same to\nforward even the most honest suit; for with the opportunities that I\nenjoyed, and which no wise parent would have suffered for a moment, even\nthe most honest suit would be unfair.  I saw I must be extremely hold-off\nin my relations; and yet not too much so neither; for if I had no right\nto appear at all in the character of a suitor, I must yet appear\ncontinually, and if possible agreeably, in that of host.  It was plain I\nshould require a great deal of tact and conduct, perhaps more than my\nyears afforded.  But I had rushed in where angels might have feared to\ntread, and there was no way out of that position save by behaving right\nwhile I was in it.  I made a set of rules for my guidance; prayed for\nstrength to be enabled to observe them, and as a more human aid to the\nsame end purchased a study-book in law.  This being all that I could\nthink of, I relaxed from these grave considerations; whereupon my mind\nbubbled at once into an effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was\nlike one treading on air that I turned homeward.  As I thought that name\nof home, and recalled the image of that figure awaiting me between four\nwalls, my heart beat upon my bosom.\n\nMy troubles began with my return.  She ran to greet me with an obvious\nand affecting pleasure.  She was clad, besides, entirely in the new\nclothes that I had bought for her; looked in them beyond expression well;\nand must walk about and drop me curtseys to display them and to be\nadmired.  I am sure I did it with an ill grace, for I thought to have\nchoked upon the words.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you will not be caring for my pretty clothes, see\nwhat I have done with our two chambers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And she showed me the place all\nvery finely swept, and the fires glowing in the two chimneys.\n\nI was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than I quite felt.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very much displeased with you, and you must\nnever again lay a hand upon my room.  One of us two must have the rule\nwhile we are here together; it is most fit it should be I who am both the\nman and the elder; and I give you that for my command.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe dropped me one of her curtseys; which were extraordinary taking.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nyou will be cross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be making pretty manners at you,\nDavie.  I will be very obedient, as I should be when every stitch upon\nall there is of me belongs to you.  But you will not be very cross\neither, because now I have not anyone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of penitence, to blot\nout all the good effect of my last speech.  In this direction progress\nwas more easy, being down hill; she led me forward, smiling; at the sight\nof her, in the brightness of the fire and with her pretty becks and\nlooks, my heart was altogether melted.  We made our meal with infinite\nmirth and tenderness; and the two seemed to be commingled into one, so\nthat our very laughter sounded like a kindness.\n\nIn the midst of which I awoke to better recollections, made a lame word\nof excuse, and set myself boorishly to my studies.  It was a substantial,\ninstructive book that I had bought, by the late Dr. Heineccius, in which\nI was to do a great deal reading these next few days, and often very glad\nthat I had no one to question me of what I read.  Methought she bit her\nlip at me a little, and that cut me.  Indeed it left her wholly solitary,\nthe more as she was very little of a reader, and had never a book.  But\nwhat was I to do?\n\nSo the rest of the evening flowed by almost without speech.\n\nI could have beat myself.  I could not lie in my bed that night for rage\nand repentance, but walked to and fro on my bare feet till I was nearly\nperished, for the chimney was gone out and the frost keen.  The thought\nof her in the next room, the thought that she might even hear me as I\nwalked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I must continue to\npractise the same ungrateful course or be dishonoured, put me beside my\nreason.  I stood like a man between Scylla and Charybdis: _What must she\nthink of me_? was my one thought that softened me continually into\nweakness.  _What is to become of us_? the other which steeled me again to\nresolution.  This was my first night of wakefulness and divided counsels,\nof which I was now to pass many, pacing like a madman, sometimes weeping\nlike a childish boy, sometimes praying (I fain would hope) like a\nChristian.\n\nBut prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in practice.  In\nher presence, and above all if I allowed any beginning of familiarity, I\nfound I had very little command of what should follow.  But to sit all\nday in the same room with her, and feign to be engaged upon Heineccius,\nsurpassed my strength.  So that I fell instead upon the expedient of\nabsenting myself so much as I was able; taking out classes and sitting\nthere regularly, often with small attention, the test of which I found\nthe other day in a note-book of that period, where I had left off to\nfollow an edifying lecture and actually scribbled in my book some very\nill verses, though the Latinity is rather better than I thought that I\ncould ever have compassed.  The evil of this course was unhappily near as\ngreat as its advantage.  I had the less time of trial, but I believe,\nwhile the time lasted, I was tried the more extremely.  For she being so\nmuch left to solitude, she came to greet my return with an increasing\nfervour that came nigh to overmaster me.  These friendly offers I must\nbarbarously cast back; and my rejection sometimes wounded her so cruelly\nthat I must unbend and seek to make it up to her in kindness.  So that\nour time passed in ups and downs, tiffs and disappointments, upon the\nwhich I could almost say (if it may be said with reverence) that I was\ncrucified.\n\nThe base of my trouble was Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinary innocence, at which I\nwas not so much surprised as filled with pity and admiration.  She seemed\nto have no thought of our position, no sense of my struggles; welcomed\nany mark of my weakness with responsive joy; and when I was drove again\nto my retrenchments, did not always dissemble her chagrin.  There were\ntimes when I have thought to myself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she were over head in love, and\nset her cap to catch me, she would scarce behave much otherwise;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nthen I would fall again into wonder at the simplicity of woman, from whom\nI felt (in these moments) that I was not worthy to be descended.\n\nThere was one point in particular on which our warfare turned, and of all\nthings, this was the question of her clothes.  My baggage had soon\nfollowed me from Rotterdam, and hers from Helvoet.  She had now, as it\nwere, two wardrobes; and it grew to be understood between us (I could\nnever tell how) that when she was friendly she would wear my clothes, and\nwhen otherwise her own.  It was meant for a buffet, and (as it were) the\nrenunciation of her gratitude; and I felt it so in my bosom, but was\ngenerally more wise than to appear to have observed the circumstance.\n\nOnce, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater than her own; it\nfell in this way.  On my return from classes, thinking upon her devoutly\nwith a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain,\nthe annoyance began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in a window\none of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders are so skilled in\nthe artifice, I gave way to an impulse and bought it for Catriona.  I do\nnot know the name of that flower, but it was of the pink colour, and I\nthought she would admire the same, and carried it home to her with a\nwonderful soft heart.  I had left her in my clothes, and when I returned\nto find her all changed and a face to match, I cast but the one look at\nher from head to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the window open,\nand my flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence) myself\nout of that room again, of which I slammed she door as I went out.\n\nOn the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought me to myself, so\nthat I began at once to see the folly of my conduct.  I went, not into\nthe street as I had purposed, but to the house court, which was always a\nsolitary place, and where I saw my flower (that had cost me vastly more\nthan it was worth) hanging in the leafless tree.  I stood by the side of\nthe canal, and looked upon the ice.  Country people went by on their\nskates, and I envied them.  I could see no way out of the pickle I was in\nno way so much as to return to the room I had just left.  No doubt was in\nmy mind but I had now betrayed the secret of my feelings; and to make\nthings worse, I had shown at the same time (and that with wretched\nboyishness) incivility to my helpless guest.\n\nI suppose she must have seen me from the open window.  It did not seem to\nme that I had stood there very long before I heard the crunching of\nfootsteps on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in\nno spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near.  She was all\nchanged again, to the clocked stockings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we not to have our walk to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nI was looking at her in a maze.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is your brooch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\nShe carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will have\nforgotten it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will run upstairs for it quick, and then\nsurely we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can have our walk?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me; I had\nneither words nor voice to utter them; I could do no more than nod by way\nof answer; and the moment she had left me, climbed into the tree and\nrecovered my flower, which on her return I offered her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bought it for you, Catriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nShe fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch, I could have\nthought tenderly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is none the better of my handling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I again, and blushed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nWe did not speak so much that day; she seemed a thought on the reserve,\nthough not unkindly.  As for me, all the time of our walking, and after\nwe came home, and I had seen her put my flower into a pot of water, I was\nthinking to myself what puzzles women were.  I was thinking, the one\nmoment, it was the most stupid thing on earth she should not have\nperceived my love; and the next, that she had certainly perceived it long\nago, and (being a wise girl with the fine female instinct of propriety)\nconcealed her knowledge.\n\nWe had our walk daily.  Out in the streets I felt more safe; I relaxed a\nlittle in my guardedness; and for one thing, there was no Heineccius.\nThis made these periods not only a relief to myself, but a particular\npleasure to my poor child.  When I came back about the hour appointed, I\nwould generally find her ready dressed, and glowing with anticipation.\nShe would prolong their duration to the extreme, seeming to dread (as I\ndid myself) the hour of the return; and there is scarce a field or\nwaterside near Leyden, scarce a street or lane there, where we have not\nlingered.  Outside of these, I bade her confine herself entirely to our\nlodgings; this in the fear of her encountering any acquaintance, which\nwould have rendered our position very difficult.  From the same\napprehension I would never suffer her to attend church, nor even go\nmyself; but made some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own\nchamber\u00e2\u0080\u0094I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with a very much\ndivided mind.  Indeed, there was scarce anything that more affected me,\nthan thus to kneel down alone with her before God like man and wife.\n\nOne day it was snowing downright hard.  I had thought it not possible\nthat we should venture forth, and was surprised to find her waiting for\nme ready dressed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not be doing without my walk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are never a good\nboy, Davie, in the house; I will never be caring for you only in the open\nair.  I think we two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the\nroadside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung near to me in the\nfalling snow; it beat about and melted on us, and the drops stood upon\nher bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling mouth.  Strength\nseemed to come upon me with the sight like a giant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; I thought I could\nhave caught her up and run with her into the uttermost places in the\nearth; and we spoke together all that time beyond belief for freedom and\nsweetness.\n\nIt was the dark night when we came to the house door.  She pressed my arm\nupon her bosom.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you kindly for these same good hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she,\non a deep note of her voice.\n\nThe concern in which I fell instantly on this address, put me with the\nsame swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and the\nlight made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the\nstudent of Heineccius.  Doubtless she was more than usually hurt; and I\nknow for myself, I found it more than usually difficult to maintain any\nstrangeness.  Even at the meal, I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift\nmy eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again to my\ncivilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than\nbefore.  Methought, as I read, I could hear my heart strike like an\neight-day clock.  Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my\neyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona.  She sat on the\nfloor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and\nshone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder\nof fine hues.  Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then again at me;\nand at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and turn the pages\nof Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church.\n\nSuddenly she called out aloud.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, why does not my father come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried, and fell at once into a storm of tears.\n\nI leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her side, and\ncast an arm around her sobbing body.\n\nShe put me from her sharply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do not love your friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncould be so happy too, if you would let me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, what will I\nhave done that you should hate me so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHate you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries I, and held her firm.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou blind less, can you not see\na little in my wretched heart?  Do you not think when I sit there,\nreading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it, I\ntake ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself?\nNight after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone.\nAnd what was I to do?  You are here under my honour; would you punish me\nfor that?  Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung near to me.  I raised\nher face to mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon my bosom,\nclasping me tight.  I saw in a mere whirl like a man drunken.  Then I\nheard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you kiss her truly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nThere went through me so great a heave of surprise that I was all shook\nwith it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Grant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, all in a disorder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I asked her to kiss me\ngood-bye, the which she did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have kissed me too, at all events.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the strangeness and sweetness of that word, I saw where we had fallen;\nrose, and set her on her feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will never do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will never, never do.  O Catrine,\nCatrine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Then there came a pause in which I was debarred from any\nspeaking.  And then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away to your bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away to your bed\nand leave me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned to obey me like a child, and the next I knew of it, had\nstopped in the very doorway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood night, Davie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd O, good night, my love!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, with a great outbreak of my soul,\nand caught her to me again, so that it seemed I must have broken her.\nThe next moment I had thrust her from the room, shut to the door even\nwith violence, and stood alone.\n\nThe milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth told.  I had crept\nlike an untrusty man into the poor maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affections; she was in my hand\nlike any frail, innocent thing to make or mar; and what weapon of defence\nwas left me?  It seemed like a symbol that Heineccius, my old protection,\nwas now burned.  I repented, yet could not find it in my heart to blame\nmyself for that great failure.  It seemed not possible to have resisted\nthe boldness of her innocence or that last temptation of her weeping.\nAnd all that I had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the greater\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nwas upon a nature so defenceless, and with such advantages of the\nposition, that I seemed to have practised.\n\nWhat was to become of us now?  It seemed we could no longer dwell in the\none place.  But where was I to go? or where she?  Without either choice\nor fault of ours, life had conspired to wall us together in that narrow\nplace.  I had a wild thought of marrying out of hand; and the next moment\nput it from me with revolt.  She was a child, she could not tell her own\nheart; I had surprised her weakness, I must never go on to build on that\nsurprisal; I must keep her not only clear of reproach, but free as she\nhad come to me.\n\nDown I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented, and beat my\nbrains in vain for any means of escape.  About two of the morning, there\nwere three red embers left and the house and all the city was asleep,\nwhen I was aware of a small sound of weeping in the next room.  She\nthought that I slept, the poor soul; she regretted her weakness\u00e2\u0080\u0094and what\nperhaps (God help her!) she called her forwardness\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in the dead of the\nnight solaced herself with tears.  Tender and bitter feelings, love and\npenitence and pity, struggled in my soul; it seemed I was under bond to\nheal that weeping.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, try to forgive me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctry, try to forgive me.  Let us\nforget it all, let us try if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no can forget it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere came no answer, but the sobbing ceased.  I stood a long while with\nmy hands still clasped as I had spoken; then the cold of the night laid\nhold upon me with a shudder, and I think my reason reawakened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can make no hand of this, Davie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thinks I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo bed with you like a\nwise lad, and try if you can sleep.  To-morrow you may see your way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE\n\n\nI was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a\nknocking on my door, ran to open it, and had almost swooned with the\ncontrariety of my feelings, mostly painful; for on the threshold, in a\nrough wraprascal and an extraordinary big laced hat, there stood James\nMore.\n\nI ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was a\nsense in which the man came like an answer to prayer.  I had been saying\ntill my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate, and looking\ntill my head ached for any possible means of separation.  Here were the\nmeans come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hindmost of my thoughts.\nIt is to be considered, however, that even if the weight of the future\nwere lifted off me by the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival, the present heaved up the more\nblack and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in my shirt and\nbreeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward like a person shot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have found you, Mr. Balfour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And offered me his\nlarge, fine hand, the which (recovering at the same time my post in the\ndoorway, as if with some thought of resistance) I took him by doubtfully.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe continued.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am owing you an apology for an unfortunate intrusion\nupon yours, which I suffered myself to be entrapped into by my confidence\nin that false-face, Prestongrange; I think shame to own to you that I was\never trusting to a lawyer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He shrugged his shoulders with a very French\nair.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut indeed the man is very plausible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now it seems\nthat you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter,\nfor whose direction I was remitted to yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, with a very painful air, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it will be\nnecessary we two should have an explanation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing amiss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy agent, Mr. Sprott\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake moderate your voice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must not hear till\nwe have had an explanation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is in this place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is her chamber door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are here with her alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd who else would I have got to stay with us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries I.\n\nI will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is very unusual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a very unusual circumstance.\nYou are right, we must hold an explanation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo saying he passed me by, and I must own the tall old rogue appeared at\nthat moment extraordinary dignified.  He had now, for the first time, the\nview of my chamber, which I scanned (I may say) with his eyes.  A bit of\nmorning sun glinted in by the window pane, and showed it off; my bed, my\nmails, and washing dish, with some disorder of my clothes, and the\nunlighted chimney, made the only plenishing; no mistake but it looked\nbare and cold, and the most unsuitable, beggarly place conceivable to\nharbour a young lady.  At the same time came in on my mind the\nrecollection of the clothes that I had bought for her; and I thought this\ncontrast of poverty and prodigality bore an ill appearance.\n\nHe looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing else to\nhis purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of it; where, after\nI had closed the door, I could not very well avoid joining him.  For\nhowever this extraordinary interview might end, it must pass if possible\nwithout waking Catriona; and the one thing needful was that we should sit\nclose and talk low.  But I can scarce picture what a pair we made; he in\nhis great coat which the coldness of my chamber made extremely suitable;\nI shivering in my shirt and breeks; he with very much the air of a judge;\nand I (whatever I looked) with very much the feelings of a man who has\nheard the last trumpet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nAnd \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began, but found myself unable to go further.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou tell me she is here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he again, but now with a spice of\nimpatience that seemed to brace me up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is in this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I knew the circumstance would be\ncalled unusual.  But you are to consider how very unusual the whole\nbusiness was from the beginning.  Here is a young lady landed on the\ncoast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny.  She is\ndirected to yon man Sprott in Helvoet.  I hear you call him your agent.\nAll I can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at the mere\nmention of your name, and I must fee him out of my own pocket even to\nreceive the custody of her effects.  You speak of unusual circumstances,\nMr. Drummond, if that be the name you prefer.  Here was a circumstance,\nif you like, to which it was barbarity to have exposed her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut this is what I cannot understand the least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\ndaughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons, whose\nnames I have forgot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGebbie was the name,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand there is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie\nshould have gone ashore with her at Helvoet.  But he did not, Mr.\nDrummond; and I think you might praise God that I was there to offer in\nhis place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for\nyourself, I think it might have occurred that you were somewhat young for\nsuch a post.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the choice was not between me and somebody else, it was between me\nand nobody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody offered in my place, and I must say I\nthink you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the\nparticular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\nchild was deserted, she was clean flung away in the midst of Europe, with\nscarce two shillings, and not two words of any language spoken there: I\nmust say, a bonny business!  I brought her to this place.  I gave her the\nname and the tenderness due to a sister.  All this has not gone without\nexpense, but that I scarce need to hint at.  They were services due to\nthe young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character which I respect; and I think it would be a\nbonny business too, if I was to be singing her praises to her father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I hear you tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, with a good deal of heat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a very young man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor you would have understood\nthe significancy of the step.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you speak very much at your ease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else was I to\ndo?  It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor woman to be a\nthird to us, and I declare I never thought of it until this moment!  But\nwhere was I to find her, that am a foreigner myself?  And let me point\nout to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it would have cost me money\nout of my pocket.  For here is just what it comes to, that I had to pay\nthrough the nose for your neglect; and there is only the one story to it,\njust that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss Drummond before\nwe go on to sit in judgment on her father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will be entrapped into no such attitude,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe character\nof Miss Drummond is far above inquiry, as her father ought to know.  So\nis mine, and I am telling you that.  There are but the two ways of it\nopen.  The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to\nanother, and to say no more.  The other (if you are so difficult as to be\nstill dissatisfied) is to pay me, that which I have expended and be\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour.  It is a good thing that\nI have learned to be more patient.  And I believe you forget that I have\nyet to see my daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in the\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manner that I spied in him as soon as the name of money fell\nbetween us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thinking it would be more fit\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you will excuse the plainness of\nmy dressing in your presence\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I should go forth and leave you to\nencounter her alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I would have looked for at your hands!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he; and there was no\nmistake but what he said it civilly.\n\nI thought this better and better still, and as I began to pull on my\nhose, recalling the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I\ndetermined to pursue what seemed to be my victory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis room\nis very much at your disposal, and I can easy find another for myself: in\nwhich way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible, there\nbeing only one to change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, making his bosom big, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think no shame of a poverty\nI have come by in the service of my king; I make no secret that my\naffairs are quite involved; and for the moment, it would be even\nimpossible for me to undertake a journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil you have occasion to communicate with your friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps it might be convenient for you (as of course it would be\nhonourable to myself) if you were to regard yourself in the light of my\nguest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen an offer is frankly made, I think I honour myself\nmost to imitate that frankness.  Your hand, Mr. David; you have the\ncharacter that I respect the most; you are one of those from whom a\ngentleman can take a favour and no more words about it.  I am an old\nsoldier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on, looking rather disgusted-like around my chamber,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand you need not fear I shall prove burthensome.  I have ate too often\nat a dyke-side, drank of the ditch, and had no roof but the rain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be telling you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat our breakfasts are sent\ncustomarily in about this time of morning.  I propose I should go now to\nthe tavern, and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal the\nmatter of an hour, which will give you an interval to meet your daughter\nin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMethought his nostrils wagged at this.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, an hour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is\nperhaps superfluous.  Half an hour, Mr. David, or say twenty minutes; I\nshall do very well in that.  And by the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he adds, detaining me by\nthe coat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is it you drink in the morning, whether ale or wine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be frank with you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI drink nothing else but spare,\ncold water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTut-tut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is fair destruction to the stomach, take an old\ncampaigner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word for it.  Our country spirit at home is perhaps the most\nentirely wholesome; but as that is not come-at-able, Rhenish or a white\nwine of Burgundy will be next best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall make it my business to see you are supplied,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, very good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we shall make a man of you yet, Mr.\nDavid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time, I can hardly say that I was minding him at all, beyond an\nodd thought of the kind of father-in-law that he was like to prove; and\nall my cares centred about the lass his daughter, to whom I determined to\nconvey some warning of her visitor.  I stepped to the door accordingly,\nand cried through the panels, knocking thereon at the same time: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss\nDrummond, here is your father come at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that I went forth upon my errand, having (by two words)\nextraordinarily damaged my affairs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE THREESOME\n\n\nWhether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps pitied, I\nmust leave others to judge.  My shrewdness (of which I have a good deal,\ntoo) seems not so great with the ladies.  No doubt, at the moment when I\nawaked her, I was thinking a good deal of the effect upon James More; and\nsimilarly when I returned and we were all sat down to breakfast, I\ncontinued to behave to the young lady with deference and distance; as I\nstill think to have been most wise.  Her father had cast doubts upon the\ninnocence of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to allay.\nBut there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also.  We had shared in a\nscene of some tenderness and passion, and given and received caresses: I\nhad thrust her from me with violence; I had called aloud upon her in the\nnight from the one room to the other; she had passed hours of wakefulness\nand weeping; and it is not to be supposed I had been absent from her\npillow thoughts.  Upon the back of this, to be awaked, with unaccustomed\nformality, under the name of Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth used\nwith a great deal of distance and respect, led her entirely in error on\nmy private sentiments; and she was indeed so incredibly abused as to\nimagine me repentant and trying to draw off!\n\nThe trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that whereas I (since I\nhad first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly of James More, his\nreturn and suspicions, she made so little of these that I may say she\nscarce remarked them, and all her troubles and doings regarded what had\npassed between us in the night before.  This is partly to be explained by\nthe innocence and boldness of her character; and partly because James\nMore, having sped so ill in his interview with me, or had his mouth\nclosed by my invitation, said no word to her upon the subject.  At the\nbreakfast, accordingly, it soon appeared we were at cross purposes.  I\nhad looked to find her in clothes of her own: I found her (as if her\nfather were forgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for\nher, and which she knew (or thought) that I admired her in.  I had looked\nto find her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most precise and\nformal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes\nextraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression, calling me by\nname with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring and deferring to\nmy thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected wife.\n\nBut this was not for long.  As I behold her so regardless of her own\ninterests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring to recover, I\nredoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson to the girl.  The\nmore she came forward, the farther I drew back; the more she betrayed the\ncloseness of our intimacy, the more pointedly civil I became, until even\nher father (if he had not been so engrossed with eating) might have\nobserved the opposition.  In the midst of which, of a sudden, she became\nwholly changed, and I told myself, with a good deal of relief, that she\nhad took the hint at last.\n\nAll day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and though the\nhour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands, I cannot say but I\nwas happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in proper\nkeeping, the father satisfied or at least acquiescent, and myself free to\nprosecute my love with honour.  At supper, as at all our meals, it was\nJames More that did the talking.  No doubt but he talked well if anyone\ncould have believed him.  But I will speak of him presently more at\nlarge.  The meal at an end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as\nI thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad.  I took this for a hint\nthat I was to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who had\nscarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes upon me wide\nopen with a look that bade me stay.  I stood between them like a fish out\nof water, turning from one to the other; neither seemed to observe me,\nshe gazing on the floor, he buttoning his coat: which vastly swelled my\nembarrassment.  This appearance of indifference argued, upon her side, a\ngood deal of anger very near to burst out.  Upon his, I thought it\nhorribly alarming; I made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and\nconsidering that to be the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself\n(so to speak) in the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I do anything for _you_, Mr. Drummond?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.\n\nHe stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Mr.\nDavid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince you are so obliging as to propose it, you might\nshow me the way to a certain tavern\u00e2\u0080\u009d (of which he gave the name) \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere I\nhope to fall in with some old companions in arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear him company.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd as for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d say he to his daughter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou had best go to your bed.\nI shall be late home, and _Early to bed and early to rise_, _gars bonny\nlasses have bright eyes_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered me\nbefore him from the door.  This was so done (I thought on purpose) that\nit was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation; but I\nobserved she did not look at me, and set it down to terror of James More.\n\nIt was some distance to that tavern.  He talked all the way of matters\nwhich did not interest me the smallest, and at the door dismissed me with\nempty manners.  Thence I walked to my new lodging, where I had not so\nmuch as a chimney to hold me warm, and no society but my own thoughts.\nThese were still bright enough; I did not so much as dream that Catriona\nwas turned against me; I thought we were like folk pledged; I thought we\nhad been too near and spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by\nwhat were only steps in a most needful policy.  And the chief of my\nconcern was only the kind of father-in-law that I was getting, which was\nnot at all the kind I would have chosen: and the matter of how soon I\nought to speak to him, which was a delicate point on several sides.  In\nthe first place, when I thought how young I was I blushed all over, and\ncould almost have found it in my heart to have desisted; only that if\nonce I let them go from Leyden without explanation, I might lose her\naltogether.  And in the second place, there was our very irregular\nsituation to be kept in view, and the rather scant measure of\nsatisfaction I had given James More that morning.  I concluded, on the\nwhole, that delay would not hurt anything, yet I would not delay too long\nneither; and got to my cold bed with a full heart.\n\nThe next day, as James More seemed a little on the complaining hand in\nthe matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture; and coming\nin the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and tables, found the girl\nonce more left to herself.  She greeted me on my admission civilly, but\nwithdrew at once to her own room, of which she shut the door.  I made my\ndisposition, and paid and dismissed the men so that she might hear them\ngo, when I supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to me.  I\nwaited yet awhile, then knocked upon her door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nThe door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out, that I\nthought she must have stood behind it listening.  She remained there in\nthe interval quite still; but she had a look that I cannot put a name on,\nas of one in a bitter trouble.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre we not to have our walk to-day either?\u00e2\u0080\u009d so I faltered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thanking you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not be caring much to walk, now\nthat my father is come home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd do you think that was very kindly said?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not unkindly meant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ails you, Catriona?  What\nhave I done to you that you should turn from me like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not turn from you at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, speaking very carefully.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwill ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be\nhis friend in all that I am able.  But now that my father James More is\ncome again, there is a difference to be made, and I think there are some\nthings said and done that would be better to be forgotten.  But I will\never be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all that . . . .\nif it is not so much . . . . Not that you will be caring!  But I\nwould not have you think of me too hard.  It was true what you said to\nme, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember\nI was just a child.  I would not like to lose your friendship, at all\nevents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood was in her\nface like scarlet, so that not her words only, but her face and the\ntrembling of her very hands, besought me to be gentle.  I saw, for the\nfirst time, how very wrong I had done to place the child in that\nposition, where she had been entrapped into a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness, and now\nstood before me like a person shamed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning once\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you could see into my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would read\nthere that my respect is undiminished.  If that were possible, I should\nsay it was increased.  This is but the result of the mistake we made; and\nhad to come; and the less said of it now the better.  Of all of our life\nhere, I promise you it shall never pass my lips; I would like to promise\nyou too that I would never think of it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a memory that will be\nalways dear to me.  And as for a friend, you have one here that would die\nfor you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thanking you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\nWe stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get the upper\nhand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble, and my love lost,\nand myself alone again in the world as at the beginning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall be friends always, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certain thing.  But\nthis is a kind of farewell, too: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of a farewell after all; I\nshall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a farewell to my Catriona.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed to grow\ngreat and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose I must have lost\nmy head, for I called out her name again and made a step at her with my\nhands reached forth.\n\nShe shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood\nsprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed back upon my own\nheart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern.  I found no words to\nexcuse myself, but bowed before her very deep, and went my ways out of\nthe house with death in my bosom.\n\nI think it was about five days that followed without any change.  I saw\nher scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company of James\nMore.  If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my devoir to behave\nthe more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having always\nin my mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming in a\nblush, and in my heart more pity for her than I could depict in words.  I\nwas sorry enough for myself, I need not dwell on that, having fallen all\nmy length and more than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I\nwas near as sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with\nher save by fits and starts.  Her plea was good; she had been placed in\nan unfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more\nthan was to have been looked for.\n\nAnd for another thing she was now very much alone.  Her father, when he\nwas by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very easy led away by\nhis affairs and pleasures, neglected her without compunction or remark,\nspent his nights in taverns when he had the money, which was more often\nthan I could at all account for; and even in the course of these few\ndays, failed once to come to a meal, which Catriona and I were at last\ncompelled to partake of without him.  It was the evening meal, and I left\nimmediately that I had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be\nalone; to which she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I quite believed\nher.  Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the girl, and a reminder\nof a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness that she now abhorred to think of.  So she must\nsit alone in that room where she and I had been so merry, and in the\nblink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many difficult and\ntender moments.  There she must sit alone, and think of herself as of a\nmaid who had most unmaidenly proffered her affections and had the same\nrejected.  And in the meanwhile I would be alone some other place, and\nreading myself (whenever I was tempted to be angry) lessons upon human\nfrailty and female delicacy.  And altogether I suppose there were never\ntwo poor fools made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception.\n\nAs for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything in nature\nbut his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk.  Before twelve\nhours were gone he had raised a small loan of me; before thirty, he had\nasked for a second and been refused.  Money and refusal he took with the\nsame kind of high good nature.  Indeed, he had an outside air of\nmagnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon a daughter; and the\nlight in which he was constantly presented in his talk, and the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfine presence and great ways went together pretty harmoniously.  So that\na man that had no business with him, and either very little penetration\nor a furious deal of prejudice, might almost have been taken in.  To me,\nafter my first two interviews, he was as plain as print; I saw him to be\nperfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in the same; and I would\nhearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and \u00e2\u0080\u009can old soldier,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ca\npoor Highland gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe strength of my country and my\nfriends\u00e2\u0080\u009d) as I might to the babbling of a parrot.\n\nThe odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself, or\ndid at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce knew\nwhen he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection must have\nbeen wholly genuine.  There were times when he would be the most silent,\naffectionate, clinging creature possible, holding Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand like a\nbig baby, and begging of me not to leave if I had any love to him; of\nwhich, indeed, I had none, but all the more to his daughter.  He would\npress and indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk, a thing very\ndifficult in the state of our relations; and again break forth in\npitiable regrets for his own land and friends, or into Gaelic singing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed it is to make\na near friend of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the notes of this singing are in my\nblood, and the words come out of my heart.  And when I mind upon my red\nmountains and the wild birds calling there, and the brave streams of\nwater running down, I would scarce think shame to weep before my\nenemies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Then he would sing again, and translate to me pieces of the\nsong, with a great deal of boggling and much expressed contempt against\nthe English language.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt says here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the sun is\ngone down, and the battle is at an end, and the brave chiefs are\ndefeated.  And it tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange\ncountries or lying dead on the red mountain; and they will never more\nshout the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley.\nBut if you had only some of this language, you would weep also because\nthe words of it are beyond all expression, and it is mere mockery to tell\nyou it in English.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWell, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business, one way\nand another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for which I hated him,\nI think, the worst of all.  And it used to cut me to the quick to see\nCatriona so much concerned for the old rogue, and weeping herself to see\nhim weep, when I was sure one half of his distress flowed from his last\nnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking in some tavern.  There were times when I was tempted to\nlend him a round sum, and see the last of him for good; but this would\nhave been to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I was scarcely\nso prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to squander my\ngood money on one who was so little of a husband.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\u00e2\u0080\u0094A TWOSOME\n\n\nI believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that James was\nin one of his fits of gloom, when I received three letters.  The first\nwas from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden; the other two were out of\nScotland and prompted by the same affair, which was the death of my uncle\nand my own complete accession to my rights.  Rankeillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was, of course,\nwholly in the business view; Miss Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was like herself, a little more\nwitty than wise, full of blame to me for not having written (though how\nwas I to write with such intelligence?) and of rallying talk about\nCatriona, which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence.\n\nFor it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when I came to\ndinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first moment\nof reading it.  This made a welcome diversion for all three of us, nor\ncould any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued.  It was\naccident that brought the three letters the same day, and that gave them\ninto my hand in the same room with James More; and of all the events that\nflowed from that accident, and which I might have prevented if I had held\nmy tongue, the truth is that they were preordained before Agricola came\ninto Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels.\n\nThe first that I opened was naturally Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and what more natural than\nthat I should comment on his design to visit me? but I observed James to\nsit up with an air of immediate attention.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ninquired.\n\nI told him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it was the same; and he withheld me some time from my\nother letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manner of life in\nFrance, of which I knew very little, and further of his visit as now\nproposed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll we forfeited folk hang a little together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nbesides I know the gentleman: and though his descent is not the thing,\nand indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart, he was very\nmuch admired in the day of Drummossie.  He did there like a soldier; if\nsome that need not be named had done as well, the upshot need not have\nbeen so melancholy to remember.  There were two that did their best that\nday, and it makes a bond between the pair of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nI could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him, and could\nalmost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired a little\nfurther into that mention of his birth.  Though, they tell me, the same\nwas indeed not wholly regular.\n\nMeanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and could not withhold an\nexclamation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father was\narrived, to address her by a handle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am come into my kingdom fairly, I\nam the laird of Shaws indeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094my uncle is dead at last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe clapped her hands together leaping from her seat.  The next moment it\nmust have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was left\nto either, and we stood opposite, staring on each other sadly.\n\nBut James showed himself a ready hypocrite.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy daughter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis\nthis how my cousin learned you to behave?  Mr. David has lost a new\nfriend, and we should first condole with him on his bereavement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTroth, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can make no\nsuch great faces.  His death is as blithe news as ever I got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says James.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the way of flesh,\nwe must all go, all go.  And if the gentleman was so far from your\nfavour, why, very well!  But we may at least congratulate you on your\naccession to your estates.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor can I say that either,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, with the same heat.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a\ngood estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already?  I\nhad a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeath\u00e2\u0080\u0094which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I see not how\nanyone is to be bettered by this change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are more affected than you let on, or you\nwould never make yourself out so lonely.  Here are three letters; that\nmeans three that wish you well; and I could name two more, here in this\nvery chamber.  I have known you not so very long, but Catriona, when we\nare alone, is never done with the singing of your praises.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off at once into\nanother matter, the extent of my estate, which (during the most of the\ndinner time) he continued to dwell upon with interest.  But it was to no\npurpose he dissembled; he had touched the matter with too gross a hand:\nand I knew what to expect.  Dinner was scarce ate when he plainly\ndiscovered his designs.  He reminded Catriona of an errand, and bid her\nattend to it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not see you should be one beyond the hour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand friend David will be good enough to bear me company till you\nreturn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She made haste to obey him without words.  I do not know if she\nunderstood, I believe not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat\nstrengthening my mind for what should follow.\n\nThe door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man leaned back\nin his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness.  Only\nthe one thing betrayed him, and that was his face; which suddenly shone\nall over with fine points of sweat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am rather glad to have a word alone with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause in\nour first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and I\nhave long meant to set you right upon.  My daughter stands beyond doubt.\nSo do you, and I would make that good with my sword against all\ngainsayers.  But, my dear David, this world is a censorious place\u00e2\u0080\u0094as who\nshould know it better than myself, who have lived ever since the days of\nmy late departed father, God sain him! in a perfect spate of calumnies?\nWe have to face to that; you and me have to consider of that; we have to\nconsider of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo what effect, Mr. Drummond?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would be obliged to you if\nyou would approach your point.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike your character, indeed! and what I\nmost admire in it.  But the point, my worthy fellow, is sometimes in a\nkittle bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He filled a glass of wine.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThough between you and me,\nthat are such fast friends, it need not bother us long.  The point, I\nneed scarcely tell you, is my daughter.  And the first thing is that I\nhave no thought in my mind of blaming you.  In the unfortunate\ncircumstances, what could you do else?  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Deed, and I cannot tell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, pretty close upon my guard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have besides studied your character,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour talents are\nfair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no harm; and one\nthing with another, I am very happy to have to announce to you that I\nhave decided on the latter of the two ways open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am afraid I am dull,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ways are these?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your\ncondition; either that I should cut your throat or that you should marry\nmy daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are pleased to be quite plain at last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I believe I have been plain from the beginning!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he\nrobustiously.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank God, a\npatient and deleeborate man.  There is many a father, sir, that would\nhave hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field.  My esteem for\nyour character\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have any esteem for me at all, I\nwill beg of you to moderate your voice.  It is quite needless to rowt at\na gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best\nattention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, very true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, with an immediate change.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you must\nexcuse the agitations of a parent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand you then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I continued\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I will take no note of your\nother alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let fall\u00e2\u0080\u0094I understand\nyou rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for\nyour daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not possible to express my meaning better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I see we\nshall do well together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat remains to be yet seen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut so much I need make no\nsecret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection,\nand I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune than to get\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, and reached\nout his hand to me.\n\nI put it by.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go too fast, Mr. Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are\nconditions to be made; and there is a difficulty in the path, which I see\nnot entirely how we shall come over.  I have told you that, upon my side,\nthere is no objection to the marriage, but I have good reason to believe\nthere will be much on the young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is all beside the mark,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will engage for her\nacceptance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you forget, Mr. Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat, even in dealing with\nmyself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable expressions.  I\nwill have none such employed to the young lady.  I am here to speak and\nthink for the two of us; and I give you to understand that I would no\nmore let a wife be forced upon myself, than what I would let a husband be\nforced on the young lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that is to be the way of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I concluded.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will marry Miss\nDrummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing.  But if there be\nthe least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear\u00e2\u0080\u0094marry her will I\nnever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a small affair.  As soon as she returns I\nwill sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I cut in again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I cry off,\nand you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge.  I shall satisfy\nmyself exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle\u00e2\u0080\u0094you the least of all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand who are you to be the judge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bridegroom, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is to quibble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou turn your back upon the fact.  The\ngirl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise.  Her character is\ngone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I ask your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut while this matter lies between her\nand you and me, that is not so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat security have I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I to let my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation\ndepend upon a chance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should have thought of all this long ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbefore you were\nso misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when it is quite too\nlate.  I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect,\nand I will be browbeat by no man living.  My mind is quite made up, and\ncome what may, I will not depart from it a hair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breadth.  You and me\nare to sit here in company till her return: upon which, without either\nword or look from you, she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk.\nIf she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step, I will then make\nit; and if she cannot, I will not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe leaped out of his chair like a man stung.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can spy your man\u00c5\u0093uvre,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would work upon her to refuse!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe ay, and maybe no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the way it is to be,\nwhatever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I refuse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nWhat with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which he came\nnear rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons, I did not\nuse this word without trepidation, to say nothing at all of the\ncircumstance that he was Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father.  But I might have spared\nmyself alarms.  From the poorness of my lodging\u00e2\u0080\u0094he does not seem to have\nremarked his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dresses, which were indeed all equally new to\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094and from the fact that I had shown myself averse to lend, he had\nembraced a strong idea of my poverty.  The sudden news of my estate\nconvinced him of his error, and he had made but the one bound of it on\nthis fresh venture, to which he was now so wedded, that I believe he\nwould have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of\nfighting.\n\nA little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until I hit upon a\nword that silenced him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmust suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about\nher unwillingness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gabbled some kind of an excuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\nthink we would do better to preserve a judicious silence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose would have\ncut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view us.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\u00e2\u0080\u0094IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE\n\n\nI opened the door to Catriona and stopped her on the threshold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father wishes us to take our walk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nShe looked to James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained\nsoldier, she turned to go with me.\n\nWe took one of our old ways, where we had gone often together, and been\nmore happy than I can tell of in the past.  I came a half a step behind,\nso that I could watch her unobserved.  The knocking of her little shoes\nupon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad; and I thought it a\nstrange moment that I should be so near both ends of it at once, and walk\nin the midst between two destinies, and could not tell whether I was\nhearing these steps for the last time, or whether the sound of them was\nto go in and out with me till death should part us.\n\nShe avoided even to look at me, only walked before her, like one who had\na guess of what was coming.  I saw I must speak soon before my courage\nwas run out, but where to begin I knew not.  In this painful situation,\nwhen the girl was as good as forced into my arms and had already besought\nmy forbearance, any excess of pressure must have seemed indecent; yet to\navoid it wholly would have a very cold-like appearance.  Between these\nextremes I stood helpless, and could have bit my fingers; so that, when\nat last I managed to speak at all, it may be said I spoke at random.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am in a very painful situation; or rather, so we\nare both; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you would promise\nto let me speak through first of all, and not to interrupt me till I have\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe promised me that simply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis that I have got to say is very difficult, and I\nknow very well I have no right to be saying it.  After what passed\nbetween the two of us last Friday, I have no manner of right.  We have\ngot so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I know very well the least\nI could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I intended fully,\nand there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you\nagain.  But, my dear, it has become merely necessary, and no way by it.\nYou see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes of me rather a\nbetter match; and the\u00e2\u0080\u0094the business would not have quite the same\nridiculous-like appearance that it would before.  Besides which, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsupposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying)\nthat it would be better to let them be the way they are.  In my view,\nthis part of the thing is vastly exagerate, and if I were you I would not\nwear two thoughts on it.  Only it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right I should mention the same,\nbecause there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt it has some influence on James More.  Then I\nthink we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before.\nI think we did pretty well together.  If you would look back, my dear\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will look neither back nor forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she interrupted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me the\none thing: this is my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe approves of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe approved I that I should ask your hand\nin marriage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was going on again with somewhat more of an appeal upon\nher feelings; but she marked me not, and struck into the midst.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe told you to!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is no sense denying it, you said\nyourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts.  He told you\nto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I began.\n\nShe was walking ever the faster, and looking fain in front of her; but at\nthis she made a little noise in her head, and I thought she would have\nrun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout which,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter what you said last Friday, I would\nnever have been so troublesome as make the offer.  But when he as good as\nasked me, what was I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stopped and turned round upon me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is refused at all events,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand there will be an end\nof that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she began again to walk forward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose I could expect no better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I think you might try\nto be a little kind to me for the last end of it.  I see not why you\nshould be harsh.  I have loved you very well, Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0094no harm that I\nshould call you so for the last time.  I have done the best that I could\nmanage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no\nbetter.  It is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to be\nhard to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not thinking of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am thinking of that man, my\nfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and that way, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can be of use to you that way,\ntoo; I will have to be.  It is very needful, my dear, that we should\nconsult about your father; for the way this talk has gone, an angry man\nwill be James More.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stopped again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is because I am disgraced?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is what he is thinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have told you already to\nmake nought of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be all one to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI prefer to be disgraced!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI did not know very well what to answer, and stood silent.\n\nThere seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last cry;\npresently she broke out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what is the meaning of all this?  Why is\nall this shame loundered on my head?  How could you dare it, David\nBalfour?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat else was I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not your dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I defy you to be calling me these\nwords.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not thinking of my words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy heart bleeds for you, Miss\nDrummond.  Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your difficult\nposition.  But there is just the one thing that I wish you would bear in\nview, if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly; for there is\ngoing to be a collieshangie when we two get home.  Take my word for it,\nit will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  There sprang a patch of red in either of her cheeks.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas he for fighting you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he was that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\nShe gave a dreadful kind of laugh.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt all events, it is complete!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried.  And then turning on me.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father and I are a fine pair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am thanking the good God there will be somebody worse than\nwhat we are.  I am thanking the good God that he has let me see you so.\nThere will never be the girl made that will not scorn you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was over the mark.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have no right to speak to me like that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have I done\nbut to be good to you, or try to be?  And here is my repayment!  O, it is\ntoo much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe kept looking at me with a hateful smile.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe word in your throat and in your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have dared\nhim this day already in your interest.  I will dare him again, the nasty\npole-cat; little I care which of us should fall!  Come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cback to\nthe house with us; let us be done with it, let me be done with the whole\nHieland crew of you!  You will see what you think when I am dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head at me with that same smile I could have struck her\nfor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, smile away!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have seen your bonny father smile on the\nwrong side this day.  Not that I mean he was afraid, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added\nhastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut he preferred the other way of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I offered to draw with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou offered to draw upon James More!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I did so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand found him backward enough, or how would we\nbe here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a meaning upon this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it you are meaning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was to make you take me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I would not have it.  I\nsaid you should be free, and I must speak with you alone; little I\nsupposed it would be such a speaking!  \u00e2\u0080\u0098_And what if I refuse_?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nhe.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Then it must come to the throat-cutting_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098_for I will no\nmore have a husband forced on that young lady_, _than what I would have a\nwife forced upon myself_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  These were my words, they were a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwords; bonnily have I paid for them!  Now you have refused me of your own\nclear free will, and there lives no father in the Highlands, or out of\nthem, that can force on this marriage.  I will see that your wishes are\nrespected; I will make the same my business, as I have all through.  But\nI think you might have that decency as to affect some gratitude.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Deed,\nand I thought you knew me better!  I have not behaved quite well to you,\nbut that was weakness.  And to think me a coward, and such a coward as\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0094O, my lass, there was a stab for the last of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie, how would I guess?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, this is a dreadful business!\nMe and mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094she gave a kind of a wretched cry at the word\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cme and mine\nare not fit to speak to you.  O, I could be kneeling down to you in the\nstreet, I could be kissing your hands for forgiveness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will keep the kisses I have got from you already,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\nkeep the ones I wanted and that were something worth; I will not be\nkissed in penitence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can you be thinking of this miserable girl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I am trying to tell you all this while!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you had best\nleave me alone, whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried, and turn\nyour attention to James More, your father, with whom you are like to have\na queer pirn to wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried, and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut trouble\nyourself no more for that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe does not know what kind of\nnature is in my heart.  He will pay me dear for this day of it; dear,\ndear, will he pay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned, and began to go home and I to accompany her.  At which she\nstopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be going alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is alone I must be seeing him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome little time I raged about the streets, and told myself I was the\nworst used lad in Christendom.  Anger choked me; it was all very well for\nme to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to\nsupply me, and I thought I would have burst like a man at the bottom of\nthe sea.  I stopped and laughed at myself at a street corner a minute\ntogether, laughing out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which\nbrought me to myself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy long\nenough.  Time it was done.  Here is a good lesson to have nothing to do\nwith that accursed sex, that was the ruin of the man in the beginning and\nwill be so to the end.  God knows I was happy enough before ever I saw\nher; God knows I can be happy enough again when I have seen the last of\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat seemed to me the chief affair: to see them go.  I dwelled upon the\nidea fiercely; and presently slipped on, in a kind of malevolence, to\nconsider how very poorly they were likely to fare when Davie Balfour was\nno longer by to be their milk-cow; at which, to my very own great\nsurprise, the disposition of my mind turned bottom up.  I was still\nangry; I still hated her; and yet I thought I owed it to myself that she\nshould suffer nothing.\n\nThis carried me home again at once, where I found the mails drawn out and\nready fastened by the door, and the father and daughter with every mark\nupon them of a recent disagreement.  Catriona was like a wooden doll;\nJames More breathed hard, his face was dotted with white spots, and his\nnose upon one side.  As soon as I came in, the girl looked at him with a\nsteady, clear, dark look that might have been followed by a blow.  It was\na hint that was more contemptuous than a command, and I was surprised to\nsee James More accept it.  It was plain he had had a master talking-to;\nand I could see there must be more of the devil in the girl than I had\nguessed, and more good humour about the man than I had given him the\ncredit of.\n\nHe began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly speaking from a\nlesson; but he got not very far, for at the first pompous swell of his\nvoice, Catriona cut in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you what James More is meaning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe means we\nhave come to you, beggar-folk, and have not behaved to you very well, and\nwe are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill-behaviour.  Now we are wanting\nto go away and be forgotten; and my father will have guided his gear so\nill, that we cannot even do that unless you will give us some more alms.\nFor that is what we are, at an events, beggar-folk and sorners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy your leave, Miss Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must speak to your father by\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went into her own room and shut the door, without a word or a look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says James More.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has no\ndelicacy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not here to discuss that with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut to be quit of you.\nAnd to that end I must talk of your position.  Now, Mr. Drummond, I have\nkept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for.  I know\nyou had money of your own when you were borrowing mine.  I know you have\nhad more since you were here in Leyden, though you concealed it even from\nyour daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI bid you beware.  I will stand no more baiting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke out.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nsick of her and you.  What kind of a damned trade is this to be a parent!\nI have had expressions used to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  There he broke off.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, this is\nthe heart of a soldier and a parent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on again, laying his hand\non his bosom, \u00e2\u0080\u009coutraged in both characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I bid you beware.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you would have let me finish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would have found I spoke\nfor your advantage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know I might have relied upon the\ngenerosity of your character.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan! will you let me speak?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is that I cannot win to\nfind out if you are rich or poor.  But it is my idea that your means, as\nthey are mysterious in their source, so they are something insufficient\nin amount; and I do not choose your daughter to be lacking.  If I durst\nspeak to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it\nto you; because I know you like the back of my hand, and all your\nblustering talk is that much wind to me.  However, I believe in your way\nyou do still care something for your daughter after all; and I must just\nbe doing with that ground of confidence, such as it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhereupon, I arranged with him that he was to communicate with me, as to\nhis whereabouts and Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s welfare, in consideration of which I was\nto serve him a small stipend.\n\nHe heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness; and when it was\ndone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear fellow, my dear son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is more like\nyourself than any of it yet!  I will serve you with a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfaithfulness\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me hear no more of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have got me to that pitch that\nthe bare name of soldier rises on my stomach.  Our traffic is settled; I\nam now going forth and will return in one half-hour, when I expect to\nfind my chambers purged of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear that I might see\nCatriona again, because tears and weakness were ready in my heart, and I\ncherished my anger like a piece of dignity.  Perhaps an hour went by; the\nsun had gone down, a little wisp of a new moon was following it across a\nscarlet sunset; already there were stars in the east, and in my chambers,\nwhen at last I entered them, the night lay blue.  I lit a taper and\nreviewed the rooms; in the first there remained nothing so much as to\nawake a memory of those who were gone; but in the second, in a corner of\nthe floor, I spied a little heap that brought my heart into my mouth.\nShe had left behind at her departure all that she had ever had of me.  It\nwas the blow that I felt sorest, perhaps because it was the last; and I\nfell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more foolish than I\ncare to tell of.\n\nLate in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering, I came\nagain by some portion of my manhood and considered with myself.  The\nsight of these poor frocks and ribbons, and her shifts, and the clocked\nstockings, was not to be endured; and if I were to recover any constancy\nof mind, I saw I must be rid of them ere the morning.  It was my first\nthought to have made a fire and burned them; but my disposition has\nalways been opposed to wastery, for one thing; and for another, to have\nburned these things that she had worn so close upon her body seemed in\nthe nature of a cruelty.  There was a corner cupboard in that chamber;\nthere I determined to bestow them.  The which I did and made it a long\nbusiness, folding them with very little skill indeed but the more care;\nand sometimes dropping them with my tears.  All the heart was gone out of\nme, I was weary as though I had run miles, and sore like one beaten;\nwhen, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore often at her neck, I\nobserved there was a corner neatly cut from it.  It was a kerchief of a\nvery pretty hue, on which I had frequently remarked; and once that she\nhad it on, I remembered telling her (by way of a banter) that she wore my\ncolours.  There came a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness in my\nbosom; and the next moment I was plunged back in a fresh despair.  For\nthere was the corner crumpled in a knot and cast down by itself in\nanother part of the floor.\n\nBut when I argued with myself, I grew more hopeful.  She had cut that\ncorner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender; that she\nhad cast it away again was little to be wondered at; and I was inclined\nto dwell more upon the first than upon the second, and to be more pleased\nthat she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake, than concerned\nbecause she had flung it from her in an hour of natural resentment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\u00e2\u0080\u0094WE MEET IN DUNKIRK\n\n\nAltogether, then, I was scare so miserable the next days but what I had\nmany hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with a good deal of\nconstancy upon my studies; and made out to endure the time till Alan\nshould arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James\nMore.  I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation.  One\nwas to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France, from\nwhich place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission.\nThis was to England and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been a\nbitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same.\nBut he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de\u00e2\u0080\u0099il, or James More\neither.  During this absence, the time was to fall due for another\nletter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend, he had been\nso careful as to prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be\ndespatched.  The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions, and\nhe was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal.  What I received began\naccordingly in the writing of James More:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have to\n    acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement.  It shall be all\n    faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires to be\n    remembered to her dear friend.  I find her in rather a melancholy\n    disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her re-established.\n    Our manner of life is very much alone, but we solace ourselves with\n    the melancholy tunes of our native mountains, and by walking up the\n    margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland.  It was better days\n    with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of\n    Gladsmuir.  I have found employment here in the _haras_ of a French\n    nobleman, where my experience is valued.  But, my dear Sir, the wages\n    are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention\n    them, which makes your remittances the more necessary to my\n    daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comfort, though I daresay the sight of old friends would\n    be still better.\n\n                                                             \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Sir,\n                                     \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour affectionate, obedient servant,\n                                               \u00e2\u0080\u009cJAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBelow it began again in the hand of Catriona:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not be believing him, it is all lies together,\u00e2\u0080\u0094C. M. D.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNot only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have come near\nsuppressing the letter; for it came long after date, and was closely\nfollowed by the third.  In the time betwixt them, Alan had arrived, and\nmade another life to me with his merry conversation; I had been presented\nto his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more than I could have\nthought possible and was not otherwise of interest; I had been\nentertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself, all with no\ngreat change upon my sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself,\nand not at all the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my\nrelations with James More and his daughter.  I was naturally diffident to\ngive particulars; and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the\nnature of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commentary upon those I gave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannae make heed nor tail of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it sticks in my\nmind ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a gowk of yourself.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s few people that has had more\nexperience than Alan Breck: and I can never call to mind to have heard\ntell of a lassie like this one of yours.  The way that you tell it, the\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair impossible.  Ye must have made a terrible hash of the\nbusiness, David.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are whiles that I am of the same mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Alan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest kind, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take it to my grave\nwith me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, ye beat me, whatever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would conclude.\n\nI showed him the letter with Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s postscript.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd here again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona, and sense\nforby!  As for James More, the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as boss as a drum; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a wame\nand a wheen words; though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can never deny that he fought reasonably\nwell at Gladsmuir, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true what he says here about the five wounds.\nBut the loss of him is that the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit goes against the grain with me to leave the\nmaid in such poor hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe couldnae weel find poorer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what are ye to do with\nit?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk\nhave got no kind of reason to them.  Either they like the man, and then\na\u00e2\u0080\u0099 goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your\nbreath\u00e2\u0080\u0094ye can do naething.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the two sets of them\u00e2\u0080\u0094them that\nwould sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\non.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral\nthat ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true for me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naething easier!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could easy learn ye\nthe science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born blind, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwhere the deefficulty comes in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd can _you_ no help me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou that are so clever at the\ntrade?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe see, David, I wasnae here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like a field officer that\nhas naebody but blind men for scouts and _\u00c3\u00a9claireurs_; and what would he\nken?  But it sticks in my mind that ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have made some kind of bauchle;\nand if I was you I would have a try at her again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould ye so, man Alan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would e\u00e2\u0080\u0099en\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\nThe third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk:\nand it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion.  James professed to\nbe in some concern upon his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, which I believe was never\nbetter; abounded in kind expressions to myself; and finally proposed that\nI should visit them at Dunkirk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nwrote.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not accompany him so far in his return to France?  I have\nsomething very particular for Mr. Stewart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear; and, at any rate, I\nwould be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier and one so mettle\nas himself.  As for you, my dear sir, my daughter and I would be proud to\nreceive our benefactor, whom we regard as a brother and a son.  The\nFrench nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of\ncharacter, and I have been necessitate to leave the _haras_.  You will\nfind us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the _auberge_ of a man\nBazin on the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make no doubt but\nwe might spend some very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I could\nrecall our services, and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a\nmanner more befitting your age.  I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would\ncome here; my business with him opens a very wide door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does the man want with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alan, when he had read.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat he\nwants with you is clear enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s siller.  But what can he want with\nAlan Breck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cO, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be just an excuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is still after this marriage,\nwhich I wish from my heart that we could bring about.  And he asks you\nbecause he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I wish that I kent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHim and me were never onyways\npack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Something for my\near,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll maybe have something for his hinder-end, before\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re through with it.  Dod, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking it would be a kind of\ndivertisement to gang and see what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be after!  Forby that I could\nsee your lassie then.  What say ye, Davie?  Will ye ride with Alan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou may be sure I was not backward, and Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s furlough running towards\nan end, we set forth presently upon this joint adventure.\n\nIt was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of\nDunkirk.  We left our horses at the post, and found a guide to Bazin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nInn, which lay beyond the walls.  Night was quite fallen, so that we were\nthe last to leave that fortress, and heard the doors of it close behind\nus as we passed the bridge.  On the other side there lay a lighted\nsuburb, which we thridded for a while, then turned into a dark lane, and\npresently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we\ncould hear a bullering of the sea.  We travelled in this fashion for some\nwhile, following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I\nhad begun to think he was perhaps misleading us, when we came to the top\nof a small brae, and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a\nwindow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Voil\u00c3\u00a0 l\u00e2\u0080\u0099auberge \u00c3\u00a0 Bazin_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the guide.\n\nAlan smacked his lips.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn unco lonely bit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, and I thought by\nhis tone he was not wholly pleased.\n\nA little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house, which was\nall in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the chambers at the\nside, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking fire at the one end of\nit, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-trap at the other.  Here Bazin,\nwho was an ill-looking, big man, told us the Scottish gentleman was gone\nabroad he knew not where, but the young lady was above, and he would call\nher down to us.\n\nI took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted it\nabout my throat.  I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting me on the\nshoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain\nfrom a sharp word.  But the time was not long to wait.  I heard her step\npass overhead, and saw her on the stair.  This she descended very\nquietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of\nearnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father, James More, will be here soon.  He will be very pleased to\nsee you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.  And then of a sudden her face flamed, her eyes\nlightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure she had\nobserved the kerchief.  It was only for a breath that she was\ndiscomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to\nwelcome Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you will be his friend, Alan Breck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you; and I love\nyou already for all your bravery and goodness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand so\nthis is the young lady at the last of it!  David, ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an awful poor\nhand of a description.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearts;\nthe sound of his voice was like song.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? will he have been describing me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle else of it since I ever came out of France!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cforby a\nbit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by\nSilvermills.  But cheer up, my dear! ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bonnier than what he said.\nAnd now there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing sure; you and me are to be a pair of friends.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a kind of a henchman to Davie here; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m like a tyke at his heels; and\nwhatever he cares for, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to care for too\u00e2\u0080\u0094and by the holy airn!\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to care for me!  So now you can see what way you stand with\nAlan Breck, and ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hardly lose on the transaction.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no\nvery bonnie, my dear, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leal to them he loves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thank you from my heart for your good words,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have that\nhonour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any to be answering\nwith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUsing travellers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 freedom, we spared to wait for James More, and sat down\nto meat, we threesome.  Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon his\nwants: he made her drink first out of his glass, he surrounded her with\ncontinual kind gallantries, and yet never gave me the most small occasion\nto be jealous; and he kept the talk so much in his own hand, and that in\nso merry a note, that neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed.  If\nany had seen us there, it must have been supposed that Alan was the old\nfriend and I the stranger.  Indeed, I had often cause to love and to\nadmire the man, but I never loved or admired him better than that night;\nand I could not help remarking to myself (what I was sometimes rather in\ndanger of forgetting) that he had not only much experience of life, but\nin his own way a great deal of natural ability besides.  As for Catriona,\nshe seemed quite carried away; her laugh was like a peal of bells, her\nface gay as a May morning; and I own, although I was well pleased, yet I\nwas a little sad also, and thought myself a dull, stockish character in\ncomparison of my friend, and very unfit to come into a young maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life,\nand perhaps ding down her gaiety.\n\nBut if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was not alone\nin it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl was changed into a\npiece of stone.  Through the rest of that evening, until she made an\nexcuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon her without cease; and I\ncan bear testimony that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked mostly\non the board in front of her.  So that I really marvelled to see so much\ndevotion (as it used to be) changed into the very sickness of hate.\n\nOf James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man already,\nwhat there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing out his lies.\nEnough that he drank a great deal, and told us very little that was to\nany possible purpose.  As for the business with Alan, that was to be\nreserved for the morrow and his private hearing.\n\nIt was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty weary\nwith four day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ride, and sat not very late after Catriona.\n\nWe were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with a single\nbed.  Alan looked on me with a queer smile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe muckle ass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do ye mean by that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMean?  What do I mean!  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extraordinar, David man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d say he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you\nshould be so mortal stupit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain I begged him to speak out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told ye there were the two kinds of\nwomen\u00e2\u0080\u0094them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the others.  Just you\ntry for yoursel, my bonny man!  But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that neepkin at your craig?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI told him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thocht it was something thereabout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nNor would he say another word though I besieged him long with\nimportunities.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP\n\n\nDaylight showed us how solitary the inn stood.  It was plainly hard upon\nthe sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every side with scabbit\nhills of sand.  There was, indeed, only one thing in the nature of a\nprospect, where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill,\nlike an ass\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears, but with the ass quite hidden.  It was strange (after\nthe wind rose, for at first it was dead calm) to see the turning and\nfollowing of each other of these great sails behind the hillock.  Scarce\nany road came by there; but a number of footways travelled among the\nbents in all directions up to Mr. Bazin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door.  The truth is, he was a\nman of many trades, not any one of them honest, and the position of his\ninn was the best of his livelihood.  Smugglers frequented it; political\nagents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await\ntheir passages; and I daresay there was worse behind, for a whole family\nmight have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser.\n\nI slept little and ill.  Long ere it was day, I had slipped from beside\nmy bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro\nbefore the door.  Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little after, sprang up\na wind out of the west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun, and\nset the mill to the turning.  There was something of spring in the\nsunshine, or else it was in my heart; and the appearing of the great\nsails one after another from behind the hill, diverted me extremely.  At\ntimes I could hear a creak of the machinery; and by half-past eight of\nthe day, and I thought this dreary, desert place was like a paradise.\n\nFor all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began to be\naware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain.  It seemed there was\ntrouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came up and went down\nover the hill, were like persons spying; and outside of all fancy, it was\nsurely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought\nto dwell in.\n\nAt breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James More was in\nsome danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was alive to the same, and\nwatched him close; and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side,\nand vigilance upon the other, held me on live coals.  The meal was no\nsooner over than James seemed to come began to make apologies.  He had an\nappointment of a private nature in the town (it was with the French\nnobleman, he told me), and we would please excuse him till about noon.\nMeanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room, where\nhe seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with much\ninclination.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am caring less and less about this man James,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsomething no right with the man James, and I shouldnae wonder but what\nAlan Breck would give an eye to him this day.  I would like fine to see\nyon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay you could find an employ to\nyoursel, and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your\naffair.  Just tell it to her plainly\u00e2\u0080\u0094tell her ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a muckle ass at the\noff-set; and then, if I were you, and ye could do it naitural, I would\njust mint to her I was in some kind of a danger; a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 weemenfolk likes\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I, mocking him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more fool you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen ye\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can tell her that I\nrecommended it; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae wonder\nbut what that was the next best.  But see to the pair of them!  If I\ndidnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was awful pleased and\nchief with Alan, I would think there was some kind of hocus-pocus about\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe thinks a heap of me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no like you: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m one that\ncan tell.  That she does\u00e2\u0080\u0094she thinks a heap of Alan.  And troth! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nthinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your permission, Shaws, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can see what way James\ngoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast table;\nJames to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs to her own\nchamber.  I could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone\nwith me; yet was none the better pleased with it for that, and bent my\nmind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned.  Upon the\nwhole, the best appeared to me to do like Alan.  If I was out of view\namong the sandhills, the fine morning would decoy her forth; and once I\nhad her in the open, I could please myself.\n\nNo sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a hillock\nbefore she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there, and (seeing\nnobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward, and by which I\nfollowed her.  I was in no haste to make my presence known; the further\nshe went I made sure of the longer hearing to my suit; and the ground\nbeing all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard.  The path rose and\ncame at last to the head of a knowe.  Thence I had a picture for the\nfirst time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in; where\nwas no man to be seen, nor any house of man, except just Bazin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the\nwindmill.  Only a little further on, the sea appeared and two or three\nships upon it, pretty as a drawing.  One of these was extremely close in\nto be so great a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion,\nwhen I recognised the trim of the _Seahorse_.  What should an English\nship be doing so near in to France?  Why was Alan brought into her\nneighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue? and\nwas it by accident, or by design, that the daughter of James More should\nwalk that day to the seaside?\n\nPresently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills and above\nthe beach.  It was here long and solitary; with a man-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-war\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boat drawn\nup about the middle of the prospect, and an officer in charge and pacing\nthe sands like one who waited.  I sat down where the rough grass a good\ndeal covered me, and looked for what should follow.  Catriona went\nstraight to the boat; the officer met her with civilities; they had ten\nwords together; I saw a letter changing hands; and there was Catriona\nreturning.  At the same time, as if this were all her business on the\nContinent, the boat shoved off and was headed for the _Seahorse_.  But I\nobserved the officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents.\n\nI liked the business little; and the more I considered of it, liked it\nless.  Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona?  She drew near\nwith her head down, looking constantly on the sand, and made so tender a\npicture that I could not bear to doubt her innocence.  The next, she\nraised her face and recognised me; seemed to hesitate, and then came on\nagain, but more slowly, and I thought with a changed colour.  And at that\nthought, all else that was upon my bosom\u00e2\u0080\u0094fears, suspicions, the care of\nmy friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life\u00e2\u0080\u0094was clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood\nwaiting her in a drunkenness of hope.\n\nI gave her \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she came up, which she returned with a good\ndeal of composure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you forgive my having followed you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you are always meaning kindly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied; and then, with a\nlittle outburst, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut why will you be sending money to that man!  It must\nnot be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never sent it for him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut for you, as you know well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavid, it is not right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not, it is all wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I pray God he will help this\ndull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better.  Catriona, this\nis no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your pardon for the word,\nbut yon man is no fit father to take care of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not be speaking of him, even!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her cry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am thinking, O,\nbe sure of that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think of the one thing.  I have been alone\nnow this long time in Leyden; and when I was by way of at my studies,\nstill I was thinking of that.  Next Alan came, and I went among\nsoldier-men to their big dinners; and still I had the same thought.  And\nit was the same before, when I had her there beside me.  Catriona, do you\nsee this napkin at my throat!  You cut a corner from it once and then\ncast it from you.  They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re _your_ colours now; I wear them in my heart.\nMy dear, I cannot be wanting you.  O, try to put up with me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTry to put up with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctry and bear me with a little.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStill she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me like a fear\nof death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, gazing on her hard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis it a mistake again?  Am I\nquite lost?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe raised her face to me, breathless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want me, Davie, truly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, and I scarce could hear her say\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, sure you know it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have nothing left to give or to keep back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was all\nyours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nThis was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and conspicuous, we\nwere to be seen there even from the English ship; but I kneeled down\nbefore her in the sand, and embraced her knees, and burst into that storm\nof weeping that I thought it must have broken me.  All thought was wholly\nbeaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure.  I knew not\nwhere I was.  I had forgot why I was happy; only I knew she stooped, and\nI felt her cherish me to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a\nwhirl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cO, Davie, is this what you think of me!  Is it\nso that you were caring for poor me!  O, Davie, Davie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect\ngladness.\n\nIt might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of what\na mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her, with her hands in\nmine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child,\nand called her foolish and kind names.  I have never seen the place that\nlooked so pretty as those bents by Dunkirk; and the windmill sails, as\nthey bobbed over the knowe, were like a tune of music.\n\nI know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else\nbesides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference to her father,\nwhich brought us to reality.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy little friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I was calling her again and again, rejoicing to\nsummon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on her, and to\nbe a little distant\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy little friend, now you are mine altogether; mine\nfor good, my little friend and that man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands from\nmine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDavie, take me away from him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something wrong;\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true.  There will be something wrong; I have a dreadful terror\nhere at my heart.  What will he be wanting at all events with that King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nship?  What will this word be saying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And she held the letter forth.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mind misgives me, it will be some ill to Alan.  Open it, Davie\u00e2\u0080\u0094open\nit and see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI took it, and looked at it, and shook my head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit goes against me, I cannot open a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot to save your friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannae tell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think not.  If I was only sure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you have but to break the seal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the thing goes against me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive it here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I will open it myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor you neither,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou least of all.  It concerns your father,\nand his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting.  No question but the\nplace is dangerous-like, and the English ship being here, and your father\nhaving word from it, and yon officer that stayed ashore.  He would not be\nalone either; there must be more along with him; I daresay we are spied\nupon this minute.  Ay, no doubt, the letter should be opened; but\nsomehow, not by you nor me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome with a\nsense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan, come back again\nfrom following James and walking by himself among the sand-hills.  He was\nin his soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat, of course, and mighty fine; but I could not avoid\nto shudder when I thought how little that jacket would avail him, if he\nwere once caught and flung in a skiff, and carried on board of the\n_Seahorse_, a deserter, a rebel, and now a condemned murderer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is the man that has the best right to open it: or\nnot, as he thinks fit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be a mark for\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is so\u00e2\u0080\u0094if it be more disgrace\u00e2\u0080\u0094will you can bear it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked,\nlooking upon me with a burning eye.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the\nonce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think I answered?  That if I liked you as I\nthought I did\u00e2\u0080\u0094and O, but I like you better!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would marry you at his\ngallows\u00e2\u0080\u0099 foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon me,\nholding my hand: and it was so that we awaited Alan.\n\nHe came with one of his queer smiles.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was I telling ye, David?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsays he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a time for all things, Alan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand this time is\nserious.  How have you sped?  You can speak out plain before this friend\nof ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been upon a fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI doubt we have done better than you, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand, at least,\nhere is a great deal of matter that you must judge of.  Do you see that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nI went on, pointing to the ship.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the _Seahorse_, Captain\nPalliser.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should ken her, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had fyke enough with her when she\nwas stationed in the Forth.  But what ails the man to come so close?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you why he came there first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was to bring this\nletter to James More.  Why he stops here now that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delivered, what\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be about, why there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an officer hiding in the bents, and\nwhether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probable that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would rather you\nconsidered for yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA letter to James More?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I can tell ye more than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the last\nnight, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing with some\none in the French, and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried I, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou slept all night, and I am here to prove it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nhe.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the business looks bad.  Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see the letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI gave it him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have to excuse me, my dear; but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing\nless than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to break this\nseal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my wish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catriona.\n\nHe opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe stinking brock!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get our things together.  This place is fair death to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAnd he began to walk towards the inn.\n\nIt was Catriona that spoke the first.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has sold you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSold me, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut thanks to you and Davie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll can\njink him yet.  Just let me win upon my horse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona must come with us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe can have no more traffic with\nthat man.  She and I are to be married.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  At which she pressed my hand to\nher side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre ye there with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, looking back.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work\nthat ever either of you did yet!  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m bound to say, my dawtie, ye\nmake a real, bonny couple.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill, where\nI was aware of a man in seaman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trousers, who seemed to be spying from\nbehind it.  Only, of course, we took him in the rear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, Alan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWheesht!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said, he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is my affairs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of the mill,\nand we got up close before he noticed.  Then he turned, and we saw he was\na big fellow with a mahogany face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you speak the English?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Non_, _monsieur_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, with an incredible bad accent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Non_, _monsieur_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Alan, mocking him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that how they learn\nyou French on the _Seahorse_?  Ye muckle, gutsey hash, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Scots\nboot to your English hurdies!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt the man a kick that\nlaid him on his nose.  Then he stood, with a savage smile, and watched\nhim scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand-hills.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high time I was clear of these empty bents!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan; and\ncontinued his way at top speed, and we still following, to the backdoor\nof Bazin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inn.\n\nIt chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with\nJames More entering by the other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I to Catriona, \u00e2\u0080\u009cquick! upstairs with you and make your\npackets; this is no fit scene for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long room.\nShe passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after she was some way\nup I saw her turn and glance at them again, though without pausing.\nIndeed, they were worth looking at.  Alan wore as they met one of his\nbest appearances of courtesy and friendliness, yet with something\neminently warlike, so that James smelled danger off the man, as folk\nsmell fire in a house, and stood prepared for accidents.\n\nTime pressed.  Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s situation in that solitary place, and his enemies\nabout him, might have daunted C\u00c3\u00a6sar.  It made no change in him; and it\nwas in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the interview.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll yon\nbusiness of yours be just about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, the thing being private, and rather of a long story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says James,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it will keep very well till we have eaten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m none so sure of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sticks in my mind it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either\nnow or never; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here have gotten a line,\nand we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking of the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI saw a little surprise in James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye; but he held himself stoutly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have but the one word to say to cure you of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that\nis the name of my business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay it then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHout! wha minds for Davie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a matter that would make us both rich men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you tell me that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries Alan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plain fact is that it is Cluny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nTreasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave ye got word of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis crowns all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I came to Dunkirk.\nAnd so this was your business, was it?  Halvers, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the business, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike interest,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit has naething to do with the _Seahorse_, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\npursued Alan.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHut, man! have done with your lees!  I have Palliser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter here in my pouch.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re by with it, James More.  You can never\nshow your face again with dacent folk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJames was taken all aback with it.  He stood a second, motionless and\nwhite, then swelled with the living anger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you talk to me, you bastard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he roared out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYe glee\u00e2\u0080\u0099d swine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet on the\nmouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together.\n\nAt the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back from the\ncollision.  The next I saw, James parried a thrust so nearly that I\nthought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfather, and in a manner almost my own, and I drew and ran in to sever\nthem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep back, Davie!  Are ye daft!  Damn ye, keep back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared Alan.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour blood be on your ain heid then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI beat their blades down twice.  I was knocked reeling against the wall;\nI was back again betwixt them.  They took no heed of me, thrusting at\neach other like two furies.  I can never think how I avoided being\nstabbed myself or stabbing one of these two Rodomonts, and the whole\nbusiness turned about me like a piece of a dream; in the midst of which I\nheard a great cry from the stair, and Catriona sprang before her father.\nIn the same moment the point of my sword encountered some thing yielding.\nIt came back to me reddened.  I saw the blood flow on the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nkerchief, and stood sick.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter after all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear, I have done with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alan, and went, and sat on a table,\nwith his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand.\n\nAwhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then swung\nsuddenly about and faced him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBegone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was her word, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake your shame out of my sight; leave me with\nclean folk.  I am a daughter of Alpin!  Shame of the sons of Alpin,\nbegone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own\nbloodied sword.  The two stood facing, she with the red stain on her\nkerchief, he white as a rag.  I knew him well enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew it must have\npierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he betook himself to a\nbravado air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright eye on\nAlan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cries James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJames More,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis lady daughter of yours is to marry my\nfriend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a hale carcase.\nBut take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way or\nower late.  Little as you suppose it, there are leemits to my temper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe damned, sir, but my money\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said James.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m vexed about that, too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alan, with his funny face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut now, ye\nsee, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mines.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And then with more gravity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe you advised, James\nMore, you leave this house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJames seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be\nthought he had enough of Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swordsmanship, for he suddenly put off\nhis hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned) bade us farewell\nin a series.  With which he was gone.\n\nAt the same time a spell was lifted from me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCatriona,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was me\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was my sword.  O, are you much hurt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it; it was done\ndefending that bad man, my father.  See!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and showed me a\nbleeding scratch, \u00e2\u0080\u009csee, you have made a man of me now.  I will carry a\nwound like an old soldier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJoy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave nature,\nsupported me.  I embraced her, I kissed the wound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says\nAlan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\ndear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a true daughter of Alpin.  By all accounts, he\nwas a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of you.  If ever I was to\nget married, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to my\nsons.  And I bear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name and speak the truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the girl,\nand through her, to me.  It seemed to wipe us clean of all James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisgraces.  And the next moment he was just himself again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now by your leave, my dawties,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 very bonny; but\nAlan Breck\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caring for;\nand Dod! I think this is a grand place to be leaving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe word recalled us to some wisdom.  Alan ran upstairs and returned with\nour saddle-bags and James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portmanteau; I picked up Catriona\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbundle where she had dropped it on the stair; and we were setting forth\nout of that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped the way with cries and\ngesticulations.  He had whipped under a table when the swords were drawn,\nbut now he was as bold as a lion.  There was his bill to be settled,\nthere was a chair broken, Alan had sat among his dinner things, James\nMore had fled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpay yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and flung him down some Lewie d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ors; for\nI thought it was no time to be accounting.\n\nHe sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into the\nopen.  Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in;\na little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to hurry them; and\nright behind him, like some foolish person holding up his hands, were the\nsails of the windmill turning.\n\nAlan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run.  He carried a\ngreat weight in James More\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portmanteau; but I think he would as soon\nhave lost his life as cast away that booty which was his revenge; and he\nran so that I was distressed to follow him, and marvelled and exulted to\nsee the girl bounding at my side.\n\nAs soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other side;\nand the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs.  We had a start\nof some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-legged tarpaulins\nafter all, that could not hope to better us at such an exercise.  I\nsuppose they were armed, but did not care to use their pistols on French\nground.  And as soon as I perceived that we not only held our advantage\nbut drew a little away, I began to feel quite easy of the issue.  For all\nwhich, it was a hot, brisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was\nstill far off; and when we popped over a knowe, and found a company of\nthe garrison marching on the other side on some man\u00c5\u0093uvre, I could very\nwell understand the word that Alan had.\n\nHe stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a real\nbonny folk, the French nation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nNo sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held a very\nnecessary council-of-war on our position.  We had taken a daughter from\nher father at the sword\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point; any judge would give her back to him at\nonce, and by all likelihood clap me and Alan into jail; and though we had\nan argument upon our side in Captain Palliser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter, neither Catriona\nnor I were very keen to be using it in public.  Upon all accounts it\nseemed the most prudent to carry the girl to Paris to the hands of her\nown chieftain, Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help\nhis kinswoman, on the one hand, and not at all anxious to dishonour James\nupon other.\n\nWe made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so good at the\nriding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle since the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Forty-five.  But we made it out at last, reached Paris early of a\nSabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance, to find\nBohaldie.  He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style, having a\npension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means; greeted Catriona\nlike one of his own house, and seemed altogether very civil and discreet,\nbut not particularly open.  We asked of the news of James More.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor\nJames!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, and shook his head and smiled, so that I thought he knew\nfurther than he meant to tell.  Then we showed him Palliser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter, and\nhe drew a long face at that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor James!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he again.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there are worse folk than James\nMore, too.  But this is dreadful bad.  Tut, tut, he must have forgot\nhimself entirely!  This is a most undesirable letter.  But, for all that,\ngentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make it public for.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nan ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are all Scots folk and all\nHieland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon the\nquestion of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands, as though\nthere had been no such person as James More, and gave Catriona away with\nvery pretty manners and agreeable compliments in French.  It was not till\nall was over, and our healths drunk, that he told us James was in that\ncity, whither he had preceded us some days, and where he now lay sick,\nand like to die.  I thought I saw by my wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face what way her\ninclination pointed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd let us go see him, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it is your pleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Catriona.  These were early days.\n\nHe was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief, in a great\nhouse upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret where he lay by\nthe sound of Highland piping.  It seemed he had just borrowed a set of\nthem from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness; though he was no such hand as\nwas his brother Rob, he made good music of the kind; and it was strange\nto observe the French folk crowding on the stairs, and some of them\nlaughing.  He lay propped in a pallet.  The first look of him I saw he\nwas upon his last business; and, doubtless, this was a strange place for\nhim to die in.  But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end with\npatience.  Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know we\nwere married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a benediction\nlike a patriarch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been never understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI forgive you both without an\nafterthought;\u00e2\u0080\u009d after which he spoke for all the world in his old manner,\nwas so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon his pipes, and borrowed\na small sum before I left.\n\nI could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour; but\nhe was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always fresh to him.  I think he\nforgave me every time we met; and when after some four days he passed\naway in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity, I could have torn my\nhair out for exasperation.  I had him buried; but what to put upon his\ntomb was quite beyond me, till at last I considered the date would look\nbest alone.\n\nI thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we had\nappeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly look strange\nto return in a new character.  Scotland would be doing for us; and\nthither, after I had recovered that which I had left behind, we sailed in\na Low Country ship.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nAnd now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and Mr. Alan\nBalfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly to an end.  A\ngreat many of the folk that took a part in it, you will find (if you\nthink well) that you have seen and spoken with.  Alison Hastie in\nLimekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too small to\nknow of it, and walked abroad with you in the policy when you were\nbigger.  That very fine great lady that is Miss Barbara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name-mamma is\nno other than the same Miss Grant that made so much a fool of David\nBalfour in the house of the Lord Advocate.  And I wonder whether you\nremember a little, lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig and a\nwraprascal, that came to Shaws very late of a dark night, and whom you\nwere awakened out of your beds and brought down to the dining-hall to be\npresented to, by the name of Mr. Jamieson?  Or has Alan forgotten what he\ndid at Mr. Jamieson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request\u00e2\u0080\u0094a most disloyal act\u00e2\u0080\u0094for which, by the\nletter of the law, he might be hanged\u00e2\u0080\u0094no less than drinking the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhealth _across the water_?  These were strange doings in a good Whig\nhouse!  But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to my\ncorn-barn; and the name they know him by now in France is the Chevalier\nStewart.\n\nAs for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in the next\ndays, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and mamma.  It\nis true we were not so wise as we might have been, and made a great deal\nof sorrow out of nothing; but you will find as you grow up that even the\nartful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant Mr. Alan, will be not so very\nmuch wiser than their parents.  For the life of man upon this world of\nours is a funny business.  They talk of the angels weeping; but I think\nthey must more often be holding their sides as they look on; and there\nwas one thing I determined to do when I began this long story, and that\nwas to tell out everything as it befell.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n{1}  Conspicuous.\n\n{2}  Country.\n\n{3}  The Fairies.\n\n{4}  Flatteries.\n\n{5}  Trust to.\n\n{6}  This must have reference to Dr. Cameron on his first visit.\u00e2\u0080\u0094D.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1310,"split":"test"}
