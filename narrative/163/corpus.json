{"ori_id":"25827f8dc98f34529b019ac26dda8ef7d76f241d","title":"The Man of Feeling","context":"The Man of Feeling\n The Man of Feeling details the fragmentary episodes of the life of Harley which exist within the remains of a manuscript traded to the initial narrator of the novel by a priest. The novel itself begins with these two latter figures hunting, whereas the manuscript is missing the first ten chapters and approximately thirty others at various locations throughout the manuscript's entirety.\nAs a young boy, Harley loses his parents and is assigned several guardians who constantly disagree with each other. They do however agree that he should make an effort to acquire more wealth, and so they urge him to make an old distant relative amiable towards him to claim some inheritance. Harley fails in this endeavour, as he doesn't cooperate with the relative's attempts to warm to him.\nHarley is then advised to acquire a patron; to sell his vote at an election for a lease of land. His neighbour Mr. Walton gives him a letter of introduction, and he leaves home (and Miss Walton) for London. He meets a beggar and his dog on the way, and after donating to them, hears the fortune-telling beggar's story.\nIn the following (missing) chapters, Harley formally visits the baronet Mr. Walton recommended him to, because when the narrative continues, Harley is calling on him for the second time. The baronet however is away from London, and Harley meets another gentleman named Tom. They go for a stroll and then dine together, discussing pensions and resources with two older men.\nHarley proceeds to visit Bedlam, and weeps for an inmate there, before dining with a scorned, cynical man and together they discuss honour and vanity. He then demonstrates his skill (or, as many argue, his lack of skill) in physiognomy by being charitable on behalf of an old gentleman, with whom Harley later plays cards. After losing money to them, Harley is informed the gentleman and his acquaintance are con men.\nApproached by a prostitute, Harley takes her to a tavern and feeds her, despite having to hand the waiter his pocket watch as collateral for paying the bill, and then meets again with her the next morning to hear her story. At its conclusion her father arrives, and after a misunderstanding is reconciled with his daughter. Jamie is then deemed the 'man of feeling' as a result of his loss of control over his emotions.\nUpon discovering that his claim for the land lease has failed, Harley takes a stage-coach back home, discussing poetry and vice with a fellow passenger until they part ways and the coach reaches the end of its route. Harley continues on foot, and along the way meets Edwards, an old farmer from his village who has fallen on hard times and is returning from his conscription in the army. Together they approach the village, to find the school house destroyed, and two orphans who are actually the grandchildren of Harley's companion. Harley takes the three of them home, and provides some land for them.\nAfter discussing corrupt military commanders with Edwards, Harley is informed to his dismay that Miss Walton is going to be married to Sir Harry Benson.\nThe Man of Feeling then jumps to an unconnected tale of a man named Mountford, who journeys to Milan as tutor to the young Sedley, where they meet with a count. They visit a debtors' prison to find a man and his family living there at the behest of the count's son, a man who had been so charming to the two gentlemen. Sedley pays the family's debt, and then Mountford and Sedley leave Milan in disgust.\nThe narrative returns to the story of Harley. Miss Walton has not married Benson. She visits an unwell Harley (who has contracted a fever nursing Edwards and his grandchildren), who confesses his love to her. They hold hands and he dies.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Man of Feeling, by Henry Mackenzie,\nEdited by Henry Morley\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

After education in the University of Edinburgh he went to London\nin 1765, at the age of twenty, for law studies, returned to Edinburgh,\nand became Crown Attorney in the Scottish Court of Exchequer.  When\nMackenzie was in London, Sterne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTristram Shandy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was in course of\npublication.  The first two volumes had appeared in 1759, and the ninth\nappeared in 1767, followed in 1768, the year of Sterne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, by \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nSentimental Journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Young Mackenzie had a strong bent towards\nliterature, and while studying law in London, he read Sterne, and falling\nin with the tone of sentiment which Sterne himself caught from the spirit\nof the time and the example of Rousseau, he wrote \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Man of Feeling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis book was published, without author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, in 1771.  It was so\npopular that a young clergyman made a copy of it popular with imagined\npassages of erasure and correction, on the strength of which he claimed\nto be its author, and obliged Henry Mackenzie to declare himself.  In\n1773 Mackenzie published a second novel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Man of the World,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and in\n1777 a third, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJulia de Roubign\u00c3\u00a9.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  An essay-reading society in\nEdinburgh, of which he was a leader, started in January, 1779, a weekly\npaper called _The Mirror_, which he edited until May, 1780.  Its writers\nafterwards joined in producing _The Lounger_, which lasted from February,\n1785, to January, 1787.  Henry Mackenzie contributed forty-two papers to\n_The Mirror_ and fifty-seven to _The Lounger_.  When the Royal Society of\nEdinburgh was founded Henry Mackenzie was active as one of its first\nmembers.  He was also one of the founders of the Highland Society.\n\nAlthough his \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan of Feeling\u00e2\u0080\u009d was a serious reflection of the false\nsentiment of the Revolution, Mackenzie joined afterwards in writing\ntracts to dissuade the people from faith in the doctrines of the\nRevolutionists.  Mackenzie wrote also a tragedy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Prince of Tunis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwhich was acted with success at Edinburgh, and a comedy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe White\nHypocrite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was acted once only at Covent garden.  He died at the\nage of eighty-six, on the 13th June, 1831, having for many years been\nregarded as an elder friend of their own craft by the men of letters who\nin his days gave dignity to Edinburgh society, and caused the town to be\ncalled the Modern Athens.\n\nA man of refined taste, who caught the tone of the French sentiment of\nhis time, has, of course, pleased French critics, and has been translated\ninto French.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Man of Feeling\u00e2\u0080\u009d begins with imitation of Sterne, and\nproceeds in due course through so many tears that it is hardly to be\ncalled a dry book.  As guide to persons of a calculating disposition who\nmay read these pages I append an index to the Tears shed in \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Man of\nFeeling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nINDEX TO TEARS.\n\n\n                   (_Chokings_, _&c._, _not counted_.)\n\n                                                                  PAGE\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOdds but should have wept\u00e2\u0080\u009d                                       xiii\nTear, given, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccordial drop\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated                                17\n,, like Cestus of Cytherea                                          26\n,, one on a cheek                                                   30\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not weep\u00e2\u0080\u009d                                                   31\nTears add energy to benediction                                     31\n,, tribute of some                                                  52\n\u00e2\u0080\u009e blessings on                                                      52\nI would weep too                                                    52\nNot an unmoistened eye                                              53\nDo you weep again?                                                  53\nHand bathed with tears                                              53\nTears, burst into                                                   54\n\u00e2\u0080\u009e sobbing and shedding                                              74\n,, burst into                                                       75\n,, virtue in these                                                  75\n\u00e2\u0080\u009e he wept at the recollection of her                                80\n,, glister of new-washed                                            81\nSweet girl (here she wept)                                          94\nI could only weep                                                   95\nTears, saw his                                                      97\n,, burst into                                                       99\n\u00e2\u0080\u009e wrung from the heart                                              99\n,, feet bathed with                                                100\n,, mingled, _i.e._, his with hers                                  100\n\u00e2\u0080\u009e voice lost in                                                    108\nEye met with a tear                                                108\nTear stood in eye                                                  127\nTears, face bathed with                                            130\nDropped one tear, no more                                          131\nTears, press-gang could scarce keep from                           136\nBig drops wetted gray beard                                        137\nTears, shower of                                                   138\n,, scarce forced\u00e2\u0080\u0094blubbered like a boy                              139\nMoistened eye                                                      141\nTears choked utterance                                             144\nI have wept many a time                                            144\nGirl wept, brother sobbed                                          145\nHarley kissed off her tears as they flowed, and wept between       145\nevery kiss\nTears flowing down cheeks                                          148\n,, gushed afresh                                                   148\nBeamy moisture                                                     154\nA tear dropped                                                     165\nTear in her eye, the sick man kissed it off in its bud,            176\nsmiling through the dimness of his own\nHand wet by tear just fallen                                       185\nTears flowing without control                                      187\nCheek wiped (at the end of the last chapter)                       189\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S INTRODUCTION\n\n\nMY dog had made a point on a piece of fallow-ground, and led the curate\nand me two or three hundred yards over that and some stubble adjoining,\nin a breathless state of expectation, on a burning first of September.\n\nIt was a false point, and our labour was vain: yet, to do Rover justice\n(for he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an excellent dog, though I have lost his pedigree), the fault\nwas none of his, the birds were gone: the curate showed me the spot where\nthey had lain basking, at the root of an old hedge.\n\nI stopped and cried Hem!  The curate is fatter than I; he wiped the sweat\nfrom his brow.\n\nThere is no state where one is apter to pause and look round one, than\nafter such a disappointment.  It is even so in life.  When we have been\nhurrying on, impelled by some warm wish or other, looking neither to the\nright hand nor to the left\u00e2\u0080\u0094we find of a sudden that all our gay hopes are\nflown; and the only slender consolation that some friend can give us, is\nto point where they were once to be found.  And lo! if we are not of that\ncombustible race, who will rather beat their heads in spite, than wipe\ntheir brows with the curate, we look round and say, with the nauseated\nlistlessness of the king of Israel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll is vanity and vexation of\nspirit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked round with some such grave apophthegm in my mind when I\ndiscovered, for the first time, a venerable pile, to which the enclosure\nbelonged.  An air of melancholy hung about it.  There was a languid\nstillness in the day, and a single crow, that perched on an old tree by\nthe side of the gate, seemed to delight in the echo of its own croaking.\n\nI leaned on my gun and looked; but I had not breath enough to ask the\ncurate a question.  I observed carving on the bark of some of the trees:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099twas indeed the only mark of human art about the place, except that some\nbranches appeared to have been lopped, to give a view of the cascade,\nwhich was formed by a little rill at some distance.\n\nJust at that instant I saw pass between the trees a young lady with a\nbook in her hand.  I stood upon a stone to observe her; but the curate\nsat him down on the grass, and leaning his back where I stood, told me,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman of the name of WALTON,\nwhom he had seen walking there more than once.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome time ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone HARLEY lived there, a whimsical sort of\nman I am told, but I was not then in the cure; though, if I had a turn\nfor those things, I might know a good deal of his history, for the\ngreatest part of it is still in my possession.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis history!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, you may call it what you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\ncurate; for indeed it is no more a history than it is a sermon.  The way\nI came by it was this: some time ago, a grave, oddish kind of a man\nboarded at a farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in this parish: the country people called him The\nGhost; and he was known by the slouch in his gait, and the length of his\nstride.  I was but little acquainted with him, for he never frequented\nany of the clubs hereabouts.  Yet for all he used to walk a-nights, he\nwas as gentle as a lamb at times; for I have seen him playing at teetotum\nwith the children, on the great stone at the door of our churchyard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon after I was made curate, he left the parish, and went nobody knows\nwhither; and in his room was found a bundle of papers, which was brought\nto me by his landlord.  I began to read them, but I soon grew weary of\nthe task; for, besides that the hand is intolerably bad, I could never\nfind the author in one strain for two chapters together; and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbelieve there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a single syllogism from beginning to end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be glad to see this medley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall see it now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered the curate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I always take it along with me a-shooting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow came it so torn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis excellent wadding,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the curate.\u00e2\u0080\u0094This\nwas a plea of expediency I was not in a condition to answer; for I had\nactually in my pocket great part of an edition of one of the German\nIllustrissimi, for the very same purpose.  We exchanged books; and by\nthat means (for the curate was a strenuous logician) we probably saved\nboth.\n\nWhen I returned to town, I had leisure to peruse the acquisition I had\nmade: I found it a bundle of little episodes, put together without art,\nand of no importance on the whole, with something of nature, and little\nelse in them.  I was a good deal affected with some very trifling\npassages in it; and had the name of Marmontel, or a Richardson, been on\nthe title-page\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis odds that I should have wept: But\n\nOne is ashamed to be pleased with the works of one knows not whom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. {15}\nON BASHFULNESS.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A CHARACTER.\u00e2\u0080\u0094HIS OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT.\n\n\nTHERE is some rust about every man at the beginning; though in some\nnations (among the French for instance) the ideas of the inhabitants,\nfrom climate, or what other cause you will, are so vivacious, so\neternally on the wing, that they must, even in small societies, have a\nfrequent collision; the rust therefore will wear off sooner: but in\nBritain it often goes with a man to his grave; nay, he dares not even pen\na _hic jacet_ to speak out for him after his death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them rub it off by travel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, who was a\nstriking instance of excellent metal, shamefully rusted.  I had drawn my\nchair near his.  Let me paint the honest old man: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis but one passing\nsentence to preserve his image in my mind.\n\nHe sat in his usual attitude, with his elbow rested on his knee, and his\nfingers pressed on his cheek.  His face was shaded by his hand; yet it\nwas a face that might once have been well accounted handsome; its\nfeatures were manly and striking, a dignity resided on his eyebrows,\nwhich were the largest I remember to have seen.  His person was tall and\nwell-made; but the indolence of his nature had now inclined it to\ncorpulency.\n\nHis remarks were few, and made only to his familiar friends; but they\nwere such as the world might have heard with veneration: and his heart,\nuncorrupted by its ways, was ever warm in the cause of virtue and his\nfriends.\n\nHe is now forgotten and gone!  The last time I was at Silton Hall, I saw\nhis chair stand in its corner by the fire-side; there was an additional\ncushion on it, and it was occupied by my young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite lap dog.\nI drew near unperceived, and pinched its ears in the bitterness of my\nsoul; the creature howled, and ran to its mistress.  She did not suspect\nthe author of its misfortune, but she bewailed it in the most pathetic\nterms; and kissing its lips, laid it gently on her lap, and covered it\nwith a cambric handkerchief.  I sat in my old friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat; I heard the\nroar of mirth and gaiety around me: poor Ben Silton!  I gave thee a tear\nthen: accept of one cordial drop that falls to thy memory now.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey should wear it off by travel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, it is true, said I, that will\ngo far; but then it will often happen, that in the velocity of a modern\ntour, and amidst the materials through which it is commonly made, the\nfriction is so violent, that not only the rust, but the metal too, is\nlost in the progress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me leave to correct the expression of your metaphor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr.\nSilton: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is not always rust which is acquired by the inactivity of\nthe body on which it preys; such, perhaps, is the case with me, though\nindeed I was never cleared from my youth; but (taking it in its first\nstage) it is rather an encrustation, which nature has given for purposes\nof the greatest wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I returned; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand sometimes, like certain precious\nfossils, there may be hid under it gems of the purest brilliancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, farther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Mr. Silton, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are two distinct sorts of\nwhat we call bashfulness; this, the awkwardness of a booby, which a few\nsteps into the world will convert into the pertness of a coxcomb; that, a\nconsciousness, which the most delicate feelings produce, and the most\nextensive knowledge cannot always remove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom the incidents I have already related, I imagine it will be concluded\nthat Harley was of the latter species of bashful animals; at least, if\nMr. Silton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principle is just, it may be argued on this side; for the\ngradation of the first mentioned sort, it is certain, he never attained.\nSome part of his external appearance was modelled from the company of\nthose gentlemen, whom the antiquity of a family, now possessed of bare\n\u00c2\u00a3250 a year, entitled its representative to approach: these indeed were\nnot many; great part of the property in his neighbourhood being in the\nhands of merchants, who had got rich by their lawful calling abroad, and\nthe sons of stewards, who had got rich by their lawful calling at home:\npersons so perfectly versed in the ceremonial of thousands, tens of\nthousands, and hundreds of thousands (whose degrees of precedency are\nplainly demonstrable from the first page of the Complete Accomptant, or\nYoung Man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Best Pocket Companion) that a bow at church from them to such\na man as Harley would have made the parson look back into his sermon for\nsome precept of Christian humility.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\nOF WORLDLY INTERESTS.\n\n\nTHERE are certain interests which the world supposes every man to have,\nand which therefore are properly enough termed worldly; but the world is\napt to make an erroneous estimate: ignorant of the dispositions which\nconstitute our happiness or misery, they bring to an undistinguished\nscale the means of the one, as connected with power, wealth, or grandeur,\nand of the other with their contraries.  Philosophers and poets have\noften protested against this decision; but their arguments have been\ndespised as declamatory, or ridiculed as romantic.\n\nThere are never wanting to a young man some grave and prudent friends to\nset him right in this particular, if he need it; to watch his ideas as\nthey arise, and point them to those objects which a wise man should never\nforget.\n\nHarley did not want for some monitors of this sort.  He was frequently\ntold of men whose fortunes enabled them to command all the luxuries of\nlife, whose fortunes were of their own acquirement: his envy was invited\nby a description of their happiness, and his emulation by a recital of\nthe means which had procured it.\n\nHarley was apt to hear those lectures with indifference; nay, sometimes\nthey got the better of his temper; and as the instances were not always\namiable, provoked, on his part, some reflections, which I am persuaded\nhis good-nature would else have avoided.\n\nIndeed, I have observed one ingredient, somewhat necessary in a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncomposition towards happiness, which people of feeling would do well to\nacquire; a certain respect for the follies of mankind: for there are so\nmany fools whom the opinion of the world entitles to regard, whom\naccident has placed in heights of which they are unworthy, that he who\ncannot restrain his contempt or indignation at the sight will be too\noften quarrelling with the disposal of things to relish that share which\nis allotted to himself.  I do not mean, however, to insinuate this to\nhave been the case with Harley; on the contrary, if we might rely on his\nown testimony, the conceptions he had of pomp and grandeur served to\nendear the state which Providence had assigned him.\n\nHe lost his father, the last surviving of his parents, as I have already\nrelated, when he was a boy.  The good man, from a fear of offending, as\nwell as a regard to his son, had named him a variety of guardians; one\nconsequence of which was, that they seldom met at all to consider the\naffairs of their ward; and when they did meet, their opinions were so\nopposite, that the only possible method of conciliation was the mediatory\npower of a dinner and a bottle, which commonly interrupted, not ended,\nthe dispute; and after that interruption ceased, left the consulting\nparties in a condition not very proper for adjusting it.  His education\ntherefore had been but indifferently attended to; and after being taken\nfrom a country school, at which he had been boarded, the young gentleman\nwas suffered to be his own master in the subsequent branches of\nliterature, with some assistance from the parson of the parish in\nlanguages and philosophy, and from the exciseman in arithmetic and\nbook-keeping.  One of his guardians, indeed, who, in his youth, had been\nan inhabitant of the Temple, set him to read Coke upon Lyttelton: a book\nwhich is very properly put into the hands of beginners in that science,\nas its simplicity is accommodated to their understandings, and its size\nto their inclination.  He profited but little by the perusal; but it was\nnot without its use in the family: for his maiden aunt applied it\ncommonly to the laudable purpose of pressing her rebellious linens to the\nfolds she had allotted them.\n\nThere were particularly two ways of increasing his fortune, which might\nhave occurred to people of less foresight than the counsellors we have\nmentioned.  One of these was, the prospect of his succeeding to an old\nlady, a distant relation, who was known to be possessed of a very large\nsum in the stocks: but in this their hopes were disappointed; for the\nyoung man was so untoward in his disposition, that, notwithstanding the\ninstructions he daily received, his visits rather tended to alienate than\ngain the good-will of his kinswoman.  He sometimes looked grave when the\nold lady told the jokes of her youth; he often refused to eat when she\npressed him, and was seldom or never provided with sugar-candy or\nliquorice when she was seized with a fit of coughing: nay, he had once\nthe rudeness to fall asleep while she was describing the composition and\nvirtues of her favourite cholic-water.  In short, be accommodated himself\nso ill to her humour, that she died, and did not leave him a farthing.\n\nThe other method pointed out to him was an endeavour to get a lease of\nsome crown-lands, which lay contiguous to his little paternal estate.\nThis, it was imagined, might be easily procured, as the crown did not\ndraw so much rent as Harley could afford to give, with very considerable\nprofit to himself; and the then lessee had rendered himself so obnoxious\nto the ministry, by the disposal of his vote at an election, that he\ncould not expect a renewal.  This, however, needed some interest with the\ngreat, which Harley or his father never possessed.\n\nHis neighbour, Mr. Walton, having heard of this affair, generously\noffered his assistance to accomplish it.  He told him, that though he had\nlong been a stranger to courtiers, yet he believed there were some of\nthem who might pay regard to his recommendation; and that, if he thought\nit worth the while to take a London journey upon the business, he would\nfurnish him with a letter of introduction to a baronet of his\nacquaintance, who had a great deal to say with the first lord of the\ntreasury.\n\nWhen his friends heard of this offer, they pressed him with the utmost\nearnestness to accept of it.\n\nThey did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a certain degree\nof spirit and assurance gives a man who would make a figure in the world:\nthey repeated their instances of good fortune in others, ascribed them\nall to a happy forwardness of disposition; and made so copious a recital\nof the disadvantages which attend the opposite weakness, that a stranger,\nwho had heard them, would have been led to imagine, that in the British\ncode there was some disqualifying statute against any citizen who should\nbe convicted of\u00e2\u0080\u0094modesty.\n\nHarley, though he had no great relish for the attempt, yet could not\nresist the torrent of motives that assaulted him; and as he needed but\nlittle preparation for his journey, a day, not very distant, was fixed\nfor his departure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\nTHE MAN OF FEELING IN LOVE.\n\n\nTHE day before that on which he set out, he went to take leave of Mr.\nWalton.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We would conceal nothing;\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was another person of the family\nto whom also the visit was intended, on whose account, perhaps, there\nwere some tenderer feelings in the bosom of Harley than his gratitude for\nthe friendly notice of that gentleman (though he was seldom deficient in\nthat virtue) could inspire.  Mr. Walton had a daughter; and such a\ndaughter! we will attempt some description of her by and by.\n\nHarley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notions of the \u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00b1\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00bf\u00ce\u00bd, or beautiful, were not always to be\ndefined, nor indeed such as the world would always assent to, though we\ncould define them.  A blush, a phrase of affability to an inferior, a\ntear at a moving tale, were to him, like the Cestus of Cytherea,\nunequalled in conferring beauty.  For all these Miss Walton was\nremarkable; but as these, like the above-mentioned Cestus, are perhaps\nstill more powerful when the wearer is possessed of some degree of\nbeauty, commonly so called, it happened, that, from this cause, they had\nmore than usual power in the person of that young lady.\n\nShe was now arrived at that period of life which takes, or is supposed to\ntake, from the flippancy of girlhood those sprightlinesses with which\nsome good-natured old maids oblige the world at three-score.  She had\nbeen ushered into life (as that word is used in the dialect of St.\nJames\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) at seventeen, her father being then in parliament, and living in\nLondon: at seventeen, therefore, she had been a universal toast; her\nhealth, now she was four-and-twenty, was only drank by those who knew her\nface at least.  Her complexion was mellowed into a paleness, which\ncertainly took from her beauty; but agreed, at least Harley used to say\nso, with the pensive softness of her mind.  Her eyes were of that gentle\nhazel colour which is rather mild than piercing; and, except when they\nwere lighted up by good-humour, which was frequently the case, were\nsupposed by the fine gentlemen to want fire.  Her air and manner were\nelegant in the highest degree, and were as sure of commanding respect as\ntheir mistress was far from demanding it.  Her voice was inexpressibly\nsoft; it was, according to that incomparable simile of Otway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009clike the shepherd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipe upon the mountains,\n    When all his little flock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at feed before him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe effect it had upon Harley, himself used to paint ridiculously enough;\nand ascribed it to powers, which few believed, and nobody cared for.\n\nHer conversation was always cheerful, but rarely witty; and without the\nsmallest affectation of learning, had as much sentiment in it as would\nhave puzzled a Turk, upon his principles of female materialism, to\naccount for.  Her beneficence was unbounded; indeed the natural\ntenderness of her heart might have been argued, by the frigidity of a\ncasuist, as detracting from her virtue in this respect, for her humanity\nwas a feeling, not a principle: but minds like Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s are not very apt\nto make this distinction, and generally give our virtue credit for all\nthat benevolence which is instinctive in our nature.\n\nAs her father had some years retired to the country, Harley had frequent\nopportunities of seeing her.  He looked on her for some time merely with\nthat respect and admiration which her appearance seemed to demand, and\nthe opinion of others conferred upon her from this cause, perhaps, and\nfrom that extreme sensibility of which we have taken frequent notice,\nHarley was remarkably silent in her presence.  He heard her sentiments\nwith peculiar attention, sometimes with looks very expressive of\napprobation; but seldom declared his opinion on the subject, much less\nmade compliments to the lady on the justness of her remarks.\n\nFrom this very reason it was that Miss Walton frequently took more\nparticular notice of him than of other visitors, who, by the laws of\nprecedency, were better entitled to it: it was a mode of politeness she\nhad peculiarly studied, to bring to the line of that equality, which is\never necessary for the ease of our guests, those whose sensibility had\nplaced them below it.\n\nHarley saw this; for though he was a child in the drama of the world, yet\nwas it not altogether owing to a want of knowledge on his part; on the\ncontrary, the most delicate consciousness of propriety often kindled that\nblush which marred the performance of it: this raised his esteem\nsomething above what the most sanguine descriptions of her goodness had\nbeen able to do; for certain it is, that notwithstanding the laboured\ndefinitions which very wise men have given us of the inherent beauty of\nvirtue, we are always inclined to think her handsomest when she\ncondescends to smile upon ourselves.\n\nIt would be trite to observe the easy gradation from esteem to love: in\nthe bosom of Harley there scarce needed a transition; for there were\ncertain seasons when his ideas were flushed to a degree much above their\ncommon complexion.  In times not credulous of inspiration, we should\naccount for this from some natural cause; but we do not mean to account\nfor it at all; it were sufficient to describe its effects; but they were\nsometimes so ludicrous, as might derogate from the dignity of the\nsensations which produced them to describe.  They were treated indeed as\nsuch by most of Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sober friends, who often laughed very heartily\nat the awkward blunders of the real Harley, when the different faculties,\nwhich should have prevented them, were entirely occupied by the ideal.\nIn some of these paroxysms of fancy, Miss Walton did not fail to be\nintroduced; and the picture which had been drawn amidst the surrounding\nobjects of unnoticed levity was now singled out to be viewed through the\nmedium of romantic imagination: it was improved of course, and esteem was\na word inexpressive of the feelings which it excited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\nHE SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE BEGGAR AND HIS DOG.\n\n\nHE had taken leave of his aunt on the eve of his intended departure; but\nthe good lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affection for her nephew interrupted her sleep, and early\nas it was next morning when Harley came downstairs to set out, he found\nher in the parlour with a tear on her cheek, and her caudle-cup in her\nhand.  She knew enough of physic to prescribe against going abroad of a\nmorning with an empty stomach.  She gave her blessing with the draught;\nher instructions she had delivered the night before.  They consisted\nmostly of negatives, for London, in her idea, was so replete with\ntemptations that it needed the whole armour of her friendly cautions to\nrepel their attacks.\n\nPeter stood at the door.  We have mentioned this faithful fellow\nformerly: Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father had taken him up an orphan, and saved him from\nbeing cast on the parish; and he had ever since remained in the service\nof him and of his son.  Harley shook him by the hand as he passed,\nsmiling, as if he had said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not weep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He sprung hastily into\nthe chaise that waited for him; Peter folded up the step.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear\nmaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, shaking the solitary lock that hung on either side of\nhis head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been told as how London is a sad place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He was choked\nwith the thought, and his benediction could not be heard:\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it shall be\nheard, honest Peter! where these tears will add to its energy.\n\nIn a few hours Harley reached the inn where he proposed breakfasting, but\nthe fulness of his heart would not suffer him to eat a morsel.  He walked\nout on the road, and gaining a little height, stood gazing on that\nquarter he had left.  He looked for his wonted prospect, his fields, his\nwoods, and his hills: they were lost in the distant clouds!  He pencilled\nthem on the clouds, and bade them farewell with a sigh!\n\nHe sat down on a large stone to take out a little pebble from his shoe,\nwhen he saw, at some distance, a beggar approaching him.  He had on a\nloose sort of coat, mended with different-coloured rags, amongst which\nthe blue and the russet were the predominant.  He had a short knotty\nstick in his hand, and on the top of it was stuck a ram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horn; his knees\n(though he was no pilgrim) had worn the stuff of his breeches; he wore no\nshoes, and his stockings had entirely lost that part of them which should\nhave covered his feet and ankles; in his face, however, was the plump\nappearance of good humour; he walked a good round pace, and a\ncrook-legged dog trotted at his heels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur delicacies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009care fantastic; they are not in\nnature! that beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones barefooted,\nwhilst I have lost the most delightful dream in the world, from the\nsmallest of them happening to get into my shoe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The beggar had by this\ntime come up, and, pulling off a piece of hat, asked charity of Harley;\nthe dog began to beg too:\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was impossible to resist both; and, in\ntruth, the want of shoes and stockings had made both unnecessary, for\nHarley had destined sixpence for him before.  The beggar, on receiving\nit, poured forth blessings without number; and, with a sort of smile on\nhis countenance, said to Harley \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if he wanted to have his fortune\ntold\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harley turned his eye briskly on the beggar: it was an unpromising\nlook for the subject of a prediction, and silenced the prophet\nimmediately.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would much rather learn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat it is in\nyour power to tell me: your trade must be an entertaining one; sit down\non this stone, and let me know something of your profession; I have often\nthought of turning fortune-teller for a week or two myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the beggar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like your frankness much; God knows I\nhad the humour of plain-dealing in me from a child, but there is no doing\nwith it in this world; we must live as we can, and lying is, as you call\nit, my profession, but I was in some sort forced to the trade, for I\ndealt once in telling truth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was a labourer, sir, and gained as much as to make me live: I never\nlaid by indeed: for I was reckoned a piece of a wag, and your wags, I\ntake it, are seldom rich, Mr. Harley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou seem to know me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, there are few folks in the country that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know something of:\nhow should I tell fortunes else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrue; but to go on with your story: you were a labourer, you say, and a\nwag; your industry, I suppose, you left with your old trade, but your\nhumour you preserve to be of use to you in your new.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat signifies sadness, sir? a man grows lean on\u00e2\u0080\u0099t: but I was brought to\nmy idleness by degrees; first I could not work, and it went against my\nstomach to work ever after.  I was seized with a jail fever at the time\nof the assizes being in the county where I lived; for I was always\ncurious to get acquainted with the felons, because they are commonly\nfellows of much mirth and little thought, qualities I had ever an esteem\nfor.  In the height of this fever, Mr. Harley, the house where I lay took\nfire, and burnt to the ground; I was carried out in that condition, and\nlay all the rest of my illness in a barn.  I got the better of my\ndisease, however, but I was so weak that I spit blood whenever I\nattempted to work.  I had no relation living that I knew of, and I never\nkept a friend above a week, when I was able to joke; I seldom remained\nabove six months in a parish, so that I might have died before I had\nfound a settlement in any: thus I was forced to beg my bread, and a sorry\ntrade I found it, Mr. Harley.  I told all my misfortunes truly, but they\nwere seldom believed; and the few who gave me a halfpenny as they passed\ndid it with a shake of the head, and an injunction not to trouble them\nwith a long story.  In short, I found that people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to give alms\nwithout some security for their money; a wooden leg or a withered arm is\na sort of draught upon heaven for those who choose to have their money\nplaced to account there; so I changed my plan, and, instead of telling my\nown misfortunes, began to prophesy happiness to others.  This I found by\nmuch the better way: folks will always listen when the tale is their own,\nand of many who say they do not believe in fortune-telling, I have known\nfew on whom it had not a very sensible effect.  I pick up the names of\ntheir acquaintance; amours and little squabbles are easily gleaned among\nservants and neighbours; and indeed people themselves are the best\nintelligencers in the world for our purpose: they dare not puzzle us for\ntheir own sakes, for every one is anxious to hear what they wish to\nbelieve, and they who repeat it, to laugh at it when they have done, are\ngenerally more serious than their hearers are apt to imagine.  With a\ntolerable good memory, and some share of cunning, with the help of\nwalking a-nights over heaths and church-yards, with this, and showing the\ntricks of that there dog, whom I stole from the serjeant of a marching\nregiment (and by the way, he can steal too upon occasion), I make shift\nto pick up a livelihood.  My trade, indeed, is none of the honestest; yet\npeople are not much cheated neither who give a few half-pence for a\nprospect of happiness, which I have heard some persons say is all a man\ncan arrive at in this world.  But I must bid you good day, sir, for I\nhave three miles to walk before noon, to inform some boarding-school\nyoung ladies whether their husbands are to be peers of the realm or\ncaptains in the army: a question which I promised to answer them by that\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley had drawn a shilling from his pocket; but Virtue bade him consider\non whom he was going to bestow it.  Virtue held back his arm; but a\nmilder form, a younger sister of Virtue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, not so severe as Virtue, nor\nso serious as Pity, smiled upon him; his fingers lost their compression,\nnor did Virtue offer to catch the money as it fell.  It had no sooner\nreached the ground than the watchful cur (a trick he had been taught)\nsnapped it up, and, contrary to the most approved method of stewardship,\ndelivered it immediately into the hands of his master.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\nHE MAKES A SECOND EXPEDITION TO THE BARONET\u00e2\u0080\u0099S.  THE LAUDABLE AMBITION OF\nA YOUNG MAN TO BE THOUGHT SOMETHING BY THE WORLD.\n\n\nWE have related, in a former chapter, the little success of his first\nvisit to the great man, for whom he had the introductory letter from Mr.\nWalton.  To people of equal sensibility, the influence of those trifles\nwe mentioned on his deportment will not appear surprising, but to his\nfriends in the country they could not be stated, nor would they have\nallowed them any place in the account.  In some of their letters,\ntherefore, which he received soon after, they expressed their surprise at\nhis not having been more urgent in his application, and again recommended\nthe blushless assiduity of successful merit.\n\nHe resolved to make another attempt at the baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; fortified with\nhigher notions of his own dignity, and with less apprehension of repulse.\nIn his way to Grosvenor Square he began to ruminate on the folly of\nmankind, who affixed those ideas of superiority to riches, which reduced\nthe minds of men, by nature equal with the more fortunate, to that sort\nof servility which he felt in his own.  By the time he had reached the\nSquare, and was walking along the pavement which led to the baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, he\nhad brought his reasoning on the subject to such a point, that the\nconclusion, by every rule of logic, should have led him to a thorough\nindifference in his approaches to a fellow-mortal, whether that\nfellow-mortal was possessed of six or six thousand pounds a year.  It is\nprobable, however, that the premises had been improperly formed: for it\nis certain, that when he approached the great man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door he felt his\nheart agitated by an unusual pulsation.\n\nHe had almost reached it, when he observed among gentleman coming out,\ndressed in a white frock and a red laced waistcoat, with a small switch\nin his hand, which he seemed to manage with a particular good grace.  As\nhe passed him on the steps, the stranger very politely made him a bow,\nwhich Harley returned, though he could not remember ever having seen him\nbefore.  He asked Harley, in the same civil manner, if he was going to\nwait on his friend the baronet.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor I was just calling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nam sorry to find that he is gone for some days into the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley thanked him for his information, and was turning from the door,\nwhen the other observed that it would be proper to leave his name, and\nvery obligingly knocked for that purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a gentleman, Tom, who meant to have waited on your master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour name, if you please, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHarley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember, Tom, Harley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door was shut.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince we are here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall not lose our\nwalk if we add a little to it by a turn or two in Hyde Park.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe accompanied this proposal with a second bow, and Harley accepted of it\nby another in return.\n\nThe conversation, as they walked, was brilliant on the side of his\ncompanion.  The playhouse, the opera, with every occurrence in high life,\nhe seemed perfectly master of; and talked of some reigning beauties of\nquality in a manner the most feeling in the world.  Harley admired the\nhappiness of his vivacity, and, opposite as it was to the reserve of his\nown nature, began to be much pleased with its effects.\n\nThough I am not of opinion with some wise men, that the existence of\nobjects depends on idea, yet I am convinced that their appearance is not\na little influenced by it.  The optics of some minds are in so unlucky a\nperspective as to throw a certain shade on every picture that is\npresented to them, while those of others (of which number was Harley),\nlike the mirrors of the ladies, have a wonderful effect in bettering\ntheir complexions.  Through such a medium perhaps he was looking on his\npresent companion.\n\nWhen they had finished their walk, and were returning by the corner of\nthe Park, they observed a board hung out of a window signifying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn\nexcellent ORDINARY on Saturdays and Sundays.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It happened to be\nSaturday, and the table was covered for the purpose.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if we should go in and dine here, if you happen not to be engaged,\nsir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young gentleman.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not impossible but we shall meet\nwith some original or other; it is a sort of humour I like hugely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley made no objection, and the stranger showed him the way into the\nparlour.\n\nHe was placed, by the courtesy of his introductor, in an arm-chair that\nstood at one side of the fire.  Over against him was seated a man of a\ngrave considering aspect, with that look of sober prudence which\nindicates what is commonly called a warm man.  He wore a pretty large\nwig, which had once been white, but was now of a brownish yellow; his\ncoat was one of those modest-coloured drabs which mock the injuries of\ndust and dirt; two jack-boots concealed, in part, the well-mended knees\nof an old pair of buckskin breeches; while the spotted handkerchief round\nhis neck preserved at once its owner from catching cold and his\nneck-cloth from being dirtied.  Next him sat another man, with a tankard\nin his hand and a quid of tobacco in his cheek, whose eye was rather more\nvivacious, and whose dress was something smarter.\n\nThe first-mentioned gentleman took notice that the room had been so\nlately washed, as not to have had time to dry, and remarked that wet\nlodging was unwholesome for man or beast.  He looked round at the same\ntime for a poker to stir the fire with, which, he at last observed to the\ncompany, the people of the house had removed in order to save their\ncoals.  This difficulty, however, he overcame by the help of Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstick, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat as they should, no doubt, pay for their fire in some\nshape or other, he saw no reason why they should not have the use of it\nwhile they sat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe door was now opened for the admission of dinner.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how\nit is with you, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new acquaintance, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I am\nafraid I shall not be able to get down a morsel at this horrid mechanical\nhour of dining.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He sat down, however, and did not show any want of\nappetite by his eating.  He took upon him the carving of the meat, and\ncriticised on the goodness of the pudding.\n\nWhen the table-cloth was removed, he proposed calling for some punch,\nwhich was readily agreed to; he seemed at first inclined to make it\nhimself, but afterwards changed his mind, and left that province to the\nwaiter, telling him to have it pure West Indian, or he could not taste a\ndrop of it.\n\nWhen the punch was brought he undertook to fill the glasses and call the\ntoasts.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe King.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094The toast naturally produced politics.  It is the\nprivilege of Englishmen to drink the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, and to talk of his\nconduct.  The man who sat opposite to Harley (and who by this time,\npartly from himself, and partly from his acquaintance on his left hand,\nwas discovered to be a grazier) observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat it was a shame for so\nmany pensioners to be allowed to take the bread out of the mouth of the\npoor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, and provisions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere never so dear in the memory\nof man; I wish the king and his counsellors would look to that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for the matter of provisions, neighbour Wrightson,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nsure the prices of cattle\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA dispute would have probably ensued, but it was prevented by the spruce\ntoastmaster, who gave a sentiment, and turning to the two politicians,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us have done with these musty politics:\nI would always leave them to the beer-suckers in Butcher Row.  Come, let\nus have something of the fine arts.  That was a damn\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hard match between\nJoe the Nailor and Tim Bucket.  The knowing ones were cursedly taken in\nthere!  I lost a cool hundred myself, faith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt mention of the cool hundred, the grazier threw his eyes aslant, with a\nmingled look of doubt and surprise; while the man at his elbow looked\narch, and gave a short emphatical sort of cough.\n\nBoth seemed to be silenced, however, by this intelligence; and while the\nremainder of the punch lasted the conversation was wholly engrossed by\nthe gentleman with the fine waistcoat, who told a great many \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmense\ncomical stories\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfounded smart things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he termed them, acted\nand spoken by lords, ladies, and young bucks of quality, of his\nacquaintance.  At last, the grazier, pulling out a watch, of a very\nunusual size, and telling the hour, said that he had an appointment.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs\nit so late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young gentleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen I am afraid I have missed an\nappointment already; but the truth is, I am cursedly given to missing of\nappointments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the grazier and he were gone, Harley turned to the remaining\npersonage, and asked him if he knew that young gentleman.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cA gentleman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cay, he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit.  I\nknew him, some years ago, in the quality of a footman; and I believe he\nhad some times the honour to be a pimp.  At last, some of the great\nfolks, to whom he had been serviceable in both capacities, had him made a\ngauger; in which station he remains, and has the assurance to pretend an\nacquaintance with men of quality.  The impudent dog! with a few shillings\nin his pocket, he will talk you three times as much as my friend Mundy\nthere, who is worth nine thousand if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth a farthing.  But I know\nthe rascal, and despise him, as he deserves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley began to despise him too, and to conceive some indignation at\nhaving sat with patience to hear such a fellow speak nonsense.  But he\ncorrected himself by reflecting that he was perhaps as well entertained,\nand instructed too, by this same modest gauger, as he should have been by\nsuch a man as he had thought proper to personate.  And surely the fault\nmay more properly be imputed to that rank where the futility is real than\nwhere it is feigned: to that rank whose opportunities for nobler\naccomplishments have only served to rear a fabric of folly which the\nuntutored hand of affectation, even among the meanest of mankind, can\nimitate with success.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\nHE VISITS BEDLAM.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE DISTRESSES OF A DAUGHTER.\n\n\nOf those things called Sights in London, which every stranger is supposed\ndesirous to see, Bedlam is one.  To that place, therefore, an\nacquaintance of Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, after having accompanied him to several other\nshows, proposed a visit.  Harley objected to it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nthink it an inhuman practice to expose the greatest misery with which our\nnature is afflicted to every idle visitant who can afford a trifling\nperquisite to the keeper; especially as it is a distress which the humane\nmust see, with the painful reflection, that it is not in their power to\nalleviate it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He was overpowered, however, by the solicitations of his\nfriend and the other persons of the party (amongst whom were several\nladies); and they went in a body to Moorfields.\n\nTheir conductor led them first to the dismal mansions of those who are in\nthe most horrid state of incurable madness.  The clanking of chains, the\nwildness of their cries, and the imprecations which some of them uttered,\nformed a scene inexpressibly shocking.  Harley and his companions,\nespecially the female part of them, begged their guide to return; he\nseemed surprised at their uneasiness, and was with difficulty prevailed\non to leave that part of the house without showing them some others: who,\nas he expressed it in the phrase of those that keep wild beasts for show,\nwere much better worth seeing than any they had passed, being ten times\nmore fierce and unmanageable.\n\nHe led them next to that quarter where those reside who, as they are not\ndangerous to themselves or others, enjoy a certain degree of freedom,\naccording to the state of their distemper.\n\nHarley had fallen behind his companions, looking at a man who was making\npendulums with bits of thread and little balls of clay.  He had\ndelineated a segment of a circle on the wall with chalk, and marked their\ndifferent vibrations by intersecting it with cross lines.  A\ndecent-looking man came up, and smiling at the maniac, turned to Harley,\nand told him that gentleman had once been a very celebrated\nmathematician.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe fell a sacrifice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the theory of comets;\nfor having, with infinite labour, formed a table on the conjectures of\nSir Isaac Newton, he was disappointed in the return of one of those\nluminaries, and was very soon after obliged to be placed here by his\nfriends.  If you please to follow me, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nbelieve I shall be able to give you a more satisfactory account of the\nunfortunate people you see here than the man who attends your\ncompanions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley bowed, and accepted his offer.\n\nThe next person they came up to had scrawled a variety of figures on a\npiece of slate.  Harley had the curiosity to take a nearer view of them.\nThey consisted of different columns, on the top of which were marked\nSouth-sea annuities, India-stock, and Three per cent. annuities consol.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instructor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a gentleman well known in Change\nAlley.  He was once worth fifty thousand pounds, and had actually agreed\nfor the purchase of an estate in the West, in order to realise his money;\nbut he quarrelled with the proprietor about the repairs of the garden\nwall, and so returned to town, to follow his old trade of stock-jobbing a\nlittle longer; when an unlucky fluctuation of stock, in which he was\nengaged to an immense extent, reduced him at once to poverty and to\nmadness.  Poor wretch! he told me t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other day that against the next\npayment of differences he should be some hundreds above a plum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a spondee, and I will maintain it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted a voice on his\nleft hand.  This assertion was followed by a very rapid recital of some\nverses from Homer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat figure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhose clothes are\nso bedaubed with snuff, was a schoolmaster of some reputation: he came\nhither to be resolved of some doubts he entertained concerning the\ngenuine pronunciation of the Greek vowels.  In his highest fits, he makes\nfrequent mention of one Mr. Bentley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut delusive ideas, sir, are the motives of the greatest part of\nmankind, and a heated imagination the power by which their actions are\nincited: the world, in the eye of a philosopher, may be said to be a\nlarge madhouse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe passions of men are\ntemporary madnesses; and sometimes very fatal in their effects.\n\n    From Macedonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s madman to the Swede.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca very mad thing in Charles to\nthink of adding so vast a country as Russia to his dominions: that would\nhave been fatal indeed; the balance of the North would then have been\nlost; but the Sultan and I would never have allowed it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nHarley, with no small surprise on his countenance.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Sultan and I; do you know me?  I am the Chan of Tartary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley was a good deal struck by this discovery; he had prudence enough,\nhowever, to conceal his amazement, and bowing as low to the monarch as\nhis dignity required, left him immediately, and joined his companions.\n\nHe found them in a quarter of the house set apart for the insane of the\nother sex, several of whom had gathered about the female visitors, and\nwere examining, with rather more accuracy than might have been expected,\nthe particulars of their dress.\n\nSeparate from the rest stood one whose appearance had something of\nsuperior dignity.  Her face, though pale and wasted, was less squalid\nthan those of the others, and showed a dejection of that decent kind,\nwhich moves our pity unmixed with horror: upon her, therefore, the eyes\nof all were immediately turned.  The keeper who accompanied them observed\nit: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis a young lady who was born to ride in her coach\nand six.  She was beloved, if the story I have heard is true, by a young\ngentleman, her equal in birth, though by no means her match in fortune:\nbut love, they say, is blind, and so she fancied him as much as he did\nher.  Her father, it seems, would not hear of their marriage, and\nthreatened to turn her out of doors if ever she saw him again.  Upon this\nthe young gentleman took a voyage to the West Indies, in hopes of\nbettering his fortune, and obtaining his mistress; but he was scarce\nlanded, when he was seized with one of the fevers which are common in\nthose islands, and died in a few days, lamented by every one that knew\nhim.  This news soon reached his mistress, who was at the same time\npressed by her father to marry a rich miserly fellow, who was old enough\nto be her grandfather.  The death of her lover had no effect on her\ninhuman parent: he was only the more earnest for her marriage with the\nman he had provided for her; and what between her despair at the death of\nthe one, and her aversion to the other, the poor young lady was reduced\nto the condition you see her in.  But God would not prosper such cruelty;\nher father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affairs soon after went to wreck, and he died almost a\nbeggar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThough this story was told in very plain language, it had particularly\nattracted Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice; he had given it the tribute of some tears.\nThe unfortunate young lady had till now seemed entranced in thought, with\nher eyes fixed on a little garnet ring she wore on her finger; she turned\nthem now upon Harley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Billy is no more!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you weep for\nmy Billy?  Blessings on your tears!  I would weep too, but my brain is\ndry; and it burns, it burns, it burns!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She drew nearer to Harley.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe\ncomforted, young lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour Billy is in heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he,\nindeed? and shall we meet again? and shall that frightful man (pointing\nto the keeper) not be there!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Alas!  I am grown naughty of late; I have\nalmost forgotten to think of heaven: yet I pray sometimes; when I can, I\npray; and sometimes I sing; when I am saddest, I sing:\u00e2\u0080\u0094You shall hear\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094hush!\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight be the earth on Billy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast,\n    And green the sod that wraps his grave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a plaintive wildness in the air not to be withstood; and,\nexcept the keeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, there was not an unmoistened eye around her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you weep again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would not have you weep: you are like\nmy Billy; you are, believe me; just so he looked when he gave me this\nring; poor Billy! \u00e2\u0080\u0099twas the last time ever we met!\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas when the seas were roaring\u00e2\u0080\u0094I love you for resembling my Billy; but\nI shall never love any man like him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She stretched out her hand to\nHarley; he pressed it between both of his, and bathed it with his\ntears.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, that is Billy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou cannot have it,\nindeed; but here is another, look here, which I plated to-day of some\ngold-thread from this bit of stuff; will you keep it for my sake?  I am a\nstrange girl; but my heart is harmless: my poor heart; it will burst some\nday; feel how it beats!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She pressed his hand to her bosom, then holding\nher head in the attitude of listening\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark! one, two, three! be quiet,\nthou little trembler; my Billy is cold!\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I had forgotten the\nring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She put it on his finger.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFarewell!  I must leave you now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She\nwould have withdrawn her hand; Harley held it to his lips.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare not\nstay longer; my head throbs sadly: farewell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She walked with a hurried\nstep to a little apartment at some distance.  Harley stood fixed in\nastonishment and pity; his friend gave money to the keeper.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harley looked\non his ring.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He put a couple of guineas into the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe kind to\nthat unfortunate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He burst into tears, and left them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\nTHE MISANTHROPE.\n\n\nTHE friend who had conducted him to Moorfields called upon him again the\nnext evening.  After some talk on the adventures of the preceding day: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncarried you yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto visit the mad; let me\nintroduce you to-night, at supper, to one of the wise: but you must not\nlook for anything of the Socratic pleasantry about him; on the contrary,\nI warn you to expect the spirit of a Diogenes.  That you may be a little\nprepared for his extraordinary manner, I will let you into some\nparticulars of his history.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is the elder of the two sons of a gentleman of considerable estate in\nthe country.  Their father died when they were young: both were\nremarkable at school for quickness of parts and extent of genius; this\nhad been bred to no profession, because his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune, which\ndescended to him, was thought sufficient to set him above it; the other\nwas put apprentice to an eminent attorney.  In this the expectations of\nhis friends were more consulted than his own inclination; for both his\nbrother and he had feelings of that warm kind that could ill brook a\nstudy so dry as the law, especially in that department of it which was\nallotted to him.  But the difference of their tempers made the\ncharacteristical distinction between them.  The younger, from the\ngentleness of his nature, bore with patience a situation entirely\ndiscordant to his genius and disposition.  At times, indeed, his pride\nwould suggest of how little importance those talents were which the\npartiality of his friends had often extolled: they were now incumbrances\nin a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant passed him at every\nturn; his fancy and his feeling were invincible obstacles to eminence in\na situation where his fancy had no room for exertion, and his feeling\nexperienced perpetual disgust.  But these murmurings he never suffered to\nbe heard; and that he might not offend the prudence of those who had been\nconcerned in the choice of his profession, he continued to labour in it\nseveral years, till, by the death of a relation, he succeeded to an\nestate of a little better than \u00c2\u00a3100 a year, with which, and the small\npatrimony left him, he retired into the country, and made a love-match\nwith a young lady of a similar temper to his own, with whom the sagacious\nworld pitied him for finding happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut his elder brother, whom you are to see at supper, if you will do us\nthe favour of your company, was naturally impetuous, decisive, and\noverbearing.  He entered into life with those ardent expectations by\nwhich young men are commonly deluded: in his friendships, warm to excess;\nand equally violent in his dislikes.  He was on the brink of marriage\nwith a young lady, when one of those friends, for whose honour he would\nhave pawned his life, made an elopement with that very goddess, and left\nhim besides deeply engaged for sums which that good friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s extravagance\nhad squandered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for ideas of a very\ndifferent nature.  He abjured all confidence in anything of human form;\nsold his lands, which still produced him a very large reversion, came to\ntown, and immured himself, with a woman who had been his nurse, in little\nbetter than a garret; and has ever since applied his talents to the\nvilifying of his species.  In one thing I must take the liberty to\ninstruct you; however different your sentiments may be (and different\nthey must be), you will suffer him to go on without contradiction;\notherwise, he will be silent immediately, and we shall not get a word\nfrom him all the night after.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley promised to remember this\ninjunction, and accepted the invitation of his friend.\n\nWhen they arrived at the house, they were informed that the gentleman was\ncome, and had been shown into the parlour.  They found him sitting with a\ndaughter of his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, about three years old, on his knee, whom he was\nteaching the alphabet from a horn book: at a little distance stood a\nsister of hers, some years older.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet you away, miss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to this\nlast; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are a pert gossip, and I will have nothing to do with\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNancy is your favourite; you are quite in\nlove with Nancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake away that girl,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to her father, whom he\nnow observed to have entered the room; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has woman about her already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe children were accordingly dismissed.\n\nBetwixt that and supper-time he did not utter a syllable.  When supper\ncame, he quarrelled with every dish at table, but eat of them all; only\nexempting from his censures a salad, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich you have not spoiled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause you have not attempted to cook it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the wine was set upon the table, he took from his pocket a\nparticular smoking apparatus, and filled his pipe, without taking any\nmore notice of Harley, or his friend, than if no such persons had been in\nthe room.\n\nHarley could not help stealing a look of surprise at him; but his friend,\nwho knew his humour, returned it by annihilating his presence in the like\nmanner, and, leaving him to his own meditations, addressed himself\nentirely to Harley.\n\nIn their discourse some mention happened to be made of an amiable\ncharacter, and the words _honour_ and _politeness_ were applied to it.\nUpon this, the gentleman, laying down his pipe, and changing the tone of\nhis countenance, from an ironical grin to something more intently\ncontemptuous: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonour and Politeness! this is the coin\nof the world, and passes current with the fools of it.  You have\nsubstituted the shadow Honour, instead of the substance Virtue; and have\nbanished the reality of friendship for the fictitious semblance which you\nhave termed Politeness: politeness, which consists in a certain\nceremonious jargon, more ridiculous to the ear of reason than the voice\nof a puppet.  You have invented sounds, which you worship, though they\ntyrannize over your peace; and are surrounded with empty forms, which\ntake from the honest emotions of joy, and add to the poignancy of\nmisfortune.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0094his friend winked to him, to remind him\nof the caution he had received.  He was silenced by the thought.  The\nphilosopher turned his eye upon him: he examined him from top to toe,\nwith a sort of triumphant contempt; Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat happened to be a new\none; the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was as shabby as could possibly be supposed to be on the\nback of a gentleman: there was much significance in his look with regard\nto this coat; it spoke of the sleekness of folly and the threadbareness\nof wisdom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTruth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most amiable, as well as the most natural of\nvirtues, you are at pains to eradicate.  Your very nurseries are\nseminaries of falsehood; and what is called Fashion in manhood completes\nthe system of avowed insincerity.  Mankind, in the gross, is a gaping\nmonster, that loves to be deceived, and has seldom been disappointed: nor\nis their vanity less fallacious to your philosophers, who adopt modes of\ntruth to follow them through the paths of error, and defend paradoxes\nmerely to be singular in defending them.  These are they whom ye term\nIngenious; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a phrase of commendation I detest: it implies an attempt\nto impose on my judgment, by flattering my imagination; yet these are\nthey whose works are read by the old with delight, which the young are\ntaught to look upon as the codes of knowledge and philosophy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, the education of your youth is every way preposterous; you waste\nat school years in improving talents, without having ever spent an hour\nin discovering them; one promiscuous line of instruction is followed,\nwithout regard to genius, capacity, or probable situation in the\ncommonwealth.  From this bear-garden of the pedagogue, a raw,\nunprincipled boy is turned loose upon the world to travel; without any\nideas but those of improving his dress at Paris, or starting into taste\nby gazing on some paintings at Rome.  Ask him of the manners of the\npeople, and he will tell you that the skirt is worn much shorter in\nFrance, and that everybody eats macaroni in Italy.  When he returns home,\nhe buys a seat in parliament, and studies the constitution at Arthur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor are your females trained to any more useful purpose: they are\ntaught, by the very rewards which their nurses propose for good\nbehaviour, by the first thing like a jest which they hear from every male\nvisitor of the family, that a young woman is a creature to be married;\nand when they are grown somewhat older, are instructed that it is the\npurpose of marriage to have the enjoyment of pin-money, and the\nexpectation of a jointure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese, {61} indeed, are the effects of luxury, which is, perhaps,\ninseparable from a certain degree of power and grandeur in a nation.  But\nit is not simply of the progress of luxury that we have to complain: did\nits votaries keep in their own sphere of thoughtless dissipation, we\nmight despise them without emotion; but the frivolous pursuits of\npleasure are mingled with the most important concerns of the state; and\npublic enterprise shall sleep till he who should guide its operation has\ndecided his bets at Newmarket, or fulfilled his engagement with a\nfavourite mistress in the country.  We want some man of acknowledged\neminence to point our counsels with that firmness which the counsels of a\ngreat people require.  We have hundreds of ministers, who press forward\ninto office without having ever learned that art which is necessary for\nevery business: the art of thinking; and mistake the petulance, which\ncould give inspiration to smart sarcasms on an obnoxious measure in a\npopular assembly, for the ability which is to balance the interest of\nkingdoms, and investigate the latent sources of national superiority.\nWith the administration of such men the people can never be satisfied;\nfor besides that their confidence is gained only by the view of superior\ntalents, there needs that depth of knowledge, which is not only\nacquainted with the just extent of power, but can also trace its\nconnection with the expedient, to preserve its possessors from the\ncontempt which attends irresolution, or the resentment which follows\ntemerity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n[Here a considerable part is wanting.]\n\n* * \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short, man is an animal equally selfish and vain.  Vanity,\nindeed, is but a modification of selfishness.  From the latter, there are\nsome who pretend to be free: they are generally such as declaim against\nthe lust of wealth and power, because they have never been able to attain\nany high degree in either: they boast of generosity and feeling.  They\ntell us (perhaps they tell us in rhyme) that the sensations of an honest\nheart, of a mind universally benevolent, make up the quiet bliss which\nthey enjoy; but they will not, by this, be exempted from the charge of\nselfishness.  Whence the luxurious happiness they describe in their\nlittle family-circles?  Whence the pleasure which they feel, when they\ntrim their evening fires, and listen to the howl of winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wind?\nWhence, but from the secret reflection of what houseless wretches feel\nfrom it?  Or do you administer comfort in affliction\u00e2\u0080\u0094the motive is at\nhand; I have had it preached to me in nineteen out of twenty of your\nconsolatory discourses\u00e2\u0080\u0094the comparative littleness of our own misfortunes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith vanity your best virtues are grossly tainted: your benevolence,\nwhich ye deduce immediately from the natural impulse of the heart,\nsquints to it for its reward.  There are some, indeed, who tell us of the\nsatisfaction which flows from a secret consciousness of good actions:\nthis secret satisfaction is truly excellent\u00e2\u0080\u0094when we have some friend to\nwhom we may discover its excellence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe now paused a moment to re-light his pipe, when a clock, that stood at\nhis back, struck eleven; he started up at the sound, took his hat and his\ncane, and nodding good night with his head, walked out of the room.  The\ngentleman of the house called a servant to bring the stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surtout.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat sort of a night is it, fellow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt rains, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nthe servant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith an easterly wind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cEasterly for ever!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He made no\nother reply; but shrugging up his shoulders till they almost touched his\nears, wrapped himself tight in his great coat, and disappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a strange creature,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend to Harley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat his remarks are of the pleasant kind: it is curious to\nobserve how the nature of truth may be changed by the garb it wears;\nsoftened to the admonition of friendship, or soured into the severity of\nreproof: yet this severity may be useful to some tempers; it somewhat\nresembles a file: disagreeable in its operation, but hard metals may be\nthe brighter for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\nHIS SKILL IN PHYSIOGNOMY.\n\n\nTHE company at the baronet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s removed to the playhouse accordingly, and\nHarley took his usual route into the Park.  He observed, as he entered, a\nfresh-looking elderly gentleman in conversation with a beggar, who,\nleaning on his crutch, was recounting the hardships he had undergone, and\nexplaining the wretchedness of his present condition.  This was a very\ninteresting dialogue to Harley; he was rude enough, therefore, to slacken\nhis pace as he approached, and at last to make a full stop at the\ngentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, who was just then expressing his compassion for the\nbeggar, and regretting that he had not a farthing of change about him.\nAt saying this, he looked piteously on the fellow: there was something in\nhis physiognomy which caught Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice: indeed, physiognomy was one\nof Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foibles, for which he had been often rebuked by his aunt in\nthe country, who used to tell him that when he was come to her years and\nexperience he would know that all\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not gold that glitters: and it must\nbe owned that his aunt was a very sensible, harsh-looking maiden lady of\nthreescore and upwards.  But he was too apt to forget this caution and\nnow, it seems, it had not occurred to him.  Stepping up, therefore, to\nthe gentleman, who was lamenting the want of silver, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour intentions,\nsir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009care so good, that I cannot help lending you my assistance\nto carry them into execution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gave the beggar a shilling.  The other\nreturned a suitable compliment, and extolled the benevolence of Harley.\nThey kept walking together, and benevolence grew the topic of discourse.\n\nThe stranger was fluent on the subject.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no use of money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cequal to that of beneficence.  With the profuse, it is lost; and\neven with those who lay it out according to the prudence of the world,\nthe objects acquired by it pall on the sense, and have scarce become our\nown till they lose their value with the power of pleasing; but here the\nenjoyment grows on reflection, and our money is most truly ours when it\nceases being in our possession.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet I agree in some measure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith those who think\nthat charity to our common beggars is often misplaced; there are objects\nless obtrusive whose title is a better one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot easily distinguish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand even of the\nworthless, are there not many whose imprudence, or whose vice, may have\nbeen one dreadful consequence of misfortune?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley looked again in his face, and blessed himself for his skill in\nphysiognomy.\n\nBy this time they had reached the end of the walk, the old gentleman\nleaning on the rails to take breath, and in the meantime they were joined\nby a younger man, whose figure was much above the appearance of his\ndress, which was poor and shabby.  Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former companion addressed\nhim as an acquaintance, and they turned on the walk together.\n\nThe elder of the strangers complained of the closeness of the evening,\nand asked the other if he would go with him into a house hard by, and\ntake one draught of excellent cyder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man who keeps this house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he to Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas once a servant of mine.  I could not think of\nturning loose upon the world a faithful old fellow, for no other reason\nbut that his age had incapacitated him; so I gave him an annuity of ten\npounds, with the help of which he has set up this little place here, and\nhis daughter goes and sells milk in the city, while her father manages\nhis tap-room, as he calls it, at home.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well ask a gentleman of\nyour appearance to accompany me to so paltry a place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nHarley, interrupting him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would much rather enter it than the most\ncelebrated tavern in town.  To give to the necessitous may sometimes be a\nweakness in the man; to encourage industry is a duty in the citizen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThey entered the house accordingly.\n\nOn a table at the corner of the room lay a pack of cards, loosely thrown\ntogether.  The old gentleman reproved the man of the house for\nencouraging so idle an amusement.  Harley attempted to defend him from\nthe necessity of accommodating himself to the humour of his guests, and\ntaking up the cards, began to shuffle them backwards and forwards in his\nhand.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think cards so unpardonable an amusement as some\ndo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand now and then, about this time of the\nevening, when my eyes begin to fail me for my book, I divert myself with\na game at piquet, without finding my morals a bit relaxed by it.  Do you\nplay piquet, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d (to Harley.)  Harley answered in the affirmative; upon\nwhich the other proposed playing a pool at a shilling the game, doubling\nthe stakes; adding, that he never played higher with anybody.\n\nHarley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good nature could not refuse the benevolent old man; and the\nyounger stranger, though he at first pleaded prior engagements, yet being\nearnestly solicited by his friend, at last yielded to solicitation.\n\nWhen they began to play, the old gentleman, somewhat to the surprise of\nHarley, produced ten shillings to serve for markers of his score.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nhad no change for the beggar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley to himself; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I can easily\naccount for it; it is curious to observe the affection that inanimate\nthings will create in us by a long acquaintance.  If I may judge from my\nown feelings, the old man would not part with one of these counters for\nten times its intrinsic value; it even got the better of his benevolence!\nI, myself, have a pair of old brass sleeve buttons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Here he was\ninterrupted by being told that the old gentleman had beat the younger,\nand that it was his turn to take up the conqueror.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour game has been\nshort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI re-piqued him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old man, with joy\nsparkling in his countenance.  Harley wished to be re-piqued too, but he\nwas disappointed; for he had the same good fortune against his opponent.\nIndeed, never did fortune, mutable as she is, delight in mutability so\nmuch as at that moment.  The victory was so quick, and so constantly\nalternate, that the stake, in a short time, amounted to no less a sum\nthan \u00c2\u00a312, Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proportion of which was within half-a-guinea of the\nmoney he had in his pocket.  He had before proposed a division, but the\nold gentleman opposed it with such a pleasant warmth in his manner, that\nit was always over-ruled.  Now, however, he told them that he had an\nappointment with some gentlemen, and it was within a few minutes of his\nhour.  The young stranger had gained one game, and was engaged in the\nsecond with the other; they agreed, therefore, that the stake should be\ndivided, if the old gentleman won that: which was more than probable, as\nhis score was 90 to 35, and he was elder hand; but a momentous re-pique\ndecided it in favour of his adversary, who seemed to enjoy his victory\nmingled with regret, for having won too much, while his friend, with\ngreat ebullience of passion, many praises of his own good play, and many\nmalediction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the power of chance, took up the cards, and threw them\ninto the fire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nFRUITS OF THE DEAD SEA.\n\n\nTHE company he was engaged to meet were assembled in Fleet Street.  He\nhad walked some time along the Strand, amidst a crowd of those wretches\nwho wait the uncertain wages of prostitution, with ideas of pity suitable\nto the scene around him and the feelings he possessed, and had got as far\nas Somerset House, when one of them laid hold of his arm, and, with a\nvoice tremulous and faint, asked him for a pint of wine, in a manner more\nsupplicatory than is usual with those whom the infamy of their profession\nhas deprived of shame.  He turned round at the demand, and looked\nsteadfastly on the person who made it.\n\nShe was above the common size, and elegantly formed; her face was thin\nand hollow, and showed the remains of tarnished beauty.  Her eyes were\nblack, but had little of their lustre left; her cheeks had some paint\nlaid on without art, and productive of no advantage to her complexion,\nwhich exhibited a deadly paleness on the other parts of her face.\n\nHarley stood in the attitude of hesitation; which she, interpreting to\nher advantage, repeated her request, and endeavoured to force a leer of\ninvitation into her countenance.  He took her arm, and they walked on to\none of those obsequious taverns in the neighbourhood, where the dearness\nof the wine is a discharge in full for the character of the house.  From\nwhat impulse he did this we do not mean to enquire; as it has ever been\nagainst our nature to search for motives where bad ones are to be found.\nThey entered, and a waiter showed them a room, and placed a bottle of\nclaret on the table.\n\nHarley filled the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glass: which she had no sooner tasted, than\ndropping it on the floor, and eagerly catching his arm, her eye grew\nfixed, her lip assumed a clayey whiteness, and she fell back lifeless in\nher chair.\n\nHarley started from his seat, and, catching her in his arms, supported\nher from falling to the ground, looking wildly at the door, as if he\nwanted to run for assistance, but durst not leave the miserable creature.\nIt was not till some minutes after that it occurred to him to ring the\nbell, which at last, however, he thought of, and rung with repeated\nviolence even after the waiter appeared.  Luckily the waiter had his\nsenses somewhat more about him; and snatching up a bottle of water, which\nstood on a buffet at the end of the room, he sprinkled it over the hands\nand face of the dying figure before him.  She began to revive, and, with\nthe assistance of some hartshorn drops, which Harley now for the first\ntime drew from his pocket, was able to desire the waiter to bring her a\ncrust of bread, of which she swallowed some mouthfuls with the appearance\nof the keenest hunger.  The waiter withdrew: when turning to Harley,\nsobbing at the same time, and shedding tears, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nshe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I should have given you so much trouble; but you will pity me\nwhen I tell you that till now I have not tasted a morsel these two days\npast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He fixed his eyes on hers\u00e2\u0080\u0094every circumstance but the last was\nforgotten; and he took her hand with as much respect as if she had been a\nduchess.  It was ever the privilege of misfortune to be revered by\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo days!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I have fared sumptuously every day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\nwas reaching to the bell; she understood his meaning, and prevented him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you would give yourself no more trouble\nabout a wretch who does not wish to live; but, at present, I could not\neat a bit; my stomach even rose at the last mouthful of that crust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\noffered to call a chair, saying that he hoped a little rest would relieve\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He had one half-guinea left.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat at\npresent I should be able to make you an offer of no more than this paltry\nsum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She burst into tears: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour generosity, sir, is abused; to bestow\nit on me is to take it from the virtuous.  I have no title but misery to\nplead: misery of my own procuring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo more of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Harley;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is virtue in these tears; let the fruit of them be virtue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He\nrung, and ordered a chair.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I am the vilest of beings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not forgotten every virtue; gratitude, I hope, I shall still have\nleft, did I but know who is my benefactor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Harley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould I\never have an opportunity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall, and a glorious one too! your\nfuture conduct\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I do not mean to reproach you\u00e2\u0080\u0094if, I say\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will be the\nnoblest reward\u00e2\u0080\u0094I will do myself the pleasure of seeing you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Here\nthe waiter entered, and told them the chair was at the door; the lady\ninformed Harley of her lodgings, and he promised to wait on her at ten\nnext morning.\n\nHe led her to the chair, and returned to clear with the waiter, without\never once reflecting that he had no money in his pocket.  He was ashamed\nto make an excuse; yet an excuse must be made: he was beginning to frame\none, when the waiter cut him short by telling him that he could not run\nscores; but that, if he would leave his watch, or any other pledge, it\nwould be as safe as if it lay in his pocket.  Harley jumped at the\nproposal, and pulling out his watch, delivered it into his hands\nimmediately, and having, for once, had the precaution to take a note of\nthe lodging he intended to visit next morning, sallied forth with a blush\nof triumph on his face, without taking notice of the sneer of the waiter,\nwho, twirling the watch in his hand, made him a profound bow at the door,\nand whispered to a girl, who stood in the passage, something, in which\nthe word CULLY was honoured with a particular emphasis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\nHIS SKILL IN PHYSIOGNOMY IS DOUBTED.\n\n\nAFTER he had been some time with the company he had appointed to meet,\nand the last bottle was called for, he first recollected that he would be\nagain at a loss how to discharge his share of the reckoning.  He applied,\ntherefore, to one of them, with whom he was most intimate, acknowledging\nthat he had not a farthing of money about him; and, upon being jocularly\nasked the reason, acquainted them with the two adventures we have just\nnow related.  One of the company asked him if the old man in Hyde Park\ndid not wear a brownish coat, with a narrow gold edging, and his\ncompanion an old green frock, with a buff-coloured waistcoat.  Upon\nHarley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recollecting that they did, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou may be\nthankful you have come off so well; they are two as noted sharpers, in\ntheir way, as any in town, and but t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other night took me in for a much\nlarger sum.  I had some thoughts of applying to a justice, but one does\nnot like to be seen in those matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he could not but fancy the gentleman was mistaken,\nas he never saw a face promise more honesty than that of the old man he\nhad met with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis face!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a grave-looking man, when sat opposite to\nhim, squirting the juice of his tobacco obliquely into the grate.  There\nwas something very emphatical in the action, for it was followed by a\nburst of laughter round the table.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are\ndisposed to be merry; it may be as you imagine, for I confess myself\nignorant of the town; but there is one thing which makes me hear the loss\nof my money with temper: the young fellow who won it must have been\nmiserably poor; I observed him borrow money for the stake from his\nfriend: he had distress and hunger in his countenance: be his character\nwhat it may, his necessities at least plead for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  At this there was\na louder laugh than before.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the lawyer, one of whose\nconversations with Harley we have already recorded, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty\nfellow for you! to have heard him talk some nights ago, as I did, you\nmight have sworn he was a saint; yet now he games with sharpers, and\nloses his money, and is bubbled by a fine tale of the Dead Sea, and pawns\nhis watch; here are sanctified doings with a witness!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his friend on the other side of the table, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\nme advise you to be a little more cautious for the future; and as for\nfaces\u00e2\u0080\u0094you may look into them to know whether a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose be a long or a\nshort one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\nHE KEEPS HIS APPOINTMENT.\n\n\nTHE last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raillery of his companions was recalled to his\nremembrance when he awoke, and the colder homilies of prudence began to\nsuggest some things which were nowise favourable for a performance of his\npromise to the unfortunate female he had met with before.  He rose,\nuncertain of his purpose; but the torpor of such considerations was\nseldom prevalent over the warmth of his nature.  He walked some turns\nbackwards and forwards in his room; he recalled the languid form of the\nfainting wretch to his mind; he wept at the recollection of her tears.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I am the vilest of beings, I have not forgotten every virtue;\ngratitude, I hope, I shall still have left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He took a larger\nstride\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cPowers of mercy that surround me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo ye not smile\nupon deeds like these? to calculate the chances of deception is too\ntedious a business for the life of man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094The clock struck ten.\u00e2\u0080\u0094When he\nwas got down-stairs, he found that he had forgot the note of her\nlodgings; he gnawed his lips at the delay: he was fairly on the pavement,\nwhen he recollected having left his purse; he did but just prevent\nhimself from articulating an imprecation.  He rushed a second time up\ninto his chamber.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a wretch I am!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cere this time,\nperhaps\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas a perhaps not to be borne;\u00e2\u0080\u0094two vibrations of a pendulum\nwould have served him to lock his bureau; but they could not be spared.\n\nWhen he reached the house, and inquired for Miss Atkins (for that was the\nlady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name), he was shown up three pair of stairs, into a small room\nlighted by one narrow lattice, and patched round with shreds of\ndifferent-coloured paper.  In the darkest corner stood something like a\nbed, before which a tattered coverlet hung by way of curtain.  He had not\nwaited long when she appeared.  Her face had the glister of new-washed\ntears on it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ashamed, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you should have taken\nthis fresh piece of trouble about one so little worthy of it; but, to the\nhumane, I know there is a pleasure in goodness for its own sake: if you\nhave patience for the recital of my story, it may palliate, though it\ncannot excuse, my faults.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley bowed, as a sign of assent; and she\nbegan as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the daughter of an officer, whom a service of forty years had\nadvanced no higher than the rank of captain.  I have had hints from\nhimself, and been informed by others, that it was in some measure owing\nto those principles of rigid honour, which it was his boast to possess,\nand which he early inculcated on me, that he had been able to arrive at\nno better station.  My mother died when I was a child: old enough to\ngrieve for her death, but incapable of remembering her precepts.  Though\nmy father was doatingly fond of her, yet there were some sentiments in\nwhich they materially differed: she had been bred from her infancy in the\nstrictest principles of religion, and took the morality of her conduct\nfrom the motives which an adherence to those principles suggested.  My\nfather, who had been in the army from his youth, affixed an idea of\npusillanimity to that virtue, which was formed by the doctrines, excited\nby the rewards, or guarded by the terrors of revelation; his dashing idol\nwas the honour of a soldier: a term which he held in such reverence, that\nhe used it for his most sacred asseveration.  When my mother died, I was\nsome time suffered to continue in those sentiments which her instructions\nhad produced; but soon after, though, from respect to her memory, my\nfather did not absolutely ridicule them, yet he showed, in his discourse\nto others, so little regard to them, and at times suggested to me motives\nof action so different, that I was soon weaned from opinions which I\nbegan to consider as the dreams of superstition, or the artful inventions\nof designing hypocrisy.  My mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s books were left behind at the\ndifferent quarters we removed to, and my reading was principally confined\nto plays, novels, and those poetical descriptions of the beauty of virtue\nand honour, which the circulating libraries easily afforded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I was generally reckoned handsome, and the quickness of my parts\nextolled by all our visitors, my father had a pride in allowing me to the\nworld.  I was young, giddy, open to adulation, and vain of those talents\nwhich acquired it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the last war, my father was reduced to half-pay; with which we\nretired to a village in the country, which the acquaintance of some\ngenteel families who resided in it, and the cheapness of living,\nparticularly recommended.  My father rented a small house, with a piece\nof ground sufficient to keep a horse for him, and a cow for the benefit\nof his family.  An old man servant managed his ground; while a maid, who\nhad formerly been my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and had since been mine, undertook the\ncare of our little dairy: they were assisted in each of their provinces\nby my father and me: and we passed our time in a state of tranquillity,\nwhich he had always talked of with delight, and my train of reading had\ntaught me to admire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I had never seen the polite circles of the metropolis, the\ncompany my father had introduced me into had given me a degree of good\nbreeding, which soon discovered a superiority over the young ladies of\nour village.  I was quoted as an example of politeness, and my company\ncourted by most of the considerable families in the neighbourhood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmongst the houses where I was frequently invited was Sir George\nWinbrooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He had two daughters nearly of my age, with whom, though\nthey had been bred up in those maxims of vulgar doctrine which my\nsuperior understanding could not but despise, yet as their good nature\nled them to an imitation of my manners in everything else, I cultivated a\nparticular friendship.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome months after our first acquaintance, Sir George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son came\nhome from his travels.  His figure, his address, and conversation, were\nnot unlike those warm ideas of an accomplished man which my favourite\nnovels had taught me to form; and his sentiments on the article of\nreligion were as liberal as my own: when any of these happened to be the\ntopic of our discourse, I, who before had been silent, from a fear of\nbeing single in opposition, now kindled at the fire he raised, and\ndefended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence I was mistress of.\nHe would be respectfully attentive all the while; and when I had ended,\nwould raise his eyes from the ground, look at me with a gaze of\nadmiration, and express his applause in the highest strain of encomium.\nThis was an incense the more pleasing, as I seldom or never had met with\nit before; for the young gentlemen who visited Sir George were for the\nmost part of that athletic order, the pleasure of whose lives is derived\nfrom fox-hunting: these are seldom solicitous to please the women at all;\nor if they were, would never think of applying their flattery to the\nmind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Winbrooke observed the weakness of my soul, and took every occasion\nof improving the esteem he had gained.  He asked my opinion of every\nauthor, of every sentiment, with that submissive diffidence, which showed\nan unlimited confidence in my understanding.  I saw myself revered, as a\nsuperior being, by one whose judgment my vanity told me was not likely to\nerr: preferred by him to all the other visitors of my sex, whose fortunes\nand rank should have entitled them to a much higher degree of notice: I\nsaw their little jealousies at the distinguished attention he paid me; it\nwas gratitude, it was pride, it was love!  Love which had made too fatal\na progress in my heart, before any declaration on his part should have\nwarranted a return: but I interpreted every look of attention, every\nexpression of compliment, to the passion I imagined him inspired with,\nand imputed to his sensibility that silence which was the effect of art\nand design.  At length, however, he took an opportunity of declaring his\nlove: he now expressed himself in such ardent terms, that prudence might\nhave suspected their sincerity: but prudence is rarely found in the\nsituation I had been unguardedly led into; besides, that the course of\nreading to which I had been accustomed, did not lead me to conclude, that\nhis expressions could be too warm to be sincere: nor was I even alarmed\nat the manner in which he talked of marriage, a subjection, he often\nhinted, to which genuine love should scorn to be confined.  The woman, he\nwould often say, who had merit like mine to fix his affection, could\neasily command it for ever.  That honour too which I revered, was often\ncalled in to enforce his sentiments.  I did not, however, absolutely\nassent to them; but I found my regard for their opposites diminish by\ndegrees.  If it is dangerous to be convinced, it is dangerous to listen;\nfor our reason is so much of a machine, that it will not always be able\nto resist, when the ear is perpetually assailed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short, Mr. Harley (for I tire you with a relation, the catastrophe of\nwhich you will already have imagined), I fell a prey to his artifices.\nHe had not been able so thoroughly to convert me, that my conscience was\nsilent on the subject; but he was so assiduous to give repeated proofs of\nunabated affection, that I hushed its suggestions as they rose.  The\nworld, however, I knew, was not to be silenced; and therefore I took\noccasion to express my uneasiness to my seducer, and entreat him, as he\nvalued the peace of one to whom he professed such attachment, to remove\nit by a marriage.  He made excuse from his dependence on the will of his\nfather, but quieted my fears by the promise of endeavouring to win his\nassent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father had been some days absent on a visit to a dying relation, from\nwhom he had considerable expectations.  I was left at home, with no other\ncompany than my books: my books I found were not now such companions as\nthey used to be; I was restless, melancholy, unsatisfied with myself.\nBut judge my situation when I received a billet from Mr. Winbrooke\ninforming me, that he had sounded Sir George on the subject we had talked\nof, and found him so averse to any match so unequal to his own rank and\nfortune, that he was obliged, with whatever reluctance, to bid adieu to a\nplace, the remembrance of which should ever be dear to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI read this letter a hundred times over.  Alone, helpless, conscious of\nguilt, and abandoned by every better thought, my mind was one motley\nscene of terror, confusion, and remorse.  A thousand expedients suggested\nthemselves, and a thousand fears told me they would be vain: at last, in\nan agony of despair, I packed up a few clothes, took what money and\ntrinkets were in the house, and set out for London, whither I understood\nhe was gone; pretending to my maid, that I had received letters from my\nfather requiring my immediate attendance.  I had no other companion than\na boy, a servant to the man from whom I hired my horses.  I arrived in\nLondon within an hour of Mr. Winbrooke, and accidentally alighted at the\nvery inn where he was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe started and turned pale when he saw me; but recovered himself in time\nenough to make many new protestations of regard, and beg me to make\nmyself easy under a disappointment which was equally afflicting to him.\nHe procured me lodgings, where I slept, or rather endeavoured to sleep,\nfor that night.  Next morning I saw him again, he then mildly observed on\nthe imprudence of my precipitate flight from the country, and proposed my\nremoving to lodgings at another end of the town, to elude the search of\nmy father, till he should fall upon some method of excusing my conduct to\nhim, and reconciling him to my return.  We took a hackney-coach, and\ndrove to the house he mentioned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was situated in a dirty lane, furnished with a tawdry affectation of\nfinery, with some old family pictures hanging on walls which their own\ncobwebs would better have suited.  I was struck with a secret dread at\nentering, nor was it lessened by the appearance of the landlady, who had\nthat look of selfish shrewdness, which, of all others, is the most\nhateful to those whose feelings are untinctured with the world.  A girl,\nwho she told us was her niece, sat by her, playing on a guitar, while\nherself was at work, with the assistance of spectacles, and had a\nprayer-book with the leaves folded down in several places, lying on the\ntable before her.  Perhaps, sir, I tire you with my minuteness, but the\nplace, and every circumstance about it, is so impressed on my mind, that\nI shall never forget it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dined that day with Mr. Winbrooke alone.  He lost by degrees that\nrestraint which I perceived too well to hang about him before, and, with\nhis former gaiety and good humour, repeated the flattering things which,\nthough they had once been fatal, I durst not now distrust.  At last,\ntaking my hand and kissing it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is thus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that love will\nlast, while freedom is preserved; thus let us ever be blessed, without\nthe galling thought that we are tied to a condition where we may cease to\nbe so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI answered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098That the world thought otherwise: that it had certain ideas\nof good fame, which it was impossible not to wish to maintain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098The world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is a tyrant, they are slaves who obey it; let us\nbe happy without the pale of the world.  To-morrow I shall leave this\nquarter of it, for one where the talkers of the world shall be foiled,\nand lose us.  Could not my Emily accompany me? my friend, my companion,\nthe mistress of my soul!  Nay, do not look so, Emily!  Your father may\ngrieve for a while, but your father shall be taken care of; this\nbank-bill I intend as the comfort for his daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI could contain myself no longer: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wretch,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098dost thou\nimagine that my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart could brook dependence on the destroyer of\nhis child, and tamely accept of a base equivalent for her honour and his\nown?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Honour, my Emily,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is the word of fools, or of those wiser\nmen who cheat them.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a fantastic bauble that does not suit the\ngravity of your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age; but, whatever it is, I am afraid it can\nnever be perfectly restored to you: exchange the word then, and let\npleasure be your object now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt these words he clasped me in his arms, and pressed his lips rudely to\nmy bosom.  I started from my seat.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perfidious villain!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098who\ndar\u00e2\u0080\u0099st insult the weakness thou hast undone; were that father here, thy\ncoward soul would shrink from the vengeance of his honour!  Cursed be\nthat wretch who has deprived him of it! oh doubly cursed, who has dragged\non his hoary head the infamy which should have crushed her own!\u00e2\u0080\u0099  I\nsnatched a knife which lay beside me, and would have plunged it in my\nbreast, but the monster prevented my purpose, and smiling with a grin of\nbarbarous insult\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Madam,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I confess you are rather too much in heroics for me;\nI am sorry we should differ about trifles; but as I seem somehow to have\noffended you, I would willingly remedy it by taking my leave.  You have\nbeen put to some foolish expense in this journey on my account; allow me\nto reimburse you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo saying he laid a bank-bill, of what amount I had no patience to see,\nupon the table.  Shame, grief, and indignation choked my utterance;\nunable to speak my wrongs, and unable to bear them in silence, I fell in\na swoon at his feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened in the interval I cannot tell, but when I came to myself I\nwas in the arms of the landlady, with her niece chafing my temples, and\ndoing all in her power for my recovery.  She had much compassion in her\ncountenance; the old woman assumed the softest look she was capable of,\nand both endeavoured to bring me comfort.  They continued to show me many\ncivilities, and even the aunt began to be less disagreeable in my sight.\nTo the wretched, to the forlorn, as I was, small offices of kindness are\nendearing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeantime my money was far spent, nor did I attempt to conceal my wants\nfrom their knowledge.  I had frequent thoughts of returning to my father;\nbut the dread of a life of scorn is insurmountable.  I avoided,\ntherefore, going abroad when I had a chance of being seen by any former\nacquaintance, nor indeed did my health for a great while permit it; and\nsuffered the old woman, at her own suggestion, to call me niece at home,\nwhere we now and then saw (when they could prevail on me to leave my\nroom) one or two other elderly women, and sometimes a grave business-like\nman, who showed great compassion for my indisposition, and made me very\nobligingly an offer of a room at his country-house for the recovery of my\nhealth.  This offer I did not chose to accept, but told my landlady,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098that I should be glad to be employed in any way of business which my\nskill in needlework could recommend me to, confessing, at the same time,\nthat I was afraid I should scarce be able to pay her what I already owed\nfor board and lodging, and that for her other good offices, I had nothing\nbut thanks to give her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear child,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she, \u00e2\u0080\u0098do not talk of paying; since I lost my own\nsweet girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (here she wept), \u00e2\u0080\u0098your very picture she was, Miss Emily, I\nhave nobody, except my niece, to whom I should leave any little thing I\nhave been able to save; you shall live with me, my dear; and I have\nsometimes a little millinery work, in which, when you are inclined to it,\nyou may assist us.  By the way, here are a pair of ruffles we have just\nfinished for that gentleman you saw here at tea; a distant relation of\nmine, and a worthy man he is.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas pity you refused the offer of an\napartment at his country house; my niece, you know, was to have\naccompanied you, and you might have fancied yourself at home; a most\nsweet place it is, and but a short mile beyond Hampstead.  Who knows,\nMiss Emily, what effect such a visit might have had!  If I had half your\nbeauty I should not waste it pining after e\u00e2\u0080\u0099er a worthless fellow of them\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI felt my heart swell at her words; I would have been angry if I could,\nbut I was in that stupid state which is not easily awakened to anger:\nwhen I would have chid her the reproof stuck in my throat; I could only\nweep!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer want of respect increased, as I had not spirit to assert it.  My\nwork was now rather imposed than offered, and I became a drudge for the\nbread I eat: but my dependence and servility grew in proportion, and I\nwas now in a situation which could not make any extraordinary exertions\nto disengage itself from either\u00e2\u0080\u0094I found myself with child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt last the wretch, who had thus trained me to destruction, hinted the\npurpose for which those means had been used.  I discovered her to be an\nartful procuress for the pleasures of those who are men of decency to the\nworld in the midst of debauchery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI roused every spark of courage within me at the horrid proposal.  She\ntreated my passion at first somewhat mildly, but when I continued to\nexert it she resented it with insult, and told me plainly that if I did\nnot soon comply with her desires I should pay her every farthing I owed,\nor rot in a jail for life.  I trembled at the thought; still, however, I\nresisted her importunities, and she put her threats in execution.  I was\nconveyed to prison, weak from my condition, weaker from that struggle of\ngrief and misery which for some time I had suffered.  A miscarriage was\nthe consequence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmidst all the horrors of such a state, surrounded with wretches totally\ncallous, lost alike to humanity and to shame, think, Mr. Harley, think\nwhat I endured; nor wonder that I at last yielded to the solicitations of\nthat miscreant I had seen at her house, and sunk to the prostitution\nwhich he tempted.  But that was happiness compared to what I have\nsuffered since.  He soon abandoned me to the common use of the town, and\nI was cast among those miserable beings in whose society I have since\nremained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! did the daughters of virtue know our sufferings; did they see our\nhearts torn with anguish amidst the affectation of gaiety which our faces\nare obliged to assume! our bodies tortured by disease, our minds with\nthat consciousness which they cannot lose!  Did they know, did they think\nof this, Mr. Harley!  Their censures are just, but their pity perhaps\nmight spare the wretches whom their justice should condemn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLast night, but for an exertion of benevolence which the infection of\nour infamy prevents even in the humane, had I been thrust out from this\nmiserable place which misfortune has yet left me; exposed to the brutal\ninsults of drunkenness, or dragged by that justice which I could not\nbribe, to the punishment which may correct, but, alas! can never amend\nthe abandoned objects of its terrors.  From that, Mr. Harley, your\ngoodness has relieved me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe beckoned with his hand: he would have stopped the mention of his\nfavours; but he could not speak, had it been to beg a diadem.\n\nShe saw his tears; her fortitude began to fail at the sight, when the\nvoice of some stranger on the stairs awakened her attention.  She\nlistened for a moment, then starting up, exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMerciful God! my\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had scarce uttered the word, when the door burst open, and a man\nentered in the garb of an officer.  When he discovered his daughter and\nHarley, he started back a few paces; his look assumed a furious wildness!\nhe laid his hand on his sword.  The two objects of his wrath did not\nutter a syllable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVillain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthou seest a father who had once a daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhonour to preserve; blasted as it now is, behold him ready to avenge its\nloss!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley had by this time some power of utterance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\nwill be a moment calm\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cInfamous coward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdost thou preach calmness to\nwrongs like mine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe drew his sword.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me tell you\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the blood ran quicker to his cheek,\nhis pulse beat one, no more, and regained the temperament of\nhumanity\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are deceived, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are much deceived; but I\nforgive suspicions which your misfortunes have justified: I would not\nwrong you, upon my soul I would not, for the dearest gratification of a\nthousand worlds; my heart bleeds for you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis daughter was now prostrate at his feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStrike,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrike here a wretch, whose misery cannot end but\nwith that death she deserves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer hair had fallen on her shoulders! her look had the horrid calmness of\nout-breathed despair!  Her father would have spoken; his lip quivered,\nhis cheek grew pale, his eyes lost the lightning of their fury! there was\na reproach in them, but with a mingling of pity.  He turned them up to\nheaven, then on his daughter.  He laid his left hand on his heart, the\nsword dropped from his right, he burst into tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\nTHE DISTRESSES OF A FATHER.\n\n\nHARLEY kneeled also at the side of the unfortunate daughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAllow me, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto entreat your pardon for one whose offences\nhave been already so signally punished.  I know, I feel, that those\ntears, wrung from the heart of a father, are more dreadful to her than\nall the punishments your sword could have inflicted: accept the\ncontrition of a child whom heaven has restored to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she not lost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cirrecoverably lost?  Damnation! a common\nprostitute to the meanest ruffian!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCalmly, my dear sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you know by what complicated\nmisfortunes she had fallen to that miserable state in which you now\nbehold her, I should have no need of words to excite your compassion.\nThink, sir, of what once she was.  Would you abandon her to the insults\nof an unfeeling world, deny her opportunity of penitence, and cut off the\nlittle comfort that still remains for your afflictions and her own!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, addressing himself to his daughter; \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeak; I will hear\nthee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe desperation that supported her was lost; she fell to the ground, and\nbathed his feet with her tears.\n\nHarley undertook her cause: he related the treacheries to which she had\nfallen a sacrifice, and again solicited the forgiveness of her father.\nHe looked on her for some time in silence; the pride of a soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhonour checked for a while the yearnings of his heart; but nature at last\nprevailed, he fell on her neck and mingled his tears with hers.\n\nHarley, who discovered from the dress of the stranger that he was just\narrived from a journey, begged that they would both remove to his\nlodgings, till he could procure others for them.  Atkins looked at him\nwith some marks of surprise.  His daughter now first recovered the power\nof speech.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWretch as I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyet there is some gratitude due to the\npreserver of your child.  See him now before you.  To him I owe my life,\nor at least the comfort of imploring your forgiveness before I die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPardon me, young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Atkins, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear my passion wronged\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever, never, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it had, your reconciliation to your\ndaughter were an atonement a thousand fold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He then repeated his\nrequest that he might be allowed to conduct them to his lodgings, to\nwhich Mr. Atkins at last consented.  He took his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my Emily,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe can never, never recover that happiness we\nhave lost! but time may teach us to remember our misfortunes with\npatience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they arrived at the house where Harley lodged, he was informed that\nthe first floor was then vacant, and that the gentleman and his daughter\nmight be accommodated there.  While he was upon his enquiry, Miss Atkins\ninformed her father more particularly what she owed to his benevolence.\nWhen he turned into the room where they were Atkins ran and embraced\nhim;\u00e2\u0080\u0094begged him again to forgive the offence he had given him, and made\nthe warmest protestations of gratitude for his favours.  We would attempt\nto describe the joy which Harley felt on this occasion, did it not occur\nto us that one half of the world could not understand it though we did,\nand the other half will, by this time, have understood it without any\ndescription at all.\n\nMiss Atkins now retired to her chamber, to take some rest from the\nviolence of the emotions she had suffered.  When she was gone, her\nfather, addressing himself to Harley, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a right, sir, to be\ninformed of the present situation of one who owes so much to your\ncompassion for his misfortunes.  My daughter I find has informed you what\nthat was at the fatal juncture when they began.  Her distresses you have\nheard, you have pitied as they deserved; with mine, perhaps, I cannot so\neasily make you acquainted.  You have a feeling heart, Mr. Harley; I\nbless it that it has saved my child; but you never were a father, a\nfather torn by that most dreadful of calamities, the dishonour of a child\nhe doated on!  You have been already informed of some of the\ncircumstances of her elopement: I was then from home, called by the death\nof a relation, who, though he would never advance me a shilling on the\nutmost exigency in his life-time, left me all the gleanings of his\nfrugality at his death.  I would not write this intelligence to my\ndaughter, because I intended to be the bearer myself; and as soon as my\nbusiness would allow me, I set out on my return, winged with all the\nhaste of paternal affection.  I fondly built those schemes of future\nhappiness, which present prosperity is ever busy to suggest: my Emily was\nconcerned in them all.  As I approached our little dwelling my heart\nthrobbed with the anticipation of joy and welcome.  I imagined the\ncheering fire, the blissful contentment of a frugal meal, made luxurious\nby a daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile, I painted to myself her surprise at the tidings of\nour new-acquired riches, our fond disputes about the disposal of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe road was shortened by the dreams of happiness I enjoyed, and it\nbegan to be dark as I reached the house: I alighted from my horse, and\nwalked softly upstairs to the room we commonly sat in.  I was somewhat\ndisappointed at not finding my daughter there.  I rung the bell; her maid\nappeared, and shewed no small signs of wonder at the summons.  She\nblessed herself as she entered the room: I smiled at her surprise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is Miss Emily, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Emily!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, sir; she has been gone hence some days, upon receipt of those\nletters you sent her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Letters!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, sir, so she told me, and went off in all haste that very night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI stood aghast as she spoke, but was able so far to recollect myself, as\nto put on the affectation of calmness, and telling her there was\ncertainly some mistake in the affair, desired her to leave me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen she was gone, I threw myself into a chair, in that state of\nuncertainty which is, of all others, the most dreadful.  The gay visions\nwith which I had delighted myself, vanished in an instant.  I was\ntortured with tracing back the same circle of doubt and disappointment.\nMy head grew dizzy as I thought.  I called the servant again, and asked\nher a hundred questions, to no purpose; there was not room even for\nconjecture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething at last arose in my mind, which we call Hope, without knowing\nwhat it is.  I wished myself deluded by it; but it could not prevail over\nmy returning fears.  I rose and walked through the room.  My Emily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nspinnet stood at the end of it, open, with a book of music folded down at\nsome of my favourite lessons.  I touched the keys; there was a vibration\nin the sound that froze my blood; I looked around, and methought the\nfamily pictures on the walls gazed on me with compassion in their faces.\nI sat down again with an attempt at more composure; I started at every\ncreaking of the door, and my ears rung with imaginary noises!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had not remained long in this situation, when the arrival of a friend,\nwho had accidentally heard of my return, put an end to my doubts, by the\nrecital of my daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dishonour.  He told me he had his information\nfrom a young gentleman, to whom Winbrooke had boasted of having seduced\nher.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI started from my seat, with broken curses on my lips, and without\nknowing whither I should pursue them, ordered my servant to load my\npistols and saddle my horses.  My friend, however, with great difficulty,\npersuaded me to compose myself for that night, promising to accompany me\non the morrow, to Sir George Winbrooke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in quest of his son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe morrow came, after a night spent in a state little distant from\nmadness.  We went as early as decency would allow to Sir George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He\nreceived me with politeness, and indeed compassion, protested his\nabhorrence of his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct, and told me that he had set out some\ndays before for London, on which place he had procured a draft for a\nlarge sum, on pretence of finishing his travels, but that he had not\nheard from him since his departure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not wait for any more, either of information or comfort, but,\nagainst the united remonstrances of Sir George and my friend, set out\ninstantly for London, with a frantic uncertainty of purpose; but there,\nall manner of search was in vain.  I could trace neither of them any\nfarther than the inn where they first put up on their arrival; and after\nsome days fruitless inquiry, returned home destitute of every little hope\nthat had hitherto supported me.  The journeys I had made, the restless\nnights I had spent, above all, the perturbation of my mind, had the\neffect which naturally might be expected\u00e2\u0080\u0094a very dangerous fever was the\nconsequence.  From this, however, contrary to the expectation of my\nphysicians, I recovered.  It was now that I first felt something like\ncalmness of mind: probably from being reduced to a state which could not\nproduce the exertions of anguish or despair.  A stupid melancholy settled\non my soul; I could endure to live with an apathy of life; at times I\nforgot my resentment, and wept at the remembrance of my child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuch has been the tenor of my days since that fatal moment when these\nmisfortunes began, till yesterday, that I received a letter from a friend\nin town, acquainting me of her present situation.  Could such tales as\nmine, Mr. Harley, be sometimes suggested to the daughters of levity, did\nthey but know with what anxiety the heart of a parent flutters round the\nchild he loves, they would be less apt to construe into harshness that\ndelicate concern for their conduct, which they often complain of as\nlaying restraint upon things, to the young, the gay, and the thoughtless,\nseemingly harmless and indifferent.  Alas!  I fondly imagined that I\nneeded not even these common cautions! my Emily was the joy of my age,\nand the pride of my soul!  Those things are now no more, they are lost\nfor ever!  Her death I could have born, but the death of her honour has\nadded obloquy and shame to that sorrow which bends my grey hairs to the\ndust!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke these last words, his voice trembled in his throat; it was\nnow lost in his tears.  He sat with his face half turned from Harley, as\nif he would have hid the sorrow which he felt.  Harley was in the same\nattitude himself; he durst not meet his eye with a tear, but gathering\nhis stifled breath, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me entreat you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto hope better\nthings.  The world is ever tyrannical; it warps our sorrows to edge them\nwith keener affliction.  Let us not be slaves to the names it affixes to\nmotive or to action.  I know an ingenuous mind cannot help feeling when\nthey sting.  But there are considerations by which it may be overcome.\nIts fantastic ideas vanish as they rise; they teach us to look beyond\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n\n\nA FRAGMENT.\nSHOWING HIS SUCCESS WITH THE BARONET.\n\n\n* * THE card he received was in the politest style in which\ndisappointment could be communicated.  The baronet \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas under a necessity\nof giving up his application for Mr. Harley, as he was informed that the\nlease was engaged for a gentleman who had long served His Majesty in\nanother capacity, and whose merit had entitled him to the first lucrative\nthing that should be vacant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Even Harley could not murmur at such a\ndisposal.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome war-worn officer, who,\nlike poor Atkins, had been neglected from reasons which merited the\nhighest advancement; whose honour could not stoop to solicit the\npreferment he deserved; perhaps, with a family, taught the principles of\ndelicacy, without the means of supporting it; a wife and\nchildren\u00e2\u0080\u0094gracious heaven! whom my wishes would have deprived of bread\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was interrupted in his reverie by some one tapping him on the\nshoulder, and, on turning round, he discovered it to be the very man who\nhad explained to him the condition of his gay companion at Hyde Park\nCorner.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad to see you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe we are fellows\nin disappointment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley started, and said that he was at a loss to\nunderstand him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cPooh! you need not be so shy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the other;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cevery one for himself is but fair, and I had much rather you had got it\nthan the rascally gauger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley still protested his ignorance of what\nhe meant.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, the lease of Bancroft Manor; had not you been applying\nfor it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI confess I was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I cannot conceive how\nyou should be interested in the matter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I was making interest for\nit myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I think I had some title.  I voted for this\nsame baronet at the last election, and made some of my friends do so too;\nthough I would not have you imagine that I sold my vote.  No, I scorn it,\nlet me tell you I scorn it; but I thought as how this man was staunch and\ntrue, and I find he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but a double-faced fellow after all, and\nspeechifies in the House for any side he hopes to make most by.  Oh, how\nmany fine speeches and squeezings by the hand we had of him on the\ncanvas!  \u00e2\u0080\u0098And if ever I shall be so happy as to have an opportunity of\nserving you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  A murrain on the smooth-tongued knave, and after all to\nget it for this pimp of a gauger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gauger! there must be some\nmistake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe writes me, that it was engaged for one whose\nlong services\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cServices!\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall hear.\nServices!  Yes, his sister arrived in town a few days ago, and is now\nsempstress to the baronet.  A plague on all rogues, says honest Sam\nWrightson.  I shall but just drink damnation to them to-night, in a\ncrown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of Ashley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and leave London to-morrow by sun-rise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshall leave it too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley; and so he accordingly did.\n\nIn passing through Piccadilly, he had observed, on the window of an inn,\na notification of the departure of a stage-coach for a place in his road\nhomewards; in the way back to his lodgings, he took a seat in it for his\nreturn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\nHE LEAVES LONDON\u00e2\u0080\u0094CHARACTERS IN A STAGE-COACH.\n\n\nTHE company in the stage-coach consisted of a grocer and his wife, who\nwere going to pay a visit to some of their country friends; a young\nofficer, who took this way of marching to quarters; a middle-aged\ngentlewoman, who had been hired as housekeeper to some family in the\ncountry; and an elderly, well-looking man, with a remarkable\nold-fashioned periwig.\n\nHarley, upon entering, discovered but one vacant seat, next the grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwife, which, from his natural shyness of temper, he made no scruple to\noccupy, however aware that riding backwards always disagreed with him.\n\nThough his inclination to physiognomy had met with some rubs in the\nmetropolis, he had not yet lost his attachment to that science.  He set\nhimself, therefore, to examine, as usual, the countenances of his\ncompanions.  Here, indeed, he was not long in doubt as to the preference;\nfor besides that the elderly gentleman, who sat opposite to him, had\nfeatures by nature more expressive of good dispositions, there was\nsomething in that periwig we mentioned, peculiarly attractive of Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nregard.\n\nHe had not been long employed in these speculations, when he found\nhimself attacked with that faintish sickness, which was the natural\nconsequence of his situation in the coach.  The paleness of his\ncountenance was first observed by the housekeeper, who immediately made\noffer of her smelling bottle, which Harley, however, declined, telling at\nthe same time the cause of his uneasiness.  The gentleman, on the\nopposite side of the coach, now first turned his eye from the side\ndirection in which it had been fixed, and begged Harley to exchange\nplaces with him, expressing his regret that he had not made the proposal\nbefore.  Harley thanked him, and, upon being assured that both seats were\nalike to him, was about to accept of his offer, when the young gentleman\nof the sword, putting on an arch look, laid hold of the other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, my old boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI find you have still some youthful blood\nabout you, but, with your leave, I will do myself the honour of sitting\nby this lady;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took his place accordingly.  The grocer stared him as\nfull in the face as his own short neck would allow, and his wife, who was\na little, round-faced woman, with a great deal of colour in her cheeks,\ndrew up at the compliment that was paid her, looking first at the\nofficer, and then at the housekeeper.\n\nThis incident was productive of some discourse; for before, though there\nwas sometimes a cough or a hem from the grocer, and the officer now and\nthen humm\u00e2\u0080\u0099d a few notes of a song, there had not a single word passed the\nlips of any of the company.\n\nMrs. Grocer observed, how ill-convenient it was for people, who could not\nbe drove backwards, to travel in a stage.  This brought on a dissertation\non stage-coaches in general, and the pleasure of keeping a chay of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nown; which led to another, on the great riches of Mr. Deputy Bearskin,\nwho, according to her, had once been of that industrious order of youths\nwho sweep the crossings of the streets for the conveniency of passengers,\nbut, by various fortunate accidents, had now acquired an immense fortune,\nand kept his coach and a dozen livery servants.  All this afforded ample\nfund for conversation, if conversation it might be called, that was\ncarried on solely by the before-mentioned lady, nobody offering to\ninterrupt her, except that the officer sometimes signified his\napprobation by a variety of oaths, a sort of phraseology in which he\nseemed extremely versant.  She appealed indeed, frequently, to her\nhusband for the authenticity of certain facts, of which the good man as\noften protested his total ignorance; but as he was always called fool, or\nsomething very like it, for his pains, he at last contrived to support\nthe credit of his wife without prejudice to his conscience, and signified\nhis assent by a noise not unlike the grunting of that animal which in\nshape and fatness he somewhat resembled.\n\nThe housekeeper, and the old gentleman who sat next to Harley, were now\nobserved to be fast asleep, at which the lady, who had been at such pains\nto entertain them, muttered some words of displeasure, and, upon the\nofficer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whispering to smoke the old put, both she and her husband\npurs\u00e2\u0080\u0099d up their mouths into a contemptuous smile.  Harley looked sternly\non the grocer.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are come, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto those years when you\nmight have learned some reverence for age.  As for this young man, who\nhas so lately escaped from the nursery, he may be allowed to divert\nhimself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDam\u00e2\u0080\u0099me, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the officer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you call me young?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nstriking up the front of his hat, and stretching forward on his seat,\ntill his face almost touched Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  It is probable, however, that he\ndiscovered something there which tended to pacify him, for, on the ladies\nentreating them not to quarrel, he very soon resumed his posture and\ncalmness together, and was rather less profuse of his oaths during the\nrest of the journey.\n\nIt is possible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear the last\npart of this discourse; at least (whether from that cause, or that he too\nwas a physiognomist) he wore a look remarkably complacent to Harley, who,\non his part, shewed a particular observance of him.  Indeed, they had\nsoon a better opportunity of making their acquaintance, as the coach\narrived that night at the town where the officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regiment lay, and the\nplaces of destination of their other fellow-travellers, it seems, were at\nno great distance, for, next morning, the old gentleman and Harley were\nthe only passengers remaining.\n\nWhen they left the inn in the morning, Harley, pulling out a little\npocket-book, began to examine the contents, and make some corrections\nwith a pencil.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, turning to his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis an\namusement with which I sometimes pass idle hours at an inn.  These are\nquotations from those humble poets, who trust their fame to the brittle\ntenure of windows and drinking-glasses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our inn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the\ngentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca stranger might imagine that we were a nation of poets;\nmachines, at least, containing poetry, which the motion of a journey\nemptied of their contents.  Is it from the vanity of being thought\ngeniuses, or a mere mechanical imitation of the custom of others, that we\nare tempted to scrawl rhyme upon such places?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether vanity is the cause of our becoming rhymesters or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered\nHarley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a pretty certain effect of it.  An old man of my\nacquaintance, who deals in apothegms, used to say that he had known few\nmen without envy, few wits without ill-nature, and no poet without\nvanity; and I believe his remark is a pretty just one.  Vanity has been\nimmemorially the charter of poets.  In this, the ancients were more\nhonest than we are.  The old poets frequently make boastful predictions\nof the immortality their works shall acquire them; ours, in their\ndedications and prefatory discourses, employ much eloquence to praise\ntheir patrons, and much seeming modesty to condemn themselves, or at\nleast to apologise for their productions to the world.  But this, in my\nopinion, is the more assuming manner of the two; for of all the garbs I\never saw Pride put on, that of her humility is to me the most\ndisgusting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is natural enough for a poet to be vain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nlittle worlds which he raises, the inspiration which he claims, may\neasily be productive of self-importance; though that inspiration is\nfabulous, it brings on egotism, which is always the parent of vanity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt may be supposed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat inspiration of old was an\narticle of religious faith; in modern times it may be translated a\npropensity to compose; and I believe it is not always most readily found\nwhere the poets have fixed its residence, amidst groves and plains, and\nthe scenes of pastoral retirement.  The mind may be there unbent from the\ncares of the world, but it will frequently, at the same time, be unnerved\nfrom any great exertion.  It will feel imperfect, and wander without\neffort over the regions of reflection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cone advantage in the poetical\ninclination, that it is an incentive to philanthropy.  There is a certain\npoetic ground, on which a man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge\nthe heart: the causes of human depravity vanish before the romantic\nenthusiasm he professes, and many who are not able to reach the\nParnassian heights, may yet approach so near as to be bettered by the air\nof the climate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have always thought so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut this is an argument with\nthe prudent against it: they urge the danger of unfitness for the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI allow it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I believe it is not always\nrightfully imputed to the bent for poetry: that is only one effect of the\ncommon cause.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jack, says his father, is indeed no scholar; nor could all\nthe drubbings from his master ever bring him one step forward in his\naccidence or syntax: but I intend him for a merchant.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Allow the same\nindulgence to Tom.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tom reads Virgil and Horace when he should be casting\naccounts; and but t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other day he pawned his great-coat for an edition of\nShakespeare.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But Tom would have been as he is, though Virgil and Horace\nhad never been born, though Shakespeare had died a link-boy; for his\nnurse will tell you, that when he was a child, he broke his rattle, to\ndiscover what it was that sounded within it; and burnt the sticks of his\ngo-cart, because he liked to see the sparkling of timber in the\nfire.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a sad case; but what is to be done?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why, Jack shall make a\nfortune, dine on venison, and drink claret.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ay, but Tom\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tom shall dine\nwith his brother, when his pride will let him; at other times, he shall\nbless God over a half-pint of ale and a Welsh-rabbit; and both shall go\nto heaven as they may.\u00e2\u0080\u0094That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a poor prospect for Tom, says the\nfather.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To go to heaven!  I cannot agree with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe now-a-days discourage the romantic turn a\nlittle too much.  Our boys are prudent too soon.  Mistake me not, I do\nnot mean to blame them for want of levity or dissipation; but their\npleasures are those of hackneyed vice, blunted to every finer emotion by\nthe repetition of debauch; and their desire of pleasure is warped to the\ndesire of wealth, as the means of procuring it.  The immense riches\nacquired by individuals have erected a standard of ambition, destructive\nof private morals, and of public virtue.  The weaknesses of vice are left\nus; but the most allowable of our failings we are taught to despise.\nLove, the passion most natural to the sensibility of youth, has lost the\nplaintive dignity he once possessed, for the unmeaning simper of a\ndangling coxcomb; and the only serious concern, that of a dowry, is\nsettled, even amongst the beardless leaders of the dancing-school.  The\nFrivolous and the Interested (might a satirist say) are the\ncharacteristical features of the age; they are visible even in the essays\nof our philosophers.  They laugh at the pedantry of our fathers, who\ncomplained of the times in which they lived; they are at pains to\npersuade us how much those were deceived; they pride themselves in\ndefending things as they find them, and in exploding the barren sounds\nwhich had been reared into motives for action.  To this their style is\nsuited; and the manly tone of reason is exchanged for perpetual efforts\nat sneer and ridicule.  This I hold to be an alarming crisis in the\ncorruption of a state; when not only is virtue declined, and vice\nprevailing, but when the praises of virtue are forgotten, and the infamy\nof vice unfelt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey soon after arrived at the next inn upon the route of the\nstage-coach, when the stranger told Harley, that his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, to\nwhich he was returning, lay at no great distance, and he must therefore\nunwillingly bid him adieu.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, taking his hand, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto have some word to\nremember so much seeming worth by: my name is Harley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall remember it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old gentleman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin my prayers; mine\nis Silton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Silton indeed it was!  Ben Silton himself!  Once more, my honoured\nfriend, farewell!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Born to be happy without the world, to that peaceful\nhappiness which the world has not to bestow!  Envy never scowled on thy\nlife, nor hatred smiled on thy grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\nHE MEETS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n\nWHEN the stage-coach arrived at the place of its destination, Harley\nbegan to consider how he should proceed the remaining part of his\njourney.  He was very civilly accosted by the master of the inn, who\noffered to accommodate him either with a post-chaise or horses, to any\ndistance he had a mind: but as he did things frequently in a way\ndifferent from what other people call natural, he refused these offers,\nand set out immediately a-foot, having first put a spare shirt in his\npocket, and given directions for the forwarding of his portmanteau.  This\nwas a method of travelling which he was accustomed to take: it saved the\ntrouble of provision for any animal but himself, and left him at liberty\nto chose his quarters, either at an inn, or at the first cottage in which\nhe saw a face he liked: nay, when he was not peculiarly attracted by the\nreasonable creation, he would sometimes consort with a species of\ninferior rank, and lay himself down to sleep by the side of a rock, or on\nthe banks of a rivulet.  He did few things without a motive, but his\nmotives were rather eccentric: and the useful and expedient were terms\nwhich he held to be very indefinite, and which therefore he did not\nalways apply to the sense in which they are commonly understood.\n\nThe sun was now in his decline, and the evening remarkably serene, when\nhe entered a hollow part of the road, which winded between the\nsurrounding banks, and seamed the sward in different lines, as the choice\nof travellers had directed them to tread it.  It seemed to be little\nfrequented now, for some of those had partly recovered their former\nverdure.  The scene was such as induced Harley to stand and enjoy it;\nwhen, turning round, his notice was attracted by an object, which the\nfixture of his eye on the spot he walked had before prevented him from\nobserving.\n\nAn old man, who from his dress seemed to have been a soldier, lay fast\nasleep on the ground; a knapsack rested on a stone at his right hand,\nwhile his staff and brass-hilted sword were crossed at his left.\n\nHarley looked on him with the most earnest attention.  He was one of\nthose figures which Salvator would have drawn; nor was the surrounding\nscenery unlike the wildness of that painter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back-grounds.  The banks on\neach side were covered with fantastic shrub-wood, and at a little\ndistance, on the top of one of them, stood a finger-post, to mark the\ndirections of two roads which diverged from the point where it was\nplaced.  A rock, with some dangling wild flowers, jutted out above where\nthe soldier lay; on which grew the stump of a large tree, white with age,\nand a single twisted branch shaded his face as he slept.  His face had\nthe marks of manly comeliness impaired by time; his forehead was not\naltogether bald, but its hairs might have been numbered; while a few\nwhite locks behind crossed the brown of his neck with a contrast the most\nvenerable to a mind like Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art old,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut age has not brought thee rest for its infirmities; I fear those\nsilver hairs have not found shelter from thy country, though that neck\nhas been bronzed in its service.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The stranger waked.  He looked at\nHarley with the appearance of some confusion: it was a pain the latter\nknew too well to think of causing in another; he turned and went on.  The\nold man re-adjusted his knapsack, and followed in one of the tracks on\nthe opposite side of the road.\n\nWhen Harley heard the tread of his feet behind him, he could not help\nstealing back a glance at his fellow-traveller.  He seemed to bend under\nthe weight of his knapsack; he halted on his walk, and one of his arms\nwas supported by a sling, and lay motionless across his breast.  He had\nthat steady look of sorrow, which indicates that its owner has gazed upon\nhis griefs till he has forgotten to lament them; yet not without those\nstreaks of complacency which a good mind will sometimes throw into the\ncountenance, through all the incumbent load of its depression.\n\nHe had now advanced nearer to Harley, and, with an uncertain sort of\nvoice, begged to know what it was o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009csleep has\nbeguiled me of my time, and I shall hardly have light enough left to\ncarry me to the end of my journey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFather!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley (who by this time found the romantic enthusiasm\nrising within him) \u00e2\u0080\u009chow far do you mean to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut a little way, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand indeed it is but a\nlittle way I can manage now: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis just four miles from the height to the\nvillage, thither I am going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going there too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe may make the road shorter to\neach other.  You seem to have served your country, sir, to have served it\nhardly too; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a character I have the highest esteem for.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would not\nbe impertinently inquisitive; but there is that in your appearance which\nexcites my curiosity to know something more of you; in the meantime,\nsuffer me to carry that knapsack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man gazed on him; a tear stood in his eye!  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are too good; may Heaven bless you for an old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\nwho has nothing but his blessing to give! but my knapsack is so familiar\nto my shoulders, that I should walk the worse for wanting it; and it\nwould be troublesome to you, who have not been used to its weight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFar from it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should tread the lighter; it would be\nthe most honourable badge I ever wore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger, who had looked earnestly in Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face\nduring the last part of his discourse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis act your name Harley?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am ashamed to say I have forgotten yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may well have forgotten my face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the stranger;\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a long\ntime since you saw it; but possibly you may remember something of old\nEdwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEdwards!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009coh! heavens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and sprung to embrace him; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\nme clasp those knees on which I have sat so often: Edwards!\u00e2\u0080\u0094I shall never\nforget that fire-side, round which I have been so happy!  But where,\nwhere have you been? where is Jack? where is your daughter?  How has it\nfared with them, when fortune, I fear, has been so unkind to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a long tale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Edwards; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I will try to tell it you as we\nwalk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you were at school in the neighbourhood, you remember me at\nSouth-hill: that farm had been possessed by my father, grandfather, and\ngreat-grandfather, which last was a younger brother of that very man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nancestor, who is now lord of the manor.  I thought I managed it, as they\nhad done, with prudence; I paid my rent regularly as it became due, and\nhad always as much behind as gave bread to me and my children.  But my\nlast lease was out soon after you left that part of the country; and the\nsquire, who had lately got a London-attorney for his steward, would not\nrenew it, because, he said, he did not chuse to have any farm under \u00c2\u00a3300\na year value on his estate; but offered to give me the preference on the\nsame terms with another, if I chose to take the one he had marked out, of\nwhich mine was a part.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat could I do, Mr. Harley?  I feared the undertaking was too great for\nme; yet to leave, at my age, the house I had lived in from my cradle!  I\ncould not, Mr. Harley, I could not; there was not a tree about it that I\ndid not look on as my father, my brother, or my child: so I even ran the\nrisk, and took the squire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offer of the whole.  But had soon reason to\nrepent of my bargain; the steward had taken care that my former farm\nshould be the best land of the division: I was obliged to hire more\nservants, and I could not have my eye over them all; some unfavourable\nseasons followed one another, and I found my affairs entangling on my\nhands.  To add to my distress, a considerable corn-factor turned bankrupt\nwith a sum of mine in his possession: I failed paying my rent so\npunctually as I was wont to do, and the same steward had my stock taken\nin execution in a few days after.  So, Mr. Harley, there was an end of my\nprosperity.  However, there was as much produced from the sale of my\neffects as paid my debts and saved me from a jail: I thank God I wronged\nno man, and the world could never charge me with dishonesty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad you seen us, Mr. Harley, when we were turned out of South-hill, I am\nsure you would have wept at the sight.  You remember old Trusty, my shag\nhouse-dog; I shall never forget it while I live; the poor creature was\nblind with age, and could scarce crawl after us to the door; he went\nhowever as far as the gooseberry-bush that you may remember stood on the\nleft side of the yard; he was wont to bask in the sun there; when he had\nreached that spot, he stopped; we went on: I called to him; he wagged his\ntail, but did not stir: I called again; he lay down: I whistled, and\ncried Trusty; he gave a short howl, and died!  I could have lain down and\ndied too; but God gave me strength to live for my children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man now paused a moment to take breath.  He eyed Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face;\nit was bathed with tears: the story was grown familiar to himself; he\ndropped one tear, and no more.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough I was poor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not altogether without credit.\nA gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had a small farm unoccupied at the\ntime, offered to let me have it, on giving security for the rent; which I\nmade shift to procure.  It was a piece of ground which required\nmanagement to make anything of; but it was nearly within the compass of\nmy son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s labour and my own.  We exerted all our industry to bring it into\nsome heart.  We began to succeed tolerably and lived contented on its\nproduce, when an unlucky accident brought us under the displeasure of a\nneighbouring justice of the peace, and broke all our family-happiness\nagain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy son was a remarkable good shooter; he-had always kept a pointer on\nour former farm, and thought no harm in doing so now; when one day,\nhaving sprung a covey in our own ground, the dog, of his own accord,\nfollowed them into the justice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  My son laid down his gun, and went\nafter his dog to bring him back: the game-keeper, who had marked the\nbirds, came up, and seeing the pointer, shot him just as my son\napproached.  The creature fell; my son ran up to him: he died with a\ncomplaining sort of cry at his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet.  Jack could bear it no\nlonger; but, flying at the game-keeper, wrenched his gun out of his hand,\nand with the butt end of it, felled him to the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had scarce got home, when a constable came with a warrant, and\ndragged him to prison; there he lay, for the justices would not take\nbail, till he was tried at the quarter-sessions for the assault and\nbattery.  His fine was hard upon us to pay: we contrived however to live\nthe worse for it, and make up the loss by our frugality: but the justice\nwas not content with that punishment, and soon after had an opportunity\nof punishing us indeed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn officer with press-orders came down to our county, and having met\nwith the justices, agreed that they should pitch on a certain number, who\ncould most easily be spared from the county, of whom he would take care\nto clear it: my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was in the justices\u00e2\u0080\u0099 list.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas on a Christmas eve, and the birth-day too of my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little boy.\nThe night was piercing cold, and it blew a storm, with showers of hail\nand snow.  We had made up a cheering fire in an inner room; I sat before\nit in my wicker-chair; blessing providence, that had still left a shelter\nfor me and my children.  My son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two little ones were holding their\ngambols around us; my heart warmed at the sight: I brought a bottle of my\nbest ale, and all our misfortunes were forgotten.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt had long been our custom to play a game at blind man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s buff on that\nnight, and it was not omitted now; so to it we fell, I, and my son, and\nhis wife, the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, who happened to be with\nus at the time, the two children, and an old maid servant, who had lived\nwith me from a child.  The lot fell on my son to be blindfolded: we had\ncontinued some time in our game, when he groped his way into an outer\nroom in pursuit of some of us, who, he imagined, had taken shelter there;\nwe kept snug in our places, and enjoyed his mistake.  He had not been\nlong there, when he was suddenly seized from behind; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall have you\nnow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, and turned about.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall you so, master?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered the\nruffian, who had laid hold of him; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we shall make you play at another\nsort of game by and by.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094At these words Harley started with a convulsive\nsort of motion, and grasping Edwards\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sword, drew it half out of the\nscabbard, with a look of the most frantic wildness.  Edwards gently\nreplaced it in its sheath, and went on with his relation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn hearing these words in a strange voice, we all rushed out to discover\nthe cause; the room by this time was almost full of the gang.  My\ndaughter-in-law fainted at the sight; the maid and I ran to assist her,\nwhile my poor son remained motionless, gazing by turns on his children\nand their mother.  We soon recovered her to life, and begged her to\nretire and wait the issue of the affair; but she flew to her husband, and\nclung round him in an agony of terror and grief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the gang was one of a smoother aspect, whom, by his dress, we\ndiscovered to be a serjeant of foot: he came up to me, and told me, that\nmy son had his choice of the sea or land service, whispering at the same\ntime that, if he chose the land, he might get off, on procuring him\nanother man, and paying a certain sum for his freedom.  The money we\ncould just muster up in the house, by the assistance of the maid, who\nproduced, in a green bag, all the little savings of her service; but the\nman we could not expect to find.  My daughter-in-law gazed upon her\nchildren with a look of the wildest despair: \u00e2\u0080\u0098My poor infants!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098your father is forced from you; who shall now labour for your bread? or\nmust your mother beg for herself and you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099  I prayed her to be patient;\nbut comfort I had none to give her.  At last, calling the serjeant aside,\nI asked him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098If I was too old to be accepted in place of my son?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are rather old to be sure, but yet\nthe money may do much.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI put the money in his hand, and coming back to my children, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jack,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are free; live to give your wife and these little ones\nbread; I will go, my child, in your stead; I have but little life to\nlose, and if I staid, I should add one to the wretches you left behind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied my son, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not that coward you imagine me; heaven\nforbid that my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grey hairs should be so exposed, while I sat idle\nat home; I am young and able to endure much, and God will take care of\nyou and my family.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jack,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will put an end to this matter, you have never\nhitherto disobeyed me; I will not be contradicted in this; stay at home,\nI charge you, and, for my sake, be kind to my children.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur parting, Mr. Harley, I cannot describe to you; it was the first time\nwe ever had parted: the very press-gang could scarce keep from tears; but\nthe serjeant, who had seemed the softest before, was now the least moved\nof them all.  He conducted me to a party of new-raised recruits, who lay\nat a village in the neighbourhood; and we soon after joined the regiment.\nI had not been long with it when we were ordered to the East Indies,\nwhere I was soon made a serjeant, and might have picked up some money, if\nmy heart had been as hard as some others were; but my nature was never of\nthat kind, that could think of getting rich at the expense of my\nconscience.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmongst our prisoners was an old Indian, whom some of our officers\nsupposed to have a treasure hidden somewhere; which is no uncommon\npractice in that country.  They pressed him to discover it.  He declared\nhe had none, but that would not satisfy them, so they ordered him to be\ntied to a stake, and suffer fifty lashes every morning till he should\nlearn to speak out, as they said.  Oh! Mr. Harley, had you seen him, as I\ndid, with his hands bound behind him, suffering in silence, while the big\ndrops trickled down his shrivelled cheeks and wet his grey beard, which\nsome of the inhuman soldiers plucked in scorn!  I could not bear it, I\ncould not for my soul, and one morning, when the rest of the guard were\nout of the way, I found means to let him escape.  I was tried by a\ncourt-martial for negligence of my post, and ordered, in compassion of my\nage, and having got this wound in my arm and that in my leg in the\nservice, only to suffer three hundred lashes and be turned out of the\nregiment; but my sentence was mitigated as to the lashes, and I had only\ntwo hundred.  When I had suffered these I was turned out of the camp, and\nhad betwixt three and four hundred miles to travel before I could reach a\nsea-port, without guide to conduct me, or money to buy me provisions by\nthe way.  I set out, however, resolved to walk as far as I could, and\nthen to lay myself down and die.  But I had scarce gone a mile when I was\nmet by the Indian whom I had delivered.  He pressed me in his arms, and\nkissed the marks of the lashes on my back a thousand times; he led me to\na little hut, where some friend of his dwelt, and after I was recovered\nof my wounds conducted me so far on my journey himself, and sent another\nIndian to guide me through the rest.  When we parted he pulled out a\npurse with two hundred pieces of gold in it.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Take this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098my\ndear preserver, it is all I have been able to procure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI begged him not to bring himself to poverty for my sake, who should\nprobably have no need of it long, but he insisted on my accepting it.  He\nembraced me.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are an Englishman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but the Great Spirit has\ngiven you an Indian heart, may He bear up the weight of your old age, and\nblunt the arrow that brings it rest!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe parted, and not long after I made shift to get my passage to England.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis but about a week since I landed, and I am going to end my days in\nthe arms of my son.  This sum may be of use to him and his children, \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis\nall the value I put upon it.  I thank Heaven I never was covetous of\nwealth; I never had much, but was always so happy as to be content with\nmy little.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Edwards had ended his relation, Harley stood a while looking at him\nin silence; at last he pressed him in his arms, and when he had given\nvent to the fulness of his heart by a shower of tears, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEdwards,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet me hold thee to my bosom, let me imprint the virtue of thy\nsufferings on my soul.  Come, my honoured veteran! let me endeavour to\nsoften the last days of a life, worn out in the service of humanity; call\nme also thy son, and let me cherish thee as a father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEdwards, from whom the recollection of his own suffering had scarced\nforced a tear, now blubbered like a boy; he could not speak his\ngratitude, but by some short exclamations of blessings upon Harley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\nHE MISSES AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.\u00e2\u0080\u0094AN ADVENTURE CONSEQUENT UPON IT.\n\n\nWHEN they had arrived within a little way of the village they journeyed\nto, Harley stopped short, and looked steadfastly on the mouldering walls\nof a ruined house that stood on the road side.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, heavens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do I see: silent, unroofed, and desolate!  Are all thy gay tenants\ngone? do I hear their hum no more Edwards, look there, look there? the\nscene of my infant joys, my earliest friendships, laid waste and ruinous!\nThat was the very school where I was boarded when you were at South-hill;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099tis but a twelve-month since I saw it standing, and its benches filled\nwith cherubs: that opposite side of the road was the green on which they\nsported; see it now ploughed up!  I would have given fifty times its\nvalue to have saved it from the sacrilege of that plough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Edwards, \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps they have left it from choice, and\nmay have got another spot as good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey cannot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey cannot; I shall never see the sward\ncovered with its daisies, nor pressed by the dance of the dear innocents:\nI shall never see that stump decked with the garlands which their little\nhands had gathered.  These two long stones, which now lie at the foot of\nit, were once the supports of a hut I myself assisted to rear: I have sat\non the sods within it, when we had spread our banquet of apples before\nus, and been more blessed\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh!  Edwards, infinitely more blessed, than\never I shall be again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJust then a woman passed them on the road, and discovered some signs of\nwonder at the attitude of Harley, who stood, with his hands folded\ntogether, looking with a moistened eye on the fallen pillars of the hut.\nHe was too much entranced in thought to observe her at all, but Edwards,\ncivilly accosting her, desired to know if that had not been the\nschool-house, and how it came into the condition in which they now saw\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlack a day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was the school-house indeed; but to be sure,\nsir, the squire has pulled it down because it stood in the way of his\nprospects.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! how! prospects! pulled down!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, to be sure, sir; and the green, where the children used to play, he\nhas ploughed up, because, he said, they hurt his fence on the other side\nof it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCurses on his narrow heart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat could violate a right\nso sacred!  Heaven blast the wretch!\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd from his derogate body never spring\n    A babe to honour him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut I need not, Edwards, I need not\u00e2\u0080\u009d (recovering himself a little), \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nis cursed enough already: to him the noblest source of happiness is\ndenied, and the cares of his sordid soul shall gnaw it, while thou\nsittest over a brown crust, smiling on those mangled limbs that have\nsaved thy son and his children!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you want anything with the school-mistress, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ncan show you the way to her house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe followed her without knowing whither he went.\n\nThey stopped at the door of a snug habitation, where sat an elderly woman\nwith a boy and a girl before her, each of whom held a supper of bread and\nmilk in their hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, sir, is the school-mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas not an old venerable man school-master here\nsome time ago?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, he was, poor man; the loss of his former school-house, I\nbelieve, broke his heart, for he died soon after it was taken down, and\nas another has not yet been found, I have that charge in the meantime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd this boy and girl, I presume, are your pupils?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAy, sir; they are poor orphans, put under my care by the parish, and\nmore promising children I never saw.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOrphans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, of honest creditable parents as any in the parish, and it is a\nshame for some folks to forget their relations at a time when they have\nmost need to remember them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us never forget that we are all relations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe kissed the children.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir father, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas a farmer here in the\nneighbourhood, and a sober industrious man he was; but nobody can help\nmisfortunes: what with bad crops, and bad debts, which are worse, his\naffairs went to wreck, and both he and his wife died of broken hearts.\nAnd a sweet couple they were, sir; there was not a properer man to look\non in the county than John Edwards, and so indeed were all the\nEdwardses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Edwardses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the old soldier hastily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Edwardses of South-hill, and a worthy family they were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSouth-hill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, in a languid voice, and fell back into the arms of\nthe astonished Harley.  The school-mistress ran for some water\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a\nsmelling-bottle, with the assistance of which they soon recovered the\nunfortunate Edwards.  He stared wildly for some time, then folding his\norphan grandchildren in his arms,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! my children, my children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave I found you thus?  My\npoor Jack, art thou gone?  I thought thou shouldst have carried thy\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grey hairs to the grave! and these little ones\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094his tears choked\nhis utterance, and he fell again on the necks of the children.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cProvidence has sent you to relieve them;\nit will bless me if I can be the means of assisting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfather, when he was a-dying, bade\nGod bless us, and prayed that if grandfather lived he might send him to\nsupport us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did they lay my boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Edwards.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the Old Churchyard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009chard by his mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will show it you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the boy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I have wept over it many a\ntime when first I came amongst strange folks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, Harley laid hold of his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and they\nwalked in silence to the churchyard.\n\nThere was an old stone, with the corner broken off, and some letters,\nhalf-covered with moss, to denote the names of the dead: there was a\ncyphered R. E. plainer than the rest; it was the tomb they sought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere it is, grandfather,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the boy.\n\nEdwards gazed upon it without uttering a word: the girl, who had only\nsighed before, now wept outright; her brother sobbed, but he stifled his\nsobbing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she should not take it so to heart;\nshe can knit already, and I shall soon be able to dig, we shall not\nstarve, sister, indeed we shall not, nor shall grandfather neither.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe girl cried afresh; Harley kissed off her tears as they flowed, and\nwept between every kiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\nHE RETURNS HOME.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A DESCRIPTION OF HIS RETINUE.\n\n\nIT was with some difficulty that Harley prevailed on the old man to leave\nthe spot where the remains of his son were laid.  At last, with the\nassistance of the school-mistress, he prevailed; and she accommodated\nEdwards and him with beds in her house, there being nothing like an inn\nnearer than the distance of some miles.\n\nIn the morning Harley persuaded Edwards to come with the children to his\nhouse, which was distant but a short day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey.  The boy walked in\nhis grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand; and the name of Edwards procured him a\nneighbouring farmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horse, on which a servant mounted, with the girl on\na pillow before him.\n\nWith this train Harley returned to the abode of his fathers: and we\ncannot but think, that his enjoyment was as great as if he had arrived\nfrom the tour of Europe with a Swiss valet for his companion, and half a\ndozen snuff-boxes, with invisible hinges, in his pocket.  But we take our\nideas from sounds which folly has invented; Fashion, Bon ton, and Vert\u00c3\u00b9,\nare the names of certain idols, to which we sacrifice the genuine\npleasures of the soul: in this world of semblance, we are contented with\npersonating happiness; to feel it is an art beyond us.\n\nIt was otherwise with Harley; he ran upstairs to his aunt with the\nhistory of his fellow-travellers glowing on his lips.  His aunt was an\neconomist; but she knew the pleasure of doing charitable things, and\nwithal was fond of her nephew, and solicitous to oblige him.  She\nreceived old Edwards therefore with a look of more complacency than is\nperhaps natural to maiden ladies of three-score, and was remarkably\nattentive to his grandchildren: she roasted apples with her own hands for\ntheir supper, and made up a little bed beside her own for the girl.\nEdwards made some attempts towards an acknowledgment for these favours;\nbut his young friend stopped them in their beginnings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhosoever receiveth any of these children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his aunt; for her\nacquaintance with her Bible was habitual.\n\nEarly next morning Harley stole into the room where Edwards lay: he\nexpected to have found him a-bed, but in this he was mistaken: the old\nman had risen, and was leaning over his sleeping grandson, with the tears\nflowing down his cheeks.  At first he did not perceive Harley; when he\ndid, he endeavoured to hide his grief, and crossing his eyes with his\nhand expressed his surprise at seeing him so early astir.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was thinking of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand your children: I learned last\nnight that a small farm of mine in the neighbourhood is now vacant: if\nyou will occupy it I shall gain a good neighbour and be able in some\nmeasure to repay the notice you took of me when a boy, and as the\nfurniture of the house is mine, it will be so much trouble saved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEdwards\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tears gushed afresh, and Harley led him to see the place he\nintended for him.\n\nThe house upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut; its\nsituation, however, was pleasant, and Edwards, assisted by the\nbeneficence of Harley, set about improving its neatness and convenience.\nHe staked out a piece of the green before for a garden, and Peter, who\nacted in Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family as valet, butler, and gardener, had orders to\nfurnish him with parcels of the different seeds he chose to sow in it.  I\nhave seen his master at work in this little spot with his coat off, and\nhis dibble in his hand: it was a scene of tranquil virtue to have stopped\nan angel on his errands of mercy!  Harley had contrived to lead a little\nbubbling brook through a green walk in the middle of the ground, upon\nwhich he had erected a mill in miniature for the diversion of Edwards\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninfant grandson, and made shift in its construction to introduce a pliant\nbit of wood that answered with its fairy clack to the murmuring of the\nrill that turned it.  I have seen him stand, listening to these mingled\nsounds, with his eye fixed on the boy, and the smile of conscious\nsatisfaction on his cheek, while the old man, with a look half turned to\nHarley and half to heaven, breathed an ejaculation of gratitude and\npiety.\n\nFather of mercies!  I also would thank thee that not only hast thou\nassigned eternal rewards to virtue, but that, even in this bad world, the\nlines of our duty and our happiness are so frequently woven together.\n\n\n\nA FRAGMENT.\nTHE MAN OF FEELING TALKS OF WHAT HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND.\u00e2\u0080\u0094AN INCIDENT.\n\n\n* * * * \u00e2\u0080\u009cEDWARDS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a proper regard for the prosperity of\nmy country: every native of it appropriates to himself some share of the\npower, or the fame, which, as a nation, it acquires, but I cannot throw\noff the man so much as to rejoice at our conquests in India.  You tell me\nof immense territories subject to the English: I cannot think of their\npossessions without being led to inquire by what right they possess them.\nThey came there as traders, bartering the commodities they brought for\nothers which their purchasers could spare; and however great their\nprofits were, they were then equitable.  But what title have the subjects\nof another kingdom to establish an empire in India? to give laws to a\ncountry where the inhabitants received them on the terms of friendly\ncommerce?  You say they are happier under our regulations than the\ntyranny of their own petty princes.  I must doubt it, from the conduct of\nthose by whom these regulations have been made.  They have drained the\ntreasuries of Nabobs, who must fill them by oppressing the industry of\ntheir subjects.  Nor is this to be wondered at, when we consider the\nmotive upon which those gentlemen do not deny their going to India.  The\nfame of conquest, barbarous as that motive is, is but a secondary\nconsideration: there are certain stations in wealth to which the warriors\nof the East aspire.  It is there, indeed, where the wishes of their\nfriends assign them eminence, where the question of their country is\npointed at their return.  When shall I see a commander return from India\nin the pride of honourable poverty?  You describe the victories they have\ngained; they are sullied by the cause in which they fought: you enumerate\nthe spoils of those victories; they are covered with the blood of the\nvanquished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you tell me of some conqueror giving peace and happiness to the\nconquered? did he accept the gifts of their princes to use them for the\ncomfort of those whose fathers, sons, or husbands, fell in battle? did he\nuse his power to gain security and freedom to the regions of oppression\nand slavery? did he endear the British name by examples of generosity,\nwhich the most barbarous or most depraved are rarely able to resist? did\nhe return with the consciousness of duty discharged to his country, and\nhumanity to his fellow-creatures? did he return with no lace on his coat,\nno slaves in his retinue, no chariot at his door, and no burgundy at his\ntable?\u00e2\u0080\u0094these were laurels which princes might envy\u00e2\u0080\u0094which an honest man\nwould not condemn!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour maxims, Mr. Harley, are certainly right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Edwards.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not\ncapable of arguing with you; but I imagine there are great temptations in\na great degree of riches, which it is no easy matter to resist: those a\npoor man like me cannot describe, because he never knew them; and perhaps\nI have reason to bless God that I never did; for then, it is likely, I\nshould have withstood them no better than my neighbours.  For you know,\nsir, that it is not the fashion now, as it was in former times, that I\nhave read of in books, when your great generals died so poor, that they\ndid not leave wherewithal to buy them a coffin; and people thought the\nbetter of their memories for it: if they did so now-a-days, I question if\nany body, except yourself, and some few like you, would thank them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat there is so much truth in what you\nsay; but however the general current of opinion may point, the feelings\nare not yet lost that applaud benevolence, and censure inhumanity.  Let\nus endeavour to strengthen them in ourselves; and we, who live\nsequestered from the noise of the multitude, have better opportunities of\nlistening undisturbed to their voice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey now approached the little dwelling of Edwards.  A maid-servant, whom\nhe had hired to assist him in the care of his grandchildren met them a\nlittle way from the house: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a young lady within with the\nchildren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.  Edwards expressed his surprise at the visit: it was\nhowever not the less true; and we mean to account for it.\n\nThis young lady then was no other than Miss Walton.  She had heard the\nold man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history from Harley, as we have already related it.  Curiosity,\nor some other motive, made her desirous to see his grandchildren; this\nshe had an opportunity of gratifying soon, the children, in some of their\nwalks, having strolled as far as her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s avenue.  She put several\nquestions to both; she was delighted with the simplicity of their\nanswers, and promised, that if they continued to be good children, and do\nas their grandfather bid them, she would soon see them again, and bring\nsome present or other for their reward.  This promise she had performed\nnow: she came attended only by her maid, and brought with her a complete\nsuit of green for the boy, and a chintz gown, a cap, and a suit of\nribbons, for his sister.  She had time enough, with her maid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nassistance, to equip them in their new habiliments before Harley and\nEdwards returned.  The boy heard his grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, and, with that\nsilent joy which his present finery inspired, ran to the door to meet\nhim: putting one hand in his, with the other pointed to his sister,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat Miss Walton has brought us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Edwards gazed on them.\nHarley fixed his eyes on Miss Walton; her\u00e2\u0080\u0099s were turned to the ground;\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\nEdwards\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was a beamy moisture.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He folded his hands together\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot\nspeak, young lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Neither could Harley.\nThere were a thousand sentiments; but they gushed so impetuously on his\nheart, that he could not utter a syllable. * * * *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\nTHE MAN OF FEELING JEALOUS.\n\n\nTHE desire of communicating knowledge or intelligence, is an argument\nwith those who hold that man is naturally a social animal.  It is indeed\none of the earliest propensities we discover; but it may be doubted\nwhether the pleasure (for pleasure there certainly is) arising from it be\nnot often more selfish than social: for we frequently observe the tidings\nof Ill communicated as eagerly as the annunciation of Good.  Is it that\nwe delight in observing the effects of the stronger passions? for we are\nall philosophers in this respect; and it is perhaps amongst the\nspectators at Tyburn that the most genuine are to be found.\n\nWas it from this motive that Peter came one morning into his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nroom with a meaning face of recital?  His master indeed did not at first\nobserve it; for he was sitting with one shoe buckled, delineating\nportraits in the fire.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have brushed those clothes, sir, as you\nordered me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harley nodded his head but Peter observed that his hat\nwanted brushing too: his master nodded again.  At last Peter bethought\nhim that the fire needed stirring; and taking up the poker, demolished\nthe turban\u00e2\u0080\u0099d head of a Saracen, while his master was seeking out a body\nfor it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe morning is main cold, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Peter.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nHarley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir; I have been as far as Tom Dowson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to fetch some\nbarberries he had picked for Mrs. Margery.  There was a rare junketting\nlast night at Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s among Sir Harry Benson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servants; he lay at\nSquire Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but he would not suffer his servants to trouble the\nfamily: so, to be sure, they were all at Tom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and had a fiddle, and a\nhot supper in the big room where the justices meet about the destroying\nof hares and partridges, and them things; and Tom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes looked so red\nand so bleared when I called him to get the barberries:\u00e2\u0080\u0094And I hear as how\nSir Harry is going to be married to Miss Walton.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow!  Miss Walton\nmarried!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be true, sir, for all that; but\nTom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife told it me, and to be sure the servants told her, and their\nmaster told them, as I guess, sir; but it mayn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be true for all that, as\nI said before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave done with your idle information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs\nmy aunt come down into the parlour to breakfast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell her\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be with her immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Peter was gone, he stood with his eyes fixed on the ground, and the\nlast words of his intelligence vibrating in his ears.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Walton\nmarried!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sighed\u00e2\u0080\u0094and walked down stairs, with his shoe as it was, and\nthe buckle in his hand.  His aunt, however, was pretty well accustomed to\nthose appearances of absence; besides, that the natural gravity of her\ntemper, which was commonly called into exertion by the care of her\nhousehold concerns, was such as not easily to be discomposed by any\ncircumstance of accidental impropriety.  She too had been informed of the\nintended match between Sir Harry Benson and Miss Walton.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have been\nthinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they are distant relations: for the\ngreat-grandfather of this Sir Harry Benson, who was knight of the shire\nin the reign of Charles the First, and one of the cavaliers of those\ntimes, was married to a daughter of the Walton family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley answered\ndrily, that it might be so; but that he never troubled himself about\nthose matters.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are to blame, nephew, for not\nknowing a little more of them: before I was near your age I had sewed the\npedigree of our family in a set of chair-bottoms, that were made a\npresent of to my grandmother, who was a very notable woman, and had a\nproper regard for gentility, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll assure you; but now-a-days it is money,\nnot birth, that makes people respected; the more shame for the times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarley was in no very good humour for entering into a discussion of this\nquestion; but he always entertained so much filial respect for his aunt,\nas to attend to her discourse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe blame the pride of the rich,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut are not we ashamed of our\npoverty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, one would not choose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his aunt, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto make a much worse\nfigure than one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighbours; but, as I was saying before, the times (as\nmy friend, Mrs. Dorothy Walton, observes) are shamefully degenerated in\nthis respect.  There was but t\u00e2\u0080\u0099other day at Mr. Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, that fat\nfellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, the London merchant, as he calls himself, though I\nhave heard that he was little better than the keeper of a chandler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshop.  We were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea.  She had a hoop,\nforsooth, as large and as stiff\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it showed a pair of bandy legs, as\nthick as two\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was nearer the door by an apron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s length, and the pert\nhussy brushed by me, as who should say, Make way for your betters, and\nwith one of her London bobs\u00e2\u0080\u0094but Mrs. Dorothy did not let her pass with\nit; for all the time of drinking tea, she spoke of the precedency of\nfamily, and the disparity there is between people who are come of\nsomething and your mushroom gentry who wear their coats of arms in their\npurses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid with a damask\ntable-cloth, and a set of napkins, from the loom, which had been spun by\nher mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own hand.  There was the family crest in each corner, and\nin the middle a view of the battle of Worcester, where one of her\nancestors had been a captain in the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forces; and with a sort of\npoetical licence in perspective, there was seen the Royal Oak, with more\nwig than leaves upon it.\n\nOn all this the good lady was very copious, and took up the remaining\nintervals of filling tea, to describe its excellencies to Harley; adding,\nthat she intended this as a present for his wife, when he should get one.\nHe sighed and looked foolish, and commending the serenity of the day,\nwalked out into the garden.\n\nHe sat down on a little seat which commanded an extensive prospect round\nthe house.  He leaned on his hand, and scored the ground with his stick:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Walton married!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut what is that to me?  May she be\nhappy! her virtues deserve it; to me her marriage is otherwise\nindifferent: I had romantic dreams? they are fled?\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is perfectly\nindifferent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJust at that moment he saw a servant with a knot of ribbons in his hat go\ninto the house.  His cheeks grew flushed at the sight!  He kept his eye\nfixed for some time on the door by which he had entered, then starting to\nhis feet, hastily followed him.\n\nWhen he approached the door of the kitchen where he supposed the man had\nentered, his heart throbbed so violently, that when he would have called\nPeter, his voice failed in the attempt.  He stood a moment listening in\nthis breathless state of palpitation: Peter came out by chance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid\nyour honour want any thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the servant that came just now\nfrom Mr. Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom Mr. Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, sir! there is none of his\nservants here that I know of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNor of Sir Harry Benson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He did not\nwait for an answer; but having by this time observed the hat with its\nparti-coloured ornament hanging on a peg near the door, he pressed\nforwards into the kitchen, and addressing himself to a stranger whom he\nsaw there, asked him, with no small tremor in his voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he had any\ncommands for him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The man looked silly, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat he had nothing\nto trouble his honour with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre not you a servant of Sir Harry\nBenson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pardon me, young man; I judged by the\nfavour in your hat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m his majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant, God bless him! and\nthese favours we always wear when we are recruiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cRecruiting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d his\neyes glistened at the word: he seized the soldier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, and shaking it\nviolently, ordered Peter to fetch a bottle of his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best dram.  The\nbottle was brought: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall drink the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin\na bumper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe king and your honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNay, you shall drink the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhealth by itself; you may drink mine in another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Peter looked in his\nmaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and filled with some little reluctance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow to your\nmistress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley; \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery soldier has a mistress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The man excused\nhimself\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo your mistress! you cannot refuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas Mrs. Margery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbest dram!  Peter stood with the bottle a little inclined, but not so as\nto discharge a drop of its contents: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFill it, Peter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his master,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cfill it to the brim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Peter filled it; and the soldier having named\nSuky Simpson, dispatched it in a twinkling.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThou art an honest fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I love thee;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and shaking his hand again, desired Peter\nto make him his guest at dinner, and walked up into his room with a pace\nmuch quicker and more springy than usual.\n\nThis agreeable disappointment, however, he was not long suffered to\nenjoy.  The curate happened that day to dine with him: his visits,\nindeed, were more properly to the aunt than the nephew; and many of the\nintelligent ladies in the parish, who, like some very great philosophers,\nhave the happy knack at accounting for everything, gave out that there\nwas a particular attachment between them, which wanted only to be matured\nby some more years of courtship to end in the tenderest connection.  In\nthis conclusion, indeed, supposing the premises to have been true, they\nwere somewhat justified by the known opinion of the lady, who frequently\ndeclared herself a friend to the ceremonial of former times, when a lover\nmight have sighed seven years at his mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet before he was\nallowed the liberty of kissing her hand.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis true Mrs. Margery was now\nabout her grand climacteric; no matter: that is just the age when we\nexpect to grow younger.  But I verily believe there was nothing in the\nreport; the curate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connection was only that of a genealogist; for in\nthat character he was no way inferior to Mrs. Margery herself.  He dealt\nalso in the present times; for he was a politician and a news-monger.\n\nHe had hardly said grace after dinner, when he told Mrs. Margery that she\nmight soon expect a pair of white gloves, as Sir Harry Benson, he was\nvery well informed, was just going to be married to Miss Walton.  Harley\nspilt the wine he was carrying to his mouth: he had time, however, to\nrecollect himself before the curate had finished the different\nparticulars of his intelligence, and summing up all the heroism he was\nmaster of, filled a bumper, and drank to Miss Walton.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith all my\nheart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the curate, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bride that is to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harley would have\nsaid bride too; but the word bride stuck in his throat.  His confusion,\nindeed, was manifest; but the curate began to enter on some point of\ndescent with Mrs. Margery, and Harley had very soon after an opportunity\nof leaving them, while they were deeply engaged in a question, whether\nthe name of some great man in the time of Henry the Seventh was Richard\nor Humphrey.\n\nHe did not see his aunt again till supper; the time between he spent in\nwalking, like some troubled ghost, round the place where his treasure\nlay.  He went as far as a little gate, that led into a copse near Mr.\nWalton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, to which that gentleman had been so obliging as to let\nhim have a key.  He had just begun to open it when he saw, on a terrace\nbelow, Miss Walton walking with a gentleman in a riding-dress, whom he\nimmediately guessed to be Sir Harry Benson.  He stopped of a sudden; his\nhand shook so much that he could hardly turn the key; he opened the gate,\nhowever, and advanced a few paces.  The lady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap-dog pricked up its\nears, and barked; he stopped again\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little dogs and all,\n    Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see they bark at me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis resolution failed; he slunk back, and, locking the gate as softly as\nhe could, stood on tiptoe looking over the wall till they were gone.  At\nthat instant a shepherd blew his horn: the romantic melancholy of the\nsound quite overcame him!\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was the very note that wanted to be\ntouched\u00e2\u0080\u0094he sighed! he dropped a tear!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and returned.\n\nAt supper his aunt observed that he was graver than usual; but she did\nnot suspect the cause: indeed, it may seem odd that she was the only\nperson in the family who had no suspicion of his attachment to Miss\nWalton.  It was frequently matter of discourse amongst the servants:\nperhaps her maiden coldness\u00e2\u0080\u0094but for those things we need not account.\n\nIn a day or two he was so much master of himself as to be able to rhyme\nupon the subject.  The following pastoral he left, some time after, on\nthe handle of a tea-kettle, at a neighbouring house where we were\nvisiting; and as I filled the tea-pot after him, I happened to put it in\nmy pocket by a similar act of forgetfulness.  It is such as might be\nexpected from a man who makes verses for amusement.  I am pleased with\nsomewhat of good nature that runs through it, because I have commonly\nobserved the writers of those complaints to bestow epithets on their lost\nmistresses rather too harsh for the mere liberty of choice, which led\nthem to prefer another to the poet himself: I do not doubt the vehemence\nof their passion; but, alas! the sensations of love are something more\nthan the returns of gratitude.\n\n                                   LAVINIA.\n\n                                 A PASTORAL.\n\n    Why steals from my bosom the sigh?\n       Why fixed is my gaze on the ground?\n    Come, give me my pipe, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try\n       To banish my cares with the sound.\n\n    Erewhile were its notes of accord\n       With the smile of the flow\u00e2\u0080\u0099r-footed Muse;\n    Ah! why by its master implored\n       Shou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d it now the gay carrol refuse?\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0099Twas taught by LAVINIA\u00e2\u0080\u0099S sweet smile,\n       In the mirth-loving chorus to join:\n    Ah, me! how unweeting the while!\n       LAVINIA\u00e2\u0080\u0094can never be mine!\n\n    Another, more happy, the maid\n       By fortune is destin\u00e2\u0080\u0099d to bless\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the hope has forsook that betray\u00e2\u0080\u0099d,\n       Yet why should I love her the less?\n\n    Her beauties are bright as the morn,\n       With rapture I counted them o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er;\n    Such virtues these beauties adorn,\n       I knew her, and prais\u00e2\u0080\u0099d them no more.\n\n    I term\u00e2\u0080\u0099d her no goddess of love,\n       I call\u00e2\u0080\u0099d not her beauty divine:\n    These far other passions may prove,\n       But they could not be figures of mine.\n\n    It ne\u00e2\u0080\u0099er was apparel\u00e2\u0080\u0099d with art,\n       On words it could never rely;\n    It reign\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in the throb of my heart,\n       It gleam\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in the glance of my eye.\n\n    Oh fool! in the circle to shine\n       That Fashion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gay daughters approve,\n    You must speak as the fashions incline;\n       Alas! are there fashions in love?\n\n    Yet sure they are simple who prize\n       The tongue that is smooth to deceive;\n    Yet sure she had sense to despise,\n       The tinsel that folly may weave.\n\n    When I talk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d, I have seen her recline,\n       With an aspect so pensively sweet,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    Tho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I spoke what the shepherds opine,\n       A fop were ashamed to repeat.\n\n    She is soft as the dew-drops that fall\n       From the lip of the sweet-scented pea;\n    Perhaps when she smil\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon all,\n       I have thought that she smil\u00e2\u0080\u0099d upon me.\n\n    But why of her charms should I tell?\n       Ah me! whom her charms have undone\n    Yet I love the reflection too well,\n       The painful reflection to shun.\n\n    Ye souls of more delicate kind,\n       Who feast not on pleasure alone,\n    Who wear the soft sense of the mind,\n       To the sons of the world still unknown.\n\n    Ye know, tho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I cannot express,\n       Why I foolishly doat on my pain;\n    Nor will ye believe it the less,\n       That I have not the skill to complain.\n\n    I lean on my hand with a sigh,\n       My friends the soft sadness condemn;\n    Yet, methinks, tho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I cannot tell why,\n       I should hate to be merry like them.\n\n    When I walk\u00e2\u0080\u0099d in the pride of the dawn,\n       Methought all the region look\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bright:\n    Has sweetness forsaken the lawn?\n       For, methinks, I grow sad at the sight.\n\n    When I stood by the stream, I have thought\n       There was mirth in the gurgling soft sound;\n    But now \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis a sorrowful note,\n       And the banks are all gloomy around!\n\n    I have laugh\u00e2\u0080\u0099d at the jest of a friend;\n       Now they laugh, and I know not the cause,\n    Tho\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I seem with my looks to attend,\n       How silly!

The world\n\n    Will smile, and smile, and be a villain;\n\nand the youth, who does not suspect its deceit, will be content to smile\nwith it.  Men will put on the most forbidding aspect in nature, and tell\nhim of the beauty of virtue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not, under these grey hairs, forgotten that I was once a young\nman, warm in the pursuit of pleasure, but meaning to be honest as well as\nhappy.  I had ideas of virtue, of honour, of benevolence, which I had\nnever been at the pains to define; but I felt my bosom heave at the\nthoughts of them, and I made the most delightful soliloquies.  It is\nimpossible, said I, that there can be half so many rogues as are\nimagined.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI travelled, because it is the fashion for young men of my fortune to\ntravel.  I had a travelling tutor, which is the fashion too; but my tutor\nwas a gentleman, which it is not always the fashion for tutors to be.\nHis gentility, indeed, was all he had from his father, whose prodigality\nhad not left him a shilling to support it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a favour to ask of you, my dear Mountford,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said my father,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098which I will not be refused.  You have travelled as became a man;\nneither France nor Italy have made anything of Mountford, which\nMountford, before he left England, would have been ashamed of.  My son\nEdward goes abroad, would you take him under your protection?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe blushed; my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was scarlet.  He pressed his hand to his\nbosom, as if he had said, my heart does not mean to offend you.\nMountford sighed twice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a proud fool,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and you will pardon it.  There! (he\nsighed again) I can hear of dependance, since it is dependance on my\nSedley.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dependance!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 answered my father; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there can be no such word between us.\nWhat is there in \u00c2\u00a39,000 a year that should make me unworthy of\nMountford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendship?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey embraced; and soon after I set out on my travels, with Mountford\nfor my guardian.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were at Milan, where my father happened to have an Italian friend, to\nwhom he had been of some service in England.  The count, for he was of\nquality, was solicitous to return the obligation by a particular\nattention to his son.  We lived in his palace, visited with his family,\nwere caressed by his friends, and I began to be so well pleased with my\nentertainment, that I thought of England as of some foreign country.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe count had a son not much older than myself.  At that age a friend is\nan easy acquisition; we were friends the first night of our acquaintance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe introduced me into the company of a set of young gentlemen, whose\nfortunes gave them the command of pleasure, and whose inclinations\nincited them to the purchase.  After having spent some joyous evenings in\ntheir society, it became a sort of habit which I could not miss without\nuneasiness, and our meetings, which before were frequent, were now stated\nand regular.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes, in the pauses of our mirth, gaming was introduced as an\namusement.  It was an art in which I was a novice.  I received\ninstruction, as other novices do, by losing pretty largely to my\nteachers.  Nor was this the only evil which Mountford foresaw would arise\nfrom the connection I had formed; but a lecture of sour injunctions was\nnot his method of reclaiming.  He sometimes asked me questions about the\ncompany, but they were such as the curiosity of any indifferent man might\nhave prompted.  I told him of their wit, their eloquence, their warmth of\nfriendship, and their sensibility of heart.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098And their honour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I,\nlaying my hand on my breast, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is unquestionable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Mountford seemed to\nrejoice at my good fortune, and begged that I would introduce him to\ntheir acquaintance.  At the next meeting I introduced him accordingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe conversation was as animated as usual.  They displayed all that\nsprightliness and good-humour which my praises had led Mountford to\nexpect; subjects, too, of sentiment occurred, and their speeches,\nparticularly those of our friend the son of Count Respino, glowed with\nthe warmth of honour, and softened into the tenderness of feeling.\nMountford was charmed with his companions.  When we parted, he made the\nhighest eulogiums upon them.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098When shall we see them again?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he.  I\nwas delighted with the demand, and promised to reconduct him on the\nmorrow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn going to their place of rendezvous, he took me a little out of the\nroad, to see, as he told me, the performances of a young statuary.  When\nwe were near the house in which Mountford said he lived, a boy of about\nseven years old crossed us in the street.  At sight of Mountford he\nstopped, and grasping his hand,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dearest sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098my father is likely to do well.  He will\nlive to pray for you, and to bless you.  Yes, he will bless you, though\nyou are an Englishman, and some other hard word that the monk talked of\nthis morning, which I have forgot, but it meant that you should not go to\nheaven; but he shall go to heaven, said I, for he has saved my father.\nCome and see him, sir, that we may be happy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear, I am engaged at present with this gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098But he shall come along with you; he is an Englishman, too, I fancy.\nHe shall come and learn how an Englishman may go to heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMountford smiled, and we followed the boy together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter crossing the next street, we arrived at the gate of a prison.  I\nseemed surprised at the sight; our little conductor observed it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you afraid, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was afraid once too, but my father\nand mother are here, and I am never afraid when I am with them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe took my hand, and led me through a dark passage that fronted the\ngate.  When we came to a little door at the end, he tapped.  A boy, still\nyounger than himself, opened it to receive us.  Mountford entered with a\nlook in which was pictured the benign assurance of a superior being.  I\nfollowed in silence and amazement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn something like a bed, lay a man, with a face seemingly emaciated with\nsickness, and a look of patient dejection.  A bundle of dirty shreds\nserved him for a pillow, but he had a better support\u00e2\u0080\u0094the arm of a female\nwho kneeled beside him, beautiful as an angel, but with a fading languor\nin her countenance, the still life of melancholy, that seemed to borrow\nits shade from the object on which she gazed.  There was a tear in her\neye\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sick man kissed it off in its bud, smiling through the dimness of\nhis own\u00e2\u0080\u0094when she saw Mountford, she crawled forward on the ground, and\nclasped his knees.  He raised her from the floor; she threw her arms\nround his neck, and sobbed out a speech of thankfulness, eloquent beyond\nthe power of language.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Compose yourself, my love,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man on the bed; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but he, whose\ngoodness has caused that emotion, will pardon its effects.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098How is this, Mountford?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I; \u00e2\u0080\u0098what do I see?  What must I do?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the stranger, \u00e2\u0080\u0098a wretch, sunk in poverty, starving in\nprison, stretched on a sick bed.  But that is little.  There are his wife\nand children wanting the bread which he has not to give them!  Yet you\ncannot easily imagine the conscious serenity of his mind.  In the gripe\nof affliction, his heart swells with the pride of virtue; it can even\nlook down with pity on the man whose cruelty has wrung it almost to\nbursting.  You are, I fancy, a friend of Mr. Mountford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Come nearer,\nand I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you, for, short as my story is, I can hardly command breath\nenough for a recital.  The son of Count Respino (I started, as if I had\ntrod on a viper) has long had a criminal passion for my wife.  This her\nprudence had concealed from me; but he had lately the boldness to declare\nit to myself.  He promised me affluence in exchange for honour, and\nthreatened misery as its attendant if I kept it.  I treated him with the\ncontempt he deserved; the consequence was, that he hired a couple of\nbravoes (for I am persuaded they acted under his direction), who\nattempted to assassinate me in the street; but I made such a defence as\nobliged them to fly, after having given me two or three stabs, none of\nwhich, however, were mortal.  But his revenge was not thus to be\ndisappointed.  In the little dealings of my trade I had contracted some\ndebts, of which he had made himself master for my ruin.  I was confined\nhere at his suit, when not yet recovered from the wounds I had received;\nthe dear woman, and these two boys, followed me, that we might starve\ntogether; but Providence interposed, and sent Mr. Mountford to our\nsupport.  He has relieved my family from the gnawings of hunger, and\nrescued me from death, to which a fever, consequent on my wounds and\nincreased by the want of every necessary, had almost reduced me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Inhuman villain!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I exclaimed, lifting up my eyes to heaven.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Inhuman indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lovely woman who stood at my side.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas!\nsir, what had we done to offend him? what had these little ones done,\nthat they should perish in the toils of his vengeance?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI reached a pen which stood in the inkstand dish at the bed-side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098May I ask what is the amount of the sum for which you are imprisoned?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was able,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to pay all but five hundred crowns.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wrote a draft on the banker with whom I had a credit from my father\nfor 2,500, and presenting it to the stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will receive, madam, on presenting this note, a sum more than\nsufficient for your husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discharge; the remainder I leave for his\nindustry to improve.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have left the room.  Each of them laid hold of one of my hands,\nthe children clung to my coat.  Oh! Mr. Harley, methinks I feel their\ngentle violence at this moment; it beats here with delight inexpressible.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stay, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not mean attempting to thank you\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (he took a\npocket-book from under his pillow), \u00e2\u0080\u0098let me but know what name I shall\nplace here next to Mr. Mountford!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sedley.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe writ it down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098An Englishman too, I presume.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098He shall go to heaven, notwithstanding;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the boy who had been our\nguide.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt began to be too much for me.  I squeezed his hand that was clasped in\nmine, his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I pressed to my lips, and burst from the place, to give\nvent to the feelings that laboured within me.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, Mountford!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I, when he had overtaken me at the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that we should think of our appointment;\nyoung Respino and his friends are waiting us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Damn him, damn him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said I.  \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us leave Milan instantly; but soft\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwill be calm; Mountford, your pencil.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  I wrote on a slip of paper,\n\n                             \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098To Signor RESPINO.\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098When you receive this, I am at a distance from Milan.  Accept of my\n    thanks for the civilities I have received from you and your family.\n    As to the friendship with which you were pleased to honour me, the\n    prison, which I have just left, has exhibited a scene to cancel it\n    for ever.  You may possibly be merry with your companions at my\n    weakness, as I suppose you will term it.  I give you leave for\n    derision.  You may affect a triumph, I shall feel it.\n\n                                                          \u00e2\u0080\u009cEDWARD SEDLEY.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098You may send this if you will,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mountford, coolly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but still\nRespino is a _man of honour_; the world will continue to call him so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is probable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they may; I envy not the appellation.

There\nwere so very few connected passages of the subsequent chapters remaining,\nthat even the partiality of an editor could not offer them to the public.\nI discovered, from some scattered sentences, that they were of much the\nsame tenor with the preceding; recitals of little adventures, in which\nthe dispositions of a man, sensible to judge, and still more warm to\nfeel, had room to unfold themselves.  Some instruction, and some example,\nI make no doubt they contained; but it is likely that many of those, whom\nchance has led to a perusal of what I have already presented, may have\nread it with little pleasure, and will feel no disappointment from the\nwant of those parts which I have been unable to procure.  To such as may\nhave expected the intricacies of a novel, a few incidents in a life\nundistinguished, except by some features of the heart, cannot have\nafforded much entertainment.\n\nHarley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own story, from the mutilated passages I have mentioned, as well\nas from some inquiries I was at the trouble of making in the country, I\nfound to have been simple to excess.  His mistress, I could perceive, was\nnot married to Sir Harry Benson; but it would seem, by one of the\nfollowing chapters, which is still entire, that Harley had not profited\non the occasion by making any declaration of his own passion, after those\nof the other had been unsuccessful.  The state of his health, for some\npart of this period, appears to have been such as to forbid any thoughts\nof that kind: he had been seized with a very dangerous fever, caught by\nattending old Edwards in one of an infectious kind.  From this he had\nrecovered but imperfectly, and though he had no formed complaint, his\nhealth was manifestly on the decline.\n\nIt appears that the sagacity of some friend had at length pointed out to\nhis aunt a cause from which this might be supposed to proceed, to wit,\nhis hopeless love for Miss Walton; for, according to the conceptions of\nthe world, the love of a man of Harley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune for the heiress of\n\u00c2\u00a34,000 a year is indeed desperate.  Whether it was so in this case may be\ngathered from the next chapter, which, with the two subsequent,\nconcluding the performance, have escaped those accidents that proved\nfatal to the rest.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\nHE SEES MISS WALTON, AND IS HAPPY.\n\n\nHARLEY was one of those few friends whom the malevolence of fortune had\nyet left me; I could not therefore but be sensibly concerned for his\npresent indisposition; there seldom passed a day on which I did not make\ninquiry about him.\n\nThe physician who attended him had informed me the evening before, that\nhe thought him considerably better than he had been for some time past.\nI called next morning to be confirmed in a piece of intelligence so\nwelcome to me.\n\nWhen I entered his apartment, I found him sitting on a couch, leaning on\nhis hand, with his eye turned upwards in the attitude of thoughtful\ninspiration.  His look had always an open benignity, which commanded\nesteem; there was now something more\u00e2\u0080\u0094a gentle triumph in it.\n\nHe rose, and met me with his usual kindness.  When I gave him the good\naccounts I had had from his physician, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am foolish enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cto rely but little, in this instance, upon physic: my presentiment may\nbe false; but I think I feel myself approaching to my end, by steps so\neasy, that they woo me to approach it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a certain dignity in retiring from life at a time, when the\ninfirmities of age have not sapped our faculties.  This world, my dear\nCharles, was a scene in which I never much delighted.  I was not formed\nfor the bustle of the busy, nor the dissipation of the gay; a thousand\nthings occurred, where I blushed for the impropriety of my conduct when I\nthought on the world, though my reason told me I should have blushed to\nhave done otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u0094It was a scene of dissimulation, of restraint, of\ndisappointment.  I leave it to enter on that state which I have learned\nto believe is replete with the genuine happiness attendant upon virtue.\nI look back on the tenor of my life, with the consciousness of few great\noffences to account for.  There are blemishes, I confess, which deform in\nsome degree the picture.  But I know the benignity of the Supreme Being,\nand rejoice at the thoughts of its exertion in my favour.  My mind\nexpands at the thought I shall enter into the society of the blessed,\nwise as angels, with the simplicity of children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He had by this time\nclasped my hand, and found it wet by a tear which had just fallen upon\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0094His eye began to moisten too\u00e2\u0080\u0094we sat for some time silent.\u00e2\u0080\u0094At last,\nwith an attempt to a look of more composure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some\nremembrances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harley, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich rise involuntary on my heart, and make\nme almost wish to live.  I have been blessed with a few friends, who\nredeem my opinion of mankind.  I recollect, with the tenderest emotion,\nthe scenes of pleasure I have passed among them; but we shall meet again,\nmy friend, never to be separated.  There are some feelings which perhaps\nare too tender to be suffered by the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The world is in general\nselfish, interested, and unthinking, and throws the imputation of romance\nor melancholy on every temper more susceptible than its own.  I cannot\nthink but in those regions which I contemplate, if there is any thing of\nmortality left about us, that these feelings will subsist;\u00e2\u0080\u0094they are\ncalled,\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps they are\u00e2\u0080\u0094weaknesses here;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there may be some better\nmodifications of them in heaven, which may deserve the name of virtues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe sighed as he spoke these last words.  He had scarcely finished them,\nwhen the door opened, and his aunt appeared, leading in Miss Walton.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\ndear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009chere is Miss Walton, who has been so kind as to come\nand inquire for you herself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I could observe a transient glow upon his\nface.  He rose from his seat\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf to know Miss Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goodness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nhe, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe a title to deserve it, I have some claim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She begged him to\nresume his seat, and placed herself on the sofa beside him.  I took my\nleave.  Mrs. Margery accompanied me to the door.  He was left with Miss\nWalton alone.  She inquired anxiously about his health.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom the accounts which my physicians unwillingly give me, that\nthey have no great hopes of my recovery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094She started as he spoke; but\nrecollecting herself immediately, endeavoured to flatter him into a\nbelief that his apprehensions were groundless.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nit is usual with persons at my time of life to have these hopes, which\nyour kindness suggests; but I would not wish to be deceived.  To meet\ndeath as becomes a man, is a privilege bestowed on few.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would endeavour\nto make it mine;\u00e2\u0080\u0094nor do I think that I can ever be better prepared for it\nthan now:\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is that chiefly which determines the fitness of its\napproach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose sentiments,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Miss Walton, \u00e2\u0080\u009care just; but your\ngood sense, Mr. Harley, will own, that life has its proper value.\u00e2\u0080\u0094As the\nprovince of virtue, life is ennobled; as such, it is to be desired.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To\nvirtue has the Supreme Director of all things assigned rewards enough\neven here to fix its attachment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe subject began to overpower her.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harley lifted his eyes from the\nground\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, in a very low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are attachments,\nMiss Walton\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094His glance met hers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094They both betrayed a confusion, and\nwere both instantly withdrawn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He paused some moments\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am such a state\nas calls for sincerity, let that also excuse it\u00e2\u0080\u0094It is perhaps the last\ntime we shall ever meet.  I feel something particularly solemn in the\nacknowledgment, yet my heart swells to make it, awed as it is by a sense\nof my presumption, by a sense of your perfections\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He paused again\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\nit not offend you, to know their power over one so unworthy\u00e2\u0080\u0094It will, I\nbelieve, soon cease to beat, even with that feeling which it shall lose\nthe latest.\u00e2\u0080\u0094To love Miss Walton could not be a crime;\u00e2\u0080\u0094if to declare it is\none\u00e2\u0080\u0094the expiation will be made.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094Her tears were now flowing without\ncontrol.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me intreat you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto have better hopes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Let not\nlife be so indifferent to you; if my wishes can put any value on it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwill not pretend to misunderstand you\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know your worth\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have known it\nlong\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have esteemed it\u00e2\u0080\u0094What would you have me say?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have loved it as it\ndeserved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094He seized her hand\u00e2\u0080\u0094a languid colour reddened his cheek\u00e2\u0080\u0094a smile\nbrightened faintly in his eye.  As he gazed on her, it grew dim, it\nfixed, it closed\u00e2\u0080\u0094He sighed and fell back on his seat\u00e2\u0080\u0094Miss Walton screamed\nat the sight\u00e2\u0080\u0094His aunt and the servants rushed into the room\u00e2\u0080\u0094They found\nthem lying motionless together.\u00e2\u0080\u0094His physician happened to call at that\ninstant.  Every art was tried to recover them\u00e2\u0080\u0094With Miss Walton they\nsucceeded\u00e2\u0080\u0094But Harley was gone for ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\nTHE EMOTIONS OF THE HEART.\n\n\nI entered the room where his body lay; I approached it with reverence,\nnot fear: I looked; the recollection of the past crowded upon me.  I saw\nthat form which, but a little before, was animated with a soul which did\nhonour to humanity, stretched without sense or feeling before me.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a\nconnection we cannot easily forget:\u00e2\u0080\u0094I took his hand in mine; I repeated\nhis name involuntary;\u00e2\u0080\u0094I felt a pulse in every vein at the sound.  I\nlooked earnestly in his face; his eye was closed, his lip pale and\nmotionless.  There is an enthusiasm in sorrow that forgets impossibility;\nI wondered that it was so.  The sight drew a prayer from my heart: it was\nthe voice of frailty and of man! the confusion of my mind began to\nsubside into thought; I had time to meet!\n\nI turned with the last farewell upon my lips, when I observed old Edwards\nstanding behind me.  I looked him full in the face; but his eye was fixed\non another object: he pressed between me and the bed, and stood gazing on\nthe breathless remains of his benefactor.  I spoke to him I know not\nwhat; but he took no notice of what I said, and remained in the same\nattitude as before.  He stood some minutes in that posture, then turned\nand walked towards the door.  He paused as he went;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he returned a second\ntime: I could observe his lips move as he looked: but the voice they\nwould have uttered was lost.  He attempted going again; and a third time\nhe returned as before.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I saw him wipe his cheek: then covering his face\nwith his hands, his breast heaving with the most convulsive throbs, he\nflung out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSION.\n\n\nHE had hinted that he should like to be buried in a certain spot near the\ngrave of his mother.  This is a weakness; but it is universally incident\nto humanity: \u00e2\u0080\u0099tis at least a memorial for those who survive: for some\nindeed a slender memorial will serve;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the soft affections, when they\nare busy that way, will build their structures, were it but on the paring\nof a nail.\n\nHe was buried in the place he had desired.  It was shaded by an old tree,\nthe only one in the church-yard, in which was a cavity worn by time.  I\nhave sat with him in it, and counted the tombs.  The last time we passed\nthere, methought he looked wistfully on the tree: there was a branch of\nit that bent towards us waving in the wind; he waved his hand as if he\nmimicked its motion.  There was something predictive in his look! perhaps\nit is foolish to remark it; but there are times and places when I am a\nchild at those things.\n\nI sometimes visit his grave; I sit in the hollow of the tree.  It is\nworth a thousand homilies; every noble feeling rises within me! every\nbeat of my heart awakens a virtue!\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it will make you hate the\nworld\u00e2\u0080\u0094No: there is such an air of gentleness around, that I can hate\nnothing; but, as to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0094I pity the men of it.\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n{15}  The reader will remember that the Editor is accountable only for\nscattered chapters and fragments of chapters; the curate must answer for\nthe rest.  The number at the top, when the chapter was entire, he has\ngiven as it originally stood, with the title which its author had affixed\nto it.\n\n{61}  Though the Curate could not remember having shown this chapter to\nanybody, I strongly suspect that these political observations are the\nwork of a later pen than the rest of this performance.  There seems to\nhave been, by some accident, a gap in the manuscript, from the words,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExpectation at a jointure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to these, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn short, man is an animal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nwhere the present blank ends; and some other person (for the hand is\ndifferent, and the ink whiter) has filled part of it with sentiments of\nhis own.  Whoever he was, he seems to have caught some portion of the\nspirit of the man he personates.\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN OF FEELING***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 5083-0.txt or 5083-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/5\/0\/8\/5083\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":163,"split":"train"}
