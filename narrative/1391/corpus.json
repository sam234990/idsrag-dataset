By thinking, assessing and comparing these points, a commander can calculate his chances of victory. Habitual deviation from these calculations will ensure failure via improper action. The text stresses that war is a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration.\nWaging War (Chinese: \u4f5c\u6230\uff0c\u4f5c\u6218) explains how to understand the economy of warfare and how success requires winning decisive engagements quickly. This section advises that successful military campaigns require limiting the cost of competition and conflict.\nStrategic Attack (Chinese: \u8b00\u653b\uff0c\u8c0b\u653b) defines the source of strength as unity, not size, and discusses the five factors that are needed to succeed in any war. In order of importance, these critical factors are: Attack, Strategy, Alliances, Army and Cities.\nDisposition of the Army (Chinese: \u8ecd\u5f62\uff0c\u519b\u5f62) explains the importance of defending existing positions until a commander is capable of advancing from those positions in safety. It teaches commanders the importance of recognizing strategic opportunities, and teaches not to create opportunities for the enemy.\nForces (Chinese: \u5175\u52e2\uff0c\u5175\u52bf) explains the use of creativity and timing in building an army's momentum.\nWeaknesses and Strengths (Chinese: \u865b\u5be6\uff0c\u865a\u5b9e) explains how an army's opportunities come from the openings in the environment caused by the relative weakness of the enemy and how to respond to changes in the fluid battlefield over a given area.\nMilitary Maneuvers (Chinese: \u8ecd\u722d\uff0c\u519b\u4e89) explains the dangers of direct conflict and how to win those confrontations when they are forced upon the commander.\nVariations and Adaptability (Chinese: \u4e5d\u8b8a\uff0c\u4e5d\u53d8) focuses on the need for flexibility in an army's responses. It explains how to respond to shifting circumstances successfully.\nMovement and Development of Troops (Chinese: \u884c\u8ecd\uff0c\u884c\u519b) describes the different situations in which an army finds itself as it moves through new enemy territories, and how to respond to these situations. Much of this section focuses on evaluating the intentions of others.\nTerrain (Chinese: \u5730\u5f62) looks at the three general areas of resistance (distance, dangers and barriers) and the six types of ground positions that arise from them. Each of these six field positions offers certain advantages and disadvantages.\nThe Nine Battlegrounds (Chinese: \u4e5d\u5730) describes the nine common situations (or stages) in a campaign, from scattering to deadly, and the specific focus that a commander will need in order to successfully navigate them.\nAttacking with Fire (Chinese: \u706b\u653b) explains the general use of weapons and the specific use of the environment as a weapon. This section examines the five targets for attack, the five types of environmental attack and the appropriate responses to such attacks.\nIntelligence and Espionage (Chinese: \u7528\u9593\uff0c\u7528\u95f4) focuses on the importance of developing good information sources, and specifies the five types of intelligence sources and how to best manage each of them.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Art of War, by Sun Tzu\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Its introduction\nto Europe began in 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in\nChina, Joseph Amiot, acquired a copy of it, and translated it\ninto French.  It was not a good translation because, according to\nDr. Giles, \"[I]t contains a great deal that Sun Tzu did not\nwrite, and very little indeed of what he did.\"\n     The first translation into English was published in 1905 in\nTokyo by Capt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A.  However, this translation\nis, in the words of Dr. Giles, \"excessively bad.\"  He goes\nfurther in this criticism:  \"It is not merely a question of\ndownright blunders, from which none can hope to be wholly exempt.\nOmissions were frequent; hard passages were willfully distorted\nor slurred over.  Such offenses are less pardonable.  They would\nnot be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic, and\na similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in\ntranslations from Chinese.\"  In 1908 a new edition of Capt.\nCalthrop's translation was published in London.  It was an\nimprovement on the first -- omissions filled up and numerous\nmistakes corrected -- but new errors were created in the process.\nDr. Giles, in justifying his translation, wrote:  \"It was not\nundertaken out of any inflated estimate of my own powers; but I\ncould not help feeling that Sun Tzu deserved a better fate than\nhad befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I could hardly\nfail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\"\n     Clearly, Dr. Giles' work established much of the groundwork\nfor the work of later translators who published their own\neditions.  Of the later editions of the ART OF WAR I have\nexamined;  two feature Giles' edited translation and notes,  the\nother two present the same basic information from the ancient\nChinese commentators found in the Giles edition.  Of these four,\nGiles' 1910 edition is the most scholarly and presents the reader\nan incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu's text,\nmuch more than any other translation.\n     The Giles' edition of the ART OF WAR, as stated above, was a\nscholarly work.  Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time\nand an assistant in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and\nManuscripts in the British Museum.  Apparently he wanted to\nproduce a definitive edition, superior to anything else that\nexisted and perhaps something that would become a standard\ntranslation.  It was the best translation available for 50 years.\nBut apparently there was not much interest in Sun Tzu in English-\nspeaking countries since it took the start of the Second\nWorld War to renew interest in his work.  Several people\npublished unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzu.  In\n1944,  Dr. Giles' translation was edited and published in the\nUnited States in a series of military science books.  But it\nwasn't until 1963 that a good English translation (by Samuel B.\nGriffith and still in print) was published that was an equal to\nGiles' translation.  While this translation is more lucid than\nDr. Giles' translation, it lacks his copious notes that make his\nso interesting.\n     Dr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of\nthe Chinese civilization and language.  It contains the Chinese\ntext of Sun Tzu, the English translation, and voluminous notes\nalong with numerous footnotes.  Unfortunately, some of his notes\nand footnotes contain Chinese characters; some are completely\nChinese.  Thus,  a conversion to a Latin alphabet etext was\ndifficult.  I did the conversion in complete ignorance of Chinese\n(except for what I learned while doing the conversion).  Thus, I\nfaced the difficult task of paraphrasing it while retaining as\nmuch of the important text as I could.  Every paraphrase\nrepresents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of\nthe text as possible.  Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese\nconcordance, I was able to transliterate proper names, books, and\nthe like at the risk of making the text more obscure.  However,\nthe text, on the whole, is quite satisfactory for the casual\nreader, a transformation made possible by conversion to an etext.\nHowever, I come away from this task with the feeling of loss\nbecause I know that someone with a background in Chinese can do a\nbetter job than I did; any such attempt would be welcomed.\n\n                              Bob Sutton\n                              al876@cleveland.freenet.edu\n                              bobs@gnu.ai.mit.edu\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nSun Wu and his Book\n-------------------\n\n\n     Ssu-ma Ch`ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:  [1]\n--\n\n       Sun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch`i State.  His ART OF\n  WAR brought him to the notice of Ho Lu, [2] King of Wu.  Ho\n  Lu said to him:  \"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters.\n  May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight\n  test?\"\n       Sun Tzu replied:  \"You may.\"\n       Ho Lu asked:  \"May the test be applied to women?\"\n       The answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements\n  were made to bring 180 ladies out of the Palace.  Sun Tzu\n  divided them into two companies, and placed one of the King's\n  favorite concubines at the head of each.  He then bade them\n  all take spears in their hands, and addressed them thus:   \"I\n  presume you know the difference between front and back, right\n  hand and left hand?\"\n       The girls replied:  Yes.\n       Sun Tzu went on:  \"When I say \"Eyes front,\"  you must\n  look straight ahead.  When I say \"Left turn,\" you must face\n  towards your left hand.  When I say \"Right turn,\"  you must\n  face towards your right hand.  When I say \"About turn,\"  you\n  must face right round towards your back.\"\n       Again the girls assented.  The words of command having\n  been thus explained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes\n  in order to begin the drill.  Then, to the sound of drums, he\n  gave the order \"Right turn.\"  But the girls only burst out\n  laughing.  Sun Tzu said:  \"If words of command are not clear\n  and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then\n  the general is to blame.\"\n       So he started drilling them again, and this time gave\n  the order \"Left turn,\" whereupon the girls once more burst\n  into fits of laughter.  Sun Tzu:  \"If words of command are\n  not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly\n  understood, the general is to blame.  But if his orders ARE\n  clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the\n  fault of their officers.\"\n       So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies\n  to be beheaded.  Now the king of Wu was watching the scene\n  from the top of a raised pavilion; and when he saw that his\n  favorite concubines were about to be executed, he was greatly\n  alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following message:   \"We\n  are now quite satisfied as to our general's ability to handle\n  troops.  If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat\n  and drink will lose their savor.  It is our wish that they\n  shall not be beheaded.\"\n       Sun Tzu replied:  \"Having once received His Majesty's\n  commission to be the general of his forces, there are certain\n  commands of His Majesty which, acting in that capacity, I am\n  unable to accept.\"\n       Accordingly,  he had the two leaders beheaded,  and\n  straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in\n  their place.  When this had been done, the drum was sounded\n  for the drill once more; and the girls went through all the\n  evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching\n  ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect\n  accuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound.  Then\n  Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King saying:  \"Your soldiers,\n  Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and ready for\n  your majesty's inspection.  They can be put to any use that\n  their sovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and\n  water, and they will not disobey.\"\n       But the King replied:  \"Let our general cease drilling\n  and return to camp.  As for us, We have no wish to come down\n  and inspect the troops.\"\n       Thereupon Sun Tzu said:  \"The King is only fond of\n  words, and cannot translate them into deeds.\"\n       After that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how\n  to handle an army, and finally appointed him general.  In the\n  west, he defeated the Ch`u State and forced his way into\n  Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear into the States\n  of Ch`i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the\n  feudal princes.  And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.\n\n     About Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch`ien has to\ntell us in this chapter.  But he proceeds to give a biography of\nhis descendant,  Sun Pin, born about a hundred years after his\nfamous ancestor's death, and also the outstanding military genius\nof his time.  The historian speaks of him too as Sun Tzu, and in\nhis preface we read:  \"Sun Tzu had his feet cut off and yet\ncontinued to discuss the art of war.\" [3]  It seems likely, then,\nthat  \"Pin\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his mutilation,\nunless the story was invented in order to account for the name.\nThe crowning incident of his career, the crushing defeat of his\ntreacherous rival P`ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in\nChapter V. ss. 19, note.\n     To return to the elder Sun Tzu.  He is mentioned in two\nother passages of the SHIH CHI: --\n\n       In the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of\n  Wu, took the field with Tzu-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P`ei,\n  and attacked Ch`u.  He captured the town of Shu and slew the\n  two prince's sons who had formerly been generals of Wu.  He\n  was then meditating a descent on Ying [the capital]; but the\n  general Sun Wu said:  \"The army is exhausted.  It is not yet\n  possible.  We must wait\"....  [After further successful\n  fighting,]  \"in the ninth year  [506 B.C.],  King Ho Lu\n  addressed Wu Tzu-hsu and Sun Wu, saying:   \"Formerly, you\n  declared that it was not yet possible for us to enter Ying.\n  Is the time ripe now?\"  The two men replied:  \"Ch`u's general\n  Tzu-ch`ang, [4] is grasping and covetous, and the princes of\n  T`ang and Ts`ai both have a grudge against him.  If Your\n  Majesty has resolved to make a grand attack, you must win\n  over T`ang and Ts`ai, and then you may succeed.\"   Ho Lu\n  followed this advice, [beat Ch`u in five pitched battles and\n  marched into Ying.] [5]\n\n     This is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun\nWu.  He does not appear to have survived his patron, who died\nfrom the effects of a wound in 496.\n     In another chapter there occurs this passage:  [6]\n\n       From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers\n  arose, one after the other:  Kao-fan, [7] who was employed by\n  the Chin State; Wang-tzu, [8] in the service of Ch`i; and Sun\n  Wu, in the service of Wu.  These men developed and threw\n  light upon the principles of war.\n\n     It is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch`ien at least had no\ndoubt about the reality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and\nwith one exception, to be noticed presently, he is by far the\nmost important authority on the period in question.  It will not\nbe necessary, therefore, to say much of such a work as the WU\nYUEH CH`UN CH`IU, which is supposed to have been written by Chao\nYeh of the 1st century A.D.  The attribution is somewhat\ndoubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of\nlittle value, based as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with\nromantic details.  The story of Sun Tzu will be found, for what\nit is worth, in chapter 2.  The only new points in it worth\nnoting are:  (1)  Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu\nTzu-hsu.  (2) He is called a native of Wu.  (3) He had previously\nlived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his\nability.\n     The following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu:   \"When\nsovereign and ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible\neven for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\"  Assuming that this\nwork is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we\nhave here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu, for Huai-nan\nTzu died in 122 B.C., many years before the SHIH CHI was given to\nthe world.\n     Liu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says:  \"The reason why Sun Tzu at the\nhead of 30,000 men beat Ch`u with 200,000 is that the latter were\nundisciplined.\"\n     Teng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \"Sun\" was\nbestowed on Sun Wu's grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch`i [547-490\nB.C.].  Sun Wu's father Sun P`ing, rose to be a Minister of State\nin Ch`i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch`ang-ch`ing,  fled\nto Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the\nkindred of T`ien Pao.  He had three sons, of whom the second,\nnamed Ming, was the father of Sun Pin.  According to this account\nthen, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering that Sun\nPin's victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed\nas chronological impossible.  Whence these data were obtained by\nTeng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever\ncan be placed in them.\n     An interesting document which has survived from the close of\nthe Han period is the short preface written by the Great Ts`ao\nTs`ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzu.  I shall give it\nin full:  --\n\n       I have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to\n  their advantage. [10]  The SHU CHU mentions \"the army\" among\n  the \"eight objects of government.\"  The I CHING says:\n  \"'army' indicates firmness and justice;  the experienced\n  leader will have good fortune.\"  The SHIH CHING says:  \"The\n  King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshaled his\n  troops.\"  The Yellow Emperor, T`ang the Completer and Wu Wang\n  all used spears and battle-axes in order to succor their\n  generation.  The SSU-MA FA says:  \"If one man slay another of\n  set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain.\"  He who\n  relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he\n  who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.\n  Instances of this are Fu Ch`ai [11] on the one hand and Yen\n  Wang on the other. [12]  In military matters, the Sage's rule\n  is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only\n  when occasion requires.  He will not use armed force unless\n  driven to it by necessity.\n       Many books have I read on the subject of war and\n  fighting; but the work composed by Sun Wu is the profoundest\n  of them all.  [Sun Tzu was a native of the Ch`i state,  his\n  personal name was Wu.  He wrote the ART OF WAR in 13 chapters\n  for Ho Lu, King of Wu.  Its principles were tested on women,\n  and he was subsequently made a general.  He led an army\n  westwards,  crushed the Ch`u state and entered Ying the\n  capital.  In the north, he kept Ch`i and Chin in awe.  A\n  hundred years and more after his time, Sun Pin lived. He was\n  a descendant of Wu.] [13]  In his treatment of deliberation\n  and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field,\n  [14] clearness of conception, and depth of design,  Sun Tzu\n  stands beyond the reach of carping criticism.  My\n  contemporaries, however, have failed to grasp the full\n  meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice\n  the smaller details in which his work abounds,  they have\n  overlooked its essential purport.  That is the motive which\n  has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.\n\n     One thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit\nstatement that the 13 chapters were specially composed for King\nHo Lu.  This is supported by the internal evidence of I. ss. 15,\nin which it seems clear that some ruler is addressed.\n     In the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an\nentry which has given rise to much discussion:  \"The works of Sun\nTzu of Wu in 82 P`IEN (or chapters), with diagrams in 9 CHUAN.\"\nIt is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known to\nSsu-ma Ch`ien,  or those we possess today.  Chang Shou-chieh\nrefers to an edition of Sun Tzu's ART OF WAR of which the \"13\nchapters\" formed the first CHUAN, adding that there were two\nother CHUAN besides.  This has brought forth a theory, that the\nbulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other writings of Sun Tzu\n--  we should call them apocryphal -- similar to the WEN TA, of\nwhich a specimen dealing with the Nine Situations [15] is\npreserved in the T`UNG TIEN, and another in Ho Shin's commentary.\nIt is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had\nonly written the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of\nexegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and\nthe King.  Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU LU, backs\nthis up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH`UN CH`IU:  \"The King\nof Wu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of\nwar.  Each time he set forth a chapter of his work, the King\ncould not find words enough to praise him.\"  As he points out, if\nthe whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above-\nmentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail\nto be considerable.  Then the numerous other treatises attributed\nto Sun Tzu might be included.  The fact that the HAN CHIH\nmentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P`IEN, whereas the Sui\nand T`ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to\nthe \"13 chapters,\" is good proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of\nthese were contained in the 82 P`IEN.  Without pinning our faith\nto the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH`UN CH`IU,\nor admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi\nI-hsun,  we may see in this theory a probable solution of the\nmystery.  Between Ssu-ma Ch`ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of\ntime for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the\nmagic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P`IEN may very well represent a\ncollected edition of these lumped together with the original\nwork.  It is also possible, though less likely, that some of them\nexisted in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely\nignored by him. [16]\n     Tu Mu's conjecture seems to be based on a passage which\nstates:  \"Wei Wu Ti strung together Sun Wu's Art of War,\" which\nin turn may have resulted from a misunderstanding of the final\nwords of Ts`ao King's preface.  This, as Sun Hsing-yen points\nout, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory\nparaphrase, or in other words, wrote a commentary on it.  On the\nwhole, this theory has met with very little acceptance.  Thus,\nthe SSU K`U CH`UAN SHU says:  \"The mention of the 13 chapters in\nthe SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN\nCHIH, and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of\nthe original work.  Tu Mu's assertion can certainly not be taken\nas proof.\"\n     There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters\nexisted in the time of Ssu-ma Ch`ien practically as we have them\nnow.  That the work was then well known he tells us in so many\nwords.  \"Sun Tzu's 13 Chapters and Wu Ch`i's Art of War are the\ntwo books that people commonly refer to on the subject of\nmilitary matters.  Both of them are widely distributed, so I will\nnot discuss them here.\"  But as we go further back, serious\ndifficulties begin to arise.  The salient fact which has to be\nfaced is that the TSO CHUAN, the greatest contemporary record,\nmakes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a general or as\na writer.  It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance,\nthat many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun\nWu as given in the SHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly\nskeptical as to the existence of the man at all.  The most\npowerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in\nthe following disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin: [17] --\n\n       It is stated in Ssu-ma Ch`ien's history that Sun Wu was\n  a native of the Ch`i State, and employed by Wu; and that in\n  the reign of Ho Lu he crushed Ch`u, entered Ying, and was a\n  great general.  But in Tso's Commentary no Sun Wu appears at\n  all.  It is true that Tso's Commentary need not contain\n  absolutely everything that other histories contain.  But Tso\n  has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling\n  ruffians such as Ying K`ao-shu, [18] Ts`ao Kuei,  [19],  Chu\n  Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu [20].  In the case of Sun Wu, whose\n  fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much\n  more glaring.  Again, details are given, in their due order,\n  about his contemporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P`ei.  [21]\n  Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been passed\n  over?\n       In point of literary style, Sun Tzu's work belongs to\n  the same school as KUAN TZU, [22] LIU T`AO, [23] and the YUEH\n  YU [24] and may have been the production of some private\n  scholar living towards the end of the \"Spring and Autumn\" or\n  the beginning of the \"Warring States\" period. [25]  The story\n  that his precepts were actually applied by the Wu State, is\n  merely the outcome of big talk on the part of his followers.\n       From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty [26]\n  down to the time of the \"Spring and Autumn,\" all military\n  commanders were statesmen as well, and the class of\n  professional generals, for conducting external campaigns, did\n  not then exist.  It was not until the period of the \"Six\n  States\" [27] that this custom changed.  Now although Wu was\n  an uncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have\n  left unrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and\n  yet held no civil office?  What we are told, therefore, about\n  Jang-chu [28] and Sun Wu, is not authentic matter,  but the\n  reckless fabrication of theorizing pundits.  The story of Ho\n  Lu's experiment on the women, in particular, is utterly\n  preposterous and incredible.\n\n     Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch`ien as having said that\nSun Wu crushed Ch`u and entered Ying.  This is not quite correct.\nNo doubt the impression left on the reader's mind is that he at\nleast shared in these exploits.  The fact may or may not be\nsignificant; but it is nowhere explicitly stated in the SHIH CHI\neither that Sun Tzu was general on the occasion of the taking of\nYing, or that he even went there at all.  Moreover, as we know\nthat Wu Yuan and Po P`ei both took part in the expedition, and\nalso that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise\nof Fu Kai, Ho Lu's younger brother, it is not easy to see how yet\nanother general could have played a very prominent part in the\nsame campaign.\n     Ch`en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note: --\n\n       Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their\n  art.  But the fact that he does not appear in the TSO CHUAN,\n  although he is said to have served under Ho Lu King of Wu,\n  makes it uncertain what period he really belonged to.\n\nHe also says: --\n\n       The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch`i may be of genuine\n  antiquity.\n\n     It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch`en Chen-sun,\nwhile rejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma\nCh`ien's history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally\nassigned to the work which passes under his name.  The author of\nthe HSU LU fails to appreciate this distinction, and consequently\nhis bitter attack on Ch`en Chen-sun really misses its mark.  He\nmakes one of two points, however, which certainly tell in favor\nof the high antiquity of our \"13 chapters.\"  \"Sun Tzu,\" he says,\n\"must have lived in the age of Ching Wang [519-476], because he\nis frequently plagiarized in subsequent works of the Chou, Ch`in\nand Han dynasties.\"  The two most shameless offenders in this\nrespect are Wu Ch`i and Huai-nan Tzu, both of them important\nhistorical personages in their day.  The former lived only a\ncentury after the alleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known\nto have taken place in 381 B.C.  It was to him, according to Liu\nHsiang,  that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which had been\nentrusted to him by its author.  [29]   Now the fact that\nquotations from the ART OF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to\nbe found in so many authors of different epochs, establishes a\nvery strong anterior to them all, -- in other words, that Sun\nTzu's treatise was already in existence towards the end of the\n5th century B.C.  Further proof of Sun Tzu's antiquity is\nfurnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to\na number of the words he uses.  A list of these, which might\nperhaps be extended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of\nthe interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly\naffected thereby.  Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-\nhsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately\npronounces the style of the 13 chapters to belong to the early\npart of the fifth century.  Seeing that he is actually engaged in\nan attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu himself, we may be\nsure that he would not have hesitated to assign the work to a\nlater date had he not honestly believed the contrary.  And it is\nprecisely on such a point that the judgment of an educated\nChinaman will carry most weight.  Other internal evidence is not\nfar to seek.  Thus in XIII. ss. 1, there is an unmistakable\nallusion to the ancient system of land-tenure which had already\npassed away by the time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it\nrevived in a modified form. [30]  The only warfare Sun Tzu knows\nis that carried on between the various feudal princes, in which\narmored chariots play a large part.  Their use seems to have\nentirely died out before the end of the Chou dynasty.  He speaks\nas a man of Wu, a state which ceased to exist as early as 473\nB.C.  On this I shall touch presently.\n\n     But once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier,  and\nthe chances of its being other than a bona fide production are\nsensibly diminished.  The great age of forgeries did not come\nuntil long after.  That it should have been forged in the period\nimmediately following 473 is particularly unlikely, for no one,\nas a rule, hastens to identify himself with a lost cause.  As for\nYeh Shui-hsin's theory, that the author was a literary recluse,\nthat seems to me quite untenable.  If one thing is more apparent\nthan another after reading the maxims of Sun Tzu, it is that\ntheir essence has been distilled from a large store of personal\nobservation and experience.  They reflect the mind not only of a\nborn strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization,\nbut also of a practical soldier closely acquainted with the\nmilitary conditions of his time.  To say nothing of the fact that\nthese sayings have been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest\ncaptains of Chinese history, they offer a combination of\nfreshness and sincerity, acuteness and common sense, which quite\nexcludes the idea that they were artificially concocted in the\nstudy.  If we admit, then, that the 13 chapters were the genuine\nproduction of a military man living towards the end of the \"CH`UN\nCH`IU\" period, are we not bound, in spite of the silence of the\nTSO CHUAN, to accept Ssu-ma Ch`ien's account in its entirety?  In\nview of his high repute as a sober historian,  must we not\nhesitate to assume that the records he drew upon for Sun Wu's\nbiography were false and untrustworthy?  The answer, I fear, must\nbe in the negative.  There is still one grave, if not fatal,\nobjection to the chronology involved in the story as told in the\nSHIH CHI, which, so far as I am aware, nobody has yet pointed\nout.  There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he alludes to\ncontemporary affairs.  The first in in VI. ss. 21: --\n\n       Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh\n  exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing\n  in the matter of victory.  I say then that victory can be\n  achieved.\n\nThe other is in XI. ss. 30: --\n\n       Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I\n  should answer, Yes.  For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh\n  are enemies;  yet if they are crossing a river in the same\n  boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each\n  other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.\n\n     These two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of\nthe date of composition.  They assign the work to the period of\nthe struggle between Wu and Yueh.  So much has been observed by\nPi I-hsun.  But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they\nalso seriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch`ien's\nnarrative.  As we have seen above, the first positive date given\nin connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C.  He is then spoken of as a\ngeneral,  acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his\nalleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place, and\nof course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier still.\nBut at that time, and for several years after, down to the\ncapture of Ying in 506, Ch`u and not Yueh, was the great\nhereditary enemy of Wu.  The two states, Ch`u and Wu, had been\nconstantly at war for over half a century, [31] whereas the first\nwar between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, [32] and even then\nwas no more than a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the\nfierce struggle with Ch`u.  Now Ch`u is not mentioned in the 13\nchapters at all.  The natural inference is that they were written\nat a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that\nis, after Ch`u had suffered the great humiliation of 506.  At\nthis point, a table of dates may be found useful.\n\nB.C. |\n     |\n514  |  Accession of Ho Lu.\n512  |  Ho Lu attacks Ch`u, but is dissuaded from entering Ying,\n     |    the capital.  SHI CHI mentions Sun Wu as general.\n511  |  Another attack on Ch`u.\n510  |  Wu makes a successful attack on Yueh.  This is the first\n     |    war between the two states.\n509  |\n or  |  Ch`u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang.\n508  |\n506  |  Ho Lu attacks Ch`u with the aid of T`ang and Ts`ai.\n     |    Decisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Ying.  Last\n     |    mention of Sun Wu in SHIH CHI.\n505  |  Yueh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army.  Wu\n     |    is beaten by Ch`in and evacuates Ying.\n504  |  Ho Lu sends Fu Ch`ai to attack Ch`u.\n497  |  Kou Chien becomes King of Yueh.\n496  |  Wu attacks Yueh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li.\n     |    Ho Lu is killed.\n494  |  Fu Ch`ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fu-\n     |    chaio, and enters the capital of Yueh.\n485  |\n or  |  Kou Chien renders homage to Wu.  Death of Wu Tzu-hsu.\n484  |\n482  |  Kou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch`ai.\n478  |\n to  |  Further attacks by Yueh on Wu.\n476  |\n475  |  Kou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu.\n473  |  Final defeat and extinction of Wu.\n\n     The sentence quoted above from VI. ss. 21 hardly strikes me\nas one that could have been written in the full flush of victory.\nIt seems rather to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide\nhad turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the\nstruggle.  Hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in\nexistence in 505, before which date Yueh does not appear to have\nscored any notable success against Wu.  Ho Lu died in 496,  so\nthat if the book was written for him, it must have been during\nthe period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities,  Wu\nhaving presumably exhausted by its supreme effort against Ch`u.\nOn the other hand, if we choose to disregard the tradition\nconnecting Sun Wu's name with Ho Lu, it might equally well have\nseen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period\n482-473, when Yueh was once again becoming a very serious menace.\n[33]  We may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may\nhave been, was not a man of any great eminence in his own day.\nOn this point the negative testimony of the TSO CHUAN far\noutweighs any shred of authority still attaching to the SHIH CHI,\nif once its other facts are discredited.  Sun Hsing-yen, however,\nmakes a feeble attempt to explain the omission of his name from\nthe great commentary.  It was Wu Tzu-hsu, he says, who got all\nthe credit of Sun Wu's exploits, because the latter  (being an\nalien) was not rewarded with an office in the State.\n     How then did the Sun Tzu legend originate?  It may be that\nthe growing celebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of\nfactitious renown to its author.  It was felt to be only right\nand proper that one so well versed in the science of war should\nhave solid achievements to his credit as well.  Now the capture\nof Ying was undoubtedly the greatest feat of arms in Ho Lu's\nreign;  it made a deep and lasting impression on all the\nsurrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of\nher power.  Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that\nthe acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly\nidentified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense\nthat his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was\nactually carried out by him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34]  Po\nP`ei and Fu Kai?\n     It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the\noutline of Sun Tzu's life must be based almost wholly on\nconjecture.  With this necessary proviso, I should say that he\nprobably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu's\naccession,  and gathered experience, though only in the capacity\nof a subordinate officer, during the intense military activity\nwhich marked the first half of the prince's reign. [35]   If he\nrose to be a general at all, he certainly was never on an equal\nfooting with the three above mentioned.  He was doubtless present\nat the investment and occupation of Ying,  and witnessed Wu's\nsudden collapse in the following year.  Yueh's attack at this\ncritical juncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side,\nseems to have convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the\ngreat enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be\ndirected.  Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat\ndown to write his famous book, which according to my reckoning\nmust have appeared towards the end, rather than the beginning of\nHo Lu's reign.  The story of the women may possibly have grown\nout of some real incident occurring about the same time.  As we\nhear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly\nlikely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the\ndeath-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at Tsui-\nli.\n     If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a\ncertain irony in the fate which decreed that China's most\nillustrious man of peace should be contemporary with her greatest\nwriter on war.\n\n\nThe Text of Sun Tzu\n-------------------\n\n\n     I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of\nSun Tzu's text.  The quotations that occur in early authors go to\nshow that the \"13 chapters\" of which Ssu-ma Ch`ien speaks were\nessentially the same as those now extant.  We have his word for\nit that they were widely circulated in his day,  and can only\nregret that he refrained from discussing them on that account.\nSun Hsing-yen says in his preface: --\n\n       During the Ch`in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu's ART OF WAR\n  was in general use amongst military commanders, but they seem\n  to have treated it as a work of mysterious import, and were\n  unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity.  Thus\n  it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write a commentary\n  on it.\n\n     As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to\nsuppose that Ts`ao Kung tampered with the text.  But the text\nitself is often so obscure, and the number of editions which\nappeared from that time onward so great, especially during the\nT`ang and Sung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous\ncorruptions had not managed to creep in.  Towards the middle of\nthe Sung period, by which time all the chief commentaries on Sun\nTzu were in existence, a certain Chi T`ien-pao published a work\nin 15 CHUAN entitled \"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of\nten writers.\"  There was another text, with variant readings put\nforward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters among\nthe scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-\nyen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no\nlonger put into circulation.  Thus, until the end of the 18th\ncentury, the text in sole possession of the field was one derived\nfrom Chi T`ien-pao's edition, although no actual copy of that\nimportant work was known to have survived.  That, therefore,  is\nthe text of Sun Tzu which appears in the War section of the great\nImperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU CHIN T`U SHU CHI\nCH`ENG.  Another copy at my disposal of what is practically the\nsame text,  with slight variations, is that contained in the\n\"Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch`in dynasties\"  [1758].\nAnd the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop's first edition is\nevidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese\nchannels.  So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818],  a\ndistinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to\nbe an actual descendant of Sun Wu, [36] accidentally discovered a\ncopy of Chi T`ien-pao's long-lost work, when on a visit to the\nlibrary of the Hua-yin temple. [37]  Appended to it was the I\nSHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, mentioned in the T`UNG CHIH,  and also\nbelieved to have perished.  This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates\nas the \"original edition (or text)\" -- a rather misleading name,\nfor it cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun\nTzu in its pristine purity.  Chi T`ien-pao was a careless\ncompiler,  and appears to have been content to reproduce the\nsomewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to\ncollate   it   with the earliest   editions   then   available.\nFortunately,  two versions of Sun Tzu, even older than the newly\ndiscovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T`UNG TIEN,\nTu Yu's great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly\nenshrined in the T`AI P`ING YU LAN encyclopedia.  In both the\ncomplete text is to be found, though split up into fragments,\nintermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a\nnumber of different sections.  Considering that the YU LAN takes\nus back to the year 983, and the T`UNG TIEN about 200 years\nfurther still, to the middle of the T`ang dynasty, the value of\nthese early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated.\nYet the idea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to\nanyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions,\nundertook a thorough recension of the text.  This is his own\naccount: --\n\n       Because of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu\n  which his editors had handed down, the Government ordered\n  that the ancient edition [of Chi T`ien-pao] should be used,\n  and that the text should be revised and corrected throughout.\n  It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua, and Hsi,  a\n  graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to\n  this study, probably surpassing me therein.  Accordingly,  I\n  have had the whole work cut on blocks as a textbook for\n  military men.\n\n     The three individuals here referred to had evidently been\noccupied on the text of Sun Tzu prior to Sun Hsing-yen's\ncommission,  but we are left in doubt as to the work they really\naccomplished.  At any rate, the new edition,  when ultimately\nproduced, appeared in the names of Sun Hsing-yen and only one co-\neditor Wu Jen-shi.  They took the \"original edition\"  as their\nbasis, and by careful comparison with older versions, as well as\nthe extant commentaries and other sources of information such as\nthe I SHUO,  succeeded in restoring a very large number of\ndoubtful passages,  and turned out, on the whole, what must be\naccepted as the closes approximation we are ever likely to get to\nSun Tzu's original work.  This is what will hereafter be\ndenominated the \"standard text.\"\n     The copy which I have used belongs to a reissue dated 1877.\nit is in 6 PEN, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early\nphilosophical works in 83 PEN. [38]  It opens with a preface by\nSun Hsing-yen (largely quoted in this introduction),  vindicating\nthe traditional view of Sun Tzu's life and performances,  and\nsumming up in remarkably concise fashion the evidence in its\nfavor.  This is followed by Ts`ao Kung's preface to his edition,\nand the biography of Sun Tzu from the SHIH CHI, both translated\nabove.  Then come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien's I SHUO,  [39]  with\nauthor's preface, and next, a short miscellany of historical and\nbibliographical information entitled SUN TZU HSU LU, compiled by\nPi I-hsun.  As regards the body of the work,  each separate\nsentence is followed by a note on the text, if required, and then\nby the various commentaries appertaining to it,  arranged in\nchronological order.  These we shall now proceed to discuss\nbriefly, one by one.\n\n\nThe Commentators\n----------------\n\n\n     Sun Tzu can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll\nof commentators, which would do honor to any classic.  Ou-yang\nHsiu remarks on this fact, though he wrote before the tale was\ncomplete,  and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the\nartifices   of war,  being inexhaustible,  must therefore   be\nsusceptible of treatment in a great variety of ways.\n\n     1.  TS`AO TS`AO or Ts`ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti\n[A.D.  155-220].  There is hardly any room for doubt that the\nearliest commentary on Sun Tzu actually came from the pen of this\nextraordinary man, whose biography in the SAN KUO CHIH reads like\na romance.  One of the greatest military geniuses that the world\nhas seen, and Napoleonic in the scale of his operations, he was\nespecially famed for the marvelous rapidity of his marches, which\nhas found expression in the line \"Talk of Ts`ao Ts`ao, and Ts`ao\nTs`ao will appear.\"  Ou-yang Hsiu says of him that he was a great\ncaptain who \"measured his strength against Tung Cho, Lu Pu and\nthe two Yuan, father and son, and vanquished them all;  whereupon\nhe divided the Empire of Han with Wu and Shu, and made himself\nking.  It is recorded that whenever a council of war was held by\nWei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign,  he had all his\ncalculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not\nlose one battle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any\nparticular saw their armies incontinently beaten and put to\nflight.\"   Ts`ao Kung's notes on Sun Tzu,  models of austere\nbrevity, are so thoroughly characteristic of the stern commander\nknown to history, that it is hard indeed to conceive of them as\nthe work of a mere LITTERATEUR.  Sometimes,  indeed,  owing to\nextreme compression, they are scarcely intelligible and stand no\nless in need of a commentary than the text itself. [40]\n\n     2.  MENG SHIH.  The commentary which has come down to us\nunder this name is comparatively meager, and nothing about the\nauthor is known.  Even his personal name has not been recorded.\nChi T`ien-pao's edition places him after Chia Lin,and Ch`ao Kung-\nwu also assigns him to the T`ang dynasty, [41] but this is a\nmistake.  In Sun Hsing-yen's preface, he appears as Meng Shih of\nthe Liang dynasty [502-557].  Others would identify him with Meng\nK`ang of the 3rd century.  He is named in one work as the last of\nthe \"Five Commentators,\" the others being Wei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch`en\nHao and Chia Lin.\n\n     3.  LI CH`UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on\nmilitary tactics.  One of his works has been in constant use down\nto the present day.  The T`UNG CHIH mentions \"Lives of famous\ngenerals from the Chou to the T`ang dynasty\" as written by him.\n[42]  According to Ch`ao Kung-wu and the T`IEN-I-KO catalogue, he\nfollowed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs\nconsiderably from those now extant.  His notes are mostly short\nand to the point, and he frequently illustrates his remarks by\nanecdotes from Chinese history.\n\n     4.  TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary\non Sun Tzu,  his notes being taken from the T`UNG TIEN,  the\nencyclopedic treatise on the Constitution which was his life-\nwork.  They are largely repetitions of Ts`ao Kung and Meng Shih,\nbesides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient\ncommentaries of Wang Ling and others.  Owing to the peculiar\narrangement of T`UNG TIEN, he has to explain each passage on its\nmerits, apart from the context, and sometimes his own explanation\ndoes not agree with that of Ts`ao Kung, whom he always quotes\nfirst.  Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the  \"Ten\nCommentators,\"  he was added to their number by Chi T`ien-pao,\nbeing wrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu.\n\n     5.  TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet -- a\nbright star even in the glorious galaxy of the T`ang period.  We\nlearn from Ch`ao Kung-wu that although he had no practical\nexperience of war,  he was extremely fond of discussing the\nsubject,  and was moreover well read in the military history of\nthe CH`UN CH`IU and CHAN KUO eras.  His notes,  therefore,  are\nwell worth attention.  They are very copious, and replete with\nhistorical parallels.  The gist of Sun Tzu's work is thus\nsummarized by him:  \"Practice benevolence and justice, but on the\nother hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.\"\nHe further declared that all the military triumphs and disasters\nof the thousand years which had elapsed since Sun Tzu's death\nwould,  upon examination, be found to uphold and corroborate,  in\nevery particular,  the maxims contained in his book.  Tu Mu's\nsomewhat spiteful charge against Ts`ao Kung has already been\nconsidered elsewhere.\n\n     6.  CH`EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu.\nCh`ao Kung-wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary\non Sun Tzu because Ts`ao Kung's on the one hand was too obscure\nand subtle, and that of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and\ndiffuse.  Ou-yang Hsiu,  writing in the middle of the 11th\ncentury,  calls Ts`ao Kung, Tu Mu and Ch`en Hao the three chief\ncommentators on Sun Tzu,  and observes that Ch`en Hao   is\ncontinually attacking Tu Mu's shortcomings.  His commentary,\nthough not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his\npredecessors.\n\n     7.  CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T`ang dynasty,\nfor his commentary on Sun Tzu is mentioned in the T`ang Shu and\nwas afterwards republished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty\ntogether with those of Meng Shih and Tu Yu.  It is of somewhat\nscanty texture, and in point of quality, too, perhaps the least\nvaluable of the eleven.\n\n     8.  MEI YAO-CH`EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his \"style\"\nas Mei Sheng-yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction.  His\ncommentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great\nOu-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the following: --\n\n       Later scholars have misread Sun Tzu,  distorting his\n  words and trying to make them square with their own one-sided\n  views.  Thus, though commentators have not been lacking, only\n  a few have proved equal to the task.  My friend Sheng-yu has\n  not fallen into this mistake.  In attempting to provide a\n  critical commentary for Sun Tzu's work, he does not lose\n  sight of the fact that these sayings were intended for states\n  engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not\n  concerned with the military conditions prevailing under the\n  sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties, [43] nor with the\n  nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of War.\n  [44]  Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning\n  is always deep.  Whether the subject be marching an army,  or\n  handling soldiers, or estimating the enemy,  or controlling\n  the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated;\n  the sayings are bound together in strict logical sequence,\n  though this has been obscured by commentators who have\n  probably   failed to grasp their meaning.  In his   own\n  commentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the obstinate\n  prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring out the\n  true meaning of Sun Tzu himself.  In this way, the clouds of\n  confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear.  I\n  am convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down\n  side by side with the three great commentaries; and for a\n  great deal that they find in the sayings, coming generations\n  will have constant reason to thank my friend Sheng-yu.\n\n     Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am\ninclined to endorse this favorable judgment, and would certainly\nplace him above Ch`en Hao in order of merit.\n\n     9.  WANG HSI,  also of the Sung dynasty,  is decidedly\noriginal in some of his interpretations, but much less judicious\nthan Mei Yao-ch`en,  and on the whole not a very trustworthy\nguide.  He is fond of comparing his own commentary with that of\nTs`ao Kung, but the comparison is not often flattering to him.\nWe learn from Ch`ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised the ancient\ntext of Sun Tzu, filling up lacunae and correcting mistakes. [45]\n\n     10.  HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty.  The personal name of\nthis commentator is given as above by Cheng Ch`iao in the TUNG\nCHIH,  written about the middle of the twelfth century,  but he\nappears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes\nCh`ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown.  There\nseems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch`iao's statement,\notherwise I should have been inclined to hazard a guess and\nidentify him with one Ho Ch`u-fei, the author of a short treatise\non war,  who lived in the latter part of the 11th century.  Ho\nShih's commentary,  in the words of the T`IEN-I-KO catalogue,\n\"contains helpful additions\"  here and there,  but is chiefly\nremarkable for the copious extracts taken, in adapted form,  from\nthe dynastic histories and other sources.\n\n     11.  CHANG YU.  The list closes with a commentator of no\ngreat originality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of\nlucid exposition.  His commentator is based on that of Ts`ao\nKung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop in\nmasterly fashion.  Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much\nof Ts`ao Kung's commentary would have remained cloaked in its\npristine obscurity and therefore valueless.  His work is not\nmentioned in the Sung history, the T`UNG K`AO, or the YU HAI, but\nit finds a niche in the T`UNG CHIH, which also names him as the\nauthor of the \"Lives of Famous Generals.\" [46]\n     It is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all\nhave flourished within so short a space of time.  Ch`ao Kung-wu\naccounts for it by saying:  \"During the early years of the Sung\ndynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased\nto practice the art of war.  but when [Chao] Yuan-hao's rebellion\ncame [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after\ntime,  the Court made strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war,\nand military topics became the vogue amongst all the high\nofficials.  Hence it is that the commentators of Sun Tzu in our\ndynasty belong mainly to that period. [47]\n\n     Besides these eleven commentators, there are several others\nwhose work has not come down to us.  The SUI SHU mentions four,\nnamely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzu); Chang Tzu-\nshang;  Chia Hsu of Wei; [48] and Shen Yu of Wu.  The T`ANG SHU\nadds Sun Hao, and the T`UNG CHIH Hsiao Chi, while the T`U SHU\nmentions a Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu.  It is possible that\nsome of these may have been merely collectors and editors of\nother commentaries, like Chi T`ien-pao and Chi Hsieh,  mentioned\nabove.\n\n\nAppreciations of Sun Tzu\n------------------------\n\n\n     Sun Tzu has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of\nsome of China's greatest men.  Among the famous generals who are\nknown to have studied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned\nHan Hsin (d. 196 B.C.), [49] Feng I (d. 34 A.D.), [50]  Lu Meng\n(d. 219), [51] and Yo Fei (1103-1141). [52]  The opinion of Ts`ao\nKung,  who disputes with Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese\nmilitary annals,  has already been recorded.  [53]   Still more\nremarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men,\nsuch as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p`o), who wrote several\nessays on military topics,  all of which owe their   chief\ninspiration to Sun Tzu.  The following short passage by him is\npreserved in the YU HAI: [54] --\n\n       Sun Wu's saying, that in war one cannot make certain of\n  conquering,  [55]  is very different indeed from what other\n  books tell us. [56]  Wu Ch`i was a man of the same stamp as\n  Sun Wu:  they both wrote books on war, and they are linked\n  together in popular speech as \"Sun and Wu.\"  But Wu Ch`i's\n  remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and\n  more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan\n  as in Sun Tzu's work, where the style is terse,  but the\n  meaning fully brought out.\n\n     The following is an extract from the \"Impartial Judgments in\nthe Garden of Literature\" by Cheng Hou: --\n\n       Sun Tzu's 13 chapters are not only the staple and base\n  of all military men's training, but also compel the most\n  careful attention of scholars and men of letters.  His\n  sayings   are terse yet elegant,  simple   yet   profound,\n  perspicuous and eminently practical.  Such works as the LUN\n  YU, the I CHING and the great Commentary, [57] as well as the\n  writings of Mencius, Hsun K`uang and Yang Chu, all fall below\n  the level of Sun Tzu.\n\n     Chu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of\nthe criticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with\nthe venerated classical works.  Language of this sort, he says,\n\"encourages a ruler's bent towards unrelenting warfare and\nreckless militarism.\"\n\n\nApologies for War\n-----------------\n\n\n     Accustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest\npeace-loving nation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting\nthat her experience of war in all its phases has also been such\nas no modern State can parallel.  Her long military annals\nstretch back to a point at which they are lost in the mists of\ntime.  She had built the Great Wall and was maintaining a huge\nstanding army along her frontier centuries before the first Roman\nlegionary was seen on the Danube.  What with the perpetual\ncollisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with\nHuns,  Turks and other invaders after the centralization of\ngovernment,   the terrific upheavals which   accompanied   the\noverthrow of so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions\nand minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out\nagain one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash of\narms has never ceased to resound in one portion or another of the\nEmpire.\n     No less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains\nto whom China can point with pride.  As in all countries,  the\ngreatest are fond of emerging at the most fateful crises of her\nhistory.  Thus, Po Ch`i stands out conspicuous in the period when\nCh`in was entering upon her final struggle with the remaining\nindependent states.  The stormy years which followed the break-up\nof the Ch`in dynasty are illuminated by the transcendent genius\nof Han Hsin.  When the House of Han in turn is tottering to its\nfall,  the great and baleful figure of Ts`ao Ts`ao dominates the\nscene.  And in the establishment of the T`ang dynasty,one of the\nmightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li\nShih-min (afterwards the Emperor T`ai Tsung) was seconded by the\nbrilliant strategy of Li Ching.  None of these generals need fear\ncomparison with the greatest names in the military history of\nEurope.\n     In spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment,\nfrom Lao Tzu downwards, and especially as reflected in the\nstandard literature of Confucianism,  has been   consistently\npacific and intensely opposed to militarism in any form.  It is\nsuch an uncommon thing to find any of the literati defending\nwarfare on principle,  that I have thought it worth while to\ncollect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox view\nis upheld.  The following, by Ssu-ma Ch`ien, shows that for all\nhis ardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of\npeace at any price: --\n\n       Military weapons are the means used by the Sage to\n  punish violence and cruelty, to give peace to troublous\n  times,  to remove difficulties and dangers,  and to succor\n  those who are in peril.  Every animal with blood in its veins\n  and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked.  How\n  much more so will man, who carries in his breast the\n  faculties of love and hatred, joy and anger!   When he is\n  pleased,  a feeling of affection springs up within him;  when\n  angry, his poisoned sting is brought into play.  That is the\n  natural law which governs his being....  What then shall be\n  said of those scholars of our time,  blind to all great\n  issues, and without any appreciation of relative values,  who\n  can only bark out their stale formulas about  \"virtue\"  and\n  \"civilization,\" condemning the use of military weapons?  They\n  will surely bring our country to impotence and dishonor and\n  the loss of her rightful heritage; or, at the very least,\n  they will bring about invasion and rebellion,  sacrifice of\n  territory and general enfeeblement.  Yet they obstinately\n  refuse to modify the position they have taken up.  The truth\n  is that, just as in the family the teacher must not spare the\n  rod,  and punishments cannot be dispensed with in the State,\n  so military chastisement can never be allowed to fall into\n  abeyance in the Empire.  All one can say is that this power\n  will be exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others,  and\n  that among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others\n  rebellious. [58]\n\n     The next piece is taken from Tu Mu's preface to his\ncommentary on Sun Tzu: --\n\n       War may be defined as punishment, which is one of the\n  functions of government.  It was the profession of Chung Yu\n  and Jan Ch`iu, both disciples of Confucius.  Nowadays,  the\n  holding of trials and hearing of litigation, the imprisonment\n  of offenders and their execution by flogging in the market-\n  place,  are all done by officials.  But the wielding of huge\n  armies, the throwing down of fortified cities, the hauling of\n  women and children into captivity, and the beheading of\n  traitors  --  this is also work which is done by officials.\n  The objects of the rack and of military weapons   are\n  essentially the same.  There is no intrinsic difference\n  between the punishment of flogging and cutting off heads in\n  war.  For the lesser infractions of law, which are easily\n  dealt with, only a small amount of force need be employed:\n  hence the use of military weapons and wholesale decapitation.\n  In both cases, however, the end in view is to get rid of\n  wicked people, and to give comfort and relief to the good....\n       Chi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying:  \"Have you, Sir,  acquired\n  your military aptitude by study, or is it innate?\"   Jan Yu\n  replied:   \"It has been acquired by study.\" [59]   \"How can\n  that be so,\" said Chi-sun, \"seeing that you are a disciple of\n  Confucius?\"  \"It is a fact,\" replied Jan Yu; \"I was taught by\n  Confucius.  It is fitting that the great Sage should exercise\n  both civil and military functions, though to be sure my\n  instruction in the art of fighting has not yet gone very\n  far.\"\n       Now,  who the author was of this rigid distinction\n  between the \"civil\" and the \"military,\" and the limitation of\n  each to a separate sphere of action, or in what year of which\n  dynasty it was first introduced, is more than I can say.\n  But,  at any rate, it has come about that the members of the\n  governing class are quite afraid of enlarging on military\n  topics,  or do so only in a shamefaced manner.  If any are\n  bold enough to discuss the subject, they are at once set down\n  as eccentric individuals of coarse and brutal propensities.\n  This is an extraordinary instance in which,  through sheer\n  lack of reasoning, men unhappily lose sight of fundamental\n  principles.\n       When the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch`eng Wang, he\n  regulated ceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts\n  of scholarship and learning; yet when the barbarians of the\n  River Huai revolted, [60] he sallied forth and chastised\n  them.  When Confucius held office under the Duke of Lu, and a\n  meeting was convened at Chia-ku, [61] he said:  \"If pacific\n  negotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should\n  have been made beforehand.\"  He rebuked and shamed the\n  Marquis of Ch`i, who cowered under him and dared not proceed\n  to violence.  How can it be said that these two great Sages\n  had no knowledge of military matters?\n\n     We have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzu in high\nesteem.  He also appeals to the authority of the Classics: --\n\n       Our Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei,  said:\n  \"I have never studied matters connected with armies and\n  battalions.\"  [62]   Replying to K`ung Wen-tzu, he said:   I\n  have not been instructed about buff-coats and weapons.\"   But\n  if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he used\n  armed force against the men of Lai, so that the marquis of\n  Ch`i was overawed.  Again,  when the inhabitants of Pi\n  revolted; he ordered his officers to attack them,  whereupon\n  they were defeated and fled in confusion.  He once uttered\n  the words:  \"If I fight, I conquer.\" [63]  And Jan Yu also\n  said:    \"The   Sage exercises both civil   and   military\n  functions.\"  [64]   Can it be a fact that Confucius never\n  studied or received instruction in the art of war?   We can\n  only say that he did not specially choose matters connected\n  with armies and fighting to be the subject of his teaching.\n\n     Sun Hsing-yen,  the editor of Sun Tzu,  writes in similar\nstrain: --\n\n       Confucius said:  \"I am unversed in military matters.\"\n  [65]  He also said:  \"If I fight,  I conquer.\"   Confucius\n  ordered ceremonies and regulated music.  Now war constitutes\n  one of the five classes of State ceremonial, [66]  and must\n  not be treated as an independent branch of study.  Hence, the\n  words \"I am unversed in\" must be taken to mean that there are\n  things which even an inspired Teacher does not know.  Those\n  who have to lead an army and devise stratagems,  must learn\n  the art of war.  But if one can command the services of a\n  good general like Sun Tzu, who was employed by Wu Tzu-hsu,\n  there is no need to learn it oneself.  Hence the remark added\n  by Confucius:  \"If I fight, I conquer.\"\n       The men of the present day, however, willfully interpret\n  these words of Confucius in their narrowest sense, as though\n  he meant that books on the art of war were not worth reading.\n  With blind persistency, they adduce the example of Chao Kua,\n  who pored over his father's books to no purpose, [67]  as a\n  proof that all military theory is useless.  Again,  seeing\n  that books on war have to do with such things as opportunism\n  in designing plans, and the conversion of spies,  they hold\n  that the art is immoral and unworthy of a sage.  These people\n  ignore the fact that the studies of our scholars and the\n  civil administration of our officials also require steady\n  application and practice before efficiency is reached.  The\n  ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices to\n  botch their work. [68]  Weapons are baneful [69] and fighting\n  perilous;  and useless unless a general is in constant\n  practice, he ought not to hazard other men's lives in battle.\n  [70]  Hence it is essential that Sun Tzu's 13 chapters should\n  be studied.\n      Hsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi [71] in the\n  art of war.  Chi got a rough idea of the art in its general\n  bearings,  but would not pursue his studies to their proper\n  outcome,  the consequence being that he was finally defeated\n  and overthrown.  He did not realize that the tricks and\n  artifices of war are beyond verbal computation.  Duke Hsiang\n  of Sung and King Yen of Hsu were brought to destruction by\n  their misplaced humanity.  The treacherous and underhand\n  nature of war necessitates the use of guile and stratagem\n  suited to the occasion.  There is a case on record of\n  Confucius himself having violated an extorted oath, [72]  and\n  also of his having left the Sung State in disguise. [73]  Can\n  we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for disregarding truth and\n  honesty?\n\n\nBibliography\n------------\n\n\n     The following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after\nSun Tzu.  The notes on each have been drawn principally from the\nSSU K`U CH`UAN SHU CHIEN MING MU LU, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq.\n\n     1.  WU TZU, in 1 CHUAN or 6 chapters.  By Wu Ch`i  (d.  381\nB.C.).  A genuine work.  See SHIH CHI, ch. 65.\n\n     2.  SSU-MA FA, in 1 CHUAN or 5 chapters.  Wrongly attributed\nto Ssu-ma Jang-chu of the 6th century B.C.  Its date,  however,\nmust be early, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are\nconstantly to be met within its pages.  See SHIH CHI, ch. 64.\n     The SSU K`U CH`UAN SHU (ch. 99, f. 1)  remarks that the\noldest three treatises on war, SUN TZU, WU TZU and SSU-MA FA,\nare,  generally speaking, only concerned with things strictly\nmilitary  --  the art of producing,  collecting,  training and\ndrilling troops, and the correct theory with regard to measures\nof expediency, laying plans, transport of goods and the handling\nof soldiers -- in strong contrast to later works, in which the\nscience of war is usually blended with metaphysics,  divination\nand magical arts in general.\n\n     3.  LIU T`AO, in 6 CHUAN, or 60 chapters.  Attributed to Lu\nWang  (or Lu Shang, also known as T`ai Kung) of the 12th century\nB.C. [74]  But its style does not belong to the era of the Three\nDynasties.  Lu Te-ming (550-625 A.D.) mentions the work,  and\nenumerates the headings of the six sections so that the forgery\ncannot have been later than Sui dynasty.\n\n     4.  WEI LIAO TZU, in 5 CHUAN.  Attributed to Wei Liao  (4th\ncent. B.C.), who studied under the famous Kuei-ku Tzu.  The work\nappears to have been originally in 31 chapters, whereas the text\nwe possess contains only 24.  Its matter is sound enough in the\nmain,  though the strategical devices differ considerably from\nthose of the Warring States period.  It is been furnished with a\ncommentary by the well-known Sung philosopher Chang Tsai.\n\n     5.  SAN LUEH, in 3 CHUAN.  Attributed to Huang-shih Kung,  a\nlegendary personage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang\nLiang (d. 187 B.C.) in an interview on a bridge.  But here again,\nthe style is not that of works dating from the Ch`in or Han\nperiod.  The Han Emperor Kuang Wu [25-57 A.D.] apparently quotes\nfrom it in one of his proclamations; but the passage in question\nmay have been inserted later on,  in order to prove   the\ngenuineness of the work.  We shall not be far out if we refer it\nto the Northern Sung period [420-478 A.D.], or somewhat earlier.\n\n     6.  LI WEI KUNG WEN TUI, in 3 sections.  Written in the form\nof a dialogue between T`ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching,\nit is usually ascribed to the latter.  Competent authorities\nconsider it a forgery, though the author was evidently well\nversed in the art of war.\n\n     7.  LI CHING PING FA (not to be confounded with the\nforegoing)  is a short treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the\nT`ung Tien, but not published separately.  This fact explains its\nomission from the SSU K`U CH`UAN SHU.\n\n     8.  WU CH`I CHING, in 1 CHUAN.  Attributed to the legendary\nminister Feng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the\nHan dynasty (d. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the\ncelebrated general Ma Lung (d. 300 A.D.).  Yet the earliest\nmention of it is in the SUNG CHIH.  Although a forgery, the work\nis well put together.\n\n     Considering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko\nLiang has always been held, it is not surprising to find more\nthan one work on war ascribed to his pen.  Such are (1) the SHIH\nLIU TS`E (1 CHUAN), preserved in the YUNG LO TA TIEN; (2)  CHIANG\nYUAN  (1 CHUAN);  and  (3) HSIN SHU  (1 CHUAN),  which steals\nwholesale from Sun Tzu.  None of these has the slightest claim to\nbe considered genuine.\n     Most of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive\nsections devoted to the literature of war.  The following\nreferences may be found useful: --\n\n     T`UNG TIEN (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162.\n     T`AI P`ING YU LAN (983), ch. 270-359.\n     WEN HSIEN TUNG K`AO (13th cent.), ch. 221.\n     YU HAI (13th cent.), ch. 140, 141.\n     SAN TS`AI T`U HUI (16th cent).\n     KUANG PO WU CHIH (1607), ch. 31, 32.\n     CH`IEN CH`IO LEI SHU (1632), ch. 75.\n     YUAN CHIEN LEI HAN (1710), ch. 206-229.\n     KU CHIN T`U SHU CHI CH`ENG (1726), section XXX, esp. ch. 81-\n      90.\n     HSU WEN HSIEN T`UNG K`AO (1784), ch. 121-134.\n     HUANG CH`AO CHING SHIH WEN PIEN (1826), ch. 76, 77.\n\n     The bibliographical sections of certain historical works\nalso deserve mention: --\n\n     CH`IEN HAN SHU, ch. 30.\n     SUI SHU, ch. 32-35.\n     CHIU T`ANG SHU, ch. 46, 47.\n     HSIN T`ANG SHU, ch. 57,60.\n     SUNG SHIH, ch. 202-209.\n     T`UNG CHIH (circa 1150), ch. 68.\n\n     To these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the\nImperial Library: --\n\n     SSU K`U CH`UAN SHU TSUNG MU T`I YAO (1790), ch. 99, 100.\n\n\nFootnotes\n---------\n\n\n1.

Native critics refer to a\nwork of the Han dynasty, which says:  \"Ten LI outside the WU gate\n[of the city of Wu, now Soochow in Kiangsu] there is a great\nmound, raised to commemorate the entertainment of Sun Wu of Ch`i,\nwho excelled in the art of war, by the King of Wu.\"\n\n10.  \"They attached strings to wood to make bows, and sharpened\nwood to make arrows.  The use of bows and arrows is to keep the\nEmpire in awe.\"\n\n11.  The son and successor of Ho Lu.  He was finally defeated and\noverthrown by Kou chien, King of Yueh, in 473 B.C.  See post.\n\n12.  King Yen of Hsu, a fabulous being, of whom Sun Hsing-yen\nsays in his preface:  \"His humanity brought him to destruction.\"\n\n13.  The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T`U\nSHU, and may be an interpolation.  It was known, however to Chang\nShou-chieh of the T`ang dynasty, and appears in the T`AI P`ING YU\nLAN.\n\n14.  Ts`ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap.\nII, perhaps especially of ss. 8.\n\n15.  See chap. XI.\n\n16.  On the other hand, it is noteworthy that WU TZU, which is\nnot in 6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the HAN CHIH.\nLikewise, the CHUNG YUNG is credited with 49 chapters, though now\nonly in one only.  In the case of very short works, one is\ntempted to think that P`IEN might simply mean \"leaves.\"\n\n17.  Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223].\n\n18.

See infra, beginning of INTRODUCTION.\n\n24.  I do not know what this work, unless it be the last chapter\nof another work.  Why that chapter should be singled out,\nhowever, is not clear.\n\n25.  About 480 B.C.\n\n26.  That is, I suppose, the age of Wu Wang and Chou Kung.\n\n27.  In the 3rd century B.C.\n\n28.  Ssu-ma Jang-chu, whose family name was T`ien, lived in the\nlatter half of the 6th century B.C., and is also believed to have\nwritten a work on war.  See SHIH CHI, ch. 64, and infra at the\nbeginning of the INTRODUCTION.\n\n29.  See Legge's Classics, vol. V, Prolegomena p. 27.  Legge\nthinks that the TSO CHUAN must have been written in the 5th\ncentury, but not before 424 B.C.\n\n30.  See MENCIUS III. 1. iii. 13-20.\n\n31.  When Wu first appears in the CH`UN CH`IU in 584, it is\nalready at variance with its powerful neighbor.  The CH`UN CH`IU\nfirst mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601.\n\n32.  This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2.\n\n33.  There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud\nwould tend to grow more bitter after each encounter, and thus\nmore fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30.\n\n34.  With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse:  -- a\nspurious treatise on war has been fathered on him simply because\nhe was a great general.  Here we have an obvious inducement to\nforgery.  Sun Wu, on the other hand, cannot have been widely\nknown to fame in the 5th century.\n\n35.  From TSO CHUAN:  \"From the date of King Chao's accession\n[515] there was no year in which Ch`u was not attacked by Wu.\"\n\n36.  Preface ad fin:  \"My family comes from Lo-an, and we are\nreally descended from Sun Tzu.  I am ashamed to say that I only\nread my ancestor's work from a literary point of view, without\ncomprehending the military technique.  So long have we been\nenjoying the blessings of peace!\"\n\n37.  Hoa-yin is about 14 miles from T`ung-kuan on the eastern\nborder of Shensi.  The temple in question is still visited by\nthose about the ascent of the Western Sacred Mountain.  It is\nmentioned in a text as being \"situated five LI east of the\ndistrict city of Hua-yin.  The temple contains the Hua-shan\ntablet inscribed by the T`ang Emperor Hsuan Tsung [713-755].\"\n\n38.  See my \"Catalogue of Chinese Books\" (Luzac & Co., 1908), no.\n40.\n\n39.  This is a discussion of 29 difficult passages in Sun Tzu.\n\n40.  Cf.  Catalogue of the library of Fan family at Ningpo:  \"His\ncommentary is frequently obscure; it furnishes a clue, but does\nnot fully develop the meaning.\"\n\n41.  WEN HSIEN T`UNG K`AO, ch. 221.\n\n42.  It is interesting to note that M. Pelliot has recently\ndiscovered chapters 1, 4 and 5 of this lost work in the \"Grottos\nof the Thousand Buddhas.\"  See B.E.F.E.O., t. VIII, nos. 3-4, p.\n525.\n\n43.  The Hsia, the Shang and the Chou.  Although the last-named\nwas nominally existent in Sun Tzu's day, it retained hardly a\nvestige of power, and the old military organization had\npractically gone by the board.  I can suggest no other\nexplanation of the passage.\n\n44.  See CHOU LI, xxix. 6-10.\n\n45.  T`UNG K`AO, ch. 221.\n\n46.  This appears to be still extant.

The few Europeans who have yet had an opportunity of\nacquainting themselves with Sun Tzu are not behindhand in their\npraise.  In this connection, I may perhaps be excused for quoting\nfrom a letter from Lord Roberts, to whom the sheets of the\npresent work were submitted previous to publication:  \"Many of\nSun Wu's maxims are perfectly applicable to the present day, and\nno. 11 [in Chapter VIII] is one that the people of this country\nwould do well to take to heart.\"\n\n54.

LAYING PLANS\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the\ntitle of this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the\ntemple selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we\nshould say, in his tent.  See. ss. 26.]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  The art of war is of vital importance to\nthe State.\n     2.  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to\nsafety or to ruin.  Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on\nno account be neglected.\n     3.  The art of war, then, is governed by five constant\nfactors,  to be taken into account in one's deliberations,  when\nseeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.\n     4.  These are:  (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven;  (3)  Earth;\n(4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.\n\n     [It appears from what follows that Sun Tzu means by  \"Moral\nLaw\" a principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzu in its\nmoral aspect.  One might be tempted to render it by  \"morale,\"\nwere it not considered as an attribute of the ruler in ss. 13.]\n\n     5,  6.  The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete\naccord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless\nof their lives, undismayed by any danger.\n\n     [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying:   \"Without constant\npractice,  the officers will be nervous and undecided when\nmustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will\nbe wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand.\"]\n\n     7.  HEAVEN signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and\nseasons.\n\n     [The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of\ntwo words here.  Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft,\nwaxing and waning\" of Heaven.  Wang Hsi, however, may be right in\nsaying that what is meant is \"the general economy of Heaven,\"\nincluding the five elements, the four seasons, wind and clouds,\nand other phenomena.]\n\n     8.  EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and\nsecurity; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and\ndeath.\n     9.  The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of   wisdom,\nsincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.\n\n     [The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1)  humanity\nor benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect,  self-\ncontrol,  or \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good\nfaith.  Here \"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or\nbenevolence,\"  and the two military virtues of  \"courage\"  and\n\"strictness\"  substituted for \"uprightness of mind\"  and  \"self-\nrespect, self-control, or 'proper feeling.'\"]\n\n     10.  By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the\nmarshaling   of the army in its proper   subdivisions,   the\ngraduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads\nby which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military\nexpenditure.\n     11.  These five heads should be familiar to every general:\nhe who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will\nfail.\n     12.  Therefore,  in your deliberations,  when seeking to\ndetermine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of\na comparison, in this wise: --\n     13.  (1)   Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the\nMoral law?\n\n     [I.e., \"is in harmony with his subjects.\"  Cf. ss. 5.]\n\n     (2)  Which of the two generals has most ability?\n     (3)  With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and\nEarth?\n\n     [See ss. 7,8]\n\n     (4)  On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n\n     [Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts`ao Ts`ao  (A.D.\n155-220),  who was such a strict disciplinarian that once,  in\naccordance with his own severe regulations against injury to\nstanding crops, he condemned himself to death for having allowed\nhis horse to shy into a field of corn!  However,  in lieu of\nlosing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice\nby cutting off his hair.  Ts`ao Ts`ao's own comment on the\npresent passage is characteristically curt:  \"when you lay down a\nlaw,  see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the\noffender must be put to death.\"]\n\n     (5)  Which army is stronger?\n\n     [Morally as well as physically.  As Mei Yao-ch`en puts it,\nfreely rendered, \"ESPIRIT DE CORPS and 'big battalions.'\"]\n\n     (6)  On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\n\n     [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying:   \"Without constant\npractice,  the officers will be nervous and undecided when\nmustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will\nbe wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand.\"]\n\n     (7)   In which army is there the greater constancy both in\nreward and punishment?\n\n     [On which side is there the most absolute certainty that\nmerit will be properly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]\n\n     14.  By means of these seven considerations I can forecast\nvictory or defeat.\n     15.  The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon\nit, will conquer:   --let such a one be retained in command!  The\ngeneral that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it,  will\nsuffer defeat:  --let such a one be dismissed!\n\n     [The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzu's\ntreatise was composed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho\nLu, king of the Wu State.]\n\n     16.  While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself\nalso of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary\nrules.\n     17.  According as circumstances are favorable,  one should\nmodify one's plans.\n\n     [Sun Tzu,  as a practical soldier, will have none of the\n\"bookish theoric.\"  He cautions us here not to pin our faith to\nabstract principles; \"for,\" as Chang Yu puts it, \"while the main\nlaws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of\nall and sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in\nattempting to secure a favorable position in actual warfare.\"  On\nthe eve of the battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the\ncavalry,  went to the Duke of Wellington in order to learn what\nhis plans and calculations were for the morrow, because,  as he\nexplained, he might suddenly find himself Commander-in-chief and\nwould be unable to frame new plans in a critical moment.  The\nDuke listened quietly and then said:  \"Who will attack the first\ntomorrow -- I or Bonaparte?\"  \"Bonaparte,\" replied Lord Uxbridge.\n\"Well,\" continued the Duke, \"Bonaparte has not given me any idea\nof his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his,  how can\nyou expect me to tell you what mine are?\" [1] ]\n\n     18.  All warfare is based on deception.\n\n     [The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be\nadmitted by every soldier.  Col.  Henderson tells us   that\nWellington,  great in so many military qualities, was especially\ndistinguished by \"the extraordinary skill with which he concealed\nhis movements and deceived both friend and foe.\"]\n\n     19.  Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;  when\nusing our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near,  we\nmust make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away,  we\nmust make him believe we are near.\n     20.  Hold out baits to entice the enemy.  Feign disorder,\nand crush him.\n\n     [All commentators,  except Chang Yu, say, \"When he is in\ndisorder, crush him.\"  It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzu\nis still illustrating the uses of deception in war.]\n\n     21.  If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.  If\nhe is in superior strength, evade him.\n     22.  If your opponent is of choleric temper,  seek to\nirritate him.  Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n\n     [Wang Tzu,  quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician\nplays with his adversary as a cat plays with a mouse,  first\nfeigning weakness and immobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon\nhim.]\n\n     23.  If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\n\n     [This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch`en has the\nnote:  \"while we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire\nhimself out.\"  The YU LAN has \"Lure him on and tire him out.\"]\n\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\n\n     [Less plausible is the interpretation favored by most of the\ncommentators:   \"If sovereign and subject are in accord,  put\ndivision between them.\"]\n\n     24.  Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are\nnot expected.\n     25.  These military devices, leading to victory, must not be\ndivulged beforehand.\n     26.   Now the general who wins a battle makes   many\ncalculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.\n\n     [Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary\nfor a temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was\nabout to take the field, in order that he might there elaborate\nhis plan of campaign.]\n\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations\nbeforehand.  Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few\ncalculations to defeat:  how much more no calculation at all!  It\nis by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to\nwin or lose.\n\n\n[1]  \"Words on Wellington,\" by Sir. W. Fraser.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nII.  WAGING WAR\n\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung has the note:  \"He who wishes to fight must\nfirst count the cost,\" which prepares us for the discovery that\nthe subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from the\ntitle, but is primarily a consideration of ways and means.]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  In the operations of war, where there are\nin the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots,\nand a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers,\n\n     [The  \"swift chariots\" were lightly built and, according to\nChang Yu, used for the attack; the \"heavy chariots\" were heavier,\nand designed for purposes of defense.  Li Ch`uan, it is true,\nsays that the latter were light, but this seems hardly probable.\nIt is interesting to note the analogies between early Chinese\nwarfare and that of the Homeric Greeks.  In each case, the war-\nchariot was the important factor, forming as it did the nucleus\nround which was grouped a certain number of foot-soldiers.  With\nregard to the numbers given here, we are informed that each swift\nchariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy chariot by\n25 footmen,  so that the whole army would be divided up into a\nthousand battalions,  each consisting of two chariots and a\nhundred men.]\n\nwith provisions enough to carry them a thousand LI,\n\n     [2.78 modern LI go to a mile.  The length may have varied\nslightly since Sun Tzu's time.]\n\nthe expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment\nof guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on\nchariots and armor, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of\nsilver per day.  Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000\nmen.\n     2.  When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long\nin coming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardor will\nbe damped.  If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your\nstrength.\n     3.  Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of\nthe State will not be equal to the strain.\n     4.  Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped,\nyour strength exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains\nwill spring up to take advantage of your extremity.  Then no man,\nhowever wise, will be able to avert the consequences that must\nensue.\n     5.  Thus,  though we have heard of stupid haste in war,\ncleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.\n\n     [This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained\nby any of the commentators.  Ts`ao Kung, Li Ch`uan, Meng Shih, Tu\nYu,  Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch`en have notes to the effect that a\ngeneral,  though naturally stupid,  may nevertheless   conquer\nthrough sheer force of rapidity.  Ho Shih says:  \"Haste may be\nstupid,  but at any rate it saves expenditure of energy and\ntreasure;  protracted operations may be very clever,  but they\nbring calamity in their train.\"  Wang Hsi evades the difficulty\nby remarking:   \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old,\nwealth being expended, an empty exchequer and distress among the\npeople;  true cleverness insures against the occurrence of such\ncalamities.\"   Chang Yu says:   \"So long as victory can be\nattained,  stupid haste is preferable to clever dilatoriness.\"\nNow   Sun   Tzu says nothing whatever,  except   possibly   by\nimplication,   about ill-considered haste being better   than\ningenious but lengthy operations.  What he does say is something\nmuch more guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be\ninjudicious,  tardiness can never be anything but foolish --  if\nonly   because it means impoverishment to the nation.   In\nconsidering the point raised here by Sun Tzu, the classic example\nof Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind.  That\ngeneral deliberately measured the endurance of Rome against that\nof Hannibals's isolated army, because it seemed to him that the\nlatter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a\nstrange country.  But it is quite a moot question whether his\ntactics would have proved successful in the long run.  Their\nreversal it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a\nnegative presumption in their favor.]\n\n     6.  There is no instance of a country having benefited from\nprolonged warfare.\n     7.  It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the\nevils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of\ncarrying it on.\n\n     [That is, with rapidity.  Only one who knows the disastrous\neffects of a long war can realize the supreme importance of\nrapidity in bringing it to a close.  Only two commentators seem\nto favor this interpretation, but it fits well into the logic of\nthe context,  whereas the rendering, \"He who does not know the\nevils of war cannot appreciate its benefits,\"  is distinctly\npointless.]\n\n     8.  The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy,\nneither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice.\n\n     [Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in\nwaiting for reinforcements, nor will he return his army back for\nfresh supplies, but crosses the enemy's frontier without delay.\nThis may seem an audacious policy to recommend,  but with all\ngreat strategists, from Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte,  the\nvalue of time -- that is, being a little ahead of your opponent --\nhas counted for more than either numerical superiority or the\nnicest calculations with regard to commissariat.]\n\n     9.  Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the\nenemy.  Thus the army will have food enough for its needs.\n\n     [The   Chinese word translated here as  \"war   material\"\nliterally means \"things to be used\", and is meant in the widest\nsense.  It includes all the impedimenta of an army,  apart from\nprovisions.]\n\n     10.  Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be\nmaintained by contributions from a distance.  Contributing to\nmaintain an army at a distance causes the people to   be\nimpoverished.\n\n     [The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly\nwith the next,  though obviously intended to do so.   The\narrangement,   moreover,  is so awkward that I cannot   help\nsuspecting some corruption in the text.  It never seems to occur\nto Chinese commentators that an emendation may be necessary for\nthe sense, and we get no help from them there.  The Chinese words\nSun Tzu used to indicate the cause of the people's impoverishment\nclearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen\nsent their contributions of corn to the army direct.  But why\nshould it fall on them to maintain an army in this way,  except\nbecause the State or Government is too poor to do so?]\n\n     11.  On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes\nprices to go up; and high prices cause the people's substance to\nbe drained away.\n\n     [Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left\nits own territory.  Ts`ao Kung understands it of an army that has\nalready crossed the frontier.]\n\n     12.  When their substance is drained away,  the peasantry\nwill be afflicted by heavy exactions.\n     13,  14.  With this loss of substance and exhaustion of\nstrength,  the homes of the people will be stripped bare,  and\nthree-tenths of their income will be dissipated;\n\n     [Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted\nnot of 3\/10, but of 7\/10, of their income.  But this is hardly to\nbe extracted from our text.  Ho Shih has a characteristic tag:\n\"The PEOPLE being regarded as the essential part of the State,\nand FOOD as the people's heaven, is it not right that those in\nauthority should value and be careful of both?\"]\n\nwhile government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,\nbreast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,\nprotective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to\nfour-tenths of its total revenue.\n     15.  Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the\nenemy.  One cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to\ntwenty of one's own, and likewise a single PICUL of his provender\nis equivalent to twenty from one's own store.\n\n     [Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of\ntransporting one cartload to the front.  A PICUL is a unit of\nmeasure equal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).]\n\n     16.  Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused\nto anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy,\nthey must have their rewards.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"Rewards are necessary in order to make the\nsoldiers see the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you\ncapture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as rewards,  so\nthat all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on his\nown account.\"]\n\n     17.  Therefore in chariot fighting,  when ten or more\nchariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the\nfirst.  Our own flags should be substituted for those of the\nenemy,  and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with\nours.  The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept.\n     18.  This is called, using the conquered foe to augment\none's own strength.\n     19.  In war, then, let your great object be victory,  not\nlengthy campaigns.\n\n     [As Ho Shih remarks:  \"War is not a thing to be trifled\nwith.\"   Sun Tzu here reiterates the main lesson which this\nchapter is intended to enforce.\"]\n\n     20.  Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the\narbiter of the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether\nthe nation shall be in peace or in peril.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIII.  ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\n\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  In the practical art of war,  the best\nthing of all is to take the enemy's country whole and intact;  to\nshatter and destroy it is not so good.  So, too, it is better to\nrecapture an army entire than to destroy it,  to capture a\nregiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.\n\n     [The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa,\nconsisted nominally of 12500 men; according to Ts`ao Kung,  the\nequivalent of a regiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a\ndetachment consists from any number between 100 and 500, and the\nequivalent of a company contains from 5 to 100 men.  For the last\ntwo,  however,  Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5\nrespectively.]\n\n     2.  Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not\nsupreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the\nenemy's resistance without fighting.\n\n     [Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words\nof the old Chinese general.  Moltke's greatest triumph,  the\ncapitulation   of the huge French army at Sedan,  was   won\npractically without bloodshed.]\n\n     3.  Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the\nenemy's plans;\n\n     [Perhaps the word \"balk\" falls short of expressing the full\nforce of the Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of\ndefense,  whereby one might be content to foil the enemy's\nstratagems one after another, but an active policy of counter-\nattack.  Ho Shih puts this very clearly in his note:  \"When the\nenemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must anticipate\nhim by delivering our own attack first.\"]\n\nthe next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;\n\n     [Isolating him from his allies.  We must not forget that Sun\nTzu, in speaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous\nstates or principalities into which the China of his day was\nsplit up.]\n\nthe next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;\n\n     [When he is already at full strength.]\n\nand the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\n\n     4.  The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can\npossibly be avoided.\n\n     [Another sound piece of military theory.  Had the Boers\nacted upon it in 1899, and refrained from dissipating their\nstrength before Kimberley, Mafeking, or even Ladysmith,  it is\nmore than probable that they would have been masters of the\nsituation before the British were ready seriously to oppose\nthem.]\n\n     The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various\nimplements of war, will take up three whole months;\n\n     [It is not quite clear what the Chinese word,   here\ntranslated as \"mantlets\", described.  Ts`ao Kung simply defines\nthem as \"large shields,\" but we get a better idea of them from Li\nCh`uan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were\nassaulting the city walls at close quarters.  This seems to\nsuggest a sort of Roman TESTUDO, ready made.  Tu Mu says they\nwere wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks,  but this is\ndenied by Ch`en Hao.  See supra II. 14.  The name is also applied\nto turrets on city walls.  Of the \"movable shelters\" we get a\nfairly clear description from several commentators.  They were\nwooden missile-proof structures on four wheels,  propelled from\nwithin, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey\nparties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling\nup the encircling moat with earth.  Tu Mu adds that they are now\ncalled \"wooden donkeys.\"]\n\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take\nthree months more.\n\n     [These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to\nthe level of the enemy's walls in order to discover the weak\npoints in the defense, and also to destroy the fortified turrets\nmentioned in the preceding note.]\n\n     5.  The general, unable to control his irritation,  will\nlaunch his men to the assault like swarming ants,\n\n     [This vivid simile of Ts`ao Kung is taken from the spectacle\nof an army of ants climbing a wall.  The meaning is that the\ngeneral, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature\nattempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.]\n\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain,  while the\ntown still remains untaken.  Such are the disastrous effects of a\nsiege.\n\n     [We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese\nbefore Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to\nrecord.]\n\n     6.  Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops\nwithout any fighting; he captures their cities without laying\nsiege to them;  he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy\noperations in the field.\n\n     [Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government,  but\ndoes no harm to individuals.  The classical instance is Wu Wang,\nwho after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed\n\"Father and mother of the people.\"]\n\n     7.  With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of\nthe Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be\ncomplete.\n\n     [Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text,  the\nlatter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different\nmeaning:   \"And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use,  its\nkeenness remains perfect.\"]\n\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.\n     8.  It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the\nenemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;\n\n     [Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\n\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\n\n     [Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight,\nindeed,  it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war.\nTs'ao Kung, however, gives a clue to Sun Tzu's meaning:   \"Being\ntwo to the enemy's one, we may use one part of our army in the\nregular way, and the other for some special diversion.\"  Chang Yu\nthus further elucidates the point:  \"If our force is twice as\nnumerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up into two\ndivisions,  one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon\nhis rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed\nfrom behind;  if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in\nfront.\"   This is what is meant by saying that 'one part may be\nused in the regular way,  and the other for some special\ndiversion.'   Tu Mu does not understand that dividing one's army\nis simply an irregular, just as concentrating it is the regular,\nstrategical method,  and he is too hasty in calling this a\nmistake.\"]\n\n     9.  If equally matched, we can offer battle;\n\n     [Li Ch`uan,  followed by Ho Shih,  gives the following\nparaphrase:   \"If attackers and attacked are equally matched in\nstrength, only the able general will fight.\"]\n\nif slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;\n\n     [The meaning, \"we can WATCH the enemy,\" is certainly a great\nimprovement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be\nno very good authority for the variant.  Chang Yu reminds us that\nthe saying only applies if the other factors are equal; a small\ndifference in numbers is often more than counterbalanced by\nsuperior energy and discipline.]\n\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\n     10.  Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small\nforce, in the end it must be captured by the larger force.\n     11.  Now the general is the bulwark of the State;  if the\nbulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong;  if\nthe bulwark is defective, the State will be weak.\n\n     [As Li Ch`uan tersely puts it:  \"Gap indicates deficiency;\nif the general's ability is not perfect (i.e.  if he is not\nthoroughly versed in his profession),  his army will   lack\nstrength.\"]\n\n     12.  There are three ways in which a ruler can bring\nmisfortune upon his army:--\n     13.  (1)  By commanding the army to advance or to retreat,\nbeing ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.  This is called\nhobbling the army.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan adds the comment:  \"It is like tying together the\nlegs of a thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\"   One\nwould naturally think of \"the ruler\" in this passage as being at\nhome,  and trying to direct the movements of his army from a\ndistance.  But the commentators understand just the reverse,  and\nquote the saying of T`ai Kung:   \"A kingdom should not be\ngoverned from without,  and army should not be directed from\nwithin.\"   Of course it is true that, during an engagement,  or\nwhen in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in\nthe thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart.\nOtherwise, he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole,\nand give wrong orders.]\n\n     14.  (2)  By attempting to govern an army in the same way as\nhe administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which\nobtain in an army.  This causes restlessness in the soldier's\nminds.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung's note is, freely translated:   \"The military\nsphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle\nan army in kid gloves.\"  And Chang Yu says:   \"Humanity and\njustice are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an\narmy;  opportunism and flexibility,  on the other hand,  are\nmilitary rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of\nan army\"--to that of a State, understood.]\n\n     15.  (3)   By employing the officers of his army without\ndiscrimination,\n\n     [That is,  he is not careful to use the right man in the\nright place.]\n\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\ncircumstances.  This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n\n     [I follow Mei Yao-ch`en here.  The other commentators refer\nnot to the ruler, as in SS. 13, 14, but to the officers he\nemploys.  Thus Tu Yu says:  \"If a general is ignorant of the\nprinciple of adaptability,  he must not be entrusted with a\nposition of authority.\"  Tu Mu quotes:  \"The skillful employer of\nmen will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man,\nand the stupid man.  For the wise man delights in establishing\nhis merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the\ncovetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man\nhas no fear of death.\"]\n\n     16.  But when the army is restless and distrustful,  trouble\nis sure to come from the other feudal princes.  This is simply\nbringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away.\n     17.  Thus we may know that there are five essentials for\nvictory:  (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to\nfight.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  If he can fight, he advances and takes the\noffensive;  if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the\ndefensive.  He will invariably conquer who knows whether it is\nright to take the offensive or the defensive.]\n\n     (2)   He will win who knows how to handle both superior and\ninferior forces.\n\n     [This is not merely the general's ability to estimate\nnumbers correctly, as Li Ch`uan and others make out.  Chang Yu\nexpounds the saying more satisfactorily:  \"By applying the art of\nwar, it is possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater,  and\nvice versa.  The secret lies in an eye for locality, and in not\nletting the right moment slip.  Thus Wu Tzu says:   'With a\nsuperior force, make for easy ground; with an inferior one,  make\nfor difficult ground.'\"]\n\n     (3)  He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit\nthroughout all its ranks.\n     (4)   He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the\nenemy unprepared.\n     (5)   He will win who has military capacity and is not\ninterfered with by the sovereign.\n\n     [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying:  \"It is the sovereign's\nfunction to give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it\nis the function of the general.\"  It is needless to dilate on the\nmilitary disasters which have been caused by undue interference\nwith operations in the field on the part of the home government.\nNapoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to\nthe fact that he was not hampered by central authority.]\n\n     18.  Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know\nyourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.  If\nyou know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you\nwill also suffer a defeat.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch`in,  who\nin 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor.\nWhen warned not to despise an enemy who could command the\nservices of such men as Hsieh An and Huan Ch`ung, he boastfully\nreplied:   \"I have the population of eight provinces at my back,\ninfantry and horsemen to the number of one million;  why,  they\ncould dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely throwing their\nwhips   into   the stream.  What danger have I   to   fear?\"\nNevertheless,  his forces were soon after disastrously routed at\nthe Fei River, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]\n\nIf you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in\nevery battle.\n\n     [Chang Yu said:  \"Knowing the enemy enables you to take the\noffensive,   knowing yourself enables you to stand on   the\ndefensive.\"  He adds:  \"Attack is the secret of defense;  defense\nis the planning of an attack.\"  It would be hard to find a better\nepitome of the root-principle of war.]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIV.  TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\n\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for\nthe title of this chapter:  \"marching and countermarching on the\npart of the two armies with a view to discovering each other's\ncondition.\"   Tu Mu says:  \"It is through the dispositions of an\narmy that its condition may be discovered.  Conceal   your\ndispositions, and your condition will remain secret, which leads\nto victory,;  show your dispositions, and your condition will\nbecome patent, which leads to defeat.\"  Wang Hsi remarks that the\ngood general can \"secure success by modifying his tactics to meet\nthose of the enemy.\"]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  The good fighters of old first put\nthemselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for\nan opportunity of defeating the enemy.\n     2.  To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own\nhands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by\nthe enemy himself.\n\n     [That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy's part.]\n\n     3.  Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against\ndefeat,\n\n     [Chang Yu says this is done,  \"By concealing the disposition\nof his troops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting\nprecautions.\"]\n\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n     4.  Hence the saying:  One may KNOW how to conquer without\nbeing able to DO it.\n     5.  Security against defeat implies defensive tactics;\nability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.\n\n     [I retain the sense found in a similar passage in ss.  1-3,\nin spite of the fact that the commentators are all against me.\nThe meaning they give,  \"He who cannot conquer takes   the\ndefensive,\" is plausible enough.]\n\n     6.   Standing on the defensive indicates   insufficient\nstrength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.\n     7.  The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most\nsecret recesses of the earth;\n\n     [Literally,  \"hides under the ninth earth,\"  which is a\nmetaphor indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that\nthe enemy may not know his whereabouts.\"]\n\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost\nheights of heaven.\n\n     [Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary\nlike a thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare.\nThis is the opinion of most of the commentators.]\n\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the\nother, a victory that is complete.\n     8.  To see victory only when it is within the ken of the\ncommon herd is not the acme of excellence.\n\n     [As Ts`ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant\nbefore it has germinated,\" to foresee the event before the action\nhas begun.  Li Ch`uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who,  when\nabout to attack the vastly superior army of Chao,  which was\nstrongly entrenched in the city of Ch`eng-an,  said to his\nofficers:  \"Gentlemen, we are going to annihilate the enemy,  and\nshall meet again at dinner.\"  The officers hardly took his words\nseriously,  and gave a very dubious assent.  But Han Hsin had\nalready worked out in his mind the details of a clever stratagem,\nwhereby,  as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]\n\n     9.  Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and\nconquer and the whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"\n\n     [True excellence being, as Tu Mu says:  \"To plan secretly,\nto move surreptitiously, to foil the enemy's intentions and balk\nhis schemes, so that at last the day may be won without shedding\na drop of blood.\"  Sun Tzu reserves his approbation for things\nthat\n                    \"the world's coarse thumb\n               And finger fail to plumb.\"]\n\n     10.  To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\n\n     [\"Autumn\" hair\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is\nfinest in autumn, when it begins to grow afresh.  The phrase is a\nvery common one in Chinese writers.]\n\nto see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the\nnoise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n\n     [Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength,  sharp sight\nand quick hearing:  Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250\nstone;  Li Chu, who at a distance of a hundred paces could see\nobjects no bigger than a mustard seed; and Shih K`uang, a blind\nmusician who could hear the footsteps of a mosquito.]\n\n     11.  What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who\nnot only wins, but excels in winning with ease.\n\n     [The last half is literally \"one who, conquering, excels in\neasy conquering.\"   Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"He who only sees the\nobvious, wins his battles with difficulty; he who looks below the\nsurface of things, wins with ease.\"]\n\n     12.  Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for\nwisdom nor credit for courage.\n\n     [Tu Mu explains this very well:  \"Inasmuch as his victories\nare gained over circumstances that have not come to light,  the\nworld as large knows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation\nfor wisdom; inasmuch as the hostile state submits before there\nhas been any bloodshed, he receives no credit for courage.\"]\n\n     13.  He wins his battles by making no mistakes.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao says:   \"He plans no superfluous marches,  he\ndevises no futile attacks.\"  The connection of ideas is thus\nexplained by Chang Yu:  \"One who seeks to conquer by sheer\nstrength, clever though he may be at winning pitched battles,  is\nalso liable on occasion to be vanquished; whereas he who can look\ninto the future and discern conditions that are not yet manifest,\nwill never make a blunder and therefore invariably win.\"]\n\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory,\nfor it means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\n     14.  Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position\nwhich makes defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for\ndefeating the enemy.\n\n     [A  \"counsel of perfection\"  as Tu Mu truly   observes.\n\"Position\" need not be confined to the actual ground occupied by\nthe troops.  It includes all the arrangements and preparations\nwhich a wise general will make to increase the safety of his\narmy.]\n\n     15.  Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only\nseeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is\ndestined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\n     [Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox:  \"In warfare, first lay\nplans which will ensure victory, and then lead your army to\nbattle;  if you will not begin with stratagem but rely on brute\nstrength alone, victory will no longer be assured.\"]\n\n     16.  The consummate leader cultivates the moral law,  and\nstrictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his\npower to control success.\n     17.  In respect of military method,  we have,  firstly,\nMeasurement;   secondly,   Estimation   of   quantity;   thirdly,\nCalculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n     18.  Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of\nquantity to Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity;\nBalancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of\nchances.\n\n     [It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly\nin the Chinese.  The first seems to be surveying and measurement\nof the ground, which enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's\nstrength,  and to make calculations based on the data thus\nobtained; we are thus led to a general weighing-up, or comparison\nof the enemy's chances with our own; if the latter turn the\nscale,  then victory ensues.  The chief difficulty lies in third\nterm,   which in the Chinese some commentators take as   a\ncalculation of NUMBERS, thereby making it nearly synonymous with\nthe second term.  Perhaps the second term should be thought of as\na consideration of the enemy's general position or condition,\nwhile the third term is the estimate of his numerical strength.\nOn the other hand,  Tu Mu says:   \"The question of relative\nstrength having been settled, we can bring the varied resources\nof cunning into play.\"  Ho Shih seconds this interpretation,  but\nweakens it.  However, it points to the third term as being a\ncalculation of numbers.]\n\n     19.  A victorious army opposed to a routed one,  is as a\npound's weight placed in the scale against a single grain.\n\n     [Literally, \"a victorious army is like an I (20 oz.) weighed\nagainst a SHU (1\/24 oz.); a routed army is a SHU weighed against\nan I.\"   The point is simply the enormous advantage which a\ndisciplined force, flushed with victory, has over one demoralized\nby defeat.\"  Legge, in his note on Mencius, I. 2. ix.  2,  makes\nthe I to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects Chu Hsi's statement\nthat it equaled 20 oz. only.  But Li Ch`uan of the T`ang dynasty\nhere gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]\n\n     20.  The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting\nof pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nV.  ENERGY\n\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  The control of a large force is the same\nprinciple as the control of a few men:  it is merely a question\nof dividing up their numbers.\n\n     [That is,  cutting up the army into regiments,  companies,\netc.,  with subordinate officers in command of each.  Tu Mu\nreminds us of Han Hsin's famous reply to the first Han Emperor,\nwho once said to him:  \"How large an army do you think I could\nlead?\"   \"Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty.\"   \"And you?\"\nasked the Emperor.  \"Oh!\" he answered, \"the more the better.\"]\n\n     2.  Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise\ndifferent from fighting with a small one:   it is merely a\nquestion of instituting signs and signals.\n     3.  To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt\nof the enemy's attack and remain unshaken - this is effected by\nmaneuvers direct and indirect.\n\n     [We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun\nTzu's treatise, the discussion of the CHENG and the CH`I.\"  As it\nis by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two\nterms,   or   to render them consistently by   good   English\nequivalents;  it may be as well to tabulate some of   the\ncommentators'  remarks on the subject before proceeding further.\nLi Ch`uan:  \"Facing the enemy is CHENG, making lateral diversion\nis CH`I.  Chia Lin:  \"In presence of the enemy,  your troops\nshould be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\nvictory abnormal maneuvers must be employed.\"   Mei Yao-ch`en:\n\"CH`I is active, CHENG is passive; passivity means waiting for an\nopportunity, activity beings the victory itself.\"  Ho Shih:   \"We\nmust cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one\nthat is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus CHENG may also be\nCH`I,  and CH`I may also be CHENG.\"  He instances the famous\nexploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin-\nchin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across\nthe Yellow River in wooden tubs,  utterly disconcerting his\nopponent. [Ch`ien Han Shu, ch. 3.]  Here, we are told, the march\non Lin-chin was CHENG, and the surprise maneuver was CH`I.\"\nChang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of CH`I\nand CHENG.  Wei Liao Tzu [4th cent. B.C.] says:  'Direct warfare\nfavors frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.'\nTs`ao Kung says:  'Going straight out to join battle is a direct\noperation;   appearing on the enemy's rear is an   indirect\nmaneuver.'  Li Wei-kung [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says:  'In war,\nto march straight ahead is CHENG; turning movements, on the other\nhand, are CH`I.'  These writers simply regard CHENG as CHENG, and\nCH`I as CH`I;  they do not note that the two are mutually\ninterchangeable and run into each other like the two sides of a\ncircle [see infra, ss. 11].  A comment on the T`ang Emperor T`ai\nTsung goes to the root of the matter:  'A CH`I maneuver may be\nCHENG, if we make the enemy look upon it as CHENG; then our real\nattack will be CH`I, and vice versa.  The whole secret lies in\nconfusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.'\"\nTo put it perhaps a little more clearly:  any attack or other\noperation is CHENG, on which the enemy has had his attention\nfixed;  whereas that is CH`I,\" which takes him by surprise or\ncomes from an unexpected quarter.  If the enemy perceives a\nmovement which is meant to be CH`I,\"  it immediately becomes\nCHENG.\"]\n\n     4.  That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone\ndashed against an egg - this is effected by the science of weak\npoints and strong.\n     5.  In all fighting, the direct method may be used for\njoining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to\nsecure victory.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"Steadily develop indirect tactics,  either\nby pounding the enemy's flanks or falling on his rear.\"   A\nbrilliant example of  \"indirect tactics\"  which decided   the\nfortunes of a campaign was Lord Roberts' night march round the\nPeiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war. [1]\n\n     6.  Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible\nas Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams;\nlike the sun and moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four\nseasons, they pass away to return once more.\n\n     [Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of\nCH`I and CHENG.\"  But at present Sun Tzu is not speaking of CHENG\nat all,  unless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a\nclause relating to it has fallen out of the text.  Of course,  as\nhas already been pointed out, the two are so inextricably\ninterwoven in all military operations, that they cannot really be\nconsidered apart.  Here we simply have an expression,   in\nfigurative language, of the almost infinite resource of a great\nleader.]\n\n     7.  There are not more than five musical notes,  yet the\ncombinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can\never be heard.\n     8.  There are not more than five primary colors  (blue,\nyellow,  red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce\nmore hues than can ever been seen.\n     9   There are not more than five cardinal tastes  (sour,\nacrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more\nflavors than can ever be tasted.\n     10.  In battle,  there are not more than two methods of\nattack  -  the direct and the indirect;  yet these two   in\ncombination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.\n     11.  The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in\nturn.  It is like moving in a circle - you never come to an end.\nWho can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?\n     12.  The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which\nwill even roll stones along in its course.\n     13.  The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of\na falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.\n\n     [The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the\ncontext it is used defies the best efforts of the translator.  Tu\nMu defines this word as \"the measurement or estimation of\ndistance.\"  But this meaning does not quite fit the illustrative\nsimile in ss. 15.  Applying this definition to the falcon,  it\nseems to me to denote that instinct of SELF RESTRAINT which keeps\nthe bird from swooping on its quarry until the right moment,\ntogether with the power of judging when the right moment has\narrived.  The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly\nimportant one of being able to reserve their fire until the very\ninstant at which it will be most effective.  When the  \"Victory\"\nwent into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace,\nshe was for several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell\nbefore replying with a single gun.  Nelson coolly waited until he\nwas within close range, when the broadside he brought to bear\nworked fearful havoc on the enemy's nearest ships.]\n\n     14.  Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his\nonset, and prompt in his decision.\n\n     [The word \"decision\" would have reference to the measurement\nof distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before\nstriking.  But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzu meant to use\nthe word in a figurative sense comparable to our own idiom \"short\nand sharp.\"   Cf. Wang Hsi's note, which after describing the\nfalcon's mode of attack,  proceeds:  \"This is just how the\n'psychological moment' should be seized in war.\"]\n\n     15.  Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;\ndecision, to the releasing of a trigger.\n\n     [None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of\nthe simile of energy and the force stored up in the bent cross-\nbow until released by the finger on the trigger.]\n\n     16.  Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be\nseeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion\nand chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be\nproof against defeat.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"The subdivisions of the army having\nbeen previously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon,  the\nseparating and joining, the dispersing and collecting which will\ntake place in the course of a battle, may give the appearance of\ndisorder when no real disorder is possible.  Your formation may\nbe without head or tail, your dispositions all topsy-turvy,  and\nyet a rout of your forces quite out of the question.\"]\n\n     17.  Simulated disorder postulates perfect   discipline,\nsimulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates\nstrength.\n\n     [In order to make the translation intelligible,  it is\nnecessary to tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the\noriginal.  Ts`ao Kung throws out a hint of the meaning in his\nbrief note:   \"These things all serve to destroy formation and\nconceal one's condition.\"  But Tu Mu is the first to put it quite\nplainly:   \"If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the\nenemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to\ndisplay timidity in order to entrap the enemy,  you must have\nextreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to\nmake   the   enemy over-confident,  you must   have   exceeding\nstrength.\"]\n\n     18.  Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a\nquestion of subdivision;\n\n     [See supra, ss. 1.]\n\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of\nlatent energy;\n\n     [The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word\nhere differently than anywhere else in this chapter.  Thus Tu Mu\nsays:   \"seeing that we are favorably circumstanced and yet make\nno move, the enemy will believe that we are really afraid.\"]\n\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical\ndispositions.\n\n     [Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu,  the\nfirst Han Emperor:  \"Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out\nspies   to report on their condition.  But the   Hsiung-nu,\nforewarned,  carefully concealed all their able-bodied men and\nwell-fed horses, and only allowed infirm soldiers and emaciated\ncattle to be seen.  The result was that spies one and all\nrecommended the Emperor to deliver his attack.  Lou Ching alone\nopposed them, saying:  \"When two countries go to war,  they are\nnaturally inclined to make an ostentatious display of their\nstrength.  Yet our spies have seen nothing but old age and\ninfirmity.  This is surely some ruse on the part of the enemy,\nand it would be unwise for us to attack.\"  The Emperor,  however,\ndisregarding this advice, fell into the trap and found himself\nsurrounded at Po-teng.\"]\n\n     19.  Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the\nmove maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the\nenemy will act.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung's note is \"Make a display of weakness and want.\"\nTu Mu says:  \"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy's,\nweakness may be simulated in order to lure him on;  but if\ninferior, he must be led to believe that we are strong, in order\nthat he may keep off.  In fact, all the enemy's movements should\nbe determined by the signs that we choose to give him.\"  Note the\nfollowing anecdote of Sun Pin, a descendent of Sun Wu:   In 341\nB.C.,  the Ch`i State being at war with Wei, sent T`ien Chi and\nSun Pin against the general P`ang Chuan, who happened to be a\ndeadly personal enemy of the later.  Sun Pin said:   \"The Ch`i\nState has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary\ndespises us.  Let us turn this circumstance to   account.\"\nAccordingly,  when the army had crossed the border into Wei\nterritory,  he gave orders to show 100,000 fires on the first\nnight,  50,000 on the next, and the night after only 20,000.\nP`ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to himself:  \"I knew these\nmen of Ch`i were cowards:  their numbers have already fallen away\nby more than half.\"  In his retreat, Sun Pin came to a narrow\ndefile,  which he calculated that his pursuers would reach after\ndark.  Here he had a tree stripped of its bark,  and inscribed\nupon it the words:  \"Under this tree shall P`ang Chuan die.\"\nThen, as night began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers\nin ambush near by, with orders to shoot directly if they saw a\nlight.  Later on, P`ang Chuan arrived at the spot, and noticing\nthe tree, struck a light in order to read what was written on it.\nHis body was immediately riddled by a volley of arrows, and his\nwhole army thrown into confusion.  [The above is Tu Mu's version\nof the story; the SHIH CHI, less dramatically but probably with\nmore historical truth, makes P`ang Chuan cut his own throat with\nan exclamation of despair, after the rout of his army.] ]\n\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\n\n     20.  By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march;  then\nwith a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.\n\n     [With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads,\n\"He lies in wait with the main body of his troops.\"]\n\n     21.  The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined\nenergy, and does not require too much from individuals.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"He first of all considers the power of his\narmy in the bulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into\naccount,  and uses each men according to his capabilities.  He\ndoes not demand perfection from the untalented.\"]\n\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilize combined\nenergy.\n     22.  When he utilizes combined energy,  his fighting men\nbecome as it were like unto rolling logs or stones.  For it is\nthe nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level\nground, and to move when on a slope; if four-cornered, to come to\na standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling down.\n\n     [Ts`au Kung calls this \"the use of natural or inherent\npower.\"]\n\n     23.  Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as\nthe momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands\nof feet in height.  So much on the subject of energy.\n\n     [The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu's opinion,  is\nthe paramount importance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden\nrushes.  \"Great results,\" he adds, \"can thus be achieved with\nsmall forces.\"]\n\n\n[1]  \"Forty-one Years in India,\" chapter 46.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVI.  WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n\n\n     [Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as\nfollows:   \"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the\noffensive and the defensive; chapter V, on Energy,  dealt with\ndirect and indirect methods.  The good general acquaints himself\nfirst with the theory of attack and defense, and then turns his\nattention to direct and indirect methods.  He studies the art of\nvarying and combining these two methods before proceeding to the\nsubject of weak and strong points.  For the use of direct or\nindirect methods arises out of attack and defense,  and the\nperception of weak and strong points depends again on the above\nmethods.  Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the\nchapter on Energy.\"]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  Whoever is first in the field and awaits\nthe coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is\nsecond in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive\nexhausted.\n     2.  Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the\nenemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.\n\n     [One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own\nterms or fights not at all. [1] ]\n\n     3.  By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy\nto approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can\nmake it impossible for the enemy to draw near.\n\n     [In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the\nsecond,  he will strike at some important point which the enemy\nwill have to defend.]\n\n     4.  If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n\n     [This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao-\nCh`en's interpretation of I. ss. 23.]\n\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out;  if quietly\nencamped, he can force him to move.\n     5.  Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend;\nmarch swiftly to places where you are not expected.\n     6.  An army may march great distances without distress,  if\nit marches through country where the enemy is not.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung sums up very well:  \"Emerge from the void  [q.d.\nlike  \"a bolt from the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points,  shun\nplaces that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]\n\n     7.  You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you\nonly attack places which are undefended.\n\n     [Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that\nis to say,  where the general is lacking in capacity,  or the\nsoldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the\nprecautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late,  or\nprovisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst\nthemselves.\"]\n\nYou can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold\npositions that cannot be attacked.\n\n     [I.e.,  where there are none of the weak points mentioned\nabove.   There   is rather a nice point involved   in   the\ninterpretation of this later clause.  Tu Mu, Ch`en Hao, and Mei\nYao-ch`en assume the meaning to be:  \"In order to make your\ndefense quite safe, you must defend EVEN those places that are\nnot likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds:   \"How much more,\nthen,  those that will be attacked.\"  Taken thus,  however,  the\nclause   balances   less well with the   preceding--always   a\nconsideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural\nto the Chinese.  Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the\nmark in saying:  \"He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from\nthe topmost heights of heaven [see IV.  ss.  7],  making it\nimpossible for the enemy to guard against him.  This being so,\nthe places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy\ncannot defend....  He who is skilled in defense hides in the most\nsecret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy\nto estimate his whereabouts.  This being so, the places that I\nshall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]\n\n     8.  Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent\ndoes not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose\nopponent does not know what to attack.\n\n     [An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\n\n     9.  O divine art of subtlety and secrecy!  Through you we\nlearn to be invisible, through you inaudible;\n\n     [Literally,  \"without form or sound,\" but it is said of\ncourse with reference to the enemy.]\n\nand hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.\n     10.  You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you\nmake for the enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from\npursuit if your movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n     11.  If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an\nengagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and\na deep ditch.  All we need do is attack some other place that he\nwill be obliged to relieve.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"If the enemy is the invading party,  we can\ncut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he\nwill have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our\nattack against the sovereign himself.\"  It is clear that Sun Tzu,\nunlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in\nfrontal attacks.]\n\n     12.  If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy\nfrom engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be\nmerely traced out on the ground.  All we need do is to throw\nsomething odd and unaccountable in his way.\n\n     [This   extremely   concise   expression   is   intelligibly\nparaphrased by Chia Lin:  \"even though we have constructed\nneither wall nor ditch.\"  Li Ch`uan says:  \"we puzzle him by\nstrange and unusual dispositions;\" and Tu Mu finally clinches the\nmeaning by three illustrative anecdotes--one of Chu-ko Liang, who\nwhen occupying Yang-p`ing and about to be attacked by Ssu-ma I,\nsuddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and\nflung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in\nsweeping and sprinkling the ground.  This unexpected proceeding\nhad the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I,  suspecting an ambush,\nactually drew off his army and retreated.  What Sun Tzu is\nadvocating here,  therefore, is nothing more nor less than the\ntimely use of \"bluff.\"]\n\n     13.  By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining\ninvisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated,  while\nthe enemy's must be divided.\n\n     [The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu\n(after Mei Yao-ch`en) rightly explains it thus:  \"If the enemy's\ndispositions are visible,  we can make for him in one body;\nwhereas,  our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will\nbe obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack\nfrom every quarter.\"]\n\n     14.  We can form a single united body, while the enemy must\nsplit up into fractions.  Hence there will be a whole pitted\nagainst separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be\nmany to the enemy's few.\n     15.  And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force\nwith a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n     16.  The spot where we intend to fight must not be made\nknown; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible\nattack at several different points;\n\n     [Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's\nvictories by saying that \"while his opponents were kept fully\nemployed wondering what he was going to do, HE was thinking most\nof what he was going to do himself.\"]\n\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions,  the\nnumbers we shall have to face at any given point will be\nproportionately few.\n     17.  For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken\nhis rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van;\nshould he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right;  should\nhe strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.  If he sends\nreinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak.\n\n     [In Frederick the Great's INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS GENERALS we\nread:   \"A defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent\ndetachment.  Those generals who have had but little experience\nattempt to protect every point, while those who are better\nacquainted with their profession, having only the capital object\nin view, guard against a decisive blow, and acquiesce in small\nmisfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n\n     18.  Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against\npossible   attacks;  numerical strength,  from compelling   our\nadversary to make these preparations against us.\n\n     [The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is  \"to\ncompel the enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate\nsuperior force against each fraction in turn.\"]\n\n     19.  Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we\nmay concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n\n     [What Sun Tzu evidently has in mind is that nice calculation\nof distances and that masterly employment of strategy which\nenable a general to divide his army for the purpose of a long and\nrapid march, and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the\nright spot and the right hour in order to confront the enemy in\noverwhelming strength.  Among many such successful junctions\nwhich military history records, one of the most dramatic and\ndecisive was the appearance of Blucher just at the critical\nmoment on the field of Waterloo.]\n\n     20.  But if neither time nor place be known, then the left\nwing will be impotent to succor the right,  the right equally\nimpotent to succor the left, the van unable to relieve the rear,\nor the rear to support the van.  How much more so if the furthest\nportions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart,  and\neven the nearest are separated by several LI!\n\n     [The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in\nprecision,  but the mental picture we are required to draw is\nprobably that of an army advancing towards a given rendezvous in\nseparate columns, each of which has orders to be there on a fixed\ndate.  If the general allows the various detachments to proceed\nat haphazard,  without precise instructions as to the time and\nplace of meeting, the enemy will be able to annihilate the army\nin detail.  Chang Yu's note may be worth quoting here:  \"If we do\nnot know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the\nday on which they will join battle, our unity will be forfeited\nthrough our preparations for defense, and the positions we hold\nwill be insecure.  Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe,  we\nshall be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual\nsupport will be possible between wings,  vanguard or rear,\nespecially if there is any great distance between the foremost\nand hindmost divisions of the army.\"]\n\n     21.  Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh\nexceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in\nthe matter of victory.  I say then that victory can be achieved.\n\n     [Alas for these brave words!  The long feud between the two\nstates ended in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien\nand its incorporation in Yueh.  This was doubtless long after Sun\nTzu's death.  With his present assertion compare IV.  ss.  4.\nChang Yu is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy,\nwhich he thus goes on to explain:  \"In the chapter on Tactical\nDispositions it is said, 'One may KNOW how to conquer without\nbeing able to DO it,' whereas here we have the statement that\n'victory'  can be achieved.'  The explanation is,  that in the\nformer chapter,  where the offensive and defensive are under\ndiscussion,  it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared,  one\ncannot make certain of beating him.  But the present passage\nrefers particularly to the soldiers of Yueh who, according to Sun\nTzu's calculations,  will be kept in ignorance of the time and\nplace of the impending struggle.  That is why he says here that\nvictory can be achieved.\"]\n\n     22.  Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent\nhim from fighting.  Scheme so as to discover his plans and the\nlikelihood of their success.\n\n     [An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is:   \"Know\nbeforehand all plans conducive to our success and to the enemy's\nfailure.\"\n\n     23.  Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or\ninactivity.\n\n     [Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by\nthe enemy on being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude\nwhether his policy is to lie low or the reverse.  He instances\nthe action of Cho-ku Liang, who sent the scornful present of a\nwoman's head-dress to Ssu-ma I, in order to goad him out of his\nFabian tactics.]\n\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable\nspots.\n     24.  Carefully compare the opposing army with your own,  so\nthat you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is\ndeficient.\n\n     [Cf. IV. ss. 6.]\n\n     25.  In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you\ncan attain is to conceal them;\n\n     [The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation.\nConcealment is perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see supra\nss. 9) as \"showing no sign\" of what you mean to do, of the plans\nthat are formed in your brain.]\n\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying\nof the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest\nbrains.\n\n     [Tu Mu explains:  \"Though the enemy may have clever and\ncapable officers, they will not be able to lay any plans against\nus.\"]\n\n     26.  How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's\nown tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.\n     27.  All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what\nnone can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\n\n     [I.e., everybody can see superficially how a battle is won;\nwhat they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations\nwhich has preceded the battle.]\n\n     28.  Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one\nvictory,  but let your methods be regulated by the infinite\nvariety of circumstances.\n\n     [As Wang Hsi sagely remarks:  \"There is but one root-\nprinciple underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it\nare infinite in number.\"  With this compare Col. Henderson:  \"The\nrules of strategy are few and simple.  They may be learned in a\nweek.  They may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen\ndiagrams.  But such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an\narmy like Napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to\nwrite like Gibbon.\"]\n\n     29.  Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its\nnatural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\n     30.  So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to\nstrike at what is weak.\n\n     [Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]\n\n     31.  Water shapes its course according to the nature of the\nground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in\nrelation to the foe whom he is facing.\n     32.  Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape,  so\nin warfare there are no constant conditions.\n     33.  He who can modify his tactics in relation to his\nopponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-\nborn captain.\n     34.  The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are\nnot always equally predominant;\n\n     [That   is,   as   Wang   Hsi   says:    \"they   predominate\nalternately.\"]\n\nthe four seasons make way for each other in turn.\n\n     [Literally, \"have no invariable seat.\"]\n\nThere are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning\nand waxing.\n\n     [Cf.  V.  ss. 6.  The purport of the passage is simply to\nillustrate the want of fixity in war by the changes constantly\ntaking place in Nature.  The comparison is not very happy,\nhowever,  because the regularity of the phenomena which Sun Tzu\nmentions is by no means paralleled in war.]\n\n\n[1]   See Col. Henderson's biography of Stonewall Jackson,  1902\ned., vol. II, p. 490.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVII.  MANEUVERING\n\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  In war, the general receives his commands\nfrom the sovereign.\n     2.  Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he\nmust blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before\npitching his camp.\n\n     [\"Chang   Yu says:   \"the establishment of harmony   and\nconfidence between the higher and lower ranks before venturing\ninto the field;\" and he quotes a saying of Wu Tzu (chap.  1 ad\ninit.):   \"Without harmony in the State, no military expedition\ncan be undertaken; without harmony in the army, no battle array\ncan be formed.\"  In an historical romance Sun Tzu is represented\nas saying to Wu Yuan:  \"As a general rule, those who are waging\nwar should get rid of all the domestic troubles before proceeding\nto attack the external foe.\"]\n\n     3.  After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there\nis nothing more difficult.\n\n     [I    have   departed   slightly   from   the    traditional\ninterpretation of Ts`ao Kung, who says:   \"From the time of\nreceiving the sovereign's instructions until our encampment over\nagainst the enemy, the tactics to be pursued are most difficult.\"\nIt seems to me that the tactics or maneuvers can hardly be said\nto begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped,  and\nCh`ien Hao's note gives color to this view:   \"For levying,\nconcentrating,  harmonizing and entrenching an army,  there are\nplenty of old rules which will serve.  The real difficulty comes\nwhen we engage in tactical operations.\"  Tu Yu also observes that\n\"the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in\nseizing favorable position.\"]\n\nThe difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the\ndevious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.\n\n     [This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and\nsomewhat enigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzu is so fond.\nThis is how it is explained by Ts`ao Kung:  \"Make it appear that\nyou are a long way off, then cover the distance rapidly and\narrive on the scene before your opponent.\"   Tu Mu   says:\n\"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss and leisurely while\nyou are dashing along with utmost speed.\"   Ho Shih gives a\nslightly different turn:  \"Although you may have difficult ground\nto traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback\nwhich can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of\nmovement.\"   Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the\ntwo famous passages across the Alps--that of Hannibal, which laid\nItaly at his mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years\nlater, which resulted in the great victory of Marengo.]\n\n     4.  Thus,  to take a long and circuitous route,  after\nenticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him,\nto contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the\nartifice of DEVIATION.\n\n     [Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C.  to\nrelieve the town of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch`in\narmy.  The King of Chao first consulted Lien P`o on the\nadvisability of attempting a relief, but the latter thought the\ndistance too great, and the intervening country too rugged and\ndifficult.  His Majesty then turned to Chao She,  who fully\nadmitted the hazardous nature of the march, but finally said:\n\"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole--and the pluckier\none will win!\"  So he left the capital with his army,  but had\nonly gone a distance of 30 LI when he stopped and began\nthrowing   up   entrenchments.   For 28   days   he   continued\nstrengthening his fortifications, and took care that spies should\ncarry the intelligence to the enemy.  The Ch`in general was\noverjoyed,  and attributed his adversary's tardiness to the fact\nthat the beleaguered city was in the Han State,  and thus not\nactually part of Chao territory.  But the spies had no sooner\ndeparted than Chao She began a forced march lasting for two days\nand one night,  and arrive on the scene of action with such\nastonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding\nposition on the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his\nmovements.  A crushing defeat followed for the Ch`in forces,  who\nwere obliged to raise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat\nacross the border.]\n\n     5.  Maneuvering with an army is advantageous;  with an\nundisciplined multitude, most dangerous.\n\n     [I adopt the reading of the T`UNG TIEN, Cheng Yu-hsien and\nthe T`U SHU, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required\nin order to make sense.  The commentators using the standard text\ntake this line to mean that maneuvers may be profitable, or they\nmay be dangerous:  it all depends on the ability of the general.]\n\n     6.  If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to\nsnatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.\nOn the other hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose\ninvolves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores.\n\n     [Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\ncommentators,  who paraphrase the sentence.  I submit my own\nrendering without much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is\nsome deep-seated corruption in the text.  On the whole,  it is\nclear that Sun Tzu does not approve of a lengthy march being\nundertaken without supplies.  Cf. infra, ss. 11.]\n\n     7.  Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats,\nand make forced marches without halting day or night,  covering\ndouble the usual distance at a stretch,\n\n     [The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 LI;\nbut on one occasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts`ao Ts`ao is said\nto have covered the incredible distance of 300  _li_  within\ntwenty-four hours.]\n\ndoing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of\nall your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n     8.  The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will\nfall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will\nreach its destination.\n\n     [The moral is, as Ts`ao Kung and others point out:   Don't\nmarch a hundred LI to gain a tactical advantage, either with or\nwithout impedimenta.  Maneuvers of this description should be\nconfined to short distances.  Stonewall Jackson said:   \"The\nhardships of forced marches are often more painful than the\ndangers of battle.\"  He did not often call upon his troops for\nextraordinary exertions.  It was only when he intended   a\nsurprise,  or when a rapid retreat was imperative,  that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n\n     9.  If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy,\nyou will lose the leader of your first division, and only half\nyour force will reach the goal.\n\n     [Literally,  \"the leader of the first division will be\nTORN AWAY.\"]\n\n     10.  If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds\nof your army will arrive.\n\n     [In the T`UNG TIEN is added:  \"From this we may know the\ndifficulty of maneuvering.\"]\n\n     11.  We may take it then that an army without its baggage-\ntrain is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of\nsupply it is lost.\n\n     [I think Sun Tzu meant \"stores accumulated in depots.\"   But\nTu Yu says  \"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says  \"Goods in\ngeneral,\" and Wang Hsi says \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]\n\n     12.  We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted\nwith the designs of our neighbors.\n     13.  We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we\nare familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and\nforests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.\n     14.  We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account\nunless we make use of local guides.\n\n     [ss. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. ss. 52.]\n\n     15.  In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.\n\n     [In the tactics of Turenne,  deception of the   enemy,\nespecially as to the numerical strength of his troops,  took a\nvery prominent position. [2] ]\n\n     16.  Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops,  must\nbe decided by circumstances.\n     17.  Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\n\n     [The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not\nonly swift but,  as Mei Yao-ch`en points out,  \"invisible and\nleaves no tracks.\"]\n\nyour compactness that of the forest.\n\n     [Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note:   \"When\nslowly marching,  order and ranks must be preserved\"--so as to\nguard against surprise attacks.  But natural forest do not grow\nin rows, whereas they do generally possess the quality of density\nor compactness.]\n\n     18.  In raiding and plundering be like fire,\n\n     [Cf.  SHIH CHING, IV. 3. iv. 6:  \"Fierce as a blazing fire\nwhich no man can check.\"]\n\nin immovability like a mountain.\n\n     [That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is\ntrying to dislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is\ntrying to entice you into a trap.]\n\n     19.  Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night,  and\nwhen you move, fall like a thunderbolt.\n\n     [Tu Yu quotes a saying of T`ai Kung which has passed into a\nproverb:  \"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes\nto the lighting--so rapid are they.\"  Likewise, an attack should\nbe made so quickly that it cannot be parried.]\n\n     20.  When you plunder a countryside,  let the spoil be\ndivided amongst your men;\n\n     [Sun Tzu wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate\nplundering by insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a\ncommon stock,  which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst\nall.]\n\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the\nbenefit of the soldiery.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao says \"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let\nthem sow and plant it.\"  It is by acting on this principle,  and\nharvesting the lands they invaded,  that the Chinese   have\nsucceeded in carrying out some of their most memorable and\ntriumphant expeditions, such as that of Pan Ch`ao who penetrated\nto the Caspian, and in more recent years, those of Fu-k`ang-an\nand Tso Tsung-t`ang.]\n\n     21.  Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\n\n     [Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzu as saying that we must not\nbreak camp until we have gained the resisting power of the enemy\nand the cleverness of the opposing general.  Cf.  the  \"seven\ncomparisons\" in I. ss. 13.]\n\n     22.  He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of\ndeviation.\n\n     [See supra, SS. 3, 4.]\n\nSuch is the art of maneuvering.\n\n     [With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an\nend.  But there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an\nextract from an earlier book on War, now lost,  but apparently\nextant at the time when Sun Tzu wrote.  The style of this\nfragment is not noticeably different from that of Sun Tzu\nhimself,   but   no commentator raises a doubt as   to   its\ngenuineness.]\n\n     23.  The Book of Army Management says:\n\n     [It is perhaps significant that none of the   earlier\ncommentators give us any information about this work.  Mei Yao-\nCh`en calls it \"an ancient military classic,\" and Wang Hsi,  \"an\nold book on war.\"  Considering the enormous amount of fighting\nthat had gone on for centuries before Sun Tzu's time between the\nvarious kingdoms and principalities of China, it is not in itself\nimprobable that a collection of military maxims should have been\nmade and written down at some earlier period.]\n\nOn the field of battle,\n\n     [Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\n\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough:  hence the institution\nof gongs and drums.  Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly\nenough:  hence the institution of banners and flags.\n     24.  Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby\nthe ears and eyes of the host may be focused on one particular\npoint.\n\n     [Chang   Yu   says:    \"If sight   and   hearing   converge\nsimultaneously on the same object, the evolutions of as many as a\nmillion soldiers will be like those of a single man.\"!]\n\n     25.  The host thus forming a single united body,  is it\nimpossible either for the brave to advance alone,  or for the\ncowardly to retreat alone.\n\n     [Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who\nadvance against orders and those who retreat against orders.\"  Tu\nMu tells a story in this connection of Wu Ch`i,  when he was\nfighting against the Ch`in State.  Before the battle had begun,\none of his soldiers, a man of matchless daring, sallied forth by\nhimself, captured two heads from the enemy, and returned to camp.\nWu Ch`i had the man instantly executed,  whereupon an officer\nventured to remonstrate, saying:  \"This man was a good soldier,\nand ought not to have been beheaded.\"  Wu Ch`i replied:  \"I fully\nbelieve he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he\nacted without orders.\"]\n\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\n     26.  In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires\nand drums,  and in fighting by day, of flags and banners,  as a\nmeans of influencing the ears and eyes of your army.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi's night ride to Ho-yang at\nthe head of 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display\nwith torches, that though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a\nlarge army, he did not dare to dispute their passage.]\n\n     27.  A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;\n\n     [\"In war,\" says Chang Yu, \"if a spirit of anger can be made\nto pervade all ranks of an army at one and the same time,  its\nonset will be irresistible.  Now the spirit of the enemy's\nsoldiers will be keenest when they have newly arrived on the\nscene,  and it is therefore our cue not to fight at once, but to\nwait until their ardor and enthusiasm have worn off,  and then\nstrike.  It is in this way that they may be robbed of their keen\nspirit.\"   Li Ch`uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found in\nthe TSO CHUAN, year 10, ss. 1) of Ts`ao Kuei, a protege of Duke\nChuang of Lu.  The latter State was attacked by Ch`i,  and the\nduke was about to join battle at Ch`ang-cho, after the first roll\nof the enemy's drums, when Ts`ao said:  \"Not just yet.\"   Only\nafter their drums had beaten for the third time, did he give the\nword for attack.  Then they fought, and the men of Ch`i were\nutterly defeated.  Questioned afterwards by the Duke as to the\nmeaning of his delay,  Ts`ao Kuei replied:   \"In battle,  a\ncourageous spirit is everything.  Now the first roll of the drum\ntends to create this spirit, but with the second it is already on\nthe wane, and after the third it is gone altogether.  I attacked\nwhen their spirit was gone and ours was at its height.  Hence our\nvictory.\"   Wu Tzu (chap. 4) puts \"spirit\" first among the  \"four\nimportant influences\"  in war, and continues:  \"The value of a\nwhole army--a mighty host of a million men--is dependent on one\nman alone:  such is the influence of spirit!\"]\n\na commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"Presence of mind is the general's most\nimportant asset.  It is the quality which enables him to\ndiscipline disorder and to inspire courage into the panic-\nstricken.\"   The great general Li Ching (A.D.  571-649)  has a\nsaying:  \"Attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled\ncities or striking at an army in battle array; it must include\nthe art of assailing the enemy's mental equilibrium.\"]\n\n     28.  Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning;\n\n     [Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast.  At\nthe battle of the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to\nfight   fasting,  whereas Hannibal's men had breakfasted   at\ntheir leisure.  See Livy, XXI, liv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.]\n\nby noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is\nbent only on returning to camp.\n     29.  A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its\nspirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined\nto return.  This is the art of studying moods.\n     30.  Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of\ndisorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:--this is the art of\nretaining self-possession.\n     31.  To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from\nit, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to\nbe well-fed while the enemy is famished:--this is the art of\nhusbanding one's strength.\n     32.  To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are\nin perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in\ncalm   and confident array:--this is the art   of   studying\ncircumstances.\n     33.  It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against\nthe enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.\n     34.  Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight;  do not\nattack soldiers whose temper is keen.\n     35.  Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a\nmetaphor, take these words quite literally of food and drink that\nhave been poisoned by the enemy.  Ch`en Hao and Chang Yu\ncarefully point out that the saying has a wider application.]\n\nDo not interfere with an army that is returning home.\n\n     [The commentators explain this rather singular piece of\nadvice by saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home\nwill fight to the death against any attempt to bar his way,  and\nis therefore too dangerous an opponent to be tackled.  Chang Yu\nquotes the words of Han Hsin:  \"Invincible is the soldier who\nhath his desire and returneth homewards.\"  A marvelous tale is\ntold of Ts`ao Ts`ao's courage and resource in ch. 1 of the SAN\nKUO CHI:  In 198 A.D., he was besieging Chang Hsiu in Jang,  when\nLiu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to cutting off Ts`ao's\nretreat.  The latter was obliged to draw off his troops, only to\nfind himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were guarding\neach outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself.  In\nthis desperate plight Ts`ao waited until nightfall, when he bored\na tunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it.  As\nsoon as the whole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on\nhis rear,  while Ts`ao himself turned and met his pursuers in\nfront,  so that they were thrown into confusion and annihilated.\nTs`ao Ts`ao said afterwards:  \"The brigands tried to check my\narmy in its retreat and brought me to battle in a desperate\nposition:  hence I knew how to overcome them.\"]\n\n     36.  When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.\n\n     [This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to\nescape.  The object, as Tu Mu puts it, is \"to make him believe\nthat there is a road to safety, and thus prevent his fighting\nwith the courage of despair.\"  Tu Mu adds pleasantly:   \"After\nthat, you may crush him.\"]\n\nDo not press a desperate foe too hard.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao quotes the saying:   \"Birds and beasts when\nbrought to bay will use their claws and teeth.\"  Chang Yu says:\n\"If your adversary has burned his boats and destroyed his\ncooking-pots, and is ready to stake all on the issue of a battle,\nhe must not be pushed to extremities.\"  Ho Shih illustrates the\nmeaning by a story taken from the life of Yen-ch`ing.  That\ngeneral, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was surrounded\nby a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D.  The\ncountry was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force\nwas soon in dire straits for want of water.  The wells they bored\nran dry, and the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and\nsucking out the moisture.  Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at\nlast Fu Yen-ch`ing exclaimed:  \"We are desperate men.  Far better\nto die for our country than to go with fettered hands into\ncaptivity!\"   A strong gale happened to be blowing from the\nnortheast and darkening the air with dense clouds of sandy dust.\nTo Chung-wei was for waiting until this had abated before\ndeciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer, Li Shou-\ncheng by name,  was quicker to see an opportunity,  and said:\n\"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm\nour numbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the\nstrenuous fighter,  and the wind will be our best   ally.\"\nAccordingly,  Fu Yen-ch`ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected\nonslaught with his cavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded\nin breaking through to safety.]\n\n     37.  Such is the art of warfare.\n\n\n[1]  See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol. I. p. 426.\n\n[2]   For a number of maxims on this head, see \"Marshal Turenne\"\n(Longmans, 1907), p. 29.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                   VIII.  VARIATION IN TACTICS\n\n\n     [The heading means literally \"The Nine Variations,\" but as\nSun Tzu does not appear to enumerate these, and as,  indeed,  he\nhas already told us (V SS. 6-11) that such deflections from the\nordinary course are practically innumerable,  we have little\noption but to follow Wang Hsi, who says that \"Nine\" stands for an\nindefinitely large number.  \"All it means is that in warfare we\nought to vary our tactics to the utmost degree....  I do not know\nwhat Ts`ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out to be, but it has\nbeen suggested that they are connected with the Nine Situations\"\n- of chapt. XI.  This is the view adopted by Chang Yu.  The only\nother alternative is to suppose that something has been lost--a\nsupposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends\nsome weight.]\n\n     1.   Sun Tzu said:   In war,  the general receives his\ncommands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates\nhis forces.\n\n     [Repeated from VII. ss. 1, where it is certainly more in\nplace.  It may have been interpolated here merely in order to\nsupply a beginning to the chapter.]\n\n     2.  When in difficult country, do not encamp.  In country\nwhere high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.  Do not\nlinger in dangerously isolated positions.\n\n     [The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as\ngiven in the beginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on  (ibid.\nss. 43. q.v.).  Chang Yu defines this situation as being situated\nacross the frontier, in hostile territory.  Li Ch`uan says it is\n\"country in which there are no springs or wells, flocks or herds,\nvegetables or firewood;\" Chia Lin, \"one of gorges,  chasms and\nprecipices, without a road by which to advance.\"]\n\nIn hemmed-in situations,  you must resort to stratagem.  In\ndesperate position, you must fight.\n     3.  There are roads which must not be followed,\n\n     [\"Especially those leading through narrow defiles,\" says Li\nCh`uan, \"where an ambush is to be feared.\"]\n\narmies which must be not attacked,\n\n     [More correctly, perhaps, \"there are times when an army must\nnot be attacked.\"  Ch`en Hao says:  \"When you see your way to\nobtain a rival advantage, but are powerless to inflict a real\ndefeat, refrain from attacking, for fear of overtaxing your men's\nstrength.\"]\n\ntowns which must not be besieged,\n\n     [Cf.  III.  ss.  4   Ts`ao Kung gives   an   interesting\nillustration   from his own experience.  When invading   the\nterritory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the city of Hua-pi, which lay\ndirectly in his path, and pressed on into the heart of the\ncountry.  This excellent strategy was rewarded by the subsequent\ncapture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.\nChang Yu says:  \"No town should be attacked which,  if taken,\ncannot be held, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble.\"\nHsun Ying, when urged to attack Pi-yang, replied:  \"The city is\nsmall and well-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will\nbe no great feat of arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself\na laughing-stock.\"   In the seventeenth century,  sieges still\nformed a large proportion of war.  It was Turenne who directed\nattention to the importance of marches,  countermarches and\nmaneuvers.  He said:  \"It is a great mistake to waste men in\ntaking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a\nprovince.\" [1] ]\n\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign\nwhich must not be obeyed.\n\n     [This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence\nfor authority,  and Wei Liao Tzu (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to\nexclaim:    \"Weapons   are   baleful   instruments,   strife   is\nantagonistic to virtue, a military commander is the negation of\ncivil order!\"  The unpalatable fact remains, however, that even\nImperial wishes must be subordinated to military necessity.]\n\n     4.  The general who thoroughly understands the advantages\nthat accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his\ntroops.\n     5.  The general who does not understand these, may be well\nacquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not\nbe able to turn his knowledge to practical account.\n\n     [Literally,  \"get the advantage of the ground,\" which means\nnot only securing good positions, but availing oneself of natural\nadvantages in every possible way.  Chang Yu says:  \"Every kind of\nground is characterized by certain natural features,  and also\ngives scope for a certain variability of plan.  How it is\npossible to turn these natural features to account unless\ntopographical knowledge is supplemented by versatility of mind?\"]\n\n     6.  So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war\nof varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five\nAdvantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.\n\n     [Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and\ngenerally advantageous lines of action, namely:  \"if a certain\nroad is short, it must be followed; if an army is isolated,  it\nmust be attacked; if a town is in a parlous condition, it must be\nbesieged; if a position can be stormed, it must be attempted; and\nif consistent with military operations, the ruler's commands must\nbe obeyed.\"  But there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a\ngeneral to use these advantages.  For instance, \"a certain road\nmay be the shortest way for him, but if he knows that it abounds\nin natural obstacles, or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it,\nhe will not follow that road.  A hostile force may be open to\nattack,  but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to\nfight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\"  and so\non.]\n\n     7.  Hence in the wise leader's plans,  considerations of\nadvantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.\n\n     [\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous\none,\"  says Ts`ao Kung, \"the opposite state should be always\npresent to your mind.\"]\n\n     8.  If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way,\nwe may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our\nschemes.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the\nenemy, we must not fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the\npossibility of the enemy also doing some harm to us, and let this\nenter as a factor into our calculations.\"]\n\n     9.  If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we\nare always ready to seize an advantage,  we may extricate\nourselves from misfortune.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:   \"If I wish to extricate myself from a\ndangerous position, I must consider not only the enemy's ability\nto injure me, but also my own ability to gain an advantage over\nthe enemy.  If in my counsels these two considerations are\nproperly blended, I shall succeed in liberating myself....  For\ninstance;  if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think of\neffecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite\nmy adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to\nencourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the\nadvantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy's toils.\"\nSee the story of Ts`ao Ts`ao, VII. ss. 35, note.]\n\n     10.  Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;\n\n     [Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury,\nsome of which would only occur to the Oriental mind:--\"Entice\naway the enemy's best and wisest men, so that he may be left\nwithout counselors.  Introduce traitors into his country,  that\nthe government policy may be rendered futile.  Foment intrigue\nand deceit,  and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his\nministers.   By means of every artful   contrivance,   cause\ndeterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure.  Corrupt\nhis morals by insidious gifts leading him into excess.  Disturb\nand unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women.\"\nChang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of Sun\nTzu here:  \"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer\ninjury, and he will submit of his own accord.\"]\n\nand make trouble for them,\n\n     [Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that\ntrouble   should   be made for the   enemy   affecting   their\n\"possessions,\" or, as we might say, \"assets,\" which he considers\nto be  \"a large army, a rich exchequer,  harmony amongst the\nsoldiers,  punctual fulfillment of commands.\"  These give us a\nwhip-hand over the enemy.]\n\nand keep them constantly engaged;\n\n     [Literally,  \"make servants of them.\"  Tu Yu says  \"prevent\nthe from having any rest.\"]\n\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given\npoint.\n\n     [Meng Shih's note contains an excellent example of the\nidiomatic use of:  \"cause them to forget PIEN (the reasons for\nacting otherwise than on their first impulse), and hasten in our\ndirection.\"]\n\n     11.  The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood\nof the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive\nhim;  not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the\nfact that we have made our position unassailable.\n     12.  There are five dangerous faults which may affect a\ngeneral:  (1)  Recklessness, which leads to destruction;\n\n     [\"Bravery without forethought,\" as Ts`ao Kung analyzes it,\nwhich causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad\nbull.  Such an opponent, says Chang Yu, \"must not be encountered\nwith brute force, but may be lured into an ambush and slain.\"\nCf. Wu Tzu, chap. IV. ad init.:  \"In estimating the character of\na general,  men are wont to pay exclusive attention to his\ncourage,  forgetting that courage is only one out of many\nqualities which a general should possess.  The merely brave man\nis prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly,\nwithout any perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\"\nSsu-ma Fa, too, make the incisive remark:  \"Simply going to one's\ndeath does not bring about victory.\"]\n\n     (2)  cowardice, which leads to capture;\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as\n\"cowardice\"  as being of the man \"whom timidity prevents from\nadvancing to seize an advantage,\" and Wang Hsi adds \"who is quick\nto flee at the sight of danger.\"  Meng Shih gives the closer\nparaphrase \"he who is bent on returning alive,\" this is, the man\nwho will never take a risk.  But, as Sun Tzu knew, nothing is to\nbe achieved in war unless you are willing to take risks.  T`ai\nKung said:   \"He who lets an advantage slip will subsequently\nbring upon himself real disaster.\"  In 404 A.D., Liu Yu pursued\nthe rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle\nwith him at the island of Ch`eng-hung.  The loyal troops numbered\nonly a few thousands, while their opponents were in great force.\nBut Huan Hsuan,  fearing the fate which was in store for him\nshould be be overcome, had a light boat made fast to the side of\nhis war-junk,  so that he might escape,  if necessary,  at a\nmoment's notice.  The natural result was that the fighting spirit\nof his soldiers was utterly quenched, and when the loyalists made\nan attack from windward with fireships, all striving with the\nutmost ardor to be first in the fray, Huan Hsuan's forces were\nrouted,  had to burn all their baggage and fled for two days and\nnights without stopping.  Chang Yu tells a somewhat similar story\nof Chao Ying-ch`i,  a general of the Chin State who during a\nbattle with the army of Ch`u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in\nreadiness for him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be\nthe first to get across.]\n\n     (3)  a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n\n     [Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D.  by\nHuang Mei,  Teng Ch`iang and others shut himself up behind his\nwalls and refused to fight.  Teng Ch`iang said:  \"Our adversary\nis of a choleric temper and easily provoked; let us make constant\nsallies and break down his walls, then he will grow angry and\ncome out.  Once we can bring his force to battle, it is doomed to\nbe our prey.\"  This plan was acted upon, Yao Hsiang came out to\nfight,  was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy's pretended\nflight, and finally attacked and slain.]\n\n     (4)  a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;\n\n     [This need not be taken to mean that a sense of honor is\nreally a defect in a general.  What Sun Tzu condemns is rather an\nexaggerated sensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned\nman who is stung by opprobrium, however undeserved.  Mei Yao-\nch`en truly observes, though somewhat paradoxically:  \"The seek\nafter glory should be careless of public opinion.\"]\n\n     (5)  over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry\nand trouble.\n\n     [Here again, Sun Tzu does not mean that the general is to be\ncareless of the welfare of his troops.  All he wishes to\nemphasize is the danger of sacrificing any important military\nadvantage to the immediate comfort of his men.  This is a\nshortsighted policy,  because in the long run the troops will\nsuffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the prolongation of the\nwar,  which will be the consequence.  A mistaken feeling of pity\nwill often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered city, or to\nreinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his military\ninstincts.  It is now generally admitted that our repeated\nefforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so\nmany strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose.  And\nin the end, relief came through the very man who started out with\nthe distinct resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of\nthe whole to sentiment in favor of a part.  An old soldier of one\nof our generals who failed most conspicuously in this war,  tried\nonce,  I remember, to defend him to me on the ground that he was\nalways \"so good to his men.\"  By this plea, had he but known it,\nhe was only condemning him out of Sun Tzu's mouth.]\n\n     13.  These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous\nto the conduct of war.\n     14.  When an army is overthrown and its leader slain,  the\ncause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults.\nLet them be a subject of meditation.\n\n\n[1]  \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 50.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIX.  THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\n\n\n     [The contents of this interesting chapter are   better\nindicated in ss. 1 than by this heading.]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  We come now to the question of encamping\nthe army, and observing signs of the enemy.  Pass quickly over\nmountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys.\n\n     [The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands,  but to\nkeep close to supplies of water and grass.  Cf. Wu Tzu,  ch.  3:\n\"Abide not in natural ovens,\" i.e. \"the openings of valleys.\"\nChang Yu tells the following anecdote:  Wu-tu Ch`iang was a\nrobber captain in the time of the Later Han, and Ma Yuan was sent\nto exterminate his gang.  Ch`iang having found a refuge in the\nhills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but seized all\nthe favorable positions commanding supplies of water and forage.\nCh`iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of\nprovisions that he was forced to make a total surrender.  He did\nnot know the advantage of keeping in the neighborhood of\nvalleys.\"]\n\n     2.  Camp in high places,\n\n     [Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above\nthe surrounding country.]\n\nfacing the sun.\n\n     [Tu Mu takes this to mean \"facing south,\"  and Ch`en Hao\n\"facing east.\"  Cf.  infra, SS. 11, 13.\n\nDo not climb heights in order to fight.  So much for mountain\nwarfare.\n     3.  After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n\n     [\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according\nto Ts`ao Kung,  and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be\nimpeded in your evolutions.\"  The T`UNG TIEN reads, \"If THE ENEMY\ncrosses a river,\" etc.  But in view of the next sentence, this is\nalmost certainly an interpolation.]\n\n     4.  When an invading force crosses a river in its onward\nmarch, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream.  It will be best\nto let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over\nLung Chu at the Wei River.  Turning to the CH`IEN HAN SHU,  ch.\n34, fol. 6 verso, we find the battle described as follows:   \"The\ntwo armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the river.  In the\nnight,  Han Hsin ordered his men to take some ten thousand sacks\nfilled with sand and construct a dam higher up.  Then,  leading\nhalf his army across, he attacked Lung Chu; but after a time,\npretending to have failed in his attempt, he hastily withdrew to\nthe other bank.  Lung Chu was much elated by this unlooked-for\nsuccess, and exclaiming:  \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was really a\ncoward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his turn.\nHan Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags,  thus\nreleasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented\nthe greater portion of Lung Chu's army from getting across.  He\nthen turned upon the force which had been cut off,   and\nannihilated it, Lung Chu himself being amongst the slain.  The\nrest of the army, on the further bank, also scattered and fled in\nall directions.]\n\n     5.  If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet\nthe invader near a river which he has to cross.\n\n     [For fear of preventing his crossing.]\n\n     6.  Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the\nsun.\n\n     [See supra,  ss.  2.  The repetition of these words in\nconnection with water is very awkward.  Chang Yu has the note:\n\"Said either of troops marshaled on the river-bank, or of boats\nanchored in the stream itself; in either case it is essential to\nbe higher than the enemy and facing the sun.\"   The other\ncommentators are not at all explicit.]\n\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch\nour camp on the lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy\nshould open the sluices and sweep us away in a flood.  Chu-ko Wu-\nhou has remarked that 'in river warfare we must not advance\nagainst the stream,' which is as much as to say that our fleet\nmust not be anchored below that of the enemy, for then they would\nbe able to take advantage of the current and make short work of\nus.\"  There is also the danger, noted by other commentators, that\nthe enemy may throw poison on the water to be carried down to\nus.]\n\nSo much for river warfare.\n     7.  In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to\nget over them quickly, without any delay.\n\n     [Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the\nherbage, and last but not least, because they are low, flat,  and\nexposed to attack.]\n\n     8.  If forced to fight in a salt-marsh,  you should have\nwater and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be\ntreacherous where there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they\nwill serve to protect the rear.]\n\nSo much for operations in salt-marches.\n     9.  In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible\nposition with rising ground to your right and on your rear,\n\n     [Tu Mu quotes T`ai Kung as saying:  \"An army should have a\nstream or a marsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its\nright.\"]\n\nso that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind.  So\nmuch for campaigning in flat country.\n     10.  These are the four useful branches of   military\nknowledge\n\n     [Those,  namely, concerned with (1) mountains,  (2)  rivers,\n(3)  marshes,  and  (4)  plains.  Compare Napoleon's  \"Military\nMaxims,\" no. 1.]\n\nwhich enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several\nsovereigns.\n\n     [Regarding the \"Yellow Emperor\":  Mei Yao-ch`en asks,  with\nsome plausibility,  whether there is an error in the text as\nnothing is known of Huang Ti having conquered four other\nEmperors.  The SHIH CHI (ch. 1 ad init.) speaks only of his\nvictories over Yen Ti and Ch`ih Yu.  In the LIU T`AO it is\nmentioned that he  \"fought seventy battles and pacified the\nEmpire.\"   Ts`ao Kung's explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor\nwas the first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes,\neach of whom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of\nEmperor.  Li Ch`uan tells us that the art of war originated under\nHuang Ti, who received it from his Minister Feng Hou.]\n\n     11.  All armies prefer high ground to low.\n\n     [\"High Ground,\"  says Mei Yao-ch`en,  \"is not only more\nagreeable and salubrious, but more convenient from a military\npoint of view; low ground is not only damp and unhealthy,  but\nalso disadvantageous for fighting.\"]\n\nand sunny places to dark.\n     12.  If you are careful of your men,\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says:  \"Make for fresh water and pasture,  where\nyou can turn out your animals to graze.\"]\n\nand camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of\nevery kind,\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"The dryness of the climate will prevent\nthe outbreak of illness.\"]\n\nand this will spell victory.\n     13.  When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny\nside,  with the slope on your right rear.  Thus you will at once\nact for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural\nadvantages of the ground.\n     14.  When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river\nwhich you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must\nwait until it subsides.\n     15.  Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with\ntorrents running between, deep natural hollows,\n\n     [The latter defined as \"places enclosed on every side by\nsteep banks, with pools of water at the bottom.]\n\nconfined places,\n\n     [Defined as \"natural pens or prisons\" or \"places surrounded\nby precipices on three sides--easy to get into, but hard to get\nout of.\"]\n\ntangled thickets,\n\n     [Defined as \"places covered with such dense undergrowth that\nspears cannot be used.\"]\n\nquagmires\n\n     [Defined as \"low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be\nimpassable for chariots and horsemen.\"]\n\nand crevasses,\n\n     [Defined by Mei Yao-ch`en as \"a narrow difficult way between\nbeetling cliffs.\"  Tu Mu's note is \"ground covered with trees and\nrocks,  and intersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls.\"   This\nis very vague,  but Chia Lin explains it clearly enough as a\ndefile or narrow pass, and Chang Yu takes much the same view.  On\nthe whole, the weight of the commentators certainly inclines to\nthe rendering \"defile.\"  But the ordinary meaning of the Chinese\nin one place is \"a crack or fissure\" and the fact that the\nmeaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence indicates\nsomething in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun Tzu\nis here speaking of crevasses.]\n\nshould be left with all possible speed and not approached.\n     16.  While we keep away from such places, we should get the\nenemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the\nenemy have them on his rear.\n     17.  If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any\nhilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins\nfilled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be\ncarefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men\nin ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking.\n\n     [Chang Yu has the note:  \"We must also be on our guard\nagainst traitors who may lie in close covert, secretly spying out\nour weaknesses and overhearing our instructions.\"]\n\n     18.  When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet,  he\nis relying on the natural strength of his position.\n\n     [Here begin Sun Tzu's remarks on the reading of signs,  much\nof which is so good that it could almost be included in a modern\nmanual like Gen. Baden-Powell's \"Aids to Scouting.\"]\n\n     19.  When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle,  he\nis anxious for the other side to advance.\n\n     [Probably because we are in a strong position from which he\nwishes to dislodge us.  \"If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu,\n\"and tried to force a battle, he would seem to despise us,  and\nthere would be less probability of our responding to the\nchallenge.\"]\n\n     20.  If his place of encampment is easy of access,  he is\ntendering a bait.\n     21.  Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the\nenemy is advancing.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung explains this as \"felling trees to clear a\npassage,\"  and Chang Yu says:  \"Every man sends out scouts to\nclimb high places and observe the enemy.  If a scout sees that\nthe trees of a forest are moving and shaking, he may know that\nthey are being cut down to clear a passage for the enemy's\nmarch.\"]\n\nThe appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass\nmeans that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.\n\n     [Tu Yu's explanation, borrowed from Ts`ao Kung's,  is as\nfollows:   \"The presence of a number of screens or sheds in the\nmidst of thick vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled\nand,  fearing pursuit, has constructed these hiding-places in\norder to make us suspect an ambush.\"  It appears that these\n\"screens\"  were hastily knotted together out of any long grass\nwhich the retreating enemy happened to come across.]\n\n     22.  The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an\nambuscade.\n\n     [Chang Yu's explanation is doubtless right:   \"When birds\nthat are flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards,\nit means that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath.\"]\n\nStartled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.\n     23.  When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the\nsign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over\na wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry.\n\n     [\"High and sharp,\"  or rising to a peak,  is of course\nsomewhat exaggerated as applied to dust.  The commentators\nexplain the phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots,  being\nheavier than men, raise more dust, and also follow one another in\nthe same wheel-track, whereas foot-soldiers would be marching in\nranks,  many abreast.  According to Chang Yu, \"every army on the\nmarch must have scouts some way in advance, who on sighting dust\nraised by the enemy, will gallop back and report it to the\ncommander-in-chief.\"  Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell:  \"As you move along,\nsay,  in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar for\nthe enemy or any signs of him:  figures,  dust rising,  birds\ngetting up, glitter of arms, etc.\" [1] ]\n\nWhen it branches out in different directions,  it shows that\nparties have been sent to collect firewood.  A few clouds of dust\nmoving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:   \"In apportioning the defenses for a\ncantonment,  light horse will be sent out to survey the position\nand   ascertain the weak and strong points all along   its\ncircumference.  Hence the small quantity of dust and   its\nmotion.\"]\n\n     24.  Humble words and increased preparations are signs that\nthe enemy is about to advance.\n\n     [\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu.\n\"Their object is to make us contemptuous and careless,  after\nwhich they will attack us.\"  Chang Yu alludes to the story of\nT`ien Tan of the Ch`i-mo against the Yen forces,  led by Ch`i\nChieh.  In ch. 82 of the SHIH CHI we read:  \"T`ien Tan openly\nsaid:   'My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off the noses\nof their Ch`i prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight\nagainst us; that would be the undoing of our city.'   The other\nside being informed of this speech,  at once acted on the\nsuggestion;  but those within the city were enraged at seeing\ntheir fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest\nthey should fall into the enemy's hands, were nerved to defend\nthemselves more obstinately than ever.  Once again T`ien Tan sent\nback converted spies who reported these words to the enemy:\n\"What I dread most is that the men of Yen may dig up the\nancestral tombs outside the town,  and by inflicting   this\nindignity on our forefathers cause us to become faint-hearted.'\nForthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the\ncorpses lying in them.  And the inhabitants of Chi-mo, witnessing\nthe outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all\nimpatient to go out and fight,  their fury being increased\ntenfold.  T`ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for\nany enterprise.  But instead of a sword, he himself took a\nmattock in his hands, and ordered others to be distributed\namongst his best warriors, while the ranks were filled up with\ntheir wives and concubines.  He then served out all the remaining\nrations and bade his men eat their fill.  The regular soldiers\nwere told to keep out of sight, and the walls were manned with\nthe old and weaker men and with women.  This done,  envoys were\ndispatched to the enemy's camp to arrange terms of surrender,\nwhereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy.  T`ien Tan also\ncollected 20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the\nwealthy citizens of Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the\nprayer that,  when the town capitulated, he would allow their\nhomes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated.  Ch`i\nChieh, in high good humor, granted their prayer; but his army now\nbecame increasingly slack and careless.  Meanwhile, T`ien Tan got\ntogether a thousand oxen, decked them with pieces of red silk,\npainted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored stripes,  and\nfastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased rushes on\ntheir tails.  When night came on, he lighted the ends of the\nrushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had\npierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked\nwarriors.  The animals, maddened with pain,   dashed furiously\ninto the enemy's camp where they caused the utmost confusion and\ndismay; for their tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous\npattern on their bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or\nwounded any with whom they came into contact.  In the meantime,\nthe band of 5000 had crept up with gags in their mouths, and now\nthrew themselves on the enemy.  At the same moment a frightful\ndin arose in the city itself, all those that remained behind\nmaking as much noise as possible by banging drums and hammering\non bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed by the\nuproar.  Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder,  hotly\npursued by the men of Ch`i, who succeeded in slaying their\ngeneral Ch`i Chien....  The result of the battle was the ultimate\nrecovery of some seventy cities which had belonged to the Ch`i\nState.\"]\n\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are\nsigns that he will retreat.\n     25.  When the light chariots come out first and take up a\nposition on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for\nbattle.\n     26.  Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant\nindicate a plot.\n\n     [The reading here is uncertain.  Li Ch`uan indicates  \"a\ntreaty confirmed by oaths and hostages.\"  Wang Hsi and Chang Yu,\non the other hand, simply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous\npretext.\"]\n\n     27.  When there is much running about\n\n     [Every man hastening to his proper place under his own\nregimental banner.]\n\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical\nmoment has come.\n     28.  When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is\na lure.\n     29.  When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears,  they\nare faint from want of food.\n     30.  If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking\nthemselves, the army is suffering from thirst.\n\n     [As Tu Mu remarks:  \"One may know the condition of a whole\narmy from the behavior of a single man.\"]\n\n     31.  If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes\nno effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n     32.  If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n\n     [A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch`en\nHao says, the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\n\nClamor by night betokens nervousness.\n\n     33.  If there is disturbance in the camp,  the general's\nauthority is weak.  If the banners and flags are shifted about,\nsedition is afoot.  If the officers are angry, it means that the\nmen are weary.\n\n     [Tu Mu understands the sentence differently:  \"If all the\nofficers of an army are angry with their general, it means that\nthey are broken with fatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has\ndemanded from them.]\n\n     34.  When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its\ncattle for food,\n\n     [In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on\ngrain and the horses chiefly on grass.]\n\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-\nfires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may\nknow that they are determined to fight to the death.\n\n     [I may quote here the illustrative passage from the HOU HAN\nSHU,  ch. 71, given in abbreviated form by the P`EI WEN YUN FU:\n\"The rebel Wang Kuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch`en-\nts`ang,  and Huang-fu Sung, who was in supreme command, and Tung\nCho were sent out against him.  The latter pressed for hasty\nmeasures, but Sung turned a deaf ear to his counsel.  At last the\nrebels were utterly worn out, and began to throw down their\nweapons of their own accord.  Sung was not advancing to the\nattack,  but Cho said:  'It is a principle of war not to pursue\ndesperate men and not to press a retreating host.'   Sung\nanswered:  'That does not apply here.  What I am about to attack\nis a jaded army, not a retreating host; with disciplined troops I\nam falling on a disorganized multitude, not a band of desperate\nmen.'   Thereupon he advances to the attack unsupported by his\ncolleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo being slain.\"]\n\n     35.  The sight of men whispering together in small knots or\nspeaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank\nand file.\n     36.  Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the\nend of his resources;\n\n     [Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there\nis always a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep\nthe men in good temper.]\n\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\n\n     [Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed,  and\nunwonted severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty.]\n\n     37.  To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at\nthe enemy's numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n\n     [I follow the interpretation of Ts`ao Kung, also adopted by\nLi Ch`uan,  Tu Mu, and Chang Yu.  Another possible meaning set\nforth by Tu Yu, Chia Lin, Mei Tao-ch`en and Wang Hsi, is:   \"The\ngeneral who is first tyrannical towards his men,  and then in\nterror lest they should mutiny, etc.\"  This would connect the\nsentence with what went before about rewards and punishments.]\n\n     38.  When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths,\nit is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:   \"If the enemy open friendly relations be\nsending hostages,  it is a sign that they are anxious for an\narmistice, either because their strength is exhausted or for some\nother reason.\"   But it hardly needs a Sun Tzu to draw such an\nobvious inference.]\n\n     39.  If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain\nfacing ours for a long time without either joining battle or\ntaking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands\ngreat vigilance and circumspection.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says a maneuver of this sort may be only a ruse\nto gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an\nambush.]\n\n     40.  If our troops are no more in number than the enemy,\nthat is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can\nbe made.\n\n     [Literally,  \"no martial advance.\"  That is to say,  CHENG\ntactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed,  and stratagem\nresorted to instead.]\n\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available\nstrength,   keep a close watch on the enemy,   and   obtain\nreinforcements.\n\n     [This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators\nsucceed in squeezing very good sense out of it.  I follow Li\nCh`uan, who appears to offer the simplest explanation:  \"Only the\nside that gets more men will win.\"  Fortunately we have Chang Yu\nto expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity\nitself:   \"When the numbers are even, and no favorable opening\npresents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver\na sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our\nsutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces\nand keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the\nvictory.  But we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help\nus.\"   He then quotes from Wei Liao Tzu, ch.  3:   \"The nominal\nstrength of mercenary troops may be 100,000, but their real value\nwill be not more than half that figure.\"]\n\n     41.  He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his\nopponents is sure to be captured by them.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao, quoting from the TSO CHUAN, says:  \"If bees and\nscorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state!  Even\na puny opponent, then, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\n\n     42.  If soldiers are punished before they have grown\nattached to you, they will not prove submissive;  and,  unless\nsubmissive,  then will be practically useless.  If,  when the\nsoldiers have become attached to you,  punishments are not\nenforced, they will still be useless.\n     43.  Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first\ninstance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron\ndiscipline.\n\n     [Yen Tzu  [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu:   \"His civil\nvirtues endeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his\nenemies in awe.\"  Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. 4 init.:  \"The ideal commander\nunites culture with a warlike temper; the profession of arms\nrequires a combination of hardness and tenderness.\"]\n\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n\n     44.  If in training soldiers commands are   habitually\nenforced,  the army will be well-disciplined;  if not,   its\ndiscipline will be bad.\n     45.  If a general shows confidence in his men but always\ninsists on his orders being obeyed,\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"A general ought in time of peace to show\nkindly confidence in his men and also make his authority\nrespected,  so that when they come to face the enemy, orders may\nbe executed and discipline maintained, because they all trust and\nlook up to him.\"  What Sun Tzu has said in ss. 44, however, would\nlead one rather to expect something like this:  \"If a general is\nalways confident that his orders will be carried out,\" etc.\"]\n\nthe gain will be mutual.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"The general has confidence in the men\nunder his command, and the men are docile, having confidence in\nhim.  Thus the gain is mutual\"  He quotes a pregnant sentence\nfrom Wei Liao Tzu, ch. 4:  \"The art of giving orders is not to\ntry to rectify minor blunders and not to be swayed by petty\ndoubts.\"   Vacillation and fussiness are the surest means of\nsapping the confidence of an army.]\n\n\n[1]  \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nX.  TERRAIN\n\n\n     [Only about a third of the chapter, comprising ss. ss. 1-13,\ndeals with \"terrain,\" the subject being more fully treated in ch.\nXI.  The  \"six calamities\" are discussed in SS. 14-20,  and the\nrest of the chapter is again a mere string of desultory remarks,\nthough not less interesting, perhaps, on that account.]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  We may distinguish six kinds of terrain,\nto wit:  (1)  Accessible ground;\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"plentifully provided with roads and\nmeans of communications.\"]\n\n(2)  entangling ground;\n\n     [The same commentator says:  \"Net-like country,  venturing\ninto which you become entangled.\"]\n\n(3)  temporizing ground;\n\n     [Ground which allows you to \"stave off\" or \"delay.\"]\n\n(4)  narrow passes; (5)  precipitous heights; (6) positions at a\ngreat distance from the enemy.\n\n     [It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this\nclassification.  A strange lack of logical perception is shown in\nthe   Chinaman's unquestioning acceptance of glaring   cross-\ndivisions such as the above.]\n\n     2.  Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is\ncalled ACCESSIBLE.\n     3.  With regard to ground of this nature,  be before the\nenemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots,  and carefully\nguard your line of supplies.\n\n     [The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly,  as\nTu Yu says, \"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\"\nIn view of Napoleon's dictum, \"the secret of war lies in the\ncommunications,\"  [1]  we could wish that Sun Tzu had done more\nthan skirt the edge of this important subject here and in I.  ss.\n10,  VII. ss. 11.  Col. Henderson says:  \"The line of supply may\nbe said to be as vital to the existence of an army as the heart\nto the life of a human being.  Just as the duelist who finds his\nadversary's point menacing him with certain death, and his own\nguard astray,  is compelled to conform to his   adversary's\nmovements,  and to content himself with warding off his thrusts,\nso the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened\nfinds himself in a false position, and he will be fortunate if he\nhas not to change all his plans, to split up his force into more\nor less isolated detachments, and to fight with inferior numbers\non ground which he has not had time to prepare, and where defeat\nwill not be an ordinary failure, but will entail the ruin or\nsurrender of his whole army.\" [2]\n\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\n     4.  Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy\nis called ENTANGLING.\n     5.  From a position of this sort,  if the enemy   is\nunprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him.  But if the enemy\nis prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him,  then,\nreturn being impossible, disaster will ensue.\n     6.  When the position is such that neither side will gain by\nmaking the first move, it is called TEMPORIZING ground.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"Each side finds it inconvenient to move,  and\nthe situation remains at a deadlock.\"]\n\n     7.  In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should\noffer us an attractive bait,\n\n     [Tu Yu says, \"turning their backs on us and pretending to\nflee.\"   But this is only one of the lures which might induce us\nto quit our position.]\n\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat,\nthus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army\nhas come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n     8.  With regard to NARROW PASSES, if you can occupy them\nfirst,  let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of\nthe enemy.\n\n     [Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \"the initiative will lie\nwith us,  and by making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall\nhave the enemy at our mercy.\"]\n\n     9.  Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass,  do\nnot go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it\nis weakly garrisoned.\n     10.  With regard to PRECIPITOUS HEIGHTS,  if you   are\nbeforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and\nsunny spots, and there wait for him to come up.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says:  \"The particular advantage of securing\nheights and defiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated\nby the enemy.\"   [For the enunciation of the grand principle\nalluded to,  see VI.  ss. 2].  Chang Yu tells the following\nanecdote of P`ei Hsing-chien (A.D. 619-682), who was sent on a\npunitive expedition against the Turkic tribes.  \"At night he\npitched his camp as usual, and it had already been completely\nfortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders that\nthe army should shift its quarters to a hill near by.  This was\nhighly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against\nthe extra fatigue which it would entail on the men.  P`ei Hsing-\nchien,  however, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the\ncamp moved as quickly as possible.  The same night,  a terrific\nstorm came on, which flooded their former place of encampment to\nthe depth of over twelve feet.  The recalcitrant officers were\namazed at the sight, and owned that they had been in the wrong.\n'How did you know what was going to happen?' they asked.  P`ei\nHsing-chien replied:  'From this time forward be content to obey\norders without asking unnecessary questions.'  From this it may\nbe seen,\"  Chang Yu continues, \"that high and sunny places are\nadvantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are\nimmune from disastrous floods.\"]\n\n     11.  If the enemy has occupied them before you,  do not\nfollow him, but retreat and try to entice him away.\n\n     [The turning point of Li Shih-min's campaign in 621 A.D.\nagainst the two rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia,  and Wang\nShih-ch`ung,  Prince of Cheng, was his seizure of the heights of\nWu-lao,  in spite of which Tou Chien-te persisted in his attempt\nto relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was defeated and taken prisoner.\nSee CHIU T`ANG, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso, and also ch. 54.]\n\n     12.  If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy,\nand the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to\nprovoke a battle,\n\n     [The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long\nand wearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says,  \"we\nshould be exhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\"]\n\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n\n     13.  These six are the principles connected with Earth.\n\n     [Or perhaps,  \"the principles relating to ground.\"   See,\nhowever, I. ss. 8.]\n\nThe general who has attained a responsible post must be careful\nto study them.\n     14.  Now an army is exposed to six several calamities,  not\narising from natural causes, but from faults for which the\ngeneral   is   responsible.   These are:    (1)   Flight;   (2)\ninsubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganization; (6)\nrout.\n     15.  Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled\nagainst another ten times its size, the result will be the FLIGHT\nof the former.\n     16.  When the common soldiers are too strong and their\nofficers too weak, the result is INSUBORDINATION.\n\n     [Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T`ien Pu [HSIN T`ANG SHU,\nch. 148], who was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an\narmy against Wang T`ing-ts`ou.  But the whole time he was in\ncommand,  his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt,  and\nopenly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys,\nseveral thousands at a time.  T`ien Pu was powerless to put a\nstop to this conduct, and when, after some months had passed,  he\nmade an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops turned tail and\ndispersed in every direction.  After that, the unfortunate man\ncommitted suicide by cutting his throat.]\n\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too\nweak, the result is COLLAPSE.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says:  \"The officers are energetic and want to\npress on, the common soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\"]\n\n     17.  When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate,\nand on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a\nfeeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell\nwhether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is RUIN.\n\n     [Wang Hsi`s note is:  \"This means, the general is angry\nwithout cause,  and at the same time does not appreciate the\nability of his subordinate officers; thus he arouses fierce\nresentment and brings an avalanche of ruin upon his head.\"]\n\n     18.  When the general is weak and without authority;  when\nhis orders are not clear and distinct;\n\n     [Wei Liao Tzu (ch. 4) says:  \"If the commander gives his\norders with decision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them\ntwice;  if his moves are made without vacillation,  the soldiers\nwill not be in two minds about doing their duty.\"  General Baden-\nPowell says,  italicizing the words:  \"The secret of getting\nsuccessful work out of your trained men lies in one nutshell--in\nthe clearness of the instructions they receive.\"  [3]  Cf.  also\nWu Tzu ch. 3:  \"the most fatal defect in a military leader is\ndifference;  the worst calamities that befall an army arise from\nhesitation.\"]\n\nwhen there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men,\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"Neither officers nor men have any regular\nroutine.\"]\n\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner,  the\nresult is utter DISORGANIZATION.\n     19.  When a general,  unable to estimate the   enemy's\nstrength,  allows an inferior force to engage a larger one,  or\nhurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to\nplace picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be ROUT.\n\n     [Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and\ncontinues:   \"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest\nspirits should be appointed to serve in the front ranks, both in\norder to strengthen the resolution of our own men and to\ndemoralize the enemy.\"  Cf. the primi ordines of Caesar  (\"De\nBello Gallico,\" V. 28, 44, et al.).]\n\n     20.  These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be\ncarefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible\npost.\n\n     [See supra, ss. 13.]\n\n     21.  The natural formation of the country is the soldier's\nbest ally;\n\n     [Ch`en Hao says:  \"The advantages of weather and season are\nnot equal to those connected with ground.\"]\n\nbut a power of estimating the adversary,  of controlling the\nforces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties,\ndangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.\n     22.  He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his\nknowledge into practice, will win his battles.  He who knows them\nnot, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.\n     23.  If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must\nfight,  even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not\nresult in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler's\nbidding.\n\n     [Cf. VIII. ss. 3 fin.  Huang Shih-kung of the Ch`in dynasty,\nwho is said to have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have\nwritten the SAN LUEH, has these words attributed to him:   \"The\nresponsibility of setting an army in motion must devolve on the\ngeneral alone;  if advance and retreat are controlled from the\nPalace,  brilliant results will hardly be achieved.  Hence the\ngod-like ruler and the enlightened monarch are content to play a\nhumble part in furthering their country's cause [lit., kneel down\nto push the chariot wheel].\"  This means that \"in matters lying\noutside the zenana, the decision of the military commander must\nbe absolute.\"  Chang Yu also quote the saying:  \"Decrees from the\nSon of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\n     24.  The general who advances without coveting fame and\nretreats without fearing disgrace,\n\n     [It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing\nof all for a soldier is to retreat.]\n\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service\nfor his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n\n     [A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese  \"happy\nwarrior.\"   Such a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer\npunishment, would not regret his conduct.\"]\n\n     25.  Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will\nfollow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own\nbeloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.\n\n     [Cf.  I. ss. 6.  In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an\nengaging picture of the famous general Wu Ch`i,  from whose\ntreatise on war I have frequently had occasion to quote:   \"He\nwore the same clothes and ate the same food as the meanest of his\nsoldiers,  refused to have either a horse to ride or a mat to\nsleep on, carried his own surplus rations wrapped in a parcel,\nand shared every hardship with his men.  One of his soldiers was\nsuffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch`i himself sucked out the\nvirus.  The soldier's mother, hearing this, began wailing and\nlamenting.  Somebody asked her, saying:  'Why do you cry?   Your\nson is only a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief\nhimself has sucked the poison from his sore.'  The woman replied,\n'Many years ago,  Lord Wu performed a similar service for my\nhusband, who never left him afterwards, and finally met his death\nat the hands of the enemy.  And now that he has done the same for\nmy son, he too will fall fighting I know not where.'\"  Li Ch`uan\nmentions the Viscount of Ch`u, who invaded the small state of\nHsiao during the winter.  The Duke of Shen said to him:  \"Many of\nthe soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\"  So he made a\nround of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men;  and\nstraightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined\nwith floss silk.]\n\n     26.  If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your\nauthority   felt;  kind-hearted,  but unable to enforce   your\ncommands;  and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder:   then\nyour soldiers must be likened to spoilt children;  they are\nuseless for any practical purpose.\n\n     [Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers\nafraid of you, they would not be afraid of the enemy.  Tu Mu\nrecalls an instance of stern military discipline which occurred\nin 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was occupying the town of Chiang-ling.\nHe had given stringent orders to his army not to molest the\ninhabitants nor take anything from them by force.  Nevertheless,\na certain officer serving under his banner, who happened to be a\nfellow-townsman,  ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat belonging\nto one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation\nhelmet as a protection against the rain.  Lu Meng considered that\nthe fact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be\nallowed to palliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly\nhe ordered his summary execution, the tears rolling down his\nface,  however,  as he did so.  This act of severity filled the\narmy with wholesome awe, and from that time forth even articles\ndropped in the highway were not picked up.]\n\n     27.  If we know that our own men are in a condition to\nattack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack,  we\nhave gone only halfway towards victory.\n\n     [That is,  Ts`ao Kung says, \"the issue in this case is\nuncertain.\"]\n\n     28.  If we know that the enemy is open to attack,  but are\nunaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack,  we\nhave gone only halfway towards victory.\n\n     [Cf. III. ss. 13 (1).]\n\n     29.  If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also\nknow that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware\nthat the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable,  we\nhave still gone only halfway towards victory.\n     30.  Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never\nbewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\n\n     [The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his\nmeasures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand.  \"He does\nnot move recklessly,\" says Chang Yu, \"so that when he does move,\nhe makes no mistakes.\"]\n\n     31.  Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know\nyourself,  your victory will not stand in doubt;  if you know\nHeaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan sums up as follows:  \"Given a knowledge of three\nthings--the affairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural\nadvantages of earth--,  victory will invariably crown   your\nbattles.\"]\n\n\n[1]  See \"Pensees de Napoleon 1er,\" no. 47.\n\n[2]  \"The Science of War,\" chap. 2.\n\n[3]  \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. xii.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXI.  THE NINE SITUATIONS\n\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  The art of war recognizes nine varieties\nof ground:   (1)  Dispersive ground;  (2)  facile ground;  (3)\ncontentious ground; (4) open ground; (5) ground of intersecting\nhighways; (6) serious ground; (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in\nground; (9) desperate ground.\n     2.  When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is\ndispersive ground.\n\n     [So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes\nand anxious to see their wives and children, are likely to seize\nthe opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every\ndirection.  \"In their advance,\" observes Tu Mu, \"they will lack\nthe valor of desperation, and when they retreat, they will find\nharbors of refuge.\"]\n\n     3.  When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no\ngreat distance, it is facile ground.\n\n     [Li Ch`uan and Ho Shih say \"because of the facility for\nretreating,\"   and   the   other   commentators   give    similar\nexplanations.  Tu Mu remarks:  \"When your army has crossed the\nborder, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make\nit clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home.\"]\n\n     4.  Ground the possession of which imports great advantage\nto either side, is contentious ground.\n\n     [Tu Mu defines the ground as ground \"to be contended for.\"\nTs`ao Kung says:   \"ground on which the few and the weak can\ndefeat the many and the strong,\" such as \"the neck of a pass,\"\ninstanced   by Li Ch`uan.  Thus,  Thermopylae was   of   this\nclassification because the possession of it, even for a few days\nonly,  meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus\ngaining invaluable time.  Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. V.  ad init.:   \"For\nthose who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten,  there is\nnothing better than a narrow pass.\"  When Lu Kuang was returning\nfrom his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had\ngot as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi,  administrator\nof Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of\nCh`in,  plotted against him and was for barring his way into the\nprovince.  Yang Han,  governor of Kao-ch`ang,  counseled him,\nsaying:   \"Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west,  and\nhis soldiers are vigorous and mettlesome.  If we oppose him in\nthe shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him,\nand we must therefore try a different plan.  Let us hasten to\noccupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting\nhim off from supplies of water,  and when his troops are\nprostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without\nmoving.  Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off,\nwe could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass,  which is\nnearer.  The cunning and resource of Tzu-fang himself would be\nexpended in vain against the enormous strength of these two\npositions.\"   Liang Hsi,  refusing to act on this advice,  was\noverwhelmed and swept away by the invader.]\n\n     5.  Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is\nopen ground.\n\n     [There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective\nfor this type of ground.  Ts`ao Kung says it means   \"ground\ncovered with a network of roads,\" like a chessboard.  Ho Shih\nsuggested:  \"ground on which intercommunication is easy.\"]\n\n     6.  Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,\n\n     [Ts`au Kung defines this as:  \"Our country adjoining the\nenemy's and a third country conterminous with both.\"  Meng Shih\ninstances the small principality of Cheng, which was bounded on\nthe north-east by Ch`i, on the west by Chin, and on the south by\nCh`u.]\n\nso that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his\ncommand,\n\n     [The belligerent who holds this dominating position can\nconstrain most of them to become his allies.]\n\nis a ground of intersecting highways.\n     7.  When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile\ncountry, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is\nserious ground.\n\n     [Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that \"when an army has\nreached such a point, its situation is serious.\"]\n\n     8.  Mountain forests,\n\n     [Or simply \"forests.\"]\n\nrugged steeps,  marshes and fens--all country that is hard to\ntraverse:  this is difficult ground.\n     9.  Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from\nwhich we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small\nnumber of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our\nmen:  this is hemmed in ground.\n     10.  Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction\nby fighting without delay, is desperate ground.\n\n     [The situation, as pictured by Ts`ao Kung, is very similar\nto the \"hemmed-in ground\" except that here escape is no longer\npossible:   \"A lofty mountain in front, a large river behind,\nadvance impossible, retreat blocked.\"  Ch`en Hao says:  \"to be on\n'desperate ground' is like sitting in a leaking boat or crouching\nin a burning house.\"   Tu Mu quotes from Li Ching a vivid\ndescription of the plight of an army thus entrapped:  \"Suppose an\narmy invading hostile territory without the aid of local guides:\n--  it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy's mercy.  A\nravine on the left,  a mountain on the right,  a pathway so\nperilous that the horses have to be roped together and the\nchariots carried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut\noff behind,  no choice but to proceed in single file.  Then,\nbefore there is time to range our soldiers in order of battle,\nthe enemy is overwhelming strength suddenly appears on the scene.\nAdvancing, we can nowhere take a breathing-space; retreating,  we\nhave no haven of refuge.  We seek a pitched battle, but in vain;\nyet standing on the defensive, none of us has a moment's respite.\nIf we simply maintain our ground, whole days and months will\ncrawl by;  the moment we make a move, we have to sustain the\nenemy's attacks on front and rear.  The country is wild,\ndestitute of water and plants; the army is lacking in the\nnecessaries of life, the horses are jaded and the men worn-out,\nall the resources of strength and skill unavailing, the pass so\nnarrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten\nthousand;  all means of offense in the hands of the enemy,  all\npoints of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:--in this\nterrible plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and\nthe keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the\nslightest effect?\"  Students of Greek history may be reminded of\nthe awful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the\nAthenians under Nicias and Demonsthenes.  [See Thucydides,  VII.\n78 sqq.].]\n\n     11.  On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not.  On facile\nground, halt not.  On contentious ground, attack not.\n\n     [But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the\nadvantageous position first.  So Ts`ao Kung.  Li Ch`uan and\nothers,  however,  suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has\nalready forestalled us, sot that it would be sheer madness to\nattack.  In the SUN TZU HSU LU, when the King of Wu inquires what\nshould be done in this case, Sun Tzu replies:  \"The rule with\nregard to contentious ground is that those in possession have the\nadvantage over the other side.  If a position of this kind is\nsecured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him.  Lure him\naway by pretending to flee--show your banners and sound your\ndrums--make a dash for other places that he cannot afford to\nlose--trail brushwood and raise a dust--confound his ears and\neyes--detach a body of your best troops, and place it secretly in\nambuscade.  Then your opponent will sally forth to the rescue.\"]\n\n     12.  On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.\n\n     [Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the\nblocking   force itself to serious risks.  There   are   two\ninterpretations available here.  I follow that of Chang Yu.  The\nother is indicated in Ts`ao Kung's brief note:   \"Draw closer\ntogether\"--i.e.,  see that a portion of your own army is not cut\noff.]\n\nOn the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your\nallies.\n\n     [Or perhaps, \"form alliances with neighboring states.\"]\n\n     13.  On serious ground, gather in plunder.\n\n     [On this, Li Ch`uan has the following delicious note:  \"When\nan army penetrates far into the enemy's country, care must be\ntaken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment.  Follow the\nexample of the Han Emperor Kao Tsu,  whose march into Ch`in\nterritory was marked by no violation of women or looting of\nvaluables.  [Nota bene:  this was in 207 B.C., and may well cause\nus to blush for the Christian armies that entered Peking in 1900\nA.D.]   Thus he won the hearts of all.  In the present passage,\nthen,  I think that the true reading must be, not 'plunder,'  but\n'do not plunder.'\"  Alas, I fear that in this instance the worthy\ncommentator's feelings outran his judgment.  Tu Mu, at least, has\nno such illusions.  He says:  \"When encamped on 'serious ground,'\nthere being no inducement as yet to advance further,  and no\npossibility of retreat,  one ought to take measures for a\nprotracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides,\nand keep a close watch on the enemy.\"]\n\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\n\n     [Or, in the words of VIII. ss. 2, \"do not encamp.]\n\n     14.  On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.\n\n     [Ts`au   Kung says:   \"Try the effect of some   unusual\nartifice;\"  and Tu Yu amplifies this by saying:   \"In such a\nposition,  some scheme must be devised which will suit the\ncircumstances,  and if we can succeed in deluding the enemy,  the\nperil may be escaped.\"  This is exactly what happened on the\nfamous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the mountains\non the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by the\ndictator Fabius.  The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle\nhis foes was remarkably like that which T`ien Tan had also\nemployed with success exactly 62 years before.  [See IX. ss.  24,\nnote.]  When night came on, bundles of twigs were fastened to the\nhorns of some 2000 oxen and set on fire, the terrified animals\nbeing then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the\npasses which were beset by the enemy.  The strange spectacle of\nthese rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the Romans\nthat they withdrew from their position,  and Hannibal's army\npassed safely through the defile.  [See Polybius, III.  93,  94;\nLivy, XXII. 16 17.]\n\nOn desperate ground, fight.\n\n     [For,  as Chia Lin remarks:  \"if you fight with all your\nmight,  there is a chance of life; where as death is certain if\nyou cling to your corner.\"]\n\n     15.  Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how\nto drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear;\n\n     [More literally,  \"cause the front and rear to lose touch\nwith each other.\"]\n\nto prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to\nhinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from\nrallying their men.\n     16.  When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep\nthem in disorder.\n     17.  When it was to their advantage, they made a forward\nmove; when otherwise, they stopped still.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en connects this with the foregoing:   \"Having\nsucceeded in thus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward\nin order to secure any advantage to be gained; if there was no\nadvantage to be gained, they would remain where they were.\"]\n\n     18.  If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in\norderly array and on the point of marching to the attack,  I\nshould say:   \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent\nholds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\"\n\n     [Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzu had in mind.  Ts`ao Kung\nthinks it is \"some strategical advantage on which the enemy is\ndepending.\"   Tu Mu says:  \"The three things which an enemy is\nanxious to do, and on the accomplishment of which his success\ndepends,  are:   (1) to capture our favorable positions;  (2)  to\nravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard his own communications.\"\nOur object then must be to thwart his plans in these three\ndirections and thus render him helpless.  [Cf. III. ss. 3.]   By\nboldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the\nother side on the defensive.]\n\n     19.  Rapidity is the essence of war:\n\n     [According to Tu Mu,  \"this is a summary of   leading\nprinciples in warfare,\" and he adds:  \"These are the profoundest\ntruths of military science,  and the chief business of the\ngeneral.\"   The following anecdotes, told by Ho Shih,  shows the\nimportance attached to speed by two of China's greatest generals.\nIn 227 A.D.,  Meng Ta, governor of Hsin-ch`eng under the Wei\nEmperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to the House of Shu, and\nhad entered into correspondence with Chu-ko Liang, Prime Minister\nof that State.  The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then military\ngovernor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta's treachery, he at\nonce set off with an army to anticipate his revolt,  having\npreviously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.\nSsu-ma's officers came to him and said:  \"If Meng Ta has leagued\nhimself with Wu and Shu,  the matter should be thoroughly\ninvestigated before we make a move.\"  Ssu-ma I replied:  \"Meng Ta\nis an unprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at\nonce, while he is still wavering and before he has thrown off the\nmask.\"  Then, by a series of forced marches, be brought his army\nunder the walls of Hsin-ch`eng with in a space of eight days.\nNow Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to Chu-ko Liang:\n\"Wan is 1200 LI from here.  When the news of my revolt reaches\nSsu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it will\nbe a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time\nmy city will be well fortified.  Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to\ncome himself, and the generals that will be sent against us are\nnot worth troubling about.\"  The next letter, however, was filled\nwith consternation:  \"Though only eight days have passed since I\nthrew off my allegiance, an army is already at the city-gates.\nWhat miraculous rapidity is this!\"  A fortnight later,  Hsin-\nch`eng had fallen and Meng Ta had lost his head.   [See\nCHIN SHU,  ch. 1, f. 3.]  In 621 A.D., Li Ching was sent from\nK`uei-chou in Ssu-ch`uan to reduce the successful rebel Hsiao\nHsien,  who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou Fu in\nHupeh.  It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood,\nHsiao Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come\ndown through the gorges, and consequently made no preparations.\nBut Li Ching embarked his army without loss of time, and was just\nabout to start when the other generals implored him to postpone\nhis departure until the river was in a less dangerous state for\nnavigation.  Li Ching replied:  \"To the soldier,  overwhelming\nspeed is of paramount importance,  and he must never miss\nopportunities.  Now is the time to strike, before Hsiao Hsien\neven knows that we have got an army together.  If we seize the\npresent moment when the river is in flood, we shall appear before\nhis capital with startling suddenness, like the thunder which is\nheard before you have time to stop your ears against it.  [See\nVII. ss. 19, note.]  This is the great principle in war.  Even if\nhe gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his\nsoldiers in such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us.\nThus the full fruits of victory will be ours.\"  All came about as\nhe predicted,  and Hsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender,  nobly\nstipulating that his people should be spared and he alone suffer\nthe penalty of death.]\n\ntake advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by\nunexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.\n     20.  The following are the principles to be observed by an\ninvading force:  The further you penetrate into a country,  the\ngreater will be the solidarity of your troops,  and thus the\ndefenders will not prevail against you.\n     21.  Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your\narmy with food.\n\n     [Cf.  supra, ss. 13.  Li Ch`uan does not venture on a note\nhere.]\n\n     22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,\n\n     [For  \"well-being\", Wang Hsi means, \"Pet them,  humor them,\ngive them plenty of food and drink,  and look after them\ngenerally.\"]\n\nand do not overtax them.  Concentrate your energy and hoard your\nstrength.\n\n     [Ch`en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the\nfamous   general Wang Chien,  whose military genius   largely\ncontributed to the success of the First Emperor.  He had invaded\nthe Ch`u State, where a universal levy was made to oppose him.\nBut, being doubtful of the temper of his troops, he declined all\ninvitations to fight and remained strictly on the defensive.  In\nvain did the Ch`u general try to force a battle:  day after day\nWang Chien kept inside his walls and would not come out,  but\ndevoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and\nconfidence of his men.  He took care that they should be well\nfed,  sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for\nbathing,  and employed every method of judicious indulgence to\nweld them into a loyal and homogenous body.  After some time had\nelapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were\namusing themselves.  The answer was, that they were contending\nwith one another in putting the weight and long-jumping.  When\nWang Chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic\npursuits,  he knew that their spirits had been strung up to the\nrequired pitch and that they were now ready for fighting.  By\nthis time the Ch`u army, after repeating their challenge again\nand again,  had marched away eastwards in disgust.  The Ch`in\ngeneral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in\nthe battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter.\nShortly afterwards, the whole of Ch`u was conquered by Ch`in, and\nthe king Fu-ch`u led into captivity.]\n\nKeep your army continually on the move,\n\n     [In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you\nare.  It has struck me, however, that the true reading might be\n\"link your army together.\"]\n\nand devise unfathomable plans.\n     23.  Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no\nescape, and they will prefer death to flight.  If they will face\ndeath, there is nothing they may not achieve.\n\n     [Chang Yu quotes his favorite Wei Liao Tzu (ch. 3):  \"If one\nman were to run amok with a sword in the market-place,  and\neverybody else tried to get our of his way, I should not allow\nthat this man alone had courage and that all the rest were\ncontemptible cowards.  The truth is, that a desperado and a man\nwho sets some value on his life do not meet on even terms.\"]\n\nOfficers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"If they are in an awkward place together,\nthey will surely exert their united strength to get out of it.\"]\n\n     24.  Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of\nfear.  If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm.  If\nthey are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front.  If\nthere is no help for it, they will fight hard.\n     25.  Thus,  without waiting to be marshaled,  the soldiers\nwill be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked,\nthey will do your will;\n\n     [Literally, \"without asking, you will get.\"]\n\nwithout restrictions,  they will be faithful;  without giving\norders, they can be trusted.\n     26.  Prohibit the taking of omens,  and do away with\nsuperstitious doubts.  Then,  until death itself comes,   no\ncalamity need be feared.\n\n     [The superstitious, \"bound in to saucy doubts and fears,\"\ndegenerate into cowards and \"die many times before their deaths.\"\nTu Mu quotes Huang Shih-kung:  \"'Spells and incantations should\nbe strictly forbidden,  and no officer allowed to inquire by\ndivination into the fortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers'\nminds should be seriously perturbed.'   The meaning is,\"  he\ncontinues,  \"that if all doubts and scruples are discarded,  your\nmen will never falter in their resolution until they die.\"]\n\n     27.  If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is\nnot because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are\nnot unduly long,  it is not because they are disinclined to\nlongevity.\n\n     [Chang Yu has the best note on this passage:   \"Wealth and\nlong   life are things for which all men have a   natural\ninclination.  Hence, if they burn or fling away valuables,  and\nsacrifice their own lives, it is not that they dislike them,  but\nsimply that they have no choice.\"  Sun Tzu is slyly insinuating\nthat,  as soldiers are but human, it is for the general to see\nthat temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not thrown\nin their way.]\n\n     28.  On the day they are ordered out to battle,  your\nsoldiers may weep,\n\n     [The word in the Chinese is \"snivel.\"  This is taken to\nindicate more genuine grief than tears alone.]\n\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down\nletting the tears run down their cheeks.\n\n     [Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts`ao Kung\nsays,  \"all have embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\"   We\nmay remember that the heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike\nin showing their emotion.  Chang Yu alludes to the mournful\nparting at the I River between Ching K`o and his friends,  when\nthe former was sent to attempt the life of the King of Ch`in\n(afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C.  The tears of all flowed\ndown like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the following\nlines:   \"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the burn;  Your\nchampion is going--Not to return.\" [1] ]\n\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the\ncourage of a Chu or a Kuei.\n\n     [Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu\nState and contemporary with Sun Tzu himself, who was employed by\nKung-tzu Kuang, better known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his\nsovereign Wang Liao with a dagger which he secreted in the belly\nof a fish served up at a banquet.  He succeeded in his attempt,\nbut was immediately hacked to pieced by the king's bodyguard.\nThis was in 515 B.C.  The other hero referred to, Ts`ao Kuei  (or\nTs`ao Mo), performed the exploit which has made his name famous\n166 years earlier, in 681 B.C.  Lu had been thrice defeated by\nCh`i,  and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering a\nlarge slice of territory, when Ts`ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan\nKung, the Duke of Ch`i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a\ndagger against his chest.  None of the duke's retainers dared to\nmove   a muscle,  and Ts`ao Kuei proceeded to demand   full\nrestitution, declaring the Lu was being unjustly treated because\nshe was a smaller and a weaker state.  Huan Kung, in peril of his\nlife, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts`ao Kuei flung away his\ndagger   and quietly resumed his place amid the   terrified\nassemblage without having so much as changed color.  As was to be\nexpected,  the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain,\nbut his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him the\nimpolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold\nstroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three\npitched battles.]\n\n     29.  The skillful tactician may be likened to the SHUAI-JAN.\nNow the SHUAI-JAN is a snake that is found in the Ch`ang\nmountains.\n\n     [\"Shuai-jan\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in\nquestion was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its\nmovements.  Through this passage, the term in the Chinese has now\ncome to be used in the sense of \"military maneuvers.\"]\n\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail;  strike\nat its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its\nmiddle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.\n     30.  Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN,\n\n     [That is, as Mei Yao-ch`en says, \"Is it possible to make the\nfront and rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on\nthe other,  just as though they were part of a single living\nbody?\"]\n\nI should answer, Yes.  For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are\nenemies;\n\n     [Cf. VI. ss. 21.]\n\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught\nby a storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the\nleft hand helps the right.\n\n     [The meaning is:  If two enemies will help each other in a\ntime of common peril, how much more should two parts of the same\narmy,  bound together as they are by every tie of interest and\nfellow-feeling.  Yet it is notorious that many a campaign has\nbeen ruined through lack of cooperation, especially in the case\nof allied armies.]\n\n     31.  Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the\ntethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the\nground.\n\n     [These quaint devices to prevent one's army from running\naway recall the Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor\nwith him at the battle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened\nhimself firmly to one spot.  [See Herodotus, IX. 74.]  It is not\nenough,  says Sun Tzu,  to render flight impossible by such\nmechanical means.  You will not succeed unless your men have\ntenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all,  a spirit of\nsympathetic cooperation.  This is the lesson which can be learned\nfrom the SHUAI-JAN.]\n\n     32.  The principle on which to manage an army is to set up\none standard of courage which all must reach.\n\n     [Literally,  \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were\nthat of]  one.\"  If the ideal army is to form a single organic\nwhole,  then it follows that the resolution and spirit of its\ncomponent parts must be of the same quality, or at any rate must\nnot fall below a certain standard.  Wellington's seemingly\nungrateful description of his army at Waterloo as \"the worst he\nhad ever commanded\" meant no more than that it was deficient in\nthis important particular--unity of spirit and courage.  Had he\nnot foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept those\ntroops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the\nday.]\n\n     33.  How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a\nquestion involving the proper use of ground.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en's paraphrase is:  \"The way to eliminate the\ndifferences of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to\nutilize accidental features of the ground.\"   Less reliable\ntroops,  if posted in strong positions, will hold out as long as\nbetter troops on more exposed terrain.  The advantage of position\nneutralizes the inferiority in stamina and courage.   Col.\nHenderson says:  \"With all respect to the text books, and to the\nordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to think that the study\nof ground is often overlooked, and that by no means sufficient\nimportance is attached to the selection of positions...  and to\nthe immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\n\n     34.  Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as\nthough he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"The simile has reference to the ease with\nwhich he does it.\"]\n\n     35.  It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus\nensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\n     36.  He must be able to mystify his officers and men by\nfalse reports and appearances,\n\n     [Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\n\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms:  \"The\ntroops must not be allowed to share your schemes in the\nbeginning;  they may only rejoice with you over their happy\noutcome.\"  \"To mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy,\" is one\nof the first principles in war, as had been frequently pointed\nout.  But how about the other process--the mystification of one's\nown men?  Those who may think that Sun Tzu is over-emphatic on\nthis point would do well to read Col.  Henderson's remarks on\nStonewall Jackson's Valley campaign:  \"The infinite pains,\"  he\nsays,  \"with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most\ntrusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions,  and his\nthoughts,  a commander less thorough would have   pronounced\nuseless\"--etc.  etc. [3]  In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch.\n47 of the HOU HAN SHU, \"Pan Ch`ao took the field with 25,000 men\nfrom Khotan and other Central Asian states with the object of\ncrushing Yarkand.  The King of Kutcha replied by dispatching his\nchief commander to succor the place with an army drawn from the\nkingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t`ou, totaling 50,000 men.\nPan Ch`ao summoned his officers and also the King of Khotan to a\ncouncil of war, and said:  'Our forces are now outnumbered and\nunable to make head against the enemy.  The best plan, then,  is\nfor us to separate and disperse, each in a different direction.\nThe King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route, and I\nwill then return myself towards the west.  Let us wait until the\nevening drum has sounded and then start.'  Pan Ch`ao now secretly\nreleased the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of\nKutcha was thus informed of his plans.  Much elated by the news,\nthe latter set off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar\nPan Ch`ao's retreat in the west, while the King of Wen-su rode\neastward with 8000 horse in order to intercept the King of\nKhotan.  As soon as Pan Ch`ao knew that the two chieftains had\ngone,  he called his divisions together, got them well in hand,\nand at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it\nlay encamped.  The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion,\nand were closely pursued by Pan Ch`ao.  Over 5000 heads were\nbrought back as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of\nhorses and cattle and valuables of every description.  Yarkand\nthen capitulating, Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their\nrespective forces.  From that time forward, Pan Ch`ao's prestige\ncompletely overawed the countries of the west.\"  In this case, we\nsee that the Chinese general not only kept his own officers in\nignorance of his real plans, but actually took the bold step of\ndividing his army in order to deceive the enemy.]\n\n     37.  By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,\n\n     [Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same\nstratagem twice.]\n\nhe keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.\n\n     [Chang Yu,  in a quotation from another work,  says:   \"The\naxiom,  that war is based on deception, does not apply only to\ndeception of the enemy.  You must deceive even your own soldiers.\nMake them follow you, but without letting them know why.\"]\n\nBy shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes,  he prevents\nthe enemy from anticipating his purpose.\n     38.  At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like\none who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder\nbehind him.  He carries his men deep into hostile territory\nbefore he shows his hand.\n\n     [Literally, \"releases the spring\" (see V. ss. 15), that is,\ntakes some decisive step which makes it impossible for the army\nto return--like Hsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a\nriver.  Ch`en Hao, followed by Chia Lin, understands the words\nless well as \"puts forth every artifice at his command.\"]\n\n     39.  He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a\nshepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and\nthat, and nothing knows whither he is going.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:   \"The army is only cognizant of orders to\nadvance or retreat;  it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of\nattacking and conquering.\"]\n\n     40.  To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may\nbe termed the business of the general.\n\n     [Sun Tzu means that after mobilization there should be no\ndelay in aiming a blow at the enemy's heart.  Note how he returns\nagain and again to this point.  Among the warring states of\nancient China, desertion was no doubt a much more present fear\nand serious evil than it is in the armies of today.]\n\n     41.  The different measures suited to the nine varieties of\nground;\n\n     [Chang Yu says:  \"One must not be hide-bound in interpreting\nthe rules for the nine varieties of ground.]\n\nthe expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics;  and the\nfundamental laws of human nature:  these are things that must\nmost certainly be studied.\n     42.  When invading hostile territory, the general principle\nis,  that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a\nshort way means dispersion.\n\n     [Cf. supra, ss. 20.]\n\n     43.  When you leave your own country behind, and take your\narmy across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical\nground.\n\n     [This \"ground\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. ss. 2, but it\ndoes not figure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities\nin chap. X.  One's first impulse would be to translate it distant\nground,\" but this, if we can trust the commentators, is precisely\nwhat is not meant here.  Mei Yao-ch`en says it is \"a position not\nfar enough advanced to be called 'facile,' and not near enough to\nhome to be 'dispersive,' but something between the two.\"  Wang Hsi\nsays:  \"It is ground separated from home by an interjacent state,\nwhose territory we have had to cross in order to reach it.\nHence,  it is incumbent on us to settle our business there\nquickly.\"   He adds that this position is of rare occurrence,\nwhich is the reason why it is not included among the Nine\nSituations.]\n\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides,  the\nground is one of intersecting highways.\n     44.  When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious\nground.  When you penetrate but a little way,  it is facile\nground.\n     45.  When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and\nnarrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground.  When there is no\nplace of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.\n     46.  Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men\nwith unity of purpose.\n\n     [This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining\non the defensive, and avoiding battle.  Cf. supra, ss. 11.]\n\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection\nbetween all parts of my army.\n\n     [As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\ncontingencies:   \"(1)  the desertion of our own troops;  (2)  a\nsudden attack on the part of the enemy.\"  Cf. VII. ss. 17.  Mei\nYao-ch`en says:  \"On the march, the regiments should be in close\ntouch;  in an encampment, there should be continuity between the\nfortifications.\"]\n\n     47.  On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n\n     [This is Ts`ao Kung's interpretation.  Chang Yu adopts it,\nsaying:   \"We must quickly bring up our rear, so that head and\ntail may both reach the goal.\"  That is, they must not be allowed\nto straggle up a long way apart.  Mei Yao-ch`en offers another\nequally plausible explanation:  \"Supposing the enemy has not yet\nreached the coveted position, and we are behind him,  we should\nadvance with all speed in order to dispute its possession.\"\nCh`en Hao,  on the other hand, assuming that the enemy has had\ntime to select his own ground, quotes VI. ss. 1, where Sun Tzu\nwarns us against coming exhausted to the attack.  His own idea of\nthe situation is rather vaguely expressed:   \"If there is a\nfavorable position lying in front of you, detach a picked body of\ntroops to occupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers,\ncome up to make a fight for it, you may fall quickly on their\nrear with your main body, and victory will be assured.\"  It was\nthus,  he adds, that Chao She beat the army of Ch`in.  (See p.\n57.)]\n\n     48.  On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my\ndefenses.   On   ground of intersecting highways,   I   would\nconsolidate my alliances.\n     49.  On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous\nstream of supplies.\n\n     [The commentators take this as referring to forage and\nplunder,  not, as one might expect, to an unbroken communication\nwith a home base.]\n\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n     50.  On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n\n     [Meng Shih says:  \"To make it seem that I meant to defend\nthe position,  whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly\nthrough the enemy's lines.\"  Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"in order to\nmake my soldiers fight with desperation.\"   Wang Hsi says,\n\"fearing lest my men be tempted to run away.\"  Tu Mu points out\nthat this is the converse of VII. ss. 36, where it is the enemy\nwho is surrounded.  In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards Emperor and\ncanonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under Erh-\nchu Chao and others.  His own force was comparatively small,\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot.\nThe lines of investment had not been drawn very closely together,\ngaps being left at certain points.  But Kao Huan,  instead of\ntrying to escape,  actually made a shift to block all the\nremaining outlets himself by driving into them a number of oxen\nand donkeys roped together.  As soon as his officers and men saw\nthat there was nothing for it but to conquer or die,  their\nspirits rose to an extraordinary pitch of exaltation,  and they\ncharged with such desperate ferocity that the opposing ranks\nbroke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\n\nOn desperate ground,  I would proclaim to my soldiers the\nhopelessness of saving their lives.\n\n     Tu Yu says:  \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away\nyour stores and provisions, choke up the wells,  destroy your\ncooking-stoves,  and make it plain to your men that they cannot\nsurvive, but must fight to the death.\"  Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"The\nonly chance of life lies in giving up all hope of it.\"   This\nconcludes what Sun Tzu has to say about  \"grounds\"  and the\n\"variations\" corresponding to them.  Reviewing the passages which\nbear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be struck by\nthe desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is treated.\nSun Tzu begins abruptly in VIII. ss. 2 to enumerate  \"variations\"\nbefore touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five,\nnamely nos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is\nnot included in it.  A few varieties of ground are dealt with in\nthe earlier portion of chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six\nnew grounds, with six variations of plan to match.  None of these\nis   mentioned   again,  though the first is hardly   to   be\ndistinguished from ground no. 4 in the next chapter.  At last, in\nchap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par excellence, immediately\nfollowed by the variations.  This takes us down to ss.  14.  In\nSS. 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2, 8 and\n9  (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed\nin chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated\nonce more from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5,  6\nand 7, being different from those previously given.  Though it is\nimpossible to account for the present state of Sun Tzu's text,  a\nfew suggestive facts maybe brought into prominence:   (1)  Chap.\nVIII,  according to the title, should deal with nine variations,\nwhereas only five appear.  (2) It is an abnormally short chapter.\n(3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.  Several of these are\ndefined twice over, besides which there are two distinct lists of\nthe corresponding variations.  (4) The length of the chapter is\ndisproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.  I do\nnot propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the\ngeneral conclusion that Sun Tzu's work cannot have come down to\nus in the shape in which it left his hands:   chap.  VIII is\nobviously defective and probably out of place, while XI seems to\ncontain matter that has either been added by a later hand or\nought to appear elsewhere.]\n\n     51.  For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an\nobstinate resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he\ncannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into\ndanger.\n\n     [Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch`ao's devoted\nfollowers in 73 A.D.  The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch.\n47:  \"When Pan Ch`ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the\ncountry, received him at first with great politeness and respect;\nbut shortly afterwards his behavior underwent a sudden change,\nand he became remiss and negligent.  Pan Ch`ao spoke about this\nto the officers of his suite:  'Have you noticed,' he said, 'that\nKuang's polite intentions are on the wane?  This must signify\nthat envoys have come from the Northern barbarians,  and that\nconsequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with\nwhich side to throw in his lot.  That surely is the reason.  The\ntruly wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have\ncome to pass;  how much more, then,  those that are already\nmanifest!'   Thereupon he called one of the natives who had been\nassigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying:   'Where\nare those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?'\nThe man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he\npresently blurted out the whole truth.  Pan Ch`ao,  keeping his\ninformant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a general\ngathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking\nwith them.  When the wine had mounted into their heads a little,\nhe tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them\nthus:   'Gentlemen,  here we are in the heart of an isolated\nregion,  anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great\nexploit.  Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no\narrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is\nthat the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal\nhost has disappeared.  Should this envoy prevail upon him to\nseize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will\nbecome food for the wolves of the desert.  What are we to do?'\nWith one accord, the officers replied:  'Standing as we do in\nperil of our lives, we will follow our commander through life and\ndeath.'  For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. ss.  1,\nnote.]\n\n     52.  We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes\nuntil we are acquainted with their designs.  We are not fit to\nlead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of\nthe   country--its mountains and forests,  its pitfalls   and\nprecipices,  its marshes and swamps.  We shall be unable to turn\nnatural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides.\n\n     [These three sentences are repeated from VII. SS. 12-14  --\nin order to emphasize their importance, the commentators seem to\nthink.  I prefer to regard them as interpolated here in order to\nform an antecedent to the following words.  With regard to local\nguides, Sun Tzu might have added that there is always the risk of\ngoing   wrong,   either   through   their   treachery   or   some\nmisunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):  Hannibal,  we\nare told, ordered a guide to lead him into the neighborhood of\nCasinum,  where there was an important pass to be occupied;  but\nhis Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of Latin\nnames,  caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\nCasinum,  and turning from his proper route, he took the army in\nthat direction, the mistake not being discovered until they had\nalmost arrived.]\n\n     53.  To be ignored of any one of the following four or five\nprinciples does not befit a warlike prince.\n     54.  When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state,  his\ngeneralship shows itself in preventing the concentration of the\nenemy's forces.  He overawes his opponents, and their allies are\nprevented from joining against him.\n\n     [Mei Tao-ch`en constructs one of the chains of reasoning\nthat are so much affected by the Chinese:   \"In attacking a\npowerful state,  if you can divide her forces, you will have a\nsuperiority in strength; if you have a superiority in strength,\nyou will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy,  the\nneighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring\nstates are frightened, the enemy's allies will be prevented from\njoining her.\"  The following gives a stronger meaning:  \"If the\ngreat state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and\nrefrain from massing their forces.\"  Ch`en Hao and Chang Yu take\nthe sentence in quite another way.  The former says:   \"Powerful\nthough a prince may be, if he attacks a large state, he will be\nunable to raise enough troops, and must rely to some extent on\nexternal aid;  if he dispenses with this, and with overweening\nconfidence in his own strength, simply tries to intimidate the\nenemy, he will surely be defeated.\"  Chang Yu puts his view thus:\n\"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will be\ndiscontented and hang back.  But if (as will then be the case)\nour display of military force is inferior by half to that of the\nenemy,  the other chieftains will take fright and refuse to join\nus.\"]\n\n     55.  Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and\nsundry, nor does he foster the power of other states.  He carries\nout his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n\n     [The train of thought, as said by Li Ch`uan, appears to be\nthis:   Secure against a combination of his enemies,  \"he can\nafford to reject entangling alliances and simply pursue his own\nsecret designs, his prestige enable him to dispense with external\nfriendships.\"]\n\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their\nkingdoms.\n\n     [This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch`in\nState became a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy\nby which the famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for\nher final triumph under Shih Huang Ti.  Chang Yu,  following up\nhis previous note,  thinks that Sun Tzu is condemning this\nattitude of cold-blooded selfishness and haughty isolation.]\n\n     56.  Bestow rewards without regard to rule,\n\n     [Wu Tzu (ch. 3) less wisely says:  \"Let advance be richly\nrewarded and retreat be heavily punished.\"]\n\nissue orders\n\n     [Literally, \"hang\" or post up.\"]\n\nwithout regard to previous arrangements;\n\n     [\"In order to prevent treachery,\"  says Wang Hsi.  The\ngeneral meaning is made clear by Ts`ao Kung's quotation from the\nSSU-MA FA:  \"Give instructions only on sighting the enemy;  give\nrewards when you see deserving deeds.\"  Ts`ao Kung's paraphrase:\n\"The final instructions you give to your army should not\ncorrespond with those that have been previously posted up.\"\nChang Yu simplifies this into \"your arrangements should not be\ndivulged beforehand.\"  And Chia Lin says:  \"there should be no\nfixity in your rules and arrangements.\"  Not only is there danger\nin letting your plans be known, but war often necessitates the\nentire reversal of them at the last moment.]\n\nand you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to\ndo with but a single man.\n\n     [Cf. supra, ss. 34.]\n\n     57.  Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let\nthem know your design.\n\n     [Literally, \"do not tell them words;\" i.e. do not give your\nreasons for any order.  Lord Mansfield once told a junior\ncolleague to \"give no reasons\" for his decisions, and the maxim\nis even more applicable to a general than to a judge.]\n\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell\nthem nothing when the situation is gloomy.\n     58.  Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive;\nplunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.\n\n     [These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in\nexplanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most\nbrilliant battles, already alluded to on p. 28.  In 204 B.C.,  he\nwas sent against the army of Chao, and halted ten miles from the\nmouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the enemy had mustered in\nfull force.  Here, at midnight, he detached a body of 2000 light\ncavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag.  Their\ninstructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and\nkeep a secret watch on the enemy.  \"When the men of Chao see me\nin full flight,\"  Han Hsin said,  \"they will abandon their\nfortifications and give chase.  This must be the sign for you to\nrush in, pluck down the Chao standards and set up the red banners\nof Han in their stead.\"  Turning then to his other officers,  he\nremarked:   \"Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not\nlikely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and\ndrums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and\nescape through the mountains.\"  So saying, he first of all sent\nout a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them to form\nin line of battle with their backs to the River Ti.  Seeing this\nmaneuver,  the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter.  By\nthis time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin,  displaying the\ngeneralissimo's flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating,\nand was immediately engaged by the enemy.  A great battle\nfollowed, lasting for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his\ncolleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and banner on the field,  fled\nto the division on the river bank, where another fierce battle\nwas raging.  The enemy rushed out to pursue them and to secure\nthe trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but the two\ngenerals succeeded in joining the other army, which was fighting\nwith the utmost desperation.  The time had now come for the 2000\nhorsemen to play their part.  As soon as they saw the men of Chao\nfollowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted\nwalls,  tore up the enemy's flags and replaced them by those of\nHan.  When the Chao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight\nof these red flags struck them with terror.  Convinced that the\nHans had got in and overpowered their king, they broke up in wild\ndisorder, every effort of their leader to stay the panic being in\nvain.  Then the Han army fell on them from both sides and\ncompleted the rout, killing a number and capturing the rest,\namongst whom was King Ya himself....  After the battle, some of\nHan Hsin's officers came to him and said:  \"In the ART OF WAR we\nare told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river\nor marsh on the left front.  [This appears to be a blend of Sun\nTzu and T`ai Kung.  See IX ss. 9, and note.]   You,  on the\ncontrary, ordered us to draw up our troops with the river at our\nback.  Under these conditions, how did you manage to gain the\nvictory?\"   The general replied:  \"I fear you gentlemen have not\nstudied the Art of War with sufficient care.  Is it not written\nthere:  'Plunge your army into desperate straits and it will come\noff in safety; place it in deadly peril and it will survive'?\nHad I taken the usual course, I should never have been able to\nbring my colleague round.  What says the Military Classic--'Swoop\ndown on the market-place and drive the men off to fight.'   [This\npassage does not occur in the present text of Sun Tzu.]  If I had\nnot placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to\nfight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow his own\ndiscretion,  there would have been a general debandade,  and it\nwould have been impossible to do anything with them.\"   The\nofficers admitted the force of his argument, and said:   \"These\nare higher tactics than we should have been capable of.\"   [See\nCH`IEN HAN SHU, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.] ]\n\n     59.  For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's\nway that is capable of striking a blow for victory.\n\n     [Danger has a bracing effect.]\n\n     60.  Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating\nourselves to the enemy's purpose.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says:  \"Feign stupidity\"--by an appearance of\nyielding and falling in with the enemy's wishes.  Chang Yu's note\nmakes the meaning clear:  \"If the enemy shows an inclination to\nadvance, lure him on to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay\non purpose that he may carry out his intention.\"  The object is\nto make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our\nattack.]\n\n     61.  By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank,\n\n     [I understand the first four words to mean \"accompanying the\nenemy in one direction.\"  Ts`ao Kung says:  \"unite the soldiers\nand make for the enemy.\"  But such a violent displacement of\ncharacters is quite indefensible.]\n\nwe shall succeed in the long run\n\n     [Literally, \"after a thousand LI.\"]\n\nin killing the commander-in-chief.\n\n     [Always a great point with the Chinese.]\n\n     62.  This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer\ncunning.\n     63.  On the day that you take up your command,  block the\nfrontier passes, destroy the official tallies,\n\n     [These were tablets of bamboo or wood, one half of which was\nissued as a permit or passport by the official in charge of a\ngate.  Cf. the \"border-warden\" of LUN YU III. 24, who may have\nhad similar duties.  When this half was returned to him, within a\nfixed period,  he was authorized to open the gate and let the\ntraveler through.]\n\nand stop the passage of all emissaries.\n\n     [Either to or from the enemy's country.]\n\n     64.  Be stern in the council-chamber,\n\n     [Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified\nby the sovereign.]\n\nso that you may control the situation.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en understands the whole sentence to mean:  Take\nthe   strictest   precautions   to   ensure   secrecy   in   your\ndeliberations.]\n\n     65.  If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.\n     66.  Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,\n\n     [Cf. supra, ss. 18.]\n\nand subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.\n\n     [Ch`en Hao`s explanation:  \"If I manage to seize a favorable\nposition,  but the enemy does not appear on the scene,  the\nadvantage thus obtained cannot be turned to any practical\naccount.  He who intends therefore, to occupy a position of\nimportance to the enemy,  must begin by making an   artful\nappointment,  so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him\ninto going there as well.\"  Mei Yao-ch`en explains that this\n\"artful appointment\"  is to be made through the medium of the\nenemy's own spies,  who will carry back just the amount of\ninformation that we choose to give them.  Then, having cunningly\ndisclosed our intentions, \"we must manage, though starting after\nthe enemy,  to arrive before him (VII. ss. 4).  We must start\nafter him in order to ensure his marching thither; we must arrive\nbefore him in order to capture the place without trouble.  Taken\nthus,  the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch`en's\ninterpretation of ss. 47.]\n\n     67.  Walk in the path defined by rule,\n\n     [Chia Lin says:  \"Victory is the only thing that matters,\nand this cannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons.\"\nIt is unfortunate that this variant rests on very slight\nauthority,   for the sense yielded is certainly much   more\nsatisfactory.  Napoleon, as we know, according to the veterans of\nthe old school whom he defeated, won his battles by violating\nevery accepted canon of warfare.]\n\nand accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a\ndecisive battle.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:   \"Conform to the enemy's tactics until a\nfavorable opportunity offers; then come forth and engage in a\nbattle that shall prove decisive.\"]\n\n     68.  At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden,  until\nthe enemy gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity\nof a running hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to\noppose you.\n\n     [As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity,  the\ncomparison hardly appears felicitous.  But of course Sun Tzu was\nthinking only of its speed.  The words have been taken to mean:\nYou must flee from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare;  but\nthis is rightly rejected by Tu Mu.]\n\n\n[1]  Giles' Biographical Dictionary, no. 399.\n\n[2]  \"The Science of War,\" p. 333.\n\n[3]  \"Stonewall Jackson,\" vol. I, p. 421.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXII.  THE ATTACK BY FIRE\n\n\n     [Rather more than half the chapter (SS. 1-13) is devoted to\nthe subject of fire, after which the author branches off into\nother topics.]\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  There are five ways of attacking with\nfire.  The first is to burn soldiers in their camp;\n\n     [So Tu Mu.  Li Ch`uan says:  \"Set fire to the camp, and kill\nthe soldiers\"  (when they try to escape from the flames).  Pan\nCh`ao, sent on a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see\nXI.  ss. 51, note], found himself placed in extreme peril by the\nunexpected arrival of an envoy from the Hsiung-nu  [the mortal\nenemies of the Chinese].  In consultation with his officers,  he\nexclaimed:  \"Never venture, never win! [1]  The only course open\nto us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under\ncover of night,  when they will not be able to discern our\nnumbers.  Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them\ncompletely;  this will cool the King's courage and cover us with\nglory,  besides ensuring the success of our mission.'   the\nofficers all replied that it would be necessary to discuss the\nmatter first with the Intendant.  Pan Ch`ao then fell into a\npassion:   'It is today,' he cried, 'that our fortunes must be\ndecided!   The Intendant is only a humdrum civilian,  who on\nhearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and everything\nwill be brought to light.  An inglorious death is no worthy fate\nfor valiant warriors.'   All then agreed to do as he wished.\nAccordingly,  as soon as night came on, he and his little band\nquickly made their way to the barbarian camp.  A strong gale was\nblowing at the time.  Pan Ch`ao ordered ten of the party to take\ndrums and hide behind the enemy's barracks, it being arranged\nthat when they saw flames shoot up, they should begin drumming\nand yelling with all their might.  The rest of his men,  armed\nwith bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade at the gate of\nthe camp.  He then set fire to the place from the windward side,\nwhereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the\nfront and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in\nfrantic disorder.  Pan Ch`ao slew three of them with his own\nhand,  while his companions cut off the heads of the envoy and\nthirty of his suite.  The remainder, more than a hundred in all,\nperished in the flames.  On the following day,  Pan Ch`ao,\ndivining his thoughts, said with uplifted hand:  'Although you\ndid not go with us last night, I should not think, Sir, of taking\nsole credit for our exploit.'  This satisfied Kuo Hsun, and Pan\nCh`ao,  having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\nhead of the barbarian envoy.  The whole kingdom was seized with\nfear and trembling,  which Pan Ch`ao took steps to allay by\nissuing a public proclamation.  Then, taking the king's sons as\nhostage, he returned to make his report to Tou Ku.\"  HOU HAN SHU,\nch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]\n\nthe second is to burn stores;\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"Provisions, fuel and fodder.\"  In order to\nsubdue   the   rebellious population of Kiangnan,   Kao   Keng\nrecommended Wen Ti of the Sui dynasty to make periodical raids\nand burn their stores of grain, a policy which in the long run\nproved entirely successful.]\n\nthe third is to burn baggage trains;\n\n     [An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao`s wagons\nand impedimenta by Ts`ao Ts`ao in 200 A.D.]\n\nthe fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;\n\n     [Tu Mu says that the things contained in  \"arsenals\"  and\n\"magazines\"  are the same.  He specifies weapons and other\nimplements, bullion and clothing.  Cf. VII. ss. 11.]\n\nthe fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.\n\n     [Tu Yu says in the T`UNG TIEN:  \"To drop fire into the\nenemy's camp.  The method by which this may be done is to set the\ntips of arrows alight by dipping them into a brazier,  and then\nshoot them from powerful crossbows into the enemy's lines.\"]\n\n     2.  In order to carry out an attack, we must have means\navailable.\n\n     [T`sao Kung thinks that \"traitors in the enemy's camp\"  are\nreferred to.  But Ch`en Hao is more likely to be right in saying:\n\"We must have favorable circumstances in general,  not merely\ntraitors to help us.\"  Chia Lin says:  \"We must avail ourselves\nof wind and dry weather.\"]\n\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.\n\n     [Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire:  \"dry vegetable\nmatter, reeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\"  Here we have\nthe material cause.  Chang Yu says:  \"vessels for hoarding fire,\nstuff for lighting fires.\"]\n\n     3.  There is a proper season for making attacks with fire,\nand special days for starting a conflagration.\n     4.  The proper season is when the weather is very dry;  the\nspecial days are those when the moon is in the constellations of\nthe Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;\n\n     [These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of\nthe Twenty-eight Stellar Mansions,  corresponding roughly to\nSagittarius, Pegasus, Crater and Corvus.]\n\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\n     5.  In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet\nfive possible developments:\n     6.  (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond\nat once with an attack from without.\n     7.  (2)  If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's\nsoldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack.\n\n     [The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the\nenemy into confusion.  If this effect is not produced, it means\nthat the enemy is ready to receive us.  Hence the necessity for\ncaution.]\n\n     8.  (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height,\nfollow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay\nwhere you are.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung says:  \"If you see a possible way, advance;  but\nif you find the difficulties too great, retire.\"]\n\n     9.  (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from\nwithout, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your\nattack at a favorable moment.\n\n     [Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to\nthe fire breaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by\nthe agency of incendiaries) inside the enemy's camp.  \"But,\"  he\ncontinues,  \"if the enemy is settled in a waste place littered\nwith quantities of grass, or if he has pitched his camp in a\nposition which can be burnt out, we must carry our fire against\nhim at any seasonable opportunity, and not await on in hopes of\nan outbreak occurring within, for fear our opponents should\nthemselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and thus render\nour own attempts fruitless.\"  The famous Li Ling once baffled the\nleader of the Hsiung-nu in this way.  The latter,  taking\nadvantage of a favorable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese\ngeneral's camp,  but found that every scrap of combustible\nvegetation in the neighborhood had already been burnt down.  On\nthe other hand, Po-ts`ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels,\nwas badly defeated in 184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple\nprecaution.  \"At the head of a large army he was besieging\nCh`ang-she,  which was held by Huang-fu Sung.  The garrison was\nvery small,  and a general feeling of nervousness pervaded the\nranks;  so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and said:\n\"In war,  there are various indirect methods of attack,  and\nnumbers do not count for everything.  [The commentator here\nquotes Sun Tzu, V. SS. 5, 6 and 10.]  Now the rebels have pitched\ntheir camp in the midst of thick grass which will easily burn\nwhen the wind blows.  If we set fire to it at night, they will be\nthrown into a panic, and we can make a sortie and attack them on\nall sides at once, thus emulating the achievement of T`ien Tan.'\n[See p. 90.]  That same evening, a strong breeze sprang up;  so\nHuang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind reeds together into\ntorches and mount guard on the city walls, after which he sent\nout a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way through\nthe lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.\nSimultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and\nHuang-fu Sung,  sounding his drums, led a rapid charge,  which\nthrew the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\"\n[HOU HAN SHU, ch. 71.] ]\n\n     10.  (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it.  Do\nnot attack from the leeward.\n\n     [Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says:  \"When you make a fire,\nthe enemy will retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat\nand attack him then, he will fight desperately, which will not\nconduce to your success.\"  A rather more obvious explanation is\ngiven by Tu Mu:  \"If the wind is in the east, begin burning to\nthe east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from\nthat side.  If you start the fire on the east side,  and then\nattack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your\nenemy.\"]\n\n     11.  A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long,  but a\nnight breeze soon falls.\n\n     [Cf.  Lao Tzu's saying:  \"A violent wind does not last the\nspace of a morning.\"  (TAO TE CHING, chap. 23.)   Mei Yao-ch`en\nand Wang Hsi say:  \"A day breeze dies down at nightfall,  and a\nnight breeze at daybreak.  This is what happens as a general\nrule.\"   The phenomenon observed may be correct enough,  but how\nthis sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\n\n     12.  In every army, the five developments connected with\nfire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a\nwatch kept for the proper days.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"We must make calculations as to the paths of\nthe stars,  and watch for the days on which wind will rise,\nbefore making our attack with fire.\"  Chang Yu seems to interpret\nthe text differently:  \"We must not only know how to assail our\nopponents with fire, but also be on our guard against similar\nattacks from them.\"]\n\n     13.  Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show\nintelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an\naccession of strength.\n     14.  By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not\nrobbed of all his belongings.\n\n     [Ts`ao Kung's note is:  \"We can merely obstruct the enemy's\nroad or divide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated\nstores.\"  Water can do useful service, but it lacks the terrible\ndestructive power of fire.  This is the reason,  Chang Yu\nconcludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple of sentences,\nwhereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail.  Wu Tzu  (ch.\n4)  speaks thus of the two elements:  \"If an army is encamped on\nlow-lying marshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and\nwhere the rainfall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood.  If\nan army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with\nweeds and brambles, and visited by frequent gales,  it may be\nexterminated by fire.\"]\n\n     15.  Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles\nand succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of\nenterprise;  for the result is waste of time and   general\nstagnation.\n\n     [This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzu.\nTs`ao Kung says:   \"Rewards for good service should not be\ndeferred a single day.\"   And Tu Mu:   \"If you do not take\nopportunity   to   advance and reward   the   deserving,   your\nsubordinates will not carry out your commands, and disaster will\nensue.\"   For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\nformidable array of scholars on the other side,  I prefer the\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch`en alone, whose words I\nwill quote:  \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their\nbattles and assaults must seize the favorable moments when they\ncome and not shrink on occasion from heroic measures:  that is to\nsay, they must resort to such means of attack of fire, water and\nthe like.  What they must not do, and what will prove fatal,  is\nto sit still and simply hold to the advantages they have got.\"]\n\n     16.  Hence the saying:  The enlightened ruler lays his plans\nwell ahead; the good general cultivates his resources.\n\n     [Tu Mu quotes the following from the SAN LUEH, ch. 2:   \"The\nwarlike prince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them\ntogether by good faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable.\nIf faith decays,  there will be disruption;  if rewards are\ndeficient, commands will not be respected.\"]\n\n     17.  Move not unless you see an advantage;  use not your\ntroops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless\nthe position is critical.\n\n     [Sun Tzu may at times appear to be over-cautious,  but he\nnever goes so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in\nthe TAO TE CHING, ch. 69.  \"I dare not take the initiative,  but\nprefer to act on the defensive; I dare not advance an inch,  but\nprefer to retreat a foot.\"]\n\n     18.  No ruler should put troops into the field merely to\ngratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply\nout of pique.\n     19.  If it is to your advantage, make a forward move;  if\nnot, stay where you are.\n\n     [This is repeated from XI. ss. 17.  Here I feel convinced\nthat it is an interpolation, for it is evident that ss. 20 ought\nto follow immediately on ss. 18.]\n\n     20.  Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be\nsucceeded by content.\n     21.  But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never\ncome again into being;\n\n     [The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of\nthis saying.]\n\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\n     22.  Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good\ngeneral full of caution.  This is the way to keep a country at\npeace and an army intact.\n\n\n[1]   \"Unless you enter the tiger's lair, you cannot get hold of\nthe tiger's cubs.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nXIII.  THE USE OF SPIES\n\n\n     1.  Sun Tzu said:  Raising a host of a hundred thousand men\nand marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the\npeople and a drain on the resources of the State.  The daily\nexpenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver.\n\n     [Cf. II. ss. ss. 1, 13, 14.]\n\nThere will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop\ndown exhausted on the highways.\n\n     [Cf.  TAO TE CHING,  ch.  30:   \"Where troops have been\nquartered, brambles and thorns spring up.  Chang Yu has the note:\n\"We may be reminded of the saying:  'On serious ground, gather in\nplunder.'   Why then should carriage and transportation cause\nexhaustion on the highways?--The answer is, that not victuals\nalone,  but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to\nthe army.  Besides, the injunction to 'forage on the enemy'  only\nmeans that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory,\nscarcity of food must be provided against.  Hence, without being\nsolely dependent on the enemy for corn, we must forage in order\nthat there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies.  Then,\nagain, there are places like salt deserts where provisions being\nunobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed with.\"]\n\nAs many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in\ntheir labor.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"Men will be lacking at the plough-\ntail.\"  The allusion is to the system of dividing land into nine\nparts, each consisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center\nbeing cultivated on behalf of the State by the tenants of the\nother eight.  It was here also, so Tu Mu tells us,  that their\ncottages were built and a well sunk, to be used by all in common.\n[See II. ss. 12, note.]  In time of war, one of the families had\nto serve in the army, while the other seven contributed to its\nsupport.  Thus,  by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one able-\nbodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families\nwould be affected.]\n\n     2.  Hostile armies may face each other for years,  striving\nfor the victory which is decided in a single day.  This being so,\nto remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because\none grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors\nand emoluments,\n\n     [\"For spies\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil\nthe effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were\nactually mentioned at this point.]\n\nis the height of inhumanity.\n\n     [Sun Tzu's agreement is certainly ingenious.  He begins by\nadverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood\nand treasure which war always brings in its train.  Now,  unless\nyou are kept informed of the enemy's condition, and are ready to\nstrike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years.  The\nonly way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is\nimpossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly\npaid for their services.  But it is surely false economy to\ngrudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose,  when\nevery day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum.\nThis grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor,  and\nhence Sun Tzu concludes that to neglect the use of spies is\nnothing less than a crime against humanity.]\n\n     3.  One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help\nto his sovereign, no master of victory.\n\n     [This idea, that the true object of war is peace,  has its\nroot in the national temperament of the Chinese.  Even so far\nback as 597 B.C., these memorable words were uttered by Prince\nChuang of the Ch`u State:  \"The [Chinese] character for 'prowess'\nis made up of [the characters for] 'to stay'  and  'a spear'\n(cessation of hostilities).  Military prowess is seen in the\nrepression   of   cruelty,  the calling in of   weapons,   the\npreservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm establishment\nof merit,  the bestowal of happiness on the people,  putting\nharmony between the princes, the diffusion of wealth.\"]\n\n     4.  Thus,  what enables the wise sovereign and the good\ngeneral to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the\nreach of ordinary men, is FOREKNOWLEDGE.\n\n     [That is, knowledge of the enemy's dispositions, and what he\nmeans to do.]\n\n     5.  Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits;\nit cannot be obtained inductively from experience,\n\n     [Tu Mu's note is:  \"[knowledge of the enemy]  cannot be\ngained by reasoning from other analogous cases.\"]\n\nnor by any deductive calculation.\n\n     [Li   Ch`uan says:   \"Quantities like   length,   breadth,\ndistance and magnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical\ndetermination; human actions cannot be so calculated.\"]\n\n     6.  Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be\nobtained from other men.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en has rather an interesting note:   \"Knowledge\nof the spirit-world is to be obtained by divination;  information\nin natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws\nof the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation:  but\nthe dispositions of an enemy are ascertainable through spies and\nspies alone.\"]\n\n     7.  Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes:\n(1)  Local spies;  (2) inward spies; (3)  converted spies;  (4)\ndoomed spies; (5) surviving spies.\n     8.  When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can\ndiscover the secret system.  This is called \"divine manipulation\nof the threads.\"  It is the sovereign's most precious faculty.\n\n     [Cromwell,  one of the greatest and most practical of all\ncavalry leaders,  had officers styled  'scout masters,'  whose\nbusiness it was to collect all possible information regarding the\nenemy, through scouts and spies, etc., and much of his success in\nwar was traceable to the previous knowledge of the enemy's moves\nthus gained.\" [1] ]\n\n     9.  Having LOCAL SPIES means employing the services of the\ninhabitants of a district.\n\n     [Tu Mu says:  \"In the enemy's country, win people over by\nkind treatment, and use them as spies.\"]\n\n     10.  Having INWARD SPIES, making use of officials of the\nenemy.\n\n     [Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good\nservice in this respect:  \"Worthy men who have been degraded from\noffice,  criminals who have undergone punishment; also,  favorite\nconcubines who are greedy for gold, men who are aggrieved at\nbeing in subordinate positions, or who have been passed over in\nthe distribution of posts, others who are anxious that their side\nshould be defeated in order that they may have a chance of\ndisplaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who always\nwant to have a foot in each boat.  Officials of these several\nkinds,\" he continues, \"should be secretly approached and bound to\none's interests by means of rich presents.  In this way you will\nbe able to find out the state of affairs in the enemy's country,\nascertain the plans that are being formed against you,  and\nmoreover disturb the harmony and create a breach between the\nsovereign and his ministers.\"  The necessity for extreme caution,\nhowever,  in dealing with  \"inward spies,\"  appears from   an\nhistorical incident related by Ho Shih:  \"Lo Shang, Governor of\nI-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel Li Hsiung of\nShu in his stronghold at P`i.  After each side had experienced a\nnumber of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse to the\nservices of a certain P`o-t`ai, a native of Wu-tu.  He began to\nhave him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to\nLo Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him\nfrom inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right\nmoment for making a general assault.  Lo Shang,  confiding in\nthese promises, march out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po\nand others at their head with orders to attack at P`o-t`ai's\nbidding.  Meanwhile, Li Hsiung's general, Li Hsiang, had prepared\nan ambuscade on their line of march; and P`o-t`ai, having reared\nlong scaling-ladders against the city walls,  now lighted the\nbeacon-fire.  Wei Po's men raced up on seeing the signal and\nbegan climbing the ladders as fast as they could,  while others\nwere drawn up by ropes lowered from above.  More than a hundred\nof Lo Shang's soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of\nwhom was forthwith beheaded.  Li Hsiung then charged with all his\nforces,  both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy\ncompletely.\"  [This happened in 303 A.D.  I do not know where Ho\nShih got the story from.  It is not given in the biography of Li\nHsiung or that of his father Li T`e, CHIN SHU, ch. 120, 121.]\n\n     11.  Having CONVERTED SPIES, getting hold of the enemy's\nspies and using them for our own purposes.\n\n     [By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching\nthem from the enemy's service, and inducing them to carry back\nfalse information as well as to spy in turn on their own\ncountrymen.  On the other hand, Hsiao Shih-hsien says that we\npretend not to have detected him, but contrive to let him carry\naway a false impression of what is going on.  Several of the\ncommentators accept this as an alternative definition; but that\nit is not what Sun Tzu meant is conclusively proved by his\nsubsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously\n(ss. 21 sqq.).  Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted\nspies were used with conspicuous success:  (1) by T`ien Tan in\nhis defense of Chi-mo (see supra, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his\nmarch to O-yu (see p. 57); and by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C.,\nwhen Lien P`o was conducting a defensive campaign against Ch`in.\nThe King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P`o's cautious and\ndilatory methods,  which had been unable to avert a series of\nminor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to the reports of\nhis spies,  who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were\nalready in Fan Chu's pay.  They said:  \"The only thing which\ncauses Ch`in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general.\nLien P`o they consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be\nvanquished in the long run.\"  Now this Chao Kua was a son of the\nfamous Chao She.  From his boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed\nin the study of war and military matters, until at last he came\nto believe that there was no commander in the whole Empire who\ncould stand against him.  His father was much disquieted by this\noverweening conceit,  and the flippancy with which he spoke of\nsuch a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if ever\nKua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of\nChao.  This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from\nhis own mother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now\nsent to succeed Lien P`o.  Needless to say, he proved no match\nfor the redoubtable Po Ch`i and the great military power of\nCh`in.  He fell into a trap by which his army was divided into\ntwo and his communications cut; and after a desperate resistance\nlasting 46 days, during which the famished soldiers devoured one\nanother, he was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole force,\namounting,  it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the\nsword.]\n\n     12.  Having DOOMED SPIES, doing certain things openly for\npurposes of deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and\nreport them to the enemy.\n\n     [Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning:   \"We\nostentatiously do thing calculated to deceive our own spies,  who\nmust be led to believe that they have been unwittingly disclosed.\nThen,  when these spies are captured in the enemy's lines,  they\nwill make an entirely false report, and the enemy will take\nmeasures accordingly,  only to find that we do something quite\ndifferent.  The spies will thereupon be put to death.\"   As an\nexample of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released\nby Pan Ch`ao in his campaign against Yarkand.  (See p. 132.)   He\nalso refers to T`ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T`ai\nTsung to lull the Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security,\nuntil Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing blow against him.\nChang Yu says that the Turks revenged themselves by killing T`ang\nChien, but this is a mistake, for we read in both the old and the\nNew   T`ang History  (ch.  58,  fol.  2 and ch.  89,  fol.  8\nrespectively)  that he escaped and lived on until 656.  Li I-chi\nplayed a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when sent by the King\nof Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch`i.  He has certainly\nmore claim to be described a \"doomed spy\", for the king of Ch`i,\nbeing subsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin,  and\ninfuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi,\nordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]\n\n     13.  SURVIVING SPIES, finally, are those who bring back news\nfrom the enemy's camp.\n\n     [This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called,\nforming a regular part of the army.  Tu Mu says:  \"Your surviving\nspy must be a man of keen intellect, though in outward appearance\na fool; of shabby exterior, but with a will of iron.  He must be\nactive,  robust,  endowed with physical strength and courage;\nthoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work, able to endure\nhunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy.\"  Ho Shih\ntells the following story of Ta`hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty:  \"When\nhe was governor of Eastern Ch`in, Shen-wu of Ch`i made a hostile\nmovement upon Sha-yuan.  The Emperor T`ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu]  sent\nTa-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy.  He was accompanied by two other\nmen.  All three were on horseback and wore the enemy's uniform.\nWhen it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from\nthe enemy's camp and stealthily crept up to listen,  until they\nsucceeded in catching the passwords used in the army.  Then they\ngot on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp\nunder the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once,  happening\nto come across a soldier who was committing some breach of\ndiscipline,  they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound\ncudgeling!  Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible\ninformation about the enemy's dispositions, and received warm\ncommendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report\nwas able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.\"]\n\n     14.  Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more\nintimate relations to be maintained than with spies.\n\n     [Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch`en point out that the spy is\nprivileged to enter even the general's private sleeping-tent.]\n\nNone should be more liberally rewarded.  In no other business\nshould greater secrecy be preserved.\n\n     [Tu Mu gives a graphic touch:  all communication with spies\nshould be carried \"mouth-to-ear.\"  The following remarks on spies\nmay be quoted from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them\nthan any previous commander:  \"Spies are attached to those who\ngive them most,  he who pays them ill is never served.  They\nshould never be known to anybody; nor should they know one\nanother.  When they propose anything very material, secure their\npersons,  or have in your possession their wives and children as\nhostages for their fidelity.  Never communicate anything to them\nbut what is absolutely necessary that they should know. [2] ]\n\n     15.  Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain\nintuitive sagacity.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en says:  \"In order to use them, one must know\nfact from falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty\nand double-dealing.\"   Wang Hsi in a different interpretation\nthinks more along the lines of  \"intuitive perception\"  and\n\"practical   intelligence.\"    Tu Mu strangely   refers   these\nattributes to the spies themselves:  \"Before using spies we must\nassure ourselves as to their integrity of character and the\nextent of their experience and skill.\"  But he continues:   \"A\nbrazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous than\nmountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such.\"\nSo that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the\npassage.\"]\n\n     16.  They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and\nstraightforwardness.\n\n     [Chang   Yu says:   \"When you have attracted   them   by\nsubstantial offers, you must treat them with absolute sincerity;\nthen they will work for you with all their might.\"]\n\n     17.  Without subtle ingenuity of mind,  one cannot make\ncertain of the truth of their reports.\n\n     [Mei Yao-ch`en says:   \"Be on your guard against   the\npossibility of spies going over to the service of the enemy.\"]\n\n     18.  Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind\nof business.\n\n     [Cf. VI. ss. 9.]\n\n     19.  If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before\nthe time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man\nto whom the secret was told.\n\n     [Word for word, the translation here is:  \"If spy matters\nare heard before [our plans] are carried out,\" etc.  Sun Tzu's\nmain point in this passage is:  Whereas you kill the spy himself\n\"as a punishment for letting out the secret,\"  the object of\nkilling the other man is only, as Ch`en Hao puts it, \"to stop his\nmouth\"  and prevent news leaking any further.  If it had already\nbeen repeated to others, this object would not be gained.  Either\nway,  Sun Tzu lays himself open to the charge of inhumanity,\nthough Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man deserves\nto be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told the\nsecret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of\nhim.\"]\n\n     20.  Whether the object be to crush an army,  to storm a\ncity, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to\nbegin by finding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de-\ncamp,\n\n     [Literally  \"visitors\",  is equivalent, as Tu Yu says,  to\n\"those whose duty it is to keep the general supplied with\ninformation,\"  which naturally necessitates frequent interviews\nwith him.]\n\nand door-keepers and sentries of the general in command.  Our\nspies must be commissioned to ascertain these.\n\n     [As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of\nthese important functionaries can be won over by bribery.]\n\n     21.  The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be\nsought out, tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed.\nThus they will become converted spies and available for our\nservice.\n     22.  It is through the information brought by the converted\nspy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward\nspies.\n\n     [Tu Yu says:  \"through conversion of the enemy's spies we\nlearn the enemy's condition.\"  And Chang Yu says:  \"We must tempt\nthe converted spy into our service, because it is he that knows\nwhich of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of\nthe officials are open to corruption.\"]\n\n     23.  It is owing to his information, again,  that we can\ncause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.\n\n     [Chang Yu says, \"because the converted spy knows how the\nenemy can best be deceived.\"]\n\n     24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy\ncan be used on appointed occasions.\n     25.  The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is\nknowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived,\nin the first instance, from the converted spy.\n\n     [As explained in ss. 22-24.  He not only brings information\nhimself,  but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to\nadvantage.]\n\nHence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the\nutmost liberality.\n     26. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty\n\n     [Sun Tzu means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C.  Its\nname was changed to Yin by P`an Keng in 1401.\n\nwas due to I Chih\n\n     [Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman\nwho took part in Ch`eng T`ang's campaign against Chieh Kuei.]\n\nwho had served under the Hsia.  Likewise, the rise of the Chou\ndynasty was due to Lu Ya\n\n     [Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin,\nwhom he afterwards helped to overthrow.  Popularly known as T`ai\nKung,  a title bestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have\ncomposed a treatise on war, erroneously identified with the\nLIU T`AO.]\n\nwho had served under the Yin.\n\n     [There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought\nit well to introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on\nthe passage are by no means explicit.  But, having regard to the\ncontext,  we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzu is holding up I Chih\nand Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy,  or\nsomething closely analogous.  His suggestion is, that the Hsia\nand Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of\ntheir weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers\nwere able to impart to the other side.  Mei Yao-ch`en appears to\nresent any such aspersion on these historic names:  \"I Yin and Lu\nYa,\"  he says, \"were not rebels against the Government.  Hsia\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him.  Yin could\nnot employ the latter, hence Hou employed him.  Their great\nachievements were all for the good of the people.\"  Ho Shih is\nalso indignant:  \"How should two divinely inspired men such as I\nand Lu have acted as common spies?  Sun Tzu's mention of them\nsimply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is\na matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I\nand Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task.\nThe above words only emphasize this point.\"  Ho Shih believes\nthen that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their\nsupposed skill in the use of spies.  But this is very weak.]\n\n     27.  Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise\ngeneral who will use the highest intelligence of the army for\npurposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results.\n\n     [Tu Mu closes with a note of warning:  \"Just as water, which\ncarries a boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of\nsinking it, so reliance on spies, while production of great\nresults, is oft-times the cause of utter destruction.\"]\n\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them\ndepends an army's ability to move.\n\n     [Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man with\nears or eyes.]\n\n\n\n[1]  \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 2.\n\n[2]  \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 311.\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF WAR ***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 132.txt or 132.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/3\/132\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibiblio.org\/gutenberg\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":1391,"split":"test"}
