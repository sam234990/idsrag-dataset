{"ori_id":"49981df2afcb8a656e10eb87b3acd859783eb046","title":"Margin Call (film)","context":"Margin Call (film)\n Junior risk analyst Seth Bregman (Penn Badgley), his more senior colleague Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), and trading desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) watch as human resources staff of their (never-named) firm, along with building security, conduct an unannounced mass layoff right on their trading floor, at the start of an otherwise normal business day. One of the fired employees is Peter and Seth's boss, Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), head of risk management on the floor. Dale attempts to tell his now former employer that the firm should look into what he has been working on, but the contracted human resources staff have no interest other than him quickly leaving the building. While Dale is being escorted out, he gives Peter a USB memory stick with a project he had been working on, telling him to \"be careful\" just as he boards the elevator.\nThat night, Sullivan finishes Dale's project and discovers that current volatility in the firm's portfolio of mortgage-backed securities will soon exceed the historical volatility levels of the positions. Because of excessive leverage, if the firm's assets decrease by 25% in value, the firm will suffer a loss greater than its market capitalization. He also discovers that, given the normal length of time that the firm holds such securities, this loss must occur. Sullivan alerts Emerson, who calls floor head Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey).\nThese now key employees remain at the firm for a series of meetings with progressively more senior executives, including division head Jared Cohen (Simon Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), and finally CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons). Cohen's plan is for the firm to quickly sell all of the toxic assets before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure, a course favored by Tuld over Rogers's strong objection. Rogers warns Cohen and Tuld that dumping the firm's toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and will destroy the firm's relationships with its counterparties. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans, once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities.\nThey finally locate Dale, who had been missing after service to his company phone was deactivated. He has been persuaded to come in with the promise of a generous fee and the threat of having his severance package challenged if he didn't. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld plans to offer Robertson's resignation to the board and employees as a scapegoat.\nBefore the markets open, Rogers tells his traders they will receive seven-figure bonuses if they achieve a 93% reduction in certain MBS asset classes in a \"fire sale\". He admits that the traders are effectively ending their careers by destroying their relationships with their clients. Meanwhile, Robertson and Dale sit in an office, being paid handsomely to do nothing for the day; Robertson vigorously defends herself that she warned of the risks although perhaps not loudly enough. Emerson keeps on closing the positions, but his counterparties become increasingly agitated and suspicious as the day wears on. After trading hours end, Rogers watches the same human resources team begin another round of layoffs on his floor. He confronts Tuld in the executive dining area and asks to resign, but Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is really no different from various crashes and bear markets of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the economic cycle. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Rogers notices Sullivan meeting with Cohen; Tuld informs Rogers he will promote Sullivan.\nIn the final scene, Rogers is shown in his ex-wife's front lawn late at night, burying his dog that has died of cancer\u00e2\u0080\u0094thinking that since the dog had spent most of its life there that it should be buried there. His ex-wife comes out and reminds him that he doesn't live there anymore. She reassures him that their son, who is implied to also work on Wall Street, took a hit from the day's trading but will be okay. As the credits roll, Rogers continues to dig.\n<html>\n<head><title>Margin Call Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Margin Call script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Margin Call script, Margin Call movie script, Margin Call film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He has a Doctorate from MIT\n    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer\n    screens.\n\n    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come\n    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down\n    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of\n    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into\n    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and\n    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling\n    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy\n    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his\n    early twenties.\n\n<b>                        SETH\n<\/b>              Is that them?\n\n<b>                           PETER\n<\/b>              (nods yes)\n\n<b>                        SETH\n<\/b>              Jesus Christ.\n\n    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large\n    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as\n    almost every person on the floor watches.\n\n                        SETH (cont'd)\n              Are they going to do it right there?\n\n<b>                           PETER\n<\/b>              Yeah.\n\n<b>                           SETH\n<\/b>              Fuck me.\n\n    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.\n\n<b>                        WILL EMERSON\n<\/b>                  (whispered)\n              Have you guys ever seen this before?\n\n<b>                           SETH\n<\/b>              No.\n\n<b>                        WILL EMERSON\n<\/b>              Best to just ignore it.

It is brutal. The camera follows one\n    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and\n    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS\n    then stops a bit down from them.\n\n<b>                           HEATHER\n<\/b>                 Timothy Singh?\n\n<b>                              TIMOTHY\n<\/b>                 Yes.\n\n<b>                           HEATHER\n<\/b>                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.\n\n    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with\n    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP\n    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost\n    back into the numbers on his computer screen.\n\n    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing\n    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer\n    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until\n    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and\n    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off\n    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.\n\n                              HEATHER (cont'd)\n                 Eric Dale?\n\n<b>                              PETER\n<\/b>                 Excuse me?\n\n<b>                              HEATHER\n<\/b>                 Eric Dale?\n\n<b>                              PETER\n<\/b>                 No.\n\n<b>                              HEATHER\n<\/b>                 Sorry?\n\n<b>                           PETER\n<\/b>                 I'm not Eric Dale.\n\n<b>                           HEATHER\n<\/b>                 Oh.
