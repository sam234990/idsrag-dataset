The\nsoldiers whom he had commanded in Sicily were having a great feast to\ncelebrate the anniversary of the battle of Eryx, and as the master was\naway, and they were numerous, they ate and drank with perfect freedom.\n\nThe captains, who wore bronze cothurni, had placed themselves in the\ncentral path, beneath a gold-fringed purple awning, which reached from\nthe wall of the stables to the first terrace of the palace; the common\nsoldiers were scattered beneath the trees, where numerous flat-roofed\nbuildings might be seen, wine-presses, cellars, storehouses, bakeries,\nand arsenals, with a court for elephants, dens for wild beasts, and a\nprison for slaves.\n\nFig-trees surrounded the kitchens; a wood of sycamores stretched away to\nmeet masses of verdure, where the pomegranate shone amid the white tufts\nof the cotton-plant; vines, grape-laden, grew up into the branches of\nthe pines; a field of roses bloomed beneath the plane-trees; here and\nthere lilies rocked upon the turf; the paths were strewn with black sand\nmingled with powdered coral, and in the centre the avenue of cypress\nformed, as it were, a double colonnade of green obelisks from one\nextremity to the other.\n\nFar in the background stood the palace, built of yellow mottled Numidian\nmarble, broad courses supporting its four terraced stories. With its\nlarge, straight, ebony staircase, bearing the prow of a vanquished\ngalley at the corners of every step, its red doors quartered with black\ncrosses, its brass gratings protecting it from scorpions below, and its\ntrellises of gilded rods closing the apertures above, it seemed to the\nsoldiers in its haughty opulence as solemn and impenetrable as the face\nof Hamilcar.\n\nThe Council had appointed his house for the holding of this feast; the\nconvalescents lying in the temple of Eschmoun had set out at daybreak\nand dragged themselves thither on their crutches. Every minute others\nwere arriving. They poured in ceaselessly by every path like torrents\nrushing into a lake; through the trees the slaves of the kitchens might\nbe seen running scared and half-naked; the gazelles fled bleating on the\nlawns; the sun was setting, and the perfume of citron trees rendered the\nexhalation from the perspiring crowd heavier still.\n\nMen of all nations were there, Ligurians, Lusitanians, Balearians,\nNegroes, and fugitives from Rome. Beside the heavy Dorian dialect were\naudible the resonant Celtic syllables rattling like chariots of war,\nwhile Ionian terminations conflicted with consonants of the desert as\nharsh as the jackal's cry. The Greek might be recognised by his slender\nfigure, the Egyptian by his elevated shoulders, the Cantabrian by his\nbroad calves. There were Carians proudly nodding their helmet plumes,\nCappadocian archers displaying large flowers painted on their bodies\nwith the juice of herbs, and a few Lydians in women's robes, dining in\nslippers and earrings. Others were ostentatiously daubed with vermilion,\nand resembled coral statues.\n\nThey stretched themselves on the cushions, they ate squatting round\nlarge trays, or lying face downwards they drew out the pieces of meat\nand sated themselves, leaning on their elbows in the peaceful posture\nof lions tearing their prey. The last comers stood leaning against the\ntrees watching the low tables half hidden beneath the scarlet coverings,\nand awaiting their turn.\n\nHamilcar's kitchens being insufficient, the Council had sent them\nslaves, ware, and beds, and in the middle of the garden, as on a\nbattle-field when they burn the dead, large bright fires might be seen,\nat which oxen were roasting. Anise-sprinkled loaves alternated with\ngreat cheeses heavier than discuses, crateras filled with wine,\nand cantharuses filled with water, together with baskets of gold\nfiligree-work containing flowers. Every eye was dilated with the joy of\nbeing able at last to gorge at pleasure, and songs were beginning here\nand there.\n\nFirst they were served with birds and green sauce in plates of red clay\nrelieved by drawings in black, then with every kind of shell-fish that\nis gathered on the Punic coasts, wheaten porridge, beans and barley, and\nsnails dressed with cumin on dishes of yellow amber.\n\nAfterwards the tables were covered with meats, antelopes with their\nhorns, peacocks with their feathers, whole sheep cooked in sweet wine,\nhaunches of she-camels and buffaloes, hedgehogs with garum, fried\ngrasshoppers, and preserved dormice. Large pieces of fat floated in the\nmidst of saffron in bowls of Tamrapanni wood. Everything was running\nover with wine, truffles, and asafoetida. Pyramids of fruit were\ncrumbling upon honeycombs, and they had not forgotten a few of those\nplump little dogs with pink silky hair and fattened on olive lees,--a\nCarthaginian dish held in abhorrence among other nations. Surprise at\nthe novel fare excited the greed of the stomach. The Gauls with\ntheir long hair drawn up on the crown of the head, snatched at the\nwater-melons and lemons, and crunched them up with the rind. The\nNegroes, who had never seen a lobster, tore their faces with its red\nprickles. But the shaven Greeks, whiter than marble, threw the leavings\nof their plates behind them, while the herdsmen from Brutium, in their\nwolf-skin garments, devoured in silence with their faces in their\nportions.\n\nNight fell. The velarium, spread over the cypress avenue, was drawn\nback, and torches were brought.\n\nThe apes, sacred to the moon, were terrified on the cedar tops by the\nwavering lights of the petroleum as it burned in the porphyry vases.\nThey uttered screams which afforded mirth to the soldiers.\n\nOblong flames trembled in cuirasses of brass. Every kind of\nscintillation flashed from the gem-incrusted dishes. The crateras with\ntheir borders of convex mirrors multiplied and enlarged the images of\nthings; the soldiers thronged around, looking at their reflections with\namazement, and grimacing to make themselves laugh. They tossed the ivory\nstools and golden spatulas to one another across the tables. They gulped\ndown all the Greek wines in their leathern bottles, the Campanian wine\nenclosed in amphoras, the Cantabrian wines brought in casks, with the\nwines of the jujube, cinnamomum and lotus. There were pools of these on\nthe ground that made the foot slip. The smoke of the meats ascended into\nthe foliage with the vapour of the breath. Simultaneously were heard\nthe snapping of jaws, the noise of speech, songs, and cups, the crash of\nCampanian vases shivering into a thousand pieces, or the limpid sound of\na large silver dish.\n\nIn proportion as their intoxication increased they more and more\nrecalled the injustice of Carthage. The Republic, in fact, exhausted by\nthe war, had allowed all the returning bands to accumulate in the town.\nGisco, their general, had however been prudent enough to send them back\nseverally in order to facilitate the liquidation of their pay, and\nthe Council had believed that they would in the end consent to some\nreduction. But at present ill-will was caused by the inability to pay\nthem. This debt was confused in the minds of the people with the 3200\nEuboic talents exacted by Lutatius, and equally with Rome they were\nregarded as enemies to Carthage. The Mercenaries understood this, and\ntheir indignation found vent in threats and outbreaks. At last they\ndemanded permission to assemble to celebrate one of their victories,\nand the peace party yielded, at the same time revenging themselves on\nHamilcar who had so strongly upheld the war. It had been terminated\nnotwithstanding all his efforts, so that, despairing of Carthage, he\nhad entrusted the government of the Mercenaries to Gisco. To appoint his\npalace for their reception was to draw upon him something of the hatred\nwhich was borne to them. Moreover, the expense must be excessive, and he\nwould incur nearly the whole.\n\nProud of having brought the Republic to submit, the Mercenaries thought\nthat they were at last about to return to their homes with the payment\nfor their blood in the hoods of their cloaks. But as seen through the\nmists of intoxication, their fatigues seemed to them prodigious and but\nill-rewarded. They showed one another their wounds, they told of their\ncombats, their travels and the hunting in their native lands. They\nimitated the cries and the leaps of wild beasts. Then came unclean\nwagers; they buried their heads in the amphoras and drank on without\ninterruption, like thirsty dromedaries. A Lusitanian of gigantic stature\nran over the tables, carrying a man in each hand at arm's length, and\nspitting out fire through his nostrils. Some Lacedaemonians, who had not\ntaken off their cuirasses, were leaping with a heavy step. Some advanced\nlike women, making obscene gestures; others stripped naked to fight amid\nthe cups after the fashion of gladiators, and a company of Greeks danced\naround a vase whereon nymphs were to be seen, while a Negro tapped with\nan ox-bone on a brazen buckler.\n\nSuddenly they heard a plaintive song, a song loud and soft, rising and\nfalling in the air like the wing-beating of a wounded bird.\n\nIt was the voice of the slaves in the ergastulum. Some soldiers rose at\na bound to release them and disappeared.\n\nThey returned, driving through the dust amid shouts, twenty men,\ndistinguished by their greater paleness of face. Small black felt caps\nof conical shape covered their shaven heads; they all wore wooden shoes,\nand yet made a noise as of old iron like driving chariots.\n\nThey reached the avenue of cypress, where they were lost among the crowd\nof those questioning them. One of them remained apart, standing. Through\nthe rents in his tunic his shoulders could be seen striped with long\nscars. Drooping his chin, he looked round him with distrust, closing his\neyelids somewhat against the dazzling light of the torches, but when\nhe saw that none of the armed men were unfriendly to him, a great sigh\nescaped from his breast; he stammered, he sneered through the bright\ntears that bathed his face. At last he seized a brimming cantharus by\nits rings, raised it straight up into the air with his outstretched\narms, from which his chains hung down, and then looking to heaven, and\nstill holding the cup he said:\n\n\"Hail first to thee, Baal-Eschmoun, the deliverer, whom the people of my\ncountry call Aesculapius! and to you, genii of the fountains, light,\nand woods! and to you, ye gods hidden beneath the mountains and in the\ncaverns of the earth! and to you, strong men in shining armour who have\nset me free!\"\n\nThen he let fall the cup and related his history. He was called\nSpendius. The Carthaginians had taken him in the battle of Aeginusae,\nand he thanked the Mercenaries once more in Greek, Ligurian and Punic;\nhe kissed their hands; finally, he congratulated them on the banquet,\nwhile expressing his surprise at not perceiving the cups of the Sacred\nLegion. These cups, which bore an emerald vine on each of their\nsix golden faces, belonged to a corps composed exclusively of young\npatricians of the tallest stature. They were a privilege, almost a\nsacerdotal distinction, and accordingly nothing among the treasures\nof the Republic was more coveted by the Mercenaries. They detested the\nLegion on this account, and some of them had been known to risk their\nlives for the inconceivable pleasure of drinking out of these cups.\n\nAccordingly they commanded that the cups should be brought. They were\nin the keeping of the Syssitia, companies of traders, who had a common\ntable. The slaves returned. At that hour all the members of the Syssitia\nwere asleep.\n\n\"Let them be awakened!\" responded the Mercenaries.\n\nAfter a second excursion it was explained to them that the cups were\nshut up in a temple.\n\n\"Let it be opened!\" they replied.\n\nAnd when the slaves confessed with trembling that they were in the\npossession of Gisco, the general, they cried out:\n\n\"Let him bring them!\"\n\nGisco soon appeared at the far end of the garden with an escort of the\nSacred Legion. His full, black cloak, which was fastened on his head to\na golden mitre starred with precious stones, and which hung all about\nhim down to his horse's hoofs, blended in the distance with the colour\nof the night. His white beard, the radiancy of his head-dress, and his\ntriple necklace of broad blue plates beating against his breast, were\nalone visible.\n\nWhen he entered, the soldiers greeted him with loud shouts, all crying:\n\n\"The cups! The cups!\"\n\nHe began by declaring that if reference were had to their courage, they\nwere worthy of them.\n\nThe crowd applauded and howled with joy.\n\nHE knew it, he who had commanded them over yonder, and had returned with\nthe last cohort in the last galley!\n\n\"True! True!\" said they.\n\nNevertheless, Gisco continued, the Republic had respected their national\ndivisions, their customs, and their modes of worship; in Carthage\nthey were free! As to the cups of the Sacred Legion, they were private\nproperty. Suddenly a Gaul, who was close to Spendius, sprang over the\ntables and ran straight up to Gisco, gesticulating and threatening him\nwith two naked swords.\n\nWithout interrupting his speech, the General struck him on the head with\nhis heavy ivory staff, and the Barbarian fell. The Gauls howled, and\ntheir frenzy, which was spreading to the others, would soon have swept\naway the legionaries. Gisco shrugged his shoulders as he saw them\ngrowing pale. He thought that his courage would be useless against these\nexasperated brute beasts. It would be better to revenge himself upon\nthem by some artifice later; accordingly, he signed to his soldiers and\nslowly withdrew. Then, turning in the gateway towards the Mercenaries,\nhe cried to them that they would repent of it.\n\nThe feast recommenced. But Gisco might return, and by surrounding the\nsuburb, which was beside the last ramparts, might crush them against the\nwalls. Then they felt themselves alone in spite of their crowd, and the\ngreat town sleeping beneath them in the shade suddenly made them afraid,\nwith its piles of staircases, its lofty black houses, and its vague gods\nfiercer even than its people. In the distance a few ships'-lanterns\nwere gliding across the harbour, and there were lights in the temple of\nKhamon. They thought of Hamilcar. Where was he? Why had he forsaken\nthem when peace was concluded? His differences with the Council were\ndoubtless but a pretence in order to destroy them. Their unsatisfied\nhate recoiled upon him, and they cursed him, exasperating one another\nwith their own anger. At this juncture they collected together beneath\nthe plane-trees to see a slave who, with eyeballs fixed, neck contorted,\nand lips covered with foam, was rolling on the ground, and beating the\nsoil with his limbs. Some one cried out that he was poisoned. All then\nbelieved themselves poisoned. They fell upon the slaves, a terrible\nclamour was raised, and a vertigo of destruction came like a whirlwind\nupon the drunken army. They struck about them at random, they smashed,\nthey slew; some hurled torches into the foliage; others, leaning over\nthe lions' balustrade, massacred the animals with arrows; the most\ndaring ran to the elephants, desiring to cut down their trunks and eat\nivory.\n\nSome Balearic slingers, however, who had gone round the corner of the\npalace, in order to pillage more conveniently, were checked by a lofty\nbarrier, made of Indian cane. They cut the lock-straps with their\ndaggers, and then found themselves beneath the front that faced\nCarthage, in another garden full of trimmed vegetation. Lines of white\nflowers all following one another in regular succession formed long\nparabolas like star-rockets on the azure-coloured earth. The gloomy\nbushes exhaled warm and honied odours. There were trunks of trees\nsmeared with cinnabar, which resembled columns covered with blood. In\nthe centre were twelve pedestals, each supporting a great glass ball,\nand these hollow globes were indistinctly filled with reddish lights,\nlike enormous and still palpitating eyeballs. The soldiers lighted\nthemselves with torches as they stumbled on the slope of the deeply\nlaboured soil.\n\nBut they perceived a little lake divided into several basins by walls\nof blue stones. So limpid was the wave that the flames of the torches\nquivered in it at the very bottom, on a bed of white pebbles and golden\ndust. It began to bubble, luminous spangles glided past, and great fish\nwith gems about their mouths, appeared near the surface.\n\nWith much laughter the soldiers slipped their fingers into the gills and\nbrought them to the tables. They were the fish of the Barca family, and\nwere all descended from those primordial lotes which had hatched the\nmystic egg wherein the goddess was concealed. The idea of committing\na sacrilege revived the greediness of the Mercenaries; they speedily\nplaced fire beneath some brazen vases, and amused themselves by watching\nthe beautiful fish struggling in the boiling water.\n\nThe surge of soldiers pressed on. They were no longer afraid. They\ncommenced to drink again. Their ragged tunics were wet with the perfumes\nthat flowed in large drops from their foreheads, and resting both fists\non the tables, which seemed to them to be rocking like ships, they\nrolled their great drunken eyes around to devour by sight what they\ncould not take. Others walked amid the dishes on the purple table\ncovers, breaking ivory stools, and phials of Tyrian glass to pieces with\ntheir feet. Songs mingled with the death-rattle of the slaves expiring\namid the broken cups. They demanded wine, meat, gold. They cried out for\nwomen. They raved in a hundred languages. Some thought that they were at\nthe vapour baths on account of the steam which floated around them,\nor else, catching sight of the foliage, imagined that they were at\nthe chase, and rushed upon their companions as upon wild beasts. The\nconflagration spread to all the trees, one after another, and the lofty\nmosses of verdure, emitting long white spirals, looked like volcanoes\nbeginning to smoke. The clamour redoubled; the wounded lions roared in\nthe shade.\n\nIn an instant the highest terrace of the palace was illuminated, the\ncentral door opened, and a woman, Hamilcar's daughter herself, clothed\nin black garments, appeared on the threshold. She descended the first\nstaircase, which ran obliquely along the first story, then the second,\nand the third, and stopped on the last terrace at the head of the galley\nstaircase. Motionless and with head bent, she gazed upon the soldiers.\n\nBehind her, on each side, were two long shadows of pale men, clad in\nwhite, red-fringed robes, which fell straight to their feet. They had no\nbeard, no hair, no eyebrows. In their hands, which sparkled with rings,\nthey carried enormous lyres, and with shrill voice they sang a hymn to\nthe divinity of Carthage. They were the eunuch priests of the temple of\nTanith, who were often summoned by Salammbo to her house.\n\nAt last she descended the galley staircase. The priests followed her.\nShe advanced into the avenue of cypress, and walked slowly through the\ntables of the captains, who drew back somewhat as they watched her pass.\n\nHer hair, which was powdered with violet sand, and combined into the\nform of a tower, after the fashion of the Chanaanite maidens, added to\nher height. Tresses of pearls were fastened to her temples, and fell to\nthe corners of her mouth, which was as rosy as a half-open pomegranate.\nOn her breast was a collection of luminous stones, their variegation\nimitating the scales of the murena. Her arms were adorned with diamonds,\nand issued naked from her sleeveless tunic, which was starred with\nred flowers on a perfectly black ground. Between her ankles she wore a\ngolden chainlet to regulate her steps, and her large dark purple mantle,\ncut of an unknown material, trailed behind her, making, as it were, at\neach step, a broad wave which followed her.\n\nThe priests played nearly stifled chords on their lyres from time to\ntime, and in the intervals of the music might be heard the tinkling of\nthe little golden chain, and the regular patter of her papyrus sandals.\n\nNo one as yet was acquainted with her. It was only known that she led a\nretired life, engaged in pious practices. Some soldiers had seen her in\nthe night on the summit of her palace kneeling before the stars amid the\neddyings from kindled perfuming-pans. It was the moon that had made her\nso pale, and there was something from the gods that enveloped her like a\nsubtle vapour. Her eyes seemed to gaze far beyond terrestrial space. She\nbent her head as she walked, and in her right hand she carried a little\nebony lyre.\n\nThey heard her murmur:\n\n\"Dead! All dead! No more will you come obedient to my voice as\nwhen, seated on the edge of the lake, I used to through seeds of the\nwatermelon into your mouths! The mystery of Tanith ranged in the depths\nof your eyes that were more limpid than the globules of rivers.\" And she\ncalled them by their names, which were those of the months--\"Siv! Sivan!\nTammouz, Eloul, Tischri, Schebar! Ah! have pity on me, goddess!\"\n\nThe soldiers thronged about her without understanding what she said.\nThey wondered at her attire, but she turned a long frightened look upon\nthem all, then sinking her head beneath her shoulders, and waving her\narms, she repeated several times:\n\n\"What have you done? what have you done?\n\n\"Yet you had bread, and meats and oil, and all the malobathrum of the\ngranaries for your enjoyment! I had brought oxen from Hecatompylos;\nI had sent hunters into the desert!\" Her voice swelled; her cheeks\npurpled. She added, \"Where, pray, are you now? In a conquered town,\nor in the palace of a master? And what master? Hamilcar the Suffet, my\nfather, the servant of the Baals! It was he who withheld from Lutatius\nthose arms of yours, red now with the blood of his slaves! Know you of\nany in your own lands more skilled in the conduct of battles? Look! our\npalace steps are encumbered with our victories! Ah! desist not! burn\nit! I will carry away with me the genius of my house, my black serpent\nslumbering up yonder on lotus leaves! I will whistle and he will follow\nme, and if I embark in a galley he will speed in the wake of my ship\nover the foam of the waves.\"\n\nHer delicate nostrils were quivering. She crushed her nails against the\ngems on her bosom. Her eyes drooped, and she resumed:\n\n\"Ah! poor Carthage! lamentable city! No longer hast thou for thy\nprotection the strong men of former days who went beyond the oceans to\nbuild temples on their shores. All the lands laboured about thee, and\nthe sea-plains, ploughed by thine oars, rocked with thy harvests.\" Then\nshe began to sing the adventures of Melkarth, the god of the Sidonians,\nand the father of her family.\n\nShe told of the ascent of the mountains of Ersiphonia, the journey to\nTartessus, and the war against Masisabal to avenge the queen of the\nserpents:\n\n\"He pursued the female monster, whose tail undulated over the dead\nleaves like a silver brook, into the forest, and came to a plain where\nwomen with dragon-croups were round a great fire, standing erect on the\npoints of their tails. The blood-coloured moon was shining within a\npale circle, and their scarlet tongues, cloven like the harpoons of\nfishermen, reached curling forth to the very edge of the flame.\"\n\nThen Salammbo, without pausing, related how Melkarth, after vanquishing\nMasisabal, placed her severed head on the prow of his ship. \"At each\nthrob of the waves it sank beneath the foam, but the sun embalmed it; it\nbecame harder than gold; nevertheless the eyes ceased not to weep, and\nthe tears fell into the water continually.\"\n\nShe sang all this in an old Chanaanite idiom, which the Barbarians did\nnot understand. They asked one another what she could be saying to them\nwith those frightful gestures which accompanied her speech, and mounted\nround about her on the tables, beds, and sycamore boughs, they strove\nwith open mouths and craned necks to grasp the vague stories hovering\nbefore their imaginations, through the dimness of the theogonies, like\nphantoms wrapped in cloud.\n\nOnly the beardless priests understood Salammbo; their wrinkled hands,\nwhich hung over the strings of their lyres, quivered, and from time\nto time they would draw forth a mournful chord; for, feebler than old\nwomen, they trembled at once with mystic emotion, and with the\nfear inspired by men. The Barbarians heeded them not, but listened\ncontinually to the maiden's song.\n\nNone gazed at her like a young Numidian chief, who was placed at\nthe captains' tables among soldiers of his own nation. His girdle so\nbristled with darts that it formed a swelling in his ample cloak,\nwhich was fastened on his temples with a leather lace. The cloth parted\nasunder as it fell upon his shoulders, and enveloped his countenance in\nshadow, so that only the fires of his two fixed eyes could be seen. It\nwas by chance that he was at the feast, his father having domiciled him\nwith the Barca family, according to the custom by which kings used to\nsend their children into the households of the great in order to pave\nthe way for alliances; but Narr' Havas had lodged there fox six months\nwithout having hitherto seen Salammbo, and now, seated on his heels,\nwith his head brushing the handles of his javelins, he was watching her\nwith dilated nostrils, like a leopard crouching among the bamboos.\n\nOn the other side of the tables was a Libyan of colossal stature, and\nwith short black curly hair. He had retained only his military jacket,\nthe brass plates of which were tearing the purple of the couch. A\nnecklace of silver moons was tangled in his hairy breast. His face was\nstained with splashes of blood; he was leaning on his left elbow with a\nsmile on his large, open mouth.\n\nSalammbo had abandoned the sacred rhythm. With a woman's subtlety she\nwas simultaneously employing all the dialects of the Barbarians in order\nto appease their anger. To the Greeks she spoke Greek; then she turned\nto the Ligurians, the Campanians, the Negroes, and listening to her each\none found again in her voice the sweetness of his native land. She now,\ncarried away by the memories of Carthage, sang of the ancient battles\nagainst Rome; they applauded. She kindled at the gleaming of the naked\nswords, and cried aloud with outstretched arms. Her lyre fell, she was\nsilent; and, pressing both hands upon her heart, she remained for some\nminutes with closed eyelids enjoying the agitation of all these men.\n\nMatho, the Libyan, leaned over towards her. Involuntarily she approached\nhim, and impelled by grateful pride, poured him a long stream of wine\ninto a golden cup in order to conciliate the army.\n\n\"Drink!\" she said.\n\nHe took the cup, and was carrying it to his lips when a Gaul, the same\nthat had been hurt by Gisco, struck him on the shoulder, while in a\njovial manner he gave utterance to pleasantries in his native tongue.\nSpendius was not far off, and he volunteered to interpret them.\n\n\"Speak!\" said Matho.\n\n\"The gods protect you; you are going to become rich. When will the\nnuptials be?\"\n\n\"What nuptials?\"\n\n\"Yours! for with us,\" said the Gaul, \"when a woman gives drink to a\nsoldier, it means that she offers him her couch.\"\n\nHe had not finished when Narr' Havas, with a bound, drew a javelin from\nhis girdle, and, leaning his right foot upon the edge of the table,\nhurled it against Matho.\n\nThe javelin whistled among the cups, and piercing the Lybian's arm,\npinned it so firmly to the cloth, that the shaft quivered in the air.\n\nMatho quickly plucked it out; but he was weaponless and naked; at last\nhe lifted the over-laden table with both arms, and flung it against\nNarr' Havas into the very centre of the crowd that rushed between them.\nThe soldiers and Numidians pressed together so closely that they were\nunable to draw their swords. Matho advanced dealing great blows with his\nhead. When he raised it, Narr' Havas had disappeared. He sought for him\nwith his eyes. Salammbo also was gone.\n\nThen directing his looks to the palace he perceived the red door with\nthe black cross closing far above, and he darted away.\n\nThey saw him run between the prows of the galleys, and then reappear\nalong the three staircases until he reached the red door against which\nhe dashed his whole body. Panting, he leaned against the wall to keep\nhimself from falling.\n\nBut a man had followed him, and through the darkness, for the lights\nof the feast were hidden by the corner of the palace, he recognised\nSpendius.\n\n\"Begone!\" said he.\n\nThe slave without replying began to tear his tunic with his teeth;\nthen kneeling beside Matho he tenderly took his arm, and felt it in the\nshadow to discover the wound.\n\nBy a ray of the moon which was then gliding between the clouds, Spendius\nperceived a gaping wound in the middle of the arm. He rolled the piece\nof stuff about it, but the other said irritably, \"Leave me! leave me!\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" replied the slave. \"You released me from the ergastulum. I am\nyours! you are my master! command me!\"\n\nMatho walked round the terrace brushing against the walls. He strained\nhis ears at every step, glancing down into the silent apartments through\nthe spaces between the gilded reeds. At last he stopped with a look of\ndespair.\n\n\"Listen!\" said the slave to him. \"Oh! do not despise me for my\nfeebleness! I have lived in the palace. I can wind like a viper through\nthe walls. Come! in the Ancestor's Chamber there is an ingot of gold\nbeneath every flagstone; an underground path leads to their tombs.\"\n\n\"Well! what matters it?\" said Matho.\n\nSpendius was silent.\n\nThey were on the terrace. A huge mass of shadow stretched before them,\nappearing as if it contained vague accumulations, like the gigantic\nbillows of a black and petrified ocean.\n\nBut a luminous bar rose towards the East; far below, on the left, the\ncanals of Megara were beginning to stripe the verdure of the gardens\nwith their windings of white. The conical roofs of the heptagonal\ntemples, the staircases, terraces, and ramparts were being carved by\ndegrees upon the paleness of the dawn; and a girdle of white foam rocked\naround the Carthaginian peninsula, while the emerald sea appeared as if\nit were curdled in the freshness of the morning. Then as the rosy sky\ngrew larger, the lofty houses, bending over the sloping soil, reared\nand massed themselves like a herd of black goats coming down from the\nmountains. The deserted streets lengthened; the palm-trees that topped\nthe walls here and there were motionless; the brimming cisterns seemed\nlike silver bucklers lost in the courts; the beacon on the promontory of\nHermaeum was beginning to grow pale. The horses of Eschmoun, on the very\nsummit of the Acropolis in the cypress wood, feeling that the light was\ncoming, placed their hoofs on the marble parapet, and neighed towards\nthe sun.\n\nIt appeared, and Spendius raised his arms with a cry.\n\nEverything stirred in a diffusion of red, for the god, as if he were\nrending himself, now poured full-rayed upon Carthage the golden rain\nof his veins. The beaks of the galleys sparkled, the roof of Khamon\nappeared to be all in flames, while far within the temples, whose\ndoors were opening, glimmerings of light could be seen. Large chariots,\narriving from the country, rolled their wheels over the flagstones\nin the streets. Dromedaries, baggage-laden, came down the ramps.\nMoney-changers raised the pent-houses of their shops at the cross ways,\nstorks took to flight, white sails fluttered. In the wood of Tanith\nmight be heard the tabourines of the sacred courtesans, and the furnaces\nfor baking the clay coffins were beginning to smoke on the Mappalian\npoint.\n\nSpendius leaned over the terrace; his teeth chattered and he repeated:\n\n\"Ah! yes--yes--master! I understand why you scorned the pillage of the\nhouse just now.\"\n\nMatho was as if he had just been awaked by the hissing of his voice, and\ndid not seem to understand. Spendius resumed:\n\n\"Ah! what riches! and the men who possess them have not even the steel\nto defend them!\"\n\nThen, pointing with his right arm outstretched to some of the populace\nwho were crawling on the sand outside the mole to look for gold dust:\n\n\"See!\" he said to him, \"the Republic is like these wretches: bending on\nthe brink of the ocean, she buries her greedy arms in every shore, and\nthe noise of the billows so fills her ear that she cannot hear behind\nher the tread of a master's heel!\"\n\nHe drew Matho to quite the other end of the terrace, and showed him the\ngarden, wherein the soldiers' swords, hanging on the trees, were like\nmirrors in the sun.\n\n\"But here there are strong men whose hatred is roused! and nothing binds\nthem to Carthage, neither families, oaths nor gods!\"\n\nMatho remained leaning against the wall; Spendius came close, and\ncontinued in a low voice:\n\n\"Do you understand me, soldier? We should walk purple-clad like satraps.\nWe should bathe in perfumes; and I should in turn have slaves! Are you\nnot weary of sleeping on hard ground, of drinking the vinegar of the\ncamps, and of continually hearing the trumpet? But you will rest later,\nwill you not? When they pull off your cuirass to cast your corpse to\nthe vultures! or perhaps blind, lame, and weak you will go, leaning on\na stick, from door to door to tell of your youth to pickle-sellers and\nlittle children. Remember all the injustice of your chiefs, the campings\nin the snow, the marchings in the sun, the tyrannies of discipline, and\nthe everlasting menace of the cross! And after all this misery they have\ngiven you a necklace of honour, as they hang a girdle of bells round\nthe breast of an ass to deafen it on its journey, and prevent it from\nfeeling fatigue. A man like you, braver than Pyrrhus! If only you had\nwished it! Ah! how happy will you be in large cool halls, with the sound\nof lyres, lying on flowers, with women and buffoons! Do not tell me that\nthe enterprise is impossible. Have not the Mercenaries already possessed\nRhegium and other fortified places in Italy? Who is to prevent you?\nHamilcar is away; the people execrate the rich; Gisco can do nothing\nwith the cowards who surround him. Command them! Carthage is ours; let\nus fall upon it!\"\n\n\"No!\" said Matho, \"the curse of Moloch weighs upon me. I felt it in her\neyes, and just now I saw a black ram retreating in a temple.\" Looking\naround him he added: \"But where is she?\"\n\nThen Spendius understood that a great disquiet possessed him, and did\nnot venture to speak again.\n\nThe trees behind them were still smoking; half-burned carcases of apes\ndropped from their blackened boughs from time to time into the midst\nof the dishes. Drunken soldiers snored open-mouthed by the side of the\ncorpses, and those who were not asleep lowered their heads dazzled by\nthe light of day. The trampled soil was hidden beneath splashes of red.\nThe elephants poised their bleeding trunks between the stakes of their\npens. In the open granaries might be seen sacks of spilled wheat, below\nthe gate was a thick line of chariots which had been heaped up by the\nBarbarians, and the peacocks perched in the cedars were spreading their\ntails and beginning to utter their cry.\n\nMatho's immobility, however, astonished Spendius; he was even paler than\nhe had recently been, and he was following something on the horizon with\nfixed eyeballs, and with both fists resting on the edge of the terrace.\nSpendius crouched down, and so at last discovered at what he was gazing.\nIn the distance a golden speck was turning in the dust on the road to\nUtica; it was the nave of a chariot drawn by two mules; a slave was\nrunning at the end of the pole, and holding them by the bridle. Two\nwomen were seated in the chariot. The manes of the animals were puffed\nbetween the ears after the Persian fashion, beneath a network of blue\npearls. Spendius recognised them, and restrained a cry.\n\nA large veil floated behind in the wind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAT SICCA\n\nTwo days afterwards the Mercenaries left Carthage.\n\nThey had each received a piece of gold on the condition that they\nshould go into camp at Sicca, and they had been told with all sorts of\ncaresses:\n\n\"You are the saviours of Carthage! But you would starve it if you\nremained there; it would become insolvent. Withdraw! The Republic will\nbe grateful to you later for all this condescension. We are going to\nlevy taxes immediately; your pay shall be in full, and galleys shall be\nequipped to take you back to your native lands.\"\n\nThey did not know how to reply to all this talk. These men, accustomed\nas they were to war, were wearied by residence in a town; there was\ndifficulty in convincing them, and the people mounted the walls to see\nthem go away.\n\nThey defiled through the street of Khamon, and the Cirta gate,\npell-mell, archers with hoplites, captains with soldiers, Lusitanians\nwith Greeks. They marched with a bold step, rattling their heavy\ncothurni on the paving stones. Their armour was dented by the catapult,\nand their faces blackened by the sunburn of battles. Hoarse cries issued\nfrom their thick bears, their tattered coats of mail flapped upon the\npommels of their swords, and through the holes in the brass might be\nseen their naked limbs, as frightful as engines of war. Sarissae, axes,\nspears, felt caps and bronze helmets, all swung together with a single\nmotion. They filled the street thickly enough to have made the walls\ncrack, and the long mass of armed soldiers overflowed between the lofty\nbitumen-smeared houses six storys high. Behind their gratings of iron or\nreed the women, with veiled heads, silently watched the Barbarians pass.\n\nThe terraces, fortifications, and walls were hidden beneath the crowd\nof Carthaginians, who were dressed in garments of black. The sailors'\ntunics showed like drops of blood among the dark multitude, and nearly\nnaked children, whose skin shone beneath their copper bracelets,\ngesticulated in the foliage of the columns, or amid the branches of\na palm tree. Some of the Ancients were posted on the platform of the\ntowers, and people did not know why a personage with a long beard stood\nthus in a dreamy attitude here and there. He appeared in the distance\nagainst the background of the sky, vague as a phantom and motionless as\nstone.\n\nAll, however, were oppressed with the same anxiety; it was feared that\nthe Barbarians, seeing themselves so strong, might take a fancy to stay.\nBut they were leaving with so much good faith that the Carthaginians\ngrew bold and mingled with the soldiers. They overwhelmed them with\nprotestations and embraces. Some with exaggerated politeness and\naudacious hypocrisy even sought to induce them not to leave the city.\nThey threw perfumes, flowers, and pieces of silver to them. They gave\nthem amulets to avert sickness; but they had spit upon them three times\nto attract death, or had enclosed jackal's hair within them to put\ncowardice into their hearts. Aloud, they invoked Melkarth's favour, and\nin a whisper, his curse.\n\nThen came the mob of baggage, beasts of burden, and stragglers. The sick\ngroaned on the backs of dromedaries, while others limped along leaning\non broken pikes. The drunkards carried leathern bottles, and the greedy\nquarters of meat, cakes, fruits, butter wrapped in fig leaves, and snow\nin linen bags. Some were to be seen with parasols in their hands, and\nparrots on their shoulders. They had mastiffs, gazelles, and panthers\nfollowing behind them. Women of Libyan race, mounted on asses, inveighed\nagainst the Negresses who had forsaken the lupanaria of Malqua for the\nsoldiers; many of them were suckling children suspended on their bosoms\nby leathern thongs. The mules were goaded out at the point of the sword,\ntheir backs bending beneath the load of tents, while there were numbers\nof serving-men and water-carriers, emaciated, jaundiced with fever,\nand filthy with vermin, the scum of the Carthaginian populace, who had\nattached themselves to the Barbarians.\n\nWhen they had passed, the gates were shut behind them, but the people\ndid not descend from the walls. The army soon spread over the breadth of\nthe isthmus.\n\nIt parted into unequal masses. Then the lances appeared like tall blades\nof grass, and finally all was lost in a train of dust; those of the\nsoldiers who looked back towards Carthage could now only see its long\nwalls with their vacant battlements cut out against the edge of the sky.\n\nThen the Barbarians heard a great shout. They thought that some from\namong them (for they did not know their own number) had remained in the\ntown, and were amusing themselves by pillaging a temple. They laughed a\ngreat deal at the idea of this, and then continued their journey.\n\nThey were rejoiced to find themselves, as in former days, marching all\ntogether in the open country, and some of the Greeks sang the old song\nof the Mamertines:\n\n\"With my lance and sword I plough and reap; I am master of the house!\nThe disarmed man falls at my feet and calls me Lord and Great King.\"\n\nThey shouted, they leaped, the merriest began to tell stories; the\ntime of their miseries was past. As they arrived at Tunis, some of\nthem remarked that a troop of Balearic slingers was missing. They were\ndoubtless not far off; and no further heed was paid to them.\n\nSome went to lodge in the houses, others camped at the foot of the\nwalls, and the townspeople came out to chat with the soldiers.\n\nDuring the whole night fires were seen burning on the horizon in the\ndirection of Carthage; the light stretched like giant torches across the\nmotionless lake. No one in the army could tell what festival was being\ncelebrated.\n\nOn the following day the Barbarian's passed through a region that was\ncovered with cultivation. The domains of the patricians succeeded one\nanother along the border of the route; channels of water flowed\nthrough woods of palm; there were long, green lines of olive-trees;\nrose-coloured vapours floated in the gorges of the hills, while blue\nmountains reared themselves behind. A warm wind was blowing. Chameleons\nwere crawling on the broad leaves of the cactus.\n\nThe Barbarians slackened their speed.\n\nThey marched on in isolated detachments, or lagged behind one another at\nlong intervals. They ate grapes along the margin of the vines. They lay\non the grass and gazed with stupefaction upon the large, artificially\ntwisted horns of the oxen, the sheep clothed with skins to protect their\nwool, the furrows crossing one another so as to form lozenges, and the\nploughshares like ships' anchors, with the pomegranate trees that were\nwatered with silphium. Such wealth of the soil and such inventions of\nwisdom dazzled them.\n\nIn the evening they stretched themselves on the tents without unfolding\nthem; and thought with regret of Hamilcar's feast, as they fell asleep\nwith their faces towards the stars.\n\nIn the middle of the following day they halted on the bank of a river,\namid clumps of rose-bays. Then they quickly threw aside lances, bucklers\nand belts. They bathed with shouts, and drew water in their helmets,\nwhile others drank lying flat on their stomachs, and all in the midst of\nthe beasts of burden whose baggage was slipping from them.\n\nSpendius, who was seated on a dromedary stolen in Hamilcar's parks,\nperceived Matho at a distance, with his arm hanging against his breast,\nhis head bare, and his face bent down, giving his mule drink, and\nwatching the water flow. Spendius immediately ran through the crowd\ncalling him, \"Master! master!\"\n\nMatho gave him but scant thanks for his blessings, but Spendius paid no\nheed to this, and began to march behind him, from time to time turning\nrestless glances in the direction of Carthage.\n\nHe was the son of a Greek rhetor and a Campanian prostitute. He had at\nfirst grown rich by dealing in women; then, ruined by a shipwreck, he\nhad made war against the Romans with the herdsmen of Samnium. He had\nbeen taken and had escaped; he had been retaken, and had worked in the\nquarries, panted in the vapour-baths, shrieked under torture, passed\nthrough the hands of many masters, and experienced every frenzy. At\nlast, one day, in despair, he had flung himself into the sea from the\ntop of a trireme where he was working at the oar. Some of Hamilcar's\nsailors had picked him up when at the point of death, and had brought\nhim to the ergastulum of Megara, at Carthage. But, as fugitives were to\nbe given back to the Romans, he had taken advantage of the confusion to\nfly with the soldiers.\n\nDuring the whole of the march he remained near Matho; he brought him\nfood, assisted him to dismount, and spread a carpet in the evening\nbeneath his head. Matho at last was touched by these attentions, and by\ndegrees unlocked his lips.\n\nHe had been born in the gulf of Syrtis. His father had taken him on a\npilgrimage to the temple of Ammon. Then he had hunted elephants in the\nforests of the Garamantes. Afterwards he had entered the service of\nCarthage. He had been appointed tetrarch at the capture of Drepanum.\nThe Republic owed him four horses, twenty-three medimni of wheat, and a\nwinter's pay. He feared the gods, and wished to die in his native land.\n\nSpendius spoke to him of his travels, and of the peoples and temples\nthat he had visited. He knew many things: he could make sandals,\nboar-spears and nets; he could tame wild beasts and could cook fish.\n\nSometimes he would interrupt himself, and utter a hoarse cry from the\ndepths of his throat; Matho's mule would quicken his pace, and others\nwould hasten after them, and then Spendius would begin again though\nstill torn with agony. This subsided at last on the evening of the\nfourth day.\n\nThey were marching side by side to the right of the army on the side of\na hill; below them stretched the plain lost in the vapours of the night.\nThe lines of soldiers also were defiling below, making undulations in\nthe shade. From time to time these passed over eminences lit up by the\nmoon; then stars would tremble on the points of the pikes, the helmets\nwould glimmer for an instant, all would disappear, and others would come\non continually. Startled flocks bleated in the distance, and a something\nof infinite sweetness seemed to sink upon the earth.\n\nSpendius, with his head thrown back and his eyes half-closed, inhaled\nthe freshness of the wind with great sighs; he spread out his arms,\nmoving his fingers that he might the better feel the cares that streamed\nover his body. Hopes of vengeance came back to him and transported him.\nHe pressed his hand upon his mouth to check his sobs, and half-swooning\nwith intoxication, let go the halter of his dromedary, which was\nproceeding with long, regular steps. Matho had relapsed into his former\nmelancholy; his legs hung down to the ground, and the grass made a\ncontinuous rustling as it beat against his cothurni.\n\nThe journey, however, spread itself out without ever coming to an end.\nAt the extremity of a plain they would always reach a round-shaped\nplateau; then they would descend again into a valley, and the mountains\nwhich seemed to block up the horizon would, in proportion as they were\napproached, glide as it were from their positions. From time to time a\nriver would appear amid the verdure of tamarisks to lose itself at the\nturning of the hills. Sometimes a huge rock would tower aloft like the\nprow of a vessel or the pedestal of some vanished colossus.\n\nAt regular intervals they met with little quadrangular temples, which\nserved as stations for the pilgrims who repaired to Sicca. They were\nclosed like tombs. The Libyans struck great blows upon the doors to have\nthem opened. But no one inside responded.\n\nThen the cultivation became more rare. They suddenly entered upon belts\nof sand bristling with thorny thickets. Flocks of sheep were browsing\namong the stones; a woman with a blue fleece about her waist was\nwatching them. She fled screaming when she saw the soldiers' pikes among\nthe rocks.\n\nThey were marching through a kind of large passage bordered by two\nchains of reddish coloured hillocks, when their nostrils were greeted\nwith a nauseous odour, and they thought that they could see something\nextraordinary on the top of a carob tree: a lion's head reared itself\nabove the leaves.\n\nThey ran thither. It was a lion with his four limbs fastened to a cross\nlike a criminal. His huge muzzle fell upon his breast, and his two\nfore-paws, half-hidden beneath the abundance of his mane, were spread\nout wide like the wings of a bird. His ribs stood severally out beneath\nhis distended skin; his hind legs, which were nailed against each other,\nwere raised somewhat, and the black blood, flowing through his hair,\nhad collected in stalactites at the end of his tail, which hung down\nperfectly straight along the cross. The soldiers made merry around; they\ncalled him consul, and Roman citizen, and threw pebbles into his eyes to\ndrive away the gnats.\n\nBut a hundred paces further on they saw two more, and then there\nsuddenly appeared a long file of crosses bearing lions. Some had been\nso long dead that nothing was left against the wood but the remains\nof their skeletons; others which were half eaten away had their jaws\ntwisted into horrible grimaces; there were some enormous ones; the\nshafts of the crosses bent beneath them, and they swayed in the wind,\nwhile bands of crows wheeled ceaselessly in the air above their heads.\nIt was thus that the Carthaginian peasants avenged themselves when\nthey captured a wild beast; they hoped to terrify the others by such\nan example. The Barbarians ceased their laughter, and were long lost in\namazement. \"What people is this,\" they thought, \"that amuses itself by\ncrucifying lions!\"\n\nThey were, besides, especially the men of the North, vaguely uneasy,\ntroubled, and already sick. They tore their hands with the darts of the\naloes; great mosquitoes buzzed in their ears, and dysentry was breaking\nout in the army. They were weary at not yet seeing Sicca. They were\nafraid of losing themselves and of reaching the desert, the country of\nsands and terrors. Many even were unwilling to advance further. Others\nstarted back to Carthage.\n\nAt last on the seventh day, after following the base of a mountain for a\nlong time, they turned abruptly to the right, and there then appeared\na line of walls resting on white rocks and blending with them. Suddenly\nthe entire city rose; blue, yellow, and white veils moved on the walls\nin the redness of the evening. These were the priestesses of Tanith,\nwho had hastened hither to receive the men. They stood ranged along the\nrampart, striking tabourines, playing lyres, and shaking crotala, while\nthe rays of the sun, setting behind them in the mountains of Numidia,\nshot between the strings of their lyres over which their naked arms were\nstretched. At intervals their instruments would become suddenly still,\nand a cry would break forth strident, precipitate, frenzied, continuous,\na sort of barking which they made by striking both corners of the mouth\nwith the tongue. Others, more motionless than the Sphynx, rested on\ntheir elbows with their chins on their hands, and darted their great\nblack eyes upon the army as it ascended.\n\nAlthough Sicca was a sacred town it could not hold such a multitude; the\ntemple alone, with its appurtenances, occupied half of it. Accordingly\nthe Barbarians established themselves at their ease on the plain;\nthose who were disciplined in regular troops, and the rest according to\nnationality or their own fancy.\n\nThe Greeks ranged their tents of skin in parallel lines; the Iberians\nplaced their canvas pavilions in a circle; the Gauls made themselves\nhuts of planks; the Libyans cabins of dry stones, while the Negroes with\ntheir nails hollowed out trenches in the sand to sleep in. Many, not\nknowing where to go, wandered about among the baggage, and at nightfall\nlay down in their ragged mantles on the ground.\n\nThe plain, which was wholly bounded by mountains, expanded around them.\nHere and there a palm tree leaned over a sand hill, and pines and oaks\nflecked the sides of the precipices: sometimes the rain of a storm would\nhang from the sky like a long scarf, while the country everywhere was\nstill covered with azure and serenity; then a warm wind would drive\nbefore it tornadoes of dust, and a stream would descend in cascades from\nthe heights of Sicca, where, with its roofing of gold on its columns of\nbrass, rose the temple of the Carthaginian Venus, the mistress of the\nland. She seemed to fill it with her soul. In such convulsions of the\nsoil, such alternations of temperature, and such plays of light would\nshe manifest the extravagance of her might with the beauty of her\neternal smile. The mountains at their summits were crescent-shaped;\nothers were like women's bosoms presenting their swelling breasts, and\nthe Barbarians felt a heaviness that was full of delight weighing down\ntheir fatigues.\n\nSpendius had bought a slave with the money brought him by his dromedary.\nThe whole day long he lay asleep stretched before Matho's tent. Often he\nwould awake, thinking in his dreams that he heard the whistling of the\nthongs; with a smile he would pass his hands over the scars on his legs\nat the place where the fetters had long been worn, and then he would\nfall asleep again.\n\nMatho accepted his companionship, and when he went out Spendius would\nescort him like a lictor with a long sword on his thigh; or perhaps\nMatho would rest his arm carelessly on the other's shoulder, for\nSpendius was small.\n\nOne evening when they were passing together through the streets in the\ncamp they perceived some men covered with white cloaks; among them was\nNarr' Havas, the prince of the Numidians. Matho started.\n\n\"Your sword!\" he cried; \"I will kill him!\"\n\n\"Not yet!\" said Spendius, restraining him. Narr' Havas was already\nadvancing towards him.\n\nHe kissed both thumbs in token of alliance, showing nothing of the anger\nwhich he had experienced at the drunkenness of the feast; then he spoke\nat length against Carthage, but did not say what brought him among the\nBarbarians.\n\n\"Was it to betray them, or else the Republic?\" Spendius asked himself;\nand as he expected to profit by every disorder, he felt grateful to\nNarr' Havas for the future perfidies of which he suspected him.\n\nThe chief of the Numidians remained amongst the Mercenaries. He appeared\ndesirous of attaching Matho to himself. He sent him fat goats, gold\ndust, and ostrich feathers. The Libyan, who was amazed at such caresses,\nwas in doubt whether to respond to them or to become exasperated at\nthem. But Spendius pacified him, and Matho allowed himself to be ruled\nby the slave, remaining ever irresolute and in an unconquerable torpor,\nlike those who have once taken a draught of which they are to die.\n\nOne morning when all three went out lion-hunting, Narr' Havas concealed\na dagger in his cloak. Spendius kept continually behind him, and when\nthey returned the dagger had not been drawn.\n\nAnother time Narr' Havas took them a long way off, as far as the\nboundaries of his kingdom. They came to a narrow gorge, and Narr' Havas\nsmiled as he declared that he had forgotten the way. Spendius found it\nagain.\n\nBut most frequently Matho would go off at sunrise, as melancholy as\nan augur, to wander about the country. He would stretch himself on the\nsand, and remain there motionless until the evening.\n\nHe consulted all the soothsayers in the army one after the other,--those\nwho watch the trail of serpents, those who read the stars, and those who\nbreathe upon the ashes of the dead. He swallowed galbanum, seseli, and\nviper's venom which freezes the heart; Negro women, singing barbarous\nwords in the moonlight, pricked the skin of his forehead with golden\nstylets; he loaded himself with necklaces and charms; he invoked in\nturn Baal-Khamon, Moloch, the seven Kabiri, Tanith, and the Venus of\nthe Greeks. He engraved a name upon a copper plate, and buried it in the\nsand at the threshold of his tent. Spendius used to hear him groaning\nand talking to himself.\n\nOne night he went in.\n\nMatho, as naked as a corpse, was lying on a lion's skin flat on his\nstomach, with his face in both his hands; a hanging lamp lit up his\narmour, which was hooked on to the tent-pole above his head.\n\n\"You are suffering?\" said the slave to him. \"What is the matter with\nyou? Answer me?\" And he shook him by the shoulder calling him several\ntimes, \"Master! master!\"\n\nAt last Matho lifted large troubled eyes towards him.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said in a low voice, and with a finger on his lips. \"It is\nthe wrath of the Gods! Hamilcar's daughter pursues me! I am afraid of\nher, Spendius!\" He pressed himself close against his breast like a child\nterrified by a phantom. \"Speak to me! I am sick! I want to get well! I\nhave tried everything! But you, you perhaps know some stronger gods, or\nsome resistless invocation?\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\" asked Spendius.\n\nStriking his head with both his fists, he replied:\n\n\"To rid me of her!\"\n\nThen speaking to himself with long pauses he said:\n\n\"I am no doubt the victim of some holocaust which she has promised to\nthe gods?--She holds me fast by a chain which people cannot see. If I\nwalk, it is she that is advancing; when I stop, she is resting! Her eyes\nburn me, I hear her voice. She encompasses me, she penetrates me. It\nseems to me that she has become my soul!\n\n\"And yet between us there are, as it were, the invisible billows of a\nboundless ocean! She is far away and quite inaccessible! The splendour\nof her beauty forms a cloud of light around her, and at times I think\nthat I have never seen her--that she does not exist--and that it is all\na dream!\"\n\nMatho wept thus in the darkness; the Barbarians were sleeping. Spendius,\nas he looked at him, recalled the young men who once used to entreat\nhim with golden cases in their hands, when he led his herd of courtesans\nthrough the towns; a feeling of pity moved him, and he said--\n\n\"Be strong, my master! Summon your will, and beseech the gods no more,\nfor they turn not aside at the cries of men! Weeping like a coward! And\nyou are not humiliated that a woman can cause you so much suffering?\"\n\n\"Am I a child?\" said Matho. \"Do you think that I am moved by their faces\nand songs? We kept them at Drepanum to sweep out our stables. I have\nembraced them amid assaults, beneath falling ceilings, and while the\ncatapult was still vibrating!--But she, Spendius, she!--\"\n\nThe slave interrupted him:\n\n\"If she were not Hanno's daughter--\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Matho. \"She has nothing in common with the daughters of\nother men! Have you seen her great eyes beneath her great eyebrows, like\nsuns beneath triumphal arches? Think: when she appeared all the torches\ngrew pale. Her naked breast shone here and there through the diamonds of\nher necklace; behind her you perceived as it were the odour of a temple,\nand her whole being emitted something that was sweeter than wine and\nmore terrible than death. She walked, however, and then she stopped.\"\n\nHe remained gaping with his head cast down and his eyeballs fixed.\n\n\"But I want her! I need her! I am dying for her! I am transported with\nfrenzied joy at the thought of clasping her in my arms, and yet I hate\nher, Spendius! I should like to beat her! What is to be done? I have a\nmind to sell myself and become her slave! YOU have been that! You were\nable to get sight of her; speak to me of her! Every night she ascends\nto the terrace of her palace, does she not? Ah! the stones must quiver\nbeneath her sandals, and the stars bend down to see her!\"\n\nHe fell back in a perfect frenzy, with a rattling in his throat like a\nwounded bull.\n\nThen Matho sang: \"He pursued into the forest the female monster, whose\ntail undulated over the dead leaves like a silver brook.\" And with\nlingering tones he imitated Salammbo's voice, while his outspread hands\nwere held like two light hands on the strings of a lyre.\n\nTo all the consolations offered by Spendius, he repeated the same words;\ntheir nights were spent in these wailings and exhortations.\n\nMatho sought to drown his thoughts in wine. After his fits of\ndrunkenness he was more melancholy still. He tried to divert himself at\nhuckle-bones, and lost the gold plates of his necklace one by one. He\nhad himself taken to the servants of the Goddess; but he came down the\nhill sobbing, like one returning from a funeral.\n\nSpendius, on the contrary, became more bold and gay. He was to be seen\nin the leafy taverns discoursing in the midst of the soldiers. He mended\nold cuirasses. He juggled with daggers. He went and gathered herbs in\nthe fields for the sick. He was facetious, dexterous, full of invention\nand talk; the Barbarians grew accustomed to his services, and he came to\nbe loved by them.\n\nHowever, they were awaiting an ambassador from Carthage to bring\nthem mules laden with baskets of gold; and ever beginning the same\ncalculation over again, they would trace figures with their fingers in\nthe sand. Every one was arranging his life beforehand; they would have\nconcubines, slaves, lands; others intended to bury their treasure,\nor risk it on a vessel. But their tempers were provoked by want of\nemployment; there were constant disputes between horse-soldiers and\nfoot-soldiers, Barbarians and Greeks, while there was a never-ending din\nof shrill female voices.\n\nEvery day men came flocking in nearly naked, and with grass on their\nheads to protect them from the sun; they were the debtors of the rich\nCarthaginians and had been forced to till the lands of the latter, but\nhad escaped. Libyans came pouring in with peasants ruined by the taxes,\noutlaws, and malefactors. Then the horde of traders, all the dealers in\nwine and oil, who were furious at not being paid, laid the blame upon\nthe Republic. Spendius declaimed against it. Soon the provisions ran\nlow; and there was talk of advancing in a body upon Carthage, and\ncalling in the Romans.\n\nOne evening, at supper-time, dull cracked sounds were heard approaching,\nand something red appeared in the distance among the undulations of the\nsoil.\n\nIt was a large purple litter, adorned with ostrich feathers at the\ncorners. Chains of crystal and garlands of pearls beat against the\nclosed hangings. It was followed by camels sounding the great bells\nthat hung at their breasts, and having around them horsemen clad from\nshoulder to heel in armour of golden scales.\n\nThey halted three hundred paces from the camp to take their round\nbucklers, broad swords, and Boeotian helmets out of the cases which they\ncarried behind their saddles. Some remained with the camels, while\nthe others resumed their march. At last the ensigns of the Republic\nappeared, that is to say, staves of blue wood terminated in horses'\nheads or fir cones. The Barbarians all rose with applause; the women\nrushed towards the guards of the Legion and kissed their feet.\n\nThe litter advanced on the shoulders of twelve Negroes who walked in\nstep with short, rapid strides; they went at random to right or left,\nbeing embarrassed by the tent-ropes, the animals that were straying\nabout, or the tripods where food was being cooked. Sometimes a fat hand,\nladen with rings, would partially open the litter, and a hoarse voice\nwould utter loud reproaches; then the bearers would stop and take a\ndifferent direction through the camp.\n\nBut the purple curtains were raised, and a human head, impassible and\nbloated, was seen resting on a large pillow; the eyebrows, which were\nlike arches of ebony, met each other at the points; golden dust sparkled\nin the frizzled hair, and the face was so wan that it looked as if\nit had been powdered with marble raspings. The rest of the body was\nconcealed beneath the fleeces which filled the litter.\n\nIn the man so reclining the soldiers recognised the Suffet Hanno, he\nwhose slackness had assisted to lose the battle of the Aegatian islands;\nand as to his victory at Hecatompylos over the Libyans, even if he did\nbehave with clemency, thought the Barbarians, it was owing to cupidity,\nfor he had sold all the captives on his own account, although he had\nreported their deaths to the Republic.\n\nAfter seeking for some time a convenient place from which to harangue\nthe soldiers, he made a sign; the litter stopped, and Hanno, supported\nby two slaves, put his tottering feet to the ground.\n\nHe wore boots of black felt strewn with silver moons. His legs were\nswathed in bands like those wrapped about a mummy, and the flesh crept\nthrough the crossings of the linen; his stomach came out beyond the\nscarlet jacket which covered his thighs; the folds of his neck fell down\nto his breast like the dewlaps of an ox; his tunic, which was painted\nwith flowers, was bursting at the arm-pits; he wore a scarf, a girdle,\nand an ample black cloak with laced double-sleeves. But the abundance of\nhis garments, his great necklace of blue stones, his golden clasps, and\nheavy earrings only rendered his deformity still more hideous. He might\nhave been taken for some big idol rough-hewn in a block of stone; for\na pale leprosy, which was spread over his whole body, gave him the\nappearance of an inert thing. His nose, however, which was hooked like\na vulture's beak, was violently dilated to breathe in the air, and his\nlittle eyes, with their gummed lashes, shone with a hard and metallic\nlustre. He held a spatula of aloe-wood in his hand wherewith to scratch\nhis skin.\n\nAt last two heralds sounded their silver horns; the tumult subsided, and\nHanno commenced to speak.\n\nHe began with an eulogy of the gods and the Republic; the Barbarians\nought to congratulate themselves on having served it. But they must show\nthemselves more reasonable; times were hard, \"and if a master has only\nthree olives, is it not right that he should keep two for himself?\"\n\nThe old Suffet mingled his speech in this way with proverbs and\napologues, nodding his head the while to solicit some approval.\n\nHe spoke in Punic, and those surrounding him (the most alert, who\nhad hastened thither without their arms), were Campanians, Gauls, and\nGreeks, so that no one in the crowd understood him. Hanno, perceiving\nthis, stopped and reflected, swaying himself heavily from one leg to the\nother.\n\nIt occurred to him to call the captains together; then his heralds\nshouted the order in Greek, the language which, from the time of\nXanthippus, had been used for commands in the Carthaginian armies.\n\nThe guards dispersed the mob of soldiers with strokes of the whip; and\nthe captains of the Spartan phalanxes and the chiefs of the Barbarian\ncohorts soon arrived with the insignia of their rank, and in the\narmour of their nation. Night had fallen, a great tumult was spreading\nthroughout the plain; fires were burning here and there; and the\nsoldiers kept going from one to another asking what the matter was, and\nwhy the Suffet did not distribute the money?\n\nHe was setting the infinite burdens of the Republic before the captains.\nHer treasury was empty. The tribute to Rome was crushing her. \"We are\nquite at a loss what to do! She is much to be pitied!\"\n\nFrom time to time he would rub his limbs with his aloe-wood spatula,\nor perhaps he would break off to drink a ptisan made of the ashes of a\nweasel and asparagus boiled in vinegar from a silver cup handed to\nhim by a slave; then he would wipe his lips with a scarlet napkin and\nresume:\n\n\"What used to be worth a shekel of silver is now worth three shekels\nof gold, while the cultivated lands which were abandoned during the war\nbring in nothing! Our purpura fisheries are nearly gone, and even pearls\nare becoming exhorbitant; we have scarcely unguents enough for the\nservice of the gods! As for the things of the table, I shall say nothing\nabout them; it is a calamity! For want of galleys we are without spices,\nand it is a matter of great difficulty to procure silphium on account\nof the rebellions on the Cyrenian frontier. Sicily, where so many slaves\nused to be had, is now closed to us! Only yesterday I gave more money\nfor a bather and four scullions than I used at one time to give for a\npair of elephants!\"\n\nHe unrolled a long piece of papyrus; and, without omitting a single\nfigure, read all the expenses that the government had incurred; so much\nfor repairing the temples, for paving the streets, for the construction\nof vessels, for the coral-fisheries, for the enlargement of the\nSyssitia, and for engines in the mines in the country of the\nCantabrians.\n\nBut the captains understood Punic as little as the soldiers, although\nthe Mercenaries saluted one another in that language. It was usual to\nplace a few Carthaginian officers in the Barbarian armies to act as\ninterpreters; after the war they had concealed themselves through fear\nof vengeance, and Hanno had not thought of taking them with him; his\nhollow voice, too, was lost in the wind.\n\nThe Greeks, girthed in their iron waist-belts, strained their ears as\nthey strove to guess at his words, while the mountaineers, covered with\nfurs like bears, looked at him with distrust, or yawned as they leaned\non their brass-nailed clubs. The heedless Gauls sneered as they\nshook their lofty heads of hair, and the men of the desert listened\nmotionless, cowled in their garments of grey wool; others kept coming up\nbehind; the guards, crushed by the mob, staggered on their horses;\nthe Negroes held out burning fir branches at arm's length; and the big\nCarthaginian, mounted on a grassy hillock, continued his harangue.\n\nThe Barbarians, however, were growing impatient; murmuring arose, and\nevery one apostrophized him. Hanno gesticulated with his spatula; and\nthose who wished the others to be quiet shouted still more loudly,\nthereby adding to the din.\n\nSuddenly a man of mean appearance bounded to Hanno's feet, snatched up\na herald's trumpet, blew it, and Spendius (for it was he) announced that\nhe was going to say something of importance. At this declaration, which\nwas rapidly uttered in five different languages, Greek, Latin, Gallic,\nLibyan and Balearic, the captains, half laughing and half surprised,\nreplied: \"Speak! Speak!\"\n\nSpendius hesitated; he trembled; at last, addressing the Libyans who\nwere the most numerous, he said to them:\n\n\"You have all heard this man's horrible threats!\"\n\nHanno made no exclamation, therefore he did not understand Libyan; and,\nto carry on the experiment, Spendius repeated the same phrase in the\nother Barbarian dialects.\n\nThey looked at one another in astonishment; then, as by a tacit\nagreement, and believing perhaps that they had understood, they bent\ntheir heads in token of assent.\n\nThen Spendius began in vehement tones:\n\n\"He said first that all the Gods of the other nations were but dreams\nbesides the Gods of Carthage! He called you cowards, thieves, liars,\ndogs, and the sons of dogs! But for you (he said that!) the Republic\nwould not be forced to pay excessive tribute to the Romans; and through\nyour excesses you have drained it of perfumes, aromatics, slaves,\nand silphium, for you are in league with the nomads on the Cyrenian\nfrontier! But the guilty shall be punished! He read the enumeration of\ntheir torments; they shall be made to work at the paving of the streets,\nat the equipment of the vessels, at the adornment of the Syssitia, while\nthe rest shall be sent to scrape the earth in the mines in the country\nof the Cantabrians.\"\n\nSpendius repeated the same statements to the Gauls, Greeks, Campanians\nand Balearians. The Mercenaries, recognising several of the proper\nnames which had met their ears, were convinced that he was accurately\nreporting the Suffet's speech. A few cried out to him, \"You lie!\" but\ntheir voices were drowned in the tumult of the rest; Spendius added:\n\n\"Have you not seen that he has left a reserve of his horse-soldiers\noutside the camp? At a given signal they will hasten hither to slay you\nall.\"\n\nThe Barbarians turned in that direction, and as the crowd was then\nscattering, there appeared in the midst of them, and advancing with the\nslowness of a phantom, a human being, bent, lean, entirely naked, and\ncovered down to his flanks with long hair bristling with dried leaves,\ndust and thorns. About his loins and his knees he had wisps of straw and\nlinen rags; his soft and earthy skin hung on his emaciated limbs like\ntatters on dried boughs; his hands trembled with a continuous quivering,\nand as he walked he leaned on a staff of olive-wood.\n\nHe reached the Negroes who were bearing the torches. His pale gums were\ndisplayed in a sort of idiotic titter; his large, scared eyes gazed upon\nthe crowd of Barbarians around him.\n\nBut uttering a cry of terror he threw himself behind them, shielding\nhimself with their bodies. \"There they are! There they are!\" he\nstammered out, pointing to the Suffet's guards, who were motionless\nin their glittering armour. Their horses, dazzled by the light of the\ntorches which crackled in the darkness, were pawing the ground; the\nhuman spectre struggled and howled:\n\n\"They have killed them!\"\n\nAt these words, which were screamed in Balearic, some Balearians came up\nand recognised him; without answering them he repeated:\n\n\"Yes, all killed, all! crushed like grapes! The fine young men! the\nslingers! my companions and yours!\"\n\nThey gave him wine to drink, and he wept; then he launched forth into\nspeech.\n\nSpendius could scarcely repress his joy, as he explained the horrors\nrelated by Zarxas to the Greeks and Libyans; he could not believe them,\nso appropriately did they come in. The Balearians grew pale as they\nlearned how their companions had perished.\n\nIt was a troop of three hundred slingers who had disembarked the evening\nbefore, and had on that day slept too late. When they reached the\nsquare of Khamon the Barbarians were gone, and they found themselves\ndefenceless, their clay bullets having been put on the camels with the\nrest of the baggage. They were allowed to advance into the street of\nSatheb as far as the brass sheathed oaken gate; then the people with a\nsingle impulse had sprung upon them.\n\nIndeed, the soldiers remembered a great shout; Spendius, who was flying\nat the head of the columns, had not heard it.\n\nThen the corpses were placed in the arms of the Pataec gods that fringed\nthe temple of Khamon. They were upbraided with all the crimes of the\nMercenaries; their gluttony, their thefts, their impiety, their disdain,\nand the murder of the fishes in Salammbo's garden. Their bodies were\nsubjected to infamous mutilations; the priests burned their hair\nin order to torture their souls; they were hung up in pieces in the\nmeat-shops; some even buried their teeth in them, and in the evening\nfuneral-piles were kindled at the cross-ways to finish them.\n\nThese were the flames that had gleamed from a distance across the lake.\nBut some houses having taken fire, any dead or dying that remained were\nspeedily thrown over the walls; Zarxas had remained among the reeds on\nthe edge of the lake until the following day; then he had wandered about\nthrough the country, seeking for the army by the footprints in the dust.\nIn the morning he hid himself in caves; in the evening he resumed his\nmarch with his bleeding wounds, famished, sick, living on roots and\ncarrion; at last one day he perceived lances on the horizon, and he\nhad followed them, for his reason was disturbed through his terrors and\nmiseries.\n\nThe indignation of the soldiers, restrained so long as he was speaking,\nbroke forth like a tempest; they were going to massacre the guards\ntogether with the Suffet. A few interposed, saying that they ought to\nhear him and know at least whether they should be paid. Then they all\ncried: \"Our money!\" Hanno replied that he had brought it.\n\nThey ran to the outposts, and the Suffet's baggage arrived in the midst\nof the tents, pressed forward by the Barbarians. Without waiting for\nthe slaves, they very quickly unfastened the baskets; in them they\nfound hyacinth robes, sponges, scrapers, brushes, perfumes, and antimony\npencils for painting the eyes--all belonging to the guards, who were\nrich men and accustomed to such refinements. Next they uncovered a large\nbronze tub on a camel: it belonged to the Suffet who had it for bathing\nin during his journey; for he had taken all manner of precautions, even\ngoing so far as to bring caged weasels from Hecatompylos, which were\nburnt alive to make his ptisan. But, as his malady gave him a great\nappetite, there were also many comestibles and many wines, pickle, meats\nand fishes preserved in honey, with little pots of Commagene, or melted\ngoose-fat covered with snow and chopped straw. There was a considerable\nsupply of it; the more they opened the baskets the more they found, and\nlaughter arose like conflicting waves.\n\nAs to the pay of the Mercenaries it nearly filled two esparto-grass\nbaskets; there were even visible in one of them some of the leathern\ndiscs which the Republic used to economise its specie; and as the\nBarbarians appeared greatly surprised, Hanno told them that, their\naccounts being very difficult, the Ancients had not had leisure to\nexamine them. Meanwhile they had sent them this.\n\nThen everything was in disorder and confusion: mules, serving men,\nlitter, provisions, and baggage. The soldiers took the coin in the bags\nto stone Hanno. With great difficulty he was able to mount an ass; and\nhe fled, clinging to its hair, howling, weeping, shaken, bruised, and\ncalling down the curse of all the gods upon the army. His broad necklace\nof precious stones rebounded up to his ears. His cloak which was too\nlong, and which trailed behind him, he kept on with his teeth, and from\nafar the Barbarians shouted at him, \"Begone coward! pig! sink of Moloch!\nsweat your gold and your plague! quicker! quicker!\" The routed escort\ngalloped beside him.\n\nBut the fury of the Barbarians did not abate. They remembered that\nseveral of them who had set out for Carthage had not returned; no doubt\nthey had been killed. So much injustice exasperated them, and they began\nto pull up the stakes of their tents, to roll up their cloaks, and to\nbridle their horses; every one took his helmet and sword, and instantly\nall was ready. Those who had no arms rushed into the woods to cut\nstaves.\n\nDay dawned; the people of Sicca were roused, and stirring in the\nstreets. \"They are going to Carthage,\" said they, and the rumour of this\nsoon spread through the country.\n\nFrom every path and every ravine men arose. Shepherds were seen running\ndown from the mountains.\n\nThen, when the Barbarians had set out, Spendius circled the plain,\nriding on a Punic stallion, and attended by his slave, who led a third\nhorse.\n\nA single tent remained. Spendius entered it.\n\n\"Up, master! rise! we are departing!\"\n\n\"And where are you going?\" asked Matho.\n\n\"To Carthage!\" cried Spendius.\n\nMatho bounded upon the horse which the slave held at the door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSALAMMBO\n\nThe moon was rising just above the waves, and on the town which\nwas still wrapped in darkness there glittered white and luminous\nspecks:--the pole of a chariot, a dangling rag of linen, the corner of a\nwall, or a golden necklace on the bosom of a god. The glass balls on\nthe roofs of the temples beamed like great diamonds here and there.\nBut ill-defined ruins, piles of black earth, and gardens formed deeper\nmasses in the gloom, and below Malqua fishermen's nets stretched from\none house to another like gigantic bats spreading their wings. The\ngrinding of the hydraulic wheels which conveyed water to the highest\nstorys of the palaces, was no longer heard; and the camels, lying\nostrich fashion on their stomachs, rested peacefully in the middle of\nthe terraces. The porters were asleep in the streets on the thresholds\nof the houses; the shadows of the colossuses stretched across the\ndeserted squares; occasionally in the distance the smoke of a still\nburning sacrifice would escape through the bronze tiling, and the heavy\nbreeze would waft the odours of aromatics blended with the scent of the\nsea and the exhalation from the sun-heated walls. The motionless waves\nshone around Carthage, for the moon was spreading her light at once upon\nthe mountain-circled gulf and upon the lake of Tunis, where flamingoes\nformed long rose-coloured lines amid the banks of sand, while further\non beneath the catacombs the great salt lagoon shimmered like a piece\nof silver. The blue vault of heaven sank on the horizon in one direction\ninto the dustiness of the plains, and in the other into the mists of the\nsea, and on the summit of the Acropolis, the pyramidal cypress trees,\nfringing the temple of Eschmoun, swayed murmuring like the regular waves\nthat beat slowly along the mole beneath the ramparts.\n\nSalammbo ascended to the terrace of her palace, supported by a female\nslave who carried an iron dish filled with live coals.\n\nIn the middle of the terrace there was a small ivory bed covered\nwith lynx skins, and cushions made with the feathers of the parrot, a\nfatidical animal consecrated to the gods; and at the four corners rose\nfour long perfuming-pans filled with nard, incense, cinnamomum, and\nmyrrh. The slave lit the perfumes. Salammbo looked at the polar star;\nshe slowly saluted the four points of heaven, and knelt down on the\nground in the azure dust which was strewn with golden stars in imitation\nof the firmament. Then with both elbows against her sides, her fore-arms\nstraight and her hands open, she threw back her head beneath the rays of\nthe moon, and said:\n\n\"O Rabetna!--Baalet!--Tanith!\" and her voice was lengthened in a\nplaintive fashion as if calling to some one. \"Anaitis! Astarte! Derceto!\nAstoreth! Mylitta! Athara! Elissa! Tiratha!--By the hidden symbols, by\nthe resounding sistra,--by the furrows of the earth,--by the eternal\nsilence and by the eternal fruitfulness,--mistress of the gloomy sea and\nof the azure shores, O Queen of the watery world, all hail!\"\n\nShe swayed her whole body twice or thrice, and then cast herself face\ndownwards in the dust with both arms outstretched.\n\nBut the slave nimbly raised her, for according to the rites someone must\ncatch the suppliant at the moment of his prostration; this told him that\nthe gods accepted him, and Salammbo's nurse never failed in this pious\nduty.\n\nSome merchants from Darytian Gaetulia had brought her to Carthage when\nquite young, and after her enfranchisement she would not forsake her old\nmasters, as was shown by her right ear, which was pierced with a large\nhole. A petticoat of many-coloured stripes fitted closely on her hips,\nand fell to her ankles, where two tin rings clashed together. Her\nsomewhat flat face was yellow like her tunic. Silver bodkins of great\nlength formed a sun behind her head. She wore a coral button on the\nnostril, and she stood beside the bed more erect than a Hermes, and with\nher eyelids cast down.\n\nSalammbo walked to the edge of the terrace; her eyes swept the horizon\nfor an instant, and then were lowered upon the sleeping town, while the\nsigh that she heaved swelled her bosom, and gave an undulating movement\nto the whole length of the long white simar which hung without clasp or\ngirdle about her. Her curved and painted sandals were hidden beneath\na heap of emeralds, and a net of purple thread was filled with her\ndisordered hair.\n\nBut she raised her head to gaze upon the moon, and murmured, mingling\nher speech with fragments of hymns:\n\n\"How lightly turnest thou, supported by the impalpable ether! It\nbrightens about thee, and 'tis the stir of thine agitation that\ndistributes the winds and fruitful dews. According as thou dost wax\nand wane the eyes of cats and spots of panthers lengthen or grow short.\nWives shriek thy name in the pangs of childbirth! Thou makest the shells\nto swell, the wine to bubble, and the corpse to putrefy! Thou formest\nthe pearls at the bottom of the sea!\n\n\"And every germ, O goddess! ferments in the dark depths of thy moisture.\n\n\"When thou appearest, quietness is spread abroad upon the earth; the\nflowers close, the waves are soothed, wearied man stretches his breast\ntoward thee, and the world with its oceans and mountains looks at\nitself in thy face as in a mirror. Thou art white, gentle, luminous,\nimmaculate, helping, purifying, serene!\"\n\nThe crescent of the moon was then over the mountain of the Hot Springs,\nin the hollow formed by its two summits, on the other side of the gulf.\nBelow it there was a little star, and all around it a pale circle.\nSalammbo went on:\n\n\"But thou art a terrible mistress!--Monsters, terrifying phantoms, and\nlying dreams come from thee; thine eyes devour the stones of buildings,\nand the apes are ever ill each time thou growest young again.\n\n\"Whither goest thou? Why dost thou change thy forms continually? Now,\nslender and curved thou glidest through space like a mastless galley;\nand then, amid the stars, thou art like a shepherd keeping his flock.\nShining and round, thou dost graze the mountain-tops like the wheel of a\nchariot.\n\n\"O Tanith! thou dost love me? I have looked so much on thee! But no!\nthou sailest through thine azure, and I--I remain on the motionless\nearth.\n\n\"Taanach, take your nebal and play softly on the silver string, for my\nheart is sad!\"\n\nThe slave lifted a sort of harp of ebony wood, taller than herself,\nand triangular in shape like a delta; she fixed the point in a crystal\nglobe, and with both hands began to play.\n\nThe sounds followed one another hurried and deep, like the buzzing of\nbees, and with increasing sonorousness floated away into the night with\nthe complaining of the waves, and the rustling of the great trees on the\nsummit of the Acropolis.\n\n\"Hush!\" cried Salammbo.\n\n\"What ails you, mistress? The blowing of the breeze, the passing of a\ncloud, everything disquiets you just now!\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said.\n\n\"You are wearied with too long prayers!\"\n\n\"Oh! Tanaach, I would fain be dissolved in them like a flower in wine!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is the smoke of your perfumes?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Salammbo; \"the spirit of the gods dwells in fragrant odours.\"\n\nThen the slave spoke to her of her father. It was thought that he had\ngone towards the amber country, behind the pillars of Melkarth. \"But if\nhe does not return,\" she said, \"you must nevertheless, since it was his\nwill, choose a husband among the sons of the Ancients, and then your\ngrief will pass away in a man's arms.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the young girl. All those that she had seen had horrified\nher with their fallow-deer laughter and their coarse limbs.\n\n\"Sometimes, Tanaach, from the depths of my being there exhale as it were\nhot fumes heavier than the vapours from a volcano. Voices call me, a\nglobe of fire rolls and mounts within my bosom, it stifles me, I am at\nthe point of death; and then, something sweet, flowing from my brow to\nmy feet, passes through my flesh--it is a caress enfolding me, and I\nfeel myself crushed as if some god were stretched upon me. Oh! would\nthat I could lose myself in the mists of the night, the waters of the\nfountains, the sap of the trees, that I could issue from my body, and be\nbut a breath, or a ray, and glide, mount up to thee, O Mother!\"\n\nShe raised her arms to their full length, arching her form, which in\nits long garment was as pale and light as the moon. Then she fell back,\npanting, on the ivory couch; but Taanach passed an amber necklace with\ndolphin's teeth about her neck to banish terrors, and Salammbo said in\nan almost stifled voice: \"Go and bring me Schahabarim.\"\n\nHer father had not wished her to enter the college of priestesses,\nnor even to be made at all acquainted with the popular Tanith. He was\nreserving her for some alliance that might serve his political ends;\nso that Salammbo lived alone in the midst of the palace. Her mother was\nlong since dead.\n\nShe had grown up with abstinences, fastings and purifications, always\nsurrounded by grave and exquisite things, her body saturated with\nperfumes, and her soul filled with prayers. She had never tasted wine,\nnor eaten meat, nor touched an unclean animal, nor set her heels in the\nhouse of death.\n\nShe knew nothing of obscene images, for as each god was manifested\nin different forms, the same principle often received the witness of\ncontradictory cults, and Salammbo worshipped the goddess in her sidereal\npresentation. An influence had descended upon the maiden from the\nmoon; when the planet passed diminishing away, Salammbo grew weak. She\nlanguished the whole day long, and revived at evening. During an eclipse\nshe nearly died.\n\nBut Rabetna, in jealousy, revenged herself for the virginity withdrawn\nfrom her sacrifices, and she tormented Salammbo with possessions, all\nthe stronger for being vague, which were spread through this belief and\nexcited by it.\n\nUnceasingly was Hamilcar's daughter disquieted about Tanith. She had\nlearned her adventures, her travels, and all her names, which she would\nrepeat without their having any distinct signification for her. In\norder to penetrate into the depths of her dogma, she wished to become\nacquainted, in the most secret part of the temple, with the old idol in\nthe magnificent mantle, whereon depended the destinies of Carthage, for\nthe idea of a god did not stand out clearly from his representation,\nand to hold, or even see the image of one, was to take away part of his\nvirtue, and in a measure to rule him.\n\nBut Salammbo turned around. She had recognised the sound of the golden\nbells which Schahabarim wore at the hem of his garment.\n\nHe ascended the staircases; then at the threshold of the terrace he\nstopped and folded his arms.\n\nHis sunken eyes shone like the lamps of a sepulchre; his long thin body\nfloated in its linen robe which was weighted by the bells, the latter\nalternating with balls of emeralds at his heels. He had feeble limbs, an\noblique skull and a pointed chin; his skin seemed cold to the touch, and\nhis yellow face, which was deeply furrowed with wrinkles, was as if it\ncontracted in a longing, in an everlasting grief.\n\nHe was the high priest of Tanith, and it was he who had educated\nSalammbo.\n\n\"Speak!\" he said. \"What will you?\"\n\n\"I hoped--you had almost promised me--\" She stammered and was confused;\nthen suddenly: \"Why do you despise me? what have I forgotten in\nthe rites? You are my master, and you told me that no one was so\naccomplished in the things pertaining to the goddess as I; but there are\nsome of which you will not speak. Is it so, O father?\"\n\nSchahabarim remembered Hamilcar's orders, and replied:\n\n\"No, I have nothing more to teach you!\"\n\n\"A genius,\" she resumed, \"impels me to this love. I have climbed the\nsteps of Eschmoun, god of the planets and intelligences; I have slept\nbeneath the golden olive of Melkarth, patron of the Tyrian colonies;\nI have pushed open the doors of Baal-Khamon, the enlightener and\nfertiliser; I have sacrificed to the subterranean Kabiri, to the gods\nof woods, winds, rivers and mountains; but, can you understand? they\nare all too far away, too high, too insensible, while she--I feel\nher mingled in my life; she fills my soul, and I quiver with inward\nstartings, as though she were leaping in order to escape. Methinks I am\nabout to hear her voice, and see her face, lightnings dazzle me and then\nI sink back again into the darkness.\"\n\nSchahabarim was silent. She entreated him with suppliant looks. At\nlast he made a sign for the dismissal of the slave, who was not of\nChanaanitish race. Taanach disappeared, and Schahabarim, raising one arm\nin the air, began:\n\n\"Before the gods darkness alone was, and a breathing stirred dull\nand indistinct as the conscience of a man in a dream. It contracted,\ncreating Desire and Cloud, and from Desire and Cloud there issued\nprimitive Matter. This was a water, muddy, black, icy and deep. It\ncontained senseless monsters, incoherent portions of the forms to be\nborn, which are painted on the walls of the sanctuaries.\n\n\"Then Matter condensed. It became an egg. It burst. One half formed the\nearth and the other the firmament. Sun, moon, winds and clouds appeared,\nand at the crash of the thunder intelligent creatures awoke. Then\nEschmoun spread himself in the starry sphere; Khamon beamed in the sun;\nMelkarth thrust him with his arms behind Gades; the Kabiri descended\nbeneath the volcanoes, and Rabetna like a nurse bent over the world\npouring out her light like milk, and her night like a mantle.\"\n\n\"And then?\" she said.\n\nHe had related the secret of the origins to her, to divert her from\nsublimer prospects; but the maiden's desire kindled again at his last\nwords, and Schahabarim, half yielding resumed:\n\n\"She inspires and governs the loves of men.\"\n\n\"The loves of men!\" repeated Salammbo dreamily.\n\n\"She is the soul of Carthage,\" continued the priest; \"and although she\nis everywhere diffused, it is here that she dwells, beneath the sacred\nveil.\"\n\n\"O father!\" cried Salammbo, \"I shall see her, shall I not? you will\nbring me to her! I had long been hesitating; I am devoured with\ncuriosity to see her form. Pity! help me! let us go?\"\n\nHe repulsed her with a vehement gesture that was full of pride.\n\n\"Never! Do you not know that it means death? The hermaphrodite Baals are\nunveiled to us alone who are men in understanding and women in weakness.\nYour desire is sacrilege; be satisfied with the knowledge that you\npossess!\"\n\nShe fell upon her knees placing two fingers against her ears in token of\nrepentance; and crushed by the priest's words, and filled at once with\nanger against him, with terror and humiliation, she burst into sobs.\nSchahabarim remained erect, and more insensible than the stones of the\nterrace. He looked down upon her quivering at his feet, and felt a kind\nof joy on seeing her suffer for his divinity whom he himself could not\nwholly embrace. The birds were already singing, a cold wind was blowing,\nand little clouds were drifting in the paling sky.\n\nSuddenly he perceived on the horizon, behind Tunis, what looked like\nslight mists trailing along the ground; then these became a great\ncurtain of dust extending perpendicularly, and, amid the whirlwinds of\nthe thronging mass, dromedaries' heads, lances and shields appeared. It\nwas the army of the Barbarians advancing upon Carthage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBENEATH THE WALLS OF CARTHAGE\n\nSome country people, riding on asses or running on foot, arrived in the\ntown, pale, breathless, and mad with fear. They were flying before the\narmy. It had accomplished the journey from Sicca in three days, in order\nto reach Carthage and wholly exterminate it.\n\nThe gates were shut. The Barbarians appeared almost immediately; but\nthey stopped in the middle of the isthmus, on the edge of the lake.\n\nAt first they made no hostile announcement. Several approached with palm\nbranches in their hands. They were driven back with arrows, so great was\nthe terror.\n\nIn the morning and at nightfall prowlers would sometimes wander along\nthe walls. A little man carefully wrapped in a cloak, and with his face\nconcealed beneath a very low visor, was especially noticed. He would\nremain whole hours gazing at the aqueduct, and so persistently that he\ndoubtless wished to mislead the Carthaginians as to his real designs.\nAnother man, a sort of giant who walked bareheaded, used to accompany\nhim.\n\nBut Carthage was defended throughout the whole breadth of the isthmus:\nfirst by a trench, then by a grassy rampart, and lastly by a wall thirty\ncubits high, built of freestone, and in two storys. It contained stables\nfor three hundred elephants with stores for their caparisons, shackles,\nand food; other stables again for four thousand horses with supplies\nof barley and harness, and barracks for twenty thousand soldiers with\narmour and all materials of war. Towers rose from the second story, all\nprovided with battlements, and having bronze bucklers hung on cramps on\nthe outside.\n\nThis first line of wall gave immediate shelter to Malqua, the sailors'\nand dyers' quarter. Masts might be seen whereon purple sails were\ndrying, and on the highest terraces clay furnaces for heating the pickle\nwere visible.\n\nBehind, the lofty houses of the city rose in an ampitheatre of cubical\nform. They were built of stone, planks, shingle, reeds, shells, and\nbeaten earth. The woods belonging to the temples were like lakes of\nverdure in this mountain of diversely-coloured blocks. It was levelled\nat unequal distances by the public squares, and was cut from top to\nbottom by countless intersecting lanes. The enclosures of the three old\nquarters which are now lost might be distinguished; they rose here\nand there like great reefs, or extended in enormous fronts, blackened,\nhalf-covered with flowers, and broadly striped by the casting of filth,\nwhile streets passed through their yawning apertures like rivers beneath\nbridges.\n\nThe hill of the Acropolis, in the centre of Byrsa, was hidden beneath a\ndisordered array of monuments. There were temples with wreathed columns\nbearing bronze capitals and metal chains, cones of dry stones with bands\nof azure, copper cupolas, marble architraves, Babylonian buttresses,\nobelisks poised on their points like inverted torches. Peristyles\nreached to pediments; volutes were displayed through colonnades; granite\nwalls supported tile partitions; the whole mounting, half-hidden, the\none above the other in a marvellous and incomprehensible fashion. In it\nmight be felt the succession of the ages, and, as it were, the memorials\nof forgotten fatherlands.\n\nBehind the Acropolis the Mappalian road, which was lined with tombs,\nextended through red lands in a straight line from the shore to the\ncatacombs; then spacious dwellings occurred at intervals in the gardens,\nand this third quarter, Megara, which was the new town, reached as far\nas the edge of the cliff, where rose a giant pharos that blazed forth\nevery night.\n\nIn this fashion was Carthage displayed before the soldiers quartered in\nthe plain.\n\nThey could recognise the markets and crossways in the distance, and\ndisputed with one another as to the sites of the temples. Khamon's,\nfronting the Syssitia, had golden tiles; Melkarth, to the left of\nEschmoun, had branches of coral on its roofing; beyond, Tanith's copper\ncupola swelled among the palm trees; the dark Moloch was below\nthe cisterns, in the direction of the pharos. At the angles of the\npediments, on the tops of the walls, at the corners of the squares,\neverywhere, divinities with hideous heads might be seen, colossal or\nsquat, with enormous bellies, or immoderately flattened, opening their\njaws, extending their arms, and holding forks, chains or javelins in\ntheir hands; while the blue of the sea stretched away behind the streets\nwhich were rendered still steeper by the perspective.\n\nThey were filled from morning till evening with a tumultuous people;\nyoung boys shaking little bells, shouted at the doors of the baths; the\nshops for hot drinks smoked, the air resounded with the noise of anvils,\nthe white cocks, sacred to the Sun, crowed on the terraces, the oxen\nthat were being slaughtered bellowed in the temples, slaves ran about\nwith baskets on their heads; and in the depths of the porticoes a priest\nwould sometimes appear, draped in a dark cloak, barefooted, and wearing\na pointed cap.\n\nThe spectacle afforded by Carthage irritated the Barbarians; they\nadmired it and execrated it, and would have liked both to annihilate it\nand to dwell in it. But what was there in the Military Harbour defended\nby a triple wall? Then behind the town, at the back of Megara, and\nhigher than the Acropolis, appeared Hamilcar's palace.\n\nMatho's eyes were directed thither every moment. He would ascend the\nolive trees and lean over with his hand spread out above his eyebrows.\nThe gardens were empty, and the red door with its black cross remained\nconstantly shut.\n\nMore than twenty times he walked round the ramparts, seeking some breach\nby which he might enter. One night he threw himself into the gulf and\nswam for three hours at a stretch. He reached the foot of the Mappalian\nquarter and tried to climb up the face of the cliff. He covered his\nknees with blood, broke his nails, and then fell back into the waves and\nreturned.\n\nHis impotence exasperated him. He was jealous of this Carthage which\ncontained Salammbo, as if of some one who had possessed her. His\nnervelessness left him to be replaced by a mad and continual eagerness\nfor action. With flaming cheek, angry eyes, and hoarse voice, he would\nwalk with rapid strides through the camp; or seated on the shore he\nwould scour his great sword with sand. He shot arrows at the passing\nvultures. His heart overflowed into frenzied speech.\n\n\"Give free course to your wrath like a runaway chariot,\" said Spendius.\n\"Shout, blaspheme, ravage and slay. Grief is allayed with blood, and\nsince you cannot sate your love, gorge your hate; it will sustain you!\"\n\nMatho resumed the command of his soldiers. He drilled them pitilessly.\nHe was respected for his courage and especially for his strength.\nMoreover he inspired a sort of mystic dread, and it was believed that\nhe conversed at night with phantoms. The other captains were animated\nby his example. The army soon grew disciplined. From their houses the\nCarthaginians could hear the bugle-flourishes that regulated their\nexercises. At last the Barbarians drew near.\n\nTo crush them in the isthmus it would have been necessary for two armies\nto take them simultaneously in the rear, one disembarking at the end of\nthe gulf of Utica, and the second at the mountain of the Hot Springs.\nBut what could be done with the single sacred Legion, mustering at most\nsix thousand men? If the enemy bent towards the east they would join the\nnomads and intercept the commerce of the desert. If they fell back to\nthe west, Numidia would rise. Finally, lack of provisions would\nsooner or later lead them to devastate the surrounding country like\ngrasshoppers, and the rich trembled for their fine country-houses, their\nvineyards and their cultivated lands.\n\nHanno proposed atrocious and impracticable measures, such as promising a\nheavy sum for every Barbarian's head, or setting fire to their camp with\nships and machines. His colleague Gisco, on the other hand, wished them\nto be paid. But the Ancients detested him owing to his popularity; for\nthey dreaded the risk of a master, and through terror of monarchy strove\nto weaken whatever contributed to it or might re-establish it.\n\nOutside the fortification there were people of another race and of\nunknown origin, all hunters of the porcupine, and eaters of shell-fish\nand serpents. They used to go into caves to catch hyenas alive, and\namuse themselves by making them run in the evening on the sands of\nMegara between the stelae of the tombs. Their huts, which were made of\nmud and wrack, hung on the cliff like swallows' nests. There they lived,\nwithout government and without gods, pell-mell, completely naked, at\nonce feeble and fierce, and execrated by the people of all time on\naccount of their unclean food. One morning the sentries perceived that\nthey were all gone.\n\nAt last some members of the Great Council arrived at a decision. They\ncame to the camp without necklaces or girdles, and in open sandals\nlike neighbours. They walked at a quiet pace, waving salutations to\nthe captains, or stopped to speak to the soldiers, saying that all was\nfinished and that justice was about to be done to their claims.\n\nMany of them saw a camp of Mercenaries for the first time. Instead of\nthe confusion which they had pictured to themselves, there prevailed\neverywhere terrible silence and order. A grassy rampart formed a lofty\nwall round the army immovable by the shock of catapults. The ground in\nthe streets was sprinkled with fresh water; through the holes in the\ntents they could perceive tawny eyeballs gleaming in the shade. The\npiles of pikes and hanging panoplies dazzled them like mirrors. They\nconversed in low tones. They were afraid of upsetting something with\ntheir long robes.\n\nThe soldiers requested provisions, undertaking to pay for them out of\nthe money that was due.\n\nOxen, sheep, guinea fowl, fruit and lupins were sent to them, with\nsmoked scombri, that excellent scombri which Carthage dispatched to\nevery port. But they walked scornfully around the magnificent cattle,\nand disparaging what they coveted, offered the worth of a pigeon for\na ram, or the price of a pomegranate for three goats. The Eaters of\nUncleanness came forward as arbitrators, and declared that they were\nbeing duped. Then they drew their swords with threats to slay.\n\nCommissaries of the Great Council wrote down the number of years for\nwhich pay was due to each soldier. But it was no longer possible to know\nhow many Mercenaries had been engaged, and the Ancients were dismayed at\nthe enormous sum which they would have to pay. The reserve of silphium\nmust be sold, and the trading towns taxed; the Mercenaries would grow\nimpatient; Tunis was already with them; and the rich, stunned by Hanno's\nragings and his colleague's reproaches, urged any citizens who might\nknow a Barbarian to go to see him immediately in order to win back\nhis friendship, and to speak him fair. Such a show of confidence would\nsoothe them.\n\nTraders, scribes, workers in the arsenal, and whole families visited the\nBarbarians.\n\nThe soldiers allowed all the Carthaginians to come in, but by a single\npassage so narrow that four men abreast jostled one another in it.\nSpendius, standing against the barrier, had them carefully searched;\nfacing him Matho was examining the multitude, trying to recognise some\none whom he might have seen at Salammbo's palace.\n\nThe camp was like a town, so full of people and of movement was it. The\ntwo distinct crowds mingled without blending, one dressed in linen or\nwool, with felt caps like fir-cones, and the other clad in iron and\nwearing helmets. Amid serving men and itinerant vendors there moved\nwomen of all nations, as brown as ripe dates, as greenish as olives,\nas yellow as oranges, sold by sailors, picked out of dens, stolen from\ncaravans, taken in the sacking of towns, women that were jaded with love\nso long as they were young, and plied with blows when they were old, and\nthat died in routs on the roadsides among the baggage and the abandoned\nbeasts of burden. The wives of the nomads had square, tawny robes of\ndromedary's hair swinging at their heels; musicians from Cyrenaica,\nwrapped in violet gauze and with painted eyebrows, sang, squatting on\nmats; old Negresses with hanging breasts gathered the animals' dung\nthat was drying in the sun to light their fires; the Syracusan women had\ngolden plates in their hair; the Lusitanians had necklaces of shells;\nthe Gauls wore wolf skins upon their white bosoms; and sturdy children,\nvermin-covered, naked and uncircumcised, butted with their heads against\npassers-by, or came behind them like young tigers to bite their hands.\n\nThe Carthaginians walked through the camp, surprised at the quantities\nof things with which it was running over. The most miserable were\nmelancholy, and the rest dissembled their anxiety.\n\nThe soldiers struck them on the shoulder, and exhorted them to be gay.\nAs soon as they saw any one, they invited him to their amusements. If\nthey were playing at discus, they would manage to crush his feet, or\nif at boxing to fracture his jaw with the very first blow. The slingers\nterrified the Carthaginians with their slings, the Psylli with their\nvipers, and the horsemen with their horses, while their victims,\naddicted as they were to peaceful occupations, bent their heads and\ntried to smile at all these outrages. Some, in order to show themselves\nbrave, made signs that they should like to become soldiers. They were\nset to split wood and to curry mules. They were buckled up in armour,\nand rolled like casks through the streets of the camp. Then, when\nthey were about to leave, the Mercenaries plucked out their hair with\ngrotesque contortions.\n\nBut many, from foolishness or prejudice, innocently believed that all\nthe Carthaginians were very rich, and they walked behind them entreating\nthem to grant them something. They requested everything that they\nthought fine: a ring, a girdle, sandals, the fringe of a robe, and when\nthe despoiled Carthaginian cried--\"But I have nothing left. What do you\nwant?\" they would reply, \"Your wife!\" Others even said, \"Your life!\"\n\nThe military accounts were handed to the captains, read to the soldiers,\nand definitively approved. Then they claimed tents; they received them.\nNext the polemarchs of the Greeks demanded some of the handsome suits of\narmour that were manufactured at Carthage; the Great Council voted\nsums of money for their purchase. But it was only fair, so the horsemen\npretended, that the Republic should indemnify them for their horses;\none had lost three at such a siege, another, five during such a march,\nanother, fourteen in the precipices. Stallions from Hecatompylos were\noffered to them, but they preferred money.\n\nNext they demanded that they should be paid in money (in pieces of\nmoney, and not in leathern coins) for all the corn that was owing to\nthem, and at the highest price that it had fetched during the war; so\nthat they exacted four hundred times as much for a measure of meal as\nthey had given for a sack of wheat. Such injustice was exasperating; but\nit was necessary, nevertheless, to submit.\n\nThen the delegates from the soldiers and from the Great Council swore\nrenewed friendship by the Genius of Carthage and the gods of the\nBarbarians. They exchanged excuses and caresses with oriental\ndemonstrativeness and verbosity. Then the soldiers claimed, as a proof\nof friendship, the punishment of those who had estranged them from the\nRepublic.\n\nTheir meaning, it was pretended, was not understood, and they explained\nthemselves more clearly by saying that they must have Hanno's head.\n\nSeveral times a day, they left their camp, and walked along the foot of\nthe walls, shouting a demand that the Suffet's head should be thrown to\nthem, and holding out their robes to receive it.\n\nThe Great Council would perhaps have given way but for a last exaction,\nmore outrageous than the rest; they demanded maidens, chosen from\nillustrious families, in marriage for their chiefs. It was an idea\nwhich had emanated from Spendius, and which many thought most simple and\npracticable. But the assumption of their desire to mix with Punic blood\nmade the people indignant; and they were bluntly told that they were to\nreceive no more. Then they exclaimed that they had been deceived,\nand that if their pay did not arrive within three days, they would\nthemselves go and take it in Carthage.\n\nThe bad faith of the Mercenaries was not so complete as their enemies\nthought. Hamilcar had made them extravagant promises, vague, it is true,\nbut at the same time solemn and reiterated. They might have believed\nthat when they disembarked at Carthage the town would be abandoned to\nthem, and that they should have treasures divided among them; and\nwhen they saw that scarcely their wages would be paid, the disillusion\ntouched their pride no less than their greed.\n\nHad not Dionysius, Pyrrhus, Agathocles, and the generals of Alexander\nfurnished examples of marvellous good fortune? Hercules, whom the\nChanaanites confounded with the sun, was the ideal which shone on the\nhorizon of armies. They knew that simple soldiers had worn diadems, and\nthe echoes of crumbling empires would furnish dreams to the Gaul in\nhis oak forest, to the Ethiopian amid his sands. But there was a nation\nalways ready to turn courage to account; and the robber driven from\nhis tribe, the patricide wandering on the roads, the perpetrator of\nsacrilege pursued by the gods, all who were starving or in despair\nstrove to reach the port where the Carthaginian broker was recruiting\nsoldiers. Usually the Republic kept its promises. This time, however,\nthe eagerness of its avarice had brought it into perilous disgrace.\nNumidians, Libyans, the whole of Africa was about to fall upon Carthage.\nOnly the sea was open to it, and there it met with the Romans; so that,\nlike a man assailed by murderers, it felt death all around it.\n\nIt was quite necessary to have recourse to Gisco, and the Barbarians\naccepted his intervention. One morning they saw the chains of the\nharbour lowered, and three flat-bottomed boats passing through the canal\nof Taenia entered the lake.\n\nGisco was visible on the first at the prow. Behind him rose an enormous\nchest, higher than a catafalque, and furnished with rings like hanging\ncrowns. Then appeared the legion of interpreters, with their hair\ndressed like sphinxes, and with parrots tattooed on their breasts.\nFriends and slaves followed, all without arms, and in such numbers that\nthey shouldered one another. The three long, dangerously-loaded barges\nadvanced amid the shouts of the onlooking army.\n\nAs soon as Gisco disembarked the soldiers ran to him. He had a sort of\ntribune erected with knapsacks, and declared that he should not depart\nbefore he had paid them all in full.\n\nThere was an outburst of applause, and it was a long time before he was\nable to speak.\n\nThen he censured the wrongs done to the Republic, and to the Barbarians;\nthe fault lay with a few mutineers who had alarmed Carthage by their\nviolence. The best proof of good intention on the part of the latter was\nthat it was he, the eternal adversary of the Suffet Hanno, who was sent\nto them. They must not credit the people with the folly of desiring to\nprovoke brave men, nor with ingratitude enough not to recognise their\nservices; and Gisco began to pay the soldiers, commencing with the\nLibyans. As they had declared that the lists were untruthful, he made no\nuse of them.\n\nThey defiled before him according to nationality, opening their fingers\nto show the number of their years of service; they were marked in\nsuccession with green paint on the left arm; the scribes dipped into the\nyawning coffer, while others made holes with a style on a sheet of lead.\n\nA man passed walking heavily like an ox.\n\n\"Come up beside me,\" said the Suffet, suspecting some fraud; \"how many\nyears have you served?\"\n\n\"Twelve,\" replied the Libyan.\n\nGisco slipped his fingers under his chin, for the chin-piece of the\nhelmet used in course of time to occasion two callosities there; these\nwere called carobs, and \"to have the carobs\" was an expression used to\ndenote a veteran.\n\n\"Thief!\" exclaimed the Suffet, \"your shoulders ought to have what your\nface lacks!\" and tearing off his tunic he laid bare is back which was\ncovered with a bleeding scab; he was a labourer from Hippo-Zarytus.\nHootings were raised, and he was decapitated.\n\nAs soon as night fell, Spendius went and roused the Libyans, and said to\nthem:\n\n\"When the Ligurians, Greeks, Balearians, and men of Italy are paid,\nthey will return. But as for you, you will remain in Africa, scattered\nthrough your tribes, and without any means of defence! It will be then\nthat the Republic will take its revenge! Mistrust the journey! Are you\ngoing to believe everything that is said? Both the Suffets are agreed,\nand this one is imposing on you! Remember the Island of Bones, and\nXanthippus, whom they sent back to Sparta in a rotten galley!\"\n\n\"How are we to proceed?\" they asked.\n\n\"Reflect!\" said Spendius.\n\nThe two following days were spent in paying the men of Magdala, Leptis,\nand Hecatompylos; Spendius went about among the Gauls.\n\n\"They are paying off the Libyans, and then they will discharge the\nGreeks, the Balearians, the Asiatics and all the rest! But you, who are\nfew in number, will receive nothing! You will see your native lands no\nmore! You will have no ships, and they will kill you to save your food!\"\n\nThe Gauls came to the Suffet. Autaritus, he whom he had wounded at\nHamilcar's palace, put questions to him, but was repelled by the slaves,\nand disappeared swearing he would be revenged.\n\nThe demands and complaints multiplied. The most obstinate penetrated at\nnight into the Suffet's tent; they took his hands and sought to move him\nby making him feel their toothless mouths, their wasted arms, and the\nscars of their wounds. Those who had not yet been paid were growing\nangry, those who had received the money demanded more for their horses;\nand vagabonds and outlaws assumed soldiers' arms and declared that they\nwere being forgotten. Every minute there arrived whirlwinds of men,\nas it were; the tents strained and fell; the multitude, thick pressed\nbetween the ramparts of the camp, swayed with loud shouts from the gates\nto the centre. When the tumult grew excessively violent Gisco would rest\none elbow on his ivory sceptre and stand motionless looking at the sea\nwith his fingers buried in his beard.\n\nMatho frequently went off to speak with Spendius; then he would again\nplace himself in front of the Suffet, and Gisco could feel his eyes\ncontinually like two flaming phalaricas darted against him. Several\ntimes they hurled reproaches at each other over the heads of the crowd,\nbut without making themselves heard. The distribution, meanwhile,\ncontinued, and the Suffet found expedients to remove every obstacle.\n\nThe Greeks tried to quibble about differences in currency, but he\nfurnished them with such explanations that they retired without a\nmurmur. The Negroes demanded white shells such as are used for trading\nin the interior of Africa, but when he offered to send to Carthage for\nthem they accepted money like the rest.\n\nBut the Balearians had been promised something better, namely, women.\nThe Suffet replied that a whole caravan of maidens was expected for\nthem, but the journey was long and would require six moons more. When\nthey were fat and well rubbed with benjamin they should be sent in ships\nto the ports of the Balearians.\n\nSuddenly Zarxas, now handsome and vigorous, leaped like a mountebank\nupon the shoulders of his friends and cried:\n\n\"Have you reserved any of them for the corpses?\" at the same time\npointing to the gate of Khamon in Carthage.\n\nThe brass plates with which it was furnished from top to bottom shone\nin the sun's latest fires, and the Barbarians believed that they could\ndiscern on it a trail of blood. Every time that Gisco wished to speak\ntheir shouts began again. At last he descended with measured steps, and\nshut himself up in his tent.\n\nWhen he left it at sunrise his interpreters, who used to sleep outside,\ndid not stir; they lay on their backs with their eyes fixed, their\ntongues between their teeth, and their faces of a bluish colour. White\nmucus flowed from their nostrils, and their limbs were stiff, as if\nthey had all been frozen by the cold during the night. Each had a little\nnoose of rushes round his neck.\n\nFrom that time onward the rebellion was unchecked. The murder of the\nBalearians which had been recalled by Zarxas strengthened the distrust\ninspired by Spendius. They imagined that the Republic was always trying\nto deceive them. An end must be put to it! The interpreters should be\ndispensed with! Zarxas sang war songs with a sling around his head;\nAutaritus brandished his great sword; Spendius whispered a word to one\nor gave a dagger to another. The boldest endeavoured to pay themselves,\nwhile those who were less frenzied wished to have the distribution\ncontinued. No one now relinquished his arms, and the anger of all\ncombined into a tumultuous hatred of Gisco.\n\nSome got up beside him. So long as they vociferated abuse they were\nlistened to with patience; but if they tried to utter the least word in\nhis behalf they were immediately stoned, or their heads were cut off\nby a sabre-stroke from behind. The heap of knapsacks was redder than an\naltar.\n\nThey became terrible after their meal and when they had drunk wine! This\nwas an enjoyment forbidden in the Punic armies under pain of death, and\nthey raised their cups in the direction of Carthage in derision of its\ndiscipline. Then they returned to the slaves of the exchequer and again\nbegan to kill. The word \"strike,\" though different in each language, was\nunderstood by all.\n\nGisco was well aware that he was being abandoned by his country; but in\nspite of its ingratitude he would not dishonour it. When they reminded\nhim that they had been promised ships, he swore by Moloch to provide\nthem himself at his own expense, and pulling off his necklace of blue\nstones he threw it into the crowd as the pledge of his oath.\n\nThen the Africans claimed the corn in accordance with the engagements\nmade by the Great Council. Gisco spread out the accounts of the Syssitia\ntraced in violet pigment on sheep skins; and read out all that had\nentered Carthage month by month and day by day.\n\nSuddenly he stopped with gaping eyes, as if he had just discovered his\nsentence of death among the figures.\n\nThe Ancients had, in fact, fraudulently reduced them, and the corn sold\nduring the most calamitous period of the war was set down at so low a\nrate that, blindness apart, it was impossible to believe it.\n\n\"Speak!\" they shouted. \"Louder! Ah! he is trying to lie, the coward!\nDon't trust him.\"\n\nFor some time he hesitated. At last he resumed his task.\n\nThe soldiers, without suspecting that they were being deceived, accepted\nthe accounts of the Syssitia as true. But the abundance that had\nprevailed at Carthage made them furiously jealous. They broke open the\nsycamore chest; it was three parts empty. They had seen such sums coming\nout of it, that they thought it inexhaustible; Gisco must have buried\nsome in his tent. They scaled the knapsacks. Matho led them, and as they\nshouted \"The money! the money!\" Gisco at last replied:\n\n\"Let your general give it to you!\"\n\nHe looked them in the face without speaking, with his great yellow eyes,\nand his long face that was paler than his beard. An arrow, held by its\nfeathers, hung from the large gold ring in his ear, and a stream of\nblood was trickling from his tiara upon his shoulder.\n\nAt a gesture from Matho all advanced. Gisco held out his arms; Spendius\ntied his wrists with a slip knot; another knocked him down, and he\ndisappeared amid the disorder of the crowd which was stumbling over the\nknapsacks.\n\nThey sacked his tent. Nothing was found in it except things\nindispensable to life; and, on a closer search, three images of Tanith,\nand, wrapped up in an ape's skin, a black stone which had fallen from\nthe moon. Many Carthaginians had chosen to accompany him; they were\neminent men, and all belonged to the war party.\n\nThey were dragged outside the tents and thrown into the pit used for the\nreception of filth. They were tied with iron chains around the body to\nsolid stakes, and were offered food at the point of the javelin.\n\nAutaritus overwhelmed them with invectives as he inspected them, but\nbeing quite ignorant of his language they made no reply; and the Gaul\nfrom time to time threw pebbles at their faces to make them cry out.\n\nThe next day a sort of languor took possession of the army. Now that\ntheir anger was over they were seized with anxiety. Matho was suffering\nfrom vague melancholy. It seemed to him that Salammbo had indirectly\nbeen insulted. These rich men were a kind of appendage to her person.\nHe sat down in the night on the edge of the pit, and recognised in their\ngroanings something of the voice of which his heart was full.\n\nAll, however, upbraided the Libyans, who alone had been paid. But while\nnational antipathies revived, together with personal hatreds, it was\nfelt that it would be perilous to give way to them. Reprisals after\nsuch an outrage would be formidable. It was necessary, therefore, to\nanticipate the vengeance of Carthage. Conventions and harangues never\nceased. Every one spoke, no one was listened to; Spendius, usually so\nloquacious, shook his head at every proposal.\n\nOne evening he asked Matho carelessly whether there were not springs in\nthe interior of the town.\n\n\"Not one!\" replied Matho.\n\nThe next day Spendius drew him aside to the bank of the lake.\n\n\"Master!\" said the former slave, \"If your heart is dauntless, I will\nbring you into Carthage.\"\n\n\"How?\" repeated the other, panting.\n\n\"Swear to execute all my commands and to follow me like a shadow!\"\n\nThen Matho, raising his arm towards the planet of Chabar, exclaimed:\n\n\"By Tanith, I swear!\"\n\nSpendius resumed:\n\n\"To-morrow after sunset you will wait for me at the foot of the aqueduct\nbetween the ninth and tenth arcades. Bring with you an iron pick, a\ncrestless helmet, and leathern sandals.\"\n\nThe aqueduct of which he spoke crossed the entire isthmus obliquely,--a\nconsiderable work, afterwards enlarged by the Romans. In spite of her\ndisdain of other nations, Carthage had awkwardly borrowed this novel\ninvention from them, just as Rome herself had built Punic galleys; and\nfive rows of superposed arches, of a dumpy kind of architecture, with\nbuttresses at their foot and lions' heads at the top, reached to the\nwestern part of the Acropolis, where they sank beneath the town to\nincline what was nearly a river into the cisterns of Megara.\n\nSpendius met Matho here at the hour agreed upon. He fastened a sort of\nharpoon to the end of a cord and whirled it rapidly like a sling; the\niron instrument caught fast, and they began to climb up the wall, the\none after the other.\n\nBut when they had ascended to the first story the cramp fell back every\ntime that they threw it, and in order to discover some fissure they had\nto walk along the edge of the cornice. At every row of arches they found\nthat it became narrower. Then the cord relaxed. Several times it nearly\nbroke.\n\nAt last they reached the upper platform. Spendius stooped down from time\nto time to feel the stones with his hand.\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said; \"let us begin!\" And leaning on the pick which\nMatho had brought they succeeded in dislodging one of the flagstones.\n\nIn the distance they perceived a troop of horse-men galloping on horses\nwithout bridles. Their golden bracelets leaped in the vague drapings\nof their cloaks. A man could be seen in front crowned with ostrich\nfeathers, and galloping with a lance in each hand.\n\n\"Narr' Havas!\" exclaimed Matho.\n\n\"What matter?\" returned Spendius, and he leaped into the hole which they\nhad just made by removing the flagstone.\n\nMatho at his command tried to thrust out one of the blocks. But he could\nnot move his elbows for want of room.\n\n\"We shall return,\" said Spendius; \"go in front.\" Then they ventured into\nthe channel of water.\n\nIt reached to their waists. Soon they staggered, and were obliged to\nswim. Their limbs knocked against the walls of the narrow duct. The\nwater flowed almost immediately beneath the stones above, and their\nfaces were torn by them. Then the current carried them away. Their\nbreasts were crushed with air heavier than that of a sepulchre, and\nstretching themselves out as much as possible with their heads between\ntheir arms and their legs close together, they passed like arrows into\nthe darkness, choking, gurgling, and almost dead. Suddenly all became\nblack before them, and the speed of the waters redoubled. They fell.\n\nWhen they came to the surface again, they remained for a few minutes\nextended on their backs, inhaling the air delightfully. Arcades, one\nbehind another, opened up amid large walls separating the various\nbasins. All were filled, and the water stretched in a single sheet\nthroughout the length of the cisterns. Through the air-holes in the\ncupolas on the ceiling there fell a pale brightness which spread upon\nthe waves discs, as it were, of light, while the darkness round about\nthickened towards the walls and threw them back to an indefinite\ndistance. The slightest sound made a great echo.\n\nSpendius and Matho commenced to swim again, and passing through the\nopening of the arches, traversed several chambers in succession. Two\nother rows of smaller basins extended in a parallel direction on each\nside. They lost themselves; they turned, and came back again. At last\nsomething offered a resistance to their heels. It was the pavement of\nthe gallery that ran along the cisterns.\n\nThen, advancing with great precautions, they felt along the wall to\nfind an outlet. But their feet slipped, and they fell into the great\ncentre-basins. They had to climb up again, and there they fell again.\nThey experienced terrible fatigue, which made them feel as if all their\nlimbs had been dissolved in the water while swimming. Their eyes closed;\nthey were in the agonies of death.\n\nSpendius struck his hand against the bars of a grating. They shook it,\nit gave way, and they found themselves on the steps of a staircase. A\ndoor of bronze closed it above. With the point of a dagger they moved\nthe bar, which was opened from without, and suddenly the pure open air\nsurrounded them.\n\nThe night was filled with silence, and the sky seemed at an\nextraordinary height. Clusters of trees projected over the long lines of\nwalls. The whole town was asleep. The fires of the outposts shone like\nlost stars.\n\nSpendius, who had spent three years in the ergastulum, was but\nimperfectly acquainted with the different quarters. Matho conjectured\nthat to reach Hamilcar's palace they ought to strike to the left and\ncross the Mappalian district.\n\n\"No,\" said Spendius, \"take me to the temple of Tanith.\"\n\nMatho wished to speak.\n\n\"Remember!\" said the former slave, and raising his arm he showed him the\nglittering planet of Chabar.\n\nThen Matho turned in silence towards the Acropolis.\n\nThey crept along the nopal hedges which bordered the paths. The water\ntrickled from their limbs upon the dust. Their damp sandals made no\nnoise; Spendius, with eyes that flamed more than torches, searched the\nbushes at every step;--and he walked behind Matho with his hands resting\non the two daggers which he carried on his arms, and which hung from\nbelow the armpit by a leathern band.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTANITH\n\nAfter leaving the gardens Matho and Spendius found themselves checked\nby the rampart of Megara. But they discovered a breach in the great wall\nand passed through.\n\nThe ground sloped downwards, forming a kind of very broad valley. It was\nan exposed place.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Spendius, \"and first of all fear nothing! I shall fulfil\nmy promise--\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, and seemed to reflect as though searching for\nwords,--\"Do you remember that time at sunrise when I showed Carthage to\nyou on Salammbo's terrace? We were strong that day, but you would listen\nto nothing!\" Then in a grave voice: \"Master, in the sanctuary of Tanith\nthere is a mysterious veil, which fell from heaven and which covers the\ngoddess.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Matho.\n\nSpendius resumed: \"It is itself divine, for it forms part of her. The\ngods reside where their images are. It is because Carthage possesses\nit that Carthage is powerful.\" Then leaning over to his ear: \"I have\nbrought you with me to carry it off!\"\n\nMatho recoiled in horror. \"Begone! look for some one else! I will not\nhelp you in this execrable crime!\"\n\n\"But Tanith is your enemy,\" retorted Spendius; \"she is persecuting you\nand you are dying through her wrath. You will be revenged upon her. She\nwill obey you, and you will become almost immortal and invincible.\"\n\nMatho bent his head. Spendius continued:\n\n\"We should succumb; the army would be annihilated of itself. We have\nneither flight, nor succour, nor pardon to hope for! What chastisement\nfrom the gods can you be afraid of since you will have their power in\nyour own hands? Would you rather die on the evening of a defeat, in\nmisery beneath the shelter of a bush, or amid the outrages of the\npopulace and the flames of funeral piles? Master, one day you will enter\nCarthage among the colleges of the pontiffs, who will kiss your sandals;\nand if the veil of Tanith weighs upon you still, you will reinstate it\nin its temple. Follow me! come and take it.\"\n\nMatho was consumed by a terrible longing. He would have liked to possess\nthe veil while refraining from the sacrilege. He said to himself that\nperhaps it would not be necessary to take it in order to monopolise its\nvirtue. He did not go to the bottom of his thought but stopped at the\nboundary, where it terrified him.\n\n\"Come on!\" he said; and they went off with rapid strides, side by side,\nand without speaking.\n\nThe ground rose again, and the dwellings were near. They turned again\ninto the narrow streets amid the darkness. The strips of esparto-grass\nwith which the doors were closed, beat against the walls. Some camels\nwere ruminating in a square before heaps of cut grass. Then they passed\nbeneath a gallery covered with foliage. A pack of dogs were barking. But\nsuddenly the space grew wider and they recognised the western face of\nthe Acropolis. At the foot of Byrsa there stretched a long black mass:\nit was the temple of Tanith, a whole made up of monuments and galleries,\ncourts and fore-courts, and bounded by a low wall of dry stones.\nSpendius and Matho leaped over it.\n\nThis first barrier enclosed a wood of plane-trees as a precaution\nagainst plague and infection in the air. Tents were scattered here\nand there, in which, during the daytime, depilatory pastes,\nperfumes, garments, moon-shaped cakes, and images of the goddess with\nrepresentations of the temple hollowed out in blocks of alabaster, were\non sale.\n\nThey had nothing to fear, for on nights when the planet did not appear,\nall rites were suspended; nevertheless Matho slackened his speed, and\nstopped before the three ebony steps leading to the second enclosure.\n\n\"Forward!\" said Spendius.\n\nPomegranate, almond trees, cypresses and myrtles alternated in regular\nsuccession; the path, which was paved with blue pebbles, creaked beneath\ntheir footsteps, and full-blown roses formed a hanging bower over the\nwhole length of the avenue. They arrived before an oval hole protected\nby a grating. Then Matho, who was frightened by the silence, said to\nSpendius:\n\n\"It is here that they mix the fresh water and the bitter.\"\n\n\"I have seen all that,\" returned the former slave, \"in Syria, in\nthe town of Maphug\"; and they ascended into the third enclosure by a\nstaircase of six silver steps.\n\nA huge cedar occupied the centre. Its lowest branches were hidden\nbeneath scraps of material and necklaces hung upon them by the faithful.\nThey walked a few steps further on, and the front of the temple was\ndisplayed before them.\n\nTwo long porticoes, with their architraves resting on dumpy pillars,\nflanked a quadrangular tower, the platform of which was adorned with\nthe crescent of a moon. On the angles of the porticoes and at the four\ncorners of the tower stood vases filled with kindled aromatics. The\ncapitals were laden with pomegranates and coloquintidas. Twining knots,\nlozenges, and rows of pearls alternated on the walls, and a hedge of\nsilver filigree formed a wide semicircle in front of the brass staircase\nwhich led down from the vestibule.\n\nThere was a cone of stone at the entrance between a stela of gold and\none of emerald, and Matho kissed his right hand as he passed beside it.\n\nThe first room was very lofty; its vaulted roof was pierced by\nnumberless apertures, and if the head were raised the stars might be\nseen. All round the wall rush baskets were heaped up with the first\nfruits of adolescence in the shape of beards and curls of hair; and in\nthe centre of the circular apartment the body of a woman issued from a\nsheath which was covered with breasts. Fat, bearded, and with eyelids\ndowncast, she looked as though she were smiling, while her hands were\ncrossed upon the lower part of her big body, which was polished by the\nkisses of the crowd.\n\nThen they found themselves again in the open air in a transverse\ncorridor, wherein there was an altar of small dimensions leaning against\nan ivory door. There was no further passage; the priests alone could\nopen it; for the temple was not a place of meeting for the multitude,\nbut the private abode of a divinity.\n\n\"The enterprise is impossible,\" said Matho. \"You had not thought of\nthis! Let us go back!\" Spendius was examining the walls.\n\nHe wanted the veil, not because he had confidence in its virtue\n(Spendius believed only in the Oracle), but because he was persuaded\nthat the Carthaginians would be greatly dismayed on seeing themselves\ndeprived of it. They walked all round behind in order to find some\noutlet.\n\nAedicules of different shapes were visible beneath clusters of\nturpentine trees. Here and there rose a stone phallus, and large stags\nroamed peacefully about, spurning the fallen fir-cones with their cloven\nhoofs.\n\nBut they retraced their steps between two long galleries which ran\nparallel to each other. There were small open cells along their sides,\nand tabourines and cymbals hung against their cedar columns from top to\nbottom. Women were sleeping stretched on mats outside the cells. Their\nbodies were greasy with unguents, and exhaled an odour of spices and\nextinguished perfuming-pans; while they were so covered with tattooings,\nnecklaces, rings, vermilion, and antimony that, but for the motion of\ntheir breasts, they might have been taken for idols as they lay thus on\nthe ground. There were lotus-trees encircling a fountain in which fish\nlike Salammbo's were swimming; and then in the background, against the\nwall of the temple, spread a vine, the branches of which were of glass\nand the grape-bunches of emerald, the rays from the precious stones\nmaking a play of light through the painted columns upon the sleeping\nfaces.\n\nMatho felt suffocated in the warm atmosphere pressed down upon him by\nthe cedar partitions. All these symbols of fecundation, these perfumes,\nradiations, and breathings overwhelmed him. Through all the mystic\ndazzling he kept thinking of Salammbo. She became confused with the\ngoddess herself, and his loved unfolded itself all the more, like the\ngreat lotus-plants blooming upon the depths of the waters.\n\nSpendius was calculating how much money he would have made in former\ndays by the sale of these women; and with a rapid glance he estimated\nthe weight of the golden necklaces as he passed by.\n\nThe temple was impenetrable on this side as on the other, and they\nreturned behind the first chamber. While Spendius was searching and\nferreting, Matho was prostrate before the door supplicating Tanith. He\nbesought her not to permit the sacrilege, and strove to soften her with\ncaressing words, such as are used to an angry person.\n\nSpendius noticed a narrow aperture above the door.\n\n\"Rise!\" he said to Matho, and he made him stand erect with his back\nagainst the wall. Placing one foot in his hands, and then the other\nupon his head, he reached up to the air-hole, made his way into it and\ndisappeared. Then Matho felt a knotted cord--that one which Spendius\nhad rolled around his body before entering the cisterns--fall upon his\nshoulders, and bearing upon it with both hands he soon found himself by\nthe side of the other in a large hall filled with shadow.\n\nSuch an attempt was something extraordinary. The inadequacy of the\nmeans for preventing it was a sufficient proof that it was considered\nimpossible. The sanctuaries were protected by terror more than by their\nwalls. Matho expected to die at every step.\n\nHowever a light was flickering far back in the darkness, and they went\nup to it. It was a lamp burning in a shell on the pedestal of a statue\nwhich wore the cap of the Kabiri. Its long blue robe was strewn with\ndiamond discs, and its heels were fastened to the ground by chains which\nsank beneath the pavement. Matho suppressed a cry. \"Ah! there she is!\nthere she is!\" he stammered out. Spendius took up the lamp in order to\nlight himself.\n\n\"What an impious man you are!\" murmured Matho, following him\nnevertheless.\n\nThe apartment which they entered had nothing in it but a black painting\nrepresenting another woman. Her legs reached to the top of the wall, and\nher body filled the entire ceiling; a huge egg hung by a thread from her\nnavel, and she fell head downwards upon the other wall, reaching as far\nas the level of the pavement, which was touched by her pointed fingers.\n\nThey drew a hanging aside, in order to go on further; but the wind blew\nand the light went out.\n\nThen they wandered about, lost in the complications of the architecture.\nSuddenly they felt something strangely soft beneath their feet. Sparks\ncrackled and leaped; they were walking in fire. Spendius touched the\nground and perceived that it was carefully carpeted with lynx skins;\nthen it seemed to them that a big cord, wet, cold, and viscous, was\ngliding between their legs. Through some fissures cut in the wall there\nfell thin white rays, and they advanced by this uncertain light. At last\nthey distinguished a large black serpent. It darted quickly away and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Let us fly!\" exclaimed Matho. \"It is she! I feel her; she is coming.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Spendius, \"the temple is empty.\"\n\nThen a dazzling light made them lower their eyes. Next they perceived\nall around them an infinite number of beasts, lean, panting, with\nbristling claws, and mingled together one above another in a mysterious\nand terrifying confusion. There were serpents with feet, and bulls\nwith wings, fishes with human heads were devouring fruit, flowers were\nblooming in the jaws of crocodiles, and elephants with uplifted trunks\nwere sailing proudly through the azure like eagles. Their incomplete or\nmultiplied limbs were distended with terrible exertion. As they thrust\nout their tongues they looked as though they would fain give forth\ntheir souls; and every shape was to be found among them as if the\ngerm-receptacle had been suddenly hatched and had burst, emptying itself\nupon the walls of the hall.\n\nRound the latter were twelve globes of blue crystal, supported by\nmonsters resembling tigers. Their eyeballs were starting out of their\nheads like those of snails, with their dumpy loins bent they were\nturning round towards the background where the supreme Rabbet, the\nOmnifecund, the last invented, shone splendid in a chariot of ivory.\n\nShe was covered with scales, feathers, flowers, and birds as high as the\nwaist. For earrings she had silver cymbals, which flapped against her\ncheeks. Her large fixed eyes gazed upon you, and a luminous stone,\nset in an obscene symbol on her brow, lighted the whole hall by its\nreflection in red copper mirrors above the door.\n\nMatho stood a step forward; but a flag stone yielded beneath his heels\nand immediately the spheres began to revolve and the monsters to roar;\nmusic rose melodious and pealing, like the harmony of the planets; the\ntumultuous soul of Tanith was poured streaming forth. She was about to\narise, as lofty as the hall and with open arms. Suddenly the monsters\nclosed their jaws and the crystal globes revolved no more.\n\nThen a mournful modulation lingered for a time through the air and at\nlast died away.\n\n\"And the veil?\" said Spendius.\n\nNowhere could it be seen. Where was it to be found? How could it be\ndiscovered? What if the priests had hidden it? Matho experienced anguish\nof heart and felt as though he had been deceived in his belief.\n\n\"This way!\" whispered Spendius. An inspiration guided him. He drew Matho\nbehind Tanith's chariot, where a cleft a cubit wide ran down the wall\nfrom top to bottom.\n\nThen they penetrated into a small and completely circular room, so lofty\nthat it was like the interior of a pillar. In the centre there was a\nbig black stone, of semispherical shape like a tabourine; flames were\nburning upon it; an ebony cone, bearing a head and two arms, rose\nbehind.\n\nBut beyond it seemed as though there were a cloud wherein were twinkling\nstars; faces appeared in the depths of its folds--Eschmoun with the\nKabiri, some of the monsters that had already been seen, the sacred\nbeasts of the Babylonians, and others with which they were not\nacquainted. It passed beneath the idol's face like a mantle, and spread\nfully out was drawn up on the wall to which it was fastened by the\ncorners, appearing at once bluish as the night, yellow as the dawn,\npurple as the sun, multitudinous, diaphanous, sparkling light. It was\nthe mantle of the goddess, the holy zaimph which might not be seen.\n\nBoth turned pale.\n\n\"Take it!\" said Matho at last.\n\nSpendius did not hesitate, and leaning upon the idol he unfastened the\nveil, which sank to the ground. Matho laid his hand upon it; then he put\nhis head through the opening, then he wrapped it about his body, and he\nspread out his arms the better to view it.\n\n\"Let us go!\" said Spendius.\n\nMatho stood panting with his eyes fixed upon the pavement. Suddenly he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"But what if I went to her? I fear her beauty no longer! What could she\ndo to me? I am now more than a man. I could pass through flames or walk\nupon the sea! I am transported! Salammbo! Salammbo! I am your master!\"\n\nHis voice was like thunder. He seemed to Spendius to have grown taller\nand transformed.\n\nA sound of footsteps drew near, a door opened, and a man appeared, a\npriest with lofty cap and staring eyes. Before he could make a gesture\nSpendius had rushed upon him, and clasping him in his arms had buried\nboth his daggers in his sides. His head rang upon the pavement.\n\nThen they stood for a while, as motionless as the corpse, listening.\nNothing could be heard but the murmuring of the wind through the\nhalf-opened door.\n\nThe latter led into a narrow passage. Spendius advanced along it, Matho\nfollowed him, and they found themselves almost immediately in the third\nenclosure, between the lateral porticoes, in which were the dwellings of\nthe priests.\n\nBehind the cells there must be a shorter way out. They hastened along.\n\nSpendius squatted down at the edge of the fountain and washed his\nbloodstained hands. The women slept. The emerald vine shone. They\nresumed their advance.\n\nBut something was running behind them under the trees; and Matho, who\nbore the veil, several times felt that it was being pulled very gently\nfrom below. It was a large cynocephalus, one of those which dwelt at\nliberty within the enclosure of the goddess. It clung to the mantle as\nthough it had been conscious of the theft. They did not dare to strike\nit, however, fearing that it might redouble its cries; suddenly its\nanger subsided, and it trotted close beside them swinging its body with\nits long hanging arms. Then at the barrier it leaped at a bound into a\npalm tree.\n\nWhen they had left the last enclosure they directed their steps towards\nHamilcar's palace, Spendius understanding that it would be useless to\ntry to dissuade Matho.\n\nThey went by the street of the Tanners, the square of Muthumbal, the\ngreen market and the crossways of Cynasyn. At the angle of a wall a man\ndrew back frightened by the sparkling thing which pierced the darkness.\n\n\"Hide the zaimph!\" said Spendius.\n\nOther people passed them, but without perceiving them.\n\nAt last they recognised the houses of Megara.\n\nThe pharos, which was built behind them on the summit of the cliff,\nlit up the heavens with a great red brightness, and the shadow of the\npalace, with its rising terraces, projected a monstrous pyramid, as it\nwere, upon the gardens. They entered through the hedge of jujube-trees,\nbeating down the branches with blows of the dagger.\n\nThe traces of the feast of the Mercenaries were everywhere still\nmanifest. The parks were broken up, the trenches drained, the doors\nof the ergastulum open. No one was to be seen about the kitchens or\ncellars. They wondered at the silence, which was occasionally broken by\nthe hoarse breathing of the elephants moving in their shackles, and the\ncrepitation of the pharos, in which a pile of aloes was burning.\n\nMatho, however, kept repeating:\n\n\"But where is she? I wish to see her! Lead me!\"\n\n\"It is a piece of insanity!\" Spendius kept saying. \"She will call, her\nslaves will run up, and in spite of your strength you will die!\"\n\nThey reached thus the galley staircase. Matho raised his head, and\nthought that he could perceive far above a vague brightness, radiant and\nsoft. Spendius sought to restrain him, but he dashed up the steps.\n\nAs he found himself again in places where he had already seen her, the\ninterval of the days that had passed was obliterated from his memory.\nBut now had she been singing among the tables; she had disappeared, and\nhe had since been continually ascending this staircase. The sky above\nhis head was covered with fires; the sea filled the horizon; at each\nstep he was surrounded by a still greater immensity, and he continued to\nclimb upward with that strange facility which we experience in dreams.\n\nThe rustling of the veil as it brushed against the stones recalled his\nnew power to him; but in the excess of his hope he could no longer tell\nwhat he was to do; this uncertainty alarmed him.\n\nFrom time to time he would press his face against the quadrangular\nopenings in the closed apartments, and he thought that in several of the\nlatter he could see persons asleep.\n\nThe last story, which was narrower, formed a sort of dado on the summit\nof the terraces. Matho walked round it slowly.\n\nA milky light filled the sheets of talc which closed the little\napertures in the wall, and in their symmetrical arrangement they looked\nin the darkness like rows of delicate pearls. He recognised the red door\nwith the black cross. The throbbing of his heart increased. He would\nfain have fled. He pushed the door and it opened.\n\nA galley-shaped lamp hung burning in the back part of the room,\nand three rays, emitted from its silver keel, trembled on the lofty\nwainscots, which were painted red with black bands. The ceiling was an\nassemblage of small beams, with amethysts and topazes amid their gilding\nin the knots of the wood. On both the great sides of the apartment there\nstretched a very low bed made with white leathern straps; while above,\nsemi-circles like shells, opened in the thickness of the wall, suffered\na garment to come out and hang down to the ground.\n\nThere was an oval basin with a step of onyx round it; delicate slippers\nof serpent skin were standing on the edge, together with an alabaster\nflagon. The trace of a wet footstep might be seen beyond. Exquisite\nscents were evaporating.\n\nMatho glided over the pavement, which was encrusted with gold,\nmother-of-pearl, and glass; and, in spite of the polished smoothness\nof the ground, it seemed to him that his feet sank as though he were\nwalking on sand.\n\nBehind the silver lamp he had perceived a large square of azure held in\nthe air by four cords from above, and he advanced with loins bent and\nmouth open.\n\nFlamingoes' wings, fitted on branches of black coral, lay about\namong purple cushions, tortoiseshell strigils, cedar boxes, and ivory\nspatulas. There were antelopes' horns with rings and bracelets strung\nupon them; and clay vases were cooling in the wind in the cleft of the\nwall with a lattice-work of reeds. Several times he struck his foot,\nfor the ground had various levels of unequal height, which formed a\nsuccession of apartments, as it were, in the room. In the background\nthere were silver balustrades surrounding a carpet strewn with painted\nflowers. At last he came to the hanging bed beside an ebony stool\nserving to get into it.\n\nBut the light ceased at the edge;--and the shadow, like a great curtain,\nrevealed only a corner of the red mattress with the extremity of a\nlittle naked foot lying upon its ankle. Then Matho took up the lamp very\ngently.\n\nShe was sleeping with her cheek in one hand and with the other arm\nextended. Her ringlets were spread about her in such abundance that she\nappeared to be lying on black feathers, and her ample white tunic wound\nin soft draperies to her feet following the curves of her person. Her\neyes were just visible beneath her half-closed eyelids. The curtains,\nwhich stretched perpendicularly, enveloped her in a bluish atmosphere,\nand the motion of her breathing, communicating itself to the cords,\nseemed to rock her in the air. A long mosquito was buzzing.\n\nMatho stood motionless holding the silver lamp at arm's length; but on a\nsudden the mosquito-net caught fire and disappeared, and Salammbo awoke.\n\nThe fire had gone out of itself. She did not speak. The lamp caused\ngreat luminous moires to flicker on the wainscots.\n\n\"What is it?\" she said.\n\nHe replied:\n\n\"'Tis the veil of the goddess!\"\n\n\"The veil of the goddess!\" cried Salammbo, and supporting herself on\nboth clenched hands she leaned shuddering out. He resumed:\n\n\"I have been in the depths of the sanctuary to seek it for you! Look!\"\nThe Zaimph shone a mass of rays.\n\n\"Do you remember it?\" said Matho. \"You appeared at night in my dreams,\nbut I did not guess the mute command of your eyes!\" She put out one foot\nupon the ebony stool. \"Had I understood I should have hastened hither, I\nshould have forsaken the army, I should not have left Carthage. To obey\nyou I would go down through the caverns of Hadrumetum into the kingdom\nof the shades!--Forgive me! it was as though mountains were weighing\nupon my days; and yet something drew me on! I tried to come to you!\nShould I ever have dared this without the Gods!--Let us go! You must\nfollow me! or, if you do not wish to do so, I will remain. What matters\nit to me!--Drown my soul in your breath! Let my lips be crushed with\nkissing your hands!\"\n\n\"Let me see it!\" she said. \"Nearer! nearer!\"\n\nDay was breaking, and the sheets of talc in the walls were filled with a\nvinous colour. Salammbo leaned fainting against the cushions of the bed.\n\n\"I love you!\" cried Matho.\n\n\"Give it!\" she stammered out, and they drew closer together.\n\nShe kept advancing, clothed in her white trailing simar, and with her\nlarge eyes fastened on the veil. Matho gazed at her, dazzled by the\nsplendours of her head, and, holding out the zaimph towards her, was\nabout to enfold her in an embrace. She was stretching out her\narms. Suddenly she stopped, and they stood looking at each other,\nopen-mouthed.\n\nThen without understanding the meaning of his solicitation a horror\nseized upon her. Her delicate eyebrows rose, her lips opened; she\ntrembled. At last she struck one of the brass pateras which hung at the\ncorners of the red mattress, crying:\n\n\"To the rescue! to the rescue! Back, sacrilegious man! infamous and\naccursed! Help, Taanach, Kroum, Ewa, Micipsa, Schaoul!\"\n\nAnd the scared face of Spendius, appearing in the wall between the clay\nflagons, cried out these words:\n\n\"Fly! they are hastening hither!\"\n\nA great tumult came upwards shaking the staircases, and a flood of\npeople, women, serving-men, and slaves, rushed into the room with\nstakes, tomahawks, cutlasses, and daggers. They were nearly paralysed\nwith indignation on perceiving a man; the female servants uttered\nfuneral wailings, and the eunuchs grew pale beneath their black skins.\n\nMatho was standing behind the balustrades. With the zaimph which was\nwrapped about him, he looked like a sidereal god surrounded by the\nfirmament. The slaves were going to fall upon him, but she stopped them:\n\n\"Touch it not! It is the mantle of the goddess!\"\n\nShe had drawn back into a corner; but she took a step towards him, and\nstretched forth her naked arm:\n\n\"A curse upon you, you who have plundered Tanith! Hatred, vengeance,\nmassacre, and grief! May Gurzil, god of battles, rend you! may Mastiman,\ngod of the dead, stifle you! and may the Other--he who may not be\nnamed--burn you!\"\n\nMatho uttered a cry as though he had received a sword-thrust. She\nrepeated several times: \"Begone! begone!\"\n\nThe crowd of servants spread out, and Matho, with hanging head, passed\nslowly through the midst of them; but at the door he stopped, for the\nfringe of the zaimph had caught on one of the golden stars with which\nthe flagstones were paved. He pulled it off abruptly with a movement of\nhis shoulder and went down the staircases.\n\nSpendius, bounding from terrace to terrace, and leaping over the hedges\nand trenches, had escaped from the gardens. He reached the foot of the\npharos. The wall was discontinued at this spot, so inaccessible was the\ncliff. He advanced to the edge, lay down on his back, and let himself\nslide, feet foremost, down the whole length of it to the bottom; then\nby swimming he reached the Cape of the Tombs, made a wide circuit of the\nsalt lagoon, and re-entered the camp of the Barbarians in the evening.\n\nThe sun had risen; and, like a retreating lion, Matho went down the\npaths, casting terrible glances about him.\n\nA vague clamour reached his ears. It had started from the palace, and it\nwas beginning afresh in the distance, towards the Acropolis. Some said\nthat the treasure of the Republic had been seized in the temple of\nMoloch; others spoke of the assassination of a priest. It was thought,\nmoreover, that the Barbarians had entered the city.\n\nMatho, who did not know how to get out of the enclosures, walked\nstraight before him. He was seen, and an outcry was raised. Every one\nunderstood; and there was consternation, then immense wrath.\n\nFrom the bottom of the Mappalian quarter, from the heights of the\nAcropolis, from the catacombs, from the borders of the lake, the\nmultitude came in haste. The patricians left their palaces, and the\ntraders left their shops; the women forsook their children; swords,\nhatchets, and sticks were seized; but the obstacle which had stayed\nSalammbo stayed them. How could the veil be taken back? The mere sight\nof it was a crime; it was of the nature of the gods, and contact with it\nwas death.\n\nThe despairing priests wrung their hands on the peristyles of the\ntemples. The guards of the Legion galloped about at random; the people\nclimbed upon the houses, the terraces, the shoulders of the colossuses,\nand the masts of the ships. He went on, nevertheless, and the rage, and\nthe terror also, increased at each of his steps; the streets cleared at\nhis approach, and the torrent of flying men streamed on both sides up\nto the tops of the walls. Everywhere he could perceive only eyes opened\nwidely as if to devour him, chattering teeth and outstretched fists, and\nSalammbo's imprecations resounded many times renewed.\n\nSuddenly a long arrow whizzed past, then another, and stones began to\nbuzz about him; but the missiles, being badly aimed (for there was the\ndread of hitting the zaimph), passed over his head. Moreover, he made a\nshield of the veil, holding it to the right, to the left, before him and\nbehind him; and they could devise no expedient. He quickened his steps\nmore and more, advancing through the open streets. They were barred\nwith cords, chariots, and snares; and all his windings brought him back\nagain. At last he entered the square of Khamon where the Balearians had\nperished, and stopped, growing pale as one about to die. This time he\nwas surely lost, and the multitude clapped their hands.\n\nHe ran up to the great gate, which was closed. It was very high, made\nthroughout of heart of oak, with iron nails and sheathed with brass.\nMatho flung himself against it. The people stamped their feet with joy\nwhen they saw the impotence of his fury; then he took his sandal, spit\nupon it, and beat the immovable panels with it. The whole city howled.\nThe veil was forgotten now, and they were about to crush him. Matho\ngazed with wide vacant eyes upon the crowd. His temples were throbbing\nwith violence enough to stun him, and he felt a numbness as of\nintoxication creeping over him. Suddenly he caught sight of the long\nchain used in working the swinging of the gate. With a bound he grasped\nit, stiffening his arms, and making a buttress of his feet, and at last\nthe huge leaves partly opened.\n\nThen when he was outside he took the great zaimph from his neck, and\nraised it as high as possible above his head. The material, upborne by\nthe sea breeze, shone in the sunlight with its colours, its gems, and\nthe figures of its gods. Matho bore it thus across the whole plain as\nfar as the soldiers' tents, and the people on the walls watched the\nfortune of Carthage depart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHANNO\n\n\"I ought to have carried her off!\" Matho said in the evening to\nSpendius. \"I should have seized her, and torn her from her house! No one\nwould have dared to touch me!\"\n\nSpendius was not listening to him. Stretched on his back he was taking\ndelicious rest beside a large jar filled with honey-coloured water, into\nwhich he would dip his head from time to time in order to drink more\ncopiously.\n\nMatho resumed:\n\n\"What is to be done? How can we re-enter Carthage?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Spendius.\n\nSuch impassibility exasperated Matho and he exclaimed:\n\n\"Why! the fault is yours! You carry me away, and then you forsake me,\ncoward that you are! Why, pray, should I obey you? Do you think that you\nare my master? Ah! you prostituter, you slave, you son of a slave!\" He\nground his teeth and raised his broad hand above Spendius.\n\nThe Greek did not reply. An earthen lamp was burning gently against the\ntent-pole, where the zaimph shone amid the hanging panoply. Suddenly\nMatho put on his cothurni, buckled on his brazen jacket of mail, and\ntook his helmet.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Spendius.\n\n\"I am returning! Let me alone! I will bring her back! And if they show\nthemselves I will crush them like vipers! I will put her to death,\nSpendius! Yes,\" he repeated, \"I will kill her! You shall see, I will\nkill her!\"\n\nBut Spendius, who was listening eagerly, snatched up the zaimph abruptly\nand threw it into a corner, heaping up fleeces above it. A murmuring of\nvoices was heard, torches gleamed, and Narr' Havas entered, followed by\nabout twenty men.\n\nThey wore white woollen cloaks, long daggers, copper necklaces, wooden\nearrings, and boots of hyena skin; and standing on the threshold they\nleaned upon their lances like herdsmen resting themselves. Narr' Havas\nwas the handsomest of all; his slender arms were bound with straps\nornamented with pearls. The golden circlet which fastened his ample\ngarment about his head held an ostrich feather which hung down behind\nhis shoulder; his teeth were displayed in a continual smile; his eyes\nseemed sharpened like arrows, and there was something observant and airy\nabout his whole demeanour.\n\nHe declared that he had come to join the Mercenaries, for the Republic\nhad long been threatening his kingdom. Accordingly he was interested in\nassisting the Barbarians, and he might also be of service to them.\n\n\"I will provide you with elephants (my forests are full of them),\nwine, oil, barley, dates, pitch and sulphur for sieges, twenty thousand\nfoot-soldiers and ten thousand horses. If I address myself to you,\nMatho, it is because the possession of the zaimph has made you chief man\nin the army. Moreover,\" he added, \"we are old friends.\"\n\nMatho, however, was looking at Spendius, who, seated on the sheep-skins,\nwas listening, and giving little nods of assent the while. Narr' Havas\ncontinued speaking. He called the gods to witness he cursed Carthage. In\nhis imprecations he broke a javelin. All his men uttered simultaneously\na loud howl, and Matho, carried away by so much passion, exclaimed that\nhe accepted the alliance.\n\nA white bull and a black sheep, the symbols of day and night, were then\nbrought, and their throats were cut on the edge of a ditch. When the\nlatter was full of blood they dipped their arms into it. Then Narr'\nHavas spread out his hand upon Matho's breast, and Matho did the same\nto Narr' Havas. They repeated the stain upon the canvas of their tents.\nAfterwards they passed the night in eating, and the remaining portions\nof the meat were burnt together with the skin, bones, horns, and hoofs.\n\nMatho had been greeted with great shouting when he had come back bearing\nthe veil of the goddess; even those who were not of the Chanaanitish\nreligion were made by their vague enthusiasm to feel the arrival of\na genius. As to seizing the zaimph, no one thought of it, for the\nmysterious manner in which he had acquired it was sufficient in the\nminds of the Barbarians to justify its possession; such were the\nthoughts of the soldiers of the African race. The others, whose hatred\nwas not of such long standing, did not know how to make up their minds.\nIf they had had ships they would immediately have departed.\n\nSpendius, Narr' Havas, and Matho despatched men to all the tribes on\nPunic soil.\n\nCarthage was sapping the strength of these nations. She wrung exorbitant\ntaxes from them, and arrears or even murmurings were punished with\nfetters, the axe, or the cross. It was necessary to cultivate whatever\nsuited the Republic, and to furnish what she demanded; no one had the\nright of possessing a weapon; when villages rebelled the inhabitants\nwere sold; governors were esteemed like wine-presses, according to the\nquantity which they succeeded in extracting. Then beyond the regions\nimmediately subject to Carthage extended the allies roamed the Nomads,\nwho might be let loose upon them. By this system the crops were always\nabundant, the studs skilfully managed, and the plantations superb.\n\nThe elder Cato, a master in the matters of tillage and slaves, was\namazed at it ninety-two years later, and the death-cry which he repeated\ncontinually at Rome was but the exclamation of jealous greed.\n\nDuring the last war the exactions had been increased, so that nearly\nall the towns of Libya had surrendered to Regulus. To punish them, a\nthousand talents, twenty thousand oxen, three hundred bags of gold dust,\nand considerable advances of grain had been exacted from them, and the\nchiefs of the tribes had been crucified or thrown to the lions.\n\nTunis especially execrated Carthage! Older than the metropolis, it could\nnot forgive her her greatness, and it fronted her walls crouching in\nthe mire on the water's edge like a venomous beast watching her.\nTransportation, massacres, and epidemics did not weaken it. It\nhad assisted Archagathas, the son of Agathocles, and the Eaters of\nUncleanness found arms there at once.\n\nThe couriers had not yet set out when universal rejoicing broke out\nin the provinces. Without waiting for anything they strangled the\ncomptrollers of the houses and the functionaries of the Republic in\nthe baths; they took the old weapons that had been concealed out of the\ncaves; they forged swords with the iron of the ploughs; the children\nsharpened javelins at the doors, and the women gave their necklaces,\nrings, earrings, and everything that could be employed for the\ndestruction of Carthage. Piles of lances were heaped up in the country\ntowns like sheaves of maize. Cattle and money were sent off. Matho\nspeedily paid the Mercenaries their arrears, and owing to this, which\nwas Spendius's idea, he was appointed commander-in-chief--the schalishim\nof the Barbarians.\n\nReinforcements of men poured in at the same time. The aborigines\nappeared first, and were followed by the slaves from the country;\ncaravans of Negroes were seized and armed, and merchants on their way\nto Carthage, despairing of any more certain profit, mingled with the\nBarbarians. Numerous bands were continually arriving. From the heights\nof the Acropolis the growing army might be seen.\n\nBut the guards of the Legion were posted as sentries on the platform\nof the aqueduct, and near them rose at intervals brazen vats, in which\nfloods of asphalt were boiling. Below in the plain the great crowd\nstirred tumultuously. They were in a state of uncertainty, feeling the\nembarrassment with which Barbarians are always inspired when they meet\nwith walls.\n\nUtica and Hippo-Zarytus refused their alliance. Phoenician colonies like\nCarthage, they were self-governing, and always had clauses inserted\nin the treaties concluded by the Republic to distinguish them from the\nlatter. Nevertheless they respected this strong sister of theirs who\nprotected them, and they did not think that she could be vanquished by\na mass of Barbarians; these would on the contrary be themselves\nexterminated. They desired to remain neutral and to live at peace.\n\nBut their position rendered them indispensable. Utica, at the foot\nof the gulf, was convenient for bringing assistance to Carthage from\nwithout. If Utica alone were taken, Hippo-Zarytus, six hours further\ndistant along the coast, would take its place, and the metropolis, being\nrevictualled in this way, would be impregnable.\n\nSpendius wished the siege to be undertaken immediately. Narr' Havas was\nopposed to this: an advance should first be made upon the frontier.\nThis was the opinion of the veterans, and of Matho himself, and it\nwas decided that Spendius should go to attack Utica, and Matho\nHippo-Zarytus, while in the third place the main body should rest on\nTunis and occupy the plain of Carthage, Autaritus being in command. As\nto Narr' Havas, he was to return to his own kingdom to procure elephants\nand to scour the roads with his cavalry.\n\nThe women cried out loudly against this decision; they coveted the\njewels of the Punic ladies. The Libyans also protested. They had been\nsummoned against Carthage, and now they were going away from it! The\nsoldiers departed almost alone. Matho commanded his own companions,\ntogether with the Iberians, Lusitanians, and the men of the West, and of\nthe islands; all those who spoke Greek had asked for Spendius on account\nof his cleverness.\n\nGreat was the stupefaction when the army was seen suddenly in motion;\nit stretched along beneath the mountain of Ariana on the road to Utica\nbeside the sea. A fragment remained before Tunis, the rest disappeared\nto re-appear on the other shore of the gulf on the outskirts of the\nwoods in which they were lost.\n\nThey were perhaps eighty thousand men. The two Tyrian cities would offer\nno resistance, and they would return against Carthage. Already there was\na considerable army attacking it from the base of the isthmus, and it\nwould soon perish from famine, for it was impossible to live without the\naid of the provinces, the citizens not paying contributions as they did\nat Rome. Carthage was wanting in political genius. Her eternal anxiety\nfor gain prevented her from having the prudence which results from\nloftier ambitions. A galley anchored on the Libyan sands, it was with\ntoil that she maintained her position. The nations roared like billows\naround her, and the slightest storm shook this formidable machine.\n\nThe treasury was exhausted by the Roman war and by all that had been\nsquandered and lost in the bargaining with the Barbarians. Nevertheless\nsoldiers must be had, and not a government would trust the Republic!\nPtolemaeus had lately refused it two thousand talents. Moreover the rape\nof the veil disheartened them. Spendius had clearly foreseen this.\n\nBut the nation, feeling that it was hated, clasped its money and\nits gods to its heart, and its patriotism was sustained by the very\nconstitution of its government.\n\nFirst, the power rested with all, without any one being strong enough\nto engross it. Private debts were considered as public debts, men of\nChanaanitish race had a monopoly of commerce, and by multiplying the\nprofits of piracy with those of usury, by hard dealings in lands and\nslaves and with the poor, fortunes were sometimes made. These alone\nopened up all the magistracies, and although authority and money were\nperpetuated in the same families, people tolerated the oligarchy because\nthey hoped ultimately to share in it.\n\nThe societies of merchants, in which the laws were elaborated, chose the\ninspectors of the exchequer, who on leaving office nominated the hundred\nmembers of the Council of the Ancients, themselves dependent on the\nGrand Assembly, or general gathering of all the rich. As to the two\nSuffets, the relics of the monarchy and the less than consuls, they were\ntaken from distinct families on the same day. All kinds of enmities were\ncontrived between them, so that they might mutually weaken each other.\nThey could not deliberate concerning war, and when they were vanquished\nthe Great Council crucified them.\n\nThe power of Carthage emanated, therefore, from the Syssitia, that is\nto say, from a large court in the centre of Malqua, at the place, it was\nsaid, where the first bark of Phoenician sailors had touched, the sea\nhaving retired a long way since then. It was a collection of little\nrooms of archaic architecture, built of palm trunks with corners of\nstone, and separated from one another so as to accommodate the various\nsocieties separately. The rich crowded there all day to discuss their\nown concerns and those of the government, from the procuring of pepper\nto the extermination of Rome. Thrice in a moon they would have their\nbeds brought up to the lofty terrace running along the wall of the\ncourt, and they might be seen from below at table in the air, without\ncothurni or cloaks, with their diamond-covered fingers wandering\nover the dishes, and their large earrings hanging down among the\nflagons,--all fat and lusty, half-naked, smiling and eating beneath the\nblue sky, like great sharks sporting in the sea.\n\nBut just now they were unable to dissemble their anxiety; they were too\npale for that. The crowd which waited for them at the gates escorted\nthem to their palaces in order to obtain some news from them. As in\ntimes of pestilence, all the houses were shut; the streets would fill\nand suddenly clear again; people ascended the Acropolis or ran to the\nharbour, and the Great Council deliberated every night. At last the\npeople were convened in the square of Khamon, and it was decided to\nleave the management of things to Hanno, the conqueror of Hecatompylos.\n\nHe was a true Carthaginian, devout, crafty, and pitiless towards the\npeople of Africa. His revenues equalled those of the Barcas. No one had\nsuch experience in administrative affairs.\n\nHe decreed the enrolment of all healthy citizens, he placed catapults on\nthe towers, he exacted exorbitant supplies of arms, he even ordered the\nconstruction of fourteen galleys which were not required, and he desired\neverything to be registered and carefully set down in writing. He had\nhimself conveyed to the arsenal, the pharos, and the treasuries of the\ntemples; his great litter was continually to be seen swinging from step\nto step as it ascended the staircases of the Acropolis. And then in\nhis palace at night, being unable to sleep, he would yell out warlike\nmanoeuvres in terrible tones so as to prepare himself for the fray.\n\nIn their extremity of terror all became brave. The rich ranged\nthemselves in line along the Mappalian district at cockcrow, and tucking\nup their robes practised themselves in handling the pike. But for\nwant of an instructor they had disputes about it. They would sit down\nbreathless upon the tombs and then begin again. Several even dieted\nthemselves. Some imagined that it was necessary to eat a great deal in\norder to acquire strength, while others who were inconvenienced by their\ncorpulence weakened themselves with fasts in order to become thin.\n\nUtica had already called several times upon Carthage for assistance; but\nHanno would not set out until the engines of war had been supplied with\nthe last screws. He lost three moons more in equipping the one hundred\nand twelve elephants that were lodged in the ramparts. They were the\nconquerors of Regulus; the people loved them; it was impossible to treat\nsuch old friends too well. Hanno had the brass plates which adorned\ntheir breasts recast, their tusks gilt, their towers enlarged, and\ncaparisons, edged with very heavy fringes, cut out of the handsomest\npurple. Finally, as their drivers were called Indians (after the first\nones, no doubt, who came from the Indies) he ordered them all to be\ncostumed after the Indian fashion; that is to say, with white pads round\ntheir temples, and small drawers of byssus, which with their transverse\nfolds looked like two valves of a shell applied to the hips.\n\nThe army under Autaritus still remained before Tunis. It was hidden\nbehind a wall made with mud from the lake, and protected on the top by\nthorny brushwood. Some Negroes had planted tall sticks here and there\nbearing frightful faces,--human masks made with birds' feathers, and\njackals' or serpents' heads,--which gaped towards the enemy for the\npurpose of terrifying him; and the Barbarians, reckoning themselves\ninvincible through these means, danced, wrestled, and juggled, convinced\nthat Carthage would perish before long. Any one but Hanno would easily\nhave crushed such a multitude, hampered as it was with herds and women.\nMoreover, they knew nothing of drill, and Autaritus was so disheartened\nthat he had ceased to require it.\n\nThey stepped aside when he passed by rolling his big blue eyes. Then\non reaching the edge of the lake he would draw back his sealskin cloak,\nunfasten the cord which tied up his long red hair, and soak the latter\nin the water. He regretted that he had not deserted to the Romans along\nwith the two thousand Gauls of the temple of Eryx.\n\nOften the sun would suddenly lose his rays in the middle of the day.\nThen the gulf and the open sea would seem as motionless as molten lead.\nA cloud of brown dust stretching perpendicularly would speed whirling\nalong; the palm trees would bend and the sky disappear, while stones\nwould be heard rebounding on the animals' cruppers; and the Gaul, his\nlips glued against the holes in his tent, would gasp with exhaustion and\nmelancholy. His thoughts would be of the scent of the pastures on autumn\nmornings, of snowflakes, or of the bellowing of the urus lost in the\nfog, and closing his eyelids he would in imagination behold the fires in\nlong, straw-roofed cottages flickering on the marshes in the depths of\nthe woods.\n\nOthers regretted their native lands as well as he, even though they\nmight not be so far away. Indeed the Carthaginian captives could\ndistinguish the velaria spread over the courtyards of their houses,\nbeyond the gulf on the slopes of Byrsa. But sentries marched round them\ncontinually. They were all fastened to a common chain. Each one wore an\niron carcanet, and the crowd was never weary of coming to gaze at them.\nThe women would show their little children the handsome robes hanging in\ntatters on their wasted limbs.\n\nWhenever Autaritus looked at Gisco he was seized with rage at the\nrecollection of the insult that he had received, and he would have\nkilled him but for the oath which he had taken to Narr' Havas. Then\nhe would go back into his tent and drink a mixture of barley and cumin\nuntil he swooned away from intoxication,--to awake afterwards in broad\ndaylight consumed with horrible thirst.\n\nMatho, meanwhile, was besieging Hippo-Zarytus. But the town was\nprotected by a lake, communicating with the sea. It had three lines of\ncircumvallation, and upon the heights which surrounded it there\nextended a wall fortified with towers. He had never commanded in such an\nenterprise before. Moreover, he was beset with thoughts of Salammbo, and\nhe raved in the delight of her beauty as in the sweetness of a vengeance\nthat transported him with pride. He felt an acrid, frenzied, permanent\nwant to see her again. He even thought of presenting himself as the\nbearer of a flag of truce, in the hope that once within Carthage he\nmight make his way to her. Often he would cause the assault to be\nsounded and waiting for nothing rush upon the mole which it was sought\nto construct in the sea. He would snatch up the stones with his hands,\noverturn, strike, and deal sword-thrusts everywhere. The Barbarians\nwould dash on pell-mell; the ladders would break with a loud crash, and\nmasses of men would tumble into the water, causing it to fly up in\nred waves against the walls. Finally the tumult would subside, and the\nsoldiers would retire to make a fresh beginning.\n\nMatho would go and seat himself outside the tents, wipe his\nblood-splashed face with his arm, and gaze at the horizon in the\ndirection of Carthage.\n\nIn front of him, among the olives, palms, myrtles and planes, stretched\ntwo broad ponds which met another lake, the outlines of which could not\nbe seen. Behind one mountain other mountains reared themselves, and\nin the middle of the immense lake rose an island perfectly black and\npyramidal in form. On the left, at the extremity of the gulf, were\nsand-heaps like arrested waves, large and pale, while the sea, flat as a\npavement of lapis-lazuli, ascended by insensible degrees to the edge\nof the sky. The verdure of the country was lost in places beneath long\nsheets of yellow; carobs were shining like knobs of coral; vine branches\ndrooped from the tops of the sycamores; the murmuring of the water could\nbe heard; crested larks were hopping about, and the sun's latest fires\ngilded the carapaces of the tortoises as they came forth from the reeds\nto inhale the breeze.\n\nMatho would heave deep sighs. He would lie flat on his face, with his\nnails buried in the soil, and weep; he felt wretched, paltry, forsaken.\nNever would he possess her, and he was unable even to take a town.\n\nAt night when alone in his tent he would gaze upon the zaimph. Of what\nuse to him was this thing which belonged to the gods?--and doubt crept\ninto the Barbarian's thoughts. Then, on the contrary, it would seem to\nhim that the vesture of the goddess was depending from Salammbo, and\nthat a portion of her soul hovered in it, subtler than a breath; and\nhe would feel it, breathe it in, bury his face in it, and kiss it with\nsobs. He would cover his shoulders with it in order to delude himself\nthat he was beside her.\n\nSometimes he would suddenly steal away, stride in the starlight over\nthe sleeping soldiers as they lay wrapped in their cloaks, spring upon\na horse on reaching the camp gates, and two hours later be at Utica in\nSpendius's tent.\n\nAt first he would speak of the siege, but his coming was only to ease\nhis sorrow by talking about Salammbo. Spendius exhorted him to be\nprudent.\n\n\"Drive away these trifles from your soul, which is degraded by them!\nFormerly you were used to obey; now you command an army, and if Carthage\nis not conquered we shall at least be granted provinces. We shall become\nkings!\"\n\nBut how was it that the possession of the zaimph did not give them the\nvictory? According to Spendius they must wait.\n\nMatho fancied that the veil affected people of Chanaanitish race\nexclusively, and, in his Barbarian-like subtlety, he said to himself:\n\"The zaimph will accordingly do nothing for me, but since they have lost\nit, it will do nothing for them.\"\n\nAfterwards a scruple troubled him. He was afraid of offending Moloch\nby worshipping Aptouknos, the god of the Libyans, and he timidly asked\nSpendius to which of the gods it would be advisable to sacrifice a man.\n\n\"Keep on sacrificing!\" laughed Spendius.\n\nMatho, who could not understand such indifference, suspected the Greek\nof having a genius of whom he did not speak.\n\nAll modes of worship, as well as all races, were to be met with in these\narmies of Barbarians, and consideration was had to the gods of others,\nfor they too, inspired fear. Many mingled foreign practices with their\nnative religion. It was to no purpose that they did not adore the stars;\nif a constellation were fatal or helpful, sacrifices were offered to\nit; an unknown amulet found by chance at a moment of peril became\na divinity; or it might be a name and nothing more, which would be\nrepeated without any attempt to understand its meaning. But after\npillaging temples, and seeing numbers of nations and slaughters, many\nultimately ceased to believe in anything but destiny and death;--and\nevery evening these would fall asleep with the placidity of wild beasts.\nSpendius had spit upon the images of Jupiter Olympius; nevertheless he\ndreaded to speak aloud in the dark, nor did he fail every day to put on\nhis right boot first.\n\nHe reared a long quadrangular terrace in front of Utica, but in\nproportion as it ascended the rampart was also heightened, and what was\nthrown down by the one side was almost immediately raised again by the\nother. Spendius took care of his men; he dreamed of plans and strove to\nrecall the stratagems which he had heard described in his travels. But\nwhy did Narr' Havas not return? There was nothing but anxiety.\n\nHanno had at last concluded his preparations. One night when there was\nno moon he transported his elephants and soldiers on rafts across\nthe Gulf of Carthage. Then they wheeled round the mountain of the Hot\nSprings so as to avoid Autaritus, and continued their march so slowly\nthat instead of surprising the Barbarians in the morning, as the Suffet\nhad calculated, they did not reach them until it was broad daylight on\nthe third day.\n\nUtica had on the east a plain which extended to the large lagoon of\nCarthage; behind it a valley ran at right angles between two low and\nabruptly terminated mountains; the Barbarians were encamped further\nto the left in such a way as to blockade the harbour; and they were\nsleeping in their tents (for on that day both sides were too weary\nto fight and were resting) when the Carthaginian army appeared at the\nturning of the hills.\n\nSome camp followers furnished with slings were stationed at intervals\non the wings. The first line was formed of the guards of the Legion in\ngolden scale-armour, mounted on their big horses, which were without\nmane, hair, or ears, and had silver horns in the middle of their\nforeheads to make them look like rhinoceroses. Between their squadrons\nwere youths wearing small helmets and swinging an ashen javelin in each\nhand. The long files of the heavy infantry marched behind. All these\ntraders had piled as many weapons upon their bodies as possible. Some\nmight be seen carrying an axe, a lance, a club, and two swords all at\nonce; others bristled with darts like porcupines, and their arms stood\nout from their cuirasses in sheets of horn or iron plates. At last the\nscaffoldings of the lofty engines appeared: carrobalistas, onagers,\ncatapults and scorpions, rocking on chariots drawn by mules and\nquadrigas of oxen; and in proportion as the army drew out, the captains\nran panting right and left to deliver commands, close up the files, and\npreserve the intervals. Such of the Ancients as held commands had come\nin purple cassocks, the magnificent fringes of which tangled in the\nwhite straps of their cothurni. Their faces, which were smeared all over\nwith vermilion, shone beneath enormous helmets surmounted with images\nof the gods; and, as they had shields with ivory borders covered with\nprecious stones, they might have been taken for suns passing over walls\nof brass.\n\nBut the Carthaginians manoeuvred so clumsily that the soldiers in\nderision urged them to sit down. They called out that they were just\ngoing to empty their big stomachs, to dust the gilding of their skin,\nand to give them iron to drink.\n\nA strip of green cloth appeared at the top of the pole planted before\nSpendius's tent: it was the signal. The Carthaginian army replied to\nit with a great noise of trumpets, cymbals, flutes of asses' bones, and\ntympanums. The Barbarians had already leaped outside the palisades, and\nwere facing their enemies within a javelin's throw of them.\n\nA Balearic slinger took a step forward, put one of his clay bullets into\nhis thong, and swung round his arm. An ivory shield was shivered, and\nthe two armies mingled together.\n\nThe Greeks made the horses rear and fall back upon their masters by\npricking their nostrils with the points of their lances. The slaves\nwho were to hurl stones had picked such as were too big, and they\naccordingly fell close to them. The Punic foot-soldiers exposed the\nright side in cutting with their long swords. The Barbarians broke their\nlines; they slaughtered them freely; they stumbled over the dying and\ndead, quite blinded by the blood that spurted into their faces. The\nconfused heap of pikes, helmets, cuirasses and swords turned round\nabout, widening out and closing in with elastic contractions. The gaps\nincreased more and more in the Carthaginian cohorts, the engines could\nnot get out of the sand; and finally the Suffet's litter (his grand\nlitter with crystal pendants), which from the beginning might have\nbeen seen tossing among the soldiers like a bark on the waves, suddenly\nfoundered. He was no doubt dead. The Barbarians found themselves alone.\n\nThe dust around them fell and they were beginning to sing, when Hanno\nhimself appeared on the top of an elephant. He sat bare-headed beneath a\nparasol of byssus which was carried by a Negro behind him. His necklace\nof blue plates flapped against the flowers on his black tunic; his huge\narms were compressed within circles of diamonds, and with open mouth he\nbrandished a pike of inordinate size, which spread out at the end like a\nlotus, and flashed more than a mirror. Immediately the earth shook,--and\nthe Barbarians saw all the elephants of Carthage, with their gilt tusks\nand blue-painted ears, hastening up in single line, clothed with bronze\nand shaking the leathern towers which were placed above their scarlet\ncaparisons, in each of which were three archers bending large bows.\n\nThe soldiers were barely in possession of their arms; they had taken\nup their positions at random. They were frozen with terror; they stood\nundecided.\n\nJavelins, arrows, phalaricas, and masses of lead were already being\nshowered down upon them from the towers. Some clung to the fringes of\nthe caparisons in order to climb up, but their hands were struck off\nwith cutlasses and they fell backwards upon the swords' points. The\npikes were too weak and broke, and the elephants passed through the\nphalanxes like wild boars through tufts of grass; they plucked up the\nstakes of the camp with their trunks, and traversed it from one end to\nthe other, overthrowing the tents with their breasts. All the Barbarians\nhad fled. They were hiding themselves in the hills bordering the valley\nby which the Carthaginians had come.\n\nThe victorious Hanno presented himself before the gates of Utica. He had\na trumpet sounded. The three Judges of the town appeared in the opening\nof the battlements on the summit of a tower.\n\nBut the people of Utica would not receive such well-armed guests. Hanno\nwas furious. At last they consented to admit him with a feeble escort.\n\nThe streets were too narrow for the elephants. They had to be left\noutside.\n\nAs soon as the Suffet was in the town the principal men came to greet\nhim. He had himself taken to the vapour baths, and called for his cooks.\n\nThree hours afterwards he was still immersed in the oil of cinnamomum\nwith which the basin had been filled; and while he bathed he ate\nflamingoes' tongues with honied poppy-seeds on a spread ox-hide.\nBeside him was his Greek physician, motionless, in a long yellow robe,\ndirecting the re-heating of the bath from time to time, and two young\nboys leaned over the steps of the basin and rubbed his legs. But\nattention to his body did not check his love for the commonwealth, for\nhe was dictating a letter to be sent to the Great Council, and as\nsome prisoners had just been taken he was asking himself what terrible\npunishment could be devised.\n\n\"Stop!\" said he to a slave who stood writing in the hollow of his hand.\n\"Let some of them be brought to me! I wish to see them!\"\n\nAnd from the bottom of the hall, full of a whitish vapour on which the\ntorches cast red spots, three Barbarians were thrust forward: a Samnite,\na Spartan, and a Cappadocian.\n\n\"Proceed!\" said Hanno.\n\n\"Rejoice, light of the Baals! your Suffet has exterminated the ravenous\nhounds! Blessings on the Republic! Give orders for prayers!\" He\nperceived the captives and burst out laughing: \"Ah! ha! my fine fellows\nof Sicca! You are not shouting so loudly to-day! It is I! Do you\nrecognise me? And where are your swords? What really terrible fellows!\"\nand he pretended to be desirous to hide himself as if he were afraid of\nthem. \"You demanded horses, women, estates, magistracies, no doubt, and\npriesthoods! Why not? Well, I will provide you with the estates, and\nsuch as you will never come out of! You shall be married to gibbets that\nare perfectly new! Your pay? it shall be melted in your mouths in leaden\ningots! and I will put you into good and very exalted positions among\nthe clouds, so as to bring you close to the eagles!\"\n\nThe three long-haired and ragged Barbarians looked at him without\nunderstanding what he said. Wounded in the knees, they had been seized\nby having ropes thrown over them, and the ends of the great chains on\ntheir hands trailed upon the pavement. Hanno was indignant at their\nimpassibility.\n\n\"On your knees! on your knees! jackals! dust! vermin! excrements! And\nthey make no reply! Enough! be silent! Let them be flayed alive! No!\npresently!\"\n\nHe was breathing like a hippopotamus and rolling his eyes. The perfumed\noil overflowed beneath the mass of his body, and clinging to the scales\non his skin, made it look pink in the light of the torches.\n\nHe resumed:\n\n\"For four days we suffered greatly from the sun. Some mules were lost\nin crossing the Macaras. In spite of their position, the extraordinary\ncourage--Ah! Demonades! how I suffer! Have the bricks reheated, and let\nthem be red-hot!\"\n\nA noise of rakes and furnaces was heard. The incense smoked more\nstrongly in the large perfuming pans, and the shampooers, who were quite\nnaked and were sweating like sponges, crushed a paste composed of wheat,\nsulphur, black wine, bitch's milk, myrrh, galbanum and storax upon his\njoints. He was consumed with incessant thirst, but the yellow-robed man\ndid not yield to this inclination, and held out to him a golden cup in\nwhich viper broth was smoking.\n\n\"Drink!\" said he, \"that strength of sun-born serpents may penetrate into\nthe marrow of your bones, and take courage, O reflection of the gods!\nYou know, moreover, that a priest of Eschmoun watches those cruel stars\nround the Dog from which your malady is derived. They are growing pale\nlike the spots on your skin, and you are not to die from them.\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, that is so, is it not?\" repeated the Suffet, \"I am not to die\nfrom them!\" And his violaceous lips gave forth a breath more nauseous\nthan the exhalation from a corpse. Two coals seemed to burn in the place\nof his eyes, which had lost their eyebrows; a mass of wrinkled skin\nhung over his forehead; both his ears stood out from his head and were\nbeginning to increase in size; and the deep lines forming semicircles\nround his nostrils gave him a strange and terrifying appearance, the\nlook of a wild beast. His unnatural voice was like a roar; he said:\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Demonades. In fact there are many ulcers here\nwhich have closed. I feel robust. Here! look how I am eating!\"\n\nAnd less from greediness than from ostentation, and the desire to prove\nto himself that he was in good health, he cut into the forcemeats\nof cheese and marjoram, the boned fish, gourds, oysters with eggs,\nhorse-radishes, truffles, and brochettes of small birds. As he looked\nat the prisoners he revelled in the imagination of their tortures.\nNevertheless he remembered Sicca, and the rage caused by all his woes\nfound vent in the abuse of these three men.\n\n\"Ah! traitors! ah! wretches! infamous, accursed creatures! And you\noutraged me!--me! the Suffet! Their services, the price of their\nblood, say they! Ah! yes! their blood! their blood!\" Then speaking to\nhimself:--\"All shall perish! not one shall be sold! It would be better\nto bring them to Carthage! I should be seen--but doubtless, I have not\nbrought chains enough? Write: Send me--How many of them are there? go\nand ask Muthumbal! Go! no pity! and let all their hands be cut off and\nbrought to me in baskets!\"\n\nBut strange cries at once hoarse and shrill penetrated into the hall\nabove Hanno's voice and the rattling of the dishes that were being\nplaced around him. They increased, and suddenly the furious trumpeting\nof the elephants burst forth as if the battle were beginning again. A\ngreat tumult was going on around the town.\n\nThe Carthaginians had not attempted to pursue the Barbarians. They had\ntaken up their quarters at the foot of the walls with their baggage,\nmules, serving men, and all their train of satraps; and they made\nmerry in their beautiful pearl-bordered tents, while the camp of the\nMercenaries was now nothing but a heap of ruins in the plain. Spendius\nhad recovered his courage. He dispatched Zarxas to Matho, scoured the\nwoods, rallied his men (the losses had been inconsiderable),--and they\nwere re-forming their lines enraged at having been conquered without a\nfight, when they discovered a vat of petroleum which had no doubt been\nabandoned by the Carthaginians. Then Spendius had some pigs carried off\nfrom the farms, smeared them with bitumen, set them on fire, and drove\nthem towards Utica.\n\nThe elephants were terrified by the flames and fled. The ground sloped\nupwards, javelins were thrown at them, and they turned back;--and\nwith great blows of ivory and trampling feet they ripped up the\nCarthaginians, stifled them, flattened them. The Barbarians descended\nthe hill behind them; the Punic camp, which was without entrenchments\nwas sacked at the first rush, and the Carthaginians were crushed against\nthe gates, which were not opened through fear of the Mercenaries.\n\nDay broke, and Matho's foot-soldiers were seen coming up from the west.\nAt the same time horsemen appeared; they were Narr' Havas with his\nNumidians. Leaping ravines and bushes they ran down the fugitives\nlike greyhounds pursuing hares. This change of fortune interrupted the\nSuffet. He called out to be assisted to leave the vapour bath.\n\nThe three captives were still before him. Then a Negro (the same who had\ncarried his parasol in the battle) leaned over to his ear.\n\n\"Well?\" replied the Suffet slowly. \"Ah! kill them!\" he added in an\nabrupt tone.\n\nThe Ethiopian drew a long dagger from his girdle and the three heads\nfell. One of them rebounded among the remains of the feast, and leaped\ninto the basin, where it floated for some time with open mouth and\nstaring eyes. The morning light entered through the chinks in the wall;\nthe three bodies streamed with great bubbles like three fountains, and\na sheet of blood flowed over the mosaics with their powdering of blue\ndust. The Suffet dipped his hand into this hot mire and rubbed his knees\nwith it: it was a cure.\n\nWhen evening had come he stole away from the town with his escort, and\nmade his way into the mountain to rejoin his army.\n\nHe succeeded in finding the remains of it.\n\nFour days afterward he was on the top of a defile at Gorza, when the\ntroops under Spendius appeared below. Twenty stout lances might easily\nhave checked them by attacking the head of their column, but the\nCarthaginians watched them pass by in a state of stupefaction. Hanno\nrecognised the king of the Numidians in the rearguard; Narr' Havas bowed\nto him, at the same time making a sign which he did not understand.\n\nThe return to Carthage took place amid all kinds of terrors. They\nmarched only at night, hiding in the olive woods during the day.\nThere were deaths at every halting-place; several times they believed\nthemselves lost. At last they reached Cape Hermaeum, where vessels came\nto receive them.\n\nHanno was so fatigued, so desperate--the loss of the elephants in\nparticular overwhelmed him--that he demanded poison from Demonades in\norder to put an end to it all. Moreover he could already feel himself\nstretched upon the cross.\n\nCarthage had not strength enough to be indignant with him. Its losses\nhad amounted to one hundred thousand nine hundred and seventy-two\nshekels of silver, fifteen thousand six hundred and twenty-three shekels\nof gold, eighteen elephants, fourteen members of the Great Council,\nthree hundred of the rich, eight thousand citizens, corn enough for\nthree moons, a considerable quantity of baggage, and all the engines\nof war! The defection of Narr' Havas was certain, and both sieges were\nbeginning again. The army under Autaritus now extended from Tunis to\nRhades. From the top of the Acropolis long columns of smoke might be\nseen in the country ascending to the sky; they were the mansions of the\nrich, which were on fire.\n\nOne man alone could have saved the Republic. People repented that\nthey had slighted him, and the peace party itself voted holocausts for\nHamilcar's return.\n\nThe sight of the zaimph had upset Salammbo. At night she thought\nthat she could hear the footsteps of the goddess, and she would awake\nterrified and shrieking. Every day she sent food to the temples. Taanach\nwas worn out with executing her orders, and Schahabarim never left her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nHAMILCAR BARCA\n\nThe Announcer of the Moons, who watched on the summit of the temple of\nEschmoun every night in order to signal the disturbances of the planet\nwith his trumpet, one morning perceived towards the west something like\na bird skimming the surface of the sea with its long wings.\n\nIt was a ship with three tiers of oars and with a horse carved on the\nprow. The sun was rising; the Announcer of the Moons put up his hand\nbefore his eyes, and then grasping his clarion with outstretched arms\nsounded a loud brazen cry over Carthage.\n\nPeople came out of every house; they would not believe what was said;\nthey disputed with one another; the mole was covered with people. At\nlast they recognised Hamilcar's trireme.\n\nIt advanced in fierce and haughty fashion, cleaving the foam around it,\nthe lateen-yard quite square and the sail bulging down the whole length\nof the mast; its gigantic oars kept time as they beat the water;\nevery now and then the extremity of the keel, which was shaped like a\nplough-share, would appear, and the ivory-headed horse, rearing both\nits feet beneath the spur which terminated the prow, would seem to be\nspeeding over the plains of the sea.\n\nAs it rounded the promontory the wind ceased, the sail fell, and a man\nwas seen standing bareheaded beside the pilot. It was he, Hamilcar, the\nSuffet! About his sides he wore gleaming sheets of steel; a red cloak,\nfastened to his shoulders, left his arms visible; two pearls of great\nlength hung from his ears, and his black, bushy beard rested on his\nbreast.\n\nThe galley, however, tossing amid the rocks, was proceeding along\nthe side of the mole, and the crowd followed it on the flag-stones,\nshouting:\n\n\"Greeting! blessing! Eye of Khamon! ah! deliver us! 'Tis the fault of\nthe rich! they want to put you to death! Take care of yourself, Barca!\"\n\nHe made no reply, as if the loud clamour of oceans and battles had\ncompletely deafened him. But when he was below the staircase leading\ndown from the Acropolis, Hamilcar raised his head, and looked with\nfolded arms upon the temple of Eschmoun. His gaze mounted higher still,\nto the great pure sky; he shouted an order in a harsh voice to his\nsailors; the trireme leaped forward; it grazed the idol set up at the\ncorner of the mole to stay the storms; and in the merchant harbour,\nwhich was full of filth, fragments of wood, and rinds of fruit, it\npushed aside and crushed against the other ships moored to stakes and\nterminating in crocodiles' jaws. The people hastened thither, and some\nthrew themselves into the water to swim to it. It was already at the\nvery end before the gate which bristled with nails. The gate rose, and\nthe trireme disappeared beneath the deep arch.\n\nThe Military Harbour was completely separated from the town; when\nambassadors arrived, they had to proceed between two walls through\na passage which had its outlet on the left in front of the temple of\nKhamon. This great expanse of water was as round as a cup, and was\nbordered with quays on which sheds were built for sheltering the ships.\nBefore each of these rose two pillars bearing the horns of Ammon on\ntheir capitals and forming continuous porticoes all round the basin. On\nan island in the centre stood a house for the marine Suffet.\n\nThe water was so limpid that the bottom was visible with its paving\nof white pebbles. The noise of the streets did not reach so far, and\nHamilcar as he passed recognised the triremes which he had formerly\ncommanded.\n\nNot more than twenty perhaps remained, under shelter on the land,\nleaning over on their sides or standing upright on their keels, with\nlofty poops and swelling prows, and covered with gildings and mystic\nsymbols. The chimaeras had lost their wings, the Pataec Gods their arms,\nthe bulls their silver horns;--and half-painted, motionless, and rotten\nas they were, yet full of associations, and still emitting the scent\nof voyages, they all seemed to say to him, like mutilated soldiers\non seeing their master again, \"'Tis we! 'tis we! and YOU too are\nvanquished!\"\n\nNo one excepting the marine Suffet might enter the admiral's house. So\nlong as there was no proof of his death he was considered as still in\nexistence. In this way the Ancients avoided a master the more, and they\nhad not failed to comply with the custom in respect to Hamilcar.\n\nThe Suffet proceeded into the deserted apartments. At every step he\nrecognised armour and furniture--familiar objects which nevertheless\nastonished him, and in a perfuming-pan in the vestibule there even\nremained the ashes of the perfumes that had been kindled at his\ndeparture for the conjuration of Melkarth. It was not thus that he had\nhoped to return. Everything that he had done, everything that he had\nseen, unfolded itself in his memory: assaults, conflagrations, legions,\ntempests, Drepanum, Syracuse, Lilybaeum, Mount Etna, the plateau of\nEryx, five years of battles,--until the fatal day when arms had been\nlaid down and Sicily had been lost. Then he once more saw the woods of\ncitron-trees, and herdsmen with their goats on grey mountains; and his\nheart leaped at the thought of the establishment of another Carthage\ndown yonder. His projects and his recollections buzzed through his\nhead, which was still dizzy from the pitching of the vessel; he was\noverwhelmed with anguish, and, becoming suddenly weak, he felt the\nnecessity of drawing near to the gods.\n\nThen he went up to the highest story of his house, and taking a\nnail-studded staple from a golden shell, which hung on his arm, he\nopened a small oval chamber.\n\nIt was softly lighted by means of delicate black discs let into the\nwall and as transparent as glass. Between the rows of these equal discs,\nholes, like those for the urns in columbaria, were hollowed out. Each of\nthem contained a round dark stone, which appeared to be very heavy.\nOnly people of superior understanding honoured these abaddirs, which had\nfallen from the moon. By their fall they denoted the stars, the sky, and\nfire; by their colour dark night, and by their density the cohesion of\nterrestrial things. A stifling atmosphere filled this mystic place. The\nround stones lying in the niches were whitened somewhat with sea-sand\nwhich the wind had no doubt driven through the door. Hamilcar counted\nthem one after another with the tip of his finger; then he hid his face\nin a saffron-coloured veil, and, falling on his knees, stretched himself\non the ground with both arms extended.\n\nThe daylight outside was beginning to strike on the folding shutters\nof black lattice-work. Arborescences, hillocks, eddies, and ill-defined\nanimals appeared in their diaphanous thickness; and the light came\nterrifying and yet peaceful as it must be behind the sun in the dull\nspaces of future creations. He strove to banish from his thoughts all\nforms, and all symbols and appellations of the gods, that he might the\nbetter apprehend the immutable spirit which outward appearances took\naway. Something of the planetary vitalities penetrated him, and he felt\nwithal a wiser and more intimate scorn of death and of every accident.\nWhen he rose he was filled with serene fearlessness and was proof\nagainst pity or dread, and as his chest was choking he went to the top\nof the tower which overlooked Carthage.\n\nThe town sank downwards in a long hollow curve, with its cupolas, its\ntemples, its golden roofs, its houses, its clusters of palm trees here\nand there, and its glass balls with streaming rays, while the ramparts\nformed, as it were, the gigantic border of this horn of plenty which\npoured itself out before him. Far below he could see the harbours, the\nsquares, the interiors of the courts, the plan of the streets, and the\npeople, who seemed very small and but little above the level of the\npavement. Ah! if Hanno had not arrived too late on the morning of\nthe Aegatian islands! He fastened his eyes on the extreme horizon and\nstretched forth his quivering arms in the direction of Rome.\n\nThe steps of the Acropolis were occupied by the multitude. In the square\nof Khamon the people were pressing forwards to see the Suffet come\nout, and the terraces were gradually being loaded with people; a few\nrecognised him, and he was saluted; but he retired in order the better\nto excite the impatience of the people.\n\nHamilcar found the most important men of his party below in the hall:\nIstatten, Subeldia, Hictamon, Yeoubas and others. They related to him\nall that had taken place since the conclusion of the peace: the greed\nof the Ancients, the departure of the soldiers, their return, their\ndemands, the capture of Gisco, the theft of the zaimph, the relief and\nsubsequent abandonment of Utica; but no one ventured to tell him of the\nevents which concerned himself. At last they separated, to meet again\nduring the night at the assembly of the Ancients in the temple of\nMoloch.\n\nThey had just gone out when a tumult arose outside the door. Some one\nwas trying to enter in spite of the servants; and as the disturbance was\nincreasing Hamilcar ordered the stranger to be shown in.\n\nAn old Negress made her appearance, broken, wrinkled, trembling,\nstupid-looking, wrapped to the heels in ample blue veils. She advanced\nface to face with the Suffet, and they looked at each other for some\ntime; suddenly Hamilcar started; at a wave of his hand the slaves\nwithdrew. Then, signing to her to walk with precaution, he drew her by\nthe arm into a remote apartment.\n\nThe Negress threw herself upon the floor to kiss his feet; he raised her\nbrutally.\n\n\"Where have you left him, Iddibal?\"\n\n\"Down there, Master;\" and extricating herself from her veils, she rubbed\nher face with her sleeve; the black colour, the senile trembling, the\nbent figure disappeared, and there remained a strong old man whose skin\nseemed tanned by sand, wind, and sea. A tuft of white hair rose on his\nskull like the crest of a bird; and he indicated his disguise, as it lay\non the ground, with an ironic glance.\n\n\"You have done well, Iddibal! 'Tis well!\" Then piercing him, as it were,\nwith his keen gaze: \"No one yet suspects?\"\n\nThe old man swore to him by the Kabiri that the mystery had been kept.\nThey never left their cottage, which was three days' journey from\nHadrumetum, on a shore peopled with turtles, and with palms on the dune.\n\"And in accordance with your command, O Master! I teach him to hurl the\njavelin and to drive a team.\"\n\n\"He is strong, is he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master, and intrepid as well! He has no fear of serpents, or\nthunder, or phantoms. He runs bare-footed like a herdsman along the\nbrinks of precipices.\"\n\n\"Speak! speak!\"\n\n\"He invents snares for wild beasts. Would you believe it, that last moon\nhe surprised an eagle; he dragged it away, and the bird's blood and the\nchild's were scattered in the air in large drops like driven roses.\nThe animal in its fury enwrapped him in the beating of its wings; he\nstrained it against his breast, and as it died his laughter increased,\npiercing and proud like the clashing of swords.\"\n\nHamilcar bent his head, dazzled by such presages of greatness.\n\n\"But he has been for some time restless and disturbed. He gazes at the\nsails passing far out at sea; he is melancholy, he rejects bread,\nhe inquires about the gods, and he wishes to become acquainted with\nCarthage.\"\n\n\"No, no! not yet!\" exclaimed the Suffet.\n\nThe old slave seemed to understand the peril which alarmed Hamilcar, and\nhe resumed:\n\n\"How is he to be restrained? Already I am obliged to make him promises,\nand I have come to Carthage only to buy him a dagger with a silver\nhandle and pearls all around it.\" Then he told how, having perceived the\nSuffet on the terrace, he had passed himself off on the warders of the\nharbour as one of Salammbo's women, so as to make his way in to him.\n\nHamilcar remained for a long time apparently lost in deliberation; at\nlast he said:\n\n\"To-morrow you will present yourself at sunset behind the purple\nfactories in Megara, and imitate a jackal's cry three times. If you do\nnot see me, you will return to Carthage on the first day of every moon.\nForget nothing! Love him! You may speak to him now about Hamilcar.\"\n\nThe slave resumed his costume, and they left the house and the harbour\ntogether.\n\nHamilcar went on his way alone on foot and without an escort, for the\nmeetings of the Ancients were, under extraordinary circumstances, always\nsecret, and were resorted to mysteriously.\n\nAt first he went along the western front of the Acropolis, and then\npassed through the Green Market, the galleries of Kinisdo, and the\nPerfumers' suburb. The scattered lights were being extinguished, the\nbroader streets grew still, then shadows glided through the darkness.\nThey followed him, others appeared, and like him they all directed their\ncourse towards the Mappalian district.\n\nThe temple of Moloch was built at the foot of a steep defile in a\nsinister spot. From below nothing could be seen but lofty walls rising\nindefinitely like those of a monstrous tomb. The night was gloomy, a\ngreyish fog seemed to weigh upon the sea, which beat against the cliff\nwith a noise as of death-rattles and sobs; and the shadows gradually\nvanished as if they had passed through the walls.\n\nBut as soon as the doorway was crossed one found oneself in a vast\nquadrangular court bordered by arcades. In the centre rose a mass of\narchitecture with eight equal faces. It was surmounted by cupolas which\nthronged around a second story supporting a kind of rotunda, from which\nsprang a cone with a re-entrant curve and terminating in a ball on the\nsummit.\n\nFires were burning in cylinders of filigree-work fitted upon poles,\nwhich men were carrying to and fro. These lights flickered in the gusts\nof wind and reddened the golden combs which fastened their plaited\nhair on the nape of the neck. They ran about calling to one another to\nreceive the Ancients.\n\nHere and there on the flag-stones huge lions were couched like\nsphinxes, living symbols of the devouring sun. They were slumbering with\nhalf-closed eyelids. But roused by the footsteps and voices they rose\nslowly, came towards the Ancients, whom they recognised by their dress,\nand rubbed themselves against their thighs, arching their backs with\nsonorous yawns; the vapour of their breath passed across the light of\nthe torches. The stir increased, doors closed, all the priests fled,\nand the Ancients disappeared beneath the columns which formed a deep\nvestibule round the temple.\n\nThese columns were arranged in such a way that their circular ranks,\nwhich were contained one within another, showed the Saturnian period\nwith its years, the years with their months, and the months with their\ndays, and finally reached to the walls of the sanctuary.\n\nHere it was that the Ancients laid aside their sticks of\nnarwhal's-horn,--for a law which was always observed inflicted the\npunishment of death upon any one entering the meeting with any kind\nof weapon. Several wore a rent repaired with a strip of purple at the\nbottom of their garment, to show that they had not been economical in\ntheir dress when mourning for their relatives, and this testimony to\ntheir affliction prevented the slit from growing larger. Others had\ntheir beards inclosed in little bags of violet skin, and fastened to\ntheir ears by two cords. They all accosted one another by embracing\nbreast to breast. They surrounded Hamilcar with congratulations; they\nmight have been taken for brothers meeting their brother again.\n\nThese men were generally thick-set, with curved noses like those of the\nAssyrian colossi. In a few, however, the more prominent cheek-bone, the\ntaller figure, and the narrower foot, betrayed an African origin\nand nomad ancestors. Those who lived continually shut up in their\ncounting-houses had pale faces; others showed in theirs the severity\nof the desert, and strange jewels sparkled on all the fingers of\ntheir hands, which were burnt by unknown suns. The navigators might be\ndistinguished by their rolling gait, while the men of agriculture\nsmelt of the wine-press, dried herbs, and the sweat of mules. These\nold pirates had lands under tillage, these money-grubbers would fit\nout ships, these proprietors of cultivated lands supported slaves who\nfollowed trades. All were skilled in religious discipline, expert in\nstrategy, pitiless and rich. They looked wearied of prolonged cares.\nTheir flaming eyes expressed distrust, and their habits of travelling\nand lying, trafficking and commanding, gave an appearance of cunning\nand violence, a sort of discreet and convulsive brutality to their whole\ndemeanour. Further, the influence of the god cast a gloom upon them.\n\nThey first passed through a vaulted hall which was shaped like an egg.\nSeven doors, corresponding to the seven planets, displayed seven squares\nof different colours against the wall. After traversing a long room they\nentered another similar hall.\n\nA candelabrum completely covered with chiselled flowers was burning at\nthe far end, and each of its eight golden branches bore a wick of byssus\nin a diamond chalice. It was placed upon the last of the long steps\nleading to a great altar, the corners of which terminated in horns of\nbrass. Two lateral staircases led to its flattened summit; the stones\nof it could not be seen; it was like a mountain of heaped cinders, and\nsomething indistinct was slowly smoking at the top of it. Then further\nback, higher than the candelabrum, and much higher than the altar, rose\nthe Moloch, all of iron, and with gaping apertures in his human breast.\nHis outspread wings were stretched upon the wall, his tapering hands\nreached down to the ground; three black stones bordered by yellow\ncircles represented three eyeballs on his brow, and his bull's head was\nraised with a terrible effort as if in order to bellow.\n\nEbony stools were ranged round the apartment. Behind each of them was\na bronze shaft resting on three claws and supporting a torch. All these\nlights were reflected in the mother-of-pearl lozenges which formed the\npavement of the hall. So lofty was the latter that the red colour of the\nwalls grew black as it rose towards the vaulted roof, and the three eyes\nof the idol appeared far above like stars half lost in the night.\n\nThe Ancients sat down on the ebony stools after putting the trains of\ntheir robes over their heads. They remained motionless with their hands\ncrossed inside their broad sleeves, and the mother-of-pearl pavement\nseemed like a luminous river streaming from the altar to the door and\nflowing beneath their naked feet.\n\nThe four pontiffs had their places in the centre, sitting back to back\non four ivory seats which formed a cross, the high-priest of Eschmoun\nin a hyacinth robe, the high-priest of Tanith in a white linen robe, the\nhigh-priest of Khamon in a tawny woollen robe, and the high-priest of\nMoloch in a purple robe.\n\nHamilcar advanced towards the candelabrum. He walked all round it,\nlooking at the burning wicks; then he threw a scented powder upon them,\nand violet flames appeared at the extremities of the branches.\n\nThen a shrill voice rose; another replied to it, and the hundred\nAncients, the four pontiffs, and Hamilcar, who remained standing,\nsimultaneously intoned a hymn, and their voices--ever repeating the\nsame syllables and strengthening the sounds--rose, grew loud, became\nterrible, and then suddenly were still.\n\nThere was a pause for some time. At last Hamilcar drew from his breast a\nlittle three-headed statuette, as blue as sapphire, and placed it before\nhim. It was the image of Truth, the very genius of his speech. Then he\nreplaced it in his bosom, and all, as if seized with sudden wrath, cried\nout:\n\n\"They are good friends of yours, are the Barbarians! Infamous traitor!\nYou come back to see us perish, do you not? Let him speak!--No! no!\"\n\nThey were taking their revenge for the constraint to which political\nceremonial had just obliged them; and even though they had wished for\nHamilcar's return, they were now indignant that he had not anticipated\ntheir disasters, or rather that he had not endured them as well as they.\n\nWhen the tumult had subsided, the pontiff of Moloch rose:\n\n\"We ask you why you did not return to Carthage?\"\n\n\"What is that to you?\" replied the Suffet disdainfully.\n\nTheir shouts were redoubled.\n\n\"Of what do you accuse me? I managed the war badly, perhaps! You have\nseen how I order my battles, you who conveniently allow Barbarians--\"\n\n\"Enough! enough!\"\n\nHe went on in a low voice so as to make himself the better listened to:\n\n\"Oh! that is true! I am wrong, lights of the Baals; there are intrepid\nmen among you! Gisco, rise!\" And surveying the step of the altar with\nhalf-closed eyelids, as if he sought for some one, he repeated:\n\n\"Rise, Gisco! You can accuse me; they will protect you! But where is\nhe?\" Then, as if he remembered himself: \"Ah! in his house, no doubt!\nsurrounded by his sons, commanding his slaves, happy, and counting on\nthe wall the necklaces of honour which his country has given to him!\"\n\nThey moved about raising their shoulders as if they were being scourged\nwith thongs. \"You do not even know whether he is living or dead!\" And\nwithout giving any heed to their clamours he said that in deserting the\nSuffet they had deserted the Republic. So, too, the peace with Rome,\nhowever advantageous it might appear to them, was more fatal than twenty\nbattles. A few--those who were the least rich of the Council and\nwere suspected of perpetual leanings towards the people or towards\ntyranny--applauded. Their opponents, chiefs of the Syssitia and\nadministrators, triumphed over them in point of numbers; and the more\neminent of them had ranged themselves close to Hanno, who was sitting at\nthe other end of the hall before the lofty door, which was closed by a\nhanging of hyacinth colour.\n\nHe had covered the ulcers on his face with paint. But the gold dust in\nhis hair had fallen upon his shoulders, where it formed two brilliant\nsheets, so that his hair appeared whitish, fine, and frizzled like wool.\nHis hands were enveloped in linen soaked in a greasy perfume, which\ndripped upon the pavement, and his disease had no doubt considerably\nincreased, for his eyes were hidden beneath the folds of his eyelids.\nHe had thrown back his head in order to see. His partisans urged him to\nspeak. At last in a hoarse and hideous voice he said:\n\n\"Less arrogance, Barca! We have all been vanquished! Each one supports\nhis own misfortune! Be resigned!\"\n\n\"Tell us rather,\" said Hamilcar, smiling, \"how it was that you steered\nyour galleys into the Roman fleet?\"\n\n\"I was driven by the wind,\" replied Hanno.\n\n\"You are like a rhinoceros trampling on his dung: you are displaying\nyour own folly! be silent!\" And they began to indulge in recriminations\nrespecting the battle of the Aegatian islands.\n\nHanno accused him of not having come to meet him.\n\n\"But that would have left Eryx undefended. You ought to have stood out\nfrom the coast; what prevented you? Ah! I forgot! all elephants are\nafraid of the sea!\"\n\nHamilcar's followers thought this jest so good that they burst out into\nloud laughter. The vault rang with it like the beating of tympanums.\n\nHanno denounced the unworthiness of such an insult; the disease had\ncome upon him from a cold taken at the siege of Hecatompylos, and tears\nflowed down his face like winter rain on a ruined wall.\n\nHamilcar resumed:\n\n\"If you had loved me as much as him there would be great joy in Carthage\nnow! How many times did I not call upon you! and you always refused me\nmoney!\"\n\n\"We had need of it,\" said the chiefs of the Syssitia.\n\n\"And when things were desperate with me--we drank mules' urine and ate\nthe straps of our sandals; when I would fain have had the blades of\ngrass soldiers and made battalions with the rottenness of our dead, you\nrecalled the vessels that I had left!\"\n\n\"We could not risk everything,\" replied Baat-Baal, who possessed gold\nmines in Darytian Gaetulia.\n\n\"But what did you do here, at Carthage, in your houses, behind your\nwalls? There are Gauls on the Eridanus, who ought to have been roused,\nChanaanites at Cyrene who would have come, and while the Romans send\nambassadors to Ptolemaeus--\"\n\n\"Now he is extolling the Romans to us!\" Some one shouted out to him:\n\"How much have they paid you to defend them?\"\n\n\"Ask that of the plains of Brutium, of the ruins of Locri, of\nMetapontum, and of Heraclea! I have burnt all their trees, I\nhave pillaged all their temples, and even to the death of their\ngrandchildren's grandchildren--\"\n\n\"Why, you disclaim like a rhetor!\" said Kapouras, a very illustrious\nmerchant. \"What is it that you want?\"\n\n\"I say that we must be more ingenious or more terrible! If the whole of\nAfrica rejects your yoke the reason is, my feeble masters, that you do\nnot know how to fasten it to her shoulders! Agathocles, Regulus, Coepio,\nany bold man has only to land and capture her; and when the Libyans in\nthe east concert with the Numidians in the west, and the Nomads\ncome from the south, and the Romans from the north\"--a cry of horror\nrose--\"Oh! you will beat your breasts, and roll in the dust, and tear\nyour cloaks! No matter! you will have to go and turn the mill-stone in\nthe Suburra, and gather grapes on the hills of Latium.\"\n\nThey smote their right thighs to mark their sense of the scandal, and\nthe sleeves of their robes rose like large wings of startled birds.\nHamilcar, carried away by a spirit, continued his speech, standing on\nthe highest step of the altar, quivering and terrible; he raised his\narms, and the rays from the candelabrum which burned behind him passed\nbetween his fingers like javelins of gold.\n\n\"You will lose your ships, your country seats, your chariots, your\nhanging beds, and the slaves who rub your feet! The jackal will crouch\nin your palaces, and the ploughshare will upturn your tombs. Nothing\nwill be left but the eagles' scream and a heap of ruins. Carthage, thou\nwilt fall!\"\n\nThe four pontiffs spread out their hands to avert the anathema. All had\nrisen. But the marine Suffet, being a sacerdotal magistrate under the\nprotection of the Sun, was inviolate so long as the assembly of the\nrich had not judged him. Terror was associated with the altar. They drew\nback.\n\nHamilcar had ceased speaking, and was panting with eye fixed, his face\nas pale as the pearls of his tiara, almost frightened at himself, and\nhis spirit lost in funereal visions. From the height on which he stood,\nall the torches on the bronze shafts seemed to him like a vast crown of\nfire laid level with the pavement; black smoke issuing from them mounted\nup into the darkness of the vault; and for some minutes the silence was\nso profound that they could hear in the distance the sound of the sea.\n\nThen the Ancients began to question one another. Their interests, their\nexistence, were attacked by the Barbarians. But it was impossible to\nconquer them without the assistance of the Suffet, and in spite of their\npride this consideration made them forget every other. His friends were\ntaken aside. There were interested reconciliations, understandings, and\npromises. Hamilcar would not take any further part in any government.\nAll conjured him. They besought him; and as the word treason occurred\nin their speech, he fell into a passion. The sole traitor was the Great\nCouncil, for as the enlistment of the soldiers expired with the war,\nthey became free as soon as the war was finished; he even exalted their\nbravery and all the advantages which might be derived from interesting\nthem in the Republic by donations and privileges.\n\nThen Magdassin, a former provincial governor, said, as he rolled his\nyellow eyes:\n\n\"Truly Barca, with your travelling you have become a Greek, or a Latin,\nor something! Why speak you of rewards for these men? Rather let ten\nthousand Barbarians perish than a single one of us!\"\n\nThe Ancients nodded approval, murmuring:--\"Yes, is there need for so\nmuch trouble? They can always be had?\"\n\n\"And they can be got rid of conveniently, can they not? They are\ndeserted as they were by you in Sardinia. The enemy is apprised of the\nroad which they are to take, as in the case of those Gauls in Sicily,\nor perhaps they are disembarked in the middle of the sea. As I was\nreturning I saw the rock quite white with their bones!\"\n\n\"What a misfortune!\" said Kapouras impudently.\n\n\"Have they not gone over to the enemy a hundred times?\" cried the\nothers.\n\n\"Why, then,\" exclaimed Hamilcar, \"did you recall them to Carthage,\nnotwithstanding your laws? And when they are in your town, poor and\nnumerous amid all your riches, it does not occur to you to weaken them\nby the slightest division! Afterwards you dismiss the whole of them\nwith their women and children, without keeping a single hostage! Did\nyou expect that they would murder themselves to spare you the pain of\nkeeping your oaths? You hate them because they are strong! You hate me\nstill more, who am their master! Oh! I felt it just now when you were\nkissing my hands and were all putting a constraint upon yourselves not\nto bite them!\"\n\nIf the lions that were sleeping in the court had come howling in, the\nuproar could not have been more frightful. But the pontiff of Eschmoun\nrose, and, standing perfectly upright, with his knees close together,\nhis elbows pressed to his body, and his hands half open, he said:\n\n\"Barca, Carthage has need that you should take the general command of\nthe Punic forces against the Mercenaries!\"\n\n\"I refuse,\" replied Hamilcar.\n\n\"We will give you full authority,\" cried the chiefs of the Syssitia.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"With no control, no partition, all the money that you want, all\nthe captives, all the booty, fifty zereths of land for every enemy's\ncorpse.\"\n\n\"No! no! because it is impossible to conquer with you!\"\n\n\"He is afraid!\"\n\n\"Because you are cowardly, greedy, ungrateful, pusillanimous and mad!\"\n\n\"He is careful of them!\"\n\n\"In order to put himself at their head,\" said some one.\n\n\"And return against us,\" said another; and from the bottom of the hall\nHanno howled:\n\n\"He wants to make himself king!\"\n\nThen they bounded up, overturning the seats and the torches: the crowd\nof them rushed towards the altar; they brandished daggers. But Hamilcar\ndived into his sleeves and drew from them two broad cutlasses; and\nhalf stooping, his left foot advanced, his eyes flaming and his\nteeth clenched, he defied them as he stood there beneath the golden\ncandelabrum.\n\nThus they had brought weapons with them as a precaution; it was a crime;\nthey looked with terror at one another. As all were guilty, every one\nbecame quickly reassured; and by degrees they turned their backs on the\nSuffet and came down again maddened with humiliation. For the second\ntime they recoiled before him. They remained standing for some time.\nSeveral who had wounded their fingers put them to their mouths or rolled\nthem gently in the hem of their mantles, and they were about to depart\nwhen Hamilcar heard these words:\n\n\"Why! it is a piece of delicacy to avoid distressing his daughter!\"\n\nA louder voice was raised:\n\n\"No doubt, since she takes her lovers from among the Mercenaries!\"\n\nAt first he tottered, then his eye rapidly sought for Schahabarim. But\nthe priest of Tanith had alone remained in his place; and Hamilcar could\nsee only his lofty cap in the distance. All were sneering in his face.\nIn proportion as his anguish increased their joy redoubled, and those\nwho were behind shouted amid the hootings:\n\n\"He was seen coming out of her room!\"\n\n\"One morning in the month of Tammouz!\"\n\n\"It was the thief who stole the zaimph!\"\n\n\"A very handsome man!\"\n\n\"Taller than you!\"\n\nHe snatched off the tiara, the ensign of his rank--his tiara with its\neight mystic rows, and with an emerald shell in the centre--and with\nboth hands and with all his strength dashed it to the ground; the golden\ncircles rebounded as they broke, and the pearls rang upon the pavement.\nThen they saw a long scar upon the whiteness of his brow; it moved like\na serpent between his eyebrows; all his limbs trembled. He ascended one\nof the lateral staircases which led on to the altar, and walked upon\nthe latter! This was to devote himself to the god, to offer himself as\na holocaust. The motion of his mantle agitated the lights of the\ncandelabrum, which was lower than his sandals, and the fine dust raised\nby his footsteps surrounded him like a cloud as high as the waist. He\nstopped between the legs of the brass colossus. He took up two handfuls\nof the dust, the mere sight of which made every Carthaginian shudder\nwith horror, and said:\n\n\"By the hundred torches of your Intelligences! by the eight fires of the\nKabiri! by the stars, the meteors, and the volcanoes! by everything that\nburns! by the thirst of the desert and the saltness of the ocean! by\nthe cave of Hadrumetum and the empire of Souls! by extermination! by the\nashes of your sons and the ashes of the brothers of your ancestors with\nwhich I now mingle my own!--you, the Hundred of the Council of Carthage,\nhave lied in your accusation of my daughter! And I, Hamilcar Barca,\nmarine Suffet, chief of the rich and ruler of the people, in the\npresence of bull-headed Moloch, I swear\"--they expected something\nfrightful, but he resumed in a loftier and calmer tone--\"that I will not\neven speak to her about it!\"\n\nThe sacred servants entered wearing their golden combs, some with purple\nsponges and others with branches of palm. They raised the hyacinth\ncurtain which was stretched before the door; and through the opening of\nthis angle there was visible behind the other halls the great pink\nsky which seemed to be a continuation of the vault and to rest at\nthe horizon upon the blue sea. The sun was issuing from the waves and\nmounting upwards. It suddenly struck upon the breast of the brazen\ncolossus, which was divided into seven compartments closed by gratings.\nHis red-toothed jaws opened in a horrible yawn; his enormous nostrils\nwere dilated, the broad daylight animated him, and gave him a terrible\nand impatient aspect, as if he would fain have leaped without to mingle\nwith the star, the god, and together traverse the immensities.\n\nThe torches, however, which were scattered on the ground, were still\nburning, while here and there on the mother-of-pearl pavement was\nstretched from them what looked like spots of blood. The Ancients were\nreeling from exhaustion; they filled their lungs inhaling the freshness\nof the air; the sweat flowed down their livid faces; they had shouted\nso much that they could now scarcely make their voices heard. But their\nwrath against the Suffet was not at all abated; they hurled menaces at\nhim by way of farewells, and Hamilcar answered them again.\n\n\"Until the next night, Barca, in the temple of Eschmoun!\"\n\n\"I shall be there!\"\n\n\"We will have you condemned by the rich!\"\n\n\"And I you by the people!\"\n\n\"Take care that you do not end on the cross!\"\n\n\"And you that you are not torn to pieces in the streets!\"\n\nAs soon as they were on the threshold of the court they again assumed a\ncalm demeanour.\n\nTheir runners and coachmen were waiting for them at the door. Most of\nthem departed on white mules. The Suffet leaped into his chariot and\ntook the reins; the two animals, curving their necks, and rhythmically\nbeating the resounding pebbles, went up the whole of the Mappalian Way\nat full gallop, and the silver vulture at the extremity of the pole\nseemed to fly, so quickly did the chariot pass along.\n\nThe road crossed a field planted with slabs of stone, which were painted\non the top like pyramids, and had open hands carved out in the centre as\nif all the dead men lying beneath had stretched them out towards heaven\nto demand something. Next there came scattered cabins built of earth,\nbranches, and bulrush-hurdles, and all of a conical shape. These\ndwellings, which became constantly denser as the road ascended towards\nthe Suffet's gardens, were irregularly separated from one another by\nlittle pebble walls, trenches of spring water, ropes of esparto-grass,\nand nopal hedges. But Hamilcar's eyes were fastened on a great tower,\nthe three storys of which formed three monster cylinders--the first\nbeing built of stone, the second of brick, and the third all of\ncedar--supporting a copper cupola upon twenty-four pillars of juniper,\nfrom which slender interlacing chains of brass hung down after the\nmanner of garlands. This lofty edifice overlooked the buildings--the\nemporiums and mercantile houses--which stretched to the right, while the\nwomen's palace rose at the end of the cypress trees, which were ranged\nin line like two walls of bronze.\n\nWhen the echoing chariot had entered through the narrow gateway it\nstopped beneath a broad shed in which there were shackled horses eating\nfrom heaps of chopped grass.\n\nAll the servants hastened up. They formed quite a multitude, those who\nworked on the country estates having been brought to Carthage through\nfear of the soldiers. The labourers, who were clad in animals' skins,\nhad chains riveted to their ankles and trailing after them; the workers\nin the purple factories had arms as red as those of executioners; the\nsailors wore green caps; the fishermen coral necklaces; the huntsmen\ncarried nets on their shoulders; and the people belonging to Megara\nwore black or white tunics, leathern drawers, and caps of straw, felt or\nlinen, according to their service or their different occupations.\n\nBehind pressed a tattered populace. They lived without employment remote\nfrom the apartments, slept at night in the gardens, ate the refuse\nfrom the kitchens,--a human mouldiness vegetating in the shadow of\nthe palace. Hamilcar tolerated them from foresight even more than from\nscorn. They had all put a flower in the ear in token of their joy, and\nmany of them had never seen him.\n\nBut men with head-dresses like the Sphinx's, and furnished with great\nsticks, dashed into the crowd, striking right and left. This was to\ndrive back the slaves, who were curious to see their master, so that he\nmight not be assailed by their numbers or inconvenienced by their smell.\n\nThen they all threw themselves flat on the ground, crying:\n\n\"Eye of Baal, may your house flourish!\" And through these people as they\nlay thus on the ground in the avenue of cypress trees, Abdalonim, the\nSteward of the stewards, waving a white miter, advanced towards Hamilcar\nwith a censer in his hand.\n\nSalammbo was then coming down the galley staircases. All her slave women\nfollowed her; and, at each of her steps, they also descended. The heads\nof the Negresses formed big black spots on the line of the bands of\nthe golden plates clasping the foreheads of the Roman women. Others had\nsilver arrows, emerald butterflies, or long bodkins set like suns in\ntheir hair. Rings, clasps, necklaces, fringes, and bracelets shone amid\nthe confusion of white, yellow, and blue garments; a rustling of\nlight material became audible; the pattering of sandals might be heard\ntogether with the dull sound of naked feet as they were set down on the\nwood;--and here and there a tall eunuch, head and shoulders above them,\nsmiled with his face in air. When the shouting of the men had subsided\nthey hid their faces in their sleeves, and together uttered a strange\ncry like the howling of a she-wolf, and so frenzied and strident was\nit that it seemed to make the great ebony staircase, with its thronging\nwomen, vibrate from top to bottom like a lyre.\n\nThe wind lifted their veils, and the slender stems of the papyrus plant\nrocked gently. It was the month of Schebaz and the depth of winter. The\nflowering pomegranates swelled against the azure of the sky, and the\nsea disappeared through the branches with an island in the distance half\nlost in the mist.\n\nHamilcar stopped on perceiving Salammbo. She had come to him after the\ndeath of several male children. Moreover, the birth of daughters\nwas considered a calamity in the religions of the Sun. The gods had\nafterwards sent him a son; but he still felt something of the betrayal\nof his hope, and the shock, as it were, of the curse which he had\nuttered against her. Salammbo, however, continued to advance.\n\nLong bunches of various-coloured pearls fell from her ears to her\nshoulders, and as far as her elbows. Her hair was crisped so as to\nsimulate a cloud. Round her neck she wore little quadrangular plates of\ngold, representing a woman between two rampant lions; and her costume\nwas a complete reproduction of the equipment of the goddess. Her\nbroad-sleeved hyacinth robe fitted close to her figure, widening out\nbelow. The vermilion on her lips gave additional whiteness to her teeth,\nand the antimony on her eyelids greater length to her eyes. Her sandals,\nwhich were cut out in bird's plumage, had very high heels, and she was\nextraordinarily pale, doubtless on account of the cold.\n\nAt last she came close to Hamilcar, and without looking at him, without\nraising her head to him:\n\n\"Greeting, eye of Baalim, eternal glory! triumph! leisure! satisfaction!\nriches! Long has my heart been sad and the house drooping. But the\nreturning master is like reviving Tammouz; and beneath your gaze, O\nfather, joyfulness and a new existence will everywhere prevail!\"\n\nAnd taking from Taanach's hands a little oblong vase wherein smoked a\nmixture of meal, butter, cardamom, and wine: \"Drink freely,\" said she,\n\"of the returning cup, which your servant has prepared!\"\n\nHe replied: \"A blessing upon you!\" and he mechanically grasped the\ngolden vase which she held out to him.\n\nHe scanned her, however, with such harsh attention, that Salammbo was\ntroubled and stammered out:\n\n\"They have told you, O Master!\"\n\n\"Yes! I know!\" said Hamilcar in a low voice.\n\nWas this a confession, or was she speaking of the Barbarians? And he\nadded a few vague words upon the public embarrassments which he hoped by\nhis sole efforts to clear away.\n\n\"O father!\" exclaimed Salammbo, \"you will not obliterate what is\nirreparable!\"\n\nThen he drew back and Salammbo was astonished at his amazement; for she\nwas not thinking of Carthage but of the sacrilege in which she found\nherself implicated. This man, who made legions tremble and whom she\nhardly knew, terrified her like a god; he had guessed, he knew all,\nsomething awful was about to happen. \"Pardon!\" she cried.\n\nHamilcar slowly bowed his head.\n\nAlthough she wished to accuse herself she dared not open her lips; and\nyet she felt stifled with the need of complaining and being comforted.\nHamilcar was struggling against a longing to break his oath. He kept it\nout of pride or from the dread of putting an end to his uncertainty; and\nhe looked into her face with all his might so as to lay hold on what she\nkept concealed at the bottom of her heart.\n\nBy degrees the panting Salammbo, crushed by such heavy looks, let her\nhead sink below her shoulders. He was now sure that she had erred in\nthe embrace of a Barbarian; he shuddered and raised both his fists. She\nuttered a shriek and fell down among her women, who crowded around her.\n\nHamilcar turned on his heel. All the stewards followed him.\n\nThe door of the emporiums was opened, and he entered a vast round hall\nform which long passages leading to other halls branched off like the\nspokes from the nave of a wheel. A stone disc stood in the centre with\nbalustrades to support the cushions that were heaped up upon carpets.\n\nThe Suffet walked at first with rapid strides; he breathed noisily, he\nstruck the ground with his heel, and drew his hand across his forehead\nlike a man annoyed by flies. But he shook his head, and as he perceived\nthe accumulation of his riches he became calm; his thoughts, which were\nattracted by the vistas in the passages, wandered to the other halls\nthat were full of still rarer treasures. Bronze plates, silver ingots,\nand iron bars alternated with pigs of tin brought from the Cassiterides\nover the Dark Sea; gums from the country of the Blacks were running over\ntheir bags of palm bark; and gold dust heaped up in leathern bottles was\ninsensibly creeping out through the worn-out seams. Delicate filaments\ndrawn from marine plants hung amid flax from Egypt, Greece, Taprobane\nand Judaea; mandrepores bristled like large bushes at the foot of the\nwalls; and an indefinable odour--the exhalation from perfumes, leather,\nspices, and ostrich feathers, the latter tied in great bunches at the\nvery top of the vault--floated through the air. An arch was formed above\nthe door before each passage with elephants' teeth placed upright and\nmeeting together at the points.\n\nAt last he ascended the stone disc. All the stewards stood with arms\nfolded and heads bent while Abdalonim reared his pointed mitre with a\nhaughty air.\n\nHamilcar questioned the Chief of the Ships. He was an old pilot with\neyelids chafed by the wind, and white locks fell to his hips as if\ndashing foam of the tempests had remained on his beard.\n\nHe replied that he had sent a fleet by Gades and Thymiamata to try to\nreach Eziongaber by doubling the Southern Horn and the promontory of\nAromata.\n\nOthers had advanced continuously towards the west for four moons without\nmeeting with any shore; but the ships prows became entangled in\nweeds, the horizon echoed continually with the noise of cataracts,\nblood-coloured mists darkened the sun, a perfume-laden breeze lulled the\ncrews to sleep; and their memories were so disturbed that they were now\nunable to tell anything. However, expeditions had ascended the rivers of\nthe Scythians, had made their way into Colchis, and into the countries\nof the Jugrians and of the Estians, had carried off fifteen hundred\nmaidens in the Archipelago, and sunk all the strange vessels sailing\nbeyond Cape Oestrymon, so that the secret of the routes should not\nbe known. King Ptolemaeus was detaining the incense from Schesbar;\nSyracuse, Elathia, Corsica, and the islands had furnished nothing, and\nthe old pilot lowered his voice to announce that a trireme was taken at\nRusicada by the Numidians,--\"for they are with them, Master.\"\n\nHamilcar knit his brows; then he signed to the Chief of the Journeys to\nspeak. This functionary was enveloped in a brown, ungirdled robe, and\nhad his head covered with a long scarf of white stuff which passed along\nthe edge of his lips and fell upon his shoulder behind.\n\nThe caravans had set out regularly at the winter equinox. But of fifteen\nhundred men directing their course towards the extreme boundaries of\nEthiopia with excellent camels, new leathern bottles, and supplies of\npainted cloth, but one had reappeared at Carthage--the rest having died\nof fatigue or become mad through the terror of the desert;--and he said\nthat far beyond the Black Harousch, after passing the Atarantes and the\ncountry of the great apes, he had seen immense kingdoms, wherein the\npettiest utensils were all of gold, a river of the colour of milk and\nas broad as the sea, forests of blue trees, hills of aromatics, monsters\nwith human faces vegetating on the rocks with eyeballs which expanded\nlike flowers to look at you; and then crystal mountains supporting the\nsun behind lakes all covered with dragons. Others had returned from\nIndia with peacocks, pepper, and new textures. As to those who go by way\nof the Syrtes and the temple of Ammon to purchase chalcedony, they had\nno doubt perished in the sands. The caravans from Gaetulia and Phazzana\nhad furnished their usual supplies; but he, the Chief of the Journeys,\ndid not venture to fit one out just now.\n\nHamilcar understood; the Mercenaries were in occupation of the country.\nHe leaned upon his other elbow with a hollow groan; and the Chief of\nFarms was so afraid to speak that he trembled horribly in spite of\nhis thick shoulders and his big red eyeballs. His face, which was as\nsnub-nosed as a mastiff's, was surmounted by a net woven of threads of\nbark. He wore a waist-belt of hairy leopard's skin, wherein gleamed two\nformidable cutlasses.\n\nAs soon as Hamilcar turned away he began to cry aloud and invoke all the\nBaals. It was not his fault! he could not help it! He had watched the\ntemperature, the soil, the stars, had planted at the winter solstice and\npruned at the waning of the moon, had inspected the slaves and had been\ncareful of their clothes.\n\nBut Hamilcar grew angry at this loquacity. He clacked his tongue, and\nthe man with the cutlasses went on in rapid tones:\n\n\"Ah, Master! they have pillaged everything! sacked everything! destroyed\neverything! Three thousand trees have been cut down at Maschala, and\nat Ubada the granaries have been looted and the cisterns filled up! At\nTedes they have carried off fifteen hundred gomors of meal; at Marrazana\nthey have killed the shepherds, eaten the flocks, burnt your house--your\nbeautiful house with its cedar beams, which you used to visit in the\nsummer! The slaves at Tuburbo who were reaping barley fled to the\nmountains; and the asses, the mules both great and small, the oxen from\nTaormina, and the antelopes,--not a single one left! all carried away!\nIt is a curse! I shall not survive it!\" He went on again in tears: \"Ah!\nif you knew how full the cellars were, and how the ploughshares shone!\nAh! the fine rams! ah! the fine bulls!--\"\n\nHamilcar's wrath was choking him. It burst forth:\n\n\"Be silent! Am I a pauper then? No lies! speak the truth! I wish to know\nall that I have lost to the last shekel, to the last cab! Abdalonim,\nbring me the accounts of the ships, of the caravans, of the farms, of\nthe house! And if your consciences are not clear, woe be on your heads!\nGo out!\"\n\nAll the stewards went out walking backwards, with their fists touching\nthe ground.\n\nAbdalonim went up to a set of pigeon-holes in the wall, and from the\nmidst of them took out knotted cords, strips of linen or papyrus, and\nsheeps' shoulder-blades inscribed with delicate writing. He laid them\nat Hamilcar's feet, placed in his hands a wooden frame furnished on the\ninside with three threads on which balls of gold, silver, and horn were\nstrung, and began:\n\n\"One hundred and ninety-two houses in the Mappalian district let to the\nNew Carthaginians at the rate of one bekah a moon.\"\n\n\"No! it is too much! be lenient towards the poor people! and you will\ntry to learn whether they are attached to the Republic, and write down\nthe names of those who appear to you to be the most daring! What next?\"\n\nAbdalonim hesitated in surprise at such generosity.\n\nHamilcar snatched the strips of linen from his hands.\n\n\"What is this? three palaces around Khamon at twelve kesitahs a month!\nMake it twenty! I do not want to be eaten up by the rich.\"\n\nThe Steward of the stewards, after a long salutation, resumed:\n\n\"Lent to Tigillas until the end of the season two kikars at three per\ncent., maritime interest; to Bar-Malkarth fifteen hundred shekels on the\nsecurity of thirty slaves. But twelve have died in the salt-marshes.\"\n\n\"That is because they were not hardy,\" said the Suffet, laughing. \"No\nmatter! if he is in want of money, satisfy him! We should always lend,\nand at different rates of interest, according to the wealth of the\nindividual.\"\n\nThen the servant hastened to read all that had been brought in by the\niron-mines of Annaba, the coral fisheries, the purple factories, the\nfarming of the tax on the resident Greeks, the export of silver to\nArabia, where it had ten times the value of gold, and the captures of\nvessels, deduction of a tenth being made for the temple of the goddess.\n\"Each time I declared a quarter less, Master!\" Hamilcar was reckoning\nwith the balls; they rang beneath his fingers.\n\n\"Enough! What have you paid?\"\n\n\"To Stratonicles of Corinth, and to three Alexandrian merchants, on\nthese letters here (they have been realised), ten thousand Athenian\ndrachmas, and twelve Syrian talents of gold. The food for the crews,\namounting to twenty minae a month for each trireme--\"\n\n\"I know! How many lost?\"\n\n\"Here is the account on these sheets of lead,\" said the Steward. \"As to\nthe ships chartered in common, it has often been necessary to throw the\ncargo into the seas, and so the unequal losses have been divided among\nthe partners. For the ropes which were borrowed from the arsenals, and\nwhich it was impossible to restore, the Syssitia exacted eight hundred\nkesitahs before the expedition to Utica.\"\n\n\"They again!\" said Hamilcar, hanging his head; and he remained for a\ntime as if quite crushed by the weight of all the hatreds that he could\nfeel upon him. \"But I do not see the Megara expenses?\"\n\nAbdalonim, turning pale, went to another set of pigeon-holes, and\ntook from them some planchettes of sycamore wood strung in packets on\nleathern strings.\n\nHamilcar, curious about these domestic details, listened to him and\ngrew calm with the monotony of the tones in which the figures were\nenumerated. Abdalonim became slower. Suddenly he let the wooden sheets\nfall to the ground and threw himself flat on his face with his arms\nstretched out in the position of a condemned criminal. Hamilcar picked\nup the tablets without any emotion; and his lips parted and his eyes\ngrew larger when he perceived an exorbitant consumption of meat, fish,\nbirds, wines, and aromatics, with broken vases, dead slaves, and spoiled\ncarpets set down as the expense of a single day.\n\nAbdalonim, still prostrate, told him of the feast of the Barbarians.\nHe had not been able to avoid the command of the Ancients. Moreover,\nSalammbo desired money to be lavished for the better reception of the\nsoldiers.\n\nAt his daughter's name Hamilcar leaped to his feet. Then with compressed\nlips he crouched down upon the cushions, tearing the fringes with his\nnails, and panting with staring eyes.\n\n\"Rise!\" said he; and he descended.\n\nAbdalonim followed him; his knees trembled. But seizing an iron bar he\nbegan like one distraught to loosen the paving stones. A wooden disc\nsprang up and soon there appeared throughout the length of the passage\nseveral of the large covers employed for stopping up the trenches in\nwhich grain was kept.\n\n\"You see, Eye of Baal,\" said the servant, trembling, \"they have not\ntaken everything yet! and these are each fifty cubits deep and filled up\nto the brim! During your voyage I had them dug out in the arsenals, in\nthe gardens, everywhere! your house is full of corn as your heart is\nfull of wisdom.\"\n\nA smile passed over Hamilcar's face. \"It is well, Abdalonim!\" Then\nbending over to his ear: \"You will have it brought from Etruria,\nBrutium, whence you will, and no matter at what price! Heap it and keep\nit! I alone must possess all the corn in Carthage.\"\n\nThen when they were alone at the extremity of the passage, Abdalonim,\nwith one of the keys hanging at his girdle, opened a large quadrangular\nchamber divided in the centre by pillars of cedar. Gold, silver, and\nbrass coins were arranged on tables or packed into niches, and rose\nas high as the joists of the roof along the four walls. In the corners\nthere were huge baskets of hippopotamus skin supporting whole rows of\nsmaller bags; there were hillocks formed of heaps of bullion on the\npavement; and here and there a pile that was too high had given way and\nlooked like a ruined column. The large Carthaginian pieces, representing\nTanith with a horse beneath a palm-tree, mingled with those from the\ncolonies, which were marked with a bull, star, globe, or crescent. Then\nthere might be seen pieces of all values, dimensions, and ages arrayed\nin unequal amounts--from the ancient coins of Assyria, slender as the\nnail, to the ancient ones of Latium, thicker than the hand, with the\nbuttons of Egina, the tablets of Bactriana, and the short bars of\nLacedaemon; many were covered with rust, or had grown greasy, or, having\nbeen taken in nets or from among the ruins of captured cities, were\ngreen with the water or blackened by fire. The Suffet had speedily\ncalculated whether the sums present corresponded with the gains and\nlosses which had just been read to him; and he was going away when he\nperceived three brass jars completely empty. Abdalonim turned away his\nhead to mark his horror, and Hamilcar, resigning himself to it, said\nnothing.\n\nThey crossed other passages and other halls, and at last reached a door\nwhere, to ensure its better protection and in accordance with a Roman\ncustom lately introduced into Carthage, a man was fastened by the waist\nto a long chain let into the wall. His beard and nails had grown to an\nimmoderate length, and he swayed himself from right to left with that\ncontinual oscillation which is characteristic of captive animals. As\nsoon as he recognised Hamilcar he darted towards him, crying:\n\n\"Pardon, Eye of Baal! pity! kill me! For ten years I have not seen the\nsun! In your father's name, pardon!\"\n\nHamilcar, without answering him, clapped his hands and three men\nappeared; and all four simultaneously stiffening their arms, drew back\nfrom its rings the enormous bar which closed the door. Hamilcar took a\ntorch and disappeared into the darkness.\n\nThis was believed to be the family burying-place; but nothing would have\nbeen found in it except a broad well. It was dug out merely to baffle\nrobbers, and it concealed nothing. Hamilcar passed along beside it; then\nstooping down he made a very heavy millstone turn upon its rollers, and\nthrough this aperture entered an apartment which was built in the shape\nof a cone.\n\nThe walls were covered with scales of brass; and in the centre, on a\ngranite pedestal, stood the statue of one of the Kabiri called Aletes,\nthe discoverer of the mines in Celtiberia. On the ground, at its base,\nand arranged in the form of a cross, were large gold shields and monster\nclose-necked silver vases, of extravagant shape and unfitted for use;\nit was customary to cast quantities of metal in this way, so that\ndilapidation and even removal should be almost impossible.\n\nWith his torch he lit a miner's lamp which was fastened to the idol's\ncap, and green, yellow, blue, violet, wine-coloured, and blood-coloured\nfires suddenly illuminated the hall. It was filled with gems which were\neither in gold calabashes fastened like sconces upon sheets of brass,\nor were ranged in native masses at the foot of the wall. There were\ncallaides shot away from the mountains with slings, carbuncles formed\nby the urine of the lynx, glossopetrae which had fallen from the moon,\ntyanos, diamonds, sandastra, beryls, with the three kinds of rubies, the\nfour kinds of sapphires, and the twelve kinds of emeralds. They gleamed\nlike splashes of milk, blue icicles, and silver dust, and shed their\nlight in sheets, rays, and stars. Ceraunia, engendered by the thunder,\nsparkled by the side of chalcedonies, which are a cure for poison. There\nwere topazes from Mount Zabarca to avert terrors, opals from Bactriana\nto prevent abortions, and horns of Ammon, which are placed under the bed\nto induce dreams.\n\nThe fires from the stones and the flames from the lamp were mirrored in\nthe great golden shields. Hamilcar stood smiling with folded arms, and\nwas less delighted by the sight of his riches than by the consciousness\nof their possession. They were inaccessible, exhaustless, infinite.\nHis ancestors sleeping beneath his feet transmitted something of their\neternity to his heart. He felt very near to the subterranean deities.\nIt was as the joy of one of the Kabiri; and the great luminous rays\nstriking upon his face looked like the extremity of an invisible net\nlinking him across the abysses with the centre of the world.\n\nA thought came which made him shudder, and placing himself behind the\nidol he walked straight up to the wall. Then among the tattooings on his\narm he scrutinised a horizontal line with two other perpendicular ones\nwhich in Chanaanitish figures expressed the number thirteen. Then he\ncounted as far as the thirteenth of the brass plates and again raised\nhis ample sleeve; and with his right hand stretched out he read other\nmore complicated lines on his arm, at the same time moving his fingers\ndaintily about like one playing on a lyre. At last he struck seven blows\nwith his thumb, and an entire section of the wall turned about in a\nsingle block.\n\nIt served to conceal a sort of cellar containing mysterious things which\nhad no name and were of incalculable value. Hamilcar went down the three\nsteps, took up a llama's skin which was floating on a black liquid in a\nsilver vat, and then re-ascended.\n\nAbdalonim again began to walk before him. He struck the pavement with\nhis tall cane, the pommel of which was adorned with bells, and before\nevery apartment cried aloud the name of Hamilcar amid eulogies and\nbenedictions.\n\nAlong the walls of the circular gallery, from which the passages\nbranched off, were piled little beams of algummim, bags of Lawsonia,\ncakes of Lemnos-earth, and tortoise carapaces filled with pearls. The\nSuffet brushed them with his robe as he passed without even looking at\nsome gigantic pieces of amber, an almost divine material formed by the\nrays of the sun.\n\nA cloud of odorous vapour burst forth.\n\n\"Push open the door!\"\n\nThey went in.\n\nNaked men were kneading pastes, crushing herbs, stirring coals, pouring\noil into jars, and opening and shutting the little ovoid cells which\nwere hollowed out all round in the wall, and were so numerous that\nthe apartment was like the interior of a hive. They were brimful of\nmyrobalan, bdellium, saffron, and violets. Gums, powders, roots, glass\nphials, branches of filipendula, and rose-petals were scattered about\neverywhere, and the scents were stifling in spite of the cloud-wreaths\nfrom the styrax shrivelling on a brazen tripod in the centre.\n\nThe Chief of the Sweet Odours, pale and long as a waxen torch, came up\nto Hamilcar to crush a roll of metopion in his hands, while two others\nrubbed his heels with leaves of baccharis. He repelled them; they were\nCyreneans of infamous morals, but valued on account of the secrets which\nthey possessed.\n\nTo show his vigilance the Chief of the Odours offered the Suffet a\nlittle malobathrum to taste in an electrum spoon; then he pierced three\nIndian bezoars with an awl. The master, who knew the artifices employed,\ntook a horn full of balm, and after holding it near the coals inclined\nit over his robe. A brown spot appeared; it was a fraud. Then he gazed\nfixedly at the Chief of the Odours, and without saying anything flung\nthe gazelle's horn full in his face.\n\nHowever indignant he might be at adulterations made to his own\nprejudice, when he perceived some parcels of nard which were being\npacked up for countries beyond the sea, he ordered antimony to be mixed\nwith it so as to make it heavier.\n\nThen he asked where three boxes of psagdas designed for his own use were\nto be found.\n\nThe Chief of the Odours confessed that he did not know; some soldiers\nhad come howling in with knives and he had opened the boxes for them.\n\n\"So you are more afraid of them then of me!\" cried the Suffet; and his\neyeballs flashed like torches through the smoke upon the tall, pale man\nwho was beginning to understand. \"Abdalonim! you will make him run the\ngauntlet before sunset: tear him!\"\n\nThis loss, which was less than the others, had exasperated him; for in\nspite of his efforts to banish them from his thoughts he was continually\ncoming again across the Barbarians. Their excesses were blended with his\ndaughter's shame, and he was angry with the whole household for knowing\nof the latter and for not speaking of it to him. But something impelled\nhim to bury himself in his misfortune; and in an inquisitorial fit he\nvisited the sheds behind the mercantile house to see the supplies of\nbitumen, wood, anchors and cordage, honey and wax, the cloth warehouse,\nthe stores of food, the marble yard and the silphium barn.\n\nHe went to the other side of the gardens to make an inspection in their\ncottages, of the domestic artisans whose productions were sold. There\nwere tailors embroidering cloaks, others making nets, others painting\ncushions or cutting out sandals, and Egyptian workmen polished papyrus\nwith a shell, while the weavers' shuttles rattled and the armourers'\nanvils rang.\n\nHamilcar said to them:\n\n\"Beat away at the swords! I shall want them.\" And he drew the antelope's\nskin that had been steeped in poisons from his bosom to have it cut\ninto a cuirass more solid than one of brass and unassailable by steel or\nflame.\n\nAs soon as he approached the workmen, Abdalonim, to give his wrath\nanother direction, tried to anger him against them by murmured\ndisparagement of their work. \"What a performance! It is a shame! The\nMaster is indeed too good.\" Hamilcar moved away without listening to\nhim.\n\nHe slackened his pace, for the paths were barred by great trees calcined\nfrom one end to the other, such as may be met with in woods where\nshepherds have encamped; and the palings were broken, the water in the\ntrenches was disappearing, while fragments of glass and the bones of\napes were to be seen amid the miry puddles. A scrap of cloth hung\nhere and there from the bushes, and the rotten flowers formed a yellow\nmuck-heap beneath the citron trees. In fact, the servants had neglected\neverything, thinking that the master would never return.\n\nAt every step he discovered some new disaster, some further proof of the\nthing which he had forbidden himself to learn. Here he was soiling his\npurple boots as he crushed the filth under-foot; and he had not all\nthese men before him at the end of a catapult to make them fly into\nfragments! He felt humiliated at having defended them; it was a delusion\nand a piece of treachery; and as he could not revenge himself upon\nthe soldiers, or the Ancients, or Salammbo, or anybody, and his wrath\nrequired some victim, he condemned all the slaves of the gardens to the\nmines at a single stroke.\n\nAbdalonim shuddered each time that he saw him approaching the parks. But\nHamilcar took the path towards the mill, from which there might be heard\nissuing a mournful melopoeia.\n\nThe heavy mill-stones were turning amid the dust. They consisted of two\ncones of porphyry laid the one upon the other--the upper one of the two,\nwhich carried a funnel, being made to revolve upon the second by means\nof strong bars. Some men were pushing these with their breasts and arms,\nwhile others were yoked to them and were pulling them. The friction of\nthe straps had formed purulent scabs round about their armpits such as\nare seen on asses' withers, and the end of the limp black rag, which\nscarcely covered their loins, hung down and flapped against their hams\nlike a long tail. Their eyes were red, the irons on their feet clanked,\nand all their breasts panted rhythmically. On their mouths they had\nmuzzles fastened by two little bronze chains to render it impossible\nfor them to eat the flour, and their hands were enclosed in gauntlets\nwithout fingers, so as to prevent them from taking any.\n\nAt the master's entrance the wooden bars creaked still more loudly. The\ngrain grated as it was being crushed. Several fell upon their knees; the\nothers, continuing their work, stepped across them.\n\nHe asked for Giddenem, the governor of the slaved, and that personage\nappeared, his rank being displayed in the richness of his dress. His\ntunic, which was slit up the sides, was of fine purple; his ears were\nweighted with heavy rings; and the strips of cloth enfolding his legs\nwere joined together with a lacing of gold which extended from his\nankles to his hips, like a serpent winding about a tree. In his fingers,\nwhich were laden with rings, he held a necklace of jet beads, so as to\nrecognise the men who were subject to the sacred disease.\n\nHamilcar signed to him to unfasten the muzzles. Then with the cries of\nfamished animals they all rushed upon the flour, burying their faces in\nthe heaps of it and devouring it.\n\n\"You are weakening them!\" said the Suffet.\n\nGiddenem replied that such treatment was necessary in order to subdue\nthem.\n\n\"It was scarcely worth while sending you to the slaves' school at\nSyracuse. Fetch the others!\"\n\nAnd the cooks, butlers, grooms, runners, and litter-carriers, the men\nbelonging to the vapour-baths, and the women with their children, all\nranged themselves in a single line in the garden from the mercantile\nhouse to the deer park. They held their breath. An immense silence\nprevailed in Megara. The sun was lengthening across the lagoon at the\nfoot of the catacombs. The peacocks were screeching. Hamilcar walked\nalong step by step.\n\n\"What am I to do with these old creatures?\" he said. \"Sell them! There\nare too many Gauls: they are drunkards! and too many Cretans: they are\nliars! Buy me some Cappadocians, Asiatics, and Negroes.\"\n\nHe was astonished that the children were so few. \"The house ought to\nhave births every year, Giddenem. You will leave the huts open every\nnight to let them mingle freely.\"\n\nHe then had the thieves, the lazy, and the mutinous shown to him. He\ndistributed punishments, with reproaches to Giddenem; and Giddenem,\nox-like, bent his low forehead, with its two broad intersecting\neyebrows.\n\n\"See, Eye of Baal,\" he said, pointing out a sturdy Libyan, \"here is one\nwho was caught with the rope round his neck.\"\n\n\"Ah! you wish to die?\" said the Suffet scornfully.\n\n\"Yes!\" replied the slave in an intrepid tone.\n\nThen, without heeding the precedent or the pecuniary loss, Hamilcar said\nto the serving-men:\n\n\"Away with him!\"\n\nPerhaps in his thoughts he intended a sacrifice. It was a misfortune\nwhich he inflicted upon himself in order to avert more terrible ones.\n\nGiddenem had hidden those who were mutilated behind the others. Hamilcar\nperceived them.\n\n\"Who cut off your arm?\"\n\n\"The soldiers, Eye of Baal.\"\n\nThen to a Samnite who was staggering like a wounded heron:\n\n\"And you, who did that to you?\"\n\nIt was the governor, who had broken his leg with an iron bar.\n\nThis silly atrocity made the Suffet indignant; he snatched the jet\nnecklace out of Giddenem's hands.\n\n\"Cursed be the dog that injures the flock! Gracious Tanith, to cripple\nslaves! Ah! you ruin your master! Let him be smothered in the dunghill.\nAnd those that are missing? Where are they? Have you helped the soldiers\nto murder them?\"\n\nHis face was so terrible that all the women fled. The slaves drew back\nand formed a large circle around them; Giddenem was frantically kissing\nhis sandals; Hamilcar stood upright with his arms raised above him.\n\nBut with his understanding as clear as in the sternest of his battles,\nhe recalled a thousand odious things, ignominies from which he had\nturned aside; and in the gleaming of his wrath he could once more see\nall his disasters simultaneously as in the lightnings of a storm.\nThe governors of the country estates had fled through terror of the\nsoldiers, perhaps through collusion with them; they were all deceiving\nhim; he had restrained himself too long.\n\n\"Bring them here!\" he cried; \"and brand them on the forehead with\nred-hot irons as cowards!\"\n\nThen they brought and spread out in the middle of the garden, fetters,\ncarcanets, knives, chains for those condemned to the mines, cippi for\nfastening the legs, numellae for confining the shoulders, and scorpions\nor whips with triple thongs terminating in brass claws.\n\nAll were placed facing the sun, in the direction of Moloch the Devourer,\nand were stretched on the ground on their stomachs or on their backs,\nthose, however, who were sentenced to be flogged standing upright\nagainst the trees with two men beside them, one counting the blows and\nthe other striking.\n\nIn striking he used both his arms, and the whistling thongs made the\nbark of the plane-trees fly. The blood was scattered like rain upon the\nfoliage, and red masses writhed with howls at the foot of the trees.\nThose who were under the iron tore their faces with their nails.\nThe wooden screws could be heard creaking; dull knockings resounded;\nsometimes a sharp cry would suddenly pierce the air. In the direction of\nthe kitchens, men were brisking up burning coals with fans amid\ntattered garments and scattered hair, and a smell of burning flesh was\nperceptible. Those who were under the scourge, swooning, but kept in\ntheir positions by the bonds on their arms, rolled their heads upon\ntheir shoulders and closed their eyes. The others who were watching\nthem began to shriek with terror, and the lions, remembering the feast\nperhaps, stretched themselves out yawning against the edge of the dens.\n\nThen Salammbo was seen on the platform of her terrace. She ran wildly\nabout it from left to right. Hamilcar perceived her. It seemed to him\nthat she was holding up her arms towards him to ask for pardon; with a\ngesture of horror he plunged into the elephants' park.\n\nThese animals were the pride of the great Punic houses. They had carried\ntheir ancestors, had triumphed in the wars, and they were reverenced as\nbeing the favourites of the Sun.\n\nThose of Megara were the strongest in Carthage. Before he went away\nHamilcar had required Abdalonim to swear that he would watch over them.\nBut they had died from their mutilations; and only three remained, lying\nin the middle of the court in the dust before the ruins of their manger.\n\nThey recognised him and came up to him. One had its ears horribly slit,\nanother had a large wound in its knee, while the trunk of the third was\ncut off.\n\nThey looked sadly at him, like reasonable creatures; and the one that\nhad lost its trunk tried by stooping its huge head and bending its hams\nto stroke him softly with the hideous extremity of its stump.\n\nAt this caress from the animal two tears started into his eyes. He\nrushed at Abdalonim.\n\n\"Ah! wretch! the cross! the cross!\"\n\nAbdalonim fell back swooning upon the ground.\n\nThe bark of a jackal rang from behind the purple factories, the blue\nsmoke of which was ascending slowly into the sky; Hamilcar paused.\n\nThe thought of his son had suddenly calmed him like the touch of a\ngod. He caught a glimpse of a prolongation of his might, an indefinite\ncontinuation of his personality, and the slaves could not understand\nwhence this appeasement had come upon him.\n\nAs he bent his steps towards the purple factories he passed before the\nergastulum, which was a long house of black stone built in a square pit\nwith a small pathway all round it and four staircases at the corners.\n\nIddibal was doubtless waiting until the night to finish his signal.\n\"There is no hurry yet,\" thought Hamilcar; and he went down into the\nprison. Some cried out to him: \"Return\"; the boldest followed him.\n\nThe open door was flapping in the wind. The twilight entered through\nthe narrow loopholes, and in the interior broken chains could be\ndistinguished hanging from the walls.\n\nThis was all that remained of the captives of war!\n\nThen Hamilcar grew extraordinarily pale, and those who were leaning\nover the pit outside saw him resting one hand against the wall to keep\nhimself from falling.\n\nBut the jackal uttered its cry three times in succession. Hamilcar\nraised his head; he did not speak a word nor make a gesture. Then when\nthe sun had completely set he disappeared behind the nopal hedge, and in\nthe evening he said as he entered the assembly of the rich in the temple\nof Eschmoun:\n\n\"Luminaries of the Baalim, I accept the command of the Punic forces\nagainst the army of the Barbarians!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE MACARAS\n\nIn the following day he drew two hundred and twenty-three thousand\nkikars of gold from the Syssitia, and decreed a tax of fourteen shekels\nupon the rich. Even the women contributed; payment was made in behalf\nof the children, and he compelled the colleges of priests to furnish\nmoney--a monstrous thing, according to Carthaginian customs.\n\nHe demanded all the horses, mules, and arms. A few tried to conceal\ntheir wealth, and their property was sold; and, to intimidate the\navarice of the rest, he himself gave sixty suits of armour, and fifteen\nhundred gomers of meal, which was as much as was given by the Ivory\nCompany.\n\nHe sent into Liguria to buy soldiers, three thousand mountaineers\naccustomed to fight with bears; they were paid for six moons in advance\nat the rate of four minae a day.\n\nNevertheless an army was wanted. But he did not, like Hanno, accept all\nthe citizens. First he rejected those engaged in sedentary occupations,\nand then those who were big-bellied or had a pusillanimous look; and he\nadmitted those of ill-repute, the scum of Malqua, sons of Barbarians,\nfreed men. For reward he promised some of the New Carthaginians complete\nrights of citizenship.\n\nHis first care was to reform the Legion. These handsome young fellows,\nwho regarded themselves as the military majesty of the Republic,\ngoverned themselves. He reduced their officers to the ranks; he treated\nthem harshly, made them run, leap, ascend the declivity of Byrsa at a\nsingle burst, hurl javelins, wrestle together, and sleep in the squares\nat night. Their families used to come to see them and pity them.\n\nHe ordered shorter swords and stronger buskins. He fixed the number of\nserving-men, and reduced the amount of baggage; and as there were three\nhundred Roman pila kept in the temple of Moloch, he took them in spite\nof the pontiff's protests.\n\nHe organised a phalanx of seventy-two elephants with those which\nhad returned from Utica, and others which were private property, and\nrendered them formidable. He armed their drivers with mallet and chisel\nto enable them to split their skulls in the fight if they ran away.\n\nHe would not allow his generals to be nominated by the Grand Council.\nThe Ancients tried to urge the laws in objection, but he set them aside;\nno one ventured to murmur again, and everything yielded to the violence\nof his genius.\n\nHe assumed sole charge of the war, the government, and the finances;\nand as a precaution against accusations he demanded the Suffet Hanno as\nexaminer of his accounts.\n\nHe set to work upon the ramparts, and had the old and now useless inner\nwalls demolished in order to furnish stones. But difference of fortune,\nreplacing the hierarchy of race, still kept the sons of the vanquished\nand those of the conquerors apart; thus the patricians viewed the\ndestruction of these ruins with an angry eye, while the plebeians,\nscarcely knowing why, rejoiced.\n\nThe troops defiled under arms through the streets from morning till\nnight; every moment the sound of trumpets was heard; chariots passed\nbearing shields, tents, and pikes; the courts were full of women engaged\nin tearing up linen; the enthusiasm spread from one to another, and\nHamilcar's soul filled the Republic.\n\nHe had divided his soldiers into even numbers, being careful to place\na strong man and a weak one alternately throughout the length of his\nfiles, so that he who was less vigorous or more cowardly might be at\nonce led and pushed forward by two others. But with his three thousand\nLigurians, and the best in Carthage, he could form only a simple phalanx\nof four thousand and ninety-six hoplites, protected by bronze helmets,\nand handling ashen sarissae fourteen cubits long.\n\nThere were two thousand young men, each equipped with a sling, a dagger,\nand sandals. He reinforced them with eight hundred others armed with\nround shields and Roman swords.\n\nThe heavy cavalry was composed of the nineteen hundred remaining\nguardsmen of the Legion, covered with plates of vermilion bronze, like\nthe Assyrian Clinabarians. He had further four hundred mounted archers,\nof those that were called Tarentines, with caps of weasel's skin,\ntwo-edged axes, and leathern tunics. Finally there were twelve hundred\nNegroes from the quarter of the caravans, who were mingled with the\nClinabarians, and were to run beside the stallions with one hand resting\non the manes. All was ready, and yet Hamilcar did not start.\n\nOften at night he would go out of Carthage alone and make his way beyond\nthe lagoon towards the mouths of the Macaras. Did he intend to join the\nMercenaries? The Ligurians encamped in the Mappalian district surrounded\nhis house.\n\nThe apprehensions of the rich appeared justified when, one day, three\nhundred Barbarians were seen approaching the walls. The Suffet opened\nthe gates to them; they were deserters; drawn by fear or by fidelity,\nthey were hastening to their master.\n\nHamilcar's return had not surprised the Mercenaries; according to their\nideas the man could not die. He was returning to fulfil his promise;--a\nhope by no means absurd, so deep was the abyss between Country and\nArmy. Moreover they did not believe themselves culpable; the feast was\nforgotten.\n\nThe spies whom they surprised undeceived them. It was a triumph for the\nbitter; even the lukewarm grew furious. Then the two sieges overwhelmed\nthen with weariness; no progress was being made; a battle would be\nbetter! Thus many men had left the ranks and were scouring the country.\nBut at news of the arming they returned; Matho leaped for joy. \"At last!\nat last!\" he cried.\n\nThen the resentment which he cherished against Salammbo was turned\nagainst Hamilcar. His hate could now perceive a definite prey; and as\nhis vengeance grew easier of conception he almost believed that he\nhad realised it and he revelled in it already. At the same time he was\nseized with a loftier tenderness, and consumed by more acrid desire.\nHe saw himself alternately in the midst of the soldiers brandishing\nthe Suffet's head on a pike, and then in the room with the purple bed,\nclasping the maiden in his arms, covering her face with kisses, passing\nhis hands over her long, black hair; and the imagination of this, which\nhe knew could never be realised, tortured him. He swore to himself that,\nsince his companions had appointed him schalishim, he would conduct the\nwar; the certainty that he would not return from it urged him to render\nit a pitiless one.\n\nHe came to Spendius and said to him:\n\n\"You will go and get your men! I will bring mine! Warn Autaritus! We are\nlost if Hamilcar attacks us! Do you understand me? Rise!\"\n\nSpendius was stupefied before such an air of authority. Matho usually\nallowed himself to be led, and his previous transports had quickly\npassed away. But just now he appeared at once calmer and more terrible;\na superb will gleamed in his eyes like the flame of sacrifice.\n\nThe Greek did not listen to his reasons. He was living in one of the\nCarthaginian pearl-bordered tents, drinking cool beverages from silver\ncups, playing at the cottabos, letting his hair grow, and conducting the\nsiege with slackness. Moreover, he had entered into communications with\nsome in the town and would not leave, being sure that it would open its\ngates before many days were over.\n\nNarr' Havas, who wandered about among the three armies, was at that\ntime with him. He supported his opinion, and even blamed the Libyan for\nwishing in his excess of courage to abandon their enterprise.\n\n\"Go, if you are afraid!\" exclaimed Matho; \"you promised us pitch,\nsulphur, elephants, foot-soldiers, horses! where are they?\"\n\nNarr' Havas reminded him that he had exterminated Hanno's last\ncohorts;--as to the elephants, they were being hunted in the woods,\nhe was arming the foot-soldiers, the horses were on their way; and the\nNumidian rolled his eyes like a woman and smiled in an irritating manner\nas he stroked the ostrich feather which fell upon his shoulder. In his\npresence Matho was at a loss for a reply.\n\nBut a man who was a stranger entered, wet with perspiration, scared,\nand with bleeding feet and loosened girdle; his breathing shook his\nlean sides enough to have burst them, and speaking in an unintelligible\ndialect he opened his eyes wide as if he were telling of some battle.\nThe king sprang outside and called his horsemen.\n\nThey ranged themselves in the plain before him in the form of a circle.\nNarr' Havas, who was mounted, bent his head and bit his lips. At last he\nseparated his men into two equal divisions, and told the first to wait;\nthen with an imperious gesture he carried off the others at a gallop and\ndisappeared on the horizon in the direction of the mountains.\n\n\"Master!\" murmured Spendius, \"I do not like these extraordinary\nchances--the Suffet returning, Narr' Havas going away--\"\n\n\"Why! what does it matter?\" said Matho disdainfully.\n\nIt was a reason the more for anticipating Hamilcar by uniting with\nAutaritus. But if the siege of the towns were raised, the inhabitants\nwould come out and attack them in the rear, while they would have the\nCarthaginians in front. After much talking the following measures were\nresolved upon and immediately executed.\n\nSpendius proceeded with fifteen thousand men as far as the bridge built\nacross the Macaras, three miles from Utica; the corners of it were\nfortified with four huge towers provided with catapults; all the paths\nand gorges in the mountains were stopped up with trunks of trees, pieces\nof rock, interlacings of thorn, and stone walls; on the summits heaps\nof grass were made which might be lighted as signals, and shepherds who\nwere able to see at a distance were posted at intervals.\n\nNo doubt Hamilcar would not, like Hanno, advance by the mountain of\nthe Hot Springs. He would think that Autaritus, being master of the\ninterior, would close the route against him. Moreover, a check at the\nopening of the campaign would ruin him, while if he gained a victory he\nwould soon have to make a fresh beginning, the Mercenaries being further\noff. Again, he could disembark at Cape Grapes and march thence upon one\nof the towns. But he would then find himself between the two armies,\nan indiscretion which he could not commit with his scanty forces.\nAccordingly he must proceed along the base of Mount Ariana, then turn\nto the left to avoid the mouths of the Macaras, and come straight to the\nbridge. It was there that Matho expected him.\n\nAt night he used to inspect the pioneers by torch-light. He would hasten\nto Hippo-Zarytus or to the works on the mountains, would come back\nagain, would never rest. Spendius envied his energy; but in the\nmanagement of spies, the choice of sentries, the working of the engines\nand all means of defence, Matho listened docilely to his companion. They\nspoke no more of Salammbo,--one not thinking about her, and the other\nbeing prevented by a feeling of shame.\n\nOften he would go towards Carthage, striving to catch sight of\nHamilcar's troops. His eyes would dart along the horizon; he would\nlie flat on the ground, and believe that he could hear an army in the\nthrobbing of his arteries.\n\nHe told Spendius that if Hamilcar did not arrive in three days he would\ngo with all his men to meet him and offer him battle. Two further days\nelapsed. Spendius restrained him; but on the morning of the sixth day he\ndeparted.\n\nThe Carthaginians were no less impatient for war than the Barbarians.\nIn tents and in houses there was the same longing and the same distress;\nall were asking one another what was delaying Hamilcar.\n\nFrom time to time he would mount to the cupola of the temple of Eschmoun\nbeside the Announcer of the Moons and take note of the wind.\n\nOne day--it was the third of the month of Tibby--they saw him descending\nfrom the Acropolis with hurried steps. A great clamour arose in the\nMappalian district. Soon the streets were astir, and the soldiers were\neverywhere beginning to arm themselves upon their breasts; then they ran\nquickly to the square of Khamon to take their places in the ranks. No\none was allowed to follow them or even to speak to them, or to approach\nthe ramparts; for some minutes the whole town was silent as a great\ntomb. The soldiers as they leaned on their lances were thinking, and the\nothers in the houses were sighing.\n\nAt sunset the army went out by the western gate; but instead of taking\nthe road to Tunis or making for the mountains in the direction of Utica,\nthey continued their march along the edge of the sea; and they soon\nreached the Lagoon, where round spaces quite whitened with salt\nglittered like gigantic silver dishes forgotten on the shore.\n\nThen the pools of water multiplied. The ground gradually became softer,\nand the feet sank in it. Hamilcar did not turn back. He went on still\nat their head; and his horse, which was yellow-spotted like a dragon,\nadvanced into the mire flinging froth around him, and with great\nstraining of the loins. Night--a moonless light--fell. A few cried out\nthat they were about to perish; he snatched their arms from them, and\ngave them to the serving-men. Nevertheless the mud became deeper and\ndeeper. Some had to mount the beasts of burden; others clung to the\nhorses' tails; the sturdy pulled the weak, and the Ligurian corps drove\non the infantry with the points of their pikes. The darkness increased.\nThey had lost their way. All stopped.\n\nThen some of the Suffet's slaves went on ahead to look for the buoys\nwhich had been placed at intervals by his order. They shouted through\nthe darkness, and the army followed them at a distance.\n\nAt last they felt the resistance of the ground. Then a whitish curve\nbecame dimly visible, and they found themselves on the bank of the\nMacaras. In spite of the cold no fires were lighted.\n\nIn the middle of the night squalls of wind arose. Hamilcar had the\nsoldiers roused, but not a trumpet was sounded: their captain tapped\nthem softly on the shoulder.\n\nA man of lofty stature went down into the water. It did not come up to\nhis girdle; it was possible to cross.\n\nThe Suffet ordered thirty-two of the elephants to be posted in the river\na hundred paces further on, while the others, lower down, would check\nthe lines of men that were carried away by the current; and holding\ntheir weapons above their heads they all crossed the Macaras as though\nbetween two walls. He had noticed that the western wind had driven the\nsand so as to obstruct the river and form a natural causeway across it.\n\nHe was now on the left bank in front of Utica, and in a vast plain, the\nlatter being advantageous for his elephants, which formed the strength\nof his army.\n\nThis feat of genius filled the soldiers with enthusiasm. They recovered\nextraordinary confidence. They wished to hasten immediately against the\nBarbarians; but the Suffet bade them rest for two hours. As soon as the\nsun appeared they moved into the plain in three lines--first came the\nelephants, and then the light infantry with the cavalry behind it, the\nphalanx marching next.\n\nThe Barbarians encamped at Utica, and the fifteen thousand about the\nbridge were surprised to see the ground undulating in the distance. The\nwind, which was blowing very hard, was driving tornadoes of sand before\nit; they rose as though snatched from the soil, ascended in great\nlight-coloured strips, then parted asunder and began again, hiding the\nPunic army the while from the Mercenaries. Owing to the horns, which\nstood up on the edge of the helmets, some thought that they could\nperceive a herd of oxen; others, deceived by the motion of the cloaks,\npretended that they could distinguish wings, and those who had travelled\na good deal shrugged their shoulders and explained everything by\nthe illusions of the mirage. Nevertheless something of enormous size\ncontinued to advance. Little vapours, as subtle as the breath, ran\nacross the surface of the desert; the sun, which was higher now, shone\nmore strongly: a harsh light, which seemed to vibrate, threw back\nthe depths of the sky, and permeating objects, rendered distance\nincalculable. The immense plain expanded in every direction beyond the\nlimits of vision; and the almost insensible undulations of the soil\nextended to the extreme horizon, which was closed by a great blue line\nwhich they knew to be the sea. The two armies, having left their tents,\nstood gazing; the people of Utica were massing on the ramparts to have a\nbetter view.\n\nAt last they distinguished several transverse bars bristling with level\npoints. They became thicker, larger; black hillocks swayed to and fro;\nsquare thickets suddenly appeared; they were elephants and lances. A\nsingle shout went up: \"The Carthaginians!\" and without signal or command\nthe soldiers at Utica and those at the bridge ran pell-mell to fall in a\nbody upon Hamilcar.\n\nSpendius shuddered at the name. \"Hamilcar! Hamilcar!\" he repeated,\npanting, and Matho was not there! What was to be done? No means of\nflight! The suddenness of the event, his terror of the Suffet, and above\nall, the urgent need of forming an immediate resolution, distracted him;\nhe could see himself pierced by a thousand swords, decapitated, dead.\nMeanwhile he was being called for; thirty thousand men would follow him;\nhe was seized with fury against himself; he fell back upon the hope of\nvictory; it was full of bliss, and he believed himself more intrepid\nthan Epaminondas. He smeared his cheeks with vermilion in order to\nconceal his paleness, then he buckled on his knemids and his cuirass,\nswallowed a patera of pure wine, and ran after his troops, who were\nhastening towards those from Utica.\n\nThey united so rapidly that the Suffet had not time to draw up his\nmen in battle array. By degrees he slackened his speed. The elephants\nstopped; they rocked their heavy heads with their chargings of ostrich\nfeathers, striking their shoulders the while with their trunks.\n\nBehind the intervals between them might be seen the cohorts of the\nvelites, and further on the great helmets of the Clinabarians,\nwith steel heads glancing in the sun, cuirasses, plumes, and waving\nstandards. But the Carthaginian army, which amounted to eleven thousand\nthree hundred and ninety-six men, seemed scarcely to contain them, for\nit formed an oblong, narrow at the sides and pressed back upon itself.\n\nSeeing them so weak, the Barbarians, who were thrice as numerous, were\nseized with extravagant joy. Hamilcar was not to be seen. Perhaps he\nhad remained down yonder? Moreover what did it matter? The disdain\nwhich they felt for these traders strengthened their courage; and before\nSpendius could command a manoeuvre they had all understood it, and\nalready executed it.\n\nThey were deployed in a long, straight line, overlapping the wings of\nthe Punic army in order to completely encompass it. But when there\nwas an interval of only three hundred paces between the armies, the\nelephants turned round instead of advancing; then the Clinabarians were\nseen to face about and follow them; and the surprise of the Mercenaries\nincreased when they saw the archers running to join them. So the\nCarthaginians were afraid, they were fleeing! A tremendous hooting broke\nout from among the Barbarian troops, and Spendius exclaimed from the top\nof his dromedary: \"Ah! I knew it! Forward! forward!\"\n\nThen javelins, darts, and sling-bullets burst forth simultaneously. The\nelephants feeling their croups stung by the arrows began to gallop more\nquickly; a great dust enveloped them, and they vanished like shadows in\na cloud.\n\nBut from the distance there came a loud noise of footsteps dominated by\nthe shrill sound of the trumpets, which were being blown furiously.\nThe space which the Barbarians had in front of them, which was full\nof eddies and tumult, attracted like a whirlpool; some dashed into it.\nCohorts of infantry appeared; they closed up; and at the same time\nall the rest saw the foot-soldiers hastening up with the horseman at a\ngallop.\n\nHamilcar had, in fact, ordered the phalanx to break its sections, and\nthe elephants, light troops, and cavalry to pass through the intervals\nso as to bring themselves speedily upon the wings, and so well had he\ncalculated the distance from the Barbarians, that at the moment when\nthey reached him, the entire Carthaginian army formed one long straight\nline.\n\nIn the centre bristled the phalanx, formed of syntagmata or full squares\nhaving sixteen men on each side. All the leaders of all the files\nappeared amid long, sharp lanceheads, which jutted out unevenly around\nthem, for the first six ranks crossed their sarissae, holding them in\nthe middle, and the ten lower ranks rested them upon the shoulders of\ntheir companions in succession before them. Their faces were all half\nhidden beneath the visors of their helmets; their right legs were all\ncovered with bronze knemids; broad cylindrical shields reached down to\ntheir knees; and the horrible quadrangular mass moved in a single body,\nand seemed to live like an animal and work like a machine. Two cohorts\nof elephants flanked it in regular array; quivering, they shook off the\nsplinters of the arrows that clung to their black skins. The Indians,\nsquatting on their withers among the tufts of white feathers, restrained\nthem with their spoon-headed harpoons, while the men in the towers, who\nwere hidden up to their shoulders, moved about iron distaffs furnished\nwith lighted tow on the edges of their large bended bows. Right and\nleft of the elephants hovered the slingers, each with a sling around his\nloins, a second on his head, and a third in his right hand. Then came\nthe Clinabarians, each flanked by a Negro, and pointing their lances\nbetween the ears of their horses, which, like themselves, were\ncompletely covered with gold. Afterwards, at intervals, came the light\narmed soldiers with shields of lynx skin, beyond which projected the\npoints of the javelins which they held in their left hands; while\nthe Tarentines, each having two coupled horses, relieved this wall of\nsoldiers at its two extremities.\n\nThe army of the Barbarians, on the contrary, had not been able to\npreserve its line. Undulations and blanks were to be found through\nits extravagant length; all were panting and out of breath with their\nrunning.\n\nThe phalanx moved heavily along with thrusts from all its sarissae;\nand the too slender line of the Mercenaries soon yielded in the centre\nbeneath the enormous weight.\n\nThen the Carthaginian wings expanded in order to fall upon them, the\nelephants following. The phalanx, with obliquely pointed lances, cut\nthrough the Barbarians; there were two enormous, struggling bodies; and\nthe wings with slings and arrows beat them back upon the phalangites.\nThere was no cavalry to get rid of them, except two hundred Numidians\noperating against the right squadron of the Clinabarians. All the rest\nwere hemmed in, and unable to extricate themselves from the lines. The\nperil was imminent, and the need of coming to some resolution urgent.\n\nSpendius ordered attacks to be made simultaneously on both flanks of the\nphalanx so as to pass clean through it. But the narrower ranks glided\nbelow the longer ones and recovered their position, and the phalanx\nturned upon the Barbarians as terrible in flank as it had just been in\nfront.\n\nThey struck at the staves of the sarissae, but the cavalry in the rear\nembarrassed their attack; and the phalanx, supported by the elephants,\nlengthened and contracted, presenting itself in the form of a square,\na cone, a rhombus, a trapezium, a pyramid. A twofold internal movement\nwent on continually from its head to its rear; for those who were at\nthe lowest part of the files hastened up to the first ranks, while the\nlatter, from fatigue, or on account of the wounded, fell further back.\nThe Barbarians found themselves thronged upon the phalanx. It was\nimpossible for it to advance; there was, as it were, an ocean wherein\nleaped red crests and scales of brass, while the bright shields rolled\nlike silver foam. Sometimes broad currents would descend from one\nextremity to the other, and then go up again, while a heavy mass\nremained motionless in the centre. The lances dipped and rose\nalternately. Elsewhere there was so quick a play of naked swords that\nonly the points were visible, while turmae of cavalry formed wide\ncircles which closed again like whirlwinds behind them.\n\nAbove the voices of the captains, the ringing of clarions and the\ngrating of tyres, bullets of lead and almonds of clay whistled through\nthe air, dashing the sword from the hand or the brain out of the skull.\nThe wounded, sheltering themselves with one arm beneath their shields,\npointed their swords by resting the pommels on the ground, while others,\nlying in pools of blood, would turn and bite the heels of those above\nthem. The multitude was so compact, the dust so thick, and the tumult\nso great that it was impossible to distinguish anything; the cowards who\noffered to surrender were not even heard. Those whose hands were empty\nclasped one another close; breasts cracked against cuirasses, and\ncorpses hung with head thrown back between a pair of contracted arms.\nThere was a company of sixty Umbrians who, firm on their hams, their\npikes before their eyes, immovable and grinding their teeth, forced two\nsyntagmata to recoil simultaneously. Some Epirote shepherds ran upon the\nleft squadron of the Clinabarians, and whirling their staves, seized the\nhorses by the man; the animals threw their riders and fled across the\nplain. The Punic slingers scattered here and there stood gaping. The\nphalanx began to waver, the captains ran to and fro in distraction,\nthe rearmost in the files were pressing upon the soldiers, and the\nBarbarians had re-formed; they were recovering; the victory was theirs.\n\nBut a cry, a terrible cry broke forth, a roar of pain and wrath: it came\nfrom the seventy-two elephants which were rushing on in double line,\nHamilcar having waited until the Mercenaries were massed together in\none spot to let them loose against them; the Indians had goaded them so\nvigorously that blood was trickling down their broad ears. Their trunks,\nwhich were smeared with mimium, were stretched straight out in the air\nlike red serpents; their breasts were furnished with spears and their\nbacks with cuirasses; their tusks were lengthened with steel blades\ncurved like sabres,--and to make them more ferocious they had been\nintoxicated with a mixture of pepper, wine, and incense. They shook\ntheir necklaces of bells, and shrieked; and the elephantarchs bent their\nheads beneath the stream of phalaricas which was beginning to fly from\nthe tops of the towers.\n\nIn order to resist them the better the Barbarians rushed forward in\na compact crowd; the elephants flung themselves impetuously upon the\ncentre of it. The spurs on their breasts, like ships' prows, clove\nthrough the cohorts, which flowed surging back. They stifled the men\nwith their trunks, or else snatching them up from the ground delivered\nthem over their heads to the soldiers in the towers; with their tusks\nthey disembowelled them, and hurled them into the air, and long entrails\nhung from their ivory fangs like bundles of rope from a mast. The\nBarbarians strove to blind them, to hamstring them; others would slip\nbeneath their bodies, bury a sword in them up to the hilt, and perish\ncrushed to death; the most intrepid clung to their straps; they would go\non sawing the leather amid flames, bullets, and arrows, and the wicker\ntower would fall like a tower of stone. Fourteen of the animals on the\nextreme right, irritated by their wounds, turned upon the second rank;\nthe Indians seized mallet and chisel, applied the latter to a joint in\nthe head, and with all their might struck a great blow.\n\nDown fell the huge beasts, falling one above another. It was like\na mountain; and upon the heap of dead bodies and armour a monstrous\nelephant, called \"The Fury of Baal,\" which had been caught by the leg in\nsome chains, stood howling until the evening with an arrow in its eye.\n\nThe others, however, like conquerors, delighting in extermination,\noverthrew, crushed, stamped, and raged against the corpses and the\ndebris. To repel the maniples in serried circles around them, they\nturned about on their hind feet as they advanced, with a continual\nrotatory motion. The Carthaginians felt their energy increase, and the\nbattle begin again.\n\nThe Barbarians were growing weak; some Greek hoplites threw away all\ntheir arms, and terror seized upon the rest. Spendius was seen stooping\nupon his dromedary, and spurring it on the shoulders with two javelins.\nThen they all rushed away from the wings and ran towards Utica.\n\nThe Clinabarians, whose horses were exhausted, did not try to overtake\nthem. The Ligurians, who were weakened by thirst, cried out for an\nadvance towards the river. But the Carthaginians, who were posted in the\ncentre of the syntagmata, and had suffered less, stamped their feet\nwith longing for the vengeance which was flying from them; and they\nwere already darting forward in pursuit of the Mercenaries when Hamilcar\nappeared.\n\nHe held in his spotted and sweat-covered horse with silver reins. The\nbands fastened to the horns on his helmet flapped in the wind behind\nhim, and he had placed his oval shield beneath his left thigh. With a\nmotion of his triple-pointed pike he checked the army.\n\nThe Tarentines leaped quickly upon their spare horses, and set off right\nand left towards the river and towards the town.\n\nThe phalanx exterminated all the remaining Barbarians at leisure. When\nthe swords appeared they would stretch out their throats and close their\neyelids. Others defended themselves to the last, and were knocked down\nfrom a distance with flints like mad dogs. Hamilcar had desired the\ntaking of prisoners, but the Carthaginians obeyed him grudgingly, so\nmuch pleasure did they derive from plunging their swords into the bodies\nof the Barbarians. As they were too hot they set about their work with\nbare arms like mowers; and when they desisted to take breath they would\nfollow with their eyes a horseman galloping across the country after a\nfleeing soldier. He would succeed in seizing him by the hair, hold him\nthus for a while, and then fell him with a blow of his axe.\n\nNight fell. Carthaginians and Barbarians had disappeared. The elephants\nwhich had taken to flight roamed in the horizon with their fired towers.\nThese burned here and there in the darkness like beacons nearly half\nlost in the mist; and no movement could be discerned in the plain save\nthe undulation of the river, which was heaped with corpses, and was\ndrifting them away to the sea.\n\nTwo hours afterwards Matho arrived. He caught sight in the starlight of\nlong, uneven heaps lying upon the ground.\n\nThey were files of Barbarians. He stooped down; all were dead. He called\ninto the distance, but no voice replied.\n\nThat very morning he had left Hippo-Zarytus with his soldiers to march\nupon Carthage. At Utica the army under Spendius had just set out, and\nthe inhabitants were beginning to fire the engines. All had fought\ndesperately. But, the tumult which was going on in the direction of\nthe bridge increasing in an incomprehensible fashion, Matho had struck\nacross the mountain by the shortest road, and as the Barbarians were\nfleeing over the plain he had encountered nobody.\n\nFacing him were little pyramidal masses rearing themselves in the shade,\nand on this side of the river and closer to him were motionless lights\non the surface of the ground. In fact the Carthaginians had fallen\nback behind the bridge, and to deceive the Barbarians the Suffet had\nstationed numerous posts upon the other bank.\n\nMatho, still advancing, thought that he could distinguish Punic engines,\nfor horses' heads which did not stir appeared in the air fixed upon\nthe tops of piles of staves which could not be seen; and further off he\ncould hear a great clamour, a noise of songs, and clashing of cups.\n\nThen, not knowing where he was nor how to find Spendius, assailed with\nanguish, scared, and lost in the darkness, he returned more impetuously\nby the same road. The dawn as growing grey when from the top of\nthe mountain he perceived the town with the carcases of the engines\nblackened by the flames and looking like giant skeletons leaning against\nthe walls.\n\nAll was peaceful amid extraordinary silence and heaviness. Among his\nsoldiers on the verge of the tents men were sleeping nearly naked, each\nupon his back, or with his forehead against his arm which was supported\nby his cuirass. Some were unwinding bloodstained bandages from their\nlegs. Those who were doomed to die rolled their heads about gently;\nothers dragged themselves along and brought them drink. The sentries\nwalked up and down along the narrow paths in order to warm themselves,\nor stood in a fierce attitude with their faces turned towards the\nhorizon, and their pikes on their shoulders. Matho found Spendius\nsheltered beneath a rag of canvas, supported by two sticks set in the\nground, his knee in his hands and his head cast down.\n\nThey remained for a long time without speaking.\n\nAt last Matho murmured: \"Conquered!\"\n\nSpendius rejoined in a gloomy voice: \"Yes, conquered!\"\n\nAnd to all questions he replied by gestures of despair.\n\nMeanwhile sighs and death-rattles reached them. Matho partially opened\nthe canvas. Then the sight of the soldiers reminded him of another\ndisaster on the same spot, and he ground his teeth: \"Wretch! once\nalready--\"\n\nSpendius interrupted him: \"You were not there either.\"\n\n\"It is a curse!\" exclaimed Matho. \"Nevertheless, in the end I will get\nat him! I will conquer him! I will slay him! Ah! if I had been there!--\"\nThe thought of having missed the battle rendered him even more desperate\nthan the defeat. He snatched up his sword and threw it upon the ground.\n\"But how did the Carthaginians beat you?\"\n\nThe former slave began to describe the manoeuvres. Matho seemed to\nsee them, and he grew angry. The army from Utica ought to have taken\nHamilcar in the rear instead of hastening to the bridge.\n\n\"Ah! I know!\" said Spendius.\n\n\"You ought to have made your ranks twice as deep, avoided exposing the\nvelites against the phalanx, and given free passage to the elephants.\nEverything might have been recovered at the last moment; there was no\nnecessity to fly.\"\n\nSpendius replied:\n\n\"I saw him pass along in his large red cloak, with uplifted arms\nand higher than the dust, like an eagle flying upon the flank of the\ncohorts; and at every nod they closed up or darted forward; the throng\ncarried us towards each other; he looked at me, and I felt the cold\nsteel as it were in my heart.\"\n\n\"He selected the day, perhaps?\" whispered Matho to himself.\n\nThey questioned each other, trying to discover what it was that had\nbrought the Suffet just when circumstances were most unfavourable.\nThey went on to talk over the situation, and Spendius, to extenuate his\nfault, or to revive his courage, asserted that some hope still remained.\n\n\"And if there be none, it matters not!\" said Matho; \"alone, I will carry\non the war!\"\n\n\"And I too!\" exclaimed the Greek, leaping up; he strode to and fro, his\neyes sparkling, and a strange smile wrinkled his jackal face.\n\n\"We will make a fresh start; do not leave me again! I am not made for\nbattles in the sunlight--the flashing of swords troubles my sight; it\nis a disease, I lived too long in the ergastulum. But give me walls to\nscale at night, and I will enter the citadels, and the corpses shall be\ncold before cock-crow! Show me any one, anything, an enemy, a treasure,\na woman,--a woman,\" he repeated, \"were she a king's daughter, and I will\nquickly bring your desire to your feet. You reproach me for having lost\nthe battle against Hanno, nevertheless I won it back again. Confess\nit! my herd of swine did more for us than a phalanx of Spartans.\" And\nyielding to the need that he felt of exalting himself and taking\nhis revenge, he enumerated all that he had done for the cause of the\nMercenaries. \"It was I who urged on the Gaul in the Suffet's gardens!\nAnd later, at Sicca, I maddened them all with fear of the Republic!\nGisco was sending them back, but I prevented the interpreters speaking.\nAh! how their tongues hung out of their mouths! do you remember? I\nbrought you into Carthage; I stole the zaimph. I led you to her. I will\ndo more yet: you shall see!\" He burst out laughing like a madman.\n\nMatho regarded him with gaping eyes. He felt in a measure uncomfortable\nin the presence of this man, who was at once so cowardly and so\nterrible.\n\nThe Greek resumed in jovial tones and cracking his fingers:\n\n\"Evoe! Sun after run! I have worked in the quarries, and I have drunk\nMassic wine beneath a golden awning in a vessel of my own like a\nPtolemaeus. Calamity should help to make us cleverer. By dint of work we\nmay make fortune bend. She loves politicians. She will yield!\"\n\nHe returned to Matho and took him by the arm.\n\n\"Master, at present the Carthaginians are sure of their victory. You\nhave quite an army which has not fought, and your men obey YOU. Place\nthem in the front: mine will follow to avenge themselves. I have still\nthree thousand Carians, twelve hundred slingers and archers, whole\ncohorts! A phalanx even might be formed; let us return!\"\n\nMatho, who had been stunned by the disaster, had hitherto thought of\nno means of repairing it. He listened with open mouth, and the bronze\nplates which circled his sides rose with the leapings of his heart. He\npicked up his sword, crying:\n\n\"Follow me; forward!\"\n\nBut when the scouts returned, they announced that the Carthaginian dead\nhad been carried off, that the bridge was in ruins, and that Hamilcar\nhad disappeared.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIN THE FIELD\n\nHamilcar had thought that the Mercenaries would await him at Utica, or\nthat they would return against him; and finding his forces insufficient\nto make or to sustain an attack, he had struck southwards along the\nright bank of the river, thus protecting himself immediately from a\nsurprise.\n\nHe intended first to wink at the revolt of the tribes and to detach them\nall from the cause of the Barbarians; then when they were quite isolated\nin the midst of the provinces he would fall upon them and exterminate\nthem.\n\nIn fourteen days he pacified the region comprised between Thouccaber\nand Utica, with the towns of Tignicabah, Tessourah, Vacca, and others\nfurther to the west. Zounghar built in the mountains, Assoura celebrated\nfor its temple, Djeraado fertile in junipers, Thapitis, and Hagour\nsent embassies to him. The country people came with their hands full of\nprovisions, implored his protection, kissed his feet and those of the\nsoldiers, and complained of the Barbarians. Some came to offer him bags\ncontaining heads of Mercenaries killed, so they said, by themselves, but\nwhich they had cut off corpses; for many had lost themselves in their\nflight, and were found dead here and there beneath the olive trees and\namong the vines.\n\nOn the morrow of his victory, Hamilcar, to dazzle the people, had sent\nto Carthage the two thousand captives taken on the battlefield. They\narrived in long companies of one hundred men each, all with their arms\nfastened behind their backs with a bar of bronze which caught them at\nthe nape of the neck, and the wounded, bleeding as they still were,\nrunning also along; horsemen followed them, driving them on with blows\nof the whip.\n\nThen there was a delirium of joy! People repeated that there were six\nthousand Barbarians killed; the others would not hold out, and the war\nwas finished; they embraced one another in the streets, and rubbed\nthe faces of the Pataec Gods with butter and cinnamomum to thank them.\nThese, with their big eyes, their big bodies, and their arms raised as\nhigh as the shoulder, seemed to live beneath their freshened paint, and\nto participate in the cheerfulness of the people. The rich left their\ndoors open; the city resounded with the noise of the timbrels; the\ntemples were illuminated every night, and the servants of the goddess\nwent down to Malqua and set up stages of sycamore-wood at the corners\nof the cross-ways, and prostituted themselves there. Lands were voted to\nthe conquerors, holocausts to Melkarth, three hundred gold crowns to the\nSuffet, and his partisans proposed to decree to him new prerogatives and\nhonours.\n\nHe had begged the Ancients to make overtures to Autaritus for exchanging\nall the Barbarians, if necessary, for the aged Gisco, and the other\nCarthaginians detained like him. The Libyans and Nomads composing the\narmy under Autaritus knew scarcely anything of these Mercenaries, who\nwere men of Italiote or Greek race; and the offer by the Republic of so\nmany Barbarians for so few Carthaginians, showed that the value of the\nformer was nothing and that of the latter considerable. They dreaded a\nsnare. Autaritus refused.\n\nThen the Ancients decreed the execution of the captives, although the\nSuffet had written to them not to put them to death. He reckoned\nupon incorporating the best of them with his own troops and of thus\ninstigating defections. But hatred swept away all circumspection.\n\nThe two thousand Barbarians were tied to the stelae of the tombs in\nthe Mappalian quarter; and traders, scullions, embroiderers, and even\nwomen,--the widows of the dead with their children--all who would,\ncame to kill them with arrows. They aimed slowly at them, the better to\nprolong their torture, lowering the weapon and then raising it in turn;\nand the multitude pressed forward howling. Paralytics had themselves\nbrought thither in hand-barrows; many took the precaution of bringing\ntheir food, and remained on the spot until the evening; others passed\nthe night there. Tents had been set up in which drinking went on. Many\ngained large sums by hiring out bows.\n\nThen all these crucified corpses were left upright, looking like so many\nred statues on the tombs, and the excitement even spread to the people\nof Malqua, who were the descendants of the aboriginal families, and were\nusually indifferent to the affairs of their country. Out of gratitude\nfor the pleasure it had been giving them they now interested themselves\nin its fortunes, and felt that they were Carthaginians, and the Ancients\nthought it a clever thing to have thus blended the entire people in a\nsingle act of vengeance.\n\nThe sanction of the gods was not wanting; for crows alighted from all\nquarters of the sky. They wheeled in the air as they flew with loud\nhoarse cries, and formed a huge cloud rolling continually upon itself.\nIt was seen from Clypea, Rhades, and the promontory of Hermaeum.\nSometimes it would suddenly burst asunder, its black spirals extending\nfar away, as an eagle clove the centre of it, and then departed again;\nhere and there on the terraces the domes, the peaks of the obelisks,\nand the pediments of the temples there were big birds holding human\nfragments in their reddened beaks.\n\nOwing to the smell the Carthaginians resigned themselves to unbind the\ncorpses. A few of them were burnt; the rest were thrown into the sea,\nand the waves, driven by the north wind, deposited them on the shore at\nthe end of the gulf before the camp of Autaritus.\n\nThis punishment had no doubt terrified the Barbarians, for from the top\nof Eschmoun they could be seen striking their tents, collecting their\nflocks, and hoisting their baggage upon asses, and on the evening of the\nsame day the entire army withdrew.\n\nIt was to march to and fro between the mountain of the Hot Springs\nand Hippo-Zarytus, and so debar the Suffet from approaching the Tyrian\ntowns, and from the possibility of a return to Carthage.\n\nMeanwhile the two other armies were to try to overtake him in the south,\nSpendius in the east, and Matho in the west, in such a way that all\nthree should unite to surprise and entangle him. Then they received a\nreinforcement which they had not looked for: Narr' Havas appeared with\nthree hundred camels laden with bitumen, twenty-five elephants, and six\nthousand horsemen.\n\nTo weaken the Mercenaries the Suffet had judged it prudent to occupy his\nattention at a distance in his own kingdom. From the heart of Carthage\nhe had come to an understanding with Masgaba, a Gaetulian brigand\nwho was seeking to found an empire. Strengthened by Punic money, the\nadventurer had raised the Numidian States with promises of freedom. But\nNarr' Havas, warned by his nurse's son, had dropped into Cirta, poisoned\nthe conquerors with the water of the cisterns, struck off a few heads,\nset all right again, and had just arrived against the Suffet more\nfurious than the Barbarians.\n\nThe chiefs of the four armies concerted the arrangements for the war. It\nwould be a long one, and everything must be foreseen.\n\nIt was agreed first to entreat the assistance of the Romans, and\nthis mission was offered to Spendius, but as a fugitive he dared not\nundertake it. Twelve men from the Greek colonies embarked at Annaba in\na sloop belonging to the Numidians. Then the chiefs exacted an oath\nof complete obedience from all the Barbarians. Every day the captains\ninspected clothes and boots; the sentries were even forbidden to use a\nshield, for they would often lean it against their lance and fall\nasleep as they stood; those who had any baggage trailing after them\nwere obliged to get rid of it; everything was to be carried, in Roman\nfashion, on the back. As a precaution against the elephants Matho\ninstituted a corps of cataphract cavalry, men and horses being hidden\nbeneath cuirasses of hippopotamus skin bristling with nails; and to\nprotect the horses' hoofs boots of plaited esparto-grass were made for\nthem.\n\nIt was forbidden to pillage the villages, or to tyrannise over the\ninhabitants who were not of Punic race. But as the country was becoming\nexhausted, Matho ordered the provisions to be served out to the soldiers\nindividually, without troubling about the women. At first the men shared\nwith them. Many grew weak for lack of food. It was the occasion of many\nquarrels and invectives, many drawing away the companions of the rest\nby the bait or even by the promise of their own portion. Matho commanded\nthem all to be driven away pitilessly. They took refuge in the camp\nof Autaritus; but the Gaulish and Libyan women forced them by their\noutrageous treatment to depart.\n\nAt last they came beneath the walls of Carthage to implore the\nprotection of Ceres and Proserpine, for in Byrsa there was a temple\nwith priests consecrated to these goddesses in expiation of the horrors\nformerly committed at the siege of Syracuse. The Syssitia, alleging\ntheir right to waifs and strays, claimed the youngest in order to sell\nthem; and some fair Lacedaemonian women were taken by New Carthaginians\nin marriage.\n\nA few persisted in following the armies. They ran on the flank of the\nsyntagmata by the side of the captains. They called to their husbands,\npulled them by the cloak, cursed them as they beat their breasts, and\nheld out their little naked and weeping children at arm's length. The\nsight of them was unmanning the Barbarians; they were an embarrassment\nand a peril. Several times they were repulsed, but they came back again;\nMatho made the horsemen belonging to Narr' Havas charge them with the\npoint of the lance; and on some Balearians shouting out to him that they\nmust have women, he replied: \"I have none!\"\n\nJust now he was invaded by the genius of Moloch. In spite of the\nrebellion of his conscience, he performed terrible deeds, imagining that\nhe was thus obeying the voice of a god. When he could not ravage the\nfields, Matho would cast stones into them to render them sterile.\n\nHe urged Autaritus and Spendius with repeated messages to make haste.\nBut the Suffet's operations were incomprehensible. He encamped at\nEidous, Monchar, and Tehent successively; some scouts believed that they\nsaw him in the neighbourhood of Ischiil, near the frontiers of Narr'\nHavas, and it was reported that he had crossed the river above Tebourba\nas though to return to Carthage. Scarcely was he in one place when he\nremoved to another. The routes that he followed always remained unknown.\nThe Suffet preserved his advantages without offering battle, and while\npursued by the Barbarians seemed to be leading them.\n\nThese marches and counter marches were still more fatiguing to the\nCarthaginians, and Hamilcar's forces, receiving no reinforcements,\ndiminished from day to day. The country people were now more backward\nin bringing him provisions. In every direction he encountered taciturn\nhesitation and hatred; and in spite of his entreaties to the Great\nCouncil no succour came from Carthage.\n\nIt was said, perhaps it was believed, that he had need of none. It was\na trick, or his complaints were unnecessary; and Hanno's partisans, in\norder to do him an ill turn, exaggerated the importance of his victory.\nThe troops which he commanded he was welcome to; but they were not\ngoing to supply his demands continually in that way. The war was quite\nburdensome enough! it had cost too much, and from pride the patricians\nbelonging to his faction supported him but slackly.\n\nThen Hamilcar, despairing of the Republic, took by force from the tribes\nall that he wanted for the war--grain, oil, wood, cattle, and men. But\nthe inhabitants were not long in taking flight. The villages passed\nthrough were empty, and the cabins were ransacked without anything being\ndiscerned in them. The Punic army was soon encompassed by a terrible\nsolitude.\n\nThe Carthaginians, who were furious, began to sack the provinces; they\nfilled up the cisterns and fired the houses. The sparks, being carried\nby the wind, were scattered far off, and whole forests were on fire on\nthe mountains; they bordered the valleys with a crown of flames, and\nit was often necessary to wait in order to pass beyond them. Then the\nsoldiers resumed their march over the warm ashes in the full glare of\nthe sun.\n\nSometimes they would see what looked like the eyes of a tiger cat\ngleaming in a bush by the side of the road. This was a Barbarian\ncrouching upon his heels, and smeared with dust, that he might not be\ndistinguished from the colour of the foliage; or perhaps when passing\nalong a ravine those on the wings would suddenly hear the rolling of\nstones, and raising their eyes would perceive a bare-footed man bounding\nalong through the openings of the gorge.\n\nMeanwhile Utica and Hippo-Zarytus were free since the Mercenaries\nwere no longer besieging them. Hamilcar commanded them to come to his\nassistance. But not caring to compromise themselves, they answered him\nwith vague words, with compliments and excuses.\n\nHe went up again abruptly into the North, determined to open up one of\nthe Tyrian towns, though he were obliged to lay siege to it. He required\na station on the coast, so as to be able to draw supplies and men from\nthe islands or from Cyrene, and he coveted the harbour of Utica as being\nthe nearest to Carthage.\n\nThe Suffet therefore left Zouitin and turned the lake of Hippo-Zarytus\nwith circumspection. But he was soon obliged to lengthen out his\nregiments into column in order to climb the mountain which separates\nthe two valleys. They were descending at sunset into its hollow,\nfunnel-shaped summit, when they perceived on the level of the ground\nbefore them bronze she-wolves which seemed to be running across the\ngrass.\n\nSuddenly large plumes arose and a terrible song burst forth, accompanied\nby the rhythm of flutes. It was the army under Spendius; for some\nCampanians and Greeks, in their execration of Carthage, had assumed the\nensigns of Rome. At the same time long pikes, shields of leopard's skin,\nlinen cuirasses, and naked shoulders were seen on the left. These were\nthe Iberians under Matho, the Lusitanians, Balearians, and Gaetulians;\nthe horses of Narr' Havas were heard to neigh; they spread around the\nhill; then came the loose rabble commanded by Autaritus--Gauls, Libyans,\nand Nomads; while the Eaters of Uncleanness might be recognised among\nthem by the fish bones which they wore in their hair.\n\nThus the Barbarians, having contrived their marches with exactness, had\ncome together again. But themselves surprised, they remained motionless\nfor some minutes in consultation.\n\nThe Suffet had collected his men into an orbicular mass, in such a way\nas to offer an equal resistance in every direction. The infantry were\nsurrounded by their tall, pointed shields fixed close to one another in\nthe turf. The Clinabarians were outside and the elephants at intervals\nfurther off. The Mercenaries were worn out with fatigue; it was better\nto wait till next day; and the Barbarians feeling sure of their victory\noccupied themselves the whole night in eating.\n\nThey lighted large bright fires, which, while dazzling themselves, left\nthe Punic army below them in the shade. Hamilcar caused a trench fifteen\nfeet broad and ten cubits deep to be dug in Roman fashion round his\ncamp, and the earth thrown out to be raised on the inside into a\nparapet, on which sharp interlacing stakes were planted; and at sunrise\nthe Mercenaries were amazed to perceive all the Carthaginians thus\nentrenched as if in a fortress.\n\nThey could recognise Hamilcar in the midst of the tents walking about\nand giving orders. His person was clad in a brown cuirass cut in little\nscales; he was followed by his horse, and stopped from time to time to\npoint out something with his right arm outstretched.\n\nThen more than one recalled similar mornings when, amid the din of\nclarions, he passed slowly before them, and his looks strengthened\nthem like cups of wine. A kind of emotion overcame them. Those, on the\ncontrary, who were not acquainted with Hamilcar, were mad with joy at\nhaving caught him.\n\nNevertheless if all attacked at once they would do one another mutual\ninjury in the insufficiency of space. The Numidians might dash through;\nbut the Clinabarians, who were protected by cuirasses, would crush them.\nAnd then how were the palisades to be crossed? As to the elephants, they\nwere not sufficiently well trained.\n\n\"You are all cowards!\" exclaimed Matho.\n\nAnd with the best among them he rushed against the entrenchment. They\nwere repulsed by a volley of stones; for the Suffet had taken their\nabandoned catapults on the bridge.\n\nThis want of success produced an abrupt change in the fickle minds\nof the Barbarians. Their extreme bravery disappeared; they wished to\nconquer, but with the smallest possible risk. According to Spendius they\nought to maintain carefully the position that they held, and starve out\nthe Punic army. But the Carthaginians began to dig wells, and as there\nwere mountains surrounding the hill, they discovered water.\n\nFrom the summit of their palisade they launched arrows, earth, dung,\nand pebbles which they gathered from the ground, while the six catapults\nrolled incessantly throughout the length of the terrace.\n\nBut the springs would dry up of themselves; the provisions would be\nexhausted, and the catapults worn out; the Mercenaries, who were\nten times as numerous, would triumph in the end. The Suffet devised\nnegotiations so as to gain time, and one morning the Barbarians found\na sheep's skin covered with writing within their lines. He justified\nhimself for his victory: the Ancients had forced him into the war, and\nto show them that he was keeping his word, he offered them the pillaging\nof Utica or Hippo-Zarytus at their choice; in conclusion, Hamilcar\ndeclared that he did not fear them because he had won over some\ntraitors, and thanks to them would easily manage the rest.\n\nThe Barbarians were disturbed: this proposal of immediate booty made\nthem consider; they were apprehensive of treachery, not suspecting a\nsnare in the Suffet's boasting, and they began to look upon one another\nwith mistrust. Words and steps were watched; terrors awaked them in\nthe night. Many forsook their companions and chose their army as fancy\ndictated, and the Gauls with Autaritus went and joined themselves with\nthe men of Cisalpine Gaul, whose language they understood.\n\nThe four chiefs met together every evening in Matho's tent, and\nsquatting round a shield, attentively moved backwards and forwards the\nlittle wooden figures invented by Pyrrhus for the representation of\nmanoeuvres. Spendius would demonstrate Hamilcar's resources, and with\noaths by all the gods entreat that the opportunity should not be wasted.\nMatho would walk about angry and gesticulating. The war against Carthage\nwas his own personal affair; he was indignant that the others should\ninterfere in it without being willing to obey him. Autaritus would\ndivine his speech from his countenance and applaud. Narr' Havas would\nelevate his chin to mark his disdain; there was not a measure he did not\nconsider fatal; and he had ceased to smile. Sighs would escape him as\nthough he were thrusting back sorrow for an impossible dream, despair\nfor an abortive enterprise.\n\nWhile the Barbarians deliberated in uncertainty, the Suffet increased\nhis defences: he had a second trench dug within the palisades, a second\nwall raised, and wooden towers constructed at the corners; and his\nslaves went as far as the middle of the outposts to drive caltrops into\nthe ground. But the elephants, whose allowances were lessened, struggled\nin their shackles. To economise the grass he ordered the Clinabarians to\nkill the least strong among the stallions. A few refused to do so, and\nhe had them decapitated. The horses were eaten. The recollection of\nthis fresh meat was a source of great sadness to them in the days that\nfollowed.\n\nFrom the bottom of the ampitheatre in which they were confined they\ncould see the four bustling camps of the Barbarians all around them on\nthe heights. Women moved about with leathern bottles on their heads,\ngoats strayed bleating beneath the piles of pikes; sentries were being\nrelieved, and eating was going on around tripods. In fact, the tribes\nfurnished them abundantly with provisions, and they did not themselves\nsuspect how much their inaction alarmed the Punic army.\n\nOn the second day the Carthaginians had remarked a troop of three\nhundred men apart from the rest in the camp of the nomads. These were\nthe rich who had been kept prisoners since the beginning of the war.\nSome Libyans ranged them along the edge of the trench, took their\nstation behind them, and hurled javelins, making themselves a rampart\nof their bodies. The wretched creatures could scarcely be recognised,\nso completely were their faces covered with vermin and filth. Their hair\nhad been plucked out in places, leaving bare the ulcers on their\nheads, and they were so lean and hideous that they were like mummies in\ntattered shrouds. A few trembled and sobbed with a stupid look; the rest\ncried out to their friends to fire upon the Barbarians. There was one\nwho remained quite motionless with face cast down, and without\nspeaking; his long white beard fell to his chain-covered hands; and the\nCarthaginians, feeling as it were the downfall of the Republic in the\nbottom of their hearts, recognised Gisco. Although the place was a\ndangerous one they pressed forward to see him. On his head had been\nplaced a grotesque tiara of hippopotamus leather incrusted with pebbles.\nIt was Autaritus's idea; but it was displeasing to Matho.\n\nHamilcar in exasperation, and resolved to cut his way through in one way\nor another, had the palisades opened; and the Carthaginians went at a\nfurious rate half way up the hill or three hundred paces. Such a flood\nof Barbarians descended upon them that they were driven back to their\nlines. One of the guards of the Legion who had remained outside was\nstumbling among the stones. Zarxas ran up to him, knocked him down, and\nplunged a dagger into his throat; he drew it out, threw himself upon the\nwound--and gluing his lips to it with mutterings of joy, and startings\nwhich shook him to the heels, pumped up the blood by breastfuls; then he\nquietly sat down upon the corpse, raised his face with his neck thrown\nback the better to breathe in the air, like a hind that has just drunk\nat a mountain stream, and in a shrill voice began to sing a Balearic\nsong, a vague melody full of prolonged modulations, with interruptions\nand alternations like echoes answering one another in the mountains; he\ncalled upon his dead brothers and invited them to a feast;--then he let\nhis hands fall between his legs, slowly bent his head, and wept. This\natrocious occurrence horrified the Barbarians, especially the Greeks.\n\nFrom that time forth the Carthaginians did not attempt to make any\nsally; and they had no thought of surrender, certain as they were that\nthey would perish in tortures.\n\nNevertheless the provisions, in spite of Hamilcar's carefulness,\ndiminished frightfully. There was not left per man more than ten\nk'hommers of wheat, three hins of millet, and twelve betzas of dried\nfruit. No more meat, no more oil, no more salt food, and not a grain of\nbarley for the horses, which might be seen stretching down their wasted\nnecks seeking in the dust for blades of trampled straw. Often the\nsentries on vedette upon the terrace would see in the moonlight a dog\nbelonging to the Barbarians coming to prowl beneath the entrenchment\namong the heaps of filth; it would be knocked down with a stone, and\nthen, after a descent had been effected along the palisades by means\nof the straps of a shield, it would be eaten without a word. Sometimes\nhorrible barkings would be heard and the man would not come up again.\nThree phalangites, in the fourth dilochia of the twelfth syntagmata,\nkilled one another with knives in a dispute about a rat.\n\nAll regretted their families, and their houses; the poor their\nhive-shaped huts, with the shells on the threshold and the hanging net,\nand the patricians their large halls filled with bluish shadows, where\nat the most indolent hour of the day they used to rest listening to the\nvague noise of the streets mingled with the rustling of the leaves as\nthey stirred in their gardens;--to go deeper into the thought of this,\nand to enjoy it more, they would half close their eyelids, only to be\nroused by the shock of a wound. Every minute there was some engagement,\nsome fresh alarm; the towers were burning, the Eaters of Uncleanness\nwere leaping across the palisades; their hands would be struck off with\naxes; others would hasten up; an iron hail would fall upon the tents.\nGalleries of rushen hurdles were raised as a protection against the\nprojectiles. The Carthaginians shut themselves up within them and\nstirred out no more.\n\nEvery day the sun coming over the hill used, after the early hours, to\nforsake the bottom of the gorge and leave them in the shade. The grey\nslopes of the ground, covered with flints spotted with scanty lichen,\nascended in front and in the rear, and above their summits stretched the\nsky in its perpetual purity, smoother and colder to the eye than a metal\ncupola. Hamilcar was so indignant with Carthage that he felt inclined to\nthrow himself among the Barbarians and lead them against her. Moreover,\nthe porters, sutlers, and slaves were beginning to murmur, while neither\npeople, nor Great Council, nor any one sent as much as a hope. The\nsituation was intolerable, especially owing to the thought that it would\nbecome worse.\n\nAt the news of the disaster Carthage had leaped, as it were, with anger\nand hate; the Suffet would have been less execrated if he had allowed\nhimself to be conquered from the first.\n\nBut time and money were lacking for the hire of other Mercenaries. As to\na levy of soldiers in the town, how were they to be equipped? Hamilcar\nhad taken all the arms! and then who was to command them? The best\ncaptains were down yonder with him! Meanwhile, some men despatched by\nthe Suffet arrived in the streets with shouts. The Great Council were\nroused by them, and contrived to make them disappear.\n\nIt was an unnecessary precaution; every one accused Barca of having\nbehaved with slackness. He ought to have annihilated the Mercenaries\nafter his victory. Why had he ravaged the tribes? The sacrifices\nalready imposed had been heavy enough! and the patricians deplored their\ncontributions of fourteen shekels, and the Syssitia their two hundred\nand twenty-three thousand gold kikars; those who had given nothing\nlamented like the rest. The populace was jealous of the New\nCarthaginians, to whom he had promised full rights of citizenship;\nand even the Ligurians, who had fought with such intrepidity, were\nconfounded with the Barbarians and cursed like them; their race became\na crime, the proof of complicity. The traders on the threshold of their\nshops, the workmen passing plumb-line in hand, the vendors of pickle\nrinsing their baskets, the attendants in the vapour baths and the\nretailers of hot drinks all discussed the operations of the campaign.\nThey would trace battle-plans with their fingers in the dust, and\nthere was not a sorry rascal to be found who could not have corrected\nHamilcar's mistakes.\n\nIt was a punishment, said the priests, for his long-continued impiety.\nHe had offered no holocausts; he had not purified his troops; he had\neven refused to take augurs with him; and the scandal of sacrilege\nstrengthened the violence of restrained hate, and the rage of betrayed\nhopes. People recalled the Sicilian disasters, and all the burden of\nhis pride that they had borne for so long! The colleges of the pontiffs\ncould not forgive him for having seized their treasure, and they\ndemanded a pledge from the Great Council to crucify him should he ever\nreturn.\n\nThe heats of the month of Eloul, which were excessive in that year, were\nanother calamity. Sickening smells rose from the borders of the Lake,\nand were wafted through the air together with the fumes of the aromatics\nthat eddied at the corners of the streets. The sounds of hymns were\nconstantly heard. Crowds of people occupied the staircases of the\ntemples; all the walls were covered with black veils; tapers burnt\non the brows of the Pataec Gods, and the blood of camels slain for\nsacrifice ran along the flights of stairs forming red cascades upon the\nsteps. Carthage was agitated with funereal delirium. From the depths of\nthe narrowest lanes, and the blackest dens, there issued pale faces,\nmen with viper-like profiles and grinding their teeth. The houses were\nfilled with the women's piercing shrieks, which, escaping through the\ngratings, caused those who stood talking in the squares to turn round.\nSometimes it was thought that the Barbarians were arriving; they had\nbeen seen behind the mountain of the Hot Springs; they were encamped at\nTunis; and the voices would multiply and swell, and be blended into one\nsingle clamour. Then universal silence would reign, some remaining where\nthey had climbed upon the frontals of the buildings, screening their\neyes with their open hand, while the rest lay flat on their faces at the\nfoot of the ramparts straining their ears. When their terror had passed\noff their anger would begin again. But the conviction of their own\nimpotence would soon sink them into the same sadness as before.\n\nIt increased every evening when all ascended the terraces, and bowing\ndown nine times uttered a loud cry in salutation of the sun, as it\nsank slowly behind the lagoon, and then suddenly disappeared among the\nmountains in the direction of the Barbarians.\n\nThey were waiting for the thrice holy festival when, from the summit\nof a funeral pile, an eagle flew heavenwards as a symbol of the\nresurrection of the year, and a message from the people to their Baal;\nthey regarded it as a sort of union, a method of connecting themselves\nwith the might of the Sun. Moreover, filled as they now were with\nhatred, they turned frankly towards homicidal Moloch, and all forsook\nTanith. In fact, Rabetna, having lost her veil, was as if she had been\ndespoiled of part of her virtue. She denied the beneficence of her\nwaters, she had abandoned Carthage; she was a deserter, an enemy.\nSome threw stones at her to insult her. But many pitied her while they\ninveighed against her; she was still beloved, and perhaps more deeply\nthan she had been.\n\nAll their misfortunes came, therefore, from the loss of the zaimph.\nSalammbo had indirectly participated in it; she was included in the same\nill will; she must be punished. A vague idea of immolation spread among\nthe people. To appease the Baalim it was without doubt necessary to\noffer them something of incalculable worth, a being handsome, young,\nvirgin, of old family, a descendant of the gods, a human star. Every day\nthe gardens of Megara were invaded by strange men; the slaves, trembling\non their own account, dared not resist them. Nevertheless, they did not\npass beyond the galley staircase. They remained below with their eyes\nraised to the highest terrace; they were waiting for Salammbo, and they\nwould cry out for hours against her like dogs baying at the moon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE SERPENT\n\nThese clamourings of the populace did not alarm Hamilcar's daughter. She\nwas disturbed by loftier anxieties: her great serpent, the black python,\nwas drooping; and in the eyes of the Carthaginians, the serpent was\nat once a national and a private fetish. It was believed to be the\noffspring of the dust of the earth, since it emerges from its depths and\nhas no need of feet to traverse it; its mode of progression called to\nmind the undulations of rivers, its temperature the ancient, viscous,\nand fecund darkness, and the orbit which it describes when biting its\ntail the harmony of the planets, and the intelligence of Eschmoun.\n\nSalammbo's serpent had several times already refused the four live\nsparrows which were offered to it at the full moon and at every new\nmoon. Its handsome skin, covered like the firmament with golden spots\nupon a perfectly black ground, was now yellow, relaxed, wrinkled, and\ntoo large for its body. A cottony mouldiness extended round its head;\nand in the corners of its eyelids might be seen little red specks which\nappeared to move. Salammbo would approach its silver-wire basket from\ntime to time, and would draw aside the purple curtains, the lotus\nleaves, and the bird's down; but it was continually rolled up upon\nitself, more motionless than a withered bind-weed; and from looking at\nit she at last came to feel a kind of spiral within her heart, another\nserpent, as it were, mounting up to her throat by degrees and strangling\nher.\n\nShe was in despair of having seen the zaimph, and yet she felt a sort\nof joy, an intimate pride at having done so. A mystery shrank within the\nsplendour of its folds; it was the cloud that enveloped the gods, and\nthe secret of the universal existence, and Salammbo, horror-stricken at\nherself, regretted that she had not raised it.\n\nShe was almost always crouching at the back of her apartment, holding\nher bended left leg in her hands, her mouth half open, her chin sunk,\nher eye fixed. She recollected her father's face with terror; she wished\nto go away into the mountains of Phoenicia, on a pilgrimage to the\ntemple of Aphaka, where Tanith descended in the form of a star; all\nkinds of imaginings attracted her and terrified her; moreover, a\nsolitude which every day became greater encompassed her. She did not\neven know what Hamilcar was about.\n\nWearied at last with her thoughts she would rise, and trailing along\nher little sandals whose soles clacked upon her heels at every step, she\nwould walk at random through the large silent room. The amethysts and\ntopazes of the ceiling made luminous spots quiver here and there, and\nSalammbo as she walked would turn her head a little to see them. She\nwould go and take the hanging amphoras by the neck; she would cool\nher bosom beneath the broad fans, or perhaps amuse herself by burning\ncinnamomum in hollow pearls. At sunset Taanach would draw back the black\nfelt lozenges that closed the openings in the wall; then her doves,\nrubbed with musk like the doves of Tanith, suddenly entered, and their\npink feet glided over the glass pavement, amid the grains of barley\nwhich she threw to them in handfuls like a sower in a field. But on a\nsudden she would burst into sobs and lie stretched on the large bed of\nox-leather straps without moving, repeating a word that was ever the\nsame, with open eyes, pale as one dead, insensible, cold; and yet she\ncould hear the cries of the apes in the tufts of the palm trees, with\nthe continuous grinding of the great wheel which brought a flow of pure\nwater through the stories into the porphyry centre-basin.\n\nSometimes for several days she would refuse to eat. She could see in\na dream troubled stars wandering beneath her feet. She would call\nSchahabarim, and when he came she had nothing to say to him.\n\nShe could not live without the relief of his presence. But she rebelled\ninwardly against this domination; her feeling towards the priest was one\nat once of terror, jealousy, hatred, and a species of love, in gratitude\nfor the singular voluptuousness which she experienced by his side.\n\nHe had recognised the influence of Rabbet, being skilful to discern\nthe gods who send diseases; and to cure Salammbo he had her apartment\nwatered with lotions of vervain, and maidenhair; she ate mandrakes every\nmorning; she slept with her head on a cushion filled with aromatics\nblended by the pontiffs; he had even employed baaras, a fiery-coloured\nroot which drives back fatal geniuses into the North; lastly, turning\ntowards the polar star, he murmured thrice the mysterious name of\nTanith; but Salammbo still suffered and her anguish deepened.\n\nNo one in Carthage was so learned as he. In his youth he had studied at\nthe College of the Mogbeds, at Borsippa, near Babylon; had then visited\nSamothrace, Pessinus, Ephesus, Thessaly, Judaea, and the temples of the\nNabathae, which are lost in the sands; and had travelled on foot along\nthe banks of the Nile from the cataracts to the sea. Shaking torches\nwith veil-covered face, he had cast a black cock upon a fire of\nsandarach before the breast of the Sphinx, the Father of Terror. He had\ndescended into the caverns of Proserpine; he had seen the five hundred\npillars of the labyrinth of Lemnos revolve, and the candelabrum of\nTarentum, which bore as many sconces on its shaft as there are days in\nthe year, shine in its splendour; at times he received Greeks by night\nin order to question them. The constitution of the world disquieted him\nno less than the nature of the gods; he had observed the equinoxes with\nthe armils placed in the portico of Alexandria, and accompanied the\nbematists of Evergetes, who measure the sky by calculating the number\nof their steps, as far as Cyrene; so that there was now growing in his\nthoughts a religion of his own, with no distinct formula, and on that\nvery account full of infatuation and fervour. He no longer believed that\nthe earth was formed like a fir-cone; he believed it to be round, and\neternally falling through immensity with such prodigious speed that its\nfall was not perceived.\n\nFrom the position of the sun above the moon he inferred the predominance\nof Baal, of whom the planet itself is but the reflection and figure;\nmoreover, all that he saw in terrestrial things compelled him to\nrecognise the male exterminating principle as supreme. And then he\nsecretly charged Rabbet with the misfortune of his life. Was it not for\nher that the grand-pontiff had once advanced amid the tumult of cymbals,\nand with a patera of boiling water taken from him his future virility?\nAnd he followed with a melancholy gaze the men who were disappearing\nwith the priestesses in the depths of the turpentine trees.\n\nHis days were spent in inspecting the censers, the gold vases, the\ntongs, the rakes for the ashes of the altar, and all the robes of the\nstatues down to the bronze bodkin that served to curl the hair of an old\nTanith in the third aedicule near the emerald vine. At the same hours he\nwould raise the great hangings of the same swinging doors; would remain\nwith his arms outspread in the same attitude; or prayed prostrate on the\nsame flag-stones, while around him a people of priests moved barefooted\nthrough the passages filled with an eternal twilight.\n\nBut Salammbo was in the barrenness of his life like a flower in the\ncleft of a sepulchre. Nevertheless he was hard upon her, and spared\nher neither penances nor bitter words. His condition established, as it\nwere, the equality of a common sex between them, and he was less angry\nwith the girl for his inability to possess her than for finding her so\nbeautiful, and above all so pure. Often he saw that she grew weary of\nfollowing his thought. Then he would turn away sadder than before; he\nwould feel himself more forsaken, more empty, more alone.\n\nStrange words escaped him sometimes, which passed before Salammbo like\nbroad lightnings illuminating the abysses. This would be at night on the\nterrace when, both alone, they gazed upon the stars, and Carthage spread\nbelow under their feet, with the gulf and the open sea dimly lost in the\ncolour of the darkness.\n\nHe would set forth to her the theory of the souls that descend upon\nthe earth, following the same route as the sun through the signs of the\nzodiac. With outstretched arm he showed the gate of human generation in\nthe Ram, and that of the return to the gods in Capricorn; and Salammbo\nstrove to see them, for she took these conceptions for realities;\nshe accepted pure symbols and even manners of speech as being true in\nthemselves, a distinction not always very clear even to the priest.\n\n\"The souls of the dead,\" said he, \"resolve themselves into the moon, as\ntheir bodies do into the earth. Their tears compose its humidity; 'tis a\ndark abode full of mire, and wreck, and tempest.\"\n\nShe asked what would become of her then.\n\n\"At first you will languish as light as a vapour hovering upon the\nwaves; and after more lengthened ordeals and agonies, you will pass into\nthe forces of the sun, the very source of Intelligence!\"\n\nHe did not speak, however, of Rabbet. Salammbo imagined that it was\nthrough some shame for his vanquished goddess, and calling her by a\ncommon name which designated the moon, she launched into blessings upon\nthe soft and fertile planet. At last he exclaimed:\n\n\"No! no! she draws all her fecundity from the other! Do you not see\nher hovering about him like an amorous woman running after a man in a\nfield?\" And he exalted the virtue of light unceasingly.\n\nFar from depressing her mystic desires, he sought, on the contrary,\nto excite them, and he even seemed to take joy in grieving her by the\nrevelation of a pitiless doctrine. In spite of the pains of her love\nSalammbo threw herself upon it with transport.\n\nBut the more that Schahabarim felt himself in doubt about Tanith, the\nmore he wished to believe in her. At the bottom of his soul he was\narrested by remorse. He needed some proof, some manifestation from the\ngods, and in the hope of obtaining it the priest devised an enterprise\nwhich might save at once his country and his belief.\n\nThenceforward he set himself to deplore before Salammbo the sacrilege\nand the misfortunes which resulted from it even in the regions of\nthe sky. Then he suddenly announced the peril of the Suffet, who was\nassailed by three armies under the command of Matho--for on account of\nthe veil Matho was, in the eyes of the Carthaginians, the king, as it\nwere, of the Barbarians,--and he added that the safety of the Republic\nand of her father depended upon her alone.\n\n\"Upon me!\" she exclaimed. \"How can I--?\"\n\nBut the priest, with a smile of disdain said:\n\n\"You will never consent!\"\n\nShe entreated him. At last Schahabarim said to her:\n\n\"You must go to the Barbarians and recover the zaimph!\"\n\nShe sank down upon the ebony stool, and remained with her arms stretched\nout between her knees and shivering in all her limbs, like a victim\nat the altar's foot awaiting the blow of the club. Her temples were\nringing, she could see fiery circles revolving, and in her stupor\nshe had lost the understanding of all things save one, that she was\ncertainly going to die soon.\n\nBut if Rabbetna triumphed, if the zaimph were restored and Carthage\ndelivered, what mattered a woman's life? thought Schahabarim. Moreover,\nshe would perhaps obtain the veil and not perish.\n\nHe stayed away for three days; on the evening of the fourth she sent for\nhim.\n\nThe better to inflame her heart he reported to her all the invectives\nhowled against Hamilcar in open council; he told her that she had erred,\nthat she owed reparation for her crime, and that Rabbetna commanded the\nsacrifice.\n\nA great uproar came frequently across the Mappalian district to Megara.\nSchahabarim and Salammbo went out quickly, and gazed from the top of the\ngalley staircase.\n\nThere were people in the square of Khamon shouting for arms. The\nAncients would not provide them, esteeming such an effort useless;\nothers who had set out without a general had been massacred. At last\nthey were permitted to depart, and as a sort of homage to Moloch, or\nfrom a vague need of destruction, they tore up tall cypress trees in\nthe woods of the temples, and having kindled them at the torches of the\nKabiri, were carrying them through the streets singing. These monstrous\nflames advanced swaying gently; they transmitted fires to the glass\nballs on the crests of the temples, to the ornaments of the colossuses\nand the beaks of the ships, passed beyond the terraces and formed suns\nas it were, which rolled through the town. They descended the Acropolis.\nThe gate of Malqua opened.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" exclaimed Schahabarim, \"or have you asked them to tell\nyour father that you abandoned him?\" She hid her face in her veils, and\nthe great lights retired, sinking gradually the while to the edge of the\nwaves.\n\nAn indeterminate dread restrained her; she was afraid of Moloch and of\nMatho. This man, with his giant stature, who was master of the zaimph,\nruled Rabbetna as much as did Baal, and seemed to her to be surrounded\nby the same fulgurations; and then the souls of the gods sometimes\nvisited the bodies of men. Did not Schahabarim in speaking of him say\nthat she was to vanquish Moloch? They were mingled with each other; she\nconfused them together; both of them were pursuing her.\n\nShe wished to learn the future, and approached the serpent, for auguries\nwere drawn from the attitudes of serpents. But the basket was empty;\nSalammbo was disturbed.\n\nShe found him with his tail rolled round one of the silver balustrades\nbeside the hanging bed, which he was rubbing in order to free himself\nfrom his old yellowish skin, while his body stretched forth gleaming and\nclear like a sword half out of the sheath.\n\nThen on the days following, in proportion as she allowed herself to be\nconvinced, and was more disposed to succour Tanith, the python recovered\nand grew; he seemed to be reviving.\n\nThe certainty that Salammbo was giving expression to the will of the\ngods then became established in her conscience. One morning she awoke\nresolved, and she asked what was necessary to make Matho restore the\nveil.\n\n\"To claim it,\" said Schahabarim.\n\n\"But if he refuses?\" she rejoined.\n\nThe priest scanned her fixedly with a smile such as she had never seen.\n\n\"Yes, what is to be done?\" repeated Salammbo.\n\nHe rolled between his fingers the extremities of the bands which fell\nfrom his tiara upon his shoulders, standing motionless with eyes cast\ndown. At last seeing that she did not understand:\n\n\"You will be alone with him.\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"Alone in his tent.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\nSchahabarim bit his lips. He sought for some phrase, some\ncircumlocution.\n\n\"If you are to die, that will be later,\" he said; \"later! fear nothing!\nand whatever he may undertake to do, do not call out! do not be\nfrightened! You will be humble, you understand, and submissive to his\ndesire, which is ordained of heaven!\"\n\n\"But the veil?\"\n\n\"The gods will take thought for it,\" replied Schahabarim.\n\n\"Suppose you were to accompany me, O father?\" she added.\n\n\"No!\"\n\nHe made her kneel down, and keeping his left hand raised and his right\nextended, he swore in her behalf to bring back the mantle of Tanith into\nCarthage. With terrible imprecations she devoted herself to the gods,\nand each time that Schahabarim pronounced a word she falteringly\nrepeated it.\n\nHe indicated to her all the purifications and fastings that she was to\nobserve, and how she was to reach Matho. Moreover, a man acquainted with\nthe routes would accompany her.\n\nShe felt as if she had been set free. She thought only of the happiness\nof seeing the zaimph again, and she now blessed Schahabarim for his\nexhortations.\n\nIt was the period at which the doves of Carthage migrated to Sicily to\nthe mountain of Eryx and the temple of Venus. For several days before\ntheir departure they sought out and called to one another so as to\ncollect together; at last one evening they flew away; the wind blew them\nalong, and the big white cloud glided across the sky high above the sea.\n\nThe horizon was filled with the colour of blood. They seemed to descend\ngradually to the waves; then they disappeared as though swallowed\nup, and falling of themselves into the jaws of the sun. Salammbo, who\nwatched them retiring, bent her head, and then Taanach, believing that\nshe guessed her sorrow, said gently to her:\n\n\"But they will come back, Mistress.\"\n\n\"Yes! I know.\"\n\n\"And you will see them again.\"\n\n\"Perhaps!\" she said, sighing.\n\nShe had not confided her resolve to any one; in order to carry it out\nwith the greater discretion she sent Taanach to the suburb of Kinisdo to\nbuy all the things that she required instead of requesting them from the\nstewards: vermilion, aromatics, a linen girdle, and new garments. The\nold slave was amazed at these preparations, without daring, however,\nto ask any questions; and the day, which had been fixed by Schahabarim,\narrived when Salammbo was to set out.\n\nAbout the twelfth hour she perceived, in the depths of the sycamore\ntrees, a blind old man with one hand resting on the shoulder of a child\nwho walked before him, while with the other he carried a kind of cithara\nof black wood against his hip. The eunuchs, slaves, and women had\nbeen scrupulously sent away; no one might know the mystery that was\npreparing.\n\nTaanach kindled four tripods filled with strobus and cadamomum in the\ncorners of the apartment; then she unfolded large Babylonian hangings,\nand stretched them on cords all around the room, for Salammbo did not\nwish to be seen even by the walls. The kinnor-player squatted behind\nthe door and the young boy standing upright applied a reed flute to\nhis lips. In the distance the roar of the streets was growing feebler,\nviolet shadows were lengthening before the peristyles of the temples,\nand on the other side of the gulf the mountain bases, the fields of\nolive-trees, and the vague yellow lands undulated indefinitely, and were\nblended together in a bluish haze; not a sound was to be heard, and an\nunspeakable depression weighed in the air.\n\nSalammbo crouched down upon the onyx step on the edge of the basin; she\nraised her ample sleeves, fastening them behind her shoulders, and began\nher ablutions in methodical fashion, according to the sacred rites.\n\nNext Taanach brought her something liquid and coagulated in an alabaster\nphial; it was the blood of a black dog slaughtered by barren women on a\nwinter's night amid the rubbish of a sepulchre. She rubbed it upon her\nears, her heels, and the thumb of her right hand, and even her nail\nremained somewhat red, as if she had crushed a fruit.\n\nThe moon rose; then the cithara and the flute began to play together.\n\nSalammbo unfastened her earrings, her necklace, her bracelets, and her\nlong white simar; she unknotted the band in her hair, shaking the latter\nfor a few minutes softly over her shoulders to cool herself by thus\nscattering it. The music went on outside; it consisted of three notes\never the same, hurried and frenzied; the strings grated, the flute blew;\nTaanach kept time by striking her hands; Salammbo, with a swaying of\nher whole body, chanted prayers, and her garments fell one after another\naround her.\n\nThe heavy tapestry trembled, and the python's head appeared above the\ncord that supported it. The serpent descended slowly like a drop of\nwater flowing along a wall, crawled among the scattered stuffs, and\nthen, gluing its tail to the ground, rose perfectly erect; and his eyes,\nmore brilliant than carbuncles, darted upon Salammbo.\n\nA horror of cold, or perhaps a feeling of shame, at first made her\nhesitate. But she recalled Schahabarim's orders and advanced; the python\nturned downwards, and resting the centre of its body upon the nape of\nher neck, allowed its head and tail to hang like a broken necklace with\nboth ends trailing to the ground. Salammbo rolled it around her sides,\nunder her arms and between her knees; then taking it by the jaw she\nbrought the little triangular mouth to the edge of her teeth, and half\nshutting her eyes, threw herself back beneath the rays of the moon. The\nwhite light seemed to envelop her in a silver mist, the prints of her\nhumid steps shone upon the flag-stones, stars quivered in the depth of\nthe water; it tightened upon her its black rings that were spotted with\nscales of gold. Salammbo panted beneath the excessive weight, her\nloins yielded, she felt herself dying, and with the tip of its tail the\nserpent gently beat her thigh; then the music becoming still it fell off\nagain.\n\nTaanach came back to her; and after arranging two candelabra, the lights\nof which burned in crystal balls filled with water, she tinged the\ninside of her hands with Lawsonia, spread vermilion upon her cheeks, and\nantimony along the edge of her eyelids, and lengthened her eyebrows with\na mixture of gum, musk, ebony, and crushed legs of flies.\n\nSalammbo seated on a chair with ivory uprights, gave herself up to the\nattentions of the slave. But the touchings, the odour of the aromatics,\nand the fasts that she had undergone, were enervating her. She became so\npale that Taanach stopped.\n\n\"Go on!\" said Salammbo, and bearing up against herself, she suddenly\nrevived. Then she was seized with impatience; she urged Taanach to make\nhaste, and the old slave grumbled:\n\n\"Well! well! Mistress!--Besides, you have no one waiting for you!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Salammbo, \"some one is waiting for me.\"\n\nTaanach drew back in surprise, and in order to learn more about it,\nsaid:\n\n\"What orders to you give me, Mistress? for if you are to remain away--\"\n\nBut Salammbo was sobbing; the slave exclaimed:\n\n\"You are suffering! what is the matter? Do not go away! take me! When\nyou were quite little and used to cry, I took you to my heart and\nmade you laugh with the points of my breasts; you have drained them,\nMistress!\" She struck herself upon her dried-up bosom. \"Now I am old! I\ncan do nothing for you! you no longer love me! you hide your griefs from\nme, you despise the nurse!\" And tears of tenderness and vexation flowed\ndown her cheeks in the gashes of her tattooing.\n\n\"No!\" said Salammbo, \"no, I love you! be comforted!\"\n\nWith a smile like the grimace of an old ape, Taanach resumed her task.\nIn accordance with Schahabarim's recommendations, Salammbo had ordered\nthe slave to make her magnificent; and she was obeying her mistress with\nbarbaric taste full at once of refinement and ingenuity.\n\nOver a first delicate and vinous-coloured tunic she passed a second\nembroidered with birds' feathers. Golden scales clung to her hips,\nand from this broad girdle descended her blue flowing silver-starred\ntrousers. Next Taanach put upon her a long robe made of the cloth of the\ncountry of Seres, white and streaked with green lines. On the edge of\nher shoulder she fastened a square of purple weighted at the hem with\ngrains of sandastrum; and above all these garments she placed a black\nmantle with a flowing train; then she gazed at her, and proud of her\nwork could not help saying:\n\n\"You will not be more beautiful on the day of your bridal!\"\n\n\"My bridal!\" repeated Salammbo; she was musing with her elbow resting\nupon the ivory chair.\n\nBut Taanach set up before her a copper mirror, which was so broad and\nhigh that she could see herself completely in it. Then she rose, and\nwith a light touch of her finger raised a lock of her hair which was\nfalling too low.\n\nHer hair was covered with gold dust, was crisped in front, and hung down\nbehind over her back in long twists ending in pearls. The brightness\nof the candelabra heightened the paint on her cheeks, the gold on her\ngarments, and the whiteness of her skin; around her waist, and on her\narms, hands and toes, she had such a wealth of gems that the mirror sent\nback rays upon her like a sun;--and Salammbo, standing by the side of\nTaanach, who leaned over to see her, smiled amid this dazzling display.\n\nThen she walked to and fro embarrassed by the time that was still left.\n\nSuddenly the crow of a cock resounded. She quickly pinned a long yellow\nveil upon her hair, passed a scarf around her neck, thrust her feet into\nblue leather boots, and said to Taanach:\n\n\"Go and see whether there is not a man with two horses beneath the\nmyrtles.\"\n\nTaanach had scarcely re-entered when she was descending the galley\nstaircase.\n\n\"Mistress!\" cried the nurse.\n\nSalammbo turned round with one finger on her mouth as a sign for\ndiscretion and immobility.\n\nTaanach stole softly along the prows to the foot of the terrace,\nand from a distance she could distinguish by the light of the moon a\ngigantic shadow walking obliquely in the cypress avenue to the left of\nSalammbo, a sign which presaged death.\n\nTaanach went up again into the chamber. She threw herself upon the\nground tearing her face with her nails; she plucked out her hair, and\nuttered piercing shrieks with all her might.\n\nIt occurred to her that they might be heard; then she became silent,\nsobbing quite softly with her head in the hands and her face on the\npavement.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIN THE TENT\n\nThe man who guided Salammbo made her ascend again beyond the pharos\nin the direction of the Catacombs, and then go down the long suburb of\nMolouya, which was full of steep lanes. The sky was beginning to grow\ngrey. Sometimes palm-wood beams jutting out from the walls obliged them\nto bend their heads. The two horses which were at the walk would often\nslip; and thus they reached the Teveste gate.\n\nIts heavy leaves were half open; they passed through, and it closed\nbehind them.\n\nAt first they followed the foot of the ramparts for a time, and at the\nheight of the cisterns they took their way along the Taenia, a narrow\nstrip of yellow earth separating the gulf from the lake and extending as\nfar as Rhades.\n\nNo one was to be seen around Carthage, whether on the sea or in the\ncountry. The slate-coloured waves chopped softly, and the light wind\nblowing their foam hither and thither spotted them with white rents.\nIn spite of all her veils, Salammbo shivered in the freshness of the\nmorning; the motion and the open air dazed her. Then the sun rose; it\npreyed on the back of her head, and she involuntarily dozed a little.\nThe two animals rambled along side by side, their feet sinking into the\nsilent sand.\n\nWhen they had passed the mountain of the Hot Springs, they went on at a\nmore rapid rate, the ground being firmer.\n\nBut although it was the season for sowing and ploughing, the fields were\nas empty as the desert as far as the eye could reach. Here and there\nwere scattered heaps of corn; at other places the barley was shedding\nits reddened ears. The villages showed black upon the clear horizon,\nwith shapes incoherently carved.\n\nFrom time to time a half-calcined piece of wall would be found standing\non the edge of the road. The roofs of the cottages were falling in, and\nin the interiors might be distinguished fragments of pottery, rags of\nclothing, and all kinds of unrecognisable utensils and broken things.\nOften a creature clothed in tatters, with earthy face and flaming eyes\nwould emerge from these ruins. But he would very quickly begin to run or\nwould disappear into a hole. Salammbo and her guide did not stop.\n\nDeserted plains succeeded one another. Charcoal dust which was raised by\ntheir feet behind them, stretched in unequal trails over large spaces\nof perfectly white soil. Sometimes they came upon little peaceful spots,\nwhere a brook flowed amid the long grass; and as they ascended the other\nbank Salammbo would pluck damp leaves to cool her hands. At the corner\nof a wood of rose-bays her horse shied violently at the corpse of a man\nwhich lay extended on the ground.\n\nThe slave immediately settled her again on the cushions. He was one of\nthe servants of the Temple, a man whom Schahabarim used to employ on\nperilous missions.\n\nWith extreme precaution he now went on foot beside her and between the\nhorses; he would whip the animals with the end of a leathern lace wound\nround his arm, or would perhaps take balls made of wheat, dates, and\nyolks of eggs wrapped in lotus leaves from a scrip hanging against his\nbreast, and offer them to Salammbo without speaking, and running all the\ntime.\n\nIn the middle of the day three Barbarians clad in animals' skins crossed\ntheir path. By degrees others appeared wandering in troops of ten,\ntwelve, or twenty-five men; many were driving goats or a limping cow.\nTheir heavy sticks bristled with brass points; cutlasses gleamed in\ntheir clothes, which were savagely dirty, and they opened their eyes\nwith a look of menace and amazement. As they passed some sent them a\nvulgar benediction; others obscene jests, and Schahabarim's man replied\nto each in his own idiom. He told them that this was a sick youth going\nto be cured at a distant temple.\n\nHowever, the day was closing in. Barkings were heard, and they\napproached them.\n\nThen in the twilight they perceived an enclosure of dry stones shutting\nin a rambling edifice. A dog was running along the top of the wall. The\nslave threw some pebbles at him and they entered a lofty vaulted hall.\n\nA woman was crouching in the centre warming herself at a fire of\nbrushwood, the smoke of which escaped through the holes in the ceiling.\nShe was half hidden by her white hair which fell to her knees; and\nunwilling to answer, she muttered with idiotic look words of vengeance\nagainst the Barbarians and the Carthaginians.\n\nThe runner ferreted right and left. Then he returned to her and demanded\nsomething to eat. The old woman shook her head, and murmured with her\neyes fixed upon the charcoal:\n\n\"I was the hand. The ten fingers are cut off. The mouth eats no more.\"\n\nThe slave showed her a handful of gold pieces. She rushed upon them, but\nsoon resumed her immobility.\n\nAt last he placed a dagger which he had in his girdle beneath her\nthroat. Then, trembling, she went and raised a large stone, and brought\nback an amphora of wine with fish from Hippo-Zarytus preserved in honey.\n\nSalammbo turned away from this unclean food, and fell asleep on the\nhorses' caparisons which were spread in a corner of the hall.\n\nHe awoke her before daylight.\n\nThe dog was howling. The slave went up to it quietly, and struck off\nits head with a single blow of his dagger. Then he rubbed the horses'\nnostrils with blood to revive them. The old woman cast a malediction at\nhim from behind. Salammbo perceived this, and pressed the amulet which\nshe wore above her heart.\n\nThey resumed their journey.\n\nFrom time to time she asked whether they would not arrive soon. The road\nundulated over little hills. Nothing was to be heard but the grating of\nthe grasshoppers. The sun heated the yellowed grass; the ground was all\nchinked with crevices which in dividing formed, as it were, monstrous\npaving-stones. Sometimes a viper passed, or eagles flew by; the slave\nstill continued running. Salammbo mused beneath her veils, and in spite\nof the heat did not lay them aside through fear of soiling her beautiful\ngarments.\n\nAt regular distances stood towers built by the Carthaginians for the\npurpose of keeping watch upon the tribes. They entered these for the\nsake of the shade, and then set out again.\n\nFor prudence sake they had made a wide detour the day before. But they\nmet with no one just now; the region being a sterile one, the Barbarians\nhad not passed that way.\n\nGradually the devastation began again. Sometimes a piece of mosaic would\nbe displayed in the centre of a field, the sole remnant of a vanished\nmansion; and the leafless olive trees looked at a distance like large\nbushes of thorns. They passed through a town in which houses were burnt\nto the ground. Human skeletons might be seen along the walls. There were\nsome, too, of dromedaries and mules. Half-gnawed carrion blocked the\nstreets.\n\nNight fell. The sky was lowering and cloudy.\n\nThey ascended again for two hours in a westerly direction, when suddenly\nthey perceived a quantity of little flames before them.\n\nThese were shining at the bottom of an ampitheatre. Gold plates, as they\ndisplaced one another, glanced here and there. These were the cuirasses\nof the Clinabarians in the Punic camp; then in the neighbourhood they\ndistinguished other and more numerous lights, for the armies of the\nMercenaries, now blended together, extended over a great space.\n\nSalammbo made a movement as though to advance. But Schahabarim's man\ntook her further away, and they passed along by the terrace which\nenclosed the camp of the Barbarians. A breach became visible in it, and\nthe slave disappeared.\n\nA sentry was walking upon the top of the entrenchment with a bow in his\nhand and a pike on his shoulder.\n\nSalammbo drew still nearer; the Barbarian knelt and a long arrow pierced\nthe hem of her cloak. Then as she stood motionless and shrieking, he\nasked her what she wanted.\n\n\"To speak to Matho,\" she replied. \"I am a fugitive from Carthage.\"\n\nHe gave a whistle, which was repeated at intervals further away.\n\nSalammbo waited; her frightened horse moved round and round, sniffing.\n\nWhen Matho arrived the moon was rising behind her. But she had a yellow\nveil with black flowers over her face, and so many draperies about her\nperson, that it was impossible to make any guess about her. From the top\nof the terrace he gazed upon this vague form standing up like a phantom\nin the penumbrae of the evening.\n\nAt last she said to him:\n\n\"Lead me to your tent! I wish it!\"\n\nA recollection which he could not define passed through his memory. He\nfelt his heart beating. The air of command intimidated him.\n\n\"Follow me!\" he said.\n\nThe barrier was lowered, and immediately she was in the camp of the\nBarbarians.\n\nIt was filled with a great tumult and a great throng. Bright fires were\nburning beneath hanging pots; and their purpled reflections illuminating\nsome places left others completely in the dark. There was shouting and\ncalling; shackled horses formed long straight lines amid the tents; the\nlatter were round and square, of leather or of canvas; there were huts\nof reeds, and holes in the sand such as are made by dogs. Soldiers were\ncarting faggots, resting on their elbows on the ground, or wrapping\nthemselves up in mats and preparing to sleep; and Salammbo's horse\nsometimes stretched out a leg and jumped in order to pass over them.\n\nShe remembered that she had seen them before; but their beards were\nlonger now, their faces still blacker, and their voices hoarser. Matho,\nwho walked before her, waved them off with a gesture of his arm which\nraised his red mantle. Some kissed his hands; others bending their\nspines approached him to ask for orders, for he was now veritable and\nsole chief of the Barbarians; Spendius, Autaritus, and Narr' Havas had\nbecome disheartened, and he had displayed so much audacity and obstinacy\nthat all obeyed him.\n\nSalammbo followed him through the entire camp. His tent was at the end,\nthree hundred feet from Hamilcar's entrenchments.\n\nShe noticed a wide pit on the right, and it seemed to her that faces\nwere resting against the edge of it on a level with the ground, as\ndecapitated heads might have done. However, their eyes moved, and from\nthese half-opened mouths groanings escaped in the Punic tongue.\n\nTwo Negroes holding resin lights stood on both sides of the door. Matho\ndrew the canvas abruptly aside. She followed him. It was a deep tent\nwith a pole standing up in the centre. It was lighted by a large\nlamp-holder shaped like a lotus and full of a yellow oil wherein floated\nhandfuls of burning tow, and military things might be distinguished\ngleaming in the shade. A naked sword leaned against a stool by the\nside of a shield; whips of hippopotamus leather, cymbals, bells, and\nnecklaces were displayed pell-mell on baskets of esparto-grass; a\nfelt rug lay soiled with crumbs of black bread; some copper money was\ncarelessly heaped upon a round stone in a corner, and through the rents\nin the canvas the wind brought the dust from without, together with the\nsmell of the elephants, which might be heard eating and shaking their\nchains.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said Matho.\n\nShe looked slowly around her without replying; then her eyes were\narrested in the background, where something bluish and sparkling fell\nupon a bed of palm-branches.\n\nShe advanced quickly. A cry escaped her. Matho stamped his foot behind\nher.\n\n\"Who brings you here? why do you come?\"\n\n\"To take it!\" she replied, pointing to the zaimph, and with the other\nhand she tore the veils from her head. He drew back with his elbows\nbehind him, gaping, almost terrified.\n\nShe felt as if she were leaning on the might of the gods; and looking at\nhim face to face she asked him for the zaimph; she demanded it in words\nabundant and superb.\n\nMatho did not hear; he was gazing at her, and in his eyes her garments\nwere blended with her body. The clouding of the stuffs, like the\nsplendour of her skin, was something special and belonging to her alone.\nHer eyes and her diamonds sparkled; the polish of her nails continued\nthe delicacy of the stones which loaded her fingers; the two clasps of\nher tunic raised her breasts somewhat and brought them closer together,\nand he in thought lost himself in the narrow interval between them\nwhence there fell a thread holding a plate of emeralds which could be\nseen lower down beneath the violet gauze. She had as earrings two little\nsapphire scales, each supporting a hollow pearl filled with liquid\nscent. A little drop would fall every moment through the holes in the\npearl and moisten her naked shoulder. Matho watched it fall.\n\nHe was carried away by ungovernable curiosity; and, like a child laying\nhis hand upon a strange fruit, he tremblingly and lightly touched\nthe top of her chest with the tip of his finger: the flesh, which was\nsomewhat cold, yielded with an elastic resistance.\n\nThis contact, though scarcely a sensible one, shook Matho to the very\ndepths of his nature. An uprising of his whole being urged him towards\nher. He would fain have enveloped her, absorbed her, drunk her. His\nbosom was panting, his teeth were chattering.\n\nTaking her by the wrists he drew her gently to him, and then sat down\nupon a cuirass beside the palm-tree bed which was covered with a lion's\nskin. She was standing. He looked up at her, holding her thus between\nhis knees, and repeating:\n\n\"How beautiful you are! how beautiful you are!\"\n\nHis eyes, which were continually fixed upon hers, pained her; and the\nuncomfortableness, the repugnance increased in so acute a fashion that\nSalammbo put a constraint upon herself not to cry out. The thought of\nSchahabarim came back to her, and she resigned herself.\n\nMatho still kept her little hands in his own; and from time to time,\nin spite of the priest's command, she turned away her face and tried to\nthrust him off by jerking her arms. He opened his nostrils the better\nto breathe in the perfume which exhaled from her person. It was a fresh,\nindefinable emanation, which nevertheless made him dizzy, like the smoke\nfrom a perfuming-pan. She smelt of honey, pepper, incense, roses, with\nanother odour still.\n\nBut how was she thus with him in his tent, and at his disposal? Some one\nno doubt had urged her. She had not come for the zaimph. His arms fell,\nand he bent his head whelmed in sudden reverie.\n\nTo soften him Salammbo said to him in a plaintive voice:\n\n\"What have I done to you that you should desire my death?\"\n\n\"Your death!\"\n\nShe resumed:\n\n\"I saw you one evening by the light of my burning gardens amid fuming\ncups and my slaughtered slaves, and your anger was so strong that you\nbounded towards me and I was obliged to fly! Then terror entered into\nCarthage. There were cries of the devastation of the towns, the burning\nof the country-seats, the massacre of the soldiery; it was you who had\nruined them, it was you who had murdered them! I hate you! Your very\nname gnaws me like remorse! You are execrated more than the plague, and\nthe Roman war! The provinces shudder at your fury, the furrows are full\nof corpses! I have followed the traces of your fires as though I were\ntravelling behind Moloch!\"\n\nMatho leaped up; his heart was swelling with colossal pride; he was\nraised to the stature of a god.\n\nWith quivering nostrils and clenched teeth she went on:\n\n\"As if your sacrilege were not enough, you came to me in my sleep\ncovered with the zaimph! Your words I did not understand; but I could\nsee that you wished to drag me to some terrible thing at the bottom of\nan abyss.\"\n\nMatho, writhing his arms, exclaimed:\n\n\"No! no! it was to give it to you! to restore it to you! It seemed to me\nthat the goddess had left her garment for you, and that it belonged to\nyou! In her temple or in your house, what does it matter? are you not\nall-powerful, immaculate, radiant and beautiful even as Tanith?\" And\nwith a look of boundless adoration he added:\n\n\"Unless perhaps you are Tanith?\"\n\n\"I, Tanith!\" said Salammbo to herself.\n\nThey left off speaking. The thunder rolled in the distance. Some sheep\nbleated, frightened by the storm.\n\n\"Oh! come near!\" he went on, \"come near! fear nothing!\n\n\"Formerly I was only a soldier mingled with the common herd of the\nMercenaries, ay, and so meek that I used to carry wood on my back for\nthe others. Do I trouble myself about Carthage! The crowd of its people\nmove as though lost in the dust of your sandals, and all its treasures,\nwith the provinces, fleets, and islands, do not raise my envy like the\nfreshness of your lips and the turn of your shoulders. But I wanted to\nthrow down its walls that I might reach you to possess you! Moreover,\nI was revenging myself in the meantime! At present I crush men like\nshells, and I throw myself upon phalanxes; I put aside the sarissae with\nmy hands, I check the stallions by the nostrils; a catapult would\nnot kill me! Oh! if you knew how I think of you in the midst of war!\nSometimes the memory of a gesture or of a fold of your garment suddenly\nseizes me and entwines me like a net! I perceive your eyes in the flames\nof the phalaricas and on the gilding of the shields! I hear your voice\nin the sounding of the cymbals. I turn aside, but you are not there! and\nI plunge again into the battle!\"\n\nHe raised his arms whereon his veins crossed one another like ivy on\nthe branches of a tree. Sweat flowed down his breast between his square\nmuscles; and his breathing shook his sides with his bronze girdle all\ngarnished with thongs hanging down to his knees, which were firmer than\nmarble. Salammbo, who was accustomed to eunuchs, yielded to amazement at\nthe strength of this man. It was the chastisement of the goddess or the\ninfluence of Moloch in motion around her in the five armies. She was\noverwhelmed with lassitude; and she listened in a state of stupor to the\nintermittent shouts of the sentinels as they answered one another.\n\nThe flames of the lamp kindled in the squalls of hot air. There came\nat times broad lightning flashes; then the darkness increased; and she\ncould only see Matho's eyeballs like two coals in the night. However,\nshe felt that a fatality was surrounding her, that she had reached a\nsupreme and irrevocable moment, and making an effort she went up again\ntowards the zaimph and raised her hands to seize it.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" exclaimed Matho.\n\n\"I am going back to Carthage,\" she placidly replied.\n\nHe advanced folding his arms and with so terrible a look that her heels\nwere immediately nailed, as it were, to the spot.\n\n\"Going back to Carthage!\" He stammered, and, grinding his teeth,\nrepeated:\n\n\"Going back to Carthage! Ah! you came to take the zaimph, to conquer me,\nand then disappear! No, no! you belong to me! and no one now shall tear\nyou from here! Oh! I have not forgotten the insolence of your large\ntranquil eyes, and how you crushed me with the haughtiness of your\nbeauty! 'Tis my turn now! You are my captive, my slave, my servant!\nCall, if you like, on your father and his army, the Ancients, the\nrich, and your whole accursed people! I am the master of three hundred\nthousand soldiers! I will go and seek them in Lusitania, in the Gauls,\nand in the depths of the desert, and I will overthrow your town and burn\nall its temples; the triremes shall float on the waves of blood! I will\nnot have a house, a stone, or a palm tree remaining! And if men fail me\nI will draw the bears from the mountains and urge on the lions! Seek not\nto fly or I kill you!\"\n\nPale and with clenched fists he quivered like a harp whose strings are\nabout to burst. Suddenly sobs stifled him, and he sank down upon his\nhams.\n\n\"Ah! forgive me! I am a scoundrel, and viler than scorpions, than mire\nand dust! Just now while you were speaking your breath passed across my\nface, and I rejoiced like a dying man who drinks lying flat on the edge\nof a stream. Crush me, if only I feel your feet! curse me, if only I\nhear your voice! Do not go! have pity! I love you! I love you!\"\n\nHe was on his knees on the ground before her; and he encircled her form\nwith both his arms, his head thrown back, and his hands wandering; the\ngold discs hanging from his ears gleamed upon his bronzed neck; big\ntears rolled in his eyes like silver globes; he sighed caressingly, and\nmurmured vague words lighter than a breeze and sweet as a kiss.\n\nSalammbo was invaded by a weakness in which she lost all consciousness\nof herself. Something at once inward and lofty, a command from the gods,\nobliged her to yield herself; clouds uplifted her, and she fell back\nswooning upon the bed amid the lion's hair. The zaimph fell, and\nenveloped her; she could see Matho's face bending down above her breast.\n\n\"Moloch, thou burnest me!\" and the soldier's kisses, more devouring than\nflames, covered her; she was as though swept away in a hurricane, taken\nin the might of the sun.\n\nHe kissed all her fingers, her arms, her feet, and the long tresses of\nher hair from one end to the other.\n\n\"Carry it off,\" he said, \"what do I care? take me away with it! I\nabandon the army! I renounce everything! Beyond Gades, twenty days'\njourney into the sea, you come to an island covered with gold dust,\nverdure, and birds. On the mountains large flowers filled with smoking\nperfumes rock like eternal censers; in the citron trees, which are\nhigher than cedars, milk-coloured serpents cause the fruit to fall upon\nthe turf with the diamonds in their jaws; the air is so mild that it\nkeeps you from dying. Oh! I shall find it, you will see. We shall live\nin crystal grottoes cut out at the foot of the hills. No one dwells in\nit yet, or I shall become the king of the country.\"\n\nHe brushed the dust off her cothurni; he wanted her to put a quarter of\na pomegranate between her lips; he heaped up garments behind her head to\nmake a cushion for her. He sought for means to serve her, and to humble\nhimself, and he even spread the zaimph over her feet as if it were a\nmere rug.\n\n\"Have you still,\" he said, \"those little gazelle's horns on which your\nnecklaces hang? You will give them to me! I love them!\" For he spoke\nas if the war were finished, and joyful laughs broke from him. The\nMercenaries, Hamilcar, every obstacle had now disappeared. The moon was\ngliding between two clouds. They could see it through an opening in the\ntent. \"Ah, what nights have I spent gazing at her! she seemed to me like\na veil that hid your face; you would look at me through her; the memory\nof you was mingled with her beams; then I could no longer distinguish\nyou!\" And with his head between her breasts he wept copiously.\n\n\"And this,\" she thought, \"is the formidable man who makes Carthage\ntremble!\"\n\nHe fell asleep. Then disengaging herself from his arm she put one foot\nto the ground, and she perceived that her chainlet was broken.\n\nThe maidens of the great families were accustomed to respect these\nshackles as something that was almost religious, and Salammbo, blushing,\nrolled the two pieces of the golden chain around her ankles.\n\nCarthage, Megara, her house, her room, and the country that she had\npassed through, whirled in tumultuous yet distinct images through her\nmemory. But an abyss had yawned and thrown them far back to an infinite\ndistance from her.\n\nThe storm was departing; drops of water splashing rarely, one by one,\nmade the tent-roof shake.\n\nMatho slept like a drunken man, stretched on his side, and with one arm\nover the edge of the couch. His band of pearls was raised somewhat, and\nuncovered his brow; his teeth were parted in a smile; they shone through\nhis black beard, and there was a silent and almost outrageous gaiety in\nhis half-closed eyelids.\n\nSalammbo looked at him motionless, her head bent and her hands crossed.\n\nA dagger was displayed on the table of cypress-wood at the head of the\nbed; the sight of the gleaming blade fired her with a sanguinary desire.\nMournful voices lingered at a distance in the shade, and like a chorus\nof geniuses urged her on. She approached it; she seized the steel by the\nhandle. At the rustling of her dress Matho half opened his eyes, putting\nforth his mouth upon her hands, and the dagger fell.\n\nShouts arose; a terrible light flashed behind the canvas. Matho raised\nthe latter; they perceived the camp of the Libyans enveloped in great\nflames.\n\nTheir reed huts were burning, and the twisting stems burst in the smoke\nand flew off like arrows; black shadows ran about distractedly on the\nred horizon. They could hear the shrieks of those who were in the\nhuts; the elephants, oxen, and horses plunged in the midst of the crowd\ncrushing it together with the stores and baggage that were being rescued\nfrom the fire. Trumpets sounded. There were calls of \"Matho! Matho!\"\nSome people at the door tried to get in.\n\n\"Come along! Hamilcar is burning the camp of Autaritus!\"\n\nHe made a spring. She found herself quite alone.\n\nThen she examined the zaimph; and when she had viewed it well she was\nsurprised that she had not the happiness which she had once imagined to\nherself. She stood with melancholy before her accomplished dream.\n\nBut the lower part of the tent was raised, and a monstrous form\nappeared. Salammbo could at first distinguish only the two eyes and\na long white beard which hung down to the ground; for the rest of the\nbody, which was cumbered with the rags of a tawny garment, trailed along\nthe earth; and with every forward movement the hands passed into the\nbeard and then fell again. Crawling in this way it reached her feet, and\nSalammbo recognised the aged Gisco.\n\nIn fact, the Mercenaries had broken the legs of the captive Ancients\nwith a brass bar to prevent them from taking to flight; and they were\nall rotting pell-mell in a pit in the midst of filth. But the sturdiest\nof them raised themselves and shouted when they heard the noise of\nplatters, and it was in this way that Gisco had seen Salammbo. He\nhad guessed that she was a Carthaginian woman by the little balls of\nsandastrum flapping against her cothurni; and having a presentiment\nof an important mystery he had succeeded, with the assistance of his\ncompanions, in getting out of the pit; then with elbows and hands he\nhad dragged himself twenty paces further on as far as Matho's tent. Two\nvoices were speaking within it. He had listened outside and had heard\neverything.\n\n\"It is you!\" she said at last, almost terrified.\n\n\"Yes, it is I!\" he replied, raising himself on his wrists. \"They think\nme dead, do they not?\"\n\nShe bent her head. He resumed:\n\n\"Ah! why have the Baals not granted me this mercy!\" He approached\nso close he was touching her. \"They would have spared me the pain of\ncursing you!\"\n\nSalammbo sprang quickly back, so much afraid was she of this unclean\nbeing, who was as hideous as a larva and nearly as terrible as a\nphantom.\n\n\"I am nearly one hundred years old,\" he said. \"I have seen Agathocles; I\nhave seen Regulus and the eagles of the Romans passing over the harvests\nof the Punic fields! I have seen all the terrors of battles and the\nsea encumbered with the wrecks of our fleets! Barbarians whom I used\nto command have chained my four limbs like a slave that has committed\nmurder. My companions are dying around me, one after the other; the\nodour of their corpses awakes me in the night; I drive away the birds\nthat come to peck out their eyes; and yet not for a single day have I\ndespaired of Carthage! Though I had seen all the armies of the earth\nagainst her, and the flames of the siege overtop the height of the\ntemples, I should have still believed in her eternity! But now all is\nover! all is lost! The gods execrate her! A curse upon you who have\nquickened her ruin by your disgrace!\"\n\nShe opened her lips.\n\n\"Ah! I was there!\" he cried. \"I heard you gurgling with love like a\nprostitute; then he told you of his desire, and you allowed him to kiss\nyour hands! But if the frenzy of your unchastity urged you to it, you\nshould at least have done as do the fallow deer, which hide themselves\nin their copulations, and not have displayed your shame beneath your\nfather's very eyes!\"\n\n\"What?\" she said.\n\n\"Ah! you did not know that the two entrenchments are sixty cubits from\neach other and that your Matho, in the excess of his pride, has posted\nhimself just in front of Hamilcar. Your father is there behind you; and\ncould I climb the path which leads to the platform, I should cry to him:\n'Come and see your daughter in the Barbarian's arms! She has put on the\ngarment of the goddess to please him; and in yielding her body to him\nshe surrenders with the glory of your name the majesty of the gods, the\nvengeance of her country, even the safety of Carthage!'\" The motion of\nhis toothless mouth moved his beard throughout its length; his eyes were\nriveted upon her and devoured her; panting in the dust he repeated:\n\n\"Ah! sacrilegious one! May you be accursed! accursed! accursed!\"\n\nSalammbo had drawn back the canvas; she held it raised at arm's length,\nand without answering him she looked in the direction of Hamilcar.\n\n\"It is this way, is it not?\" she said.\n\n\"What matters it to you? Turn away! Begone! Rather crush your face\nagainst the earth! It is a holy spot which would be polluted by your\ngaze!\"\n\nShe threw the zaimph about her waist, and quickly picked up her veils,\nmantle, and scarf. \"I hasten thither!\" she cried; and making her escape\nSalammbo disappeared.\n\nAt first she walked through the darkness without meeting any one, for\nall were betaking themselves to the fire; the uproar was increasing and\ngreat flames purpled the sky behind; a long terrace stopped her.\n\nShe turned round to right and left at random, seeking for a ladder,\na rope, a stone, something in short to assist her. She was afraid of\nGisco, and it seemed to her that shouts and footsteps were pursuing her.\nDay was beginning to break. She perceived a path in the thickness of the\nentrenchment. She took the hem of her robe, which impeded her, in her\nteeth, and in three bounds she was on the platform.\n\nA sonorous shout burst forth beneath her in the shade, the same which\nshe had heard at the foot of the galley staircase, and leaning over she\nrecognised Schahabarim's man with his coupled horses.\n\nHe had wandered all night between the two entrenchments; then disquieted\nby the fire, he had gone back again trying to see what was passing in\nMatho's camp; and, knowing that this spot was nearest to his tent, he\nhad not stirred from it, in obedience to the priest's command.\n\nHe stood up on one of the horses. Salammbo let herself slide down to\nhim; and they fled at full gallop, circling the Punic camp in search of\na gate.\n\nMatho had re-entered his tent. The smoky lamp gave but little light, and\nhe also believed that Salammbo was asleep. Then he delicately touched\nthe lion's skin on the palm-tree bed. He called but she did not answer;\nhe quickly tore away a strip of the canvas to let in some light; the\nzaimph was gone.\n\nThe earth trembled beneath thronging feet. Shouts, neighings, and\nclashing of armour rose in the air, and clarion flourishes sounded\nthe charge. It was as though a hurricane were whirling around him.\nImmoderate frenzy made him leap upon his arms, and he dashed outside.\n\nThe long files of the Barbarians were descending the mountain at a\nrun, and the Punic squares were advancing against them with a heavy\nand regular oscillation. The mist, rent by the rays of the sun, formed\nlittle rocking clouds which as they rose gradually discovered standards,\nhelmets, and points of pikes. Beneath the rapid evolutions portions of\nthe earth which were still in the shadow seemed to be displaced bodily;\nin other places it looked as if huge torrents were crossing one\nanother, while thorny masses stood motionless between them. Matho could\ndistinguish the captains, soldiers, heralds, and even the serving-men,\nwho were mounted on asses in the rear. But instead of maintaining\nhis position in order to cover the foot-soldiers, Narr' Havas turned\nabruptly to the right, as though he wished himself to be crushed by\nHamilcar.\n\nHis horsemen outstripped the elephants, which were slackening their\nspeed; and all the horses, stretching out their unbridled heads,\ngalloped at so furious a rate that their bellies seemed to graze the\nearth. Then suddenly Narr' Havas went resolutely up to a sentry. He\nthrew away his sword, lance, and javelins, and disappeared among the\nCarthaginians.\n\nThe king of the Numidians reached Hamilcar's tent, and pointing to his\nmen, who were standing still at a distance, he said:\n\n\"Barca! I bring them to you. They are yours.\"\n\nThen he prostrated himself in token of bondage, and to prove his\nfidelity recalled all his conduct from the beginning of the war.\n\nFirst, he had prevented the siege of Carthage and the massacre of the\ncaptives; then he had taken no advantage of the victory over Hanno after\nthe defeat at Utica. As to the Tyrian towns, they were on the frontiers\nof his kingdom. Finally he had not taken part in the battle of the\nMacaras; and he had even expressly absented himself in order to evade\nthe obligation of fighting against the Suffet.\n\nNarr' Havas had in fact wished to aggrandise himself by encroachments\nupon the Punic provinces, and had alternately assisted and forsaken\nthe Mercenaries according to the chances of victory. But seeing that\nHamilcar would ultimately prove the stronger, he had gone over to him;\nand in his desertion there was perhaps something of a grudge against\nMatho, whether on account of the command or of his former love.\n\nThe Suffet listened without interrupting him. The man who thus presented\nhimself with an army where vengeance was his due was not an auxiliary to\nbe despised; Hamilcar at once divined the utility of such an alliance in\nhis great projects. With the Numidians he would get rid of the Libyans.\nThen he would draw off the West to the conquest of Iberia; and, without\nasking Narr' Havas why he had not come sooner, or noticing any of his\nlies, he kissed him, striking his breast thrice against his own.\n\nIt was to bring matters to an end and in despair that he had fired the\ncamp of the Libyans. This army came to him like a relief from the gods;\ndissembling his joy he replied:\n\n\"May the Baals favour you! I do not know what the Republic will do for\nyou, but Hamilcar is not ungrateful.\"\n\nThe tumult increased; some captains entered. He was arming himself as he\nspoke.\n\n\"Come, return! You will use your horsemen to beat down their infantry\nbetween your elephants and mine. Courage! exterminate them!\"\n\nAnd Narr' Havas was rushing away when Salammbo appeared.\n\nShe leaped down quickly from her horse. She opened her ample cloak and\nspreading out her arms displayed the zaimph.\n\nThe leathern tent, which was raised at the corners, left visible the\nentire circuit of the mountain with its thronging soldiers, and as\nit was in the centre Salammbo could be seen on all sides. An immense\nshouting burst forth, a long cry of triumph and hope. Those who were\nmarching stopped; the dying leaned on their elbows and turned round\nto bless her. All the Barbarians knew now that she had recovered the\nzaimph; they saw her or believed that they saw her from a distance; and\nother cries, but those of rage and vengeance, resounded in spite of the\nplaudits of the Carthaginians. Thus did the five armies in tiers upon\nthe mountain stamp and shriek around Salammbo.\n\nHamilcar, who was unable to speak, nodded her his thanks. His eyes were\ndirected alternately upon the zaimph and upon her, and he noticed that\nher chainlet was broken. Then he shivered, being seized with a terrible\nsuspicion. But soon recovering his impassibility he looked sideways at\nNarr' Havas without turning his face.\n\nThe king of the Numidians held himself apart in a discreet attitude;\non his forehead he bore a little of the dust which he had touched when\nprostrating himself. At last the Suffet advanced towards him with a look\nfull of gravity.\n\n\"As a reward for the services which you have rendered me, Narr' Havas, I\ngive you my daughter. Be my son,\" he added, \"and defend your father!\"\n\nNarr' Havas gave a great gesture of surprise; then he threw himself upon\nHamilcar's hands and covered them with kisses.\n\nSalammbo, calm as a statue, did not seem to understand. She blushed a\nlittle as she cast down her eyelids, and her long curved lashes made\nshadows upon her cheeks.\n\nHamilcar wished to unite them immediately in indissoluble betrothal. A\nlance was placed in Salammbo's hands and by her offered to Narr' Havas;\ntheir thumbs were tied together with a thong of ox-leather; then corn\nwas poured upon their heads, and the grains that fell around them rang\nlike rebounding hail.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE AQUEDUCT\n\nTwelve hours afterwards all that remained of the Mercenaries was a heap\nof wounded, dead, and dying.\n\nHamilcar had suddenly emerged from the bottom of the gorge, and again\ndescended the western slope that looked towards Hippo-Zarytus, and\nthe space being broader at this spot he had taken care to draw the\nBarbarians into it. Narr' Havas had encompassed them with his horse; the\nSuffet meanwhile drove them back and crushed them. Then, too, they were\nconquered beforehand by the loss of the zaimph; even those who\ncared nothing about it had experienced anguish and something akin to\nenfeeblement. Hamilcar, not indulging his pride by holding the field of\nbattle, had retired a little further off on the left to some heights,\nfrom which he commanded them.\n\nThe shape of the camps could be recognised by their sloping palisades.\nA long heap of black cinders was smoking on the side of the Libyans;\nthe devastated soil showed undulations like the sea, and the tents with\ntheir tattered canvas looked like dim ships half lost in the breakers.\nCuirasses, forks, clarions, pieces of wood, iron and brass, corn, straw,\nand garments were scattered about among the corpses; here and there a\nphalarica on the point of extinction burned against a heap of baggage;\nin some places the earth was hidden with shields; horses' carcasses\nsucceeded one another like a series of hillocks; legs, sandals, arms,\nand coats of mail were to be seen, with heads held in their helmets by\nthe chin-pieces and rolling about like balls; heads of hair were hanging\non the thorns; elephants were lying with their towers in pools of blood,\nwith entrails exposed, and gasping. The foot trod on slimy things, and\nthere were swamps of mud although no rain had fallen.\n\nThis confusion of dead bodies covered the whole mountain from top to\nbottom.\n\nThose who survived stirred as little as the dead. Squatting in unequal\ngroups they looked at one another scared and without speaking.\n\nThe lake of Hippo-Zarytus shone at the end of a long meadow beneath\nthe setting sun. To the right an agglomeration of white houses extended\nbeyond a girdle of walls; then the sea spread out indefinitely; and the\nBarbarians, with their chins in their hands, sighed as they thought of\ntheir native lands. A cloud of grey dust was falling.\n\nThe evening wind blew; then every breast dilated, and as the freshness\nincreased, the vermin might be seen to forsake the dead, who were colder\nnow, and to run over the hot sand. Crows, looking towards the dying,\nrested motionless on the tops of the big stones.\n\nWhen night had fallen yellow-haired dogs, those unclean beasts which\nfollowed the armies, came quite softly into the midst of the Barbarians.\nAt first they licked the clots of blood on the still tepid stumps; and\nsoon they began to devour the corpses, biting into the stomachs first of\nall.\n\nThe fugitives reappeared one by one like shadows; the women also\nventured to return, for there were still some of them left, especially\namong the Libyans, in spite of the dreadful massacre of them by the\nNumidians.\n\nSome took ropes' ends and lighted them to use as torches. Others held\ncrossed pikes. The corpses were placed upon these and were conveyed\napart.\n\nThey were found lying stretched in long lines, on their backs, with\ntheir mouths open, and their lances beside them; or else they were piled\nup pell-mell so that it was often necessary to dig out a whole heap\nin order to discover those they were wanting. Then the torch would be\npassed slowly over their faces. They had received complicated wounds\nfrom hideous weapons. Greenish strips hung from their foreheads; they\nwere cut in pieces, crushed to the marrow, blue from strangulation, or\nbroadly cleft by the elephants' ivory. Although they had died at almost\nthe same time there existed differences between their various states of\ncorruption. The men of the North were puffed up with livid swellings,\nwhile the more nervous Africans looked as though they had been smoked,\nand were already drying up. The Mercenaries might be recognised by the\ntattooing on their hands: the old soldiers of Antiochus displayed\na sparrow-hawk; those who had served in Egypt, the head of the\ncynosephalus; those who had served with the princes of Asia, a hatchet,\na pomegranate, or a hammer; those who had served in the Greek republics,\nthe side-view of a citadel or the name of an archon; and some were to\nbe seen whose arms were entirely covered with these multiplied symbols,\nwhich mingled with their scars and their recent wounds.\n\nFour great funeral piles were erected for the men of Latin race, the\nSamnites, Etruscans, Campanians, and Bruttians.\n\nThe Greeks dug pits with the points of their swords. The Spartans\nremoved their red cloaks and wrapped them round the dead; the Athenians\nlaid them out with their faces towards the rising sun; the Cantabrians\nburied them beneath a heap of pebbles; the Nasamonians bent them double\nwith ox-leather thongs, and the Garamantians went and interred them on\nthe shore so that they might be perpetually washed by the waves. But the\nLatins were grieved that they could not collect the ashes in urns; the\nNomads regretted the heat of the sands in which bodies were mummified,\nand the Celts, the three rude stones beneath a rainy sky at the end of\nan islet-covered gulf.\n\nVociferations arose, followed by the lengthened silence. This was to\noblige the souls to return. Then the shouting was resumed persistently\nat regular intervals.\n\nThey made excuses to the dead for their inability to honour them as the\nrites prescribed: for, owing to this deprivation, they would pass for\ninfinite periods through all kinds of chances and metamorphoses; they\nquestioned them and asked them what they desired; others loaded them\nwith abuse for having allowed themselves to be conquered.\n\nThe bloodless faces lying back here and there on wrecks of armour showed\npale in the light of the great funeral-pile; tears provoked tears, the\nsobs became shriller, the recognitions and embracings more frantic.\nWomen stretched themselves on the corpses, mouth to mouth and brow to\nbrow; it was necessary to beat them in order to make them withdraw when\nthe earth was being thrown in. They blackened their cheeks; they cut off\ntheir hair; they drew their own blood and poured it into the pits; they\ngashed themselves in imitation of the wounds that disfigured the dead.\nRoarings burst forth through the crashings of the cymbals. Some snatched\noff their amulets and spat upon them. The dying rolled in the bloody\nmire biting their mutilated fists in their rage; and forty-three\nSamnites, quite a \"sacred spring,\" cut one another's throats like\ngladiators. Soon wood for the funeral-piles failed, the flames were\nextinguished, every spot was occupied; and weary from shouting,\nweakened, tottering, they fell asleep close to their dead brethren,\nthose who still clung to life full of anxieties, and the others desiring\nnever to wake again.\n\nIn the greyness of the dawn some soldiers appeared on the outskirts of\nthe Barbarians, and filed past with their helmets raised on the points\nof their pikes; they saluted the Mercenaries and asked them whether they\nhad no messages to send to their native lands.\n\nOthers approached, and the Barbarians recognised some of their former\ncompanions.\n\nThe Suffet had proposed to all the captives that they should serve in\nhis troops. Several had fearlessly refused; and quite resolved neither\nto support them nor to abandon them to the Great Council, he had sent\nthem away with injunctions to fight no more against Carthage. As to\nthose who had been rendered docile by the fear of tortures, they had\nbeen furnished with the weapons taken from the enemy; and they were now\npresenting themselves to the vanquished, not so much in order to seduce\nthem as out of an impulse of pride and curiosity.\n\nAt first they told of the good treatment which they had received from\nthe Suffet; the Barbarians listened to them with jealousy although they\ndespised them. Then at the first words of reproach the cowards fell\ninto a passion; they showed them from a distance their own swords\nand cuirasses and invited them with abuse to come and take them. The\nBarbarians picked up flints; all took to flight; and nothing more could\nbe seen on the summit of the mountain except the lance-points projecting\nabove the edge of the palisades.\n\nThen the Barbarians were overwhelmed with a grief that was heavier than\nthe humiliation of the defeat. They thought of the emptiness of their\ncourage, and they stood with their eyes fixed and grinding their teeth.\n\nThe same thought came to them all. They rushed tumultuously upon the\nCarthaginian prisoners. It chanced that the Suffet's soldiers had been\nunable to discover them, and as he had withdrawn from the field of\nbattle they were still in the deep pit.\n\nThey were ranged on the ground on a flattened spot. Sentries formed a\ncircle round them, and the women were allowed to enter thirty or forty\nat a time. Wishing to profit by the short time that was allowed to them,\nthey ran from one to the other, uncertain and panting; then bending over\nthe poor bodies they struck them with all their might like washerwomen\nbeating linen; shrieking their husband's names they tore them with their\nnails and put out their eyes with the bodkins of their hair. The men\ncame next and tortured them from their feet, which they cut off at the\nankles, to their foreheads, from which they took crowns of skin to put\nupon their own heads. The Eaters of Uncleanness were atrocious in their\ndevices. They envenomed the wounds by pouring into them dust, vinegar,\nand fragments of pottery; others waited behind; blood flowed, and they\nrejoiced like vintagers round fuming vats.\n\nMatho, however, was seated on the ground, at the very place where he had\nhappened to be when the battle ended, his elbows on his knees, and his\ntemples in his hands; he saw nothing, heard nothing, and had ceased to\nthink.\n\nAt the shrieks of joy uttered by the crowd he raised his head. Before\nhim a strip of canvas caught on a flagpole, and trailing on the ground,\nsheltered in confused fashion blankets, carpets, and a lion's skin. He\nrecognised his tent; and he riveted his eyes upon the ground as though\nHamilcar's daughter, when she disappeared, had sunk into the earth.\n\nThe torn canvas flapped in the wind; the long rags of it sometimes\npassed across his mouth, and he perceived a red mark like the print of a\nhand. It was the hand of Narr' Havas, the token of their alliance. Then\nMatho rose. He took a firebrand which was still smoking, and threw\nit disdainfully upon the wrecks of his tent. Then with the toe of his\ncothurn he pushed the things which fell out back towards the flame so\nthat nothing might be left.\n\nSuddenly, without any one being able to guess from what point he had\nsprung up, Spendius reappeared.\n\nThe former slave had fastened two fragments of a lance against his\nthigh; he limped with a piteous look, breathing forth complaints the\nwhile.\n\n\"Remove that,\" said Matho to him. \"I know that you are a brave fellow!\"\nFor he was so crushed by the injustice of the gods that he had not\nstrength enough to be indignant with men.\n\nSpendius beckoned to him and led him to a hollow of the mountain, where\nZarxas and Autaritus were lying concealed.\n\nThey had fled like the slave, the one although he was cruel, and the\nother in spite of his bravery. But who, said they, could have expected\nthe treachery of Narr' Havas, the burning of the camp of the Libyans,\nthe loss of the zaimph, the sudden attack by Hamilcar, and, above all,\nhis manoeuvres which forced them to return to the bottom of the mountain\nbeneath the instant blows of the Carthaginians? Spendius made no\nacknowledgement of his terror, and persisted in maintaining that his leg\nwas broken.\n\nAt last the three chiefs and the schalischim asked one another what\ndecision should now be adopted.\n\nHamilcar closed the road to Carthage against them; they were caught\nbetween his soldiers and the provinces belonging to Narr' Havas; the\nTyrian towns would join the conquerors; the Barbarians would find\nthemselves driven to the edge of the sea, and all those united forces\nwould crush them. This would infallibly happen.\n\nThus no means presented themselves of avoiding the war. Accordingly\nthey must prosecute it to the bitter end. But how were they to make the\nnecessity of an interminable battle understood by all these disheartened\npeople, who were still bleeding from their wounds.\n\n\"I will undertake that!\" said Spendius.\n\nTwo hours afterwards a man who came from the direction of Hippo-Zarytus\nclimbed the mountain at a run. He waved some tablets at arm's length,\nand as he shouted very loudly the Barbarians surrounded him.\n\nThe tablets had been despatched by the Greek soldiers in Sardinia. They\nrecommended their African comrades to watch over Gisco and the other\ncaptives. A Samian trader, one Hipponax, coming from Carthage, had\ninformed them that a plot was being organised to promote their escape,\nand the Barbarians were urged to take every precaution; the Republic was\npowerful.\n\nSpendius's stratagem did not succeed at first as he had hoped. This\nassurance of the new peril, so far from exciting frenzy, raised fears;\nand remembering Hamilcar's warning, lately thrown into their midst, they\nexpected something unlooked for and terrible. The night was spent in\ngreat distress; several even got rid of their weapons, so as to soften\nthe Suffet when he presented himself.\n\nBut on the following day, at the third watch, a second runner appeared,\nstill more breathless, and blackened with dust. The Greek snatched\nfrom his hand a roll of papyrus covered with Phoenician writing. The\nMercenaries were entreated not to be disheartened; the brave men of\nTunis were coming with large reinforcements.\n\nSpendius first read the letter three times in succession; and held up by\ntwo Cappadocians, who bore him seated on their shoulders, he had\nhimself conveyed from place to place and re-read it. For seven hours he\nharangued.\n\nHe reminded the Mercenaries of the promises of the Great Council; the\nAfricans of the cruelties of the stewards, and all the Barbarians of the\ninjustice of Carthage. The Suffet's mildness was only a bait to capture\nthem; those who surrendered would be sold as slaves, and the vanquished\nwould perish under torture. As to flight, what routes could they follow?\nNot a nation would receive them. Whereas by continuing their efforts\nthey would obtain at once freedom, vengeance, and money! And they would\nnot have long to wait, since the people of Tunis, the whole of Libya,\nwas rushing to relieve them. He showed the unrolled papyrus: \"Look at\nit! read! see their promises! I do not lie.\"\n\nDogs were straying about with their black muzzles all plastered with\nred. The men's uncovered heads were growing hot in the burning sun.\nA nauseous smell exhaled from the badly buried corpses. Some even\nprojected from the earth as far as the waist. Spendius called them to\nwitness what he was saying; then he raised his fists in the direction of\nHamilcar.\n\nMatho, moreover, was watching him, and to cover his cowardice he\ndisplayed an anger by which he gradually found himself carried away.\nDevoting himself to the gods he heaped curses upon the Carthaginians.\nThe torture of the captives was child's play. Why spare them, and be\never dragging this useless cattle after one? \"No! we must put an end to\nit! their designs are known! a single one might ruin us! no pity! Those\nwho are worthy will be known by the speed of their legs and the force of\ntheir blows.\"\n\nThen they turned again upon the captives. Several were still in the last\nthroes; they were finished by the thrust of a heel in the mouth or a\nstab with the point of a javelin.\n\nThen they thought of Gisco. Nowhere could he be seen; they were\ndisturbed with anxiety. They wished at once to convince themselves of\nhis death and to participate in it. At last three Samnite shepherds\ndiscovered him at a distance of fifteen paces from the spot where\nMatho's tent lately stood. They recognised him by his long beard and\nthey called the rest.\n\nStretched on his back, his arms against his hips, and his knees close\ntogether, he looked like a dead man laid out for the tomb. Nevertheless\nhis wasted sides rose and fell, and his eyes, wide-opened in his pallid\nface, gazed in a continuous and intolerable fashion.\n\nThe Barbarians looked at him at first with great astonishment. Since he\nhad been living in the pit he had been almost forgotten; rendered uneasy\nby old memories they stood at a distance and did not venture to raise\ntheir hands against him.\n\nBut those who were behind were murmuring and pressed forward when a\nGaramantian passed through the crowd; he was brandishing a sickle; all\nunderstood his thought; their faces purpled, and smitten with shame they\nshrieked:\n\n\"Yes! yes!\"\n\nThe man with the curved steel approached Gisco. He took his head, and,\nresting it upon his knee, sawed it off with rapid strokes; it fell; to\ngreat jets of blood made a hole in the dust. Zarxas leaped upon it, and\nlighter than a leopard ran towards the Carthaginians.\n\nThen when he had covered two thirds of the mountain he drew Gisco's\nhead from his breast by the beard, whirled his arm rapidly several\ntimes,--and the mass, when thrown at last, described a long parabola and\ndisappeared behind the Punic entrenchments.\n\nSoon at the edge of the palisades there rose two crossed standards, the\ncustomary sign for claiming a corpse.\n\nThen four heralds, chosen for their width of chest, went out with great\nclarions, and speaking through the brass tubes declared that henceforth\nthere would be between Carthaginians and Barbarians neither faith, pity,\nnor gods, that they refused all overtures beforehand, and that envoys\nwould be sent back with their hands cut off.\n\nImmediately afterwards, Spendius was sent to Hippo-Zarytus to procure\nprovisions; the Tyrian city sent them some the same evening. They ate\ngreedily. Then when they were strengthened they speedily collected\nthe remains of their baggage and their broken arms; the women massed\nthemselves in the centre, and heedless of the wounded left weeping\nbehind them, they set out along the edge of the shore like a herd of\nwolves taking its departure.\n\nThey were marching upon Hippo-Zarytus, resolved to take it, for they had\nneed of a town.\n\nHamilcar, as he perceived them at a distance, had a feeling of despair\nin spite of the pride which he experienced in seeing them fly before\nhim. He ought to have attacked them immediately with fresh troops.\nAnother similar day and the war was over! If matters were protracted\nthey would return with greater strength; the Tyrian towns would join\nthem; his clemency towards the vanquished had been of no avail. He\nresolved to be pitiless.\n\nThe same evening he sent the Great Council a dromedary laden with\nbracelets collected from the dead, and with horrible threats ordered\nanother army to be despatched.\n\nAll had for a long time believed him lost; so that on learning his\nvictory they felt a stupefaction which was almost terror. The vaguely\nannounced return of the zaimph completed the wonder. Thus the gods and\nthe might of Carthage seemed now to belong to him.\n\nNone of his enemies ventured upon complaint or recrimination. Owing to\nthe enthusiasm of some and the pusillanimity of the rest, an army of\nfive thousand men was ready before the interval prescribed had elapsed.\n\nThis army promptly made its way to Utica in order to support the\nSuffet's rear, while three thousand of the most notable citizens\nembarked in vessels which were to land them at Hippo-Zarytus, whence\nthey were to drive back the Barbarians.\n\nHanno had accepted the command; but he intrusted the army to his\nlieutenant, Magdassin, so as to lead the troops which were to be\ndisembarked himself, for he could no longer endure the shaking of\nthe litter. His disease had eaten away his lips and nostrils, and had\nhollowed out a large hole in his face; the back of his throat could be\nseen at a distance of ten paces, and he knew himself to be so hideous\nthat he wore a veil over his head like a woman.\n\nHippo-Zarytus paid no attention to his summonings nor yet to those of\nthe Barbarians; but every morning the inhabitants lowered provisions to\nthe latter in baskets, and shouting from the tops of the towers pleaded\nthe exigencies of the Republic and conjured them to withdraw. By means\nof signs they addressed the same protestations to the Carthaginians, who\nwere stationed on the sea.\n\nHanno contented himself with blockading the harbour without risking an\nattack. However, he permitted the judges of Hippo-Zarytus to admit three\nhundred soldiers. Then he departed to the Cape Grapes, and made a\nlong circuit so as to hem in the Barbarians, an inopportune and even\ndangerous operation. His jealousy prevented him from relieving the\nSuffet; he arrested his spies, impeded him in all his plans, and\ncompromised the success of the enterprise. At last Hamilcar wrote to\nthe Great Council to rid himself of Hanno, and the latter returned to\nCarthage furious at the baseness of the Ancients and the madness of his\ncolleague. Hence, after so many hopes, the situation was now still more\ndeplorable; but there was an effort not to reflect upon it and even not\nto talk about it.\n\nAs if all this were not sufficient misfortune at one time, news came\nthat the Sardinian Mercenaries had crucified their general, seized the\nstrongholds, and everywhere slaughtered those of Chanaanitish race. The\nRoman people threatened the Republic with immediate hostilities\nunless she gave twelve hundred talents with the whole of the island of\nSardinia. They had accepted the alliance of the Barbarians, and they\ndespatched to them flat-bottomed boats laden with meal and dried meat.\nThe Carthaginians pursued these, and captured five hundred men; but\nthree days afterwards a fleet coming from Byzacena, and conveying\nprovisions to Carthage, foundered in a storm. The gods were evidently\ndeclaring against her.\n\nUpon this the citizens of Hippo-Zarytus, under pretence of an alarm,\nmade Hanno's three hundred men ascend their walls; then coming behind\nthem they took them by the legs, and suddenly threw them over the\nramparts. Some who were not killed were pursued, and went and drowned\nthemselves in the sea.\n\nUtica was enduring the presence of soldiers, for Magdassin had acted\nlike Hanno, and in accordance with his orders and deaf to Hamilcar's\nprayers, was surrounding the town. As for these, they were given wine\nmixed with mandrake, and were then slaughtered in their sleep. At the\nsame time the Barbarians arrived; Magdassin fled; the gates were opened,\nand thenceforward the two Tyrian towns displayed an obstinate devotion\nto their new friends and an inconceivable hatred to their former allies.\n\nThis abandonment of the Punic cause was a counsel and a precedent. Hopes\nof deliverance revived. Populations hitherto uncertain hesitated no\nlonger. Everywhere there was a stir. The Suffet learnt this, and he had\nno assistance to look for! He was now irrevocably lost.\n\nHe immediately dismissed Narr' Havas, who was to guard the borders of\nhis kingdom. As for himself, he resolved to re-enter Carthage in order\nto obtain soldiers and begin the war again.\n\nThe Barbarians posted at Hippo-Zarytus perceived his army as it\ndescended the mountain.\n\nWhere could the Carthaginians be going? Hunger, no doubt, was urging\nthem on; and, distracted by their sufferings, they were coming in spite\nof their weakness to give battle. But they turned to the right: they\nwere fleeing. They might be overtaken and all be crushed. The Barbarians\ndashed in pursuit of them.\n\nThe Carthaginians were checked by the river. It was wide this time and\nthe west wind had not been blowing. Some crossed by swimming, and the\nrest on their shields. They resumed their march. Night fell. They were\nout of sight.\n\nThe Barbarians did not stop; they went higher to find a narrower place.\nThe people of Tunis hastened thither, bringing those of Utica along with\nthem. Their numbers increased at every bush; and the Carthaginians, as\nthey lay on the ground, could hear the tramping of their feet in the\ndarkness. From time to time Barca had a volley of arrows discharged\nbehind him to check them, and several were killed. When day broke they\nwere in the Ariana Mountains, at the spot where the road makes a bend.\n\nThen Matho, who was marching at the head, thought that he could\ndistinguish something green on the horizon on the summit of an eminence.\nThen the ground sank, and obelisks, domes, and houses appeared! It was\nCarthage. He leaned against a tree to keep himself from falling, so\nrapidly did his heart beat.\n\nHe thought of all that had come to pass in his existence since the\nlast time that he had passed that way! It was an infinite surprise, it\nstunned him. Then he was transported with joy at the thought of seeing\nSalammbo again. The reasons which he had for execrating her returned to\nhis recollection, but he very quickly rejected them. Quivering and with\nstraining eyeballs he gazed at the lofty terrace of a palace above the\npalm trees beyond Eschmoun; a smile of ecstasy lighted his face as if\nsome great light had reached him; he opened his arms, and sent kisses on\nthe breeze, and murmured: \"Come! come!\" A sigh swelled his breast, and\ntwo long tears like pearls fell upon his beard.\n\n\"What stays you?\" cried Spendius. \"Make haste! Forward! The Suffet is\ngoing to escape us! But your knees are tottering, and you are looking at\nme like a drunken man!\"\n\nHe stamped with impatience and urged Matho, his eyes twinkling as at the\napproach of an object long aimed at.\n\n\"Ah! we have reached it! We are there! I have them!\"\n\nHe had so convinced and triumphant an air that Matho was surprised from\nhis torpor, and felt himself carried away by it. These words, coming\nwhen his distress was at its height, drove his despair to vengeance, and\npointed to food for his wrath. He bounded upon one of the camels that\nwere among the baggage, snatched up its halter, and with the long\nrope, struck the stragglers with all his might, running right and left\nalternately, in the rear of the army, like a dog driving a flock.\n\nAt this thundering voice the lines of men closed up; even the lame\nhurried their steps; the intervening space lessened in the middle of the\nisthmus. The foremost of the Barbarians were marching in the dust raised\nby the Carthaginians. The two armies were coming close, and were on the\npoint of touching. But the Malqua gate, the Tagaste gate, and the great\ngate of Khamon threw wide their leaves. The Punic square divided; three\ncolumns were swallowed up, and eddied beneath the porches. Soon the\nmass, being too tightly packed, could advance no further; pikes clashed\nin the air, and the arrows of the Barbarians were shivering against the\nwalls.\n\nHamilcar was to be seen on the threshold of Khamon. He turned round\nand shouted to his men to move aside. He dismounted from his horse; and\npricking it on the croup with the sword which he held, sent it against\nthe Barbarians.\n\nIt was a black stallion, which was fed on balls of meal, and would bend\nits knees to allow its master to mount. Why was he sending it away? Was\nthis a sacrifice?\n\nThe noble horse galloped into the midst of the lances, knocked down men,\nand, entangling its feet in its entrails, fell down, then rose again\nwith furious leaps; and while they were moving aside, trying to stop it,\nor looking at it in surprise, the Carthaginians had united again; they\nentered, and the enormous gate shut echoing behind them.\n\nIt would not yield. The Barbarians came crushing against it;--and for\nsome minutes there was an oscillation throughout the army, which became\nweaker and weaker, and at last ceased.\n\nThe Carthaginians had placed soldiers on the aqueduct, they began to\nhurl stones, balls, and beams. Spendius represented that it would be\nbest not to persist. The Barbarians went and posted themselves further\noff, all being quite resolved to lay siege to Carthage.\n\nThe rumour of the war, however, had passed beyond the confines of\nthe Punic empire; and from the pillars of Hercules to beyond Cyrene\nshepherds mused on it as they kept their flocks, and caravans talked\nabout it in the light of the stars. This great Carthage, mistress of the\nseas, splendid as the sun, and terrible as a god, actually found men\nwho were daring enough to attack her! Her fall even had been asserted\nseveral times; and all had believed it for all wished it: the subject\npopulations, the tributary villages, the allied provinces, the\nindependent hordes, those who execrated her for her tyranny or were\njealous of her power, or coveted her wealth. The bravest had very\nspeedily joined the Mercenaries. The defeat at the Macaras had checked\nall the rest. At last they had recovered confidence, had gradually\nadvanced and approached; and now the men of the eastern regions were\nlying on the sandhills of Clypea on the other side of the gulf. As soon\nas they perceived the Barbarians they showed themselves.\n\nThey were not Libyans from the neighbourhood of Carthage, who had long\ncomposed the third army, but nomads from the tableland of Barca, bandits\nfrom Cape Phiscus and the promontory of Dernah, from Phazzana and\nMarmarica. They had crossed the desert, drinking at the brackish wells\nwalled in with camels' bones; the Zuaeces, with their covering of\nostrich feathers, had come on quadrigae; the Garamantians, masked with\nblack veils, rode behind on their painted mares; others were mounted on\nasses, onagers, zebras, and buffaloes; while some dragged after them the\nroofs of their sloop-shaped huts together with their families and\nidols. There were Ammonians with limbs wrinkled by the hot water of the\nsprings; Atarantians, who curse the sun; Troglodytes, who bury their\ndead with laughter beneath branches of trees; and the hideous Auseans,\nwho eat grass-hoppers; the Achyrmachidae, who eat lice; and the\nvermilion-painted Gysantians, who eat apes.\n\nAll were ranged along the edge of the sea in a great straight line.\nAfterwards they advanced like tornadoes of sand raised by the wind. In\nthe centre of the isthmus the throng stopped, the Mercenaries who were\nposted in front of them, close to the walls, being unwilling to move.\n\nThen from the direction of Ariana appeared the men of the West,\nthe people of the Numidians. In fact, Narr' Havas governed only the\nMassylians; and, moreover, as they were permitted by custom to abandon\ntheir king when reverses were sustained, they had assembled on the\nZainus, and then had crossed it at Hamilcar's first movement. First were\nseen running up all the hunters from Malethut-Baal and Garaphos, clad\nin lions' skins, and with the staves of their pikes driving small lean\nhorses with long manes; then marched the Gaetulians in cuirasses of\nserpents' skin; then the Pharusians, wearing lofty crowns made of wax\nand resin; and the Caunians, Macarians, and Tillabarians, each holding\ntwo javelins and a round shield of hippopotamus leather. They stopped at\nthe foot of the Catacombs among the first pools of the Lagoon.\n\nBut when the Libyans had moved away, the multitude of the Negroes\nappeared like a cloud on a level with the ground, in the place which the\nothers had occupied. They were there from the White Harousch, the Black\nHarousch, the desert of Augila, and even from the great country of\nAgazymba, which is four months' journey south of the Garamantians, and\nfrom regions further still! In spite of their red wooden jewels, the\nfilth of their black skin made them look like mulberries that had been\nlong rolling in the dust. They had bark-thread drawers, dried-grass\ntunics, fallow-deer muzzles on their heads; they shook rods furnished\nwith rings, and brandished cows' tails at the end of sticks, after the\nfashion of standards, howling the while like wolves.\n\nThen behind the Numidians, Marusians, and Gaetulians pressed the\nyellowish men, who are spread through the cedar forests beyond Taggir.\nThey had cat-skin quivers flapping against their shoulders, and they led\nin leashes enormous dogs, which were as high as asses, and did not bark.\n\nFinally, as though Africa had not been sufficiently emptied, and it had\nbeen necessary to seek further fury in the very dregs of the races, men\nmight be seen behind the rest, with beast-like profiles and grinning\nwith idiotic laughter--wretches ravaged by hideous diseases, deformed\npigmies, mulattoes of doubtful sex, albinos whose red eyes blinked in\nthe sun; stammering out unintelligible sounds, they put a finger into\ntheir mouths to show that they were hungry.\n\nThe confusion of weapons was as great as that of garments and peoples.\nThere was not a deadly invention that was not present--from wooden\ndaggers, stone hatchets and ivory tridents, to long sabres toothed\nlike saws, slender, and formed of a yielding copper blade. They handled\ncutlasses which were forked into several branches like antelopes' horns,\nbills fastened to the ends of ropes, iron triangles, clubs and bodkins.\nThe Ethiopians from the Bambotus had little poisoned darts hidden in\ntheir hair. Many had brought pebbles in bags. Others, empty handed,\nchattered with their teeth.\n\nThis multitude was stirred with a ceaseless swell. Dromedaries, smeared\nall over with tar-like streaks, knocked down the women, who carried\ntheir children on their hips. The provisions in the baskets were pouring\nout; in walking, pieces of salt, parcels of gum, rotten dates, and\ngourou nuts were crushed underfoot; and sometimes on vermin-covered\nbosoms there would hang a slender cord supporting a diamond that the\nSatraps had sought, an almost fabulous stone, sufficient to purchase\nan empire. Most of them did not even know what they desired. They were\nimpelled by fascination or curiosity; and nomads who had never seen a\ntown were frightened by the shadows of the walls.\n\nThe isthmus was now hidden by men; and this long surface, whereon the\ntents were like huts amid an inundation, stretched as far as the first\nlines of the other Barbarians, which were streaming with steel and were\nposted symmetrically upon both sides of the aqueduct.\n\nThe Carthaginians had not recovered from the terror caused by their\narrival when they perceived the siege-engines sent by the Tyrian towns\ncoming straight towards them like monsters and like buildings--with\ntheir masts, arms, ropes, articulations, capitals and carapaces, sixty\ncarroballistas, eighty onagers, thirty scorpions, fifty tollenos, twelve\nrams, and three gigantic catapults which hurled pieces of rock of the\nweight of fifteen talents. Masses of men clinging to their bases pushed\nthem on; at every step a quivering shook them, and in this way they\narrived in front of the walls.\n\nBut several days were still needed to finish the preparations for\nthe siege. The Mercenaries, taught by their defeats, would not risk\nthemselves in useless engagements; and on both sides there was no haste,\nfor it was well known that a terrible action was about to open, and that\nthe result of it would be complete victory or complete extermination.\n\nCarthage might hold out for a long time; her broad walls presented a\nseries of re-entrant and projecting angles, an advantageous arrangement\nfor repelling assaults.\n\nNevertheless a portion had fallen down in the direction of the\nCatacombs, and on dark nights lights could be seen in the dens of Malqua\nthrough the disjointed blocks. These in some places overlooked the top\nof the ramparts. It was here that the Mercenaries' wives, who had been\ndriven away by Matho, were living with their new husbands. On seeing the\nmen again their hearts could stand it no longer. They waved their scarfs\nat a distance; then they came and chatted in the darkness with the\nsoldiers through the cleft in the wall, and one morning the Great\nCouncil learned that they had all fled. Some had passed through between\nthe stones; others with greater intrepidity had let themselves down with\nropes.\n\nAt last Spendius resolved to accomplish his design.\n\nThe war, by keeping him at a distance, had hitherto prevented him;\nand since the return to before Carthage, it seemed to him that the\ninhabitants suspected his enterprise. But soon they diminished the\nsentries on the aqueduct. There were not too many people for the defence\nof the walls.\n\nThe former slave practised himself for some days in shooting arrows at\nthe flamingoes on the lake. Then one moonlight evening he begged Matho\nto light a great fire of straw in the middle of the night, while all his\nmen were to shout at the same time; and taking Zarxas with him, he went\naway along the edge of the gulf in the direction of Tunis.\n\nWhen on a level with the last arches they returned straight towards the\naqueduct; the place was unprotected: they crawled to the base of the\npillars.\n\nThe sentries on the platform were walking quietly up and down.\n\nTowering flames appeared; clarions rang; and the soldiers on vedette,\nbelieving that there was an assault, rushed away in the direction of\nCarthage.\n\nOne man had remained. He showed black against the background of the\nsky. The moon was shining behind him, and his shadow, which was of\nextravagant size, looked in the distance like an obelisk proceeding\nacross the plain.\n\nThey waited until he was in position just before them. Zarxas seized his\nsling, but whether from prudence or from ferocity Spendius stopped him.\n\"No, the whiz of the bullet would make a noise! Let me!\"\n\nThen he bent his bow with all his strength, resting the lower end of it\nagainst the great toe of his left foot; he took aim, and the arrow went\noff.\n\nThe man did not fall. He disappeared.\n\n\"If he were wounded we should hear him!\" said Spendius; and he mounted\nquickly from story to story as he had done the first time, with the\nassistance of a rope and a harpoon. Then when he had reached the top and\nwas beside the corpse, he let it fall again. The Balearian fastened a\npick and a mallet to it and turned back.\n\nThe trumpets sounded no longer. All was now quiet. Spendius had raised\none of the flag-stones and, entering the water, had closed it behind\nhim.\n\nCalculating the distance by the number of his steps, he arrived at the\nexact spot where he had noticed an oblique fissure; and for three hours\nuntil morning he worked in continuous and furious fashion, breathing\nwith difficulty through the interstices in the upper flag-tones,\nassailed with anguish, and twenty times believing that he was going\nto die. At last a crack was heard, and a huge stone ricocheting on the\nlower arches rolled to the ground,--and suddenly a cataract, an entire\nriver, fell from the skies onto the plain. The aqueduct, being cut\nthrough in the centre, was emptying itself. It was death to Carthage and\nvictory for the Barbarians.\n\nIn an instant the awakened Carthaginians appeared on the walls, the\nhouses, and the temples. The Barbarians pressed forward with shouts.\nThey danced in delirium around the great waterfall, and came up and wet\ntheir heads in it in the extravagance of their joy.\n\nA man in a torn, brown tunic was perceived on the summit of the\naqueduct. He stood leaning over the very edge with both hands on his\nhips, and was looking down below him as though astonished at his work.\n\nThen he drew himself up. He surveyed the horizon with a haughty air\nwhich seemed to say: \"All that is now mine!\" The applause of the\nBarbarians burst forth, while the Carthaginians, comprehending their\ndisaster at last, shrieked with despair. Then he began to run about\nthe platform from one end to the other,--and like a chariot-driver\ntriumphant at the Olympic Games, Spendius, distraught with pride, raised\nhis arms aloft.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nMOLOCH\n\nThe Barbarians had no need of a circumvallation on the side of Africa,\nfor it was theirs. But to facilitate the approach to the walls, the\nentrenchments bordering the ditch were thrown down. Matho next divided\nthe army into great semicircles so as to encompass Carthage the better.\nThe hoplites of the Mercenaries were placed in the first rank, and\nbehind them the slingers and horsemen; quite at the back were the\nbaggage, chariots, and horses; and the engines bristled in front of this\nthrong at a distance of three hundred paces from the towers.\n\nAmid the infinite variety of their nomenclature (which changed several\ntimes in the course of the centuries) these machines might be reduced to\ntwo systems: some acted like slings, and the rest like bows.\n\nThe first, which were the catapults, was composed of a square frame with\ntwo vertical uprights and a horizontal bar. In its anterior portion was\na cylinder, furnished with cables, which held back a great beam bearing\na spoon for the reception of projectiles; its base was caught in a\nskein of twisted thread, and when the ropes were let go it sprang up and\nstruck against the bar, which, checking it with a shock, multiplied its\npower.\n\nThe second presented a more complicated mechanism. A cross-bar had its\ncentre fixed on a little pillar, and from this point of junction there\nbranched off at right angles a short of channel; two caps containing\ntwists of horse-hair stood at the extremities of the cross-bar; two\nsmall beams were fastened to them to hold the extremities of a rope\nwhich was brought to the bottom of the channel upon a tablet of bronze.\nThis metal plate was released by a spring, and sliding in grooves\nimpelled the arrows.\n\nThe catapults were likewise called onagers, after the wild asses which\nfling up stones with their feet, and the ballistas scorpions, on account\nof a hook which stood upon the tablet, and being lowered by a blow of\nthe fist, released the spring.\n\nTheir construction required learned calculations; the wood selected had\nto be of the hardest substance, and their gearing all of brass; they\nwere stretched with levers, tackle-blocks, capstans or tympanums; the\ndirection of the shooting was changed by means of strong pivots; they\nwere moved forward on cylinders, and the most considerable of them,\nwhich were brought piece by piece, were set up in front of the enemy.\n\nSpendius arranged three great catapults opposite the three principle\nangles; he placed a ram before every gate, a ballista before every\ntower, while carroballistas were to move about in the rear. But it was\nnecessary to protect them against the fire thrown by the besieged, and\nfirst of all to fill up the trench which separated them from the walls.\n\nThey pushed forward galleries formed of hurdles of green reeds, and\noaken semicircles like enormous shields gliding on three wheels; the\nworkers were sheltered in little huts covered with raw hides and stuffed\nwith wrack; the catapults and ballistas were protected by rope curtains\nwhich had been steeped in vinegar to render them incombustible. The\nwomen and children went to procure stones on the strand, and gathered\nearth with their hands and brought it to the soldiers.\n\nThe Carthaginians also made preparations.\n\nHamilcar had speedily reassured them by declaring that there was enough\nwater left in the cisterns for one hundred and twenty-three days. This\nassertion, together with his presence, and above all that of the zaimph\namong them, gave them good hopes. Carthage recovered from its dejection;\nthose who were not of Chanaanitish origin were carried away by the\npassion of the rest.\n\nThe slaves were armed, the arsenals were emptied, and every citizen had\nhis own post and his own employment. Twelve hundred of the fugitives\nhad survived, and the Suffet made them all captains; and carpenters,\narmourers, blacksmiths, and goldsmiths were intrusted with the engines.\nThe Carthaginians had kept a few in spite of the conditions of the peace\nwith Rome. These were repaired. They understood such work.\n\nThe two northern and eastern sides, being protected by the sea and the\ngulf, remained inaccessible. On the wall fronting the Barbarians they\ncollected tree-trunks, mill-stones, vases filled with sulphur, and\nvats filled with oil, and built furnaces. Stones were heaped up on the\nplatforms of the towers, and the houses bordering immediately on the\nrampart were crammed with sand in order to strengthen it and increase\nits thickness.\n\nThe Barbarians grew angry at the sight of these preparations. They\nwished to fight at once. The weights which they put into the catapults\nwere so extravagantly heavy that the beams broke, and the attack was\ndelayed.\n\nAt last on the thirteenth day of the month of Schabar,--at sunrise,--a\ngreat blow was heard at the gate of Khamon.\n\nSeventy-five soldiers were pulling at ropes arranged at the base of a\ngigantic beam which was suspended horizontally by chains hanging from\na framework, and which terminated in a ram's head of pure brass. It had\nbeen swathed in ox-hides; it was bound at intervals with iron bracelets;\nit was thrice as thick as a man's body, one hundred and twenty cubits\nlong, and under the crowd of naked arms pushing it forward and drawing\nit back, it moved to and fro with a regular oscillation.\n\nThe other rams before the other gates began to be in motion. Men\nmight be seen mounting from step to step in the hollow wheels of the\ntympanums. The pulleys and caps grated, the rope curtains were lowered,\nand showers of stones and showers of arrows poured forth simultaneously;\nall the scattered slingers ran up. Some approached the rampart hiding\npots of resin under their shields; then they would hurl these with all\ntheir might. This hail of bullets, darts, and flames passed above the\nfirst ranks in the form of a curve which fell behind the walls. But\nlong cranes, used for masting vessels, were reared on the summit of the\nramparts; and from them there descended some of those enormous pincers\nwhich terminated in two semicircles toothed on the inside. They bit the\nrams. The soldiers clung to the beam and drew it back. The Carthaginians\nhauled in order to pull it up; and the action was prolonged until the\nevening.\n\nWhen the Mercenaries resumed their task on the following day, the tops\nof the walls were completely carpeted with bales of cotton, sails, and\ncushions; the battlements were stopped up with mats; and a line of forks\nand blades, fixed upon sticks, might be distinguished among the cranes\non the rampart. A furious resistance immediately began.\n\nTrunks of trees fastened to cables fell and rose alternately and\nbattered the rams; cramps hurled by the ballistas tore away the roofs of\nthe huts; and streams of flints and pebbles poured from the platforms of\nthe towers.\n\nAt last the rams broke the gates of Khamon and Tagaste. But the\nCarthaginians had piled up such an abundance of materials on the inside\nthat the leaves did not open. They remained standing.\n\nThen they drove augers against the walls; these were applied to the\njoints of the blocks, so as to detach the latter. The engines were\nbetter managed, the men serving them were divided into squads, and they\nwere worked from morning till evening without interruption and with the\nmonotonous precision of a weaver's loom.\n\nSpendius returned to them untiringly. It was he who stretched the skeins\nof the ballistas. In order that the twin tensions might completely\ncorrespond, the ropes as they were tightened were struck on the right\nand left alternately until both sides gave out an equal sound. Spendius\nwould mount upon the timbers. He would strike the ropes softly with\nthe extremity of his foot, and strain his ears like a musician tuning\na lyre. Then when the beam of the catapult rose, when the pillar of the\nballista trembled with the shock of the spring, when the stones were\nshooting in rays, and the darts pouring in streams, he would incline his\nwhole body and fling his arms into the air as though to follow them.\n\nThe soldiers admired his skill and executed his commands. In the gaiety\nof their work they gave utterance to jests on the names of the machines.\nThus the plyers for seizing the rams were called \"wolves,\" and the\ngalleries were covered with \"vines\"; they were lambs, or they were going\nto gather the grapes; and as they loaded their pieces they would say to\nthe onagers: \"Come, pick well!\" and to the scorpions: \"Pierce them\nto the heart!\" These jokes, which were ever the same, kept up their\ncourage.\n\nNevertheless the machines did not demolish the rampart. It was formed of\ntwo walls and was completely filled with earth. The upper portions were\nbeaten down, but each time the besieged raised them again. Matho ordered\nthe construction of wooden towers which should be as high as the towers\nof stone. They cast turf, stakes, pebbles and chariots with their wheels\ninto the trench so as to fill it up the more quickly; but before this\nwas accomplished the immense throng of the Barbarians undulated over the\nplain with a single movement and came beating against the foot of the\nwalls like an overflowing sea.\n\nThey moved forward the rope ladders, straight ladders, and sambucas,\nthe latter consisting of two poles from which a series of bamboos\nterminating in a moveable bridge were lowered by means of tackling.\nThey formed numerous straight lines resting against the wall, and the\nMercenaries mounted them in files, holding their weapons in their hands.\nNot a Carthaginian showed himself; already two thirds of the rampart\nhad been covered. Then the battlements opened, vomiting flames and smoke\nlike dragon jaws; the sand scattered and entered the joints of their\narmour; the petroleum fastened on their garments; the liquid lead\nhopped on their helmets and made holes in their flesh; a rain of sparks\nsplashed against their faces, and eyeless orbits seemed to weep tears as\nbig as almonds. There were men all yellow with oil, with their hair\nin flames. They began to run and set fire to the rest. They were\nextinguished in mantles steeped in blood, which were thrown from a\ndistance over their faces. Some who had no wounds remained motionless,\nstiffer than stakes, their mouths open and their arms outspread.\n\nThe assault was renewed for several days in succession, the Mercenaries\nhoping to triumph by extraordinary energy and audacity.\n\nSometimes a man raised on the shoulders of another would drive a\npin between the stones, and then making use of it as a step to reach\nfurther, would place a second and a third; and, protected by the edge\nof the battlements, which stood out from the wall, they would gradually\nraise themselves in this way; but on reaching a certain height they\nalways fell back again. The great trench was full to overflowing;\nthe wounded were massed pell-mell with the dead and dying beneath the\nfootsteps of the living. Calcined trunks formed black spots amid opened\nentrails, scattered brains, and pools of blood; and arms and legs\nprojecting half way out of a heap, would stand straight up like props in\na burning vineyard.\n\nThe ladders proving insufficient the tollenos were brought into\nrequisition,--instruments consisting of a long beam set transversely\nupon another, and bearing at its extremity a quadrangular basket which\nwould hold thirty foot-soldiers with their weapons.\n\nMatho wished to ascend in the first that was ready. Spendius stopped\nhim.\n\nSome men bent over a capstan; the great beam rose, became horizontal,\nreared itself almost vertically, and being overweighted at the end, bent\nlike a huge reed. The soldiers, who were crowded together, were hidden\nup to their chins; only their helmet-plumes could be seen. At last when\nit was twenty cubits high in the air it turned several times to the\nright and to the left, and then was depressed; and like a giant arm\nholding a cohort of pigmies in its hand, it laid the basketful of\nmen upon the edge of the wall. They leaped into the crowd and never\nreturned.\n\nAll the other tollenos were speedily made ready. But a hundred times\nas many would have been needed for the capture of the town. They were\nutilised in a murderous fashion: Ethiopian archers were placed in the\nbaskets; then, the cables having been fastened, they remained suspended\nand shot poisoned arrows. The fifty tollenos commanding the battlements\nthus surrounded Carthage like monstrous vultures; and the Negroes\nlaughed to see the guards on the rampart dying in grievous convulsions.\n\nHamilcar sent hoplites to these posts, and every morning made them drink\nthe juice of certain herbs which protected them against the poison.\n\nOne evening when it was dark he embarked the best of his soldiers\non lighters and planks, and turning to the right of the harbour,\ndisembarked on the Taenia. Then he advanced to the first lines of\nthe Barbarians, and taking them in flank, made a great slaughter. Men\nhanging to ropes would descend at night from the top of the wall with\ntorches in their hands, burn the works of the Mercenaries, and then\nmount up again.\n\nMatho was exasperated; every obstacle strengthened his wrath, which led\nhim into terrible extravagances. He mentally summoned Salammbo to an\ninterview; then he waited. She did not come; this seemed to him like a\nfresh piece of treachery,--and henceforth he execrated her. If he\nhad seen her corpse he would perhaps have gone away. He doubled the\noutposts, he planted forks at the foot of the rampart, he drove caltrops\ninto the ground, and he commanded the Libyans to bring him a whole\nforest that he might set it on fire and burn Carthage like a den of\nfoxes.\n\nSpendius went on obstinately with the siege. He sought to invent\nterrible machines such as had never before been constructed.\n\nThe other Barbarians, encamped at a distance on the isthmus, were amazed\nat these delays; they murmured, and they were let loose.\n\nThen they rushed with their cutlasses and javelins, and beat against\nthe gates with them. But the nakedness of their bodies facilitating the\ninfliction of wounds, the Carthaginians massacred them freely; and the\nMercenaries rejoiced at it, no doubt through jealousy about the plunder.\nHence there resulted quarrels and combats between them. Then, the\ncountry having been ravaged, provisions were soon scarce. They grew\ndisheartened. Numerous hordes went away, but the crowd was so great that\nthe loss was not apparent.\n\nThe best of them tried to dig mines, but the earth, being badly\nsupported, fell in. They began again in other places, but Hamilcar\nalways guessed the direction that they were taking by holding his ear\nagainst a bronze shield. He bored counter-mines beneath the path along\nwhich the wooden towers were to move, and when they were pushed forward\nthey sank into the holes.\n\nAt last all recognised that the town was impregnable, unless a long\nterrace was raised to the same height as the walls, so as to enable them\nto fight on the same level. The top of it should be paved so that\nthe machines might be rolled along. Then Carthage would find it quite\nimpossible to resist.\n\nThe town was beginning to suffer from thirst. The water which was worth\ntwo kesitahs the bath at the opening of the siege was now sold for\na shekel of silver; the stores of meat and corn were also becoming\nexhausted; there was a dread of famine, and some even began to speak of\nuseless mouths, which terrified every one.\n\nFrom the square of Khamon to the temple of Melkarth the streets were\ncumbered with corpses; and, as it was the end of the summer, the\ncombatants were annoyed by great black flies. Old men carried off the\nwounded, and the devout continued the fictitious funerals for their\nrelatives and friends who had died far away during the war. Waxen\nstatues with clothes and hair were displayed across the gates. They\nmelted in the heat of the tapers burning beside them; the paint flowed\ndown upon their shoulders, and tears streamed over the faces of the\nliving, as they chanted mournful songs beside them. The crowd meanwhile\nran to and fro; armed bands passed; captains shouted orders, while the\nshock of the rams beating against the rampart was constantly heard.\n\nThe temperature became so heavy that the bodies swelled and would no\nlonger fit into the coffins. They were burned in the centre of the\ncourts. But the fires, being too much confined, kindled the neighbouring\nwalls, and long flames suddenly burst from the houses like blood\nspurting from an artery. Thus Moloch was in possession of Carthage; he\nclasped the ramparts, he rolled through the streets, he devoured the\nvery corpses.\n\nMen wearing cloaks made of collected rags in token of despair, stationed\nthemselves at the corners of the cross-ways. They declaimed against the\nAncients and against Hamilcar, predicted complete ruin to the people,\nand invited them to universal destruction and license. The most\ndangerous were the henbane-drinkers; in their crisis they believed\nthemselves wild beasts, and leaped upon the passers-by to rend them.\nMobs formed around them, and the defence of Carthage was forgotten. The\nSuffet devised the payment of others to support his policy.\n\nIn order to retain the genius of the gods within the town their images\nhad been covered with chains. Black veils were placed upon the Pataec\ngods, and hair-cloths around the altars; and attempts were made to\nexcite the pride and jealousy of the Baals by singing in their ears:\n\"Thou art about to suffer thyself to be vanquished! Are the others\nperchance more strong? Show thyself! aid us! that the peoples may not\nsay: 'Where are now their gods?'\"\n\nThe colleges of the pontiffs were agitated by unceasing anxiety. Those\nof Rabbetna were especially afraid--the restoration of the zaimph having\nbeen of no avail. They kept themselves shut up in the third enclosure\nwhich was as impregnable as a fortress. Only one among them, the high\npriest Schahabarim, ventured to go out.\n\nHe used to visit Salammbo. But he would either remain perfectly silent,\ngazing at her with fixed eyeballs, or else would be lavish of words, and\nthe reproaches that he uttered were harder than ever.\n\nWith inconceivable inconsistency he could not forgive the young girl\nfor carrying out his commands; Schahabarim had guessed all, and this\nhaunting thought revived the jealousies of his impotence. He accused her\nof being the cause of the war. Matho, according to him, was besieging\nCarthage to recover the zaimph; and he poured out imprecations and\nsarcasms upon this Barbarian who pretended to the possession of holy\nthings. Yet it was not this that the priest wished to say.\n\nBut just now Salammbo felt no terror of him. The anguish which she used\nformerly to suffer had left her. A strange peacefulness possessed her.\nHer gaze was less wandering, and shone with limpid fire.\n\nMeanwhile the python had become ill again; and as Salammbo, on the\ncontrary, appeared to be recovering, old Taanach rejoiced in the\nconviction that by its decline it was taking away the languor of her\nmistress.\n\nOne morning she found it coiled up behind the bed of ox-hides, colder\nthan marble, and with its head hidden by a heap of worms. Her cries\nbrought Salammbo to the spot. She turned it over for a while with the\ntip of her sandal, and the slave was amazed at her insensibility.\n\nHamilcar's daughter no longer prolonged her fasts with so much fervour.\nShe passed whole days on the top of her terrace, leaning her elbows\nagainst the balustrade, and amusing herself by looking out before her.\nThe summits of the walls at the end of the town cut uneven zigzags upon\nthe sky, and the lances of the sentries formed what was like a border\nof corn-ears throughout their length. Further away she could see the\nmanoeuvres of the Barbarians between the towers; on days when the siege\nwas interrupted she could even distinguish their occupations. They\nmended their weapons, greased their hair, and washed their bloodstained\narms in the sea; the tents were closed; the beasts of burden were\nfeeding; and in the distance the scythes of the chariots, which were all\nranged in a semicircle, looked like a silver scimitar lying at the base\nof the mountains. Schahabarim's talk recurred to her memory. She was\nwaiting for Narr' Havas, her betrothed. In spite of her hatred she would\nhave liked to see Matho again. Of all the Carthaginians she was perhaps\nthe only one who would have spoken to him without fear.\n\nHer father often came into her room. He would sit down panting on the\ncushions, and gaze at her with an almost tender look, as if he found\nsome rest from her fatigues in the sight of her. He sometimes questioned\nher about her journey to the camp of the Mercenaries. He even asked her\nwhether any one had urged her to it; and with a shake of the head she\nanswered, No,--so proud was Salammbo of having saved the zaimph.\n\nBut the Suffet always came back to Matho under pretence of making\nmilitary inquiries. He could not understand how the hours which she had\nspent in the tent had been employed. Salammbo, in fact, said nothing\nabout Gisco; for as words had an effective power in themselves, curses,\nif reported to any one, might be turned against him; and she was silent\nabout her wish to assassinate, lest she should be blamed for not having\nyielded to it. She said that the schalischim appeared furious, that he\nhad shouted a great deal, and that he had then fallen asleep. Salammbo\ntold no more, through shame perhaps, or else because she was led by her\nextreme ingenuousness to attach but little importance to the soldier's\nkisses. Moreover, it all floated through her head in a melancholy and\nmisty fashion, like the recollection of a depressing dream; and she\nwould not have known in what way or in what words to express it.\n\nOne evening when they were thus face to face with each other, Taanach\ncame in looking quite scared. An old man with a child was yonder in the\ncourts, and wished to see the Suffet.\n\nHamilcar turned pale, and then quickly replied:\n\n\"Let him come up!\"\n\nIddibal entered without prostrating himself. He held a young boy,\ncovered with a goat's-hair cloak, by the hand, and at once raised the\nhood which screened his face.\n\n\"Here he is, Master! Take him!\"\n\nThe Suffet and the slave went into a corner of the room.\n\nThe child remained in the centre standing upright, and with a gaze\nof attention rather than of astonishment he surveyed the ceiling, the\nfurniture, the pearl necklaces trailing on the purple draperies, and the\nmajestic maiden who was bending over towards him.\n\nHe was perhaps ten years old, and was not taller than a Roman sword. His\ncurly hair shaded his swelling forehead. His eyeballs looked as if they\nwere seeking for space. The nostrils of his delicate nose were broad\nand palpitating, and upon his whole person was displayed the indefinable\nsplendour of those who are destined to great enterprises. When he had\ncast aside his extremely heavy cloak, he remained clad in a lynx skin,\nwhich was fastened about his waist, and he rested his little naked feet,\nwhich were all white with dust, resolutely upon the pavement. But he no\ndoubt divined that important matters were under discussion, for he\nstood motionless, with one hand behind his back, his chin lowered, and a\nfinger in his mouth.\n\nAt last Hamilcar attracted Salammbo with a sign and said to her in a low\nvoice:\n\n\"You will keep him with you, you understand! No one, even though\nbelonging to the house, must know of his existence!\"\n\nThen, behind the door, he again asked Iddibal whether he was quite sure\nthat they had not been noticed.\n\n\"No!\" said the slave, \"the streets were empty.\"\n\nAs the war filled all the provinces he had feared for his master's son.\nThen, not knowing where to hide him, he had come along the coasts in a\nsloop, and for three days Iddibal had been tacking about in the gulf and\nwatching the ramparts. At last, that evening, as the environs of Khamon\nseemed to be deserted, he had passed briskly through the channel and\nlanded near the arsenal, the entrance to the harbour being free.\n\nBut soon the Barbarians posted an immense raft in front of it in order\nto prevent the Carthaginians from coming out. They were again rearing\nthe wooden towers, and the terrace was rising at the same time.\n\nOutside communications were cut off and an intolerable famine set in.\n\nThe besieged killed all the dogs, all the mules, all the asses, and then\nthe fifteen elephants which the Suffet had brought back. The lions of\nthe temple of Moloch had become ferocious, and the hierodules no longer\ndurst approach them. They were fed at first with the wounded Barbarians;\nthen they were thrown corpses that were still warm; they refused\nthem, and they all died. People wandered in the twilight along the old\nenclosures, and gathered grass and flowers among the stones to boil\nthem in wine, wine being cheaper than water. Others crept as far as the\nenemy's outposts, and entered the tents to steal food, and the stupefied\nBarbarians sometimes allowed them to return. At last a day arrived when\nthe Ancients resolved to slaughter the horses of Eschmoun privately.\nThey were holy animals whose manes were plaited by the pontiffs with\ngold ribbons, and whose existence denoted the motion of the sun--the\nidea of fire in its most exalted form. Their flesh was cut into equal\nportions and buried behind the altar. Then every evening the Ancients,\nalleging some act of devotion, would go up to the temple and regale\nthemselves in secret, and each would take away a piece beneath his tunic\nfor his children. In the deserted quarters remote from the walls, the\ninhabitants, whose misery was not so great, had barricaded themselves\nthrough fear of the rest.\n\nThe stones from the catapults, and the demolitions commanded for\npurposes of defence, had accumulated heaps of ruins in the middle of\nthe streets. At the quietest times masses of people would suddenly rush\nalong with shouts; and from the top of the Acropolis the conflagrations\nwere like purple rags scattered upon the terraces and twisted by the\nwind.\n\nThe three great catapults did not stop in spite of all these works.\nTheir ravages were extraordinary: thus a man's head rebounded from the\npediment of the Syssitia; a woman who was being confined in the street\nof Kinisdo was crushed by a block of marble, and her child was carried\nwith the bed as far as the crossways of Cinasyn, where the coverlet was\nfound.\n\nThe most annoying were the bullets of the slingers. They fell upon the\nroofs, and in the gardens, and in the middle of the courts, while people\nwere at table before a slender meal with their hearts big with sighs.\nThese cruel projectiles bore engraved letters which stamped themselves\nupon the flesh;--and insults might be read on corpses such as \"pig,\"\n\"jackal,\" \"vermin,\" and sometimes jests: \"Catch it!\" or \"I have well\ndeserved it!\"\n\nThe portion of the rampart which extended from the corner of the\nharbours to the height of the cisterns was broken down. Then the people\nof Malqua found themselves caught between the old enclosure of Byrsa\nbehind, and the Barbarians in front. But there was enough to be done in\nthickening the wall and making it as high as possible without troubling\nabout them; they were abandoned; all perished; and although they were\ngenerally hated, Hamilcar came to be greatly abhorred.\n\nOn the morrow he opened the pits in which he kept stores of corn,\nand his stewards gave it to the people. For three days they gorged\nthemselves.\n\nTheir thirst, however, only became the more intolerable, and they could\nconstantly see before them the long cascade formed by the clear falling\nwater of the aqueduct. A thin vapour, with a rainbow beside it, went up\nfrom its base, beneath the rays of the sun, and a little stream curving\nthrough the plain fell into the gulf.\n\nHamilcar did not give way. He was reckoning upon an event, upon\nsomething decisive and extraordinary.\n\nHis own slaves tore off the silver plates from the temple of Melkarth;\nfour long boats were drawn out of the harbour, they were brought by\nmeans of capstans to the foot of the Mappalian quarter, the wall facing\nthe shore was bored, and they set out for the Gauls to buy Mercenaries\nthere at no matter what price. Nevertheless, Hamilcar was distressed at\nhis inability to communicate with the king of the Numidians, for he\nknew that he was behind the Barbarians, and ready to fall upon them. But\nNarr' Havas, being too weak, was not going to make any venture alone;\nand the Suffet had the rampart raised twelve palms higher, all the\nmaterial in the arsenals piled up in the Acropolis, and the machines\nrepaired once more.\n\nSinews taken from bulls' necks, or else stags' hamstrings, were commonly\nemployed for the twists of the catapults. However, neither stags nor\nbulls were in existence in Carthage. Hamilcar asked the Ancients for\nthe hair of their wives; all sacrificed it, but the quantity was not\nsufficient. In the buildings of the Syssitia there were twelve hundred\nmarriageable slaves destined for prostitution in Greece and Italy, and\ntheir hair, having been rendered elastic by the use of unguents, was\nwonderfully well adapted for engines of war. But the subsequent loss\nwould be too great. Accordingly it was decided that a choice should\nbe made of the finest heads of hair among the wives of the plebeians.\nCareless of their country's needs, they shrieked in despair when the\nservants of the Hundred came with scissors to lay hands upon them.\n\nThe Barbarians were animated with increased fury. They could be seen in\nthe distance taking fat from the dead to grease their machines, while\nothers pulled out the nails and stitched them end to end to make\ncuirasses. They devised a plan of putting into the catapults vessels\nfilled with serpents which had been brought by the Negroes; the clay\npots broke on the flag-stones, the serpents ran about, seemed to\nmultiply, and, so numerous were they, to issue naturally from the walls.\nThen the Barbarians, not satisfied with their invention, improved upon\nit; they hurled all kinds of filth, human excrements, pieces of carrion,\ncorpses. The plague reappeared. The teeth of the Carthaginians fell out\nof their mouths, and their gums were discoloured like those of camels\nafter too long a journey.\n\nThe machines were set up on the terrace, although the latter did not\nas yet reach everywhere to the height of the rampart. Before the\ntwenty-three towers on the fortification stood twenty-three others of\nwood. All the tollenos were mounted again, and in the centre, a\nlittle further back, appeared the formidable helepolis of Demetrius\nPoliorcetes, which Spendius had at last reconstructed. Of pyramidical\nshape, like the pharos of Alexandria, it was one hundred and thirty\ncubits high and twenty-three wide, with nine stories, diminishing as\nthey approached the summit, and protected by scales of brass; they were\npierced with numerous doors and were filled with soldiers, and on the\nupper platform there stood a catapult flanked by two ballistas.\n\nThen Hamilcar planted crosses for those who should speak of surrender,\nand even the women were brigaded. The people lay in the streets and\nwaited full of distress.\n\nThen one morning before sunrise (it was the seventh day of the month\nof Nyssan) they heard a great shout uttered by all the Barbarians\nsimultaneously; the leaden-tubed trumpets pealed, and the great\nPaphlagonian horns bellowed like bulls. All rose and ran to the rampart.\n\nA forest of lances, pikes, and swords bristled at its base. It leaped\nagainst the wall, the ladders grappled them; and Barbarians' heads\nappeared in the intervals of the battlements.\n\nBeams supported by long files of men were battering at the gates; and,\nin order to demolish the wall at places where the terrace was wanting,\nthe Mercenaries came up in serried cohorts, the first line crawling, the\nsecond bending their hams, and the others rising in succession to the\nlast who stood upright; while elsewhere, in order to climb up, the\ntallest advanced in front and the lowest in the rear, and all rested\ntheir shields upon their helmets with their left arms, joining them\ntogether at the edges so tightly that they might have been taken for an\nassemblage of large tortoises. The projectiles slid over these oblique\nmasses.\n\nThe Carthaginians threw down mill-stones, pestles, vats, casks, beds,\neverything that could serve as a weight and could knock down. Some\nwatched at the embrasures with fisherman's nets, and when the Barbarian\narrived he found himself caught in the meshes, and struggled like a\nfish. They demolished their own battlements; portions of wall fell down\nraising a great dust; and as the catapults on the terrace were shooting\nover against one another, the stones would strike together and shiver\ninto a thousand pieces, making a copious shower upon the combatants.\n\nSoon the two crowds formed but one great chain of human bodies; it\noverflowed into the intervals in the terrace, and, somewhat looser at\nthe two extremities, swayed perpetually without advancing. They clasped\none another, lying flat on the ground like wrestlers. They crushed one\nanother. The women leaned over the battlements and shrieked. They\nwere dragged away by their veils, and the whiteness of their suddenly\nuncovered sides shone in the arms of the Negroes as the latter buried\ntheir daggers in them. Some corpses did not fall, being too much pressed\nby the crowd, and, supported by the shoulders of their companions,\nadvanced for some minutes quite upright and with staring eyes. Some\nwho had both temples pierced by a javelin swayed their heads about like\nbears. Mouths, opened to shout, remained gaping; severed hands flew\nthrough the air. Mighty blows were dealt, which were long talked of by\nthe survivors.\n\nMeanwhile arrows darted from the towers of wood and stone. The tollenos\nmoved their long yards rapidly; and as the Barbarians had sacked the\nold cemetery of the aborigines beneath the Catacombs, they hurled the\ntombstones against the Carthaginians. Sometimes the cables broke under\nthe weight of too heavy baskets, and masses of men, all with uplifted\narms, would fall from the sky.\n\nUp to the middle of the day the veterans had attacked the Taenia\nfiercely in order to penetrate into the harbour and destroy the fleet.\nHamilcar had a fire of damp straw lit upon the roofing of Khamon, and\nas the smoke blinded them they fell back to left, and came to swell\nthe horrible rout which was pressing forward in Malqua. Some syntagmata\ncomposed of sturdy men, chosen expressly for the purpose, had broken in\nthree gates. They were checked by lofty barriers made of planks studded\nwith nails, but a fourth yielded easily; they dashed over it at a\nrun and rolled into a pit in which there were hidden snares. At the\nsouth-west gate Autaritus and his men broke down the rampart, the\nfissure in which had been stopped up with bricks. The ground behind\nrose, and they climbed it nimbly. But on the top they found a second\nwall composed of stones and long beams lying quite flat and alternating\nlike the squares on a chess-board. It was a Gaulish fashion, and had\nbeen adapted by the Suffet to the requirements of the situation; the\nGauls imagined themselves before a town in their own country. Their\nattack was weak, and they were repulsed.\n\nAll the roundway, from the street of Khamon as far as the Green Market,\nnow belonged to the Barbarians, and the Samnites were finishing off\nthe dying with blows of stakes; or else with one foot on the wall were\ngazing down at the smoking ruins beneath them, and the battle which was\nbeginning again in the distance.\n\nThe slingers, who were distributed through the rear, were still\nshooting. But the springs of the Acarnanian slings had broken from use,\nand many were throwing stones with the hand like shepherds; the rest\nhurled leaden bullets with the handle of a whip. Zarxas, his shoulders\ncovered with his long black hair, went about everywhere, and led on the\nBarbarians. Two pouches hung at his hips; he thrust his left hand\ninto them continually, while his right arm whirled round like a\nchariot-wheel.\n\nMatho had at first refrained from fighting, the better to command\nthe Barbarians all at once. He had been seen along the gulf with the\nMercenaries, near the lagoon with the Numidians, and on the shores of\nthe lake among the Negroes, and from the back part of the plain he urged\nforward masses of soldiers who came ceaselessly against the ramparts. By\ndegrees he had drawn near; the smell of blood, the sight of carnage, and\nthe tumult of clarions had at last made his heart leap. Then he had gone\nback into his tent, and throwing off his cuirass had taken his lion's\nskin as being more convenient for battle. The snout fitted upon his\nhead, bordering his face with a circle of fangs; the two fore-paws were\ncrossed upon his breast, and the claws of the hinder ones fell beneath\nhis knees.\n\nHe had kept on his strong waist-belt, wherein gleamed a two-edged axe,\nand with his great sword in both hands he had dashed impetuously through\nthe breach. Like a pruner cutting willow-branches and trying to strike\noff as much as possible so as to make the more money, he marched along\nmowing down the Carthaginians around him. Those who tried to seize him\nin flank he knocked down with blows of the pommel; when they attacked\nhim in front he ran them through; if they fled he clove them. Two men\nleaped together upon his back; he bounded backwards against a gate and\ncrushed them. His sword fell and rose. It shivered on the angle of a\nwall. Then he took his heavy axe, and front and rear he ripped up the\nCarthaginians like a flock of sheep. They scattered more and more, and\nhe was quite alone when he reached the second enclosure at the foot\nof the Acropolis. The materials which had been flung from the summit\ncumbered the steps and were heaped up higher than the wall. Matho turned\nback amid the ruins to summons his companions.\n\nHe perceived their crests scattered over the multitude; they were\nsinking and their wearers were about to perish; he dashed towards them;\nthen the vast wreath of red plumes closed in, and they soon rejoined him\nand surrounded him. But an enormous crowd was discharging from the side\nstreets. He was caught by the hips, lifted up and carried away outside\nthe ramparts to a spot where the terrace was high.\n\nMatho shouted a command and all the shields sank upon the helmets; he\nleaped upon them in order to catch hold somewhere so as to re-enter\nCarthage; and, flourishing his terrible axe, ran over the shields, which\nresembled waves of bronze, like a marine god, with brandished trident,\nover his billows.\n\nHowever, a man in a white robe was walking along the edge of the\nrampart, impassible, and indifferent to the death which surrounded him.\nSometimes he would spread out his right hand above his eyes in order\nto find out some one. Matho happened to pass beneath him. Suddenly his\neyeballs flamed, his livid face contracted; and raising both his lean\narms he shouted out abuse at him.\n\nMatho did not hear it; but he felt so furious and cruel a look entering\nhis heart that he uttered a roar. He hurled his long axe at him; some\npeople threw themselves upon Schahabarim; and Matho seeing him no more\nfell back exhausted.\n\nA terrible creaking drew near, mingled with the rhythm of hoarse voices\nsinging together.\n\nIt was the great helepolis surrounded by a crowd of soldiers. They were\ndragging it with both hands, hauling it with ropes, and pushing it with\ntheir shoulders,--for the slope rising from the plain to the terrace,\nalthough extremely gentle, was found impracticable for machines of such\nprodigious weight. However, it had eight wheels banded with iron, and it\nhad been advancing slowly in this way since the morning, like a mountain\nraised upon another. Then there appeared an immense ram issuing from its\nbase. The doors along the three fronts which faced the town fell down,\nand cuirassed soldiers appeared in the interior like pillars of iron.\nSome might be seen climbing and descending the two staircases which\ncrossed the stories. Some were waiting to dart out as soon as the cramps\nof the doors touched the walls; in the middle of the upper platform the\nskeins of the ballistas were turning, and the great beam of the catapult\nwas being lowered.\n\nHamilcar was at that moment standing upright on the roof of Melkarth. He\nhad calculated that it would come directly towards him, against what was\nthe most invulnerable place in the wall, which was for that very reason\ndenuded of sentries. His slaves had for a long time been bringing\nleathern bottles along the roundway, where they had raised with clay\ntwo transverse partitions forming a sort of basin. The water was flowing\ninsensibly along the terrace, and strange to say, it seemed to cause\nHamilcar no anxiety.\n\nBut when the helepolis was thirty paces off, he commanded planks to\nbe placed over the streets between the houses from the cisterns to\nthe rampart; and a file of people passed from hand to hand helmets and\namphoras, which were emptied continually. The Carthaginians, however,\ngrew indignant at this waste of water. The ram was demolishing the wall,\nwhen suddenly a fountain sprang forth from the disjointed stones. Then\nthe lofty brazen mass, nine stories high, which contained and engaged\nmore than three thousand soldiers, began to rock gently like a ship.\nIn fact, the water, which had penetrated the terrace, had broken up the\npath before it; its wheels stuck in the mire; the head of Spendius,\nwith distended cheeks blowing an ivory cornet, appeared between leathern\ncurtains on the first story. The great machine, as though convulsively\nupheaved, advanced perhaps ten paces; but the ground softened more and\nmore, the mire reached to the axles, and the helepolis stopped, leaning\nover frightfully to one side. The catapult rolled to the edge of the\nplatform, and carried away by the weight of its beam, fell, shattering\nthe lower stories beneath it. The soldiers who were standing on the\ndoors slipped into the abyss, or else held on to the extremities of\nthe long beams, and by their weight increased the inclination of the\nhelepolis, which was going to pieces with creakings in all its joints.\n\nThe other Barbarians rushed up to help them, massing themselves into\na compact crowd. The Carthaginians descended from the rampart, and,\nassailing them in the rear, killed them at leisure. But the chariots\nfurnished with sickles hastened up, and galloped round the outskirts of\nthe multitude. The latter ascended the wall again; night came on; and\nthe Barbarians gradually retired.\n\nNothing could now be seen on the plain but a sort of perfectly black,\nswarming mass, which extended from the bluish gulf to the purely white\nlagoon; and the lake, which had received streams of blood, stretched\nfurther away like a great purple pool.\n\nThe terrace was now so laden with corpses that it looked as though it\nhad been constructed of human bodies. In the centre stood the helepolis\ncovered with armour; and from time to time huge fragments broke off\nfrom it, like stones from a crumbling pyramid. Broad tracks made by\nthe streams of lead might be distinguished on the walls. A broken-down\nwooden tower burned here and there, and the houses showed dimly like the\nstages of a ruined ampitheatre. Heavy fumes of smoke were rising, and\nrolling with them sparks which were lost in the dark sky.\n\nThe Carthaginians, however, who were consumed by thirst, had rushed to\nthe cisterns. They broke open the doors. A miry swamp stretched at the\nbottom.\n\nWhat was to be done now? Moreover, the Barbarians were countless, and\nwhen their fatigue was over they would begin again.\n\nThe people deliberated all night in groups at the corners of the\nstreets. Some said that they ought to send away the women, the sick, and\nthe old men; others proposed to abandon the town, and found a colony far\naway. But vessels were lacking, and when the sun appeared no decision\nhad been made.\n\nThere was no fighting that day, all being too much exhausted. The\nsleepers looked like corpses.\n\nThen the Carthaginians, reflecting upon the cause of their disasters,\nremembered that they had not dispatched to Phoenicia the annual offering\ndue to Tyrian Melkarth, and a great terror came upon them. The gods\nwere indignant with the Republic, and were, no doubt, about to prosecute\ntheir vengeance.\n\nThey were considered as cruel masters, who were appeased with\nsupplications and allowed themselves to be bribed with presents. All\nwere feeble in comparison with Moloch the Devourer. The existence, the\nvery flesh of men, belonged to him; and hence in order to preserve it,\nthe Carthaginians used to offer up a portion of it to him, which calmed\nhis fury. Children were burned on the forehead, or on the nape of the\nneck, with woollen wicks; and as this mode of satisfying Baal brought\nin much money to the priests, they failed not to recommend it as being\neasier and more pleasant.\n\nThis time, however, the Republic itself was at stake. But as every\nprofit must be purchased by some loss, and as every transaction was\nregulated according to the needs of the weaker and the demands of the\nstronger, there was no pain great enough for the god, since he delighted\nin such as was of the most horrible description, and all were now at his\nmercy. He must accordingly be fully gratified. Precedents showed that\nin this way the scourge would be made to disappear. Moreover, it was\nbelieved that an immolation by fire would purify Carthage. The ferocity\nof the people was predisposed towards it. The choice, too, must fall\nexclusively upon the families of the great.\n\nThe Ancients assembled. The sitting was a long one. Hanno had come to\nit. As he was now unable to sit he remained lying down near the door,\nhalf hidden among the fringes of the lofty tapestry; and when the\npontiff of Moloch asked them whether they would consent to surrender\ntheir children, his voice suddenly broke forth from the shadow like the\nroaring of a genius in the depths of a cavern. He regretted, he said,\nthat he had none of his own blood to give; and he gazed at Hamilcar,\nwho faced him at the other end of the hall. The Suffet was so much\ndisconcerted by this look that it made him lower his eyes. All\nsuccessively bent their heads in approval; and in accordance with the\nrites he had to reply to the high priest: \"Yes; be it so.\" Then the\nAncients decreed the sacrifice in traditional circumlocution,--because\nthere are things more troublesome to say than to perform.\n\nThe decision was almost immediately known in Carthage, and lamentations\nresounded. The cries of women might everywhere be heard; their husbands\nconsoled them, or railed at them with remonstrances.\n\nBut three hours afterwards extraordinary tidings were spread abroad: the\nSuffet had discovered springs at the foot of the cliff. There was a rush\nto the place. Water might be seen in holes dug in the sand, and some\nwere already lying flat on the ground and drinking.\n\nHamilcar did not himself know whether it was by the determination of the\ngods or through the vague recollection of a revelation which his father\nhad once made to him; but on leaving the Ancients he had gone down to\nthe shore and had begun to dig the gravel with his slaves.\n\nHe gave clothing, boots, and wine. He gave all the rest of the corn that\nhe was keeping by him. He even let the crowd enter his palace, and he\nopened kitchens, stores, and all the rooms,--Salammbo's alone excepted.\nHe announced that six thousand Gaulish Mercenaries were coming, and that\nthe king of Macedonia was sending soldiers.\n\nBut on the second day the springs diminished, and on the evening of the\nthird they were completely dried up. Then the decree of the Ancients\npassed everywhere from lip to lip, and the priests of Moloch began their\ntask.\n\nMen in black robes presented themselves in the houses. In many instances\nthe owners had deserted them under pretence of some business, or of some\ndainty that they were going to buy; and the servants of Moloch came and\ntook the children away. Others themselves surrendered them stupidly.\nThen they were brought to the temple of Tanith, where the priestesses\nwere charged with their amusement and support until the solemn day.\n\nThey visited Hamilcar suddenly and found him in his gardens.\n\n\"Barca! we come for that that you know of--your son!\" They added that\nsome people had met him one evening during the previous moon in the\ncentre of the Mappalian district being led by an old man.\n\nHe was as though suffocated at first. But speedily understanding that\nany denial would be in vain, Hamilcar bowed; and he brought them into\nthe commercial house. Some slaves who had run up at a sign kept watch\nall round about it.\n\nHe entered Salammbo's room in a state of distraction. He seized Hannibal\nwith one hand, snatched up the cord of a trailing garment with the\nother, tied his feet and hands with it, thrust the end into his mouth\nto form a gag, and hid him under the bed of the ox-hides by letting an\nample drapery fall to the ground.\n\nAfterwards he walked about from right to left, raised his arms, wheeled\nround, bit his lips. Then he stood still with staring eyelids, and\npanted as though he were about to die.\n\nBut he clapped his hands three times. Giddenem appeared.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said, \"go and take from among the slaves a male child from\neight to nine years of age, with black hair and swelling forehead! Bring\nhim here! make haste!\"\n\nGiddenem soon entered again, bringing forward a young boy.\n\nHe was a miserable child, at once lean and bloated; his skin looked\ngreyish, like the infected rag hanging to his sides; his head was sunk\nbetween his shoulders, and with the back of his hand he was rubbing his\neyes, which were filled with flies.\n\nHow could he ever be confounded with Hannibal! and there was no time\nto choose another. Hamilcar looked at Giddenem; he felt inclined to\nstrangle him.\n\n\"Begone!\" he cried; and the master of the slaves fled.\n\nThe misfortune which he had so long dreaded was therefore come, and with\nextravagant efforts he strove to discover whether there was not some\nmode, some means to escape it.\n\nAbdalonim suddenly spoke from behind the door. The Suffet was being\nasked for. The servants of Moloch were growing impatient.\n\nHamilcar repressed a cry as though a red hot iron had burnt him; and\nhe began anew to pace the room like one distraught. Then he sank down\nbeside the balustrade, and, with his elbows on his knees, pressed his\nforehead into his shut fists.\n\nThe porphyry basin still contained a little clear water for Salammbo's\nablutions. In spite of his repugnance and all his pride, the Suffet\ndipped the child into it, and, like a slave merchant, began to wash him\nand rub him with strigils and red earth. Then he took two purple squares\nfrom the receptacles round the wall, placed one on his breast and the\nother on his back, and joined them together on the collar bones with\ntwo diamond clasps. He poured perfume upon his head, passed an\nelectrum necklace around his neck, and put on him sandals with heels of\npearl,--sandals belonging to his own daughter! But he stamped with shame\nand vexation; Salammbo, who busied herself in helping him, was as pale\nas he. The child, dazzled by such splendour, smiled and, growing bold\neven, was beginning to clap his hands and jump, when Hamilcar took him\naway.\n\nHe held him firmly by the arm as though he were afraid of losing him,\nand the child, who was hurt, wept a little as he ran beside him.\n\nWhen on a level with the ergastulum, under a palm tree, a voice was\nraised, a mournful and supplicant voice. It murmured: \"Master! oh!\nmaster!\"\n\nHamilcar turned and beside him perceived a man of abject appearance, one\nof the wretches who led a haphazard existence in the household.\n\n\"What do you want?\" said the Suffet.\n\nThe slave, who trembled horribly, stammered:\n\n\"I am his father!\"\n\nHamilcar walked on; the other followed him with stooping loins, bent\nhams, and head thrust forward. His face was convulsed with unspeakable\nanguish, and he was choking with suppressed sobs, so eager was he at\nonce to question him, and to cry: \"Mercy!\"\n\nAt last he ventured to touch him lightly with one finger on the elbow.\n\n\"Are you going to--?\" He had not the strength to finish, and Hamilcar\nstopped quite amazed at such grief.\n\nHe had never thought--so immense was the abyss separating them from\neach other--that there could be anything in common between them. It\neven appeared to him a sort of outrage, an encroachment upon his\nown privileges. He replied with a look colder and heavier than an\nexecutioner's axe; the slave swooned and fell in the dust at his feet.\nHamilcar strode across him.\n\nThe three black-robed men were waiting in the great hall, and standing\nagainst the stone disc. Immediately he tore his garments, and rolled\nupon the pavement uttering piercing cries.\n\n\"Ah! poor little Hannibal! Oh! my son! my consolation! my hope! my life!\nKill me also! take me away! Woe! Woe!\" He ploughed his face with his\nnails, tore out his hair, and shrieked like the women who lament at\nfunerals. \"Take him away then! my suffering is too great! begone! kill\nme like him!\" The servants of Moloch were astonished that the great\nHamilcar was so weak-spirited. They were almost moved by it.\n\nA noise of naked feet became audible, with a broken throat-rattling like\nthe breathing of a wild beast speeding along, and a man, pale, terrible,\nand with outspread arms appeared on the threshold of the third gallery,\nbetween the ivory pots; he exclaimed:\n\n\"My child!\"\n\nHamilcar threw himself with a bound upon the slave, and covering the\nman's mouth with his hand exclaimed still more loudly:\n\n\"It is the old man who reared him! he calls him 'my child!' it will make\nhim mad! enough! enough!\" And hustling away the three priests and their\nvictim he went out with them and with a great kick shut the door behind\nhim.\n\nHamilcar strained his ears for some minutes in constant fear of seeing\nthem return. He then thought of getting rid of the slave in order to\nbe quite sure that he would see nothing; but the peril had not wholly\ndisappeared, and, if the gods were provoked at the man's death, it might\nbe turned against his son. Then, changing his intention, he sent him\nby Taanach the best from his kitchens--a quarter of a goat, beans, and\npreserved pomegranates. The slave, who had eaten nothing for a long\ntime, rushed upon them; his tears fell into the dishes.\n\nHamilcar at last returned to Salammbo, and unfastened Hannibal's cords.\nThe child in exasperation bit his hand until the blood came. He repelled\nhim with a caress.\n\nTo make him remain quiet Salammbo tried to frighten him with Lamia, a\nCyrenian ogress.\n\n\"But where is she?\" he asked.\n\nHe was told that brigands were coming to put him into prison. \"Let them\ncome,\" he rejoined, \"and I will kill them!\"\n\nThen Hamilcar told him the frightful truth. But he fell into a passion\nwith his father, contending that he was quite able to annihilate the\nwhole people, since he was the master of Carthage.\n\nAt last, exhausted by his exertions and anger, he fell into a wild\nsleep. He spoke in his dreams, his back leaning against a scarlet\ncushion; his head was thrown back somewhat, and his little arm,\noutstretched from his body, lay quite straight in an attitude of\ncommand.\n\nWhen the night had grown dark Hamilcar lifted him up gently, and,\nwithout a torch, went down the galley staircase. As he passed through\nthe mercantile house he took up a basket of grapes and a flagon of pure\nwater; the child awoke before the statue of Aletes in the vault of gems,\nand he smiled--like the other--on his father's arm at the brilliant\nlights which surrounded him.\n\nHamilcar felt quite sure that his son could not be taken from him. It\nwas an impenetrable spot communicating with the beach by a subterranean\npassage which he alone knew, and casting his eyes around he inhaled\na great draught of air. Then he set him down upon a stool beside some\ngolden shields. No one at present could see him; he had no further need\nfor watching; and he relieved his feelings. Like a mother finding her\nfirst-born that was lost, he threw himself upon his son; he clasped him\nto his breast, he laughed and wept at the same time, he called him\nby the fondest names and covered him with kisses; little Hannibal was\nfrightened by this terrible tenderness and was silent now.\n\nHamilcar returned with silent steps, feeling the walls around him, and\ncame into the great hall where the moonlight entered through one of the\napertures in the dome; in the centre the slave lay sleeping after his\nrepast, stretched at full length upon the marble pavement. He looked at\nhim and was moved with a sort of pity. With the tip of his cothurn he\npushed forward a carpet beneath his head. Then he raised his eyes and\ngazed at Tanith, whose slender crescent was shining in the sky, and felt\nhimself stronger than the Baals and full of contempt for them.\n\nThe arrangements for the sacrifice were already begun.\n\nPart of a wall in the temple of Moloch was thrown down in order to draw\nout the brazen god without touching the ashes of the altar. Then as\nsoon as the sun appeared the hierodules pushed it towards the square of\nKhamon.\n\nIt moved backwards sliding upon cylinders; its shoulders overlapped the\nwalls. No sooner did the Carthaginians perceive it in the distance than\nthey speedily took to flight, for the Baal could be looked upon with\nimpunity only when exercising his wrath.\n\nA smell of aromatics spread through the streets. All the temples\nhad just been opened simultaneously, and from them there came forth\ntabernacles borne upon chariots, or upon litters carried by the\npontiffs. Great plumes swayed at the corners of them, and rays were\nemitted from their slender pinnacles which terminated in balls of\ncrystal, gold, silver or copper.\n\nThese were the Chanaanitish Baalim, offshoots of the supreme Baal, who\nwere returning to their first cause to humble themselves before his\nmight and annihilate themselves in his splendour.\n\nMelkarth's pavilion, which was of fine purple, sheltered a petroleum\nflare; on Khamon's, which was of hyacinth colour, there rose an ivory\nphallus bordered with a circle of gems; between Eschmoun's curtains,\nwhich were as blue as the ether, a sleeping python formed a circle with\nhis tail, and the Pataec gods, held in the arms of their priests, looked\nlike great infants in swaddling clothes with their heels touching the\nground.\n\nThen came all the inferior forms of the Divinity: Baal-Samin, god of\ncelestial space; Baal-Peor, god of the sacred mountains; Baal-Zeboub,\ngod of corruption, with those of the neighbouring countries and\ncongenerous races: the Iarbal of Libya, the Adramelech of Chaldaea,\nthe Kijun of the Syrians; Derceto, with her virgin's face, crept on\nher fins, and the corpse of Tammouz was drawn along in the midst of a\ncatafalque among torches and heads of hair. In order to subdue the kings\nof the firmament to the Sun, and prevent their particular influences\nfrom disturbing his, diversely coloured metal stars were brandished\nat the end of long poles; and all were there, from the dark Neblo, the\ngenius of Mercury, to the hideous Rahab, which is the constellation of\nthe Crocodile. The Abbadirs, stones which had fallen from the moon, were\nwhirling in slings of silver thread; little loaves, representing the\nfemale form, were born on baskets by the priests of Ceres; others\nbrought their fetishes and amulets; forgotten idols reappeared, while\nthe mystic symbols had been taken from the very ships as though Carthage\nwished to concentrate herself wholly upon a single thought of death and\ndesolation.\n\nBefore each tabernacle a man balanced a large vase of smoking incense on\nhis head. Clouds hovered here and there, and the hangings, pendants,\nand embroideries of the sacred pavilions might be distinguished amid\nthe thick vapours. These advanced slowly owing to their enormous weight.\nSometimes the axles became fast in the streets; then the pious took\nadvantage of the opportunity to touch the Baalim with their garments,\nwhich they preserved afterwards as holy things.\n\nThe brazen statue continued to advance towards the square of Khamon. The\nrich, carrying sceptres with emerald balls, set out from the bottom\nof Megara; the Ancients, with diadems on their heads, had assembled in\nKinisdo, and masters of the finances, governors of provinces, sailors,\nand the numerous horde employed at funerals, all with the insignia of\ntheir magistracies or the instruments of their calling, were making\ntheir way towards the tabernacles which were descending from the\nAcropolis between the colleges of the pontiffs.\n\nOut of deference to Moloch they had adorned themselves with the most\nsplendid jewels. Diamonds sparkled on their black garments; but their\nrings were too large and fell from their wasted hands,--nor could there\nhave been anything so mournful as this silent crowd where earrings\ntapped against pale faces, and gold tiaras clasped brows contracted with\nstern despair.\n\nAt last the Baal arrived exactly in the centre of the square. His\npontiffs arranged an enclosure with trellis-work to keep off the\nmultitude, and remained around him at his feet.\n\nThe priests of Khamon, in tawny woollen robes, formed a line before\ntheir temple beneath the columns of the portico; those of Eschmoun, in\nlinen mantles with necklaces of koukouphas' heads and pointed tiaras,\nposted themselves on the steps of the Acropolis; the priests of\nMelkarth, in violet tunics, took the western side; the priests of the\nAbbadirs, clasped with bands of Phrygian stuffs, placed themselves on\nthe east, while towards the south, with the necromancers all covered\nwith tattooings, and the shriekers in patched cloaks, were ranged the\ncurates of the Pataec gods, and the Yidonim, who put the bone of a dead\nman into their mouths to learn the future. The priests of Ceres, who\nwere dressed in blue robes, had prudently stopped in the street of\nSatheb, and in low tones were chanting a thesmophorion in the Megarian\ndialect.\n\nFrom time to time files of men arrived, completely naked, their arms\noutstretched, and all holding one another by the shoulders. From\nthe depths of their breasts they drew forth a hoarse and cavernous\nintonation; their eyes, which were fastened upon the colossus, shone\nthrough the dust, and they swayed their bodies simultaneously, and at\nequal distances, as though they were all affected by a single movement.\nThey were so frenzied that to restore order the hierodules compelled\nthem, with blows of the stick, to lie flat upon the ground, with their\nfaces resting against the brass trellis-work.\n\nThen it was that a man in a white robe advanced from the back of the\nsquare. He penetrated the crowd slowly, and people recognised a priest\nof Tanith--the high-priest Schahabarim. Hootings were raised, for the\ntyranny of the male principle prevailed that day in all consciences, and\nthe goddess was actually so completely forgotten that the absence of her\npontiffs had not been noticed. But the amazement was increased when he\nwas seen to open one of the doors of the trellis-work intended for\nthose who intended to offer up victims. It was an outrage to their god,\nthought the priests of Moloch, that he had just committed, and they\nsought with eager gestures to repel him. Fed on the meat of the\nholocausts, clad in purple like kings, and wearing triple-storied\ncrowns, they despised the pale eunuch, weakened with his macerations,\nand angry laughter shook their black beards, which were displayed on\ntheir breasts in the sun.\n\nSchahabarim walked on, giving no reply, and, traversing the whole\nenclosure with deliberation, reached the legs of the colossus; then,\nspreading out both arms, he touched it on both sides, which was a solemn\nform of adoration. For a long time Rabbet had been torturing him, and\nin despair, or perhaps for lack of a god that completely satisfied his\nideas, he had at last decided for this one.\n\nThe crowd, terrified by this act of apostasy, uttered a lengthened\nmurmur. It was felt that the last tie which bound their souls to a\nmerciful divinity was breaking.\n\nBut owing to his mutilation, Schahabarim could take no part in the cult\nof the Baal. The men in the red cloaks shut him out from the enclosure;\nthen, when he was outside, he went round all the colleges in succession,\nand the priest, henceforth without a god, disappeared into the crowd. It\nscattered at his approach.\n\nMeanwhile a fire of aloes, cedar, and laurel was burning between the\nlegs of the colossus. The tips of its long wings dipped into the flame;\nthe unguents with which it had been rubbed flowed like sweat over its\nbrazen limbs. Around the circular flagstone on which its feet rested,\nthe children, wrapped in black veils, formed a motionless circle; and\nits extravagantly long arms reached down their palms to them as though\nto seize the crown that they formed and carry it to the sky.\n\nThe rich, the Ancients, the women, the whole multitude, thronged behind\nthe priests and on the terraces of the houses. The large painted stars\nrevolved no longer; the tabernacles were set upon the ground; and the\nfumes from the censers ascended perpendicularly, spreading their bluish\nbranches through the azure like gigantic trees.\n\nMany fainted; others became inert and petrified in their ecstasy.\nInfinite anguish weighed upon the breasts of the beholders. The\nlast shouts died out one by one,--and the people of Carthage stood\nbreathless, and absorbed in the longing of their terror.\n\nAt last the high priest of Moloch passed his left hand beneath the\nchildren's veils, plucked a lock of hair from their foreheads, and threw\nit upon the flames. Then the men in the red cloaks chanted the sacred\nhymn:\n\n\"Homage to thee, Sun! king of the two zones, self-generating Creator,\nFather and Mother, Father and Son, God and Goddess, Goddess and God!\"\nAnd their voices were lost in the outburst of instruments sounding\nsimultaneously to drown the cries of the victims. The eight-stringed\nscheminiths, the kinnors which had ten strings, and the nebals which\nhad twelve, grated, whistled, and thundered. Enormous leathern bags,\nbristling with pipes, made a shrill clashing noise; the tabourines,\nbeaten with all the players' might, resounded with heavy, rapid blows;\nand, in spite of the fury of the clarions, the salsalim snapped like\ngrasshoppers' wings.\n\nThe hierodules, with a long hook, opened the seven-storied compartments\non the body of the Baal. They put meal into the highest, two\nturtle-doves into the second, an ape into the third, a ram into the\nfourth, a sheep into the fifth, and as no ox was to be had for the\nsixth, a tawny hide taken from the sanctuary was thrown into it. The\nseventh compartment yawned empty still.\n\nBefore undertaking anything it was well to make trial of the arms of the\ngod. Slender chainlets stretched from his fingers up to his shoulders\nand fell behind, where men by pulling them made the two hands rise to a\nlevel with the elbows, and come close together against the belly; they\nwere moved several times in succession with little abrupt jerks. Then\nthe instruments were still. The fire roared.\n\nThe pontiffs of Moloch walked about on the great flagstone scanning the\nmultitude.\n\nAn individual sacrifice was necessary, a perfectly voluntary oblation,\nwhich was considered as carrying the others along with it. But no one\nhad appeared up to the present, and the seven passages leading from the\nbarriers to the colossus were completely empty. Then the priests, to\nencourage the people, drew bodkins from their girdles and gashed their\nfaces. The Devotees, who were stretched on the ground outside, were\nbrought within the enclosure. A bundle of horrible irons was thrown to\nthem, and each chose his own torture. They drove in spits between their\nbreasts; they split their cheeks; they put crowns of thorns upon their\nheads; then they twined their arms together, and surrounded the children\nin another large circle which widened and contracted in turns. They\nreached to the balustrade, they threw themselves back again, and then\nbegan once more, attracting the crowd to them by the dizziness of their\nmotion with its accompanying blood and shrieks.\n\nBy degrees people came into the end of the passages; they flung into\nthe flames pearls, gold vases, cups, torches, all their wealth; the\nofferings became constantly more numerous and more splendid. At last a\nman who tottered, a man pale and hideous with terror, thrust forward\na child; then a little black mass was seen between the hands of the\ncolossus, and sank into the dark opening. The priests bent over the edge\nof the great flagstone,--and a new song burst forth celebrating the joys\nof death and of new birth into eternity.\n\nThe children ascended slowly, and as the smoke formed lofty eddies as\nit escaped, they seemed at a distance to disappear in a cloud. Not\none stirred. Their wrists and ankles were tied, and the dark drapery\nprevented them from seeing anything and from being recognised.\n\nHamilcar, in a red cloak, like the priests of Moloch, was beside the\nBaal, standing upright in front of the great toe of its right foot. When\nthe fourteenth child was brought every one could see him make a great\ngesture of horror. But he soon resumed his former attitude, folded his\narms, and looked upon the ground. The high pontiff stood on the other\nside of the statue as motionless as he. His head, laden with an Assyrian\nmitre, was bent, and he was watching the gold plate on his breast; it\nwas covered with fatidical stones, and the flame mirrored in it formed\nirisated lights. He grew pale and dismayed. Hamilcar bent his brow; and\nthey were both so near the funeral-pile that the hems of their cloaks\nbrushed it as they rose from time to time.\n\nThe brazen arms were working more quickly. They paused no longer. Every\ntime that a child was placed in them the priests of Moloch spread\nout their hands upon him to burden him with the crimes of the people,\nvociferating: \"They are not men but oxen!\" and the multitude round\nabout repeated: \"Oxen! oxen!\" The devout exclaimed: \"Lord! eat!\" and\nthe priests of Proserpine, complying through terror with the needs of\nCarthage, muttered the Eleusinian formula: \"Pour out rain! bring forth!\"\n\nThe victims, when scarcely at the edge of the opening, disappeared like\na drop of water on a red-hot plate, and white smoke rose amid the great\nscarlet colour.\n\nNevertheless, the appetite of the god was not appeased. He ever wished\nfor more. In order to furnish him with a larger supply, the victims were\npiled up on his hands with a big chain above them which kept them in\ntheir place. Some devout persons had at the beginning wished to count\nthem, to see whether their number corresponded with the days of\nthe solar year; but others were brought, and it was impossible to\ndistinguish them in the giddy motion of the horrible arms. This lasted\nfor a long, indefinite time until the evening. Then the partitions\ninside assumed a darker glow, and burning flesh could be seen. Some even\nbelieved that they could descry hair, limbs, and whole bodies.\n\nNight fell; clouds accumulated above the Baal. The funeral-pile, which\nwas flameless now, formed a pyramid of coals up to his knees; completely\nred like a giant covered with blood, he looked, with his head\nthrown back, as though he were staggering beneath the weight of his\nintoxication.\n\nIn proportion as the priests made haste, the frenzy of the people\nincreased; as the number of the victims was diminishing, some cried\nout to spare them, others that still more were needful. The walls, with\ntheir burden of people, seemed to be giving way beneath the howlings\nof terror and mystic voluptuousness. Then the faithful came into the\npassages, dragging their children, who clung to them; and they beat them\nin order to make them let go, and handed them over to the men in red.\nThe instrument-players sometimes stopped through exhaustion; then the\ncries of the mothers might be heard, and the frizzling of the fat as it\nfell upon the coals. The henbane-drinkers crawled on all fours around\nthe colossus, roaring like tigers; the Yidonim vaticinated, the Devotees\nsang with their cloven lips; the trellis-work had been broken through,\nall wished for a share in the sacrifice;--and fathers, whose children\nhad died previously, cast their effigies, their playthings, their\npreserved bones into the fire. Some who had knives rushed upon the rest.\nThey slaughtered one another. The hierodules took the fallen ashes at\nthe edge of the flagstone in bronze fans, and cast them into the air\nthat the sacrifice might be scattered over the town and even to the\nregion of the stars.\n\nThe loud noise and great light had attracted the Barbarians to the foot\nof the walls; they clung to the wreck of the helepolis to have a better\nview, and gazed open-mouthed in horror.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE PASS OF THE HATCHET\n\nThe Carthaginians had not re-entered their houses when the clouds\naccumulated more thickly; those who raised their heads towards the\ncolossus could feel big drops on their foreheads, and the rain fell.\n\nIt fell the whole night plentifully, in floods; the thunder growled; it\nwas the voice of Moloch; he had vanquished Tanith; and she, being now\nfecundated, opened up her vast bosom in heaven's heights. Sometimes she\ncould be seen in a clear and luminous spot stretched upon cushions of\ncloud; and then the darkness would close in again as though she were\nstill too weary and wished to sleep again; the Carthaginians, all\nbelieving that water is brought forth by the moon, shouted to make her\ntravail easy.\n\nThe rain beat upon the terraces and overflowed them, forming lakes in\nthe courts, cascades on the staircases, and eddies at the corners of the\nstreets. It poured in warm heavy masses and urgent streams; big frothy\njets leaped from the corners of all the buildings; and it seemed\nas though whitish cloths hung dimly upon the walls, and the washed\ntemple-roofs shone black in the gleam of the lightning. Torrents\ndescended from the Acropolis by a thousand paths; houses suddenly gave\nway, and small beams, plaster, rubbish, and furniture passed along in\nstreams which ran impetuously over the pavement.\n\nAmphoras, flagons, and canvases had been placed out of doors; but the\ntorches were extinguished; brands were taken from the funeral-pile of\nthe Baal, and the Carthaginians bent back their necks and opened their\nmouths to drink. Others by the side of the miry pools, plunged their\narms into them up to the armpits, and filled themselves so abundantly\nwith water that they vomited it forth like buffaloes. The freshness\ngradually spread; they breathed in the damp air with play of limb, and\nin the happiness of their intoxication boundless hope soon arose. All\ntheir miseries were forgotten. Their country was born anew.\n\nThey felt the need, as it were, of directing upon others the extravagant\nfury which they had been unable to employ against themselves. Such a\nsacrifice could not be in vain; although they felt no remorse they found\nthemselves carried away by the frenzy which results from complicity in\nirreparable crimes.\n\nThe Barbarians had encountered the storm in their ill-closed tents; and\nthey were still quite chilled on the morrow as they tramped through the\nmud in search of their stores and weapons, which were spoiled and lost.\n\nHamilcar went himself to see Hanno, and, in virtue of his plenary\npowers, intrusted the command to him. The old Suffet hesitated for a\nfew minutes between his animosity and his appetite for authority, but he\naccepted nevertheless.\n\nHamilcar next took out a galley armed with a catapult at each end.\nHe placed it in the gulf in front of the raft; then he embarked\nhis stoutest troops on board such vessels as were available. He was\napparently taking to flight; and running northward before the wind he\ndisappeared into the mist.\n\nBut three days afterwards, when the attack was about to begin again,\nsome people arrived tumultuously from the Libyan coast. Barca had\ncome among them. He had carried off provisions everywhere, and he was\nspreading through the country.\n\nThen the Barbarians were indignant as though he were betraying them.\nThose who were most weary of the siege, and especially the Gauls, did\nnot hesitate to leave the walls in order to try and rejoin him. Spendius\nwanted to reconstruct the helepolis; Matho had traced an imaginary line\nfrom his tent to Megara, and inwardly swore to follow it, and none of\ntheir men stirred. But the rest, under the command of Autaritus, went\noff, abandoning the western part of the rampart, and so profound was the\ncarelessness exhibited that no one even thought of replacing them.\n\nNarr' Havas spied them from afar in the mountains. During the night he\nled all his men along the sea-shore on the outer side of the Lagoon, and\nentered Carthage.\n\nHe presented himself as a saviour with six thousand men all carrying\nmeal under their cloaks, and forty elephants laden with forage and dried\nmeat. The people flocked quickly around them; they gave them names. The\nsight of these strong animals, sacred to Baal, gave the Carthaginians\neven more joy than the arrival of such relief; it was a token of the\ntenderness of the god, a proof that he was at last about to interfere in\nthe war to defend them.\n\nNarr' Havas received the compliments of the Ancients. Then he ascended\nto Salammbo's palace.\n\nHe had not seen her again since the time when in Hamilcar's tent amid\nthe five armies he had felt her little, cold, soft hand fastened to his\nown; she had left for Carthage after the betrothal. His love, which\nhad been diverted by other ambitions, had come back to him; and now he\nexpected to enjoy his rights, to marry her, and take her.\n\nSalammbo did not understand how the young man could ever become her\nmaster! Although she asked Tanith every day for Matho's death, her\nhorror of the Libyan was growing less. She vaguely felt that the hate\nwith which he had persecuted her was something almost religious,--and\nshe would fain have seen in Narr' Havas's person a reflection, as it\nwere, of that malice which still dazzled her. She desired to know him\nbetter, and yet his presence would have embarrassed her. She sent him\nword that she could not receive him.\n\nMoreover, Hamilcar had forbidden his people to admit the King of the\nNumidians to see her; by putting off his reward to the end of the war he\nhoped to retain his devotion;--and, through dread of the Suffet, Narr'\nHavas withdrew.\n\nBut he bore himself haughtily towards the Hundred. He changed their\narrangements. He demanded privileges for his men, and placed them\non important posts; thus the Barbarians stared when they perceived\nNumidians on the towers.\n\nThe surprise of the Carthaginians was greater still when three hundred\nof their own people, who had been made prisoners during the Sicilian\nwar, arrived on board an old Punic trireme. Hamilcar, in fact, had\nsecretly sent back to the Quirites the crews of the Latin vessels,\ntaken before the defection of the Tyrian towns; and, to reciprocate the\ncourtesy, Rome was now sending him back her captives. She scorned the\novertures of the Mercenaries in Sardinian, and would not even recognise\nthe inhabitants of Utica as subjects.\n\nHiero, who was ruling at Syracuse, was carried away by this example. For\nthe preservation of his own States it was necessary that an equilibrium\nshould exist between the two peoples; he was interested, therefore, in\nthe safety of the Chanaanites, and he declared himself their friend, and\nsent them twelve hundred oxen, with fifty-three thousand nebels of pure\nwheat.\n\nA deeper reason prompted aid to Carthage. It was felt that if the\nMercenaries triumphed, every one, from soldier to plate-washer, would\nrise, and that no government and no house could resist them.\n\nMeanwhile Hamilcar was scouring the eastern districts. He drove back\nthe Gauls, and all the Barbarians found that they were themselves in\nsomething like a state of siege.\n\nThen he set himself to harass them. He would arrive and then retire, and\nby constantly renewing this manoeuvre, he gradually detached them from\ntheir encampments. Spendius was obliged to follow them, and in the end\nMatho yielded in like manner.\n\nHe did not pass beyond Tunis. He shut himself up within its walls. This\npersistence was full of wisdom, for soon Narr' Havas was to be seen\nissuing from the gate of Khamon with his elephants and soldiers.\nHamilcar was recalling him, but the other Barbarians were already\nwandering about in the provinces in pursuit of the Suffet.\n\nThe latter had received three thousand Gauls from Clypea. He had horses\nbrought to him from Cyrenaica, and armour from Brutium, and began the\nwar again.\n\nNever had his genius been so impetuous and fertile. For five moons he\ndragged his enemies after him. He had an end to which he wished to guide\nthem.\n\nThe Barbarians had at first tried to encompass him with small\ndetachments, but he always escaped them. They ceased to separate then.\nTheir army amounted to about forty thousand men, and several times they\nenjoyed the sight of seeing the Carthaginians fall back.\n\nThe horsemen of Narr' Havas were what they found most tormenting. Often,\nat times of the greatest weariness, when they were advancing over the\nplains, and dozing beneath the weight of their arms, a great line of\ndust would suddenly rise on the horizon; there would be a galloping up\nto them, and a rain of darts would pour from the bosom of a cloud filled\nwith flaming eyes. The Numidians in their white cloaks would utter\nloud shouts, raise their arms, press their rearing stallions with their\nknees, and, wheeling them round abruptly, would then disappear. They had\nalways supplies of javelins and dromedaries some distance off, and they\nwould return more terrible than before, howl like wolves, and take to\nflight like vultures. The Barbarians posted at the extremities of the\nfiles fell one by one; and this would continue until evening, when an\nattempt would be made to enter the mountains.\n\nAlthough they were perilous for elephants, Hamilcar made his way in\namong them. He followed the long chain which extends from the promontory\nof Hermaeum to the top of Zagouan. This, they believed, was a device for\nhiding the insufficiency of his troops. But the continual uncertainty in\nwhich he kept them exasperated them at last more than any defeat. They\ndid not lose heart, and marched after him.\n\nAt last one evening they surprised a body of velites amid some big\nrocks at the entrance of a pass between the Silver Mountain and the Lead\nMountain; the entire army was certainly in front of them, for a noise\nof footsteps and clarions could be heard; the Carthaginians immediately\nfled through the gorge. It descended into a plain, and was shaped like\nan iron hatchet with a surrounding of lofty cliffs. The Barbarians\ndashed into it in order to overtake the velites; quite at the bottom\nother Carthaginians were running tumultuously amid galloping oxen. A man\nin a red cloak was to be seen; it was the Suffet; they shouted this to\none another; and they were carried away with increased fury and joy.\nSeveral, from laziness or prudence, had remained on the threshold of the\npass. But some cavalry, debouching from a wood, beat them down upon\nthe rest with blows of pike and sabre; and soon all the Barbarians were\nbelow in the plain.\n\nThen this great human mass, after swaying to and fro for some time,\nstood still; they could discover no outlet.\n\nThose who were nearest to the pass went back again, but the passage had\nentirely disappeared. They hailed those in front to make them go on;\nthey were being crushed against the mountain, and from a distance they\ninveighed against their companions, who were unable to find the route\nagain.\n\nIn fact the Barbarians had scarcely descended when men who had been\ncrouching behind the rocks raised the latter with beams and overthrew\nthem, and as the slope was steep the huge blocks had rolled down\npell-mell and completely stopped up the narrow opening.\n\nAt the other extremity of the plain stretched a long passage, split in\ngaps here and there, and leading to a ravine which ascended to the upper\nplateau, where the Punic army was stationed. Ladders had been placed\nbeforehand in this passage against the wall of cliff; and, protected by\nthe windings of the gaps, the velites were able to seize and mount them\nbefore being overtaken. Several even made their way to the bottom of the\nravine; they were drawn up with cables, for the ground at this spot was\nof moving sand, and so much inclined that it was impossible to climb\nit even on the knees. The Barbarians arrived almost immediately. But\na portcullis, forty cubits high, and made to fit the intervening space\nexactly, suddenly sank before them like a rampart fallen from the skies.\n\nThe Suffet's combinations had therefore succeeded. None of the\nMercenaries knew the mountain, and, marching as they did at the head\nof their columns, they had drawn on the rest. The rocks, which were\nsomewhat narrow at the base, had been easily cast down; and, while\nall were running, his army had raised shouts, as of distress, on the\nhorizon. Hamilcar, it is true, might have lost his velites, only half of\nwhom remained, but he would have sacrificed twenty times as many for the\nsuccess of such an enterprise.\n\nThe Barbarians pressed forward until morning, in compact files, from one\nend of the plain to the other. They felt the mountain with their hands,\nseeking to discover a passage.\n\nAt last day broke; and they perceived all about them a great white wall\nhewn with the pick. And no means of safety, no hope! The two natural\noutcomes from this blind alley were closed by the portcullis and the\nheaps of rocks.\n\nThen they all looked at one another without speaking. They sank down in\ncollapse, feeling an icy coldness in their loins, and an overwhelming\nweight upon their eyelids.\n\nThey rose, and bounded against the rocks. But the lowest were weighted\nby the pressure of the others, and were immovable. They tried to cling\nto them so as to reach the top, but the bellying shape of the great\nmasses rendered all hold impossible. They sought to cleave the ground on\nboth sides of the gorge, but their instruments broke. They made a large\nfire with the tent poles, but the fire could not burn the mountain.\n\nThey returned to the portcullis; it was garnished with long nails as\nthick as stakes, as sharp as the spines of a porcupine, and closer than\nthe hairs of a brush. But they were animated by such rage that they\ndashed themselves against it. The first were pierced to the backbone,\nthose coming next surged over them, and all fell back, leaving human\nfragments and bloodstained hair on those horrible branches.\n\nWhen their discouragement was somewhat abated, they made an examination\nof the provisions. The Mercenaries, whose baggage was lost, possessed\nscarcely enough for two days; and all the rest found themselves\ndestitute,--for they had been awaiting a convoy promised by the villages\nof the South.\n\nHowever, some bulls were roaming about, those which the Carthaginians\nhad loosed in the gorge to attract the Barbarians. They killed them with\nlance thrusts and ate them, and when their stomachs were filled their\nthoughts were less mournful.\n\nThe next day they slaughtered all the mules to the number of about\nforty; then they scraped the skins, boiled the entrails, pounded the\nbones, and did not yet despair; the army from Tunis had no doubt been\nwarned, and was coming.\n\nBut on the evening of the fifth day their hunger increased; they gnawed\ntheir sword-belts, and the little sponges which bordered the bottom of\ntheir helmets.\n\nThese forty thousand men were massed into the species of hippodrome\nformed by the mountain about them. Some remained in front of the\nportcullis, or at the foot of the rocks; the rest covered the plain\nconfusedly. The strong shunned one another, and the timid sought out the\nbrave, who, nevertheless, were unable to save them.\n\nTo avoid infection, the corpses of the velites had been speedily buried;\nand the position of the graves was no longer visible.\n\nAll the Barbarians lay drooping on the ground. A veteran would pass\nbetween their lines here and there; and they would howl curses against\nthe Carthaginians, against Hamilcar, and against Matho, although he was\ninnocent of their disaster; but it seemed to them that their pains would\nhave been less if he had shared them. Then they groaned, and some wept\nsoftly like little children.\n\nThey came to the captains and besought them to grant them something that\nwould alleviate their sufferings. The others made no reply; or, seized\nwith fury, would pick up a stone and fling it in their faces.\n\nSeveral, in fact, carefully kept a reserve of food in a hole in the\nground--a few handfuls of dates, or a little meal; and they ate this\nduring the night, with their heads bent beneath their cloaks. Those\nwho had swords kept them naked in their hands, and the most suspicious\nremained standing with their backs against the mountain.\n\nThey accused their chiefs and threatened them. Autaritus was not afraid\nof showing himself. With the Barbaric obstinacy which nothing could\ndiscourage, he would advance twenty times a day to the rocks at the\nbottom, hoping every time to find them perchance displaced; and swaying\nhis heavy fur-covered shoulders, he reminded his companions of a bear\ncoming forth from its cave in springtime to see whether the snows are\nmelted.\n\nSpendius, surrounded by the Greeks, hid himself in one of the gaps; as\nhe was afraid, he caused a rumour of his death to be spread.\n\nThey were now hideously lean; their skin was overlaid with bluish\nmarblings. On the evening of the ninth day three Iberians died.\n\nTheir frightened companions left the spot. They were stripped, and the\nwhite, naked bodies lay in the sunshine on the sand.\n\nThen the Garamantians began to prowl slowly round about them. They were\nmen accustomed to existence in solitude, and they reverenced no god. At\nlast the oldest of the band made a sign, and bending over the corpses\nthey cut strips from them with their knives, then squatted upon their\nheels and ate. The rest looked on from a distance; they uttered cries\nof horror;--many, nevertheless, being, at the bottom of their souls,\njealous of such courage.\n\nIn the middle of the night some of these approached, and, dissembling\ntheir eagerness, asked for a small mouthful, merely to try, they said.\nBolder ones came up; their number increased; there was soon a crowd. But\nalmost all of them let their hands fall on feeling the cold flesh on the\nedge of their lips; others, on the contrary, devoured it with delight.\n\nThat they might be led away by example, they urged one another on\nmutually. Such as had at first refused went to see the Garamantians, and\nreturned no more. They cooked the pieces on coals at the point of the\nsword; they salted them with dust, and contended for the best morsels.\nWhen nothing was left of the three corpses, their eyes ranged over the\nwhole plain to find others.\n\nBut were they not in possession of Carthaginians--twenty captives taken\nin the last encounter, whom no one had noticed up to the present? These\ndisappeared; moreover, it was an act of vengeance. Then, as they must\nlive, as the taste for this food had become developed, and as they were\ndying, they cut the throats of the water-carriers, grooms, and all the\nserving-men belonging to the Mercenaries. They killed some of them every\nday. Some ate much, recovered strength, and were sad no more.\n\nSoon this resource failed. Then the longing was directed to the wounded\nand sick. Since they could not recover, it was as well to release\nthem from their tortures; and, as soon as a man began to stagger, all\nexclaimed that he was now lost, and ought to be made use of for the\nrest. Artifices were employed to accelerate their death; the last\nremnant of their foul portion was stolen from them; they were trodden\non as though by inadvertence; those in the last throes wishing to make\nbelieve that they were strong, strove to stretch out their arms, to\nrise, to laugh. Men who had swooned came to themselves at the touch of\na notched blade sawing off a limb;--and they still slew, ferociously and\nneedlessly, to sate their fury.\n\nA mist heavy and warm, such as comes in those regions at the end\nof winter, sank on the fourteenth day upon the army. This change\nof temperature brought numerous deaths with it, and corruption was\ndeveloped with frightful rapidity in the warm dampness which was kept\nin by the sides of the mountain. The drizzle that fell upon the corpses\nsoftened them, and soon made the plain one broad tract of rottenness.\nWhitish vapours floated overhead; they pricked the nostrils, penetrated\nthe skin, and troubled the sight; and the Barbarians thought that\nthrough the exhalations of the breath they could see the souls of their\ncompanions. They were overwhelmed with immense disgust. They wished for\nnothing more; they preferred to die.\n\nTwo days afterwards the weather became fine again, and hunger seized\nthem once more. It seemed to them that their stomachs were being\nwrenched from them with tongs. Then they rolled about in convulsions,\nflung handfuls of dust into their mouths, bit their arms, and burst into\nfrantic laughter.\n\nThey were still more tormented by thirst, for they had not a drop of\nwater, the leathern bottles having been completely dried up since the\nninth day. To cheat their need they applied their tongues to the metal\nplates on their waist-belts, their ivory pommels, and the steel of their\nswords. Some former caravan-leaders tightened their waists with ropes.\nOthers sucked a pebble. They drank urine cooled in their brazen helmets.\n\nAnd they still expected the army from Tunis! The length of time which it\ntook in coming was, according to their conjectures, an assurance of its\nearly arrival. Besides, Matho, who was a brave fellow, would not desert\nthem. \"'Twill be to-morrow!\" they would say to one another; and then\nto-morrow would pass.\n\nAt the beginning they had offered up prayers and vows, and practised all\nkinds of incantations. Just now their only feeling to their divinities\nwas one of hatred, and they strove to revenge themselves by believing in\nthem no more.\n\nMen of violent disposition perished first; the Africans held out\nbetter than the Gauls. Zarxas lay stretched at full length among the\nBalearians, his hair over his arm, inert. Spendius found a plant with\nbroad leaves filled abundantly with juice, and after declaring that it\nwas poisonous, so as to keep off the rest, he fed himself upon it.\n\nThey were too weak to knock down the flying crows with stones. Sometimes\nwhen a gypaetus was perched on a corpse, and had been mangling it for\na long time, a man would set himself to crawl towards it with a javelin\nbetween his teeth. He would support himself with one hand, and after\ntaking a good aim, throw his weapon. The white-feathered creature,\ndisturbed by the noise, would desist and look about in tranquil fashion\nlike a cormorant on a rock, and would then again thrust in its hideous,\nyellow beak, while the man, in despair, would fall flat on his face in\nthe dust. Some succeeded in discovering chameleons and serpents. But it\nwas the love of life that kept them alive. They directed their souls to\nthis idea exclusively, and clung to existence by an effort of the will\nthat prolonged it.\n\nThe most stoical kept close to one another, seated in a circle here and\nthere, among the dead in the middle of the plain; and wrapped in their\ncloaks they gave themselves up silently to their sadness.\n\nThose who had been born in towns recalled the resounding streets, the\ntaverns, theatres, baths, and the barbers' shops where there are tales\nto be heard. Others could once more see country districts at sunset,\nwhen the yellow corn waves, and the great oxen ascend the hills again\nwith the ploughshares on their necks. Travellers dreamed of cisterns,\nhunters of their forests, veterans of battles; and in the somnolence\nthat benumbed them their thoughts jostled one another with the\nprecipitancy and clearness of dreams. Hallucinations came suddenly upon\nthem; they sought for a door in the mountain in order to flee, and tried\nto pass through it. Others thought that they were sailing in a storm\nand gave orders for the handling of a ship, or else fell back in terror,\nperceiving Punic battalions in the clouds. There were some who imagined\nthemselves at a feast, and sang.\n\nMany through a strange mania would repeat the same word or continually\nmake the same gesture. Then when they happened to raise their heads\nand look at one another they were choked with sobs on discovering the\nhorrible ravages made in their faces. Some had ceased to suffer, and to\nwhile away the hours told of the perils which they had escaped.\n\nDeath was certain and imminent to all. How many times had they not tried\nto open up a passage! As to implore terms from the conqueror, by what\nmeans could they do so? They did not even know where Hamilcar was.\n\nThe wind was blowing from the direction of the ravine. It made the sand\nflow perpetually in cascades over the portcullis; and the cloaks and\nhair of the Barbarians were being covered with it as though the earth\nwere rising upon them and desirous of burying them. Nothing stirred; the\neternal mountain seemed still higher to them every morning.\n\nSometimes flights of birds darted past beneath the blue sky in the\nfreedom of the air. The men closed their eyes that they might not see\nthem.\n\nAt first they felt a buzzing in their ears, their nails grew black, the\ncold reached to their breasts; they lay upon their sides and expired\nwithout a cry.\n\nOn the nineteenth day two thousand Asiatics were dead, with fifteen\nhundred from the Archipelago, eight thousand from Libya, the youngest\nof the Mercenaries and whole tribes--in all twenty thousand soldiers, or\nhalf of the army.\n\nAutaritus, who had only fifty Gauls left, was going to kill himself in\norder to put an end to this state of things, when he thought he saw a\nman on the top of the mountain in front of him.\n\nOwing to his elevation this man did not appear taller than a dwarf.\nHowever, Autaritus recognised a shield shaped like a trefoil on his\nleft arm. \"A Carthaginian!\" he exclaimed, and immediately throughout\nthe plain, before the portcullis and beneath the rocks, all rose. The\nsoldier was walking along the edge of the precipice; the Barbarians\ngazed at him from below.\n\nSpendius picked up the head of an ox; then having formed a diadem with\ntwo belts, he fixed it on the horns at the end of a pole in token of\npacific intentions. The Carthaginian disappeared. They waited.\n\nAt last in the evening a sword-belt suddenly fell from above like a\nstone loosened from the cliff. It was made of red leather covered with\nembroidery, with three diamond stars, and stamped in the centre, it bore\nthe mark of the Great Council: a horse beneath a palm-tree. This was\nHamilcar's reply, the safe-conduct that he sent them.\n\nThey had nothing to fear; any change of fortune brought with it the end\nof their woes. They were moved with extravagant joy, they embraced one\nanother, they wept. Spendius, Autaritus, and Zarxas, four Italiotes,\na Negro and two Spartans offered themselves as envoys. They were\nimmediately accepted. They did not know, however, by what means they\nshould get away.\n\nBut a cracking sounded in the direction of the rocks; and the most\nelevated of them, after rocking to and fro, rebounded to the bottom. In\nfact, if they were immovable on the side of the Barbarians--for it would\nhave been necessary to urge them up an incline plane, and they were,\nmoreover, heaped together owing to the narrowness of the gorge--on the\nothers, on the contrary, it was sufficient to drive against them with\nviolence to make them descend. The Carthaginians pushed them, and at\ndaybreak they projected into the plain like the steps of an immense\nruined staircase.\n\nThe Barbarians were still unable to climb them. Ladders were held out\nfor their assistance; all rushed upon them. The discharge of a catapult\ndrove the crowd back; only the Ten were taken away.\n\nThey walked amid the Clinabarians, leaning their hands on the horses'\ncroups for support.\n\nNow that their first joy was over they began to harbour anxieties.\nHamilcar's demands would be cruel. But Spendius reassured them.\n\n\"I will speak!\" And he boasted that he knew excellent things to say for\nthe safety of the army.\n\nBehind all the bushes they met with ambushed sentries, who prostrated\nthemselves before the sword-belt which Spendius had placed over his\nshoulder.\n\nWhen they reached the Punic camp the crowd flocked around them, and they\nthought that they could hear whisperings and laughter. The door of a\ntent opened.\n\nHamilcar was at the very back of it seated on a stool beside a table on\nwhich there shone a naked sword. He was surrounded by captains, who were\nstanding.\n\nHe started back on perceiving these men, and then bent over to examine\nthem.\n\nTheir pupils were strangely dilated, and there was a great black circle\nround their eyes, which extended to the lower parts of their ears; their\nbluish noses stood out between their hollow cheeks, which were chinked\nwith deep wrinkles; the skin of their bodies was too large for their\nmuscles, and was hidden beneath a slate-coloured dust; their lips were\nglued to their yellow teeth; they exhaled an infectious odour; they\nmight have been taken for half-opened tombs, for living sepulchres.\n\nIn the centre of the tent, on a mat on which the captains were about to\nsit down, there was a dish of smoking gourds. The Barbarians fastened\ntheir eyes upon it with a shivering in all their limbs, and tears came\nto their eyelids; nevertheless they restrained themselves.\n\nHamilcar turned away to speak to some one. Then they all flung\nthemselves upon it, flat on the ground. Their faces were soaked in the\nfat, and the noise of their deglutition was mingled with the sobs of joy\nwhich they uttered. Through astonishment, doubtless, rather than pity,\nthey were allowed to finish the mess. Then when they had risen Hamilcar\nwith a sign commanded the man who bore the sword-belt to speak. Spendius\nwas afraid; he stammered.\n\nHamilcar, while listening to him, kept turning round on his finger a\nbig gold ring, the same which had stamped the seal of Carthage upon the\nsword-belt. He let it fall to the ground; Spendius immediately picked it\nup; his servile habits came back to him in the presence of his master.\nThe others quivered with indignation at such baseness.\n\nBut the Greek raised his voice and spoke for a long time in rapid,\ninsidious, and even violent fashion, setting forth the crimes of Hanno,\nwhom he knew to be Barca's enemy, and striving to move Hamilcar's pity\nby the details of their miseries and the recollection of their devotion;\nin the end he became forgetful of himself, being carried away by the\nwarmth of his temper.\n\nHamilcar replied that he accepted their excuses. Peace, then, was about\nto be concluded, and now it would be a definitive one! But he required\nthat ten Mercenaries, chosen by himself, should be delivered up to him\nwithout weapons or tunics.\n\nThey had not expected such clemency; Spendius exclaimed: \"Ah! twenty if\nyou wish, master!\"\n\n\"No! ten will suffice,\" replied Hamilcar quietly.\n\nThey were sent out of the tent to deliberate. As soon as they were\nalone, Autaritus protested against the sacrifice of their companions,\nand Zarxas said to Spendius:\n\n\"Why did you not kill him? his sword was there beside you!\"\n\n\"Him!\" said Spendius. \"Him! him!\" he repeated several times, as though\nthe thing had been impossible, and Hamilcar were an immortal.\n\nThey were so overwhelmed with weariness that they stretched themselves\non their backs on the ground, not knowing at what resolution to arrive.\n\nSpendius urged them to yield. At last they consented, and went in again.\n\nThen the Suffet put his hand into the hands of the ten Barbarians in\nturn, and pressed their thumbs; then he rubbed it on his garment, for\ntheir viscous skin gave a rude, soft impression to the touch, a greasy\ntingling which induced horripilation. Afterwards he said to them:\n\n\"You are really all the chiefs of the Barbarians, and you have sworn for\nthem?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" they replied.\n\n\"Without constraint, from the bottom of your souls, with the intention\nof fulfilling your promises?\"\n\nThey assured him that they were returning to the rest in order to fulfil\nthem.\n\n\"Well!\" rejoined the Suffet, \"in accordance with the convention\nconcluded between myself, Barca, and the ambassadors of the Mercenaries,\nit is you whom I choose and shall keep!\"\n\nSpendius fell swooning upon the mat. The Barbarians, as though\nabandoning him, pressed close together; and there was not a word, not a\ncomplaint.\n\nTheir companions, who were waiting for them, not seeing them return,\nbelieved themselves betrayed. The envoys had no doubt given themselves\nup to the Suffet.\n\nThey waited for two days longer; then on the morning of the third, their\nresolution was taken. With ropes, picks, and arrows, arranged like\nrungs between strips of canvas, they succeeded in scaling the rocks; and\nleaving the weakest, about three thousand in number, behind them, they\nbegan their march to rejoin the army at Tunis.\n\nAbove the gorge there stretched a meadow thinly sown with shrubs; the\nBarbarians devoured the buds. Afterwards they found a field of beans;\nand everything disappeared as though a cloud of grasshoppers had passed\nthat way. Three hours later they reached a second plateau bordered by a\nbelt of green hills.\n\nAmong the undulations of these hillocks, silvery sheaves shone at\nintervals from one another; the Barbarians, who were dazzled by the\nsun, could perceive confusedly below great black masses supporting them;\nthese rose, as though they were expanding. They were lances in towers on\nelephants terribly armed.\n\nBesides the spears on their breasts, the bodkin tusks, the brass plates\nwhich covered their sides, and the daggers fastened to their knee-caps,\nthey had at the extremity of their tusks a leathern bracelet, in\nwhich the handle of a broad cutlass was inserted; they had set out\nsimultaneously from the back part of the plain, and were advancing on\nboth sides in parallel lines.\n\nThe Barbarians were frozen with a nameless terror. They did not even try\nto flee. They already found themselves surrounded.\n\nThe elephants entered into this mass of men; and the spurs on their\nbreasts divided it, the lances on their tusks upturned it like\nploughshares; they cut, hewed, and hacked with the scythes on their\ntrunks; the towers, which were full of phalaricas, looked like volcanoes\non the march; nothing could be distinguished but a large heap, whereon\nhuman flesh, pieces of brass and blood made white spots, grey sheets\nand red fuses. The horrible animals dug out black furrows as they passed\nthrough the midst of it all.\n\nThe fiercest was driven by a Numidian who was crowned with a diadem of\nplumes. He hurled javelins with frightful quickness, giving at intervals\na long shrill whistle. The great beasts, docile as dogs, kept an eye on\nhim during the carnage.\n\nThe circle of them narrowed by degrees; the weakened Barbarians offered\nno resistance; the elephants were soon in the centre of the plain.\nThey lacked space; they thronged half-rearing together, and their tusks\nclashed against one another. Suddenly Narr' Havas quieted them, and\nwheeling round they trotted back to the hills.\n\nTwo syntagmata, however, had taken refuge on the right in a bend of\nground, had thrown away their arms, and were all kneeling with their\nfaces towards the Punic tents imploring mercy with uplifted arms.\n\nTheir legs and hands were tied; then when they were stretched on the\nground beside one another the elephants were brought back.\n\nTheir breasts cracked like boxes being forced; two were crushed at every\nstep; the big feet sank into the bodies with a motion of the haunches\nwhich made the elephants appear lame. They went on to the very end.\n\nThe level surface of the plain again became motionless. Night fell.\nHamilcar was delighting himself with the spectacle of his vengeance, but\nsuddenly he started.\n\nHe saw, and all saw, some more Barbarians six hundred paces to the\nleft on the summit of a peak! In fact four hundred of the stoutest\nMercenaries, Etruscans, Libyans, and Spartans had gained the heights at\nthe beginning, and had remained there in uncertainty until now. After\nthe massacre of their companions they resolved to make their way through\nthe Carthaginians; they were already descending in serried columns, in a\nmarvellous and formidable fashion.\n\nA herald was immediately despatched to them. The Suffet needed soldiers;\nhe received them unconditionally, so greatly did he admire their\nbravery. They could even, said the man of Carthage, come a little\nnearer, to a place, which he pointed out to them, where they would find\nprovisions.\n\nThe Barbarians ran thither and spent the night in eating. Then the\nCarthaginians broke into clamours against the Suffet's partiality for\nthe Mercenaries.\n\nDid he yield to these outbursts of insatiable hatred or was it a\nrefinement of treachery? The next day he came himself, without a sword\nand bare-headed, with an escort of Clinabarians, and announced to\nthem that having too many to feed he did not intend to keep them.\nNevertheless, as he wanted men and he knew of no means of selecting the\ngood ones, they were to fight together to the death; he would then admit\nthe conquerors into his own body-guard. This death was quite as good as\nanother;--and then moving his soldiers aside (for the Punic standards\nhid the horizon from the Mercenaries) he showed them the one hundred and\nninety-two elephants under Narr' Havas, forming a single straight line,\ntheir trunks brandishing broad steel blades like giant arms holding axes\nabove their heads.\n\nThe Barbarians looked at one another silently. It was not death that\nmade them turn pale, but the horrible compulsion to which they found\nthemselves reduced.\n\nThe community of their lives had brought about profound friendship among\nthese men. The camp, with most, took the place of their country; living\nwithout a family they transferred the needful tenderness to a companion,\nand they would fall asleep in the starlight side by side under the\nsame cloak. And then in their perpetual wanderings through all sorts of\ncountries, murders, and adventures, they had contracted affections, one\nfor the other, in which the stronger protected the younger in the midst\nof battles, helped him to cross precipices, sponged the sweat of fevers\nfrom his brow, and stole food for him, and the weaker, a child perhaps,\nwho had been picked up on the roadside, and had then become a Mercenary,\nrepaid this devotion by a thousand kindnesses.\n\nThey exchanged their necklaces and earrings, presents which they had\nmade to one another in former days, after great peril, or in hours of\nintoxication. All asked to die, and none would strike. A young fellow\nmight be seen here and there, saying to another whose beard was grey:\n\"No! no! you are more robust! you will avenge us, kill me!\" and the man\nwould reply: \"I have fewer years to live! Strike to the heart, and think\nno more about it!\" Brothers gazed on one another with clasped hands,\nand friend bade friend eternal farewells, standing and weeping upon his\nshoulder.\n\nThey threw off their cuirasses that the sword-points might be thrust in\nthe more quickly. Then there appeared the marks of the great blows which\nthey had received for Carthage, and which looked like inscriptions on\ncolumns.\n\nThey placed themselves in four equal ranks, after the fashion of\ngladiators, and began with timid engagements. Some had even bandaged\ntheir eyes, and their swords waved gently through the air like blind\nmen's sticks. The Carthaginians hooted, and shouted to them that they\nwere cowards. The Barbarians became animated, and soon the combat as\ngeneral, headlong, and terrible.\n\nSometimes two men all covered with blood would stop, fall into each\nother's arms, and die with mutual kisses. None drew back. They rushed\nupon the extended blades. Their delirium was so frenzied that the\nCarthaginians in the distance were afraid.\n\nAt last they stopped. Their breasts made a great hoarse noise, and\ntheir eyeballs could be seen through their long hair, which hung down\nas though it had come out of a purple bath. Several were turning round\nrapidly, like panthers wounded in the forehead. Others stood motionless\nlooking at a corpse at their feet; then they would suddenly tear their\nfaces with their nails, take their swords with both hands, and plunge\nthem into their own bodies.\n\nThere were still sixty left. They asked for drink. They were told by\nshouts to throw away their swords, and when they had done so water was\nbrought to them.\n\nWhile they were drinking, with their faces buried in the vases, sixty\nCarthaginians leaped upon them and killed them with stiletos in the\nback.\n\nHamilcar had done this to gratify the instincts of his army, and, by\nmeans of this treachery, to attach it to his own person.\n\nThe war, then, was ended; at least he believed that it was; Matho\nwould not resist; in his impatience the Suffet commanded an immediate\ndeparture.\n\nHis scouts came to tell him that a convoy had been descried, departing\ntowards the Lead Mountain. Hamilcar did not trouble himself about it.\nThe Mercenaries once annihilated, the Nomads would give him no further\ntrouble. The important matter was to take Tunis. He advanced by forced\nmarches upon it.\n\nHe had sent Narr' Havas to Carthage with the news of his victory; and\nthe King of the Numidians, proud of his success, visited Salammbo.\n\nShe received him in her gardens under a large sycamore tree, amid\npillows of yellow leather, and with Taanach beside her. Her face was\ncovered with a white scarf, which, passing over her mouth and forehead,\nallowed only her eyes to be seen; but her lips shone in the transparency\nof the tissue like the gems on her fingers, for Salammbo had both\nher hands wrapped up, and did not make a gesture during the whole\nconversation.\n\nNarr' Havas announced the defeat of the Barbarians to her. She thanked\nhim with a blessing for the services which he had rendered to her\nfather. Then he began to tell her about the whole campaign.\n\nThe doves on the palm trees around them cooed softly, and other birds\nfluttered amid the grass: ring-necked glareolas, Tartessus quails and\nPunic guinea-fowl. The garden, long uncultivated, had multiplied\nits verdure; coloquintidas mounted into the branches of cassias, the\nasclepias was scattered over fields of roses, all kinds of vegetation\nformed entwinings and bowers; and here and there, as in the woods,\nsun-rays, descending obliquely, marked the shadow of a leaf upon the\nground. Domestic animals, grown wild again, fled at the slightest noise.\nSometimes a gazelle might be seen trailing scattered peacocks' feathers\nafter its little black hoofs. The clamours of the distant town were lost\nin the murmuring of the waves. The sky was quite blue, and not a sail\nwas visible on the sea.\n\nNarr' Havas had ceased speaking; Salammbo was looking at him without\nreplying. He wore a linen robe with flowers painted on it, and with gold\nfringes at the hem; two silver arrows fastened his plaited hair at the\ntips of his ears; his right hand rested on a pike-staff adorned with\ncircles of electrum and tufts of hair.\n\nAs she watched him a crowd of dim thoughts absorbed her. This young man,\nwith his gentle voice and feminine figure, captivated her eyes by the\ngrace of his person, and seemed to her like an elder sister sent by the\nBaals to protect her. The recollection of Matho came upon her, nor did\nshe resist the desire to learn what had become of him.\n\nNarr' Havas replied that the Carthaginians were advancing towards Tunis\nto take it. In proportion as he set forth their chances of success and\nMatho's weaknesses, she seemed to rejoice in extraordinary hope. Her\nlips trembled, her breast panted. When he finally promised to kill him\nhimself, she exclaimed: \"Yes! kill him! It must be so!\"\n\nThe Numidian replied that he desired this death ardently, since he would\nbe her husband when the war was over.\n\nSalammbo started, and bent her head.\n\nBut Narr' Havas, pursuing the subject, compared his longings to flowers\nlanguishing for rain, or to lost travellers waiting for the day. He told\nher, further, that she was more beautiful than the moon, better than the\nwind of morning or than the face of a guest. He would bring for her from\nthe country of the Blacks things such as there were none in Carthage,\nand the apartments in their house should be sanded with gold dust.\n\nEvening fell, and odours of balsam were exhaled. For a long time they\nlooked at each other in silence, and Salammbo's eyes, in the depths of\nher long draperies, resembled two stars in the rift of a cloud. Before\nthe sun set he withdrew.\n\nThe Ancients felt themselves relieved of a great anxiety, when he\nleft Carthage. The people had received him with even more enthusiastic\nacclamations than on the first occasion. If Hamilcar and the King of the\nNumidians triumphed alone over the Mercenaries it would be impossible\nto resist them. To weaken Barca they therefore resolved to make the aged\nHanno, him whom they loved, a sharer in the deliverance of Carthage.\n\nHe proceeded immediately towards the western provinces, to take his\nvengeance in the very places which had witnessed his shame. But the\ninhabitants and the Barbarians were dead, hidden, or fled. Then his\nanger was vented upon the country. He burnt the ruins of the ruins, he\ndid not leave a single tree nor a blade of grass; the children and the\ninfirm, that were met with, were tortured; he gave the women to his\nsoldiers to be violated before they were slaughtered.\n\nOften, on the crests of the hills, black tents were struck as though\noverturned by the wind, and broad, brilliantly bordered discs, which\nwere recognised as being chariot-wheels, revolved with a plaintive sound\nas they gradually disappeared in the valleys. The tribes, which had\nabandoned the siege of Carthage, were wandering in this way through the\nprovinces, waiting for an opportunity, or for some victory to be gained\nby the Mercenaries, in order to return. But, whether from terror or\nfamine, they all took the roads to their native lands, and disappeared.\n\nHamilcar was not jealous of Hanno's successes. Nevertheless he was in\na hurry to end matters; he commanded him to fall back upon Tunis; and\nHanno, who loved his country, was under the walls of the town on the\nappointed day.\n\nFor its protection it had its aboriginal population, twelve thousand\nMercenaries, and, in addition, all the Eaters of Uncleanness, for\nlike Matho they were riveted to the horizon of Carthage, and plebs and\nschalischim gazed at its lofty walls from afar, looking back in thought\nto boundless enjoyments. With this harmony of hatred, resistance was\nbriskly organised. Leathern bottles were taken to make helmets; all the\npalm-trees in the gardens were cut down for lances; cisterns were dug;\nwhile for provisions they caught on the shores of the lake big white\nfish, fed on corpses and filth. Their ramparts, kept in ruins now by the\njealousy of Carthage, were so weak that they could be thrown down with a\npush of the shoulder. Matho stopped up the holes in them with the stones\nof the houses. It was the last struggle; he hoped for nothing, and yet\nhe told himself that fortune was fickle.\n\nAs the Carthaginians approached they noticed a man on the rampart who\ntowered over the battlements from his belt upwards. The arrows that\nflew about him seemed to frighten him no more than a swarm of swallows.\nExtraordinary to say, none of them touched him.\n\nHamilcar pitched his camp on the south side; Narr' Havas, to his right,\noccupied the plain of Rhades, and Hanno the shore of the lake; and the\nthree generals were to maintain their respective positions, so as all to\nattack the walls simultaneously.\n\nBut Hamilcar wished first to show the Mercenaries that he would punish\nthem like slaves. He had the ten ambassadors crucified beside one\nanother on a hillock in front of the town.\n\nAt the sight of this the besieged forsook the rampart.\n\nMatho had said to himself that if he could pass between the walls and\nNarr' Havas's tents with such rapidity that the Numidians had not time\nto come out, he could fall upon the rear of the Carthaginian infantry,\nwho would be caught between his division and those inside. He dashed out\nwith his veterans.\n\nNarr' Havas perceived him; he crossed the shore of the lake, and came\nto warn Hanno to dispatch men to Hamilcar's assistance. Did he believe\nBarca too weak to resist the Mercenaries? Was it a piece of treachery or\nfolly? No one could ever learn.\n\nHanno, desiring to humiliate his rival, did not hesitate. He shouted\norders to sound the trumpets, and his whole army rushed upon the\nBarbarians. The latter returned, and ran straight against the\nCarthaginians; they knocked them down, crushed them under their feet,\nand, driving them back in this way, reached the tent of Hanno, who was\nthen surrounded by thirty Carthaginians, the most illustrious of the\nAncients.\n\nHe appeared stupefied by their audacity; he called for his captains.\nEvery one thrust his fist under his throat, vociferating abuse. The\ncrowd pressed on; and those who had their hands on him could scarce\nretain their hold. However, he tried to whisper to them: \"I will gave\nyou whatever you want! I am rich! Save me!\" They dragged him along;\nheavy as he was his feet did not touch the ground. The Ancients had\nbeen carried off. His terror increased. \"You have beaten me! I am your\ncaptive! I will ransom myself! Listen to me, my friends!\" and borne\nalong by all those shoulders which were pressed against his sides, he\nrepeated: \"What are you going to do? What do you want? You can see that\nI am not obstanite! I have always been good-natured!\"\n\nA gigantic cross stood at the gate. The Barbarians howled: \"Here! here!\"\nBut he raised his voice still higher; and in the names of their gods he\ncalled upon them to lead him to the schalischim, because he wished to\nconfide to him something on which their safety depended.\n\nThey paused, some asserting that it was right to summon Matho. He was\nsent for.\n\nHanno fell upon the grass; and he saw around him other crosses also, as\nthough the torture by which he was about to perish had been multiplied\nbeforehand; he made efforts to convince himself that he was mistaken,\nthat there was only one, and even to believe that there were none at\nall. At last he was lifted up.\n\n\"Speak!\" said Matho.\n\nHe offered to give up Hamilcar; then they would enter Carthage and both\nbe kings.\n\nMatho withdrew, signing to the others to make haste. It was a stratagem,\nhe thought, to gain time.\n\nThe Barbarian was mistaken; Hanno was in an extremity when consideration\nis had to nothing, and, moreover, he so execrated Hamilcar that he\nwould have sacrificed him and all his soldiers on the slightest hope of\nsafety.\n\nThe Ancients were languishing on the ground at the foot of the crosses;\nropes had already been passed beneath their armpits. Then the old\nSuffet, understanding that he must die, wept.\n\nThey tore off the clothes that were still left on him--and the horror\nof his person appeared. Ulcers covered the nameless mass; the fat on his\nlegs hid the nails on his feet; from his fingers there hung what looked\nlike greenish strips; and the tears streaming through the tubercles on\nhis cheeks gave to his face an expression of frightful sadness, for\nthey seemed to take up more room than on another human face. His royal\nfillet, which was half unfastened, trailed with his white hair in the\ndust.\n\nThey thought that they had no ropes strong enough to haul him up to the\ntop of the cross, and they nailed him upon it, after the Punic fashion,\nbefore it was erected. But his pride awoke in his pain. He began to\noverwhelm them with abuse. He foamed and twisted like a marine monster\nbeing slaughtered on the shore, and predicted that they would all end\nmore horribly still, and that he would be avenged.\n\nHe was. On the other side of the town, whence there now escaped jets of\nflame with columns of smoke, the ambassadors from the Mercenaries were\nin their last throes.\n\nSome who had swooned at first had just revived in the freshness of the\nwind; but their chins still rested upon their breasts, and their bodies\nhad fallen somewhat, in spite of the nails in their arms, which were\nfastened higher than their heads; from their heels and hands blood\nfell in big, slow drops, as ripe fruit falls from the branches of a\ntree,--and Carthage, gulf, mountains, and plains all appeared to them\nto be revolving like an immense wheel; sometimes a cloud of dust, rising\nfrom the ground, enveloped them in its eddies; they burned with horrible\nthirst, their tongues curled in their mouths, and they felt an icy sweat\nflowing over them with their departing souls.\n\nNevertheless they had glimpses, at an infinite depth, of streets,\nmarching soldiers, and the swinging of swords; and the tumult of battle\nreached them dimly like the noise of the sea to shipwrecked men dying\non the masts of a ship. The Italiotes, who were sturdier than the rest,\nwere still shrieking. The Lacedaemonians were silent, with eyelids\nclosed; Zarxas, once so vigorous, was bending like a broken reed; the\nEthiopian beside him had his head thrown back over the arms of the\ncross; Autaritus was motionless, rolling his eyes; his great head of\nhair, caught in a cleft in the wood, fell straight upon his forehead,\nand his death-rattle seemed rather to be a roar of anger. As to\nSpendius, a strange courage had come to him; he despised life now in\nthe certainty which he possessed of an almost immediate and an eternal\nemancipation, and he awaited death with impassibility.\n\nAmid their swooning, they sometimes started at the brushing of feathers\npassing across their lips. Large wings swung shadows around them,\ncroakings sounded in the air; and as Spendius's cross was the highest,\nit was upon his that the first vulture alighted. Then he turned his face\ntowards Autaritus, and said slowly to him with an unaccountable smile:\n\n\"Do you remember the lions on the road to Sicca?\"\n\n\"They were our brothers!\" replied the Gaul, as he expired.\n\nThe Suffet, meanwhile, had bored through the walls and reached\nthe citadel. The smoke suddenly disappeared before a gust of wind,\ndiscovering the horizon as far as the walls of Carthage; he even thought\nthat he could distinguish people watching on the platform of Eschmoun;\nthen, bringing back his eyes, he perceived thirty crosses of extravagant\nsize on the shore of the Lake, to the left.\n\nIn fact, to render them still more frightful, they had been constructed\nwith tent-poles fastened end to end, and the thirty corpses of the\nAncients appeared high up in the sky. They had what looked like white\nbutterflies on their breasts; these were the feathers of the arrows\nwhich had been shot at them from below.\n\nA broad gold ribbon shone on the summit of the highest; it hung down\nto the shoulder, there being no arm on that side, and Hamilcar had some\ndifficulty in recognising Hanno. His spongy bones had given way under\nthe iron pins, portions of his limbs had come off, and nothing was left\non the cross but shapeless remains, like the fragments of animals that\nare hung up on huntsmen's doors.\n\nThe Suffet could not have known anything about it; the town in front of\nhim masked everything that was beyond and behind; and the captains who\nhad been successively sent to the two generals had not re-appeared. Then\nfugitives arrived with the tale of the rout, and the Punic army halted.\nThis catastrophe, falling upon them as it did in the midst of their\nvictory, stupefied them. Hamilcar's orders were no longer listened to.\n\nMatho took advantage of this to continue his ravages among the\nNumidians.\n\nHanno's camp having been overthrown, he had returned against them.\nThe elephants came out; but the Mercenaries advanced through the plain\nshaking about flaming firebrands, which they had plucked from the walls,\nand the great beasts, in fright, ran headlong into the gulf, where\nthey killed one another in their struggles, or were drowned beneath the\nweight of their cuirasses. Narr' Havas had already launched his cavalry;\nall threw themselves face downwards upon the ground; then, when the\nhorses were within three paces of them, they sprang beneath their\nbellies, ripped them open with dagger-strokes, and half the Numidians\nhad perished when Barca came up.\n\nThe exhausted Mercenaries could not withstand his troops. They retired\nin good order to the mountain of the Hot Springs. The Suffet was prudent\nenough not to pursue them. He directed his course to the mouths of the\nMacaras.\n\nTunis was his; but it was now nothing but a heap of smoking rubbish. The\nruins fell through the breaches in the walls to the centre of the plain;\nquite in the background, between the shores of the gulf, the corpses of\nthe elephants drifting before the wind conflicted, like an archipelago\nof black rocks floating on the water.\n\nNarr' Havas had drained his forests of these animals, taking young and\nold, male and female, to keep up the war, and the military force of\nhis kingdom could not repair the loss. The people who had seen them\nperishing at a distance were grieved at it; men lamented in the streets,\ncalling them by their names like deceased friends: \"Ah! the Invincible!\nthe Victory! the Thunderer! the Swallow!\" On the first day, too, there\nwas no talk except of the dead citizens. But on the morrow the tents of\nthe Mercenaries were seen on the mountain of the Hot Springs. Then\nso deep was the despair that many people, especially women, flung\nthemselves headlong from the top of the Acropolis.\n\nHamilcar's designs were not known. He lived alone in his tent with\nnone near him but a young boy, and no one ever ate with them, not even\nexcepting Narr' Havas. Nevertheless he showed great deference to the\nlatter after Hanno's defeat; but the king of the Numidians had too great\nan interest in becoming his son not to distrust him.\n\nThis inertness veiled skilful manoeuvres. Hamilcar seduced the heads of\nthe villages by all sorts of artifices; and the Mercenaries were hunted,\nrepulsed, and enclosed like wild beasts. As soon as they entered a wood,\nthe trees caught fire around them; when they drank of a spring it was\npoisoned; the caves in which they hid in order to sleep were walled up.\nTheir old accomplices, the populations who had hitherto defended them,\nnow pursued them; and they continually recognised Carthaginian armour in\nthese bands.\n\nMany had their faces consumed with red tetters; this, they thought, had\ncome to them through touching Hanno. Others imagined that it was because\nthey had eaten Salammbo's fishes, and far from repenting of it, they\ndreamed of even more abominable sacrileges, so that the abasement of\nthe Punic Gods might be still greater. They would fain have exterminated\nthem.\n\nIn this way they lingered for three months along the eastern coast, and\nthen behind the mountain of Selloum, and as far as the first sands of\nthe desert. They sought for a place of refuge, no matter where.\nUtica and Hippo-Zarytus alone had not betrayed them; but Hamilcar was\nencompassing these two towns. Then they went northwards at haphazard\nwithout even knowing the various routes. Their many miseries had\nconfused their understandings.\n\nThe only feeling left them was one of exasperation, which went on\ndeveloping; and one day they found themselves again in the gorges of\nCobus and once more before Carthage!\n\nThen the actions multiplied. Fortune remained equal; but both sides were\nso wearied that they would willingly have exchanged these skirmishes for\na great battle, provided that it were really the last.\n\nMatho was inclined to carry this proposal himself to the Suffet. One of\nhis Libyans devoted himself for the purpose. All were convinced as they\nsaw him depart that he would not return.\n\nHe returned the same evening.\n\nHamilcar accepted the challenge. The encounter should take place the\nfollowing day at sunrise, in the plain of Rhades.\n\nThe Mercenaries wished to know whether he had said anything more, and\nthe Libyan added:\n\n\"As I remained in his presence, he asked me what I was waiting for.\n'To be killed!' I replied. Then he rejoined: 'No! begone! that will be\nto-morrow with the rest.'\"\n\nThis generosity astonished the Barbarians; some were terrified by it,\nand Matho regretted that the emissary had not been killed.\n\nHe had still remaining three thousand Africans, twelve hundred\nGreeks, fifteen hundred Campanians, two hundred Iberians, four hundred\nEtruscans, five hundred Samnites, forty Gauls, and a troop of Naffurs,\nnomad bandits met with in the date region--in all seven thousand two\nhundred and nineteen soldiers, but not one complete syntagmata. They\nhad stopped up the holes in their cuirasses with the shoulder-blades of\nquadrupeds, and replaced their brass cothurni with worn sandals. Their\ngarments were weighted with copper or steel plates; their coats of\nmail hung in tatters about them, and scars appeared like purple threads\nthrough the hair on their arms and faces.\n\nThe wraiths of their dead companions came back to their souls and\nincreased their energy; they felt, in a confused way, that they were the\nministers of a god diffused in the hearts of the oppressed, and were the\npontiffs, so to speak, of universal vengeance! Then they were enraged\nwith grief at what was extravagant injustice, and above all by the sight\nof Carthage on the horizon. They swore an oath to fight for one another\nuntil death.\n\nThe beasts of burden were killed, and as much as possible was eaten so\nas to gain strength; afterwards they slept. Some prayed, turning towards\ndifferent constellations.\n\nThe Carthaginians arrived first in the plain. They rubbed the edges of\ntheir shields with oil to make the arrows glide off them easily; the\nfoot-soldiers who wore long hair took the precaution of cutting it on\nthe forehead; and Hamilcar ordered all bowls to be inverted from the\nfifth hour, knowing that it is disadvantageous to fight with the stomach\ntoo full. His army amounted to fourteen thousand men, or about double\nthe number of the Barbarians. Nevertheless, he had never felt such\nanxiety; if he succumbed it would mean the annihilation of the Republic,\nand he would perish on the cross; if, on the contrary, he triumphed, he\nwould reach Italy by way of the Pyrenees, the Gauls, and the Alps, and\nthe empire of the Barcas would become eternal. Twenty times during the\nnight he rose to inspect everything himself, down to the most trifling\ndetails. As to the Carthaginians, they were exasperated by their\nlengthened terror. Narr' Havas suspected the fidelity of his Numidians.\nMoreover, the Barbarians might vanquish them. A strange weakness had\ncome upon him; every moment he drank large cups of water.\n\nBut a man whom he did not know opened his tent and laid on the ground a\ncrown of rock-salt, adorned with hieratic designs formed with sulphur,\nand lozenges of mother-of-pearl; a marriage crown was sometimes sent to\na betrothed husband; it was a proof of love, a sort of invitation.\n\nNevertheless Hamilcar's daughter had no tenderness for Narr' Havas.\n\nThe recollection of Matho disturbed her in an intolerable manner; it\nseemed to her that the death of this man would unburden her thoughts,\njust as people to cure themselves of the bite of a viper crush it upon\nthe wound. The king of the Numidians was depending upon her; he awaited\nthe wedding with impatience, and, as it was to follow the victory,\nSalammbo made him this present to stimulate his courage. Then his\ndistress vanished, and he thought only of the happiness of possessing so\nbeautiful a woman.\n\nThe same vision had assailed Matho; but he cast it from him immediately,\nand his love, that he thus thrust back, was poured out upon his\ncompanions in arms. He cherished them like portions of his own person,\nof his hatred,--and he felt his spirit higher, and his arms stronger;\neverything that he was to accomplish appeared clearly before him. If\nsighs sometimes escaped him, it was because he was thinking of Spendius.\n\nHe drew up the Barbarians in six equal ranks. He posted the Etruscans\nin the centre, all being fastened to a bronze chain; the archers were\nbehind, and on the wings he distributed the Naffurs, who were mounted on\nshort-haired camels, covered with ostrich feathers.\n\nThe Suffet arranged the Carthaginians in similar order. He placed the\nClinabarians outside the infantry next to the velites, and the Numidians\nbeyond; when day appeared, both sides were thus in line face to face.\nAll gazed at each other from a distance, with round fierce eyes. There\nwas at first some hesitation; at last both armies moved.\n\nThe Barbarians advanced slowly so as not to become out of breath,\nbeating the ground with their feet; the centre of the Punic army formed\na convex curve. Then came the burst of a terrible shock, like the crash\nof two fleets in collision. The first rank of the Barbarians had quickly\nopened up, and the marksmen, hidden behind the others, discharged their\nbullets, arrows, and javelins. The curve of the Carthaginians, however,\nflattened by degrees, became quite straight, and then bent inwards; upon\nthis, the two sections of the velites drew together in parallel lines,\nlike the legs of a compass that is being closed. The Barbarians, who\nwere attacking the phalanx with fury, entered the gap; they were being\nlost; Matho checked them,--and while the Carthaginian wings continued\nto advance, he drew out the three inner ranks of his line; they soon\ncovered his flanks, and his army appeared in triple array.\n\nBut the Barbarians placed at the extremities were the weakest,\nespecially those on the left, who had exhausted their quivers, and the\ntroop of velites, which had at last come up against them, was cutting\nthem up greatly.\n\nMatho made them fall back. His right comprised Campanians, who were\narmed with axes; he hurled them against the Carthaginian left; the\ncentre attacked the enemy, and those at the other extremity, who were\nout of peril, kept the velites at a distance.\n\nThen Hamilcar divided his horsemen into squadrons, placed hoplites\nbetween them, and sent them against the Mercenaries.\n\nThose cone-shaped masses presented a front of horses, and their broader\nsides were filled and bristling with lances. The Barbarians found it\nimpossible to resist; the Greek foot-soldiers alone had brazen armour,\nall the rest had cutlasses on the end of poles, scythes taken from the\nfarms, or swords manufactured out of the fellies of wheels; the\nsoft blades were twisted by a blow, and while they were engaged in\nstraightening them under their heels, the Carthaginians massacred them\nright and left at their ease.\n\nBut the Etruscans, riveted to their chain, did not stir; those who were\ndead, being prevented from falling, formed an obstruction with their\ncorpses; and the great bronze line widened and contracted in turn, as\nsupple as a serpent, and as impregnable as a wall. The Barbarians would\ncome to re-form behind it, pant for a minute, and then set off again\nwith the fragments of their weapons in their hands.\n\nMany already had none left, and they leaped upon the Carthaginians,\nbiting their faces like dogs. The Gauls in their pride stripped\nthemselves of the sagum; they showed their great white bodies from a\ndistance, and they enlarged their wounds to terrify the enemy. The voice\nof the crier announcing the orders could no longer be heard in the\nmidst of the Punic syntagmata; their signals were being repeated by the\nstandards, which were raised above the dust, and every one was swept\naway in the swaying of the great mass that surrounded him.\n\nHamilcar commanded the Numidians to advance. But the Naffurs rushed to\nmeet them.\n\nClad in vast black robes, with a tuft of hair on the top of the skull,\nand a shield of rhinoceros leather, they wielded a steel which had no\nhandle, and which they held by a rope; and their camels, which bristled\nall over with feathers, uttered long, hoarse cluckings. Each blade fell\non a precise spot, then rose again with a smart stroke carrying off a\nlimb with it. The fierce beasts galloped through the syntagmata. Some,\nwhose legs were broken, went hopping along like wounded ostriches.\n\nThe Punic infantry turned in a body upon the Barbarians, and cut them\noff. Their maniples wheeled about at intervals from one another. The\nmore brilliant Carthaginian weapons encircled them like golden crowns;\nthere was a swarming movement in the centre, and the sun, striking down\nupon the points of the swords, made them glitter with white flickering\ngleams. However, files of Clinabarians lay stretched upon the plain;\nsome Mercenaries snatched away their armour, clothed themselves in it,\nand then returned to the fray. The deluded Carthaginians were several\ntimes entangled in their midst. They would stand stupidly motionless,\nor else would back, surge again, and triumphant shouts rising in the\ndistance seemed to drive them along like derelicts in a storm. Hamilcar\nwas growing desperate; all was about to perish beneath the genius of\nMatho and the invincible courage of the Mercenaries.\n\nBut a great noise of tabourines burst forth on the horizon. It was a\ncrowd of old men, sick persons, children of fifteen years of age, and\neven women, who, being unable to withstand their distress any longer,\nhad set out from Carthage, and, for the purpose of placing themselves\nunder the protection of something formidable, had taken from Hamilcar's\npalace the only elephant that the Republic now possessed,--that one,\nnamely, whose trunk had been cut off.\n\nThen it seemed to the Carthaginians that their country, forsaking its\nwalls, was coming to command them to die for her. They were seized with\nincreased fury, and the Numidians carried away all the rest.\n\nThe Barbarians had set themselves with their backs to a hillock in\nthe centre of the plain. They had no chance of conquering, or even of\nsurviving; but they were the best, the most intrepid, and the strongest.\n\nThe people from Carthage began to throw spits, larding-pins and hammers,\nover the heads of the Numidians; those whom consuls had feared died\nbeneath sticks hurled by women; the Punic populace was exterminating the\nMercenaries.\n\nThe latter had taken refuge on the top of the hill. Their circle closed\nup after every fresh breach; twice it descended to be immediately\nrepulsed with a shock; and the Carthaginians stretched forth their arms\npell-mell, thrusting their pikes between the legs of their companions,\nand raking at random before them. They slipped in the blood; the steep\nslope of the ground made the corpses roll to the bottom. The elephant,\nwhich was trying to climb the hillock, was up to its belly; it seemed to\nbe crawling over them with delight; and its shortened trunk, which was\nbroad at the extremity, rose from time to time like an enormous leech.\n\nThen all paused. The Carthaginians ground their teeth as they gazed at\nthe hill, where the Barbarians were standing.\n\nAt last they dashed at them abruptly, and the fight began again. The\nMercenaries would often let them approach, shouting to them that they\nwished to surrender; then, with frightful sneers, they would kill\nthemselves at a blow, and as the dead fell, the rest would mount upon\nthem to defend themselves. It was a kind of pyramid, which grew larger\nby degrees.\n\nSoon there were only fifty, then only twenty, only three, and lastly\nonly two--a Samnite armed with an axe, and Matho who still had his\nsword.\n\nThe Samnite with bent hams swept his axe alternately to the right and\nleft, at the same time warning Matho of the blows that were being aimed\nat him. \"Master, this way! that way! stoop down!\"\n\nMatho had lost his shoulder-pieces, his helmet, his cuirass; he was\ncompletely naked, and more livid than the dead, with his hair quite\nerect, and two patches of foam at the corners of his lips,--and his\nsword whirled so rapidly that it formed an aureola around him. A\nstone broke it near the guard; the Samnite was killed and the flood of\nCarthaginians closed in, they touched Matho. Then he raised both his\nempty hands towards heaven, closed his eyes, and, opening out his arms\nlike a man throwing himself from the summit of a promontory into the\nsea, hurled himself among the pikes.\n\nThey moved away before him. Several times he ran against the\nCarthaginians. But they always drew back and turned their weapons aside.\n\nHis foot struck against a sword. Matho tried to seize it. He felt\nhimself tied by the wrists and knees, and fell.\n\nNarr' Havas had been following him for some time, step by step, with one\nof the large nets used for capturing wild beasts, and, taking advantage\nof the moment when he stooped down, had involved him in it.\n\nThen he was fastened on the elephants with his four limbs forming a\ncross; and all those who were not wounded escorted him, and rushed with\ngreat tumult towards Carthage.\n\nThe news of the victory had arrived in some inexplicable way at the\nthird hour of the night; the clepsydra of Khamon had just completed the\nfifth as they reached Malqua; then Matho opened his eyes. There were so\nmany lights in the houses that the town appeared to be all in flames.\n\nAn immense clamour reached him dimly; and lying on his back he looked at\nthe stars.\n\nThen a door closed and he was wrapped in darkness.\n\nOn the morrow, at the same hour, the last of the men left in the Pass of\nthe Hatchet expired.\n\nOn the day that their companions had set out, some Zuaeces who were\nreturning had tumbled the rocks down, and had fed them for some time.\n\nThe Barbarians constantly expected to see Matho appear,--and from\ndiscouragement, from languor, and from the obstinacy of sick men who\nobject to change their situation, they would not leave the mountain;\nat last the provisions were exhausted and the Zuaeces went away. It was\nknown that they numbered scarcely more than thirteen hundred men, and\nthere was no need to employ soldiers to put an end to them.\n\nWild beasts, especially lions, had multiplied during the three years\nthat the war had lasted. Narr' Havas had held a great battue, and--after\ntying goats at intervals--had run upon them and so driven them towards\nthe Pass of the Hatchet;--and they were now all living in it when a man\narrived who had been sent by the Ancients to find out what there was\nleft of the Barbarians.\n\nLions and corpses were lying over the tract of the plain, and the dead\nwere mingled with clothes and armour. Nearly all had the face or an arm\nwanting; some appeared to be still intact; others were completely dried\nup, and their helmets were filled with powdery skulls; feet which had\nlost their flesh stood out straight from the knemides; skeletons still\nwore their cloaks; and bones, cleaned by the sun, made gleaming spots in\nthe midst of the sand.\n\nThe lions were resting with their breasts against the ground and both\npaws stretched out, winking their eyelids in the bright daylight, which\nwas heightened by the reflection from the white rocks. Others were\nseated on their hind-quarters and staring before them, or else were\nsleeping, rolled into a ball and half hidden by their great manes; they\nall looked well fed, tired, and dull. They were as motionless as the\nmountain and the dead. Night was falling; the sky was striped with broad\nred bands in the west.\n\nIn one of the heaps, which in an irregular fashion embossed the plain,\nsomething rose up vaguer than a spectre. Then one of the lions set\nhimself in motion, his monstrous form cutting a black shadow on the\nbackground of the purple sky, and when he was quite close to the man, he\nknocked him down with a single blow of his paw.\n\nThen, stretching himself flat upon him, he slowly drew out the entrails\nwith the edge of his teeth.\n\nAfterwards he opened his huge jaws, and for some minutes uttered a\nlengthened roar which was repeated by the echoes in the mountain, and\nwas finally lost in the solitude.\n\nSuddenly some small gravel rolled down from above. The rustling of rapid\nsteps was heard, and in the direction of the portcullis and of the gorge\nthere appeared pointed muzzles and straight ears, with gleaming, tawny\neyes. These were the jackals coming to eat what was left.\n\nThe Carthaginian, who was leaning over the top of the precipice to look,\nwent back again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMATHO\n\nThere were rejoicings at Carthage,--rejoicings deep, universal,\nextravagant, frantic; the holes of the ruins had been stopped up, the\nstatues of the gods had been repainted, the streets were strewn with\nmyrtle branches, incense smoked at the corners of the crossways, and the\nthrong on the terraces looked, in their variegated garments, like heaps\nof flowers blooming in the air.\n\nThe shouts of the water-carriers watering the pavement rose above the\ncontinual screaming of voices; slaves belonging to Hamilcar offered\nin his name roasted barley and pieces of raw meat; people accosted one\nanother, and embraced one another with tears; the Tyrian towns were\ntaken, the nomads dispersed, and all the Barbarians annihilated.\nThe Acropolis was hidden beneath coloured velaria; the beaks of the\ntriremes, drawn up in line outside the mole, shone like a dyke of\ndiamonds; everywhere there was a sense of the restoration of order, the\nbeginning of a new existence, and the diffusion of vast happiness: it\nwas the day of Salammbo's marriage with the King of the Numidians.\n\nOn the terrace of the temple of Khamon there were three long tables\nladen with gigantic plate, at which the priests, Ancients, and the rich\nwere to sit, and there was a fourth and higher one for Hamilcar, Narr'\nHavas, and Salammbo; for as she had saved her country by the restoration\nof the zaimph, the people turned her wedding day into a national\nrejoicing, and were waiting in the square below till she should appear.\n\nBut their impatience was excited by another and more acrid longing:\nMatho's death has been promised for the ceremony.\n\nIt had been proposed at first to flay him alive, to pour lead into his\nentrails, to kill him with hunger; he should be tied to a tree, and\nan ape behind him should strike him on the head with a stone; he had\noffended Tanith, and the cynocephaluses of Tanith should avenge her.\nOthers were of opinion that he should be led about on a dromedary after\nlinen wicks, dipped in oil, had been inserted in his body in several\nplaces;--and they took pleasure in the thought of the large animal\nwandering through the streets with this man writhing beneath the fires\nlike a candelabrum blown about by the wind.\n\nBut what citizens should be charged with his torture, and why disappoint\nthe rest? They would have liked a kind of death in which the whole\ntown might take part, in which every hand, every weapon, everything\nCarthaginian, to the very paving-stones in the streets and the waves in\nthe gulf, could rend him, and crush him, and annihilate him. Accordingly\nthe Ancients decided that he should go from his prison to the square of\nKhamon without any escort, and with his arms fastened to his back; it\nwas forbidden to strike him to the heart, in order that he might live\nthe longer; to put out his eyes, so that he might see the torture\nthrough; to hurl anything against his person, or to lay more than three\nfingers upon him at a time.\n\nAlthough he was not to appear until the end of the day, the people\nsometimes fancied that he could be seen, and the crowd would rush\ntowards the Acropolis, and empty the streets, to return with lengthened\nmurmurings. Some people had remained standing in the same place since\nthe day before, and they would call on one another from a distance and\nshow their nails which they had allowed to grow, the better to bury them\ninto his flesh. Others walked restlessly up and down; some were as pale\nas though they were awaiting their own execution.\n\nSuddenly lofty feather fans rose above the heads, behind the Mappalian\ndistrict. It was Salammbo leaving her palace; a sigh of relief found\nvent.\n\nBut the procession was long in coming; it marched with deliberation.\n\nFirst there filed past the priests of the Pataec Gods, then those of\nEschmoun, of Melkarth, and all the other colleges in succession, with\nthe same insignia, and in the same order as had been observed at the\ntime of the sacrifice. The pontiffs of Moloch passed with heads bent,\nand the multitude stood aside from them in a kind of remorse. But the\npriests of Rabbetna advanced with a proud step, and with lyres in their\nhands; the priestesses followed them in transparent robes of yellow\nor black, uttering cries like birds and writhing like vipers, or else\nwhirling round to the sound of flutes to imitate the dance of the stars,\nwhile their light garments wafted puffs of delicate scents through the\nstreets.\n\nThe Kedeschim, with painted eyelids, who symbolised the hermaphrodism of\nthe Divinity, received applause among these women, and, being perfumed\nand dressed like them, they resembled them in spite of their flat\nbreasts and narrower hips. Moreover, on this day the female principle\ndominated and confused all things; a mystic voluptuousness moved in the\nheavy air; the torches were already lighted in the depths of the sacred\nwoods; there was to be a great celebration there during the night; three\nvessels had brought courtesans from Sicily, and others had come from the\ndesert.\n\nAs the colleges arrived they ranged themselves in the courts of the\ntemples, on the outer galleries, and along double staircases which rose\nagainst the walls, and drew together at the top. Files of white robes\nappeared between the colonnades, and the architecture was peopled with\nhuman statues, motionless as statues of stone.\n\nThen came the masters of the exchequer, the governors of the provinces,\nand all the rich. A great tumult prevailed below. Adjacent streets were\ndischarging the crowd, hierodules were driving it back with blows of\nsticks; and then Salammbo appeared in a litter surmounted by a purple\ncanopy, and surrounded by the Ancients crowned with their golden tiaras.\n\nThereupon an immense shout arose; the cymbals and crotala sounded more\nloudly, the tabourines thundered, and the great purple canopy sank\nbetween the two pylons.\n\nIt appeared again on the first landing. Salammbo was walking slowly\nbeneath it; then she crossed the terrace to take her seat behind on a\nkind of throne cut out of the carapace of a tortoise. An ivory stool\nwith three steps was pushed beneath her feet; two Negro children knelt\non the edge of the first step, and sometimes she would rest both arms,\nwhich were laden with rings of excessive weight, upon their heads.\n\nFrom ankle to hip she was covered with a network of narrow meshes which\nwere in imitation of fish scales, and shone like mother-of-pearl; her\nwaist was clasped by a blue zone, which allowed her breasts to be\nseen through two crescent-shaped slashings; the nipples were hidden\nby carbuncle pendants. She had a headdress made of peacock's feathers\nstudded with gems; an ample cloak, as white as snow, fell behind\nher,--and with her elbows at her sides, her knees pressed together,\nand circles of diamonds on the upper part of her arms, she remained\nperfectly upright in a hieratic attitude.\n\nHer father and her husband were on two lower seats, Narr' Havas dressed\nin a light simar and wearing his crown of rock-salt, from which there\nstrayed two tresses of hair as twisted as the horns of Ammon; and\nHamilcar in a violet tunic figured with gold vine branches, and with a\nbattle-sword at his side.\n\nThe python of the temple of Eschmoun lay on the ground amid pools of\npink oil in the space enclosed by the tables, and, biting its tail,\ndescribed a large black circle. In the middle of the circle there was a\ncopper pillar bearing a crystal egg; and, as the sun shone upon it, rays\nwere emitted on every side.\n\nBehind Salammbo stretched the priests of Tanith in linen robes; on her\nright the Ancients, in their tiaras, formed a great gold line, and\non the other side the rich with their emerald sceptres a great green\nline,--while quite in the background, where the priests of Moloch were\nranged, the cloaks looked like a wall of purple. The other colleges\noccupied the lower terraces. The multitude obstructed the streets. It\nreached to the house-tops, and extended in long files to the summit of\nthe Acropolis. Having thus the people at her feet, the firmament\nabove her head, and around her the immensity of the sea, the gulf, the\nmountains, and the distant provinces, Salammbo in her splendour was\nblended with Tanith, and seemed the very genius of Carthage, and its\nembodied soul.\n\nThe feast was to last all night, and lamps with several branches were\nplanted like trees on the painted woollen cloths which covered the low\ntables. Large electrum flagons, blue glass amphoras, tortoise-shell\nspoons, and small round loaves were crowded between the double row of\npearl-bordered plates; bunches of grapes with their leaves had been\nrolled round ivory vine-stocks after the fashion of the thyrsus; blocks\nof snow were melting on ebony trays, and lemons, pomegranates, gourds,\nand watermelons formed hillocks beneath the lofty silver plate; boars\nwith open jaws were wallowing in the dust of spices; hares, covered with\ntheir fur, appeared to be bounding amid the flowers; there were shells\nfilled with forcemeat; the pastry had symbolic shapes; when the covers\nof the dishes were removed doves flew out.\n\nThe slaves, meanwhile, with tunics tucked up, were going about on\ntiptoe; from time to time a hymn sounded on the lyres, or a choir of\nvoices rose. The clamour of the people, continuous as the noise of\nthe sea, floated vaguely around the feast, and seemed to lull it in a\nbroader harmony; some recalled the banquet of the Mercenaries; they gave\nthemselves up to dreams of happiness; the sun was beginning to go down,\nand the crescent of the moon was already rising in another part of the\nsky.\n\nBut Salammbo turned her head as though some one had called her; the\npeople, who were watching her, followed the direction of her eyes.\n\nThe door of the dungeon, hewn in the rock at the foot of the temple, on\nthe summit of the Acropolis, had just opened; and a man was standing on\nthe threshold of this black hole.\n\nHe came forth bent double, with the scared look of fallow deer when\nsuddenly enlarged.\n\nThe light dazzled him; he stood motionless awhile. All had recognised\nhim, and they held their breath.\n\nIn their eyes the body of this victim was something peculiarly theirs,\nand was adorned with almost religious splendour. They bent forward to\nsee him, especially the women. They burned to gaze upon him who had\ncaused the deaths of their children and husbands; and from the bottom\nof their souls there sprang up in spite of themselves an infamous\ncuriosity, a desire to know him completely, a wish mingled with remorse\nwhich turned to increased execration.\n\nAt last he advanced; then the stupefaction of surprise disappeared.\nNumbers of arms were raised, and he was lost to sight.\n\nThe staircase of the Acropolis had sixty steps. He descended them as\nthough he were rolled down in a torrent from the top of a mountain;\nthree times he was seen to leap, and then he alighted below on his feet.\n\nHis shoulders were bleeding, his breast was panting with great shocks;\nand he made such efforts to burst his bonds that his arms, which were\ncrossed on his naked loins, swelled like pieces of a serpent.\n\nSeveral streets began in front of him, leading from the spot at which he\nfound himself. In each of them a triple row of bronze chains fastened to\nthe navels of the Pataec gods extended in parallel lines from one end\nto the other; the crowd was massed against the houses, and servants,\nbelonging to the Ancients, walked in the middle brandishing thongs.\n\nOne of them drove him forward with a great blow; Matho began to move.\n\nThey thrust their arms over the chains shouting out that the road had\nbeen left too wide for him; and he passed along, felt, pricked, and\nslashed by all those fingers; when he reached the end of one street\nanother appeared; several times he flung himself to one side to bite\nthem; they speedily dispersed, the chains held him back, and the crowd\nburst out laughing.\n\nA child rent his ear; a young girl, hiding the point of a spindle in her\nsleeve, split his cheek; they tore handfuls of hair from him and strips\nof flesh; others smeared his face with sponges steeped in filth and\nfastened upon sticks. A stream of blood started from the right side of\nhis neck, frenzy immediately set in. This last Barbarian was to them a\nrepresentative of all the Barbarians, and all the army; they were taking\nvengeance on him for their disasters, their terrors, and their shame.\nThe rage of the mob developed with its gratification; the curving chains\nwere over-strained, and were on the point of breaking; the people did\nnot feel the blows of the slaves who struck at them to drive them back;\nsome clung to the projections of the houses; all the openings in the\nwalls were stopped up with heads; and they howled at him the mischief\nthat they could not inflict upon him.\n\nIt was atrocious, filthy abuse mingled with ironical encouragements and\nimprecations; and, his present tortures not being enough for them, they\nforetold to him others that should be still more terrible in eternity.\n\nThis vast baying filled Carthage with stupid continuity. Frequently\na single syllable--a hoarse, deep, and frantic intonation--would be\nrepeated for several minutes by the entire people. The walls would\nvibrate with it from top to bottom, and both sides of the street would\nseem to Matho to be coming against him, and carrying him off the ground,\nlike two immense arms stifling him in the air.\n\nNevertheless he remembered that he had experienced something like it\nbefore. The same crowd was on the terraces, there were the same looks\nand the same wrath; but then he had walked free, all had then dispersed,\nfor a god covered him;--and the recollection of this, gaining precision\nby degrees, brought a crushing sadness upon him. Shadows passed before\nhis eyes; the town whirled round in his head, his blood streamed from a\nwound in his hip, he felt that he was dying; his hams bent, and he sank\nquite gently upon the pavement.\n\nSome one went to the peristyle of the temple of Melkarth, took thence\nthe bar of a tripod, heated red hot in the coals, and, slipping it\nbeneath the first chain, pressed it against his wound. The flesh was\nseen to smoke; the hootings of the people drowned his voice; he was\nstanding again.\n\nSix paces further on, and he fell a third and again a fourth time; but\nsome new torture always made him rise. They discharged little drops of\nboiling oil through tubes at him; they strewed pieces of broken glass\nbeneath his feet; still he walked on. At the corner of the street of\nSatheb he leaned his back against the wall beneath the pent-house of a\nshop, and advanced no further.\n\nThe slaves of the Council struck him with their whips of hippopotamus\nleather, so furiously and long that the fringes of their tunics were\ndrenched with sweat. Matho appeared insensible; suddenly he started\noff and began to run at random, making a noise with his lips like one\nshivering with severe cold. He threaded the street of Boudes, and the\nstreet of Soepo, crossed the Green Market, and reached the square of\nKhamon.\n\nHe now belonged to the priests; the slaves had just dispersed the crowd,\nand there was more room. Matho gazed round him and his eyes encountered\nSalammbo.\n\nAt the first step that he had taken she had risen; then, as he\napproached, she had involuntarily advanced by degrees to the edge of the\nterrace; and soon all external things were blotted out, and she saw only\nMatho. Silence fell in her soul,--one of those abysses wherein the whole\nworld disappears beneath the pressure of a single thought, a memory, a\nlook. This man who was walking towards her attracted her.\n\nExcepting his eyes he had no appearance of humanity left; he was a long,\nperfectly red shape; his broken bonds hung down his thighs, but they\ncould not be distinguished from the tendons of his wrists, which were\nlaid quite bare; his mouth remained wide open; from his eye-sockets\nthere darted flames which seemed to rise up to his hair;--and the wretch\nstill walked on!\n\nHe reached the foot of the terrace. Salammbo was leaning over the\nbalustrade; those frightful eyeballs were scanning her, and there rose\nwithin her a consciousness of all that he had suffered for her. Although\nhe was in his death agony she could see him once more kneeling in his\ntent, encircling her waist with his arms, and stammering out gentle\nwords; she thirsted to feel them and hear them again; she did not want\nhim to die! At this moment Matho gave a great start; she was on the\npoint of shrieking aloud. He fell backwards and did not stir again.\n\nSalammbo was borne back, nearly swooning, to her throne by the priests\nwho flocked about her. They congratulated her; it was her work. All\nclapped their hands and stamped their feet, howling her name.\n\nA man darted upon the corpse. Although he had no beard he had the cloak\nof a priest of Moloch on his shoulder, and in his belt that species\nof knife which they employed for cutting up the sacred meat, and which\nterminated, at the end of the handle, in a golden spatula. He cleft\nMatho's breast with a single blow, then snatched out the heart and laid\nit upon the spoon; and Schahabarim, uplifting his arm, offered it to the\nsun.\n\nThe sun sank behind the waves; his rays fell like long arrows upon the\nred heart. As the beatings diminished the planet sank into the sea; and\nat the last palpitation it disappeared.\n\nThen from the gulf to the lagoon, and from the isthmus to the pharos, in\nall the streets, on all the houses, and on all the temples, there was\na single shout; sometimes it paused, to be again renewed; the buildings\nshook with it; Carthage was convulsed, as it were, in the spasm of\nTitanic joy and boundless hope.\n\nNarr' Havas, drunk with pride, passed his left arm beneath Salammbo's\nwaist in token of possession; and taking a gold patera in his right\nhand, he drank to the Genius of Carthage.\n\nSalammbo rose like her husband, with a cup in her hand, to drink\nalso. She fell down again with her head lying over the back of the\nthrone,--pale, stiff, with parted lips,--and her loosened hair hung to\nthe ground.\n\nThus died Hamilcar's daughter for having touched the mantle of Tanith.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Salammbo, by Gustave Flaubert\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SALAMMBO ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1290.txt or 1290.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/2\/9\/1290\/\n\nProduced by John Bickers and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":807,"split":"train"}
