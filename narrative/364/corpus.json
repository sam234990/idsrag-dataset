A sly monkey persuades the crab to trade the rice ball for a persimmon seed. The crab is at first upset, but when she plants and tends the seed a tree grows that supplies abundant fruit. The monkey agrees to climb the tree to pick the fruit for the crab, but gorges himself on the fruit rather than sharing it with the crab. When the crab protests, the monkey hurls hard, unripe fruit at her. The shock of being attacked causes the crab to give birth just before she dies.\nThe crab's children seek revenge on the monkey. With the help of several allies\u00e2\u0080\u0094a chestnut, an usu, a bee, and a cow pie\u00e2\u0080\u0094they go to the monkey's house. The chestnut hides himself on the monkey's hearth, the bee in the water pail, the cow pie on the dirt floor, and the usu on the roof. When the monkey returns home he tries to warm himself on the hearth, but the chestnut strikes the monkey so that he burns himself. When the monkey tries to cool his burns at the water bucket, the bee stings him. When the startled monkey tries to run out of the house, the cow pie moves and trips him and the usu falls from the roof, killing the monkey.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Battle of the Monkey & the Crab, by Anonymous\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The monkey seeing this, and wishing to get\nsomething that could be turned to good account at once, said:\n\"Pray, exchange that rice-cake for this persimmon-seed.\" The crab,\nwithout a word, gave up his cake, and took the persimmon-seed and\nplanted it. At once it sprung up, and soon became a tree so high\none had to look up at it. The tree was full of persimmons but the\ncrab had no means of climbing the tree. So he asked the monkey to\nclimb up and get the persimmons for him. The monkey got up on a\nlimb of the tree and began to eat the persimmons. The unripe\npersimmons he threw at the crab, but all the ripe and good ones\nhe put in his pouch. The crab under the tree thus got his shell\nbadly bruised and only by good luck escaped into his hole, where he\nlay distressed with pain and not able to get up. Now when the\nrelatives and household of the crab heard how matters stood they\nwere surprised and angry, and declared war and attacked the\nmonkey, who leading forth a numerous following bid defiance to the\nother party. The crabs, finding themselves unable to meet and\ncope with this force, became still more exasperated and enraged,\nand retreated into their hole, and held a council of war.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen came a rice-mortar, a pounder, a bee, and an egg, and together\nthey devised a deep-laid plot to be avenged.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFirst, they requested that peace be made with the crabs; and\nthus they induced the king of the monkeys to enter their hole\nunattended, and seated him on the hearth. The monkey not suspecting\nany plot, took the _hibashi_, or poker, to stir up the slumbering\nfire, when bang! went the egg, which was lying hidden in the ashes,\nand burned the monkey's arm. Surprised and alarmed he plunged his\narm into the pickle-tub in the kitchen to relieve the pain of the\nburn. Then the bee which was hidden near the tub stung him sharply\nin his face already wet with tears.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWithout waiting to brush off the bee and howling bitterly, he\nrushed for the back door: but just then some sea-weed entangled his\nlegs and made him slip. Then, down came the pounder tumbling on him\nfrom a shelf, and the mortar too came rolling down on him from the\nroof of the porch, and broke his back and so weakened him that he\nwas unable to rise up. Then out came the crabs in a crowd and\nbrandishing on high their pinchers they pinched the monkey to\npieces.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n_Printed by the Kobunsha in Tokyo, Japan_\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Battle of the Monkey & the Crab, by Anonymous\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BATTLE OF THE MONKEY & THE CRAB ***\n\n***** This file should be named 25021.txt or 25021.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/5\/0\/2\/25021\/\n\nProduced by Jacqueline Jeremy and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net (This file was\nproduced from images generously made available by The\nInternet Archive\/American Libraries.)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":364,"split":"train"}
