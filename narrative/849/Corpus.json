Valgerd, her mother, speaks about their shared grief over father Thorfinn's hard and unloving manner. In addition to the family's move from Sweden to Iceland, Gunl\u00f6d laments at having been forced to part with her dear childhood friend, the young man Gunnar, who has gone on Crusade in the Holy Land and who she has not seen in years.\nValgerd leaves the room and Gunnar unexpectedly enters, his ship having just arrived. Gunnar expresses his love and asks Gunl\u00f6d to return with him to Sweden. Gunl\u00f6d is coy but reveals that she secretly believes in the Christian god that her pagan father hates. Gunl\u00f6d is evidently torn between loyalty to her father, who is pagan, and her young Christian lover. Gunnar leaves the room before Valgerd returns, but says his ship will be waiting that night for her to make up her mind to go with him.\nThe night brings a terrible storm and with it Thorfinn's ship returns home from Norway. Thorfinn enters the house and in celebration he asks his daughter to drink from a horn of Odin, a pagan act. Gunl\u00f6d refuses, confessing that she is a Christian and not pagan. The proud Thorfinn is mortified and angry with his disloyal daughter. Meanwhile, a messenger enters and informs Thorfinn that a local council has banished him from Iceland for past deeds of theft and murder, he must leave at once or defend himself in combat. Thorfinn fights bravely outside the home while Gunl\u00f6d watches from the window. He defeats his enemies, but is mortally wounded and dies while seated on his throne surrounded by wife, daughter and Gunnar. Thorfinn's last words, \"Eternal.. Creating.. God\", show he has accepted the Christian religion and blessed the union of Gunl\u00f6d and Gunnar.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Plays: The Father; Countess Julie; The\nOutlaw; The Stronger, by August Strindberg\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The author has boldly thrown on the other the burden of\nmaintaining her share in the development of the action by pantomime,\nfacial expression, and an occasional laugh.\n\n\"The Outlaw,\" although inferior in construction to the others, is still\nplayed with success and is full of dignity and atmosphere. The important\npart it played in promoting the fortunes of the author lends to it an\nadded interest which fully justifies its inclusion in this volume.\n\n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\n\n     \"I tell you, you must have chaos in you, if you would give\n     birth to a dancing star.\"--Nietzsche.\n\nIn Stockholm, living almost as a recluse, August Strindberg is dreaming\nlife away. The dancing stars, sprung from the chaos of his being, shine\nwith an ever-increasing refulgence from the high-arched dome of dramatic\nliterature, but he no longer adds to their number. The constellation of\nthe Lion of the North is complete.\n\nAt sixty-three, worn by the emotional intensity of a life, into which\nhas been crowded the stress and storm of a universe, he sits at his\ndesk, every day transcribing to his diary a record of those mystical\nforces which he says regulate his life.\n\nBefore him lies a crucifix, Hardly as a symbol of sectarian faith,\nfor Strindberg is a Swedenborgian, but a fitting accompaniment,\nnevertheless, to a state of mind which he expresses in saying \"One gets\nmore and more humble the longer one lives, and in the shadow of death\nmany things look different.\" A softer light beams from those blue eyes,\nwhich, under that tossing crown of tawny hair flung high from a speaking\nforehead, in times past flashed defiance at every opposition. For him\nthe fierce, unyielding, never-ceasing, ever-pressing strife of mind\nand unrest of life is passing, an eddy in the tide has borne him into\nquieter waters, and if the hum of the world reaches his solitude, it no\nlonger rouses him to headlong action.\n\nSecure in his position as the foremost man of letters Sweden has\nproduced in modern times, the last representative of that distinguished\ngroup of Scandinavian writers which included Ibsen, Bjornson and\nBrandes, with a Continental reputation surpassing that of any one of\nthem, Strindberg well may be entitled to dream of the past.\n\nOne day when in the evolution of the drama Strindberg's technique shall\nhave served its purpose and like Ibsen's, be forced to give way before\nthe advance of younger artists, when his most radical views shall have\nbecome the commonplaces of pseudo-culture, the scientific psychologist\nwill take the man in hand and, from the minute record of his life,\nemotions, thoughts, fancies, speculations and nightmares, which he has\nembodied in autobiographical novels and that most remarkable perhaps\nof all his creations, abysmal in its pessimism, \"The Inferno,\" will be\ndrawn a true conception of the man.\n\nThat the individual will prove quite as interesting a study as his\nliterary work, even the briefest outline of Strindberg's life will\nsuggest.\n\nThe lack of harmony in his soul that has permeated his life and work\nwith theses and antitheses Strindberg tries to explain through heredity,\na by no means satisfying or complete solution for the motivation of\nhis frequently unusual conduct and exceptional temperamental qualities,\nwhich the abnormal psychologist is in the habit of associating with\nthat not inconsiderable group of cases in which the emotional and\ntemperamental characteristics of the opposite sex are dominant in the\nindividual. His ancestry has been traced back to the sixteenth\ncentury, when his father's family was of the titled aristocracy, later,\ngeneration after generation, becoming churchmen, although Strindberg's\nfather, Carl Oscar, undertook a commercial career. His mother, Ulrica\nEleanora Norling, was the daughter of a poor tailor, whom Strindberg's\nfather first met as a waitress in a hotel, and, falling in love with\nher, married, after she had borne him three children.\n\nAugust, christened Johann August, the fourth child, was born at\nStockholm, January 22, 1849, soon after his father had become a\nbankrupt. There was little light or cheer in the boy's home; the\nmisfortune that overtook the family at the time of August's birth always\nhung over them like a dark cloud; the mother became nervous and worn\nfrom the twelve child-births she survived, the father serious and\nreserved. The children were brought up strictly and as August was no\nfavorite, loneliness and hostility filled even his earliest years.\n\nHis first school days were spent among boys of the better class, who\nturned up their noses at his leather breeches and heavy boots. He was\ntaken away from that school and sent where there was a lower class of\nboys, whose leader he soon became, but in his studies he was far from\nprecocious, though not dull.\n\nAs he grew up the family fortunes bettered, and he attended a private\nschool patronized by cultivated and wealthy people. Mixing so with both\nclasses meant much in the development of the youth, and he began to\nrealize that he belonged to both and neither, felt homeless, torn in his\nsympathies and antipathies, plebian and aristocratic at the same time.\nIn his thirteenth year, his mother died, a loss for which his father\nwas apparently soon consoled, as in less than a year he married his\nhousekeeper. This was another blow to the boy, for he disliked the\nwoman, and there was soon war between them.\n\nAt fifteen he fell in love with it woman of thirty of very religious\ncharacter, and its this was a period of fervent belief with the youth\nhimself, she became an influence in his life for Home time, but one day\na young comrade asked him to luncheon at a cafe, and for the first time\nStrindberg partook of schnaps and ale with a hearty meal. This little\nluncheon was the event which broke up the melancholy introspection of\nhis youth and stirred him to activity.\n\nHe went to Upsala University for one term and then left, partly on\naccount of the lack of funds for books, and partly because the slow,\npedantic methods of learning were distasteful to his restless, active\nnature. He then became a school teacher; next interested in medical\nscience, which he studied energetically, until the realities of\nsuffering drove him from it. About this time, the same time, by the way,\nthat Ibsen's \"The League of Youth\" was being hissed down at Christiana,\nthe creative artist in Strindberg began to stir, and after six months\nmore of turmoil of soul, he turned to the stage as a possible solution,\nmaking his debut at the Dramatiska Theatre in 1869 in Bjornson's \"Mary\nStuart,\" in the part of a lord with one line to speak. After two months\nof no advancement he found courage to ask to be heard in one of the\nclassical roles he had been studying.\n\nThe director, tired from a long rehearsal, reluctantly consented to\nlisten to him, likewise, the bored company of actors. Strindberg went on\n\"to do or die,\" and was soon shouting like a revivalist, and made such\nit bad impression that he was advised to go to the dramatic school to\nstudy. He went home disgusted and heartsick, and, determined to take his\nlife, swallowed an opium pill which he had long been keeping for that\npurpose.\n\nHowever, it was not sufficiently powerful, and, a friend coming to see\nhim, he was persuaded to go out, and together they drowned his chagrin\nin an evening at it caf\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nThe day after was a memorable one, for it was Strindberg's birthday as\na dramatist. He was lying on a sofa at home, his body still hot from\nthe shame of his defeat--and wine, trying to figure out how he could\npersuade his stepmother to effect a reconciliation between him and his\nfather. He saw the scenes played as clearly as though on a stage, and\nwith his brain working at high pressure, in two hours had the scheme\nfor two acts of a comedy worked out. In four days it was\nfinished--Strindberg's first play! It was refused production, but he was\ncomplimented, and felt that his honor was saved.\n\nThe fever of writing took possession of him and within two months he had\nfinished two comedies, and a tragedy in verse called \"Hermione,\"\nwhich was later produced. Giving so much promise as a dramatist he\nwas persuaded to leave the stage and, unwilling of spirit, returned to\nUpsala in the spring of 1870, as he was advised that he would never be\nrecognized as a writer unless he had secured is university degree.\nThe means with which to continue his studies were derived from the two\nhundred crowns left him by his mother, which he now forced his father to\nallow him to use. Despite this, however, his fortunes often ran to the\nlowest ebb.\n\nOne day Strindberg announced that he had a one act play called \"In Rome\"\nto read to the \"Runa\" (Song) Club, a group of six students whom he had\ngotten together, and which was devoted exclusively to the reading of the\npoetry of its members. The play, based upon an incident in the life of\nThorvaldsen, was received enthusiastically by the \"Runa,\" and the\nrest of the night was spent in high talk of Strindberg's future over a\nchampagne supper in his honor given by one of the well-to-do members.\nThese days of homage and appreciation from this student group Strindberg\ncherishes as the happiest time in his life, but notwithstanding their\nworshipful attitude, he himself was full of doubts and misgivings about\nhis abilities.\n\nOne of these friends sent the manuscript of \"In Rome\" to the Dramatiska\nTheatre at Stockholm, where it was accepted and produced anonymously in\nAugust of the same year, 1870. Strindberg was present at the\npremiere and although it was well received, to him it was all a fine\noccasion--except the play! He was ashamed of his self-confession in it\nand fled before the final curtain. He soon finished another play, \"The\nOutlaw,\" which is included in the present volume. In this drama, which\nretains a high place among his plays, Strindberg shows for the first\ntime his lion's claw and in it began to speak with his own voice. It\nwas accepted by the Court Theatre at Stockholm for production during the\nnext autumn, that of 1871.\n\nAt the close of the summer, after a violent quarrel with his father,\nhe returned to the University in the hope of finding help from his\ncomrades. Arrived at Upsala, with just one crown, he found that many\nof his old and more prosperous friends were no longer there. Times were\nharder than ever.\n\nBut at last a gleam of hope came with the news that \"The Outlaw\" was\nactually to be produced. And his wildest dreams were then realized, for,\ndespite the unappreciative attitude of the critics toward this splendid\nViking piece, the King, Carl XV, after seeing the play, commanded\nStrindberg to appear before him. Strindberg regarded the summons as the\nperpetration of a practical joke, and only obeyed it after making sure\nby telegraph that it was not a hoax.\n\nStrindberg tells of the kindly old king standing with a big pipe in his\nhand as the young author strode between chamberlains and other court\ndignitaries into the royal presence.\n\nThe king, a grandson of Napoleon's marshal Bernadotte, and as a\nFrenchman on the throne of Sweden, diplomatic enough to desire at least\nthe appearance of being more Swedish than the Swedes, spoke of the\npleasure the ancient Viking spirit of \"The Outlaw\" had given him,\nand, after talking genially for some time, said, \"You are the son of\nStrindberg, the steamship agent, I believe and so, of course, are not in\nneed.\"\n\n\"Quite the reverse,\" Strindberg replied, explaining that his father no\nlonger gave him the meager help in his university course, which he had\nformerly done.\n\n\"How much can you get along on per annum until you graduate?\" asked the\nking.\n\nStrindberg was unable to say in a moment. \"I'm rather short of coin\nmyself,\" said the king quite frankly, \"but do you think you could manage\non eight hundred riksdaler a year?\" Strindberg was overwhelmed by such\nmunificence, and the interview was concluded by his introduction to the\ncourt treasurer, from whom he received his first quarter's allowance of\ntwo hundred crowns.\n\nFull of thankfulness for this unexpected turn of fate, the young\ndramatist returned to Upsala. For once he appeared satisfied with his\nlot, and took up his studies with more earnestness than ever. The year\n1871 closed brilliantly for the young writer, for in addition to the\nkingly favor be received honorable mention from the Swedish Academy\nfor his Greek drama \"Hermione.\" The following year, 1872, life at the\nuniversity again began to pall on his restless mind, and he took to\npainting.\n\nThen followed a serious disagreement with one of the professors, so that\nwhen he received word from the court treasurer that it was uncertain\nwhether his stipend could be continued on account of the death of the\nking, he decided to leave the University for good. At a farewell banquet\nin his honor, he expressed his appreciation of all he had received\nfrom his student friends, saying, \"A personality does not develop from\nitself, but out of each soul it comes in contact with, it sucks a drop,\njust as the bee gathers its honey from a million flowers giving it forth\neventually as its own.\"\n\nStrindberg went to Stockholm to become a literateur and, if possible,\na creative artist. He gleaned a living from newspaper work for a few\nmonths, but in the summer went to a fishing village on a remote island\nin Bothnia Bay where, in his twenty-third year, he wrote his great\nhistorical drama, \"Master Olof.\" Breaking away from traditions and\nmaking flesh and blood creations instead of historical skeletons in this\nplay, it was refused by all the managers of the theatres, who assured\nStrindberg that the public would not tolerate any such unfamiliar\nmethods. Strindberg protested, and defended and tried to elucidate his\nrealistic handling of the almost sacred historical personages, but in\nvain, for \"Master Olof\" was not produced until seven years later, when\nit was put on at the Swedish Theatre at Stockholm in 1880, the year\nIbsen was writing \"Ghosts\" at Sorrento.\n\nIn 1874, after a year or two of unsuccessful effort to make a living in\nvarious employments, he became assistant at the Court library, which was\nindeed a haven of refuge, a position providing both leisure for study\nand an assured income. Finding in the library some Chinese parchments\nwhich had not been catalogued; he plunged into the study of that\nlanguage. A treatise which he wrote on the subject won him medals from\nvarious learned societies at home, as well as recognition from the\nFrench Institute. This success induced the many other treatises that\nfollowed, for which he received a variety of decorations, and along with\nthe honors nearly brought upon himself \"a salubrious idiocy,\" to use his\nown phrase.\n\nThen something happened that stirred the old higher voice in him,--he\nfell in love. He had been invited through a woman friend to go to the\nhome of Baron Wrangel, where his name as an author was esteemed. He\nrefused the invitation, but the next day, walking in the city streets\nwith this same woman friend, they encountered the Baroness Wrangel to\nwhom Strindberg was introduced. The Baroness asked him once more to\ncome. He promised to do so, and they separated. As Strindberg's\nfriend went into a shop, he turned to look down the street; noting the\nbeautiful lines of the disappearing figure of the Baroness, noting, too,\na stray lock of her golden hair, that had escaped from her veil, and\nplayed against the white ruching at her throat. He gazed after her long,\nin fact, until she disappeared in the crowded street. From that moment\nhe was not a free man. The friendship which followed resulted in the\ndivorce of the Baroness from her husband and her marriage to Strindberg,\nDecember 30, 1877, when he was twenty-eight years old. At last\nStrindberg had someone to love, to take care of, to worship. This\nexperience of happiness, so strange to him, revived the creative\nimpulse.\n\nThe following year, 1878, \"Master Olof\" was finally accepted for\npublication, and won immediate praise and appreciation. This, to his\nmind, belated success, roused in Strindberg a smoldering resentment,\nwhich lack of confidence and authority of position had heretofore caused\nhim to repress. He broke out with a burning satire, in novel form,\ncalled \"The Red Room,\" the motto of which he made Voltaire's words \"Rien\nn'est si d\u00c3\u00a9sagr\u00c3\u00a9able que s'etre pendu obscur\u00c3\u00a9ment.\"\n\nHardly more than mention can be made of the important work of this\ndramatist, poet, novelist, historian, scientist and philosopher. In 1888\nhe left Sweden, as the atmosphere there had become too disagreeable for\nhim through controversy after controversy in which lie became involved.\nHe joined a group of painters and writers of all nationalities in it\nlittle village in France. There he wrote \"La France,\" setting forth the\nrelations between France and Sweden in olden times. This was published\nin Paris and the French government, tendered him the decoration of the\nlegion of honor which, however, he refused very politely, explaining\nthat he never wore a frock coat! The episode ends amusingly with the\npublisher, a Swede, receiving the decoration instead. In 1884 the first\nvolume of his famous short stories, called \"Marriages\" appeared. It\nwas aimed at the cult that had sprung up from Ibsen's \"A Doll's House,\"\nwhich was threatening the peace of all households. A few days after the\npublication of \"Marriages\" the first edition was literally swallowed up.\nAs the book dealt frankly with the physical facts of sex relations, it\nwas confiscated by the Swedish government a month after its publication,\nand Strindberg was obliged to go to Stockholm to defend his cause in the\ncourts, which he won, and in another month \"Marriages\" was again on the\nmarket.\n\nThe next year, 1885, his \"Real Utopias\" was written in Switzerland, an\nattack, in the form of four short stories, on over-civilization,\nwhich won him much applause in Germany. He went to Italy as a special\ncorrespondent for the \"Daily News\" of Stockholm.\n\nIn 1886 the much anticipated second volume of \"Marriages\" appeared.\nThese were the short stories, satisfying to the simplest as well as to\nthe most discriminating minds, that attracted Nietzsche's attention to\nStrindberg. A correspondence sprung up between the two men, referring to\nwhich in a letter to Peter Gast, Nietzsche said, \"Strindberg has\nwritten to me, and for the first time I sense an answering note of\nuniversality.\" The mutual admiration and intellectual sympathies of\nthese two conspicuous creative geniuses has led a number of critics,\nincluding Edmund Gosse, into the error of attributing to Nietzsche a\ndominating influence over Strindberg. It should be remembered, however,\nthe \"Countess Julie\" and \"The Father,\" which are cited its the most\nobvious examples of that supposed influence, were completed before\nStrindberg's acquaintance with Nietzsche's philosophy, and that among\nothers, the late John Davidson, is also charged with having drawn\nlargely from Nietzsche. The fact is, that, during the last quarter of\nthe nineteenth century, the most original thinkers of many countries\nwere quite independently, though less clearly, evolving the same\nphilosophic principals that the master mind of Nietzsche was radiating\nin the almost blinding flashes of his genius.\n\nThen came the period during which Strindberg attained the highest peaks\nof his work, the years 1886-90, with his autobiography, \"The Servant\nWoman's Son,\" the tragedies, \"The Father,\" and \"Countess Julie,\" the\ncomedies, \"Comrades,\" and \"The Stronger,\" and the tragi-comedies, \"The\nCreditors\" and \"Simoon.\" Of these, \"The Father\" and \"Countess Julie\"\nsoon made Strindberg's name known and honored throughout Europe, except\nin his home country.\n\nIn \"The Father\" perhaps his biggest vision is felt. It was published in\nFrench soon after it appeared in Sweden, with an introduction by Zola in\nwhich he says, \"To be brief, you have written a mighty and captivating\nwork. It is one of the few dramas that have had the power to stir me to\nthe depths.\"\n\nOf his choice of theme in \"Countess Julie,\" Strindberg says: \"When I\ntook this motive from life, as it was related to me a few years ago, it\nmade a strong impression on me. I found it suitable for tragedy, and it\nstill makes a sorrowful impression on me to see an individual to whom\nhappiness has been allotted go under, much more, to see a line become\nextinct.\" And in defence of his realism he has said further in his\npreface to \"Countess Julie\": \"The theatre has for a long time seemed to\nme the Biblia pauperum in the fine arts, a bible with pictures for those\nwho can neither read nor write, and the dramatist is the revivalist,\nand the revivalist dishes tap the ideas of the day in popular form,\nso popular that the middle class, of whom the bulk of theatre-goers is\ncomprised, can without burdening their brains understand what it is all\nabout. The theatre therefore has always been a grammar school for the\nyoung, the half-educated, and women, who still possess the primitive\npower of being able to delude themselves and of allowing themselves to\nbe deluded, that is to say, receive illusions and accept suggestions\nfrom the dramatist. *** Some people have accused my tragedy, 'The\nFather' of being too sad, as though one desired a merry tragedy. People\ncall authoritatively for the 'Joy of Life' and theatrical managers\ncall for farces, as though the Joy of Life lay in being foolish, and in\ndescribing people who each and every one are suffering from St. Vitus'\ndance or idiocy. I find the joy of life in the powerful, terrible\nstruggles of life; and the capability of experiencing something, of\nlearning something, is a pleasure to me. And therefore I have chosen\nan unusual but instructive subject; in other words, an exception, but a\ngreat exception, that will strengthen the rules which offend the apostle\nof the commonplace. What will further create antipathy in some, is the\nfact that my plan of action is not simple, and that there is not one\nview alone to be taken of it. An event in life--and that is rather a new\ndiscovery--is usually occasioned by a series of more or less deep-seated\nmotifs, but the spectator generally chooses that one which his power of\njudgment finds simplest to grasp, or that his gift of judgment\nconsiders the most honorable. For example, someone commits suicide: 'Bad\nbusiness!' says the citizen; 'Unhappy love!' says the woman; 'Sickness!'\nsays the sick man; 'Disappointed hopes?' the bankrupt. But it may be\nthat none of these reasons is the real one, and that the dead man hid\nthe real one by pretending another that would throw the most favorable\nlight on his memory. *** In the following drama ('Julie') I have not\nsought to do anything new, because that cannot be done, but only to\nmodernize the form according to the requirements I have considered\npresent-day people require.\"\n\nFollowing the mighty output, of those years, in 1891 Strindberg went\nout: to the islands where he had lived years before, and led a hermit's\nlife. Many of his romantic plays were written there, and much of his\ntime was spent at painting.\n\nIn 1892 he was divorced from his wife.\n\nAfter a few months Strindberg went to Berlin, where he was received with\nall honors by literary Germany. Richard Dehmel, one of their foremost\nminstrels, celebrated the event by a poem called \"An Immortal,--To\nGermany's Guest.\" In the shop windows his picture hung alongside that of\nBismarck, and at the theatres his plays were being produced. About this\ntime he heard of the commotion that \"Countess Julie\" had created in\nParis, where it had been produced by Antoine. During these victorious\ntimes Strindberg met a young Austrian writer, Frida Uhl, to whom he was\nmarried in April 1898. Although the literary giant of the hour, he was\nnevertheless in very straightened pecuniary circumstances, which led\nto his allowing the publication of \"A Fool's Confession,\" written in\nFrench, and later, with out his permission or knowledge, issued in\nGerman and Swedish, which entangled him in a lawsuit, as the subject\nmatter contained much of his marital miseries. Interest in chemistry had\nlong been stirring in Strindberg's mind; it now began to deepen. About\nthis time also he passed through that religious crisis which swept\nartistic Europe, awakened nearly a century after his death by that\nSwedenborgian poet and artist, William Blake. To this period belongs\n\"To Damascus,\" a play of deepest soul probing, which was not finished\nhowever until 1904.\n\nGoing to Paris in the fall of 1894, to pursue chemical research most\nseriously, he ran into his own success at the theatres there. \"The\nCreditors\" had been produced and Strindberg was induced to undertake\nthe direction of \"The Father\" at the Theatre de l'Oeuvre, where it was\na tremendous success. A Norwegian correspondent was forced to send word\nhome that with \"The Father\" Strindberg had overreached Ibsen in Paris,\nbecause what it had never been possible to do with an Ibsen play, have a\nrun in Paris, they were now doing with Strindberg. At the same time the\nThe\u00c3\u00a2tre des Ecaliers put on \"The Link,\" the Odean produced \"The Secret\nof the Guild,\" and the Chat Noir \"The Kings of Heaven,\" and translations\nof his novels were running in French periodicals. But Strindberg turned\nhis back on all this success and shut himself up in his laboratory to\ndelve into chemistry. This he did with such earnestness that with his\ndiscovery of Swedenborg his experimentations and speculations\nreduced him to a condition of mind that unfitted him for any kind of\ncompanionship, so that when his wife left him to go to their child who\nwas ill and far away, he welcomed the complete freedom. Strindberg says\nof their parting at the railway station that although they smiled and\nwaved to each other as they called out \"Auf wiedersehen\" they both knew\nthat they were saying good bye forever, which proved to be true, as they\nwere divorced a year later. In 1896 he returned to Sweden so broken in\nhealth through his tremendous wrestling with the riddle of life that he\nwent into the sanitorium of his friend, Dr. Aliasson at Wstad. After two\nmonths he was sufficiently restored to go to Austria, at the invitation\nof his divorced wife's family, to see his child. Then back to Sweden, to\nLund, a university town, where he lived solely to absorb Swedenborg. By\nMay of that year he was able to go to work on \"The Inferno,\" that record\nof a soul's nightmare, which in all probability will remain unique in\nthe history of literature. Then came the writing of the great historical\ndramas, then the realistically symbolic plays of Swedenborgian spirit,\nof which \"Easter\" is representative, and the most popular.\n\nWhen \"Easter\" was produced in Stockholm a young Norwegian, Harriet\nBosse, played Eleanora, the psychic, and in 1901 this young actress\nbecame Strindberg's wife. This third marriage ended in divorce three\nyears later. In 1906, the actor manager, August Folk, produced \"Countess\nJulie\" in Stockholm, seventeen years after it had been written. To\nStrindberg's amazement, it won such tremendous attention that the other\ntheatres became deserted. In consequence of this success an intimate\ntheatre was founded for the production of none but Strindberg's plays.\n\nHow he is estimated today in his own country may be judged by the\nfollowing extract from an article which appeared in a recent issue of\nthe leading periodical of Stockholm:\n\n\"For over thirty years he has dissected us from every point of view;\nduring that time his name has always been conspicuous in every book-shop\nwindow and his books gradually push out the others from our shelves;\nevery night his plays are produced at the theatres; every conversation\nturns on him, and his is the name the pigmies quarrel over daily; the\ncry is heard that he has become hysterical, sentimental, out of his\nmind, but the next one knows, he is robustness itself, and enduring\nbeyond belief, despite great need, enmity, sorrow. One hour one is angry\nover some extravagance which he has allowed himself, the next captivated\nby one of his plays, stirred, melted, strengthened and uplifted by his\nsublime genius.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE FATHER\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n     A CAPTAIN OF CAVALRY\n     LAURA, his wife\n     BERTHA, their daughter\n     DOCTOR OSTERMARK\n     THE PASTOR\n     THE NURSE\n     N\u00c3\u0096JD\n     AN ORDERLY\n\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\n[The sitting room at the Captain's. There is a door a little to the\nright at the back. In the middle of the room, a large, round table\nstrewn with newspapers and magazines. To right a leather-covered sofa\nand table. In the right-hand corner a private door. At left there is a\ndoor leading to the inner room and a desk with a clock on it. Gamebags,\nguns and other arms hang on the walls. Army coats hang near door at\nback. On the large table stands a lighted lamp.]\n\nCAPTAIN [rings, an orderly comes in.]\n\nORDERLY. Yes, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN. Is N\u00c3\u00b6jd out there?\n\nORDERLY. He is waiting for orders in the kitchen.\n\nCAPTAIN. In the kitchen again, is he? Send him in at once.\n\nORDERLY. Yes, Captain. [Goes.]\n\nPASTOR. What's the matter now?\n\nCAPTAIN. Oh the rascal has been cutting up with the servant-girl again;\nhe's certainly a bad lot.\n\nPASTOR. Why, N\u00c3\u00b6jd got into the same trouble year before last, didn't he?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, you remember? Won't you be good enough to give him a\nfriendly talking to and perhaps you can make some impression on him.\nI've sworn at him and flogged him, too, but it hasn't had the least\neffect.\n\nPASTOR. And so you want me to preach to him? What effect do you suppose\nthe word of God will have on a rough trooper?\n\nCAPTAIN. Well, it certainly has no effect on me.\n\nPASTOR. I know that well enough.\n\nCAPTAIN. Try it on him, anyway.\n\n[N\u00c3\u00b6jd comes in.]\n\nCAPTAIN. What have you been up to now, N\u00c3\u00b6jd?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. God save you, Captain, but I couldn't talk about it with the\nPastor here.\n\nPASTOR. Don't be afraid of me, my boy.\n\nCAPTAIN. You had better confess or you know what will happen.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Well, you see it was like this; we were at a dance at Gabriel's,\nand then--then Ludwig said--\n\nCAPTAIN. What has Ludwig got to do with it? Stick to the truth.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, and Emma said \"Let's go into the barn--\"\n\nCAPTAIN.--Oh, so it was Emma who led you astray, was it?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Well, not far from it. You know that unless the girl is willing\nnothing ever happens.\n\nCAPTAIN. Never mind all that: Are you the father of the child or not?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Who knows?\n\nCAPTAIN. What's that? Don't you know?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Why no--that is, you can never be sure.\n\nCAPTAIN. Weren't you the only one?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, that time, but you can't be sure for all that.\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you trying to put the blame on Ludwig? Is that what you are\nup to?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Well, you see it isn't easy to know who is to blame.\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, but you told Emma you would marry her.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Oh, a fellow's always got to say that--\n\nCAPTAIN [to Pastor.] This is terrible, isn't it?\n\nPASTOR. It's the old story over again. See here, N\u00c3\u00b6jd, you surely ought\nto know whether you are the father or not?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Well, of course I was mixed up with the girl--but you know\nyourself, Pastor, that it needn't amount to anything for all that.\n\nPASTOR. Look here, my lad, we are talking about you now. Surely you\nwon't leave the girl alone with the child. I suppose we can't compel you\nto marry her, but you should provide for the child--that you shall do!\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Well, then, so must Ludwig, too.\n\nCAPTAIN. Then the case must go to the courts. I cannot ferret out the\ntruth of all this, nor is it to my liking. So now be off.\n\nPASTOR. One moment, N\u00c3\u00b6jd. H'm--don't you think it dishonorable to leave\na girl destitute like that with her child? Don't you think so? Don't you\nsee that such conduct-- -- --h'm-- --h'm-- -- --\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, if I only knew for sure that I was father of the child, but\nyou can't be sure of that, Pastor, and I don't see much fun slaving all\nyour life for another man's child. Surely you, Pastor, and the Captain\ncan understand for yourselves.\n\nCAPTAIN. Be off.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. God save you, Captain. [Goes.]\n\nCAPTAIN. But keep out of the kitchen, you rascal! [To Pastor.] Now, why\ndidn't you get after him?\n\nPASTOR. What do you mean?\n\nCAPTAIN. Why, you only sat and mumbled something or other.\n\nPASTOR. To tell the truth I really don't know what to say. It is a pity\nabout the girl, yes, and a pity about the lad, too. For think if he\nwere not the father. The girl can nurse the child for four months at the\norphanage, and then it will be permanently provided for, but it will\nbe different for him. The girl can get a good place afterwards in\nsome respectable family, but the lad's future may be ruined if he is\ndismissed from the regiment.\n\nCAPTAIN. Upon my soul I should like to be in the magistrate's shoes and\njudge this case. The lad is probably not innocent, one can't be sure,\nbut we do know that the girl is guilty, if there is any guilt in the\nmatter.\n\nPASTOR. Well, well, I judge no one. But what were we talking about\nwhen this stupid business interrupted us? It was about Bertha and her\nconfirmation, wasn't it?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, but it was certainly not in particular about her\nconfirmation but about her whole welfare. This house is full of women\nwho all want to have their say about my child. My mother-in-law wants\nto make a Spiritualist of her. Laura wants her to be an artist; the\ngoverness wants her to be a Methodist, old Margret a Baptist, and the\nservant-girls want her to join the Salvation Army! It won't do to try to\nmake a soul in patches like that. I, who have the chief right to try to\nform her character, am constantly opposed in my efforts. And that's why\nI have decided to send her away from home.\n\nPASTOR. You have too many women trying to run this house.\n\nCAPTAIN. You're right! It's like going into a cage full of tigers, and\nif I didn't hold a red-hot iron under their noses they would tear me to\npieces any moment. And you laugh, you rascal! Wasn't it enough that I\nmarried your sister, without your palming off your old stepmother on me?\n\nPASTOR. But, good heavens, one can't have stepmothers in one's own\nhouse!\n\nCAPTAIN. No, you think it is better to have mothers-in-law in some one\nelse's house!\n\nPASTOR. Oh well, we all have some burden in life.\n\nCAPTAIN. But mine is certainly too heavy. I have my old nurse into the\nbargain, who treats me as if I ought still to wear a bib. She is a good\nold soul, to be sure, and she must not be dragged into such talk.\n\nPASTOR. You must keep a tight rein on the women folks. You let them run\nthings too much.\n\nCAPTAIN. Now will you please inform me how I'm to keep order among the\nwomen folk?\n\nPASTOR. Laura was brought up with a firm hand, but although she is my\nown sister, I must admit she _was_ pretty troublesome.\n\nCAPTAIN. Laura certainly has her faults, but with her it isn't so\nserious.\n\nPASTOR. Oh, speak out--I know her.\n\nCAPTAIN. She was brought up with romantic ideas, and it has been hard\nfor her to find herself, but she is my wife--\n\nPASTOR And because she is your wife she is the best of wives? No, my\ndear fellow, it is she who really wears on you most.\n\nCAPTAIN. Well, anyway, the whole house is topsy-turvy. Laura won't let\nBertha leave her, and I can't allow her to remain in this bedlam.\n\nPASTOR. Oh, so Laura won't? Well, then, I'm afraid you are in for\ntrouble. When she was a child if she set her mind on anything she used\nto play dead dog till she got it, and then likely as not she would give\nit back, explaining that it wasn't the thing she wanted, but having her\nown way.\n\nCAPTAIN. So she was like that even then? H'm--she really gets into such\na passion sometimes that I am anxious about her and afraid she is ill.\n\nPASTOR. But what do you want to do with Bertha that is so unpardonable?\nCan't you compromise?\n\nCAPTAIN. You mustn't think I want to make a prodigy of her or an image\nof myself. I don't want to be it procurer for my daughter and educate\nher exclusively for matrimony, for then if she were left unmarried she\nmight have bitter days. On the other hand, I don't want to influence her\ntoward a career that requires a long course of training which would be\nentirely thrown away if she should marry.\n\nPASTOR. What do you want, then?\n\nCAPTAIN. I want her to be it teacher. If she remains unmarried she will\nbe able to support herself, and at any rate she wouldn't be any worse\noff than the poor schoolmasters who have to share their salaries with a\nfamily. If she marries she can use her knowledge in the education of her\nchildren. Am I right?\n\nPASTOR. Quite right. But, on the other hand, hasn't she shown such\ntalent for painting that it would be a great pity to crush it?\n\nCAPTAIN. No! I have shown her sketches to an eminent painter, and he\nsays they are only the kind of thing that can be learned at schools. But\nthen a young fop came here in the summer who, of course, understands the\nmatter much better, and he declared that she had colossal genius, and so\nthat settled it to Laura's satisfaction.\n\nPASTOR. Was he quite taken with Bertha?\n\nCAPTAIN. That goes without saying.\n\nPASTOR. Then God help you, old man, for in that case I see no hope. This\nis pretty bad--and, of course, Laura has her supporters--in there?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, you may be sure of that; the whole house is already up in\narms, and, between ourselves, it is not exactly a noble conflict that is\nbeing waged from that quarter.\n\nPASTOR. Don't you think I know that?\n\nCAPTAIN. You do?\n\nPASTOR. I do.\n\nCAPTAIN. But the worst of it is, it strikes me that Bertha's future\nis being decided from spiteful motives. They hint that men better be\ncareful, because women can do this or that now-a-days. All day long,\nincessantly, it is a conflict between man and woman. Are you going? No,\nstay for supper. I have no special inducements to offer, but do stay.\nYou know I am expecting the new doctor. Have you seen him?\n\nPASTOR. I caught a glimpse of him as I came along. He looked pleasant,\nand reliable.\n\nCAPTAIN. That's good. Do you think it possible he may become my ally?\n\nPASTOR. Who can tell? It depends on how much he has been among women.\n\nCAPTAIN. But won't you really stay?\n\nPASTOR. No thanks, my dear fellow; I promised to be home for supper, and\nthe wife gets uneasy if I am late.\n\nCAPTAIN. Uneasy? Angry, you mean. Well, as you will. Let me help you\nwith your coat.\n\nPASTOR. It's certainly pretty cold tonight. Thanks. You must take care\nof your health, Adolf, you seem rather nervous.\n\nCAPTAIN. Nervous?\n\nPASTOR. Yes, you are not, really very well.\n\nCAPTAIN. Has Laura put that into your head? She has treated me for the\nlast twenty years as if I were at the point of death.\n\nPASTOR. Laura? No, but you make me uneasy about you. Take care of\nyourself--that's my advice! Good-bye, old man; but didn't you want to\ntalk about the confirmation?\n\nCAPTAIN. Not at all! I assure you that matter will have to take its\ncourse in the ordinary way at the cost of the clerical conscience for I\nam neither a believer nor a martyr.\n\nPASTOR. Good-bye. Love to Laura. [Goes.]\n\n[The Captain opens his desk and seats himself at it. Takes up account\nbooks.]\n\nCAPTAIN [Figuring.] Thirty-four--nine, forty-three--seven, eight,\nfifty-six--\n\nLAURA [Coming in from inner room.] Will you be kind enough--\n\nCAPTAIN. Just a moment! Sixty-six--seventy-one, eighty-four,\neighty-nine, ninety-two, a hundred. What is it?\n\nLAURA. Am I disturbing you?\n\nCAPTAIN. Not at all. Housekeeping money, I suppose?\n\nLAURA. Yes, housekeeping money.\n\nCAPTAIN. Put the accounts down there and I will go over them.\n\nLAURA. The accounts?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes.\n\nLAURA. Am I to keep accounts now?\n\nCAPTAIN. Of course you are to keep accounts. Our affairs are in a\nprecarious condition, and in case of a liquidation, accounts are\nnecessary, or one is liable to punishment for being careless.\n\nLAURA. It's not my fault that our affairs are in a precarious condition.\n\nCAPTAIN. That is exactly what the accounts will decide.\n\nLAURA. It's not my fault that our tenant doesn't pay.\n\nCAPTAIN. Who recommended this tenant so warmly? You! Why did you\nrecommend a--good-for-nothing, we'll call him?\n\nLAURA. But why did you rent to this good-for-nothing?\n\nCAPTAIN. Because I was not allowed to eat in peace, nor sleep in peace,\nnor work in peace, till you women got that man here. You wanted him so\nthat your brother might be rid of him, your mother wanted him because\nI didn't want him, the governess wanted him because he reads his Bible,\nand old Margret because she had known his grandmother from childhood.\nThat's why he was taken, and if he hadn't been taken, I'd be in a\nmadhouse by now or lying in my grave. However, here is the housekeeping\nmoney and your pin money. You may give me the accounts later.\n\nLAURA [Curtesies.] Thanks so much. Do you too keep an account of what\nyou spend besides the housekeeping money?\n\nCAPTAIN. That doesn't concern you.\n\nLAURA. No, that's true--just as little as my child's education\nconcerns me. Have the gentlemen come to a decision after this evening's\nconference?\n\nCAPTAIN. I had already come to a decision, and therefore it only\nremained for me to talk it over with the one friend I and the family\nhave in common. Bertha is to go to boarding school in town, and starts\nin a fortnight.\n\nLAURA. To which boarding school, if I may venture to ask?\n\nCAPTAIN. Professor S\u00c3\u00a4fberg's.\n\nLAURA. That free thinker!\n\nCAPTAIN. According to the law, children are to be brought up in their\nfather's faith.\n\nLAURA. And the mother has no voice in the matter?\n\nCAPTAIN. None whatever. She has sold her birthright by a legal\ntransaction, and forfeited her rights in return for the man's\nresponsibility of caring for her and her children.\n\nLAURA. That is to say she has no rights concerning her child.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, none at all. When once one has sold one's goods, one cannot\nhave them back and still keep the money.\n\nLAURA. But if both father and mother should agree?\n\nCAPTAIN. Do you think that could ever happen? I want her to live in\ntown, you want her to stay at home. The arithmetical result would be\nthat she remain at the railway station midway between train and home.\nThis is a knot that cannot be untied, you see.\n\nLAURA. Then it must be broken. What did N\u00c3\u00b6jd want here?\n\nCAPTAIN. That is an official secret.\n\nLAURA. Which the whole kitchen knows!\n\nCAPTAIN. Good, then you must know it.\n\nLAURA. I do know it.\n\nCAPTAIN. And have your judgment ready-made?\n\nLAURA. My judgment is the judgment of the law.\n\nCAPTAIN. But it is not written in the law who the child's father is.\n\nLAURA. No, but one usually knows that.\n\nCAPTAIN. Wise minds claim that one can never know.\n\nLAURA. That's strange. Can't one ever know who the father of a child is?\n\nCAPTAIN. No; so they claim.\n\nLAURA. How extraordinary! How can the father have such control over the\nchildren then?\n\nCAPTAIN. He has control only when he has assumed the responsibilities of\nthe child, or has had them forced upon him. But in wedlock, of course,\nthere is no doubt about the fatherhood.\n\nLAURA. There are no doubts then?\n\nCAPTAIN. Well, I should hope not.\n\nLAURA. But if the wife has been unfaithful?\n\nCAPTAIN. That's another matter. Was there anything else you wanted to\nsay?\n\nLAURA. Nothing.\n\nCAPTAIN. Then I shall go up to my room, and perhaps you will be kind\nenough to let me know when the doctor arrives. [Closes desk and rises]\n\nLAURA. Certainly.\n\n[Captain goes through the primate door right.]\n\nCAPTAIN. As soon as he comes. For I don't want to seem rude to him, you\nunderstand. [Goes.]\n\nLAURA. I understand. [Looks at the money she holds in her hands.]\n\nMOTHER-IN-LAW'S VOICE [Within.] Laura!\n\nLAURA. Yes.\n\nMOTHER-IN-LAW'S VOICE. Is my tea ready?\n\nLAURA [In doorway to inner room]. In just a moment.\n\n[Laura goes toward hall door at back as the orderly opens it.]\n\nORDERLY. Doctor Ostermark.\n\nDOCTOR. Madam!\n\nLAURA [Advances and offers her hand]. Welcome, Doctor--you are heartily\nwelcome. The Captain is out, but he will be back soon.\n\nDOCTOR. I hope you will excuse my coming so late, but I have already\nbeen called upon to pay some professional visits.\n\nLAURA. Sit down, won't you?\n\nDOCTOR. Thank you.\n\nLAURA. Yes, there is a great deal of illness in the neighborhood just\nnow, but I hope it will agree with you here. For us country people\nliving in such isolation it is of great value to find a doctor who\nis interested in his patients, and I hear so many nice things of you,\nDoctor, that I hope the pleasantest relations will exist between us.\n\nDOCTOR. You are indeed kind, and I hope for your sake my visits to you\nwill not often be caused by necessity. Your family is, I believe, as a\nrule in good health--\n\nLAURA. Fortunately we have bear spared acute illnesses, but still things\nare not altogether as they should be.\n\nDOCTOR. Indeed?\n\nLAURA. Heaven knows, things are not as might be wished.\n\nDOCTOR. Really, you alarm me.\n\nLAURA. There are some circumstances in a family which through honor and\nconscience one is forced to conceal from the whole world--\n\nDOCTOR. Excepting the doctor.\n\nLAURA. Exactly. It is, therefore, my painful duty to tell you the whole\ntruth immediately.\n\nDOCTOR. Shouldn't we postpone this conference until I have had the honor\nof being introduced to the Captain?\n\nLAURA. No! You must hear me before seeing him.\n\nDOCTOR. It relates to him then?\n\nLAURA. Yes, to him, my poor, dear husband.\n\nDOCTOR. You alarm me, indeed, and believe me, I sympathize with your\nmisfortune.\n\nLAURA [Taking out handkerchief]. My husband's mind is affected. Now you\nknow all, and may judge for yourself when you see him.\n\nDOCTOR. What do you say? I have read the Captain's excellent treatises\non mineralogy with admiration, and have found that they display a clear\nand powerful intellect.\n\nLAURA. Really? How happy I should be if we should all prove to be\nmistaken.\n\nDOCTOR. But of course it is possible that his mind might be affected in\nother directions.\n\nLAURA. That is just what we fear, too. You see he has sometimes the most\nextraordinary ideas which, of course, one might expect in a learned man,\nif they did not have a disastrous effect on the welfare of his whole\nfamily. For instance, one of his whims is buying all kinds of things.\n\nDOCTOR. That is serious; but what does he buy?\n\nLAURA. Whole boxes of books that he never reads.\n\nDOCTOR. There is nothing strange about a scholar's buying books.\n\nLAURA. You don't believe what I am saying?\n\nDOCTOR. Well, Madam, I am convinced that you believe what you are\nsaying.\n\nLAURA. Tell me, is it reasonable to think that one can see what is\nhappening on another planet by looking through a microscope?\n\nDOCTOR. Does he say he can do that?\n\nLAURA. Yes, that's what he says.\n\nDOCTOR. Through a microscope?\n\nLAURA. Through a microscope, yes.\n\nDOCTOR. This is serious, if it is so.\n\nLAURA. If it is so! Then you have no faith in me, Doctor, and here I sit\nconfiding the family secret to--\n\nDOCTOR. Indeed, Madam, I am honored by your confidence, but as a\nphysician I must investigate and observe before giving an opinion. Has\nthe Captain ever shown any symptoms of indecision or instability of\nwill?\n\nLAURA. Has he! We have been married twenty years, and he has never yet\nmade a decision without changing his mind afterward.\n\nDOCTOR. Is he obstinate?\n\nLAURA. He always insists on having his own way, but once he has got it\nhe drops the whole matter and asks me to decide.\n\nDOCTOR. This is serious, and demands close observation. The will, you\nsee, is the mainspring of the mind, and if it is affected the whole mind\ngoes to pieces.\n\nLAURA. God knows how I have taught myself to humor his wishes through\nall these long years of trial. Oh, if you knew what a life I have\nendured with him--if you only knew.\n\nDOCTOR. Your misfortune touches me deeply, and I promise you to see what\ncan be done. I pity you with all my heart, and I beg you to trust\nme completely. But after what I have heard I must ask you to avoid\nsuggesting any ideas that might make a deep impression on the patient,\nfor in a weak brain they develop rapidly and quickly turn to monomania\nor fixed ideas.\n\nLAURA. You mean to avoid arousing suspicions?\n\nDOCTOR. Exactly. One can make the insane believe anything, just because\nthey are receptive to everything.\n\nLAURA. Indeed? Then I understand. Yes--yes. [A bell rings within.]\nExcuse me, my mother wishes to speak to me. One moment-- --Ah, here is\nAdolf.\n\n[Captain comes in through private door.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Oh, here already, Doctor? You are very welcome.\n\nDOCTOR. Captain! It is a very great pleasure to me to make the\nacquaintance of so celebrated a man of science.\n\nCAPTAIN. Oh, I beg of you. The duties of service do not allow me to make\nany very profound investigations, but I believe I am now really on the\ntrack of a discovery.\n\nDOCTOR. Indeed?\n\nCAPTAIN. You see, I have submitted meteoric stones to spectrum analysis,\nwith the result that I have found carbon, that, is to say, a clear trace\nof organic life. What do you say to that?\n\nDOCTOR. Can you see that with it microscope?\n\nCAPTAIN. Lord, no--with the spectroscope.\n\nDOCTOR. The spectroscope! Pardon. Then you will soon be able to tell us\nwhat is happening on Jupiter.\n\nCAPTAIN. Not what is happening, but what has happened. If only the\nconfounded booksellers in Paris would send me the books; but I believe\nall the booksellers in the universe have conspired against me. Think\nof it, for the last two months not a single one has ever answered my\ncommunications, neither letters nor abusive telegrams. I shall go mad\nover it, and I can't imagine what's the matter.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, I suppose it's the usual carelessness; you mustn't let it\nvex you so.\n\nCAPTAIN. But the devil of it is I shall not get my treatise done in\ntime, and I know they are working along the same lines in Berlin. But we\nshouldn't be talking about this--but about you. If you care to live here\nwe have rooms for you in the wing, or perhaps you would rather live in\nthe old quarters?\n\nDOCTOR. Just as you like.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, as you like. Which is it to be?\n\nDOCTOR. You must decide that, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, it's not for me to decide. You must say which you prefer. I\nhave no preference in the matter, none at all.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, but I really cannot decide.\n\nCAPTAIN. For heaven's sake, Doctor, say which you prefer. I have no\nchoice in the matter, no opinion, no wishes. Haven't you got character\nenough to know what you want? Answer me, or I shall be provoked.\n\nDOCTOR. Well, if it rests with me, I prefer to live here.\n\nCAPTAIN. Thank you--forgive me, Doctor, but nothing annoys me so touch\nas to see people undecided about anything. [Nurse comes in.] Oh, there\nyou are, Margret. Do you happen to know whether the rooms in the wing\nare in order for the Doctor?\n\nNURSE. Yes, sir, they are.\n\nCAPTAIN. Very well. Then I won't detain you, Doctor; you must be tired.\nGood bye, and welcome once more. I shall see you tomorrow, I hope.\n\nDOCTOR. Good evening, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN. I daresay that my wife explained conditions here to you a\nlittle, so that you have some idea how the land lies?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, your excellent wife has given me a few hints about this and\nthat, such as were necessary to a stranger. Good evening, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN [To Nurse]. What do you want, you old dear? What is it?\n\nNURSE. Now, little Master Adolf, just listen--\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, Margret, you are the only one I can listen to without\nhaving spasms.\n\nNURSE. Now, listen, Mr. Adolf. Don't you think you should go half-way\nand come to an agreement with Mistress in this fuss over the child? Just\nthink of a mother--\n\nCAPTAIN. Think of a father, Margret.\n\nNURSE. There, there, there. A father has something besides his child,\nbut a mother has nothing but her child.\n\nCAPTAIN. Just so, you old dear. She has only one burden, but I have\nthree, and I have her burden too. Don't you think that I should hold a\nbetter position in the world than that of a poor soldier if I had not\nhad her and her child?\n\nNURSE. Well, that isn't what I wanted to talk about.\n\nCAPTAIN. I can well believe that, for you wanted to make it appear that\nI am in the wrong.\n\nNURSE. Don't you believe, Mr. Adolf, that I wish you well?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, dear friend, I do believe it; but you don't know what\nis for my good. You see it isn't enough for me to have given the child\nlife, I want to give her my soul, too.\n\nNURSE. Such things I don't understand. But I do think that you ought to\nbe able to agree.\n\nCAPTAIN. You are not my friend, Margret.\n\nNURSE. I? Oh, Lord, what are you saying, Mr. Adolf? Do you think I can\nforget that you were my child when you were little?\n\nCAPTAIN. Well, you dear, have I forgotten it? You have been like a\nmother to me, and always have stood by me when I had everybody against\nme, but now, when I really need you, you desert me and go over to the\nenemy.\n\nNURSE. The enemy!\n\nCAPTAIN, Yes, the enemy! You know well enough how things are in this\nhouse! You have seen everything from the beginning.\n\nNURSE. Indeed I have seen! But, God knows, why two people should torment\nthe life out of each other; two people who are otherwise so good and\nwish all others well. Mistress is never like that to me or to others--\n\nCAPTAIN. Only to me, I know it. But let me tell you, Margret, if you\ndesert me now, you will do wrong. For now they have begun to weave a\nplot against me, and that doctor is not my friend.\n\nNURSE. Oh, Mr. Adolf, you believe evil about everybody. But you see it's\nbecause you haven't the true faith; that's just what it is.\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, you and the Baptists have found the only true faith. You\nare indeed lucky!\n\nNURSE. Anyway, I'm not unhappy like you, Mr. Adolf. Humble your heart\nand you will see that God will make you happy in your love for your\nneighbor.\n\nCAPTAIN. It's a strange thing that you no sooner speak of God and love\nthan your voice becomes hard and your eyes fill with hate. No, Margret,\nsurely you have not the true faith.\n\nNURSE. Yes, go on being proud and hard in your learning, but it won't\namount to much when it comes to the test.\n\nCAPTAIN. How mightily you talk, humble heart. I know very well that\nknowledge is of no use to you women.\n\nNURSE. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. But in spite of everything\nold Margret cares most for her great big boy, and he will come back to\nthe fold when it's stormy weather.\n\nCAPTAIN. Margret! Forgive me, but believe me when I say that there is no\none here who wishes me well but you. Help me, for I feel that something\nis going to happen here. What it is, I don't know, but something evil is\non the way. [Scream from within.] What's that? Who's that screaming?\n\n[Berths enters from inner room.]\n\nBERTHA. Father! Father! Help me; save me.\n\nCAPTAIN. My dear child, what is it? Speak!\n\nBERTHA. Help me. She wants to hurt me.\n\nCAPTAIN. Who wants to hurt you? Tell me! Speak!\n\nBERTHA. Grandmother! But it's my fault for I deceived her.\n\nCAPTAIN. Tell me more.\n\nBERTHA. Yes, but you mustn't say anything about it. Promise me you\nwon't.\n\nCAPTAIN. Tell me what it is then.\n\n[Nurse goes.]\n\nBERTHA. In the evening she generally turns down the lamp and then she\nmakes me sit at a table holding a pen over a piece of paper. And then\nshe says that the spirits are to write.\n\nCAPTAIN. What's all this--and you have never told me about it?\n\nBERTHA. Forgive me, but I dared not, for Grandmother says the spirits\ntake revenge if one talks about them. And then the pen writes, but I\ndon't know whether I'm doing it or not. Sometimes it goes well, but\nsometimes it won't go at all, and when I am tired nothing comes, but\nshe wants it to come just the same. And tonight I thought I was writing\nbeautifully, but then grandmother said it was all from Stagnelius, and\nthat I had deceived her, and then she got terribly angry.\n\nCAPTAIN. Do you believe that there are spirits?\n\nBERTHA. I don't know.\n\nCAPTAIN. But I know that there are none.\n\nBERTHA. But Grandmother says that you don't understand, Father, and that\nyou do much worse things--you who can see to other planets.\n\nCAPTAIN. Does she say that! Does she say that? What else does she say?\n\nBERTHA. She says that you can't work witchery.\n\nCAPTAIN. I never said that I could. You know what meteoric stones\nare,--stones that fall from other heavenly bodies. I can examine them\nand learn whether they contain the same elements as our world. That is\nall I can tell.\n\nBERTHA. But Grandmother says that there are things that she can see\nwhich you cannot see.\n\nCAPTAIN. Then she lies.\n\nBERTHA. Grandmother doesn't tell lies.\n\nCAPTAIN. Why doesn't she?\n\nBERTHA. Then Mother tells lies too.\n\nCAPTAIN. H'm!\n\nBERTHA. And if you say that Mother lies, I can never believe in you\nagain.\n\nCAPTAIN. I have not said so; and so you must believe in me when I tell\nyou that it is for your future good that you should leave home. Will\nyou? Will you go to town and learn something useful?\n\nBERTHA. Oh, yes, I should love to go to town, away from here, anywhere.\nIf I can only see you sometimes--often. Oh, it is so gloomy and awful in\nthere all the time, like a winter night, but when you come home Father,\nit is like a morning in spring when they take off the double windows.\n\nCAPTAIN. My beloved child! My dear child!\n\nBERTHA. But, Father, you'll be good to Mother, won't you? She cries so\noften.\n\nCAPTAIN. H'm--then you want to go to town?\n\nBERTHA. Yes, yes.\n\nCAPTAIN. But if Mother doesn't want you to go?\n\nBERTHA. But she must let me.\n\nCAPTAIN. But if she won't?\n\nBERTHA. Well, then, I don't know what will happen. But she must! She\nmust!\n\nCAPTAIN. Will you ask her?\n\nBERTHA. You must ask her very nicely; she wouldn't pay any attention to\nmy asking.\n\nCAPTAIN. H'm! Now if you wish it, and I wish it, and she doesn't wish\nit, what shall we do then?\n\nBERTHA. Oh, then it will all be in a tangle again! Why can't you both--\n\n[Laura comes in.]\n\nLAURA. Oh, so Bertha is here. Then perhaps we may have her own opinion\nas the question of her future has to be decided.\n\nCAPTAIN. The child can hardly have any well-grounded opinion about what\na young girl's life is likely to be, while we, on the contrary, can more\neasily estimate what it may be, as we have seen so many young girls grow\nup.\n\nLAURA. But as we are of different opinions Bertha must be the one to\ndecide.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, I let no one usurp my rights, neither women nor children.\nBertha, leave us.\n\n[Bertha goes out.]\n\nLAURA. You were afraid of hearing her opinion, because you thought it\nwould be to my advantage.\n\nCAPTAIN. I know that she wishes to go away from home, but I know also\nthat you possess the power of changing her mind to suit your pleasure.\n\nLAURA. Oh, am I really so powerful?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, you have a fiendish power of getting your own way; but so\nhas anyone who does not scruple about, the way it is accomplished. How\ndid you get Doctor Norling away, for instance, and how did you get this\nnew doctor here?\n\nLAURA. Yes, how did I manage that?\n\nCAPTAIN. You insulted the other one so much that he left, and made your\nbrother recommend this fellow.\n\nLAURA. Well, that was quite simple and legitimate. Is Bertha to leave\nhome now?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, she is to start in a fortnight.\n\nLAURA. That is your decision?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes.\n\nLAURA. Then I must try to prevent it.\n\nCAPTAIN. You cannot.\n\nLAURA. Can't I? Do you really think I would trust my daughter to wicked\npeople to have her taught that everything her mother has implanted in\nher child is mere foolishness? Why, afterward, she would despise me all\nthe rest of her life!\n\nCAPTAIN. Do you think that a father should allow ignorant and conceited\nwomen to teach his daughter that he is a charlatan?\n\nLAURA. It means less to the father.\n\nCAPTAIN. Why so?\n\nLAURA. Because the mother is closer to the child, as it has been\ndiscovered that no one can tell for a certainty who the father of a\nchild is.\n\n\nCAPTAIN. How does that apply to this case?\n\nLAURA. You do not know whether you are Bertha's father or not.\n\nCAPTAIN. I do not know?\n\nLAURA. No; what no one knows, you surely cannot know.\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you joking?\n\nLAURA. No; I am only making use of your own teaching. For that matter,\nhow do you know that I have not been unfaithful to you?\n\nCAPTAIN. I believe you capable of almost anything, but not that, nor\nthat you would talk about it if it were true.\n\nLAURA. Suppose that I was prepared to bear anything, even to being\ndespised and driven out, everything for the sake of being able to keep\nand control my child, and that I am truthful now when I declare that\nBertha is my child, but not yours. Suppose--\n\nCAPTAIN. Stop now!\n\nLAURA. Just suppose this. In that case your power would be at an end.\n\nCAPTAIN. When you had proved that I was not the father.\n\nLAURA. That would not be difficult! Would you like me to do so?\n\nCAPTAIN. Stop!\n\nLAURA. Of course I should only need to declare the name of the real\nfather, give all details of place and time. For instance--when was\nBertha born? In the third year of our marriage.\n\nCAPTAIN. Stop now, or else--\n\nLAURA. Or else, what? Shall we stop now? Think carefully about all you\ndo and decide, and whatever you do, don't make yourself ridiculous.\n\nCAPTAIN. I consider all this most lamentable.\n\nLAURA. Which makes you all the more ridiculous.\n\nCAPTAIN. And you?\n\nLAURA. Oh, we women are really too clever.\n\nCAPTAIN. That's why one cannot contend with you.\n\nLAURA. Then why provoke contests with a superior enemy?\n\nCAPTAIN. Superior?\n\nLAURA. Yes, it's queer, but I have never looked at a man without knowing\nmyself to be his superior.\n\nCAPTAIN. Then you shall be made to see your superior for once, so that\nyou shall never forget it.\n\nLAURA. That will be interesting.\n\nNURSE [comes in]. Supper is served. Will you come in?\n\nLAURA. Very well.\n\n[Captain lingers; sits down with a magazine in an arm chair near table.]\n\nLAURA. Aren't you coming in to supper?\n\nCAPTAIN. No, thanks. I don't want anything.\n\nLAURA. What, are you annoyed?\n\nCAPTAIN. No, but I am not hungry.\n\nLAURA. Come, or they will ask unnecessary questions--be good now. You\nwon't? Stay there then. [Goes.]\n\nNURSE. Mr. Adolf! What is this all about?\n\nCAPTAIN. I don't know what it is. Can you explain to me why you women\ntreat an old man as if he were a child?\n\nNURSE. I don't understand it, but it must be because all you men, great\nand small, are women's children, every man of you.\n\nCAPTAIN. But no women are born of men. Yes, but I am Bertha's father.\nTell me, Margret, don't you believe it? Don't you?\n\nNURSE. Lord, how silly you are. Of course you are your own child's\nfather. Come and eat now, and don't sit there and sulk. There, there,\ncome now.\n\nCAPTAIN. Get out, woman. To hell with the hags. [Goes to private door.]\nSv\u00c3\u00a4rd, Sv\u00c3\u00a4rd!\n\n[Orderly comes in.]\n\nORDERLY. Yes, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN. Hitch into the covered sleigh at once.\n\nNURSE. Captain, listen to me.\n\nCAPTAIN. Out, woman! At once!\n\n[Orderly goes.]\n\nNURSE. Good Lord, what's going to happen now.\n\n[Captain puts on his cap and coat and prepares to go out.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Don't expect me home before midnight. [Goes.]\n\nNURSE. Lord preserve us, whatever will be the end of this!\n\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\n[The same scene as in previous act. A lighted lamp is on the table; it\nis night. The Doctor and Laura are discovered at rise of curtain.]\n\nDOCTOR. From what I gathered during my conversation with him the case is\nnot fully proved to me. In the first place you made a mistake in saying\nthat he had arrived at these astonishing results about other heavenly\nbodies by means of a microscope. Now that I have learned that it was a\nspectroscope, he is not only cleared of any suspicion of insanity, but\nhas rendered a great service to science.\n\nLAURA. Yes, but I never said that.\n\nDOCTOR. Madam, I made careful notes of our conversation, and I remember\nthat I asked about this very point because I thought I had misunderstood\nyou. One must be very careful in making such accusations when a\ncertificate in lunacy is in question.\n\nLAURA. A certificate in lunacy?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, you must surely know that an insane person loses both civil\nand family rights.\n\nLAURA. No, I did not know that.\n\nDOCTOR. There was another matter that seemed to me suspicious. He spoke\nof his communications to his booksellers not being answered. Permit me\nto ask if you, through motives of mistaken kindness, have intercepted\nthem?\n\nLAURA. Yes, I have. It was my duty to guard the interests of the family,\nand I could not let him ruin us all without some intervention.\n\nDOCTOR. Pardon me, but I think you cannot have considered the\nconsequences of such an act. If he discovers your secret interference\nin his affairs, he will have grounds for suspicions, and they will grow\nlike an avalanche. And besides, in doing this you have thwarted his will\nand irritated him still more. You must have felt yourself how the\nmind rebels when one's deepest desires are thwarted and one's will is\ncrossed.\n\nLAURA. Haven't I felt that!\n\nDOCTOR. Think, then, what he must have gone through.\n\nLAURA [Rising]. It is midnight and he hasn't come home. Now we may fear\nthe worst.\n\nDOCTOR. But tell me what actually happened this evening after I left. I\nmust know everything.\n\nLAURA. He raved in the wildest way and had the strangest ideas. For\ninstance, that he is not the father of his child.\n\nDOCTOR. That is strange. How did such an idea come into his head?\n\nLAURA. I really can't imagine, unless it was because he had to question\none of the men about supporting a child, and when I tried to defend the\ngirl, he grew excited and said no one could tell who was the father of\na child. God knows I did everything to calm him, but now I believe there\nis no help for him. [Cries.]\n\nDOCTOR. But this cannot go on. Something must be done here without, of\ncourse, arousing his suspicions. Tell me, has the Captain ever had such\ndelusions before?\n\nLAURA. Six years ago things were in the same state, and then he,\nhimself, confessed in his own letter to the doctor that he feared for\nhis reason.\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, yes, yes, this is a story that has deep roots and the\nsanctity of the family life--and so on--of course I cannot ask about\neverything, but must limit myself to appearances. What is done can't\nbe undone, more's the pity, yet the remedy should be based upon all the\npast.--Where do you think he is now?\n\nLAURA. I have no idea, he has such wild streaks.\n\nDOCTOR. Would you like to have me stay until he returns? To avoid\nsuspicion, I could say that I had come to see your mother who is not\nwell.\n\nLAURA. Yes, that will do very nicely. Don't leave us, Doctor; if you\nonly knew how troubled I am! But wouldn't it be better to tell him\noutright what you think of his condition.\n\nDOCTOR. We never do that unless the patient mentions the subject\nhimself, and very seldom even then. It depends entirely on the case. But\nwe mustn't sit here; perhaps I had better go into the next room; it will\nlook more natural.\n\nLAURA. Yes, that will be better, and Margret can sit here. She always\nwaits up when he is out, and she is the only one who has any power over\nhim. [Goes to the door left] Margret, Margret!\n\nNURSE. Yes, Ma'am. Has the master come home?\n\nLAURA. No; but you are to sit here and wait for him, and when he does\ncome you are to say my mother is ill and that's why the doctor is here.\n\nNURSE. Yes, yes. I'll see that everything is all right.\n\nLAURA [Opens the door to inner rooms]. Will you come in here, Doctor?\n\nDOCTOR. Thank you.\n\n[Nurse seats herself at the table and takes up a hymn book and\nspectacles and reads.]\n\nNURSE. Ah, yes, ah yes!                       [Reads half aloud]\n    Ah woe is me, how sad a thing\n    Is life within this vale of tears,\n  Death's angel triumphs like a king,\n    And calls aloud to all the spheres--        Vanity, all is vanity.\n    Yes, yes! Yes, yes!\n                       [Reads again]\n    All that on earth hath life and breath\n    To earth must fall before his spear,\n    And sorrow, saved alone from death,\n    Inscribes above the mighty bier.\n        Vanity, all is vanity.\n    Yes, Yes.\n\nBERTHA [Comes in with a coffee-pot and some embroidery. She speaks in a\nlow voice]. Margret, may I sit with you? It is so frightfully lonely up\nthere.\n\nNURSE. For goodness sake, are you still up, Bertha?\n\nBERTHA. You see I want to finish Father's Christmas present. And here's\nsomething that you'll like.\n\nNURSE. But bless my soul, this won't do. You must be up in the morning,\nand it's after midnight now.\n\nBERTHA. What does it matter? I don't dare sit up there alone. I believe\nthe spirits are at work.\n\nNURSE. You see, just what I've said. Mark my words, this house was not\nbuilt on a lucky spot. What did you hear?\n\nBERTHA. Think of it, I heard some one singing up in the attic!\n\nNURSE. In the attic? At this hour?\n\nBERTHA. Yes, it was such it sorrowful, melancholy song! I never heard\nanything like it. It sounded as if it came from the store-room, where\nthe cradle stands, you know, to the left-- -- --\n\nNURSE. Dear me, Dear me! And such a fearful night. It seems as if the\nchimneys would blow down. \"Ah, what is then this earthly life, But\ngrief, afliction and great strife? E'en when fairest it has seemed,\nNought but pain it can be deemed.\" Ah, dear child, may God give us a\ngood Christmas!\n\nBERTHA. Margret, is it true that Father is ill?\n\nNURSE. Yes, I'm afraid he is.\n\nBERTHA. Then we can't keep Christmas eve? But how can he be up and\naround if he is 111?\n\nNURSE. You see, my child, the kind of illness he has doesn't keep him\nfrom being up. Hush, there's some one out in the hall. Go to bed now and\ntake the coffee pot away or the master will be angry.\n\nBERTHA [Going out with tray]. Good night, Margret.\n\nNURSE. Good night, my child. God bless you.\n\n[Captain comes in, takes off his overcoat.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you still up? Go to bed.\n\nNURSE. I was only waiting till-- --\n\n[Captain lights a candle, opens his desk, sits down at it and takes\nletters and newspapers out of his pocket.]\n\nNURSE. Mr. Adolf.\n\nCAPTAIN. What do you want?\n\nNURSE. Old mistress is ill and the doctor is here.\n\nCAPTAIN. Is it anything dangerous?\n\nNURSE. No, I don't think so. Just a cold.\n\nCAPTAIN [Gets up]. Margret, who was the father of your child?\n\nNURSE. Oh, I've told you many and many a time; it was that scamp\nJohansson.\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you sure that it was he?\n\nNURSE. How childish you are; of course I'm sure when he was the only\none.\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, but was he sure that he was the only one? No, he could not\nbe, but you could be sure of it. There is a difference, you see.\n\nNURSE. Well, I can't see any difference.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, you cannot see it, but the difference exists, nevertheless.\n[Turns over the pages of a photograph album which is on the table.] Do\nyou think Bertha looks like me?\n\nNURSE. Of course! Why, you are as like as two peas.\n\nCAPTAIN. Did Johansson confess that he was the father?\n\nNURSE. He was forced to!\n\nCAPTAIN. How terrible! Here is the Doctor. [Doctor comes in.] Good\nevening, Doctor. How is my mother-in-law?\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, it's nothing serious; merely a slight sprain of the left\nankle.\n\nCAPTAIN. I thought Margret said it was a cold. There seem to be\ndifferent opinions about the same case. Go to bed, Margret.\n\n[Nurse goes. A pause.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Sit down, Doctor.\n\nDOCTOR [Sits]. Thanks.\n\nCAPTAIN. Is it true that you obtain striped foals if you cross a zebra\nand a mare?\n\nDOCTOR [Astonished]. Perfectly true.\n\nCAPTAIN. Is it true that the foals continue to be striped if the breed\nis continued with a stallion?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, that is true, too.\n\nCAPTAIN. That is to say, under certain conditions a stallion can be sire\nto striped foals or the opposite?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, so it seems.\n\nCAPTAIN. Therefore an offspring's likeness to the father proves nothing?\n\nDOCTOR. Well-- -- --\n\nCAPTAIN. That is to say, paternity cannot be proven.\n\nDOCTOR. H'm-- --well-- --\n\nCAPTAIN. You are a widower, aren't you, and have had children?\n\nDOCTOR. Ye-es.\n\nCAPTAIN. Didn't you ever feel ridiculous as a. father? I know of nothing\nso ludicrous as to see a father leading his children by the hand around\nthe streets, or to hear it father talk about his children. \"My wife's\nchildren,\" he ought to say. Did you ever feel how false your position\nwas? Weren't you ever afflicted with doubts, I won't say suspicions,\nfor, as a gentleman, I assume that your wife was above suspicion.\n\nDOCTOR. No, really, I never was; but, Captain, I believe Goethe says a\nman must take his children on good faith.\n\nCAPTAIN. It's risky to take anything on good faith where a woman is\nconcerned.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, there are so many kinds of women.\n\nCAPTAIN. Modern investigations have pronounced that there is only one\nkind! Lately I have recalled two instances in my life that make me\nbelieve this. When I was young I was strong and, if I may boast,\nhandsome. Once when I was making a trip on a steamer and sitting with a\nfew friends in the saloon, the young stewardess came and flung herself\ndown by me, burst into tears, and told us that her sweetheart was\ndrowned. We sympathized with her, and I ordered some champagne. After\nthe second glass I touched her foot; after the fourth her knee, and\nbefore morning I had consoled her.\n\nDOCTOR. That was just a winter fly.\n\nCAPTAIN. Now comes the second instance--and that was a real summer fly.\nI was at Lyskil. There was a young married woman stopping there with her\nchildren, but her husband was in town. She was religious, had extremely\nstrict principles, preached morals to me, and was, I believe, entirely\nhonorable. I lent her a book, two books, and when she was leaving, she\nreturned them, strange to say! Three months later, in those very books\nI found her card with a declaration on it. It was innocent, as innocent\nits it declaration of love can be from a married woman to a strange man\nwho never made any advances. Now comes the moral: Just don't have too\nmuch faith.\n\nDOCTOR. Don't have too little faith either.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, but just enough. But, you see, Doctor, that woman was so\nunconsciously dishonest that she talked to her husband about the\nfancy she had taken to me. That's what makes it dangerous, this very\nunconsciousness of their instinctive dishonesty. That is a mitigating\ncircumstance, I admit, but it cannot nullify judgment, only soften it.\n\nDOCTOR. Captain, your thoughts are taking a morbid turn, and you ought\nto control them.\n\nCAPTAIN. You must not use the word morbid. Steam boilers, as you know,\nexplode at it certain pressure, but the same pressure is not needed for\nall boiler explosions. You understand? However, you are here to watch\nme. If I were not a man I should have the right to make accusations or\ncomplaints, as they are so cleverly called, and perhaps I should be able\nto give you the whole diagnosis, and, what is more, the history of my\ndisease. But unfortunately, I am a man, and there is nothing for me to\ndo but, like a Roman, fold my arms across my breast and hold my breath\ntill I die.\n\nDOCTOR. Captain, if you are ill, it will not reflect upon your honor as\na man to tell me all. In fact, I ought to hear the other side.\n\nCAPTAIN. You have had enough in hearing the one, I imagine. Do you\nknow when I heard Mrs. Alving eulogizing her dead husband, I thought\nto myself what a damned pity it was the fellow was dead. Do you suppose\nthat he would have spoken if he had been alive? And do you suppose\nthat if any of the dead husbands came back they would be believed? Good\nnight, Doctor. You see that I am calm, and you can retire without fear.\n\nDOCTOR. Good night, then, Captain. I'm afraid. I can be of no further\nuse in this case.\n\nCAPTAIN. Are we enemies?\n\nDOCTOR. Far from it. But it is too bad we cannot be friends. Good night.\n\n[Goes. The Captain follows the Doctor to the door at back and then goes\nto the door at left and opens it slightly.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Come in, and we'll talk. I heard you out there listening.\n[Laura, embarrassed. Captain sits at desk.] It is late, but we must\ncome to some decision. Sit down. [Pause.] I have been at the post office\ntonight to get my letters. From these it appears that you have been\nkeeping back my mail, both coming and going. The consequence of which\nis that the loss of time has its good as destroyed the result I expected\nfrom my work.\n\nLAURA. It was an act of kindness on my part, as you neglected the\nservice for this other work.\n\nCAPTAIN. It was hardly kindness, for you were quite sure that some day\nI should win more honor from that, than from the service; but you were\nparticularly anxious that I should not win such honors, for fear your\nown insignificance would be emphasized by it. In consequence of all this\nI have intercepted letters addressed to you.\n\nLAURA. That was a noble act.\n\nCAPTAIN. You see, you have, as you might say, a high opinion of me.\nIt appears from these letters that, for some time past you have been\narraying my old friends against me by spreading reports about my mental\ncondition. And you Dave succeeded in your efforts, for now not more than\none person exists from the Colonel down to the cook, who believes that I\nam sane. Now these are the facts about my illness; my mind is sound, as\nyou know, so that I can take care of my duties in the service as well\nits my responsibilities as a father; my feelings are more or less under\nmy control, as my will has not been completely undermined; but you have\ngnawed and nibbled at it so that it will soon slip the cogs, and then\nthe whole mechanism will slip and go to smash. I will not appeal to your\nfeelings, for you have none; that is your strength; but I will appeal to\nyour interests.\n\nLAURA. Let me hear.\n\nCAPTAIN. You have succeeded in arousing my suspicions to such an extent\nthat my judgment is no longer clear, and my thoughts begin to wander.\nThis is the approaching insanity that you are waiting for, which may\ncome at any time now. So you are face to face with the question whether\nit is more to your interest that I should be sane or insane. Consider.\nIf I go under I shall lose the service, and where will you be then? If I\ndie, my life insurance will fall to you. But if I take my own life, you\nwill get nothing. Consequently, it is to your interest that I should\nlive out my life.\n\nLAURA. Is this a trap?\n\nCAPTAIN. To be sure. But it rests with you whether you will run around\nit or stick your head into it.\n\nLAURA. You say that you will kill yourself! You won't do that!\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you sure? Do you think a man can live when he has nothing\nand no one to live for?\n\nLAURA. You surrender, then?\n\nCAPTAIN. No, I offer peace.\n\nLAURA. The conditions?\n\nCAPTAIN. That I may keep my reason. Free me from my suspicions and I\ngive up the conflict.\n\nLAURA. What suspicions?\n\nCAPTAIN. About Bertha's origin.\n\nLAURA. Are there any doubts about that?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, I have doubts, and you have awakened them.\n\nLAURA. I?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, you have dropped them like henbane in my ears, and\ncircumstances have strengthened them. Free me from the uncertainty; tell\nme outright that it is true and I will forgive you beforehand.\n\nLAURA. How can I acknowledge a sin that I have not committed?\n\nCAPTAIN. What does it matter when you know that I shall not divulge it?\nDo you think a man would go and spread his own shame broadcast?\n\nLAURA. If I say it isn't true, you won't be convinced; but if I say it\nis, then you will be convinced. You seem to hope it is true!\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, strangely enough; it must be, because the first\nsupposition can't be proved; the latter can be.\n\nLAURA. Have you tiny ground for your suspicions?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, and no.\n\nLAURA. I believe you want to prove me guilty, so that you can get rid of\nme and then have absolute control over the child. But you won't catch me\nin any such snare.\n\nCAPTAIN. Do you think that I would want to be responsible for another\nman's child, if I were convinced of your guilt?\n\nLAURA. No, I'm sure you wouldn't, and that's what makes me know you lied\njust now when you said that you would forgive me beforehand.\n\nCAPTAIN. [Rises]. Laura, save me and my reason. You don't seem to\nunderstand what I say. If the child is not mine I have no control over\nher and don't want to have any, and that is precisely what you do want,\nisn't it? But perhaps you want even more--to have power over the child,\nbut still have me to support you.\n\nLAURA. Power, yes! What has this whole life and death struggle been for\nbut power?\n\nCAPTAIN. To me it has meant more. I do not believe in a hereafter; the\nchild was my future life. That was my conception of immortality, and\nperhaps the only one that has any analogy in reality. If you take that\naway from me, you cut off my life.\n\nLAURA. Why didn't we separate in time?\n\nCAPTAIN. Because the child bound us together; but the link became a\nchain. And how did it happen; how? I have never thought about this,\nbut now memories rise up accusingly, condemningly perhaps. We had been\nmarried two years, and had no children; you know why. I fell ill and lay\nat the point of death. During a conscious interval of the fever I heard\nvoices out in the drawing-room. It was you and the lawyer talking about\nthe fortune that I still possessed. He explained that you could inherit\nnothing because we had no children, and he asked you if you were\nexpecting to become a mother. I did not hear your reply. I recovered and\nwe had a child. Who is its father?\n\nLAURA. You.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, I am not. Here is a buried crime that begins to stench, and\nwhat a hellish crime! You women have been compassionate enough to free\nthe black slaves, but you have kept the white ones. I have worked\nand slaved for you, your child, your mother, your servants; I have\nsacrificed promotion and career; I have endured torture, flagellation,\nsleeplessness, worry for your sake, until my hair has grown gray; and\nall that you might enjoy a life without care, and when you grew old,\nenjoy life over again in your child. I have borne everything without\ncomplaint, because I thought myself the father of your child. This\nis the commonest kind of theft, the most brutal slavery. I have had\nseventeen years of penal servitude and have been innocent. What can you\ngive me in return for that?\n\nLAURA. Now you are quite mad.\n\nCAPTAIN. That is your hope!--And I see how you have labored to conceal\nyour crime. I sympathized with you because I did not understand your\ngrief. I have often lulled your evil conscience to rest when I thought I\nwas driving away morbid thoughts. I have heard you cry out in your sleep\nand not wanted to listen. I remember now night before last--Bertha's\nbirthday--it was between two and three in the morning, and I was sitting\nup reading; you shrieked, \"Don't, don't!\" as if someone were strangling\nyou; I knocked on the wall--I didn't want to hear any more. I have had\nmy suspicions for a long time but I did not dare to hear them confirmed.\nAll this I have suffered for you. What will you do for me?\n\nLAURA. What can I do? I will swear by God and all I hold sacred that you\nare Bertha's father.\n\nCAPTAIN. What use is that when you have often said that a mother can and\nought to commit any crime for her child? I implore you as a wounded man\nbegs for a death blow, to tell me all. Don't you see I'm as helpless as\na child? Don't you hear me complaining as to a mother? Won't you forget\nthat I am a man, that I am a soldier who can tame men and beasts with a\nword? Like a sick man I only ask for compassion. I lay down the tokens\nof my power and implore you to have mercy on my life.\n\n[Laura approaches him and lays her hand on his brow.]\n\nLAURA. What! You are crying, man!\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, I am crying although I am a man. But has not a man eyes!\nHas not a man hands, limbs, senses, thoughts, passions? Is he not fed\nwith the wine food, hurt by the same weapons, warmed and cooled by the\nsame summer and winter as a woman? If you prick us do we not bleed? If\nyou tickle us do we not laugh? And if you poison us, do we not die? Why\nshouldn't a man complain, a soldier weep? Because it is unmanly? Why is\nit unmanly?\n\nLAURA. Weep then, my child, as if you were with your mother once more.\nDo you remember when I first came into your life, I was like a second\nmother? Your great strong body needed nerves; you were a giant child\nthat had either come too early into the world, or perhaps was not wanted\nat all.\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, that's how it was. My father's and my mother's will was\nagainst my coming into the world, and consequently I was born without a\nwill. I thought I was completing myself when you and I became one, and\ntherefore you were allowed to rule, and I, the commander at the barracks\nand before the troops, became obedient to you, grew through you, looked\nup to you as to it more highly-gifted being, listened to you as if I had\nbeen your undeveloped child.\n\nLAURA. Yes, that's the way it was, and therefore I loved you as my\nchild. But you know, you must have seen, when the nature of your\nfeelings changed and you appeared as my lover that I blushed, and your\nembraces were joy that was followed by a remorseful conscience as if my\nblood were ashamed. The mother became the mistress. Ugh!\n\nCAPTAIN. I saw it, but I did not understand. I believed you despised me\nfor my unmanliness, and I wanted to win you as a woman by being a man.\n\nLAURA. Yes, but there was the mistake. The mother was your friend, you\nsee, but the woman was your enemy, and love between the sexes is strife.\nDo not think that I gave myself; I did not give, but I took--what I\nwanted. But you had one advantage. I felt that, and I wanted you to feel\nit.\n\nCAPTAIN. You always had the advantage. You could hypnotize me when I\nwas wide awake, so that I neither saw nor heard, but merely obeyed; you\ncould give me a raw potato and make me imagine it was a peach; you could\nforce me to admire your foolish caprices as though they were strokes of\ngenius. You could have influenced me to crime, yes, even to mean, paltry\ndeeds. Because you lacked intelligence, instead of carrying out my ideas\nyou acted on your own judgment. But when at last I awoke, I realized\nthat my honor had been corrupted and I wanted to blot out the memory by\na great deed, an achievement, a discovery, or an honorable suicide. I\nwanted to go to war, but was not permitted. It was then that I threw\nmyself into science. And now when I was about to reach out my hand to\ngather in its fruits, you chop off my arm. Now I am dishonored and can\nlive no longer, for a man cannot live without honor.\n\nLAURA. But a woman?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, for she has her children, which he has not. But, like the\nrest of mankind, we lived our lives unconscious as children, full of\nimagination, ideals, and illusions, and then we awoke; it was all\nover. But we awoke with our feet on the pillow, and he who waked us was\nhimself a sleep-walker. When women grow old and cease to be women, they\nget beards on their chins; I wonder what men get when they grow old and\ncease to be men. Those who crowed were no longer cocks but capons, and\nthe pullets answered their call, so that when we thought the sun was\nabout to rise we found ourselves in the bright moon light amid ruins,\njust as in the good old times. It had only been a little morning slumber\nwith wild dreams, and there was no awakening.\n\nLAURA. Do you know, you should have been a poet!\n\nCAPTAIN. Who knows.\n\nLAURA. Now I am sleepy, so if you have any more fantastic visions keep\nthem till to-morrow.\n\nCAPTAIN. First, a word more about realities. Do you hate me?\n\nLAURA. Yes, sometimes, when you are a man.\n\nCAPTAIN. This is like race hatred. If it is true that we are descended\nfrom monkeys, at least it must be from two separate species. We are\ncertainly not like one another, are we?\n\nLAURA. What do you mean to say by all this?\n\nCAPTAIN. I feel that one of us must go under in this struggle.\n\nLAURA. Which?\n\nCAPTAIN. The weaker, of course.\n\nLAURA. And the stronger will be in the right?\n\nCAPTAIN. Always, since he has the power.\n\nLAURA. Then I am in the right.\n\nCAPTAIN. Have you the power already then?\n\nLAURA. Yes, and a legal power with which I shall put you under the\ncontrol of a guardian.\n\nCAPTAIN. Under a guardian?\n\nLAURA. And then I shall educate my child without listening to your\nfantastic notions.\n\nCAPTAIN. And who will pay for the education when I am no longer here?\n\nLAURA. Your pension will pay for it.\n\nCAPTAIN [Threateningly]. How can you have me put under a guardian?\n\nLAURA [Takes out a letter]. With this letter of which an attested copy\nis in the hands of the board of lunacy.\n\nCAPTAIN. What letter?\n\nLAURA [Moving backward toward the door left]. Yours! Your declaration to\nthe doctor that you are insane. [The Captain stares at her in silence.]\nNow you have fulfilled your function as an unfortunately necessary\nfather and breadwinner, you are not needed any longer and you must go.\nYou must go, since you have realized that my intellect is as strong as\nmy will, and since you will not stay and acknowledge it.\n\n[The Captain goes to the table, seizes the lighted lamp and hurls it at\nLaura, who disappears backward through the door.]\n\nCURTAIN DROP.\n\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\n[Same Scene. Another lamp on the table. The private door is barricaded\nwith a chair.]\n\nLAURA [to Nurse]. Did he give you the keys?\n\nNURSE. Give them to me, no! God help me, but I took them from the\nmaster's clothes that N\u00c3\u00b6jd had out to brush.\n\nLAURA. Oh, N\u00c3\u00b6jd is on duty today?\n\nNURSE. Yes, N\u00c3\u00b6jd.\n\nLAURA. Give me the keys.\n\nNURSE. Yes, but this seems like downright stealing. Do you hear him\nwalking up there, Ma'am? Back and forth, back and forth.\n\nLAURA. Is the door well barred?\n\nNURSE. Oh, yes, it's barred well enough!\n\nLAURA. Control your feelings, Margret. We must be calm if we are to be\nsaved. [Knock.] Who is it?\n\nNURSE [Opens door to hall]. It is N\u00c3\u00b6jd.\n\nLAURA. Let him come in.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD [Comes in]. A message from the Colonel.\n\nLAURA. Give it to me [Reads] Ah!--N\u00c3\u00b6jd, have you taken all the\ncartridges out of the guns and pouches?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, Ma'am.\n\nLAURA. Good, wait outside while I answer the Colonel's letter. [N\u00c3\u00b6jd\ngoes. Laura writes.]\n\nNURSE. Listen. What in the world is he doing up there now?\n\nLAURA. Be quiet while I write.\n\n[The sound of sawing is heard.]\n\nNURSE [Half to herself]. Oh, God have mercy on us all! Where will this\nend!\n\nLAURA. Here, give this to N\u00c3\u00b6jd. And my mother must not know anything\nabout all this. Do you hear?\n\n[Nurse goes out, Laura opens drawers in desk and takes out papers. The\nPastor comes in, he takes a chair and sits near Laura by the desk.]\n\nPASTOR. Good evening, sister. I have been away all day, as you know, and\nonly just got back. Terrible things have been happening here.\n\nLAURA. Yes, brother, never have I gone through such a night and such a\nday.\n\nPASTOR. I see that you are none the worse for it all.\n\nLAURA. No, God be praised, but think what might have happened!\n\nPASTOR. Tell me one thing, how did it begin? I have heard so many\ndifferent versions.\n\nLAURA. It began with his wild idea of not being Bertha's father, and\nended with his throwing the lighted lamp in my face.\n\nPASTOR. But this is dreadful! It is fully developed insanity. And what\nis to be done now?\n\nLAURA. We must try to prevent further violence and the doctor has sent\nto the hospital for a straightjacket. In the meantime I have sent\na message to the Colonel, and I am now trying to straighten out\nthe affairs of the household, which he has carried on in a most\nreprehensible manner.\n\nPASTOR. This is a deplorable story, but I have always expected something\nof the sort. Fire and powder must end in an explosion. What have you got\nin the drawer there?\n\nLAURA [Has pulled out a drawer in the desk]. Look, he has hidden\neverything here.\n\nPASTOR [Looking into drawer]. Good Heavens, here is your doll and here\nis your christening cap and Bertha's rattle; and your letters; and the\nlocket. [Wipes his eyes.] After all he must have loved you very dearly,\nLaura. I never kept such things!\n\nLAURA. I believe he used to love me, but time--time changes so many\nthings.\n\nPASTOR. What is that big paper? The receipt for a grave! Yes, better the\ngrave than the lunatic asylum! Laura, tell me, are you blameless in all\nthis?\n\nLAURA. I? Why should I be to blame because a man goes out of his mind?\n\nPASTOR. Well, well, I shan't say anything. After all, blood is thicker\nthan water.\n\nLAURA. What do you dare to intimate?\n\nPASTOR [Looking at her penetratingly]. Now, listen!\n\nLAURA. Yes?\n\nPASTOR. You can hardly deny that it suits you pretty well to be able to\neducate your child as you wish?\n\nLAURA. I don't understand.\n\nPASTOR. How I admire you!\n\nLAURA. Me? H'm!\n\nPASTOR. And I am to become the guardian of that free-thinker! Do you\nknow I have always looked on him as a weed in our garden.\n\n[Laura gives a short laugh, and then becomes suddenly serious.]\n\nLAURA. And you dare say that to me--his wife?\n\nPASTOR. You are strong, Laura, incredibly strong. You are like a fox\nin a trap, you would rather gnaw off your own leg than let yourself\nbe caught! Like a master thief--no accomplice, not even your own\nconscience. Look at yourself in the glass! You dare not!\n\nLAURA. I never use a looking glass!\n\nPASTOR. No, you dare not! Let me look at your hand. Not a tell-tale\nblood stain, not a trace of insidious poison! A little innocent murder\nthat the law cannot reach, an unconscious crime--unconscious! What a\nsplendid idea! Do you hear how he is working up there? Take care! If\nthat man gets loose he will make short work of you.\n\nLAURA. You talk so much, you must have a bad conscience. Accuse me if\nyou can!\n\nPASTOR. I cannot.\n\nLAURA. You see! You cannot, and therefore I am innocent. You take care\nof your ward, and I will take care of mine! Here's the doctor.\n\n[Doctor comes in.]\n\nLAURA [Rising]. Good evening, Doctor. You at least will help me, won't\nyou? But unfortunately there is not much that can be done. Do you hear\nhow he is carrying on up there? Are you convinced now?\n\nDOCTOR. I am convinced that an act of violence has been committed, but\nthe question now is whether that act of violence can be considered an\noutbreak of passion or madness.\n\nPASTOR. But apart from the actual outbreak, you must acknowledge that he\nhas \"fixed ideas.\"\n\nDOCTOR. I think that your ideas, Pastor, are much more fixed.\n\nPASTOR. My settled views about the highest things are--\n\nDOCTOR. We'll leave settled views out of this. Madam, it rests with you\nto decide whether your husband is guilty to the extent of imprisonment\nand fine or should be put in an asylum! How do you class his behavior?\n\nLAURA. I cannot answer that now.\n\nDOCTOR. That is to say you have no decided opinion as to what will\nbe most advantageous to the interests of the family? What do you say,\nPastor?\n\nPASTOR. Well, there will be a scandal in either case. It is not easy to\nsay.\n\nLAURA. But if he is only sentenced to a fine for violence, he will be\nable to repeat the violence.\n\nDOCTOR. And if he is sent to prison he will soon be out again. Therefore\nwe consider it most advantageous for all parties that he should be\nimmediately treated as insane. Where is the nurse?\n\nLAURA. Why?\n\nDOCTOR. She must put the straightjacket on the patient when I have\ntalked to him and given the order! But not before. I have--the--garment\nout here. [Goes out into the hall rind returns with a large bundle.]\nPlease ask the nurse to come in here.\n\n[Laura rings.]\n\nPASTOR. Dreadful! Dreadful!\n\n[Nurse comes in.]\n\nDOCTOR [Takes out the straightjacket]. I want you to pay attention to\nthis. We want you to slip this jacket on the Captain, from behind, you\nunderstand, when I find it necessary to prevent another outbreak of\nviolence. You notice it has very long sleeves to prevent his moving and\nthey are to be tied at the back. Here are two straps that go through\nbuckles which are afterwards fastened to the arm of a chair or the sofa\nor whatever is convenient. Will you do it?\n\nNURSE. No, Doctor, I can't do that; I can't.\n\nLAURA. Why don't you do it yourself, Doctor?\n\nDOCTOR. Because the patient distrusts me. You, Madam, would seem to be\nthe one to do it, but I fear he distrusts even you.\n\n[Laura's face changes for an instant.]\n\nDOCTOR. Perhaps you, Pastor--\n\nPASTOR. No, I must ask to be excused.\n\n[N\u00c3\u00b6jd comes in.]\n\nLAURA. Have you delivered the message already?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, Madam.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, is it you, N\u00c3\u00b6jd? You know the circumstances here; you know\nthat the Captain is out of his mind and you must help us to take care of\nhim.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. If there is anything I can do for the Captain, you may be sure I\nwill do it.\n\nDOCTOR. You must put this jacket on him--\n\nNURSE. No, he shan't touch him. N\u00c3\u00b6jd might hurt him. I would rather do\nit myself, very, very gently. But N\u00c3\u00b6jd can wait outside and help me if\nnecessary. He can do that.\n\n[There is loud knocking on the private door.]\n\nDOCTOR. There he is! Put the jacket under your shawl on the chair, and\nyou must all go out for the time being and the Pastor and I will receive\nhim, for that door will not hold out many minutes. Now go.\n\nNURSE [Going out left.] The Lord help us!\n\n[Laura locks desk, then goes out left. N\u00c3\u00b6jd goes out back. After a\nmoment the private door is forced open, with such violence that the\nlock is broken and the chair is thrown into the middle of the room. The\nCaptain comes in with a pile of books under his arm, which he puts on\nthe table.]\n\nCAPTAIN. The whole thing is to be read here, in every book. So I wasn't\nout of my mind after all! Here it is in the Odyssey, book first, verse\n215, page 6 of the Upsala translation. It is Telemachus speaking to\nAthene. \"My mother indeed maintains that he, Odysseus, is my father,\nbut I myself know it not, for no man yet hath known his own origin.\"\nAnd this suspicion is harbored by Telemachus about Penelope, the most\nvirtuous of women! Beautiful, eh? And here we have the prophet Ezekiel:\n\"The fool saith; behold here is my father, but who can tell whose loins\nengendered him.\" That's quite clear! And what have we here? The History\nof Russian Literature by Mersl\u00c3\u00a4kow. Alexander Puschkin, Russia's\ngreatest poet, died of torture front the reports circulated about his\nwife's unfaithfulness rather than by the bullet in his breast, from a\nduel. On his death-bed he swore she was innocent. Ass, ass! How could he\nswear to it? You see, I read my books. Ah, Jonas, art you here? and the\ndoctor, naturally. Have you heard what I answered when an English lady\ncomplained about Irishmen who used to throw lighted lamps in their\nwives' faces? \"God, what women,\" I cried. \"Women,\" she gasped. \"Yes, of\ncourse,\" I answered. \"When things go so far that a man, a man who loved\nand worshipped a woman, takes a lighted lamp and throws it in her face,\nthen one may know.\"\n\nPASTOR. Know what?\n\nCAPTAIN. Nothing. One never knows anything. One only believes. Isn't\nthat true, Jonas? One believes and then one is saved! Yes, to be sure.\nNo, I know that one can be damned by his faith. I know that.\n\nDOCTOR. Captain!\n\nCAPTAIN. Silence! I don't want to talk to you; I won't listen to you\nrepeating their chatter in there, like a telephone! In there! You\nknow! Look here, Jonas; do you believe that you are the father of\nyour children? I remember that you had a tutor in your house who had a\nhandsome face, and the people gossiped about him.\n\nPASTOR. Adolf, take care!\n\nCAPTAIN. Grope under your toupee and feel if there are not two bumps\nthere. By my soul, I believe he turns pale! Yes, yes, they will talk;\nbut, good Lord, they talk so much. Still we are a lot of ridiculous\ndupes, we married men. Isn't that true, Doctor? How was it with your\nmarriage bed? Didn't you have a lieutenant in the house, eh? Wait a\nmoment and I will make a guess--his name was--[whispers in the Doctor's\near]. You see he turns pale, too! Don't be disturbed. She is dead and\nburied and what is done can't be undone. I knew him well, by the way,\nand he is now--look at me, Doctor--No, straight in my eyes--a major in\nthe cavalry! By God, if I don't believe he has horns, too.\n\nDOCTOR [Tortured]. Captain, won't you talk about something else?\n\nCAPTAIN. Do you see? He immediately wants to talk of something else when\nI mention horns.\n\nPASTOR. Do you know, Adolf, that you are insane?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes; I know that well enough. But if I only had the handling of\nyour illustrious brains for awhile I'd soon have you shut up, too! I am\nmad, but how did I become so? That doesn't concern you, and it doesn't\nconcern anyone. But you want to talk of something else now. [Takes the\nphotograph album from the table.] Good Lord, that is my child! Mine?\nWe can never know. Do you know what we would have to do to make sure?\nFirst, one should marry to get the respect of society, then be divorced\nsoon after and become lovers, and finally adopt the children. Then one\nwould at least be sure that they were one's adopted children. Isn't that\nright? But how can all that help us now? What can keep me now that you\nhave taken my conception of immortality from me, what use is science\nand philosophy to me when I have nothing to live for, what can I do with\nlife when I am dishonored? I grafted my right arm, half my brain, half\nmy marrow on another trunk, for I believed they would knit themselves\ntogether and grow into a more perfect tree, and then someone came with\na knife and cut below the graft, and now I am only half a tree. But the\nother half goes on growing with my arm and half my brain, while I wither\nand die, for they were the best parts I gave away. Now I want to die. Do\nwith me as you will. I am no more.\n\n[Buries his head on his arms on table. The Doctor whispers to the\nPastor, and they go out through the door left. Soon after Bertha comes\nin.]\n\nBERTRA [Goes up to Captain]. Are you ill, Father?\n\nCAPTAIN [Looks up dazed]. I?\n\nBERTHA. Do you know what you have done? Do you know that you threw the\nlamp at Mother?\n\nCAPTAIN. Did I?\n\nBERTHA. Yes, you did. Just think if she had been hurt.\n\nCAPTAIN. What would that have mattered?\n\nBERTHA. You are not my father when you talk like that.\n\nCAPTAIN. What do you say? Am I not your father? How do you know that?\nWho told you that? And who is your father, then? Who?\n\nBERTHA. Not you at any rate.\n\nCAPTAIN. Still not I? Who, then? Who? You seem to be well informed. Who\ntold you? That I should live to see my child come and tell me to my\nface that I am not her father! But don't you know that you disgrace your\nmother when you say that? Don't you know that it is to her shame if it\nis so?\n\nBERTHA. Don't say anything bad about Mother; do you hear?\n\nCAPTAIN. No; you hold together, every one of you, against me! and you\nhave always done so.\n\nBERTHA. Father!\n\nCAPTAIN. Don't use that word again!\n\nBERTHA. Father, father!\n\nCAPTAIN [Draws her to him]. Bertha, dear, dear child, you are my child!\nYes, Yes; it cannot be otherwise. It is so. The other was only sickly\nthoughts that come with the wind like pestilence and fever. Look at me\nthat I may see my soul in your eyes!--But I see her soul, too! You have\ntwo souls and you love me with one and hate me with the other. But you\nmust only love me! You must have only one soul, or you will never have\npeace, nor I either. You must have only one mind, which is the child of\nmy mind and one will, which is my will.\n\nBERTHA. But I don't want to, I want to be myself.\n\nCAPTAIN. You must not. You see, I am a cannibal, and I want to eat you.\nYour mother wanted to eat me, but she was not allowed to. I am Saturn\nwho ate his children because it had been prophesied that they would eat\nhim. To eat or be eaten! That is the question. If I do not eat you,\nyou will eat me, and you have already shown your teeth! But don't be\nfrightened my dear child; I won't harm you. [Goes and takes a revolver\nfrom the wall.]\n\nBERTHA [Trying to escape]. Help, Mother, help, he wants to kill me.\n\nNURSE [Comes in]. Mr. Adolf, what is it?\n\nCAPTAIN [Examining revolver]. Have you taken out the cartridges?\n\nNURSE. Yes, I put them away when I was tidying up, but sit down and be\nquiet and I'll get them out again!\n\n[She takes the Captain by the arm and gets him into a chair, into which\nhe sinks feebly. Then she takes out the straitjacket and goes behind the\nchair. Bertha slips out left.]\n\nNURSE. Mr. Adolf, do you remember when you were my dear little boy and\nI tucked you in at night and used to repeat: \"God who holds his children\ndear\" to you, and do you remember how I used to get up in the night and\ngive you a drink, how I would light the candle and tell you stories when\nyou had bad dreams and couldn't sleep? Do you remember all that?\n\nCAPTAIN. Go on talking, Margret, it soothes my head so. Tell me some\nmore.\n\nNURSE. O yes, but you must listen then! Do you remember when you took\nthe big kitchen knife and wanted to cut out boats with it, and how I\ncame in and had to get the knife away by fooling you? You were just a\nlittle child who didn't understand, so I had to fool you, for you didn't\nknow that it was for your own good. \"Give me that snake,\" I said, \"or\nit will bite you!\" and then you let go of the knife. [Takes the revolver\nout of the Captain's hand.] And then when you had to be dressed and\ndidn't want to, I had to coax you and say that you should have a coat\nof gold and be dressed like a prince. And then I took your little blouse\nthat was just made of green wool and held it in front of you and said:\n\"In with both arms,\" and then I said, \"Now sit nice and still while I\nbutton it down the back,\" [She puts the straightjacket on] and then I\nsaid, \"Get up now, and walk across the floor like a good boy so I can\nsee how it fits.\" [She leads him to the sofa.] And then I said, \"Now you\nmust go to bed.\"\n\nCAPTAIN. What did you say? Was I to go to bed when I was\ndressed--damnation! what have you done to me? [Tries to get free.] Ah!\nyou cunning devil of a woman! Who would have thought you had so much\nwit. [Lies down on sofa.] Trapped, shorn, outwitted, and not to be able\nto die!\n\nNURSE. Forgive me, Mr. Adolf, forgive me, but I wanted to keep you from\nkilling your child.\n\nCAPTAIN. Why didn't you let me? You say life is hell and death the\nkingdom of heaven, and children belong to heaven.\n\nNURSE. How do you know what comes after death?\n\nCAPTAIN. That is the only thing we do know, but of life we know nothing!\nOh, if one had only known from the beginning.\n\nNURSE. Mr. Adolf, humble your hard heart and cry to God for mercy; it is\nnot yet too late. It was not too late for the thief on the cross, when\nthe Saviour said, \"Today shalt thou be with me in Paradise.\"\n\nCAPTAIN. Are you croaking for a corpse already, you old crow?\n\n[Nurse takes a hymnbook out of her pocket.]\n\nCAPTAIN [Calls]. N\u00c3\u00b6jd, is N\u00c3\u00b6jd out there?\n\n[N\u00c3\u00b6jd comes in.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Throw this woman out! She wants to suffocate me with her\nhymn-book. Throw her out of the window, or up the chimney, or anywhere.\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. [Looks at Nurse]. Heaven help you, Captain, but I can't do that, I\ncan't. If it were only six men, but a woman!\n\nCAPTAIN. Can't you manage one woman, eh?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Of course I can,--but--well, you see, it's queer, but one never\nwants to lay hands on a woman.\n\nCAPTAIN. Why not? Haven't they laid hands on me?\n\nN\u00c3\u0096JD. Yes, but I can't, Captain. It's just as if you asked me to strike\nthe Pastor. It's second nature, like religion, I can't!\n\n[Laura comes in, she motions N\u00c3\u00b6jd to go.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Omphale, Omphale! Now you play with the club while Hercules\nspins your wool.\n\nLAURA [Goes to sofa]. Adolf, look at me. Do you believe that I am your\nenemy?\n\nCAPTAIN. Yes, I do. I believe that you are all my enemies! My mother was\nmy enemy when she did not want to bring me into the world because I\nwas to be born with pain, and she robbed my embryonic life of its\nnourishment, and made a weakling of me. My sister was my enemy when she\ntaught me that I must be submissive to her. The first woman I embraced\nwas my enemy, for she gave me ten years of illness in return for the\nlove I gave her. My daughter became my enemy when she had to choose\nbetween me and you. And you, my wife, you have been my arch enemy,\nbecause you never let up on me till I lay here lifeless.\n\nLAURA. I don't know that. I ever thought or even intended what you think\nI did. It may be that a dim desire to get rid of you as an obstacle lay\nat the bottom of it, and if you see any design in my behavior, it is\npossible that it existed, although I was unconscious of it. I have never\nthought how it all came about, but it is the result of the course you\nyourself laid out, and before God and my conscience I feel that I am\ninnocent, even if I am not. Your existence has lain like a stone on my\nheart--lain so heavily that I tried to shake off the oppressive burden.\nThis is the truth, and if I have unconsciously struck you down, I ask\nyour forgiveness.\n\nCAPTAIN. All that sounds plausible. But how does it help me? And whose\nfault is it? Perhaps spiritual marriages! Formerly one married a wife,\nnow, one enters into partnership with a business woman, or goes to\nlive with a friend--and then one ruins the partner, and dishonors the\nfriend!--What has become of love, healthy sensuous love? It died in the\ntransformation. And what is the result of this love in shares, payable\nto the bearer without joint liability? Who is the bearer when the crash\ncomes? Who is the fleshly father of the spiritual child?\n\nLAURA. And as for your suspicions about the child, they are absolutely\ngroundless.\n\nCAPTAIN. That's just what makes it so horrible. If at least there were\nany grounds for them, it would be something to get hold of, to cling to.\nNow there are only shadows that hide themselves in the bushes, and stick\nout their heads and grin; it is like fighting with the air, or firing\nblank cartridges in a sham fight. A fatal reality would have called\nforth resistance, stirred life and soul to action; but now my thoughts\ndissolve into air, and my brain grinds a void until it is on fire.--Put\na pillow under my head, and throw something over me, I am cold. I am\nterribly cold!\n\n[Laura takes her shawl and spreads it over him. Nurse goes to get a\npillow.]\n\nLAURA. Give me your hand, friend.\n\nCAPTAIN. My band! The hand that you have bound! Omphale! Omphale!--But\nI feel your shawl against my mouth; it is as warm and soft as your arm,\nand it smells of vanilla, like your hair when you were young! Laura,\nwhen you were young, and we walked in the birch woods, with the\nprimroses and the thrushes--glorious, glorious! Think how beautiful life\nwas, and what it is now. You didn't want to have it like this, nor did\nI, and yet it happened. Who then rules over life?\n\nLAURA. God alone rules--\n\nCAPTAIN. The God of strife then! Or the Goddess perhaps, nowadays.--Take\naway the cat that is lying on me! Take it away!\n\n[Nurse brings in a pillow and takes the shawl away.]\n\nCAPTAIN. Give me my army coat!--Throw it over me! [Nurse gets the coat\nand puts it over him.] Ah, my rough lion skin that, you wanted to take\naway from me! Omphale! Omphale! You cunning woman, champion of peace and\ncontriver of man's disarmament. Wake, Hercules, before they take your\nclub away from you! You would wile our armor from us too, and make\nbelieve that it is nothing but glittering finery. No, it was iron, let\nme tell you, before it ever glittered. In olden days the smith made the\narmor, now it is the needle woman. Omphale! Omphale! Rude strength\nhas fallen before treacherous weakness. Out on you infernal woman, and\ndamnation on your sex! [He raises himself to spit but falls back on the\nsofa.] What have you given me for a pillow, Margret? It is so hard, and\nso cold, so cold. Come and sit near me. There. May I put my head on your\nknee? So!--This is warm! Bend over me so that I can feel your breast!\nOh, it is sweet to sleep against a woman's breast, a mother's, or a\nmistress's, but the mother's is sweetest.\n\nLAURA. Would you like to see your child, Adolf?\n\nCAPTAIN. My child? A man has no children, it is only woman who has\nchildren, and therefore the future is hers when we die childless. Oh,\nGod, who holds his children dear!\n\nNURSE. Listen, he is praying to God.\n\nCAPTAIN. No, to you to put me to sleep, for I am tired, so tired. Good\nnight, Margret, and blessed be you among women.\n\n[He raises himself, but falls with a cry on the nurses's lap. Laura goes\nto left and calls the Doctor who comes in with the Pastor.]\n\nLAURA. Help us, Doctor, if it isn't too late. Look, he has stopped\nbreathing.\n\nDOCTOR [Feels the Captain's pulse.] It is a stroke.\n\nPASTOR. Is he dead?\n\nDOCTOR. No, he may yet cone back to life, but to what an awakening we\ncannot tell.\n\nPASTOR. \"First death, and then the judgment.\"\n\nDOCTOR. No judgment, and no accusations, you who believe that a God\nshapes man's destiny must go to him about this.\n\nNURSE. Ah, Pastor, with his last breath he prayed to God.\n\nPASTOR [To Laura]. Is that true?\n\nLAURA. It is.\n\nDOCTOR. In that case, which I can understand as little as the cause of\nhis illness, my skill is at an end. You try yours now, Pastor.\n\nLAURA. Is that all you have to say at this death-bed, Doctor?\n\nDOCTOR. That is all! I know no more. Let him speak who knows more.\n\n[Bertha comes in from left and runs to her mother.]\n\nBERTHA. Mother, Mother!\n\nLAURA. My child, my own child!\n\nPASTOR. Amen.\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS JULIE\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n     COUNTESS JULIE, twenty-five years old\n     JEAN, a valet, thirty\n     KRISTIN, a cook, thirty-five\n     FARM SERVANTS\n\nThe action takes place on Saint John's night, the mid-summer festival\nsurviving from pagan times.\n\n\n[SCENE.--A large kitchen. The ceiling and walls are partially covered\nby draperies and greens. The back wall slants upward from left side of\nscene. On back wall, left, are two shelves filled with copper kettles,\niron casseroles and tin pans. The shelves are trimmed with fancy\nscalloped paper. To right of middle a large arched entrance with glass\ndoors through which one sees a fountain with a statue of Cupid, syringa\nbushes in bloom and tall poplars. To left corner of scene a large stove\nwith hood decorated with birch branches. To right, servants' dining\ntable of white pine and a few chairs. On the end of table stands a\nJapanese jar filled with syringa blossoms. The floor is strewn with\njuniper branches.]\n\n[Near stove, an ice-box, sink and dish-table. A large old-fashioned\nbell, hangs over the door, to left of door a speaking tube.]\n\n[Kristin stands at stove engaged in cooking something. She wears a light\ncotton dress and kitchen apron. Jean comes in wearing livery; he carries\na large pair of riding-boots with spurs, which he puts on floor.]\n\nJEAN. Tonight Miss Julie is crazy again, perfectly crazy.\n\nKRISTIN. So--you're back at last.\n\nJEAN. I went to the station with the Count and coming back I went in to\nthe barn and danced and then I discovered Miss Julie there leading the\ndance with the gamekeeper. When she spied me, she rushed right toward me\nand asked me to waltz, and then she waltzed so--never in my life have I\nseen anything like it! Ah--she is crazy tonight.\n\nKRISTIN. She has always been. But never so much as in the last\nfortnight, since her engagement was broken off.\n\nJEAN. Yes, what about that gossip? He seemed like a fine fellow although\nhe wasn't rich! Ach! they have so much nonsense about them. [Seats\nhimself at table.] It's queer about Miss Julie though--to prefer staying\nhere at home among these people, eh, to going away with her father to\nvisit her relatives, eh?\n\nKRISTIN. She's probably shamefaced about breaking off with her intended.\n\nJEAN. No doubt! but he was a likely sort just the same. Do you know,\nKristin, how it happened? I saw it, although I didn't let on.\n\nKRISTIN. No--did you see it?\n\nJEAN. Yes, indeed, I did. They were out in the stable yard one evening\nand she was \"training\" him as she called it. Do you know what happened?\nShe made him leap over her riding whip, the way you teach a dog to\njump. He jumped it twice and got a lash each time; but the third time\nhe snatched the whip from her hand and broke it into pieces. And then he\nvanished!\n\nKRISTIN. Was that the way it happened? No, you don't say so!\n\nJEAN. Yes, that's the way the thing happened. But what have you got to\ngive me that's good, Kristin?\n\nKRISTIN. [She takes things from the pans on stove and serves them to\nhim.] Oh, it's only a bit of kidney that I cut out of the veal steak for\nyou.\n\nJEAN [Smelling the food]. Splendid! My favorite delicacy. [Feeling of\nplate]. But you might have warmed the plate.\n\nKRISTIN. You're fussier than the Count, when you get started. [Tweaks\nhis hair.]\n\nJEAN. Don't pull my hair! You know how sensitive I am.\n\nKRISTIN. Oh--there, there! you know I was only loving you.\n\n[Jean eats, and Kristin opens bottle of beer.]\n\nJEAN. Beer on midsummer night--thank you, no! I have something better\nthan that myself. [Takes bottle of wine from drawer of table.] Yellow\nseal, how's that? Now give me a glass--a wine glass you understand, of\ncourse, when one drinks the genuine.\n\nKRISTIN. [Fetches a glass. Then goes to stove and puts on casserole.]\nHeaven help the woman who gets you for her husband. Such a fuss budget!\n\nJEAN. Oh, talk! You ought to be glad to get such a fine fellow as I am.\nAnd I don't think it's done you any harm because I'm considered your\nintended. [Tastes wine.] Excellent, very excellent! Just a little too\ncold. [Warms glass with hands]. We bought this at Dijon. It stood at\nfour francs a litre in the bulk; then of course there was the duty\nbesides. What are you cooking now that smells so infernally?\n\nKRISTIN. Oh, it's some devil's mess that Miss Julie must have for Diana.\n\nJEAN. Take care of your words, Kristin. But why should you stand there\ncooking for that damned dog on a holiday evening? Is it sick, eh?\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, it's sick. Diana sneaked out with the gatekeeper's\nmongrels and now something is wrong. Miss Julie can't stand that.\n\nJEAN. Miss Julie has a great deal of pride about some things--but not\nenough about others! Just like her mother in her lifetime; she\nthrived best in the kitchen or the stable, but she must always drive\ntandem--never one horse! She would go about with soiled cuffs but she\nhad to have the Count's crest on her cuff buttons. And as for Miss\nJulie, she doesn't take much care of her appearance either. I should say\nshe isn't refined. Why just now out there she pulled the forester from\nAnna's side and asked him to dance with her. We wouldn't do things that\nway. But when the highborn wish to unbend they become vulgar. Splendid\nshe is though! Magnificent! Ah, such shoulders and--\n\nKRISTIN. Oh, don't exaggerate. I've heard what Clara says who dresses\nher sometimes, I have.\n\nJEAN. Ha! Clara--you women are always jealous of each other. I who've\nbeen out riding with her--!!! And such a dancer!\n\nKRISTIN. Come now, Jean, don't you want to dance with me when I'm\nthrough?\n\nJEAN. Of course I want to.\n\nKRISTIN. That is a promise?\n\nJEAN. Promise! When I say I will do a thing I do it! Thanks for the\nsupper--it was excellent.\n\n[Pushes cork in the bottle with a bang. Miss Julie appears in doorway,\nspeaking to someone outside.]\n\nJULIE. I'll be back soon, but don't let things wait for me.\n\n[Jean quickly puts bottle in table drawer and rises very respectfully.]\n\n[Enter Miss Julie and goes to Kristin.]\n\nJULIE. Is it done?\n\n[Kristin indicating Jean's presence.]\n\nJEAN [Gallantly]. Have you secrets between you?\n\nJULIE. [Flipping handkerchief in his face]. Curious, are you?\n\nJEAN. How sweet that violet perfume is!\n\nJULIE [Coquettishly]. Impudence! Do you appreciate perfumes too?\nDance--that you can do splendidly. [Jean looks towards the cooking\nstove]. Don't look. Away with you.\n\nJEAN [Inquisitive but polite]. Is it some troll's dish that you are both\nconcocting for midsummer night? Something to pierce the future with and\nevoke the face of your intended?\n\nJULIE [Sharply]. To see him one must have sharp eyes. [To Kristin].\nPut it into a bottle and cork it tight. Come now, Jean and dance a\nschottische with me.\n\n[Jean hesitates.]\n\nJEAN. I don't wish to be impolite to anyone but--this dance I promised\nto Kristin.\n\nJULIE. Oh, she can have another--isn't that so, Kristin? Won't you lend\nJean to me.\n\nKRISTIN. It's not for me to say, if Miss Julie is so gracious it's not\nfor me to say no. [To Jean]. Go you and be grateful for the honor.\n\nJEAN. Well said--but not wishing any offense I wonder if it is prudent\nfor Miss Julie to dance twice in succession with her servant, especially\nas people are never slow to find meaning in--\n\nJULIE [Breaking out]. In what? What sort of meaning? What were you going\nto say?\n\nJEAN [Taken aback]. Since Miss Julie does not understand I must speak\nplainly. It may look strange to prefer one of your--underlings--to\nothers who covet the same honor--\n\nJULIE. To prefer--what a thought! I, the lady of the house! I honor the\npeople with my presence and now that I feel like dancing I want to have\na partner who knows how to lead to avoid being ridiculous.\n\nJEAN. As Miss Julie commands. I'm here to serve.\n\nJULIE [Mildly]. You mustn't look upon that as a command. Tonight we are\nall in holiday spirits--full of gladness and rank is flung aside. So,\ngive me your arm! Don't be alarmed, Kristin, I shall not take your\nsweetheart away from you.\n\n[Jean offers arm. They exit.]\n\n[PANTOMIME.--Played as though the actress were really alone. Turns\nher back to the audience when necessary. Does not look out into the\nauditorium. Does not hurry as though fearing the audience might grow\nrestless. Soft violin music from the distance, schottische time. Kristin\nhums with the music. She cleans the table; washes plate, wipes it and\nputs it in the china closet. Takes off her apron and then opens drawer\nof table and takes a small hand glass and strands it against a flower\npot on table. Lights a candle and heats a hair pin with which she crimps\nher hair around her forehead. After that she goes to door at back and\nlistens. Then she returns to table and sees the Countess' handkerchief,\npicks it up, smells of it, then smooths it out and folds it. Enter\nJean.]\n\nJEAN. She is crazy I tell you! To dance like that! And the people stand\ngrinning at her behind the doors. What do you say to that, Kristin?\n\nKRISTIN. Oh, didn't I say she's been acting queer lately? But isn't it\nmy turn to dance now?\n\nJEAN. You are not angry because I let myself be led by the forelock?\n\nKRISTIN. No, not for such a little thing. That you know well enough. And\nI know my place too--\n\nJEAN [Puts arm around her waist]. You're a pretty smart girl, Kristin,\nand you ought to make a good wife.\n\n[Enter Miss Julie.]\n\nJULIE [Disagreeably surprised, but with forced gaiety]. You're a\ncharming cavalier to run away from your partner.\n\nJEAN. On the contrary, Miss Julie, I have hastened to my neglected one\nas you see.\n\nJULIE [Changing subject]. Do you know, you dance wonderfully well! But\nwhy are you in livery on a holiday night? Take it off immediately.\n\nJEAN. Will you excuse me--my coat hangs there. [Goes R. and takes coat.]\n\nJULIE. Does it embarrass you to change your coat in my presence? Go to\nyour room then--or else stay and I'll turn my back.\n\nJEAN. With your permission, Miss Julie.\n\n[Exit Jean R. One sees his arm as he changes coat.]\n\nJULIE [To Kristin]. Is Jean your sweetheart, that he is so devoted?\n\nKRISTIN. Sweetheart? Yes, may it please you. Sweetheart--that's what\nthey call it.\n\nJULIE. Call it?\n\nKRISTIN. Oh Miss Julie has herself had a sweetheart and--\n\nJULIE. Yes, we were engaged--\n\nKRISTIN. But it came to nothing.\n\n[Enter Jean in black frock coat.]\n\nJULIE. Tres gentil, Monsieur Jean, tres gentil.\n\nJEAN. Vous voulez plaisanter, Mademoiselle.\n\nJULIE. Et vous voulez parler francais? Where did you learn that?\n\nJEAN. In Switzerland where I was butler in the largest hotel at Lucerne.\n\nJULIE. Why, you look like a gentleman in your frock coat. Charmant!\n[Seats herself by table.]\n\nJEAN. You flatter me!\n\nJULIE. Flatter! [Picking him up on the word.]\n\nJEAN. My natural modesty forbids me to believe that you could mean\nthese pleasant things that you say to a--such as I am--and therefore I\nallowed myself to fancy that you overrate or, as it is called, flatter.\n\nJULIE. Where did you learn to use words like that? Have you frequented\nthe theatres much?\n\nJEAN. I have frequented many places, I have!\n\nJULIE. But you were born here in this neighborhood?\n\nJEAN. My father was a deputy under the public prosecutor, and I saw Miss\nJulie as a child--although she didn't see me!\n\nJULIE. No, really?\n\nJEAN. Yes, I remember one time in particular. But I mustn't talk about\nthat.\n\nJULIE. Oh yes, do, when was it?\n\nJEAN. No really--not now, another time perhaps.\n\nJULIE. \"Another time\" is a good for nothing. Is it so dreadful then?\n\nJEAN. Not dreadful--but it goes against the grain. [Turns and points to\nKristin, who has fallen asleep in a chair near stove]. Look at her.\n\nJULIE. She'll make a charming wife! Does she snore too?\n\nJEAN. No, but she talks in her sleep.\n\nJULIE [Cynically]. How do you know that she talks in her sleep?\n\nJEAN [Boldly]. I have heard her.[Pause and they look at each other.]\n\nJULIE. Why don't you sit down?\n\nJEAN. I can't allow myself to do so in your presence.\n\nJULIE. But if I command you?\n\nJEAN. Then I obey.\n\nJULIE. Sit down then. But wait--can't you get me something to drink\nfirst?\n\nJEAN. I don't know what there is in the icebox. Nothing but beer,\nprobably.\n\nJULIE. Is beer nothing? My taste is so simple that I prefer it to wine.\n\n[Jean takes out beer and serves it on plate.]\n\nJEAN. Allow me.\n\nJULIE. Won't you drink too?\n\nJEAN. I am no friend to beer--but if Miss Julie commands.\n\nJULIE [Gaily]. Commands! I should think as a polite cavalier you might\njoin your lady.\n\nJEAN. Looking at it in that way you are quite right. [Opens another\nbottle of beer and fills glass.]\n\nJULIE. Give me a toast!\n\n[Jean hesitates.]\n\nJULIE [Mockingly]. Old as he is, I believe the man is bashful!\n\nJEAN [On his knee with mock gallantry, raises glass]. A health to my\nlady of the house!\n\nJULIE. Bravo! Now you must kiss my slipper. Then the thing is perfect.\n\n[Jean hesitates and then seizes her foot and kisses it lightly.]\n\nJULIE. Splendid! You should have been an actor.\n\nJEAN [Rising]. But this mustn't go any further, Miss Julie. What if\nsomeone should come in and see us?\n\nJULIE. What harm would that do?\n\nJEAN. Simply that it would give them a chance to gossip. And if Miss\nJulie only knew how their tongues wagged just now--then--\n\nJULIE. What did they say? Tell me. And sit down now.\n\nJEAN [Sitting]. I don't wish to hurt you, but they used an\nexpression--threw hints of a certain kind--but you are not a child,\nyou can understand. When one sees a lady drinking alone with a man--let\nalone a servant--at night--then--\n\nJULIE. Then what? And for that matter, we are not alone. Kristin is\nhere.\n\nJEAN. Sleeping! Yes.\n\nJULIE. Then I shall wake her. [Rises]. Kristin, are you asleep?\n\nKRISTIN. [In her sleep]. Bla--bla--bla--bla.\n\nJULIE. Kristin! She certainly can sleep. [Goes to Kristin.]\n\nKRISTIN. [In her sleep]. The Count's boots are polished--put on the\ncoffee--soon--soon--soon. Oh--h-h-h--puh! [Breathes heavily. Julie takes\nher by the nose.]\n\nJULIE. Won't you wake up?\n\nJEAN [Sternly]. Don't disturb the sleeping.\n\nJULIE [Sharply]. What?\n\nJEAN. Anyone who has stood over the hot stove all day long is tired when\nnight comes. One should respect the weary.\n\nJULIE. That's a kind thought--and I honor it. [Offers her hand.] Thanks\nfor the suggestion. Come out with me now and pick some syringas.\n\n[Kristin has awakened and goes to her room, right, in a sort of sleep\nstupified way.]\n\nJEAN. With Miss Julie?\n\nJULIE. With me.\n\nJEAN. But that wouldn't do--decidedly not.\n\nJULIE. I don't understand you. Is it possible that you fancy that I--\n\nJEAN. No--not I, but people.\n\nJULIE. What? That I'm in love with my coachman?\n\nJEAN. I am not presumptuous, but we have seen instances--and with the\npeople nothing is sacred.\n\nJULIE. I believe he is an aristocrat!\n\nJEAN. Yes, I am.\n\nJULIE. But I step down-- --\n\nJEAN. Don't step down, Miss Julie. Listen to me--no one would believe\nthat you stepped down of your own accord; people always say that one\nfalls down.\n\nJULIE. I think better of the people than you do. Come--and try\nthem--come!\n\n[Dares him with a look.]\n\nJEAN. Do you know that you are wonderful?\n\nJULIE. Perhaps. But you are too. Everything is wonderful for that\nmatter. Life, people--everything. Everything is wreckage, that drifts\nover the water until it sinks, sinks. I have the same dream every now\nand then and at this moment I am reminded of it. I find myself seated at\nthe top of a high pillar and I see no possible way to get down. I grow\ndizzy when I look down, but down I must. But I'm not brave enough to\nthrow myself; I cannot hold fast and I long to fall--but I don't fall.\nAnd yet I can find no rest or peace until I shall come down to earth;\nand if I came down to earth I would wish myself down in the ground. Have\nyou ever felt like that?\n\nJEAN. No, I dream that I'm lying in a dark wood under a tall tree and I\nwould up--up to the top, where I can look far over the fair landscape,\nwhere the sun is shining. I climb--climb, to plunder the birds' nests\nup there where the golden eggs lie, but the tree trunk is so thick, so\nsmooth, and the first limb is so high! But I know if I reached the first\nlimb I should climb as though on a ladder, to the top. I haven't reached\nit yet, but I shall reach it, if only in the dream.\n\nJULIE. Here I stand talking about dreams with you. Come now, just out in\nthe park.\n\n[She offers her arm and they start.]\n\nJEAN. We should sleep on nine midsummer flowers tonight and then our\ndreams would come true.\n\n[She turns, Jean quickly holds a hand over his eye.]\n\nJULIE. What is it, something in your eye?\n\nJEAN. Oh, it is nothing--just a speck. It will be all right in a moment.\n\nJULIE. It was some dust from my sleeve that brushed against you. Now\nsit down and let me look for it. [Pulls him into a chair, looks into his\neye.] Now sit still, perfectly still. [Uses corner of her handkerchief\nin his eye. Strikes his hand.] So--will you mind? I believe you are\ntrembling, strong man that you are. [Touching his arm.] And such arms!\n\nJEAN [Warningly.] Miss Julie!\n\nJULIE. Yes, Monsieur Jean!\n\nJEAN. Attention. Je ne suis qu'un homme!\n\nJULIE. Will you sit still! So, now it is gone! Kiss my hand and thank\nme!\n\n[Jean rises.]\n\nJEAN. Miss Julie, listen to me. Kristin has gone to bed now--will you\nlisten to me--\n\nJULIE. Kiss my hand first.\n\nJEAN. Listen to me--\n\nJULIE. Kiss my hand first.\n\nJEAN. Yes, but blame yourself.\n\nJULIE. For what?\n\nJEAN. For what? Are you a child at twenty-five? Don't you know that it\nis dangerous to play with fire?\n\nJULIE. Not for me. I am insured!\n\nJEAN. No, you are not. But even if you are, there is inflammable\nmaterial in the neighborhood.\n\nJULIE. Might that be you?\n\nJEAN. Yes, not because it is I, but because I'm a young man--\n\nJULIE [Scornfully]. With a grand opportunity--what inconceivable\npresumption! A Don Juan perhaps! Or a Joseph! On my soul, I believe he\nis a Joseph!\n\nJEAN. You do?\n\nJULIE. Almost.\n\n[Jean rushes towards her and tries to take her in his arms to kiss her.]\n\nJULIE [Gives him a box on the ear]. Shame on you.\n\nJEAN. Are you in earnest, or fooling?\n\nJULIE. In earnest.\n\nJEAN. Then you were in earnest a moment ago, too. You play too seriously\nwith what is dangerous. Now I'm tired of playing and beg to be excused\nthat I may go on with my work. The Count must have his boots in time,\nand it is long past midnight. [Jean picks up boots.]\n\nJULIE. Put those boots away.\n\nJEAN. No, that is my work which it is my duty to do, but I was not hired\nto be your play thing and that I shall never be. I think too well of\nmyself for that.\n\nJULIE. You are proud.\n\nJEAN. In some things--not in others.\n\nJULIE. Were you ever in love?\n\nJEAN. We do not use that word, but I have liked many girls. One time I\nwas sick because I couldn't have the one I wanted--sick, you understand,\nlike the princesses in the Arabian Nights who could not eat nor drink\nfor love sickness.\n\nJULIE. Who was she? [Jean is silent.] Who was she?\n\nJEAN. That you could not make me tell.\n\nJULIE. Not if I ask you as an equal, as a--friend? Who was she?\n\nJEAN. It was you!\n\n[Julie seats herself.]\n\nJULIE. How extravagant!\n\nJEAN. Yes, if you will, it was ridiculous. That was the story I\nhesitated to tell, but now I'm going to tell it. Do you know how people\nin high life look from the under world? No, of course you don't. They\nlook like hawks and eagles whose backs one seldom sees, for they soar up\nabove. I lived in a hovel provided by the state, with seven brothers and\nsisters and a pig; out on a barren stretch where nothing grew, not even\na tree, but from the window I could see the Count's park walls with\napple trees rising above them. That was the garden of paradise; and\nthere stood many angry angels with flaming swords protecting it; but\nfor all that I and other boys found the way to the tree of life--now you\ndespise me.\n\nJULIE. Oh, all boys steal apples.\n\nJEAN. You say that, but you despise me all the same. No matter! One time\nI entered the garden of paradise--it was to weed the onion beds with my\nmother! Near the orchard stood a Turkish pavilion, shaded and overgrown\nwith jessamine and honeysuckle. I didn't know what it was used for and\nI had never seen anything so beautiful. People passed in and out and one\nday--the door was left open. I sneaked in and beheld walls covered with\npictures of kings and emperors and there were red-fringed curtains at\nthe windows--now you understand what I mean--I--[Breaks off a spray of\nsyringes and puts it to her nostrils.] I had never been in the castle\nand how my thoughts leaped--and there they returned ever after. Little\nby little the longing came over me to experience for once the pleasure\nof--enfin, I sneaked in and was bewildered. But then I heard someone\ncoming--there was only one exit for the great folk, but for me there was\nanother, and I had to choose that. [Julie who has taken the syringa\nlets it fall on table.] Once out I started to run, scrambled through a\nraspberry hedge, rushed over a strawberry bed and came to a stop on\nthe rose terrace. For there I saw a figure in a white dress and white\nslippers and stockings--it was you! I hid under a heap of weeds, under,\nyou understand, where the thistles pricked me, and lay on the damp, rank\nearth. I gazed at you walking among the roses. And I thought if it is\ntrue that the thief on the cross could enter heaven and dwell among the\nangels it was strange that a pauper child on God's earth could not go\ninto the castle park and play with the Countess' daughter.\n\nJULIE [Pensively]. Do you believe that all poor children would have such\nthoughts under those conditions?\n\nJEAN [Hesitates, then in a positive voice]. That all poor children--yes,\nof course, of course!\n\nJULIE. It must be a terrible misfortune to be poor.\n\nJEAN [With deep pain and great chagrin]. Oh, Miss Julie, a dog may lie\non the couch of a Countess, a horse may be caressed by a lady's hand,\nbut a servant--yes, yes, sometimes there is stuff enough in a man,\nwhatever he be, to swing himself up in the world, but how often does\nthat happen! But to return to the story, do you know what I did? I ran\ndown to the mill dam and threw myself in with my clothes on--and was\npulled out and got a thrashing. But the following Sunday when all the\nfamily went to visit my grandmother I contrived to stay at home; I\nscrubbed myself well, put on my best clothes, such as they were, and\nwent to church so that I might see you. I saw you. Then I went home\nwith my mind made up to put an end to myself. But I wanted to do\nit beautifully and without pain. Then I happened to remember that\nelderberry blossoms are poisonous. I knew where there was a big\nelderberry bush in full bloom and I stripped it of its riches and made\na bed of it in the oat-bin. Have you ever noticed how smooth and glossy\noats are? As soft as a woman's arm.--Well, I got in and let down the\ncover, fell asleep, and when I awoke I was very ill, but didn't die--as\nyou see. What I wanted--I don't know. You were unattainable, but through\nthe vision of you I was made to realize how hopeless it was to rise\nabove the conditions of my birth.\n\nJULIE. You tell it well! Were you ever at school?\n\nJEAN. A little, but I have read a good deal and gone to the theatres.\nAnd besides, I have always heard the talk of fine folks and from them I\nhave learned most.\n\nJULIE. Do you listen then to what we are saying?\n\nJEAN. Yes, indeed, I do. And I have heard much when I've been on the\ncoachbox. One time I heard Miss Julie and a lady--\n\nJULIE. Oh, what was it you heard?\n\nJEAN. Hm! that's not so easy to tell. But I was astonished and could\nnot understand where you had heard such things. Well, perhaps at bottom\nthere's not so much difference between people and--people.\n\nJULIE. Oh, shame! We don't behave as you do when we are engaged.\n\nJEAN. [Eyeing her]. Are you sure of that? It isn't worthwhile to play\nthe innocent with me.\n\nJULIE. I gave my love to a rascal.\n\nJEAN. That's what they always say afterward.\n\nJULIE. Always?\n\nJEAN. Always, I believe, as I have heard the expression many times\nbefore under the same circumstances.\n\nJULIE. What circumstances?\n\nJEAN. Those we've been talking about. The last time I-- --\n\nJULIE. Silence. I don't wish to hear any more.\n\nJEAN. Well, then I beg to be excused so I may go to bed.\n\nJULIE. Go to bed! On midsummer night?\n\nJEAN. Yes, for dancing out there with that pack has not amused me.\n\nJULIE. Then get the key for the boat and row me out over the lake. I\nwant to see the sun rise.\n\nJEAN. Is that prudent?\n\nJULIE. One would think that you were afraid of your reputation.\n\nJEAN. Why not? I don't want to be made ridiculous. I am not willing to\nbe driven out without references, now that I am going to settle down.\nAnd I feel I owe something to Kristin.\n\nJULIE. Oh, so it's Kristin now--\n\nJEAN. Yes, but you too. Take my advice, go up and go to bed.\n\nJULIE. Shall I obey you?\n\nJEAN. For once--for your own sake. I beg of you. Night is crawling\nalong, sleepiness makes one irresponsible and the brain grows hot. Go to\nyour room. In fact--if I hear rightly some of the people are coming for\nme. If they find us here--then you are lost.\n\n[Chorus is heard approaching, singing.]\n\n      \"There came two ladies out of the woods\n       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra.\n       One of them had wet her foot,\n       Tridiridi-ralla-la.\n\n      \"They talked of a hundred dollars,\n       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra.\n       But neither had hardly a dollar,\n       Tridiridi-ralla-la.\n\n      \"The mitten I'm going to send you,\n       Tridirichi-ralla tridiridi-ra.\n       For another I'm going to jilt you,\n       Tridiridi-ralla tridiridi-ra.\"\n\nJULIE. I know the people and I love them and they respect me. Let them\ncome, you shall see.\n\nJEAN. No, Miss Julie, they don't love you. They take your food and spit\nupon your kindness, believe me. Listen to them, listen to what they're\nsinging! No! Don't listen!\n\nJULIE [Listening]. What are they singing?\n\nJEAN. It's something suggestive, about you and me.\n\nJULIE. Infamous! Oh horrible! And how cowardly!\n\nJEAN. The pack is always cowardly. And in such a battle one can only run\naway.\n\nJULIE. Run away? Where? We can't get out and we can't go to Kristin.\n\nJEAN. Into my room then. Necessity knows no law. You can depend on me\nfor I am your real, genuine, respectful friend.\n\nJULIE. But think if they found you there.\n\nJEAN. I will turn the key and if they try to break in I'll shoot.\nCome--come!\n\nJULIE. [Meaningly]. You promise me--?\n\nJEAN. I swear...\n\n[She exits R. Jean follows her.]\n\n[BALLET.--The farm folk enter in holiday dress with flowers in their\nhats, a fiddler in the lead. They carry a keg of home-brewed beer and a\nsmaller keg of gin, both decorated with greens which are placed on the\ntable. They help themselves to glasses and drink. Then they sing and\ndance a country dance to the melody of \"There came two ladies out of the\nwoods.\" When that is over they go out, singing.]\n\n[Enter Julie alone, sees the havoc the visitors have made, clasps her\nhands, takes out powder box and powders her face. Enter Jean exuberant.]\n\nJEAN. There, you see, and you heard them. Do you think it's possible for\nus to remain here any longer?\n\nJULIE. No, I don't. But what's to be done?\n\nJEAN. Fly! Travel--far from here!\n\nJULIE. Travel--yes--but where?\n\nJEAN. To Switzerland--to the Italian lakes. You have never been there?\n\nJULIE. No--is it beautiful there?\n\nJEAN. Oh, an eternal summer! Oranges, trees, laurels--oh!\n\nJULIE. But what shall we do there?\n\nJEAN. I'll open a first-class hotel for first-class patrons.\n\nJULIE. Hotel?\n\nJEAN. That is life--you shall see! New faces constantly, different\nlanguages. Not a moment for boredom. Always something to do night and\nday--the bell ringing, the trains whistling, the omnibus coming and\ngoing and all the time the gold pieces rolling into the till--that is\nlife!\n\nJULIE. Yes, that is life. And I--?\n\nJEAN. The mistress of the establishment--the ornament of the house. With\nyour looks--and your manners--oh, it's a sure success! Colossal! You\ncould sit like a queen in the office and set the slaves in action by\ntouching an electric button. The guests line up before your throne\nand shyly lay their riches on your desk. You can't believe how people\ntremble when they get their bills--I can salt the bills and you can\nsweeten them with your most bewitching smile--ha, let us get away from\nhere--[Takes a time table from his pocket] immediately--by the next\ntrain. We can be at Malm\u00c3\u00b6 at 6.30, Hamburg at 8.40 tomorrow morning,\nFrankfort the day after and at Como by the St. Gothard route in\nabout--let me see, three days. Three days!\n\nJULIE. All that is well enough, but Jean--you must give me courage. Take\nme in your arms and tell me that you love me.\n\nJEAN [Hesitatingly]. I will--but I daren't--not again in this house. I\nlove you of course--do you doubt that?\n\nJULIE [Shyly and with womanliness]. You! Say thou to me! Between us\nthere can be no more formality. Say thou.\n\nJEAN. I can't--There must be formality between us--as long as we are\nin this house. There is the memory of the past--and there is the\nCount, your father. I have never known anyone else for whom I have such\nrespect. I need only to see his gloves lying in a chair to feel my own\ninsignificance. I have only to hear his bell to start like a nervous\nhorse--and now as I see his boots standing there so stiff and proper I\nfeel like bowing and scraping. [Gives boots a kick]. Superstitions and\nprejudices taught in childhood can't be uprooted in a moment. Let us go\nto a country that is a republic where they'll stand on their heads for\nmy coachman's livery--on their heads shall they stand--but I shall not.\nI am not born to bow and scrape, for there's stuff in me--character.\nIf I only get hold of the first limb, you shall see me climb. I'm a\ncoachman today, but next year I shall be a proprietor, in two years a\ngentleman of income; then for Roumania where I'll let them decorate me\nand can, mark you, _can_ end a count!\n\nJULIE. Beautiful, beautiful!\n\nJEAN. Oh, in Roumania, one can buy a title cheap--and so you can be a\ncountess just the same--my countess!\n\nJULIE. What do I care for all that--which I now cast behind me. Say that\nyou love me--else, what am I, without it?\n\nJEAN. I'll say it a thousand times afterwards, but not here. Above all,\nlet us have no sentimentality now or everything will fall through. We\nmust look at this matter coldly like sensible people. [Takes out a cigar\nand lights it.] Now sit down there and I'll sit here and we'll talk it\nover as if nothing had happened.\n\nJULIE [Staggered]. Oh, my God, have you no feeling?\n\nJEAN. I? No one living has more feeling than I but I can restrain\nmyself.\n\nJULIE. A moment ago you could kiss my slipper and now--\n\nJEAN [Harshly]. That was--then. Now we have other things to think about.\n\nJULIE. Don't speak harshly to me.\n\nJEAN. Not harshly, but wisely. One folly has been committed--commit no\nmore. The Count may be here at any moment, and before he comes, our\nfate must be settled. How do my plans for the future strike you? Do you\napprove of them?\n\nJULIE. They seem acceptable enough. But one question. For such a great\nundertaking a large capital is necessary, have you that?\n\nJEAN [Chewing his cigar]. I? To be sure. I have my regular occupation,\nmy unusual experience, my knowledge of different languages--that is\ncapital that counts, I should say.\n\nJULIE. But with all that you could not buy a railway ticket.\n\nJEAN. That's true, and for that reason I'm looking for a backer who can\nfurnish the funds.\n\nJULIE. How can that be done at a moment's notice?\n\nJEAN. That is for you to say, if you wish to be my companion.\n\nJULIE. I can't--as I have nothing myself.\n\n[A pause.]\n\nJEAN. Then the whole matter drops-- --\n\nJULIE. And-- --\n\nJEAN. Things remain as they are.\n\nJULIE. Do you think I could remain under this roof after----Do you think\nI will allow the people to point at me in scorn, or that I can ever look\nmy father in the face again? Never! Take me away from this humiliation\nand dishonor. Oh, what have I done! Oh, my God, what have I done!\n[Weeping.]\n\nJEAN. So, you are beginning in that tune now. What have you done? The\nsame as many before you.\n\nJULIE. And now you despise me. I am falling! I am falling!\n\nJEAN. Fall down to my level, I'll lift you up afterwards.\n\nJULIE. What strange power drew me to you--the weak to the strong--the\nfalling to the rising, or is this love! This--love! Do you know what\nlove is?\n\nJEAN. I? Yes! Do you think it's the first time?\n\nJULIE. What language, what thoughts.\n\nJEAN. I am what life has made me. Don't be nervous and play the high and\nmighty, for now we are on the same level. Look here, my little girl, let\nme offer you a glass of something extra fine. [Opens drawer of table\nand takes out wine bottle, then fills two glasses that have been already\nused.]\n\nJULIE. Where did you get that wine?\n\nJEAN. From the cellar.\n\nJULIE. My father's Burgundy.\n\nJEAN. What's the matter, isn't that good enough for the son-in-law?\n\nJULIE. And I drink beer--I!\n\nJEAN. That only goes to prove that your taste is poorer than mine.\n\nJULIE. Thief!\n\nJEAN. Do you intend to tattle?\n\nJULIE. Oh ho! Accomplice to a house thief. Was I intoxicated--have I\nbeen walking in my sleep this night--midsummer night, the night for\ninnocent play--\n\nJEAN. Innocent, eh!\n\nJULIE [Pacing back and forth]. Is there a being on earth so miserable as\nI.\n\nJEAN. Why are you, after such a conquest. Think of Kristin in there,\ndon't you think she has feelings too?\n\nJULIE. I thought so a little while ago, but I don't any more. A servant\nis a servant.\n\nJEAN. And a whore is a whore.\n\nJULIE [Falls on her knees with clasped hands]. Oh, God in heaven, end\nmy wretched life, save me from this mire into which I'm sinking--Oh save\nme, save me.\n\nJEAN. I can't deny that it hurts me to see you like this.\n\nJULIE. And you who wanted to die for me.\n\nJEAN. In the oat-bin? Oh, that was only talk.\n\nJULIE. That is to say--a lie!\n\nJEAN [Beginning to show sleepiness]. Er--er almost. I believe I read\nsomething of the sort in a newspaper about a chimney-sweep who made\na death bed for himself of syringa blossoms in a wood-bin--[laughs]\nbecause they were going to arrest him for non-support of his children.\n\nJULIE. So you are such a--\n\nJEAN. What better could I have hit on! One must always be romantic to\ncapture a woman.\n\nJULIE. Wretch! Now you have seen the eagle's back, and I suppose I am to\nbe the first limb--\n\nJEAN. And the limb is rotten--\n\nJULIE [Without seeming to hear]. And I am to be the hotel's signboard--\n\nJEAN. And I the hotel--\n\nJULIE. And sit behind the desk and allure guests and overcharge them--\n\nJEAN. Oh, that'll be my business.\n\nJULIE. That a soul can be so degraded!\n\nJEAN. Look to your own soul.\n\nJULIE. Lackey! Servant! Stand up when I speak.\n\nJEAN. Don't you dare to moralize to me. Lackey, eh! Do you think you\nhave shown yourself finer than any maid-servant tonight?\n\nJULIE [Crushed]. That is right, strike me, trample on me, I deserve\nnothing better. I have done wrong, but help me now. Help me out of this\nif there is any possible way.\n\nJEAN [Softens somewhat]. I don't care to shirk my share of the blame,\nbut do you think any one of my position would ever have dared to raise\nhis eyes to you if you yourself had not invited it? Even now I am\nastonished--\n\nJULIE. And proud.\n\nJEAN. Why not? Although I must confess that the conquest was too easy to\nbe exciting.\n\nJULIE. Go on, strike me again--\n\nJEAN [Rising]. No, forgive me, rather, for what I said. I do not strike\nthe unarmed, least of all, a woman. But I can't deny that from a certain\npoint of view it gives me satisfaction to know that it is the glitter of\nbrass, not gold, that dazzles us from below, and that the eagle's back\nis grey like the rest of him. On the other hand, I'm sorry to have to\nrealize that all that I have looked up to is not worth while, and it\npains me to see you fallen lower than your cook as it pains me to see\nautumn blossoms whipped to pieces by the cold rain and transformed\ninto--dirt!\n\nJULIE. You speak as though you were already my superior.\n\nJEAN. And so I am! For I can make you a countess and you could never\nmake me a count.\n\nJULIE. But I am born of a count, that you can never be.\n\nJEAN. That is true, but I can be the father of counts--if--\n\nJULIE. But you are a thief--that I am not.\n\nJEAN. There are worse things than that, and for that matter when I serve\nin a house I regard myself as a member of the family, a child of the\nhouse as it were. And one doesn't consider it theft if children snoop\na berry from full bushes. [With renewed passion]. Miss Julie, you are a\nglorious woman--too good for such as I. You have been the victim of an\ninfatuation and you want to disguise this fault by fancying that you\nlove me. But you do not--unless perhaps my outer self attracts you. And\nthen your love is no better than mine. But I cannot be satisfied with\nthat, and your real love I can never awaken.\n\nJULIE. Are you sure of that?\n\nJEAN. You mean that we could get along with such an arrangement? There's\nno doubt about my loving you--you are beautiful, you are elegant--[Goes\nto her and takes her hand] accomplished, lovable when you wish to be,\nand the flame that you awaken in man does not die easily. [Puts arm\naround her.] You are like hot wine with strong spices, and your lips--\n\n[Tries to kiss her. Julie pulls herself away slowly.]\n\nJULIE. Leave me--I'm not to be won this way.\n\nJEAN. How then? Not with caresses and beautiful words? Not by thoughts\nfor the future, to save humiliation? How then?\n\nJULIE. How? I don't know. I don't know! I shrink from you as I would\nfrom a rat. But I cannot escape from you.\n\nJEAN. Escape with me.\n\nJULIE. Escape? Yes, we must escape.--But I'm so tired. Give me a glass\nof wine. [Jean fills a glass with wine, Julie looks at her watch.] We\nmust talk it over first for we have still a little time left.\n\n[She empties the glass and puts it out for more.]\n\nJEAN. Don't drink too much. It will go to your head.\n\nJULIE. What harm will that do?\n\nJEAN. What harm? It's foolish to get intoxicated. But what did you want\nto say?\n\nJULIE. We must go away, but we must talk first. That is, I must speak,\nfor until now you have done all the talking. You have told me about\nyour life--now I will tell you about mine, then we will know each other\nthrough and through before we start on our wandering together.\n\nJEAN. One moment, pardon. Think well whether you won't regret having\ntold your life's secrets.\n\nJULIE. Aren't you my friend?\n\nJEAN. Yes. Sometimes. But don't depend on me.\n\nJULIE. You only say that. And for that matter I have no secrets. You\nsee, my mother was not of noble birth. She was brought up with ideas of\nequality, woman's freedom and all that. She had very decided opinions\nagainst matrimony, and when my father courted her she declared that she\nwould never be his wife--but she did so for all that. I came into the\nworld against my mother's wishes, I discovered, and was brought up like\na child of nature by my mother, and taught everything that a boy must\nknow as well; I was to be an example of a woman being as good as a\nman--I was made to go about in boy's clothes and take care of the horses\nand harness and saddle and hunt, and all such things; in fact, all over\nthe estate women servants were taught to do men's work, with the result\nthat the property came near being ruined--and so we became the laughing\nstock of the countryside. At last my father must have awakened from his\nbewitched condition, for he revolted, and ran things according to his\nideas. My mother became ill--what it was I don't know, but she often had\ncramps and acted queerly--sometimes hiding in the attic or the orchard,\nand would even be gone all night at times. Then came the big fire which\nof course you have heard about. The house, the stables--everything was\nburned, under circumstances that pointed strongly to an incendiary, for\nthe misfortune happened the day after the quarterly insurance was\ndue and the premiums sent in by father were strangely delayed by his\nmessenger so that they arrived too late. [She fills a wine glass and\ndrinks.]\n\nJEAN. Don't drink any more.\n\nJULIE. Oh, what does it matter? My father was utterly at a loss to know\nwhere to get money to rebuild with. Then my mother suggested that he\ntry to borrow from a man who had been her friend in her youth--a brick\nmanufacturer here in the neighborhood. My father made the loan, but\nwasn't allowed to pay any interest, which surprised him. Then the house\nwas rebuilt. [Julie drinks again.] Do you know who burned the house?\n\nJEAN. Her ladyship, your mother?\n\nJULIE. Do you know who the brick manufacturer was?\n\nJEAN. Your mother's lover?\n\nJULIE. Do you know whose money it was?\n\nJEAN. Just a moment, that I don't know.\n\nJULIE. It was my mother's.\n\nJEAN. The Count's--that is to say, unless there was a contract.\n\nJULIE. There was no contract. My mother had some money which she had not\nwished to have in my father's keeping and therefore, she had entrusted\nit to her friend's care.\n\nJEAN. Who kept it.\n\nJULIE. Quite right--he held on to it. All this came to my father's\nknowledge. He couldn't proceed against him, wasn't allowed to pay his\nwife's friend, and couldn't prove that it was his wife's money. That was\nmy mother's revenge for his taking the reins of the establishment into\nhis own hands. At that time he was ready to shoot himself. Gossip had it\nthat he had tried and failed. Well, he lived it down--and my mother paid\nfull penalty for her misdeed. Those were five terrible years for me,\nas you can fancy. I sympathized with my father, but I took my mother's\npart, for I didn't know the true circumstances. Through her I learned to\ndistrust and hate men, and I swore to her never to be a man's slave.\n\nJEAN. But you became engaged to the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nJULIE. Just to make him my slave.\n\nJEAN. But that he didn't care to be.\n\nJULIE. He wanted to be, fast enough, but I grew tired of him.\n\nJEAN. Yes--I noticed that--in the stable-yard!\n\nJULIE. What do you mean?\n\nJEAN. I saw how he broke the engagement.\n\nJULIE. That's a lie. It was I who broke it. Did he say he broke it--the\nwretch!\n\nJEAN. I don't believe that he was a wretch. You hate men, Miss Julie.\n\nJULIE. Most of them. Sometimes one is weak--\n\nJEAN. You hate me?\n\nJULIE. Excessively. I could see you shot--\n\nJEAN. Like a mad dog?\n\nJULIE. Exactly!\n\nJEAN. But there is nothing here to shoot with. What shall we do then?\n\nJULIE [Rousing herself].We must get away from here--travel.\n\nJEAN. And torture each other to death?\n\nJULIE. No--to enjoy, a few days, a week--as long as we can. And then to\ndie.\n\nJEAN. Die! How silly. I think it's better to start the hotel.\n\nJULIE [Not heeding him]. By the Lake of Como where the sun is always\nshining, where the laurel is green at Christmas and the oranges glow.\n\nJEAN. The Lake of Como is a rain hole, I never saw any oranges there\nexcept on fruit stands. But it's a good resort, and there are many\nvillas to rent to loving couples. That's a very paying industry. You\nknow why? They take leases for half a year at least, but they usually\nleave in three weeks.\n\nJULIE [Naively]. Why after three weeks?\n\nJEAN. Why? They quarrel of course, but the rent must be paid all the\nsame. Then you re-let, and so one after another they come and go, for\nthere is plenty of love, although it doesn't last long.\n\nJULIE. Then you don't want to die with me?\n\nJEAN. I don't want to die at all, both because I enjoy living and\nbecause I regard suicide as a crime to Him who has given us life.\n\nJULIE. Then you believe in God?\n\nJEAN. Yes. Of course I do, and I go to church every other Sunday--But\nI'm tired of all this and I'm going to bed.\n\nJULIE. Do you think I would allow myself to be satisfied with such an\nending? Do you know what a man owes to a woman he hits-- --\n\nJEAN [Takes out a silver coin and throws it on the table]. Allow me, I\ndon't want to owe anything to anyone.\n\nJULIE [Pretending not to notice the insult]. Do you know what the law\ndemands?\n\nJEAN. I know that the law demands nothing of a woman who seduces a man.\n\nJULIE [Again not heeding him]. Do you see any way out of it but to\ntravel?--wed--and separate?\n\nJEAN. And if I protest against this misalliance?\n\nJULIE. Misalliance!\n\nJEAN. Yes, for me. For you see I have a finer ancestry than you, for I\nhave no fire-bug in my family.\n\nJULIE. How do you know?\n\nJEAN. You can't prove the contrary. We have no family record except that\nwhich the police keep. But your pedigree I have read in a book on the\ndrawing room table. Do you know who the founder of your family was? It\nwas a miller whose wife found favor with the king during the Danish War.\nSuch ancestry I have not.\n\nJULIE. This is my reward for opening my heart to anyone so unworthy,\nwith whom I have talked about my family honor.\n\nJEAN. Dishonor--yes, I said it. I told you not to drink because then one\ntalks too freely and one should never talk.\n\nJULIE. Oh, how I repent all this. If at least you loved me!\n\nJEAN. For the last time--what do you mean? Shall I weep, shall I jump\nover your riding whip, shall I kiss you, lure you to Lake Como for three\nweeks, and then--what do you want anyway? This is getting tiresome. But\nthat's the way it always is when you get mixed up in women's affairs.\nMiss Julie, I see that you are unhappy, I know that you suffer, but I\ncan't understand you. Among my kind there is no nonsense of this sort;\nwe love as we play when work gives us time. We haven't the whole day and\nnight for it like you.\n\nJULIE. You must be good to me and speak to me as though I were a human\nbeing.\n\nJEAN. Be one yourself. You spit on me and expect me to stand it.\n\nJULIE. Help me, help me. Only tell me what to do--show me a way out of\nthis!\n\nJEAN. In heaven's name, if I only knew myself.\n\nJULIE. I have been raving, I have been mad, but is there no means of\ndeliverance?\n\nJEAN. Stay here at home and say nothing. No one knows.\n\nJULIE. Impossible. These people know it, and Kristin.\n\nJEAN. They don't know it and could never suspect such a thing.\n\nJULIE [Hesitating]. But--it might happen again.\n\nJEAN. That is true.\n\nJULIE. And the consequences?\n\nJEAN [Frightened]. Consequences--where were my wits not to have thought\nof that! There is only one thing to do. Get away from here immediately.\nI can't go with you or they will suspect. You must go alone--away from\nhere--anywhere.\n\nJULIE. Alone? Where? I cannot.\n\nJEAN. You must--and before the Count returns. If you stay, we know how\nit will be. If one has taken a false step it's likely to happen again as\nthe harm has already been done, and one grows more and more daring\nuntil at last all is discovered. Write the Count afterward and confess\nall--except that it was I. That he could never guess, and I don't think\nhe'll be so anxious to know who it was, anyway.\n\nJULIE. I will go if you'll go with me.\n\nJEAN. Are you raving again? Miss Julie running away with her coachman?\nAll the papers would be full of it and that the Count could never live\nthrough.\n\nJULIE. I can't go--I can't stay. Help me, I'm so tired--so weary.\nCommand me, set me in motion--I can't think any more,--can't act--\n\nJEAN. See now, what creatures you aristocrats are! Why do you bristle up\nand stick up your noses as though you were the lords of creation. Very\nwell--I will command you! Go up and dress yourself and see to it that\nyou have travelling money and then come down. [She hesitates.] Go\nimmediately.\n\n[She still hesitates. He takes her hand and leads her to door.]\n\nJULIE. Speak gently to me, Jean.\n\nJEAN. A command always sounds harsh. Feel it yourself now.\n\n[Exit Julie.]\n\n[Jean draws a sigh of relief, seats himself by the table, takes out a\nnotebook and pencil and counts aloud now and then until Kristin comes\nin, dressed for church.]\n\nKRISTIN. My heavens, how it looks here. What's been going on?\n\nJEAN. Oh, Miss Julie dragged in the people. Have you been sleeping so\nsoundly that you didn't hear anything?\n\nKRISTIN. I've slept like a log.\n\nJEAN. And already dressed for church!\n\nKRISTIN. Ye-es, [Sleepily] didn't you promise to go to early service\nwith me?\n\nJEAN. Yes, quite so, and there you have my stock and front. All right.\n\n[He seats himself. Kristin putting on his stock.]\n\nJEAN [Sleepily]. What is the text today?\n\nKRISTIN. St. John's Day! It is of course about the beheading of John the\nBaptist.\n\nJEAN. I'm afraid it will be terribly long drawn out--that. Hey, you're\nchoking me. I'm so sleepy, so sleepy.\n\nKRISTIN. What have you been doing up all night? You are actually green\nin the face.\n\nJEAN. I have been sitting here talking to Miss Julie.\n\nKRISTIN. Oh you don't know your place.\n\n[Pause.]\n\nJEAN. Listen, Kristin.\n\nKRISTIN. Well?\n\nJEAN. It's queer about her when you think it over.\n\nKRISTIN. What is queer?\n\nJEAN. The whole thing.\n\n[Pause. Kristin looks at half empty glasses on table.]\n\nKRISTIN. Have you been drinking together, too?\n\nJEAN. Yes!\n\nKRISTIN. For shame. Look me in the eye.\n\nJEAN. Yes.\n\nKRISTIN. Is it possible? Is it possible?\n\nJEAN [After reflecting]. Yes, it is.\n\nKRISTIN. Ugh! That I would never have believed. For shame, for shame!\n\nJEAN. You are not jealous of her?\n\nKRISTIN. No, not of her. But if it had been Clara or Sophie--then I\nwould have scratched your eyes out. So that is what has happened--how I\ncan't understand! No, that wasn't very nice!\n\nJEAN. Are you mad at her?\n\nKRISTIN. No, but with you. That was bad of you, very bad. Poor girl. Do\nyou know what--I don't want to be here in this house any longer where\none cannot respect one's betters.\n\nJEAN. Why should one respect them?\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, you can say that, you are so smart. But I don't want to\nserve people who behave so. It reflects on oneself, I think.\n\nJEAN. Yes, but it's a comfort that they're not a bit better than we.\n\nKRISTIN. No, I don't think so, for if they are not better there's no\nuse in our trying to better ourselves in this world. And to think of the\nCount! Think of him who has had so much sorrow all his days? No, I don't\nwant to stay in this house any longer! And to think of it being with\nsuch as you! If it had been the Lieutenant--\n\nJEAN. What's that?\n\nKRISTIN. Yes! He was good enough, to be sure, but there's a difference\nbetween people just the same. No, this I can never forget. Miss Julie\nwho was always so proud and indifferent to men! One never would believe\nthat she would give herself--and to one like you! She who was ready to\nhave Diana shot because she would run after the gatekeeper's mongrels.\nYes, I say it--and here I won't stay any longer and on the twenty-fourth\nof October I go my way.\n\nJEAN. And then?\n\nKRISTIN. Well, as we've come to talk about it, it's high time you looked\naround for something else, since we're going to get married.\n\nJEAN. Well, what'll I look for? A married man couldn't get a place like\nthis.\n\nKRISTIN. No, of course not. But you could take a gatekeeper's job or\nlook for a watchman's place in some factory. The government's plums are\nfew, but they are sure. And then the wife and children get a pension--\n\nJEAN [With a grimace]. That's all very fine--all that, but it's not\nexactly in my line to think about dying for my wife and children just\nnow. I must confess that I have slightly different aspirations.\n\nKRISTIN. Aspirations? Aspirations--anyway you have obligations. Think of\nthose, you.\n\nJEAN. Don't irritate me with talk about my obligations. I know my own\nbusiness. [He listens.] We'll have plenty of time for all this some\nother day. Go and get ready and we'll be off to church.\n\nKRISTIN [Listening]. Who's that walking upstairs?\n\nJEAN. I don't know--unless it's Clara.\n\nKRISTIN [Starting to go]. It could never be the Count who has come home\nwithout anyone hearing him?\n\nJEAN [Frightened]. The Count! I can't believe that. He would have rung\nthe bell.\n\nKRISTIN. God help us! Never have I been mixed up in anything like this!\n\n[Exit Kristin. The sun has risen and lights up the scene. Presently the\nsunshine comes in through windows at an angle. Jean goes to door and\nmotions. Enter Julie, dressed for travelling, carrying a small bird cage\ncovered with a cloth, which she places on a chair.]\n\nJULIE. I am ready!\n\nJEAN. Hush, Kristin is stirring!\n\n[Julie frightened and nervous throughout following scene.]\n\nJULIE. Does she suspect anything?\n\nJEAN. She knows nothing. But, good heavens, how you look!\n\nJULIE. Why?\n\nJEAN. You are pale as a ghost.\n\nJULIE [Sighs]. Am I? Oh, the sun is rising, the sun!\n\nJEAN. And now the troll's spell is broken.\n\nJULIE. The trolls have indeed been at work this night. But, Jean,\nlisten--come with me, I have money enough.\n\nJEAN. Plenty?\n\nJULIE. Enough to start with. Go with me for I can't go alone--today,\nmidsummer day. Think of the stuffy train, packed in with the crowds of\npeople staring at one; the long stops at the stations when one would\nbe speeding away. No, I cannot, I cannot! And then the memories,\nchildhood's memories of midsummer day--the church decorated with birch\nbranches and syringa blossoms; the festive dinner table with relations\nand friends, afternoon in the park, music, dancing, flowers and\ngames--oh, one may fly, fly, but anguish and remorse follow in the pack\nwagon.\n\nJEAN. I'll go with you--if we leave instantly--before it's too late.\n\nJULIE. Go and dress then. [She takes up bird cage.]\n\nJEAN. But no baggage! That would betray us.\n\nJULIE. Nothing but what we can take in the coup\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n[Jean has picked up his hat.]\n\nJEAN. What have you there?\n\nJULIE. It's only my canary. I cannot, will not, leave it behind.\n\nJEAN. So we are to lug a bird cage with us. Are you crazy? Let go of it.\n\nJULIE. It is all I take from home. The only living creature that cares\nfor me. Don't be hard--let me take it with me.\n\nJEAN. Let go the cage and don't talk so loud. Kristin will hear us.\n\nJULIE. No, I will not leave it to strange hands. I would rather see it\ndead.\n\nJEAN. Give me the creature. I'll fix it.\n\nJULIE. Yes, but don't hurt it. Don't--no, I cannot.\n\nJEAN. Let go. I can.\n\nJULIE [Takes the canary from cage]. Oh, my little siren. Must your\nmistress part with you?\n\nJEAN. Be so good as not to make a scene. Your welfare, your life, is at\nstake. So--quickly. [Snatches bird from her and goes to chopping block\nand takes up meat chopper]. You should have learned how to chop off a\nchicken's head instead of shooting with a revolver. [He chops off the\nbird's head]. Then you wouldn't swoon at a drop of blood.\n\nJULIE [Shrieks]. Kill me, too. Kill me! You who can butcher an innocent\nbird without a tremble. Oh, how I shrink from you. I curse the moment I\nfirst saw you. I curse the moment I was conceived in my mother's womb.\n\nJEAN. Come now! What good is your cursing, let's be off.\n\nJULIE [Looks toward chopping block as though obsessed by thought of the\nslain bird]. No, I cannot. I must see-- --hush, a carriage is passing.\nDon't you think I can stand the sight of blood? You think I am weak.\nOh, I should like to see your blood flowing--to see your brain on the\nchopping block, all your sex swimming in a sea of blood. I believe I\ncould drink out of your skull, bathe my feet in your breast and eat your\nheart cooked whole. You think I am weak; you believe that I love you\nbecause my life has mingled with yours; you think that I would carry\nyour offspring under my heart, and nourish it with my blood--give birth\nto your child and take your name! Hear, you, what are you called, what\nis your family name? But I'm sure you have none. I should be \"Mrs.\nGate-Keeper,\" perhaps, or \"Madame Dumpheap.\" You dog with my collar on,\nyou lackey with my father's hallmark on your buttons. I play rival to my\ncook--oh--oh--oh! You believe that I am cowardly and want to run away.\nNo, now I shall stay. The thunder may roll. My father will return--and\nfind his desk broken into--his money gone! Then he will ring--that bell.\nA scuffle with his servant--then sends for the police--and then I tell\nall--everything! Oh, it will be beautiful to have it all over with--if\nonly that were the end! And my father--he'll have a shock and die, and\nthen that will be the end. Then they will place his swords across the\ncoffin--and the Count's line is extinct. The serf's line will continue\nin an orphanage, win honors in the gutter and end in prison.\n\nJEAN. Now it is the king's blood talking. Splendid, Miss Julie! Only\nkeep the miller in his sack.\n\n[Enter Kristin with prayer-book in hand.]\n\nJULIE [Hastening to Kristin and falls in her arms as though seeking\nprotection]. Help me, Kristin, help me against this man.\n\nKRISTIN [Cold and unmoved]. What kind of performance is this for a holy\nday morning? What does this mean--this noise and fuss?\n\nJULIE. Kristin, you are a woman,--and my friend. Beware of this wretch.\n\nJEAN [A little embarrassed and surprised]. While the ladies are arguing\nI'll go and shave myself.\n\n[Jean goes, R.]\n\nJULIE. You must understand me--you must listen to me.\n\nKRISTIN. No--I can't understand all this bosh. Where may you be going in\nyour traveling dress?--and he had his hat on! Hey?\n\nJULIE. Listen to me, Kristin, listen to me and I'll tell you everything.\n\nKRISTIN. I don't want to know anything--\n\nJULIE. You must listen to me--\n\nKRISTIN. What about? Is it that foolishness with Jean? That doesn't\nconcern me at all. That I won't be mixed up with, but if you're trying\nto lure him to run away with you then we must put a stop to it.\n\nJULIE [Nervously]. Try to be calm now Kristin, and listen to me. I can't\nstay here and Jean can't stay here. That being true, we must leave--\n--Kristin.\n\nKRISTIN. Hm, hm!\n\nJULIE [Brightening up]. But I have an idea--what if we three should\ngo--away--to foreign parts. To Switzerland and set up a hotel\ntogether--I have money you see--and Jean and I would back the whole\nthing, you could run the kitchen. Won't that be fine? Say yes, now--and\ncome with us--there everything would be arranged--say yes! [Throws her\narms around Kristin and coaxes her].\n\nKRISTIN [Cold and reflecting]. Hm--hm!\n\nJULIE [Presto tempo]. You have never been out and traveled, Kristin.\nYou shall look about you in the world. You can't believe how pleasant\ntraveling on a train is--new faces continually, new countries--and\nwe'll go to Hamburg--and passing through we'll see the zoological\ngardens--that you will like--then we'll go to the theatre and hear the\nopera--and when we reach Munich there will be the museum--there are\nRubins and Raphaels and all the big painters that you know--you have\nheard of Munich--where King Ludwig lived--the King, you know, who went\nmad. Then we'll see his palace--a palace like those in the Sagas--and\nfrom there it isn't far to Switzerland--and the Alps, the Alps mind you\nwith snow in mid-summer. And there oranges grow and laurel--green all\nthe year round if--[Jean is seen in the doorway R. stropping his razor\non the strop which he holds between his teeth and left hand. He listens\nand nods his head favorably now and then. Julie continues, tempo\nprestissimo] And there we'll take a hotel and I'll sit taking the cash\nwhile Jean greets the guests--goes out and markets--writes letters--that\nwill be life, you may believe--then the train whistles--then the omnibus\ncomes--then a bell rings upstairs, then in the restaurant--and then\nI make out the bills--and I can salt them--you can't think how people\ntremble when they receive their bill--and you--you can sit like a\nlady--of course you won't have to stand over the stove--you can dress\nfinely and neatly when you show yourself to the people--and you with\nyour appearance--Oh, I'm not flattering, you can catch a husband some\nfine day--a rich Englishman perhaps--they are so easy to--[Slowing up]\nto catch-- --Then we'll be rich--and then we'll build a villa by Lake\nComo--to be sure it rains sometimes--but [becoming languid] the sun must\nshine too sometimes-- -- --although it seems dark-- -- --and if not--we\ncan at least travel homeward--and come back--here--or some other place.\n\nKRISTIN. Listen now. Does Miss Julie believe in all this?\n\n[Julie going to pieces.]\n\nJULIE. Do I believe in it?\n\nKRISTIN. Yes.\n\nJULIE [Tired]. I don't know. I don't believe in anything any more.\n[Sinks down on bench, and takes head in her hand on table.] In\nnothing--nothing!\n\nKRISTIN [Turns to R. and looks toward Jean]. So--you intended to run\naway?\n\nJEAN [Rather shamefaced comes forward and puts razor on table]. Run\naway? That's putting it rather strong. You heard Miss Julie's project, I\nthink it might be carried out.\n\nKRISTIN. Now listen to that! Was it meant that I should be her cook--\n\nJEAN [Sharply]. Be so good as to use proper language when you speak of\nyour mistress.\n\nKRISTIN. Mistress?\n\nJEAN. Yes.\n\nKRISTIN. No--hear! Listen to him!\n\nJEAN. Yes, you listen--you need to, and talk less. Miss Julie is your\nmistress and for the same reason that you do not respect her now you\nshould not respect yourself.\n\nKRISTIN. I have always had so much respect for myself--\n\nJEAN. That you never had any left for others!\n\nKRISTIN. I have never lowered my position. Let any one say, if they can,\nthat the Count's cook has had anything to do with the riding master or\nthe swineherd. Let them come and say it!\n\nJEAN. Yes, you happened to get a fine fellow. That was your good luck.\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, a fine fellow--who sells the Count's oats from his stable.\n\nJEAN. Is it for you to say anything--you who get a commission on all the\ngroceries and a bribe from the butcher?\n\nKRISTIN. What's that?\n\nJEAN. And you can't have respect for your master and mistress any\nlonger--you, you!\n\nKRISTIN [Glad to change the subject]. Are you coming to church with me?\nYou need a good sermon for your actions.\n\nJEAN. No, I'm not going to church today. You can go alone--and confess\nyour doings.\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, that I shall do, and I shall return with so much\nforgiveness that there will be enough for you too. The Savior suffered\nand died on the cross for all our sins, and when we go to Him in faith\nand a repentant spirit he takes our sins on Himself.\n\nJULIE. Do you believe that, Kristin?\n\nKRISTIN. That is my life's belief, as true as I stand here. And that was\nmy childhood's belief that I have kept since my youth, Miss Julie. And\nwhere sin overflows, there mercy overflows also.\n\nJULIE. Oh, if I only had your faith. Oh, if--\n\nKRISTIN. Yes, but you see that is not given without God's particular\ngrace, and that is not allotted to all, that!\n\nJULIE. Who are the chosen?\n\nKRISTIN. That is the great secret of the Kingdom of Grace, and the Lord\nhas no respect for persons. But there the last shall be first.\n\nJULIE. But then has he respect for the last--the lowliest person?\n\nKRISTIN [Continuing]. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye\nof a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. That's\nthe way it is, Miss Julie. However--now I am going--alone. And on my\nway I shall stop in and tell the stable boy not to let any horses go out\nin case any one wants to get away before the Count comes home. Good bye.\n\n[Exit Kristin.]\n\nJEAN. Such a devil. And all this on account of your confounded canary!\n\nJULIE [Tired]. Oh, don't speak of the canary--do you see any way\nout--any end to this?\n\nJEAN [Thinking]. No.\n\nJULIE. What would you do in my place?\n\nJEAN. In your place--wait. As a noble lady, as a woman--fallen--I don't\nknow. Yes, now I know.\n\nJULIE [She takes up razor from table and makes gestures saying] This?\n\nJEAN. Yes. But _I_ should not do it, mark you, for there is a difference\nbetween us.\n\nJULIE. Because you are a man and I am a woman? What other difference is\nthere?\n\nJEAN. That very difference--of man and woman.\n\nJULIE [Razor in hand]. I want to do it--but I can't. My father couldn't\neither that time when he should have done it.\n\nJEAN. No, he was right, not to do it--he had to avenge himself first.\n\nJULIE. And now my mother revenges herself again through me.\n\nJEAN. Haven't you loved your father, Miss Julie?\n\nJULIE. Yes, deeply. But I have probably hated him too, I must\nhave--without being aware of it. And it is due to my father's training\nthat I have learned to scorn my own sex. Between them both they\nhave made me half man, half woman. Whose is the fault for what has\nhappened--my father's? My mother's? My own? I haven't anything of my\nown. I haven't a thought which was not my father's--not a passion that\nwasn't my mother's. And last of all from my betrothed the idea that all\npeople are equal. For that I now call him a wretch. How can it be my\nown fault then? Throw the burden on Jesus as Kristin did? No, I am too\nproud, too intelligent, thanks to my father's teaching.-- --And that a\nrich man cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven--that is a lie, and Kristin,\nwho has money in the savings bank--she surely cannot enter there. Whose\nis the fault? What does it concern us whose fault it is? It is I who\nmust bear the burden and the consequences.\n\nJEAN. Yes, but-- --\n\n[Two sharp rings on bell are heard. Julie starts to her feet. Jean\nchanges his coat.]\n\nJEAN. The Count--has returned. Think if Kristin has-- [Goes up to\nspeaking tube and listens.]\n\nJULIE. Now he has seen the desk!\n\nJEAN [Speaking in the tube]. It is Jean, Excellency. [Listens]. Yes,\nExcellency. [Listens].Yes, Excellency,--right away--immediately,\nExcellency. Yes--in half an hour.\n\nJULIE [In great agitation]. What did he say? In Heaven's name, what did\nhe say?\n\nJEAN. He wants his boots and coffee in a half hour.\n\nJULIE. In half an hour then. Oh, I'm so tired--I'm incapable of feeling,\nnot able to be sorry, not able to go, not able to stay, not able to\nlive--not able to die. Help me now. Command me--I will obey like a dog.\nDo me this last service--save my honor. Save his name. You know what\nI have the will to do--but cannot do. You will it and command me to\nexecute your will.\n\nJEAN. I don't know why--but now I can't either.--I don't understand\nmyself. It is absolutely as though this coat does it--but I can't\ncommand you now. And since the Count spoke to me-- --I can't account for\nit--but oh, it is that damned servant in my back--I believe if the Count\ncame in here now and told me to cut my throat I would do it on the spot.\n\nJULIE. Make believe you are he--and I you. You could act so well a\nlittle while ago when you knelt at my feet. Then you were a nobleman--or\nhaven't you ever been at the theatre and seen the hypnotist--[Jean\nnods] He says to his subject \"Take the broom,\" and he takes it; he says,\n\"Sweep,\" and he sweeps.\n\nJEAN. Then the subject must be asleep!\n\nJULIE [Ecstatically]. I sleep already. The whole room is like smoke\nbefore me--and you are like a tall black stove, like a man clad in black\nclothes with a high hat; and your eyes gleam like the hot coals when\nthe fire is dying; and your face a white spot like fallen ashes. [The\nsunshine is coming in through the windows and falls on Jean. Julie\nrubs her hands as though warming them before a fire]. It is so warm and\ngood--and so bright and quiet!\n\nJEAN [Takes razor and puts it in her hand]. There is the broom, go now\nwhile it's bright--out to the hay loft--and--[He whispers in her ear.]\n\nJULIE [Rousing herself]. Thanks. And now I go to rest. But tell me\nthis--the foremost may receive the gift of Grace? Say it, even if you\ndon't believe it.\n\nJEAN. The foremost? No, I can't say that. But wait, Miss Julie--you are\nno longer among the foremost since you are of the lowliest.\n\nJULIE. That's true, I am the lowliest--the lowliest of the lowly. Oh,\nnow I can't go. Tell me once more that I must go.\n\nJEAN. No, now I cannot either--I cannot.\n\nJULIE. And the first shall be last-- -- --\n\nJEAN. Don't think. You take my strength from me, too, so that I become\ncowardly.--What-- --I thought I heard the bell!-- -- No! To be afraid\nof the sound of a bell! But it's not the bell--it's someone behind the\nbell, the hand that sets the bell in motion--and something else that\nsets the hand in motion. But stop your ears, stop your ears. Then he\nwill only ring louder and keep on ringing until it's answered--and then\nit is too late! Then come the police and then--[Two loud rings on\nbell are heard, Jean falls in a heap for a moment, but straightens up\nimmediately.] It is horrible! But there is no other way. Go!\n\n[Countess Julie goes out resolutely.]\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE OUTLAW\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n     THORFINN, Erl of Iceland\n     VALGERD, his wife\n     GUNL\u00c3\u0096D, their daughter\n     GUNNAR, a Crusader\n     ORM, a minstrel, foster brother to Thorfinn\n     A THRALL\n     A MESSENGER\n\nAction takes place in Iceland.\n\n\n\n[SCENE--A hut, door at back, window-holes, right and, left, closed by\nbig heavy wooden shutters. Wooden benches against walls, the high bench,\na sort of rude throne, at left. The uprights of this high beach are\ncarved with images of the gods Odin and Thor. From the wall beams hang\nswords, battle axes and shields. Near the high bench stands a harp.\nGunl\u00c3\u00b6d stands at an open window-hole peering out; through the opening\none gets a glimpse of the sea lighted by the aurora borealis. Valgerd\nsits by the fire, which is in the middle of the room, spinning.]\n\nVALGERD. Close the window-hole.\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d is silent.]\n\nVALGERD. Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Did you speak, mother?\n\nVALGERD. What are you doing?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I am watching the sea.\n\nVALGERD. When will you learn to forget?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Take everything away from me but memories!\n\nVALGERD. Look forward--not back.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Who reproaches the strong viking who looks back when he is\nquitting his native strand?\n\nVALGERD. You have had three winters to make your farewell.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You speak truly--three winters! For here never came a summer!\n\nVALGERD. When the floating ice melts, then shall spring be here.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. The Northern Lights melt no ice.\n\nVALGERD. Nor your tears.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You never saw me weep.\n\nVALGERD. But I have heard you. As long as you do that, you are a child.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I am not a child.\n\nVALGERD. If you would be a woman, suffer in silence.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I'll cast sorrow from me, mother.\n\nVALGERD. No, no--bury it, as your deepest treasure. The seed must not\nlie on top of the earth if it would sprout and ripen. You have a deep\nsorrow. It should bear great gladness--and great peace.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [After a pause]. I shall forget.\n\nVALGERD. Everything?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I shall try.\n\nVALGERD. Can you forget your father's hardness?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. That I have forgotten.\n\nVALGERD. Can you forget that there was a time when your fore-fathers'\ndwelling stood on Br\u00c3\u00b6vikens' strand? Where the south wind sang in the\noak wood when the ice-bound seas ran free--where the hemlocks gave forth\ntheir fragrance and the finches twittered among the linden trees--and\nBalder, the God of spring and joy, lulled you to sleep on the green\nmeadows? Can you forget all this, while you listen to the sea gulls'\nplaints on these bare rocks and cliffs, and the cold storms out of the\nnorth howl through the stunted birches?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes!\n\nVALGERD. Can you forget the friend of your childhood from whom your\nfather tore you to save you from the white Christ?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [in desperation]. Yes, yes!\n\nVALGERD. You are weeping.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [Disturbed]. Some one is walking out there. Perhaps father is\ncoming home.\n\nVALGERD. Will you bear in mind every day without tears that we now dwell\nin the land of ice--fugitives from the kingdom of Svea and hated here by\nthe Christ-men? But we have suffered no loss of greatness, although\nwe have not been baptized and kissed the bishop's hand. Have you ever\nspoken to any of the Christians since we have been here?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [After a pause]. No. Tell me, mother, is it true that father is\nto be Erl here in Iceland, too?\n\nVALGERD. Don't let that trouble you, child.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Then I'm afraid he will fare badly with the Christians.\n\nVALGERD. You fear that?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Some one is out there.\n\nVALGERD [Anxiously]. Did you see the ship lying in the inlet this\nmorning?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. With heart-felt gladness!\n\nVALGERD. Bore it the figure-head of Thorfinn?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. That I could not make out.\n\nVALGERD. Have a care, girl.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Is it tonight that I may go out?\n\nVALGERD. Tomorrow--that you know well.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D Mother!\n\nVALGERD [Going]. Mind the fire. [Valgerd goes.]\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d looks after her mother, then cautiously takes from her breast a\ncrucifix, puts it on the high bench and falls on her knees.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Christ, Christ, forgive me the lie I told. [Springs up noticing\nthe images of the gods on the high bench.] No, I cannot pray before\nthese wicked images. [She looks for another place.] Holy St. Olof,\nholy--oh, I can't remember how the bishop named her! God! God! Cast me\nnot into purgatory for this sin! I will repeat the whole long prayer\nof the monks--credo, credo--in patrem--oh, I have forgotten that too. I\nshall give five tall candles for the altar of the mother of God the next\ntime I go to the chapel--Credo, in patrem omnipotentem--[Kissing the\ncrucifix eagerly.]\n\n[A song is heard outside the hut accompanied by a lyre.]\n\n    A crusader went out to the Holy Land,\n    O, Christ, take the maiden's soul in hand,\n    And to your kingdom bring her!\n    I'll return, mayhap, when the spruce trees bloom.\n\n    Summers three he wanders far from thee,\n    Where nightingales sing their delight,\n    And masses he holds both day and night,\n    At the holy sepulchre's chapel.\n    I'll return, mayhap, when the spruce trees bloom.\n\n    When the palm trees bud on Jordan's strand,\n    Then makes he a prayer to God,\n    That he may return to his native land,\n    And press to his heart his love.\n    I'll return, my love, when the spruce trees bloom.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [At beginning of song springs up and then listens with more and\nmore agitation and eagerness. When the song is over she goes toward door\nto bolt it, but so slowly that Gunnar is able to enter before she slips\nthe bolt. Gunnar is clad in the costume of a crusader with a lyre swung\nacross his shoulder.]\n\nGUNNAR. Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d! [They embrace. Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d pulls away and goes toward door.]\nYou are afraid of me? What is it, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You never took me in your arms before!\n\nGUNNAR. We were children then!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D You are right--we were children then. What means that silver\nfalcon on your shield? I saw it on your ship's bow this morning, too.\n\nGUNNAR. You saw my ship--you knew my song, and you would have barred the\ndoor against me! What am I to understand, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Oh, ask me nothing! I am so unquiet of spirit but sit and let me\ntalk to you.\n\nGUNNAR [Sits]. You are silent.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You are silent, too.\n\nGUNNAR [Pulls her to his side]. Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d--has the snow fallen so\nheavily that memories have been chilled even the mountains here burst\nforth with fire--and you are cold as a snow wind--but speak--speak! Why\nare you here in Iceland--and what has happened?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Terrible things--and more may follow if you stay here\nlonger.--[Springs up]. Go, before my father comes.\n\nGUNNAR. Do you think I would leave you now--I, who have sought you for\nlong years? When I could not find you in the home land I went to the\nwars against the Saracens to seek you the other side of the grave. But\nmy time had not yet come; when the fourth spring came, I heard through\nwandering merchants that you were to be found here. Now I have found\nyou--and you wish me to leave you in this heathen darkness.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I am not alone!\n\nGUNNAR. Your father does not love you--your mother does not understand\nyou, and they are both heathen.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I have friends among the Christians.\n\nGUNNAR. Then you have become a Christian, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d!--the holy virgin has\nheard my prayer.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes, yes! Oh, let me kiss the cross you bear on your\nshoulder--that you got at the holy sepulchre!\n\nGUNNAR. Now I give you a brother Christian's kiss--the first, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d,\nyou have from me.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You must never kiss me again.\n\nGUNNAR. But tell me, how did you become a Christian?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. First I believed in my father--he was so strong; then I believed\nin my mother--she was so good; last I believed in you--you were so\nstrong and good--and so beautiful; and when you went away--I stood\nalone--myself I could never believe in--I was so weak; then I thought of\nyour God, whom you so often begged me to love--and I prayed to Him.\n\nGUNNAR. And the old gods--\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I have never been able to believe in them--although my father\ncommanded me to do so--they are wicked.\n\nGUNNAR. Who has taught you to pray? Who gave you the crucifix?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. The bishop.\n\nGUNNAR. And that no one knows?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. No--I have had to lie to my mother and that troubles me.\n\nGUNNAR. And your father hid you here so that the Christians should not\nget you?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes--and now he is expected home from Norway with followers as\nhe is to be Erl of the island.\n\nGUNNAR. God forbid!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes--yes--but you must not delay. He is expected home tonight.\n\nGUNNAR. Good--there beyond Hj\u00c3\u00a4rleif's headland lies my ship.--Out to\nsea! There is a land wind, and before the first cock's crow we shall be\nbeyond pursuit.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes! Yes!\n\nGUNNAR. Soon we should be at Osterg\u00c3\u00b6tland--where the summer is still\ngreen--and there you shall live in my castle which I have built where\nyour father's house stood.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Does not that still stand?\n\nGUNNAR. No--it was burned.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. By the Christians?\n\nGUNNAR. You are so passionate, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I suffer to say I would rather be a heathen.\n\nGUNNAR. What are you saying, girl!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [After a pause]. Forgive me, forgive me--I am in such a wild\nmood--and when I see the Christians, who should be examples, commit such\ndeeds--\n\nGUNNAR. Crush out that thought, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d--it is ungodly. Do you see this\nwreath?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Where did you gather it?\n\nGUNNAR. You recognize the flowers, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. They grew in my father's garden--may I keep them?\n\nGUNNAR. Gladly--but, why do you care to have them when we are going to\njourney there ourselves?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I shall look at them the long winter through--the hemlock shall\nremind me of the green woods and the anemones of the blue sky.\n\nGUNNAR. And when they are withered--\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Of that I do not think.\n\nGUNNAR. Then go with me from this drear land--far away, and there where\nour childhood was spent we will live as free as the birds among the\nflowers and sunshine. There you shall not go in stealth to the temple of\nthe Lord when the bells tell you of the Sabbath. Oh, you shall see the\nnew chapel with its vaulted roof and high pillared aisles. And hear the\nacolytes singing when the bishop lights the incense on the high altar.\nThere shall you solemnize the God service with those of Christ and you\nshall feel you heart cleansed of sin.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Shall I fly--leave my mother?\n\nGUNNAR. She will forgive you some time.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. But my father would call me cowardly and that I would never\nallow.\n\nGUNNAR. That you must endure for the sake of your belief.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Thorfinn's daughter was never cowardly.\n\nGUNNAR. Your father does not love you, and he will hate you when he\nknows of your conversion.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. That he may do--but he shall never despise me.\n\nGUNNAR. You surrender your love, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Love!--I remember--there was a maiden--she had a friend who\nwent away--after, she was never again glad--she only sat sewing silk and\ngold--what she was making no one knew--and when they asked her she\nwould only weep. And when they asked her why she wept, she never\nanswered--only wept. She grew pale of cheek and her mother made ready\nher shroud.--Then there came an old woman and she said it was love.\nGunnar,--I never wept when you went away as father says it is weak to\nshed tears; I never sewed silk and gold for that my mother has never\ntaught me to do--then had I not love?\n\nGUNNAR. You have often thought of me during these years?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I have dreamed so often of you, and this morning when I stood by\nthe window where I linger so willingly and, gazing over the sea, I saw\nyour ship come up out of the east, I became unquiet although I did not\nknow it was your ship.\n\nGUNNAR. Why do you gaze so willingly over the sea?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You ask many questions!\n\nGUNNAR. Why did you want to close the door against me?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Silent].\n\nGUNNAR. Why didn't you close it?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Silent].\n\nGUNNAR. Why are you silent?\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d bursts into tears.]\n\nGUNNAR. You weep, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d, and you know why? I know,--you love! [Takes\nher in his arms and kisses her.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Tearing herself away]. You must not kiss me! Go!\n\nGUNNAR. Yes--and you shall go with me.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I do not care to be commanded by you--and I shall not obey.\n\nGUNNAR. The volcano gives forth fire--and burns itself out!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You have destroyed my peace--forever! Go and let me forget you.\n\nGUNNAR. Do you know what the silver falcon with the ribbon stands for?\nIt is the symbol of the wild girl I shall tame.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [With force]. You! Go before I hate you!--No one yet has bent my\nwill!\n\nGUNNAR. The wild fire of the viking's blood still burns in your veins,\nbut it shall be quenched. A day and a night shall I wait for you. And\nyou will come--mild as a dove seeking shelter, although you now would\nfly above the clouds like a wild falcon. But I still hold the ribbon in\nmy hand--that is your love, which you cannot tear away. When twilight\nfalls again you will come. Till then, farewell. [Goes to the door and\nstops.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Silent.]\n\nGUNNAR. [Going.] Farewell.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. We shall see, proud knight, who comes first. When this garland\nshall bloom again, then shall I come. [Throws garland in fire. She\nwatches it burn in a thoughtful mood. When it is quite burnt she breaks\ninto tears again and falls on her knees.] God! God! Soften my proud\nspirit! Oh, that he should leave me! [Hastens to door. At same moment\nValgerd enters, passes Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d, and goes to fire.]\n\nVALGERD. Why did you not tend the fire?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Silent.]\n\nVALGERD [Putting her hand against Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d's heart]. You have a secret!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Yes, mother, yes.\n\nVALGERD. Hide it well.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Oh, I must speak--I can't bear it any longer.\n\nVALGERD. When saw you a mother who did not know a daughter's secrets?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Who told you mine?\n\nVALGERD [Harshly]. Dry your tears.\n\n[A pause.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Oh, let me go out--on the mountains--on the strand. It is so\nstifling here.\n\nVALGERD. Go up to the loft--and you can be alone. [Enter a thrall.] What\nwould you?\n\nTHRALL. The Erl's trumpets are heard beyond the rocks and the storm is\ngrowing.\n\nVALGERD. Has darkness fallen?\n\nTHRALL. Yes, and a terrible darkness it is.\n\n[A pause.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Send out a boat--two--as many as can be found.\n\nTHRALL. All the boats are out for the hunt.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Light beacon fires.\n\nTHRALL. All the fuel is so rain-soaked that we haven't had so much as a\ntwig on the hearth all the evening.\n\nVALGERD. Away!\n\nTHRALL. How will it go with the Erl?\n\nVALGERD. Does that concern you?\n\n[Thrall goes.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You have not forgotten your wrong!\n\nVALGERD. Nor my revenge! One should not lay hands on the daughter of an\nErl!\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. So be it. Now your moment has come--take your revenge--I'll\nshow you how--like this. [Takes a lighted torch.] Put this torch in the\nwindow-hole on the right and you wreck him. Put it in the left and you\nsave him--\n\nVALGERD [Interrupts]. Give me the torch and leave me.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. There is a sacrifice which can pacify your god's. Sacrifice your\nrevenge.\n\nVALGERD. [Takes torch, hesitates, and goes quickly to left window-hole\nand places it there. Trumpets are heard]. You struck me, Thorfinn--I\nswore revenge--I shall humble you with a kind deed.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [Unseen by Valgerd has entered and falls on her mother's neck].\nThanks, mother.\n\nVALGERD [Disconcerted]. Haven't you gone--\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Now I shall go. [Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d goes.]\n\nVALGERD [Alone by the window-hole]. You shout for help, you mighty man,\nwho always helped yourself. [Trumpets are heard.] Where is now your\nmight--where is your kingdom--[A gust of wind blows out the lighted\ntorch. Valgerd, terribly frightened, takes torch and lights it.] Oh, he\nwill perish! What shall I do? Pray? To whom? Odin? Njard? Ogir? I have\ncalled to them for four times ten years, but never have they answered. I\nhave sacrificed, but never have they helped. Thou, God, however you\nmay be called--Thou mighty one, who bids the sun to rise and set, thou\ntremendous one who rules over the winds and water--to you will I pray,\nto you will I sacrifice my revenge if you will save him.\n\n[Orm enters unnoticed.]\n\nORM. Good evening to you, Valgerd. Put on your cloak--the wind is sharp.\n\nVALGERD [Disconcerted, takes down torch and closes window-hole.]\nWelcome, Orm.\n\nORM. Thanks.\n\nVALGERD. How is it with you, Orm?\n\nORM. Tolerable enough---when one gets near the big logs.\n\nVALGERD [Irritated]. How went the journey I mean?\n\nORM. That is a long saga.\n\nVALGERD. Make it short.\n\nORM. Well, as you know, we fared to Norway, seeking men and timber.\n\nVALGERD. Orm!\n\nORM. Valgerd!\n\nVALGERD. You have not spoken a word of the Erl.\n\nORM. Have you asked a word about your mate?\n\nVALGERD. Where is he? Lives he?\n\nORM. I know not.\n\nVALGERD. You know not!--you, his foster brother? Where did you part from\nhim?\n\nORM. Far out in the gulf. It was merry out there you may believe. You\nshould have seen him swimming with my lyre in his hand. The sea-weed was\nso tangled in his beard and hair that one was tempted to believe that it\nwas Neptune himself. Just then came a wave as big as a house--\n\nVALGERD. And then?\n\nORM. And then--I saw my lyre no more.\n\nVALGERD. Orm! You jest while your lord and brother is perhaps perishing\nout there! I command you--go at once and seek him! Do you hear?\n\nORM. Why, what is the matter? You were never before so concerned about\nyour mate! You might find time to give me a drink of ale before I go.\n\nVALGERD. Warm your knees by the hearth. I shall go--and defy wind and\nstorm.\n\nORM. [Taking her hounds]. Woman, woman--after all, you are a woman!\n\nVALGERD [Angry]. Let go my hand.\n\nORM. Now the Erl is saved!\n\nVALGERD. Saved?\n\nORM. Yes, you have been given back to him--and that is his voice now.\n[Goes.]\n\n[Voices of Thorfinn and Orm are heard outside, Thorfinn laughing\nloudly.]\n\nVALGERD. The Erl comes--he laughs--that I have never heard before--oh,\nthere is something terrible approaching! [Wrings her hands.]\n\n[Enter Thorfinn and Orm.]\n\nTHORFINN [Laughing]. That was a murderous sight--\n\nORM. Yes, I promise you!\n\nVALGERD. Welcome home, mate.\n\nTHORFINN. Thanks, wife. Have you been out in the rain? Your eyes are\nwet.\n\nVALGERD. You are so merry!\n\nTHORFINN. Merry? Yes--yes.\n\nVALGERD. What became of your ships?\n\nORM. They went to the bottom--all but one.\n\nVALGERD [To Thorfinn]. And you can nevertheless be so gay?\n\nTHORFINN. Ho! Ho! Timber grows in plenty in the north!\n\nORM. Now perhaps we might have something life-giving.\n\nTHORFINN. Well said! Fetch some ale, wife, and let's be merry.\n\nORM. And we'll thank the gods who saved us.\n\nTHORFINN. When will you ever outgrow those sagas, Orm?\n\nORM. Why do you force your wife and daughter to believe in them?\n\nTHORFINN. Women folk should have gods.\n\nORM. Whom do you believe helped you out there in the storm?\n\nTHORFINN. I helped myself.\n\nORM. And yet you cried out to Ake-Thor when the big wave swallowed you.\n\nTHORFINN. There you lie.\n\nORM. Orm never lies.\n\nTHORFINN. Orm is a poet!\n\nORM. Thorfinn must have swallowed too much sea water when he cried for\nhelp to have such a bitter tongue.\n\nTHORFINN. Take care of your own tongue, Orm.\n\n[Valgerd with drinking horns.]\n\nVALGERD. Here, foster brothers, I drink to your oath of friendship and\nbetter luck for your next voyage.\n\nTHORFINN. I forbid you to speak of that again. [They drink. Thorfinn\ntakes horn hastily from mouth and asks] Where is the child?\n\nVALGERD [Troubled]. She is in the loft.\n\nTHORFINN. Call her hither.\n\nVALGERD. She's not well.\n\nTHORFINN [Looks sharply at Valgerd]. She shall--come!\n\nVALGERD. You don't mean that.\n\nTHORFINN. Did you hear the word?\n\nVALGERD. It is not your last.\n\nTHORFINN. A man has but one, though woman must always have the last.\n\nVALGERD [Weakly]. You mock me.\n\nTHORFINN. You are angry I believe.\n\nVALGERD. You laugh so much tonight.\n\n[Goes out.]\n\nTHORFINN. Orm! A thought comes to me.\n\nORM. If it's a great one you had better hide it. Great thoughts are\nscarce these days.\n\nTHORFINN. Did you notice my wife?\n\nORM. I never notice other men's wives.\n\nTHORFINN. How kindly and mild she was.\n\nORM. She pitied you.\n\nTHORFINN. Pitied me?\n\nORM. Yes, because sorrow that laughs is the laughter of death, she\nthought.\n\nTHORFINN. Woman cannot think.\n\nORM. No, not with her head, but with her heart. That's why she has a\nsmaller head but a bigger breast than we.\n\nTHORFINN. Forebodings of evil torture me.\n\nORM. Poor Thorfinn.\n\nTHORFINN. My child! Orm! When she comes do you bid her drink from the\nhorn to Asa-Odin.\n\nORM. The fox scents against, the wind. I understand.\n\nTHORFINN. Be ready--they come.\n\nORM. Be not hard with the child, Thorfinn, or you will have me to reckon\nwith.\n\n[Valgerd and Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d enter. The latter heavy with sleepiness.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Welcome home, father.\n\nTHORFINN. Do you speak truthfully?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. [Silent.]\n\nTHORFINN. You are ill, are you not?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I am not quite myself.\n\nTHORFINN. I fear so.\n\nORM [Waning a drinking horn over the fire]. Come, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d, and empty this\nsacred horn to Odin who saved your father from shipwreck.\n\n[All empty their horns except Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d.]\n\nTHORFINN [Tremblingly]. Drink, Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d.\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d throws the horn on floor and goes to Thorfinn and buries her\nhead in his lap.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Hear me, father. I am a Christian. Do with me what you will--my\nsoul you cannot destroy. God and the Saints will protect it.\n\n[Thorfinn is beside himself with grief and rage. Rises and pushes Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d\naway from him and tries to speak, but words fail him. Sits on his high\nbench again in silence. Orm goes to the women and speaks quietly to\nthem. They go toward door. Suddenly Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d turns.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. No! I won't go. I must speak that you, my father, may not go\nto the grave with a lie--for your whole life has been a lie! I shall\nsacrifice the child's respect--love I have never felt--and prove to you\nwhat terrible guilt you have gathered on your head. Know then, you have\ntaught me to hate--for when did you ever give me love--you taught me to\nfear the great Erl Thorfinn and you have succeeded, because I tremble\nbefore your harshness. I respect your many scars and great deeds, but\nyou never taught me to love my father. You always thrust me away when\nI wanted to come to you--you poisoned my soul and now you see God's\npunishment. You have made me a criminal--for such I am at this moment,\nbut it cannot be otherwise. Why do you hate my belief? Because it is\nlove and yours is hate! Oh, father, father, I want to kiss the clouds\nfrom your brow. I wanted to caress your white locks and make you forget\nthe sorrows that whitened them. I wanted to support you when your steps\nbegan to falter--Oh! forget what I have said--open your arms [falls on\nher knees] and take me to your heart. Look at me tenderly--just once\nbefore it is too late. Speak one word--[springs to her feet] Oh, your\nglance freezes me! You will not! I shall pray for power to love you.\n[Bursts into tears and goes out, followed by Valgerd, Orm goes forward\nto Thorfinn.]\n\nTHORFINN. Sing for me, Orm.\n\nORM. Orm sings nothing but lies.\n\nTHORFINN. Lie then.\n\nORM. Was the truth so bitter?\n\nTHORFINN. What do you say?\n\nORM. Never mind. You shall hear more from me later.\n\nTHORFINN. Orm, you are my friend!\n\nORM. H'm--of course!\n\nTHORFINN. I lack peace.\n\nORM. There are two ways to gain peace: one is never to do anything one\nregrets--the other never to regret anything one does!\n\nTHORFINN. But if one has already done what one regrets?\n\nORM. Thorfinn! That is to say, you regret your harshness toward your\nchild?\n\nTHORFINN [Angry]. I regret nothing. And as far as the child is concerned\nyou had better hold your tongue!\n\nORM. Hear you, Thorfinn--have you ever thought about what your life has\nbeen?\n\nTHORFINN. Thinking is for old women--doing has been my life.\n\nORM. What do you intend to do now?\n\nTHORFINN. What do I intend to do now?\n\nORM. Yes.\n\nTHORFINN [Shaken, is silent.]\n\nORM. You see how even a little thought struck you--think then if a big\nthought should come. Why don't you dare to look back? Because you are\nafraid of the sights you would see.\n\nTHORFINN. Let the past remain buried.\n\nORM. No, I shall tear the corpses from their graves and they shall\nstare at you with their empty orbits until you quake with anguish and\nfear--and you shall see that with all your strength you were not a man.\n\nTHORFINN. What are you saying, madman?\n\nORM. Yes, shout--you are still a boy. Yes, you--I have seen big, tall\nchildren with bushy beards and gray hairs and crooked backs as well.\n\nTHORFINN. Hold your tongue, Orm.\n\nORM. Shout until the hut trembles--the truth you cannot shout down.\n\nTHORFINN. Silence, before I strike you!\n\nORM. Strike! Strike me to death--tear the tongue out of my mouth--with\ncopper trumpets shall the truth be blasted into your ears, \"Your life\nhas been a lie.\"\n\nTHORFINN [With repressed anger and pain]. Orm, I beg of you--speak no\nmore.\n\nORM. Yes, Thorfinn, I shall speak. Feel how the earth trembles under\nyou. That means an earthquake! The whole earth trembles these days,\nfor she is about to give birth. She is to bring forth in dire pain a\nglorious hero. Open your eyes and look. Do you see how the east wars\nwith the west? It is love's first conflict--the new bride trembles under\nthe elder's embraces, she struggles and suffers--but soon she shall\nrejoice, and thousands of torches shall be lighted and radiate peace and\ngladness, because he shall be born, the young, the strong, the beautiful\nprinceling, who shall rule over all peoples and whose sceptre is called\nlove and whose crown is called light and whose name is the new age!\nThorfinn! do you remember the saga about Thor at Utgorda Loake? He\nlifted the cat so high that the trolls turned pale; he drank so deep\nfrom the horn that the trolls trembled--but when the old woman felled\nhim to his knees then the trolls laughed. It was the age that vanquished\nhim, and it is the age that you have warred against, and which has slain\nyou--it is the lord of the age, it is God who has crushed you.\n\nTHORFINN. I have never known any god but my own strength, and that god I\nbelieve in!\n\nORM. You don't know him--you who have so long been lying at feud with\nhim. It was he who drove you from your native land, and you thought\nyou were escaping him. It was he who struck your ships to splinters and\nswallowed up your treasures and ended your power. It was he who\ntore your child from you--and you said you lacked peace! It was\nhe--[Messenger enters.]\n\nMESSENGER. Are you the Erl Thorfinn.\n\nTHORFINN. I am.\n\nMESSENGER. You committed the coast massacre at Reyd-fiord last spring?\n\nTHORFINN [Undisturbed]. I did.\n\nMESSENGER. You plundered and burned Hallfred at Thorvalla?\n\nTHORFINN. Yes.\n\nMESSENGER. And then you disappeared.\n\nTHORFINN [Silent.]\n\nMESSENGER. The Allting has now declared you an outlaw and pronounced you\na felon. Your house is to be burned to the ground, and whomsoever will\nmay take your life. Your enemies are at hand, therefore fly while there\nis yet time--make your escape this night.\n\n[Messenger goes out and there is a long pause.]\n\nORM. Do you know who that was?\n\nTHORFINN. You may well ask that.\n\nORM. It--was a messenger from that old woman who felled Thor--the age!\n\nTHORFINN. You talk like an old woman.\n\nORM. This age does not want to use force, but you have violated it and\nit strikes you.\n\nTHORFINN. This age cannot suffer strength, therefore it worships\nweakness.\n\nORM. When you came to this island you swore peace. You have broken your\noath, you have violated your honor, therefore you must die like a felon.\n\nTHORFINN. Do you too call me a felon?\n\nORM. Yes.\n\nTHORFINN. Would you dare to break an oath? Would you dare to in called a\nfelon?\n\nORM [Silent.]\n\nTHORFINN. Poor wretch! It is you who put shackles on me when I want to\nfly! Like a snake you coil yourself around my legs. Let go of me!\n\nORM. We have sworn the oath of foster-brothers.\n\nTHORFINN. I break it!\n\nORM. You cannot.\n\nTHORFINN. Then I'll kick you out of the way.\n\nORM. That will be our death.\n\nTHORFINN. Are you a man, Orm?\n\nORM. I've become a poet only.\n\nTHORFINN. Therefore you have become nothing.\n\nORM. I knew what I wanted, but I could not attain it. You could attain\nanything, but did not know what you wanted.\n\nTHORFINN. Thanks for your song. Farewell.\n\nORM. Who will sing your death song?\n\nTHORFINN. The ravens no doubt.\n\nORM. Do you dare to die, Thorfinn?\n\nTHORFINN. I dare more! I dare to be forgotten!\n\nORM. You were always stronger than I. Farewell. We'll meet again. [Orm\ngoes out.]\n\nTHORFINN. Alone! Alone! Alone! [Pause.] I remember one autumn when the\nequinoctial storm raged over England's sun my dragon ship was wrecked\nand I was tossed up on the rocks alone. Afterward everything grew\ncalm. Oh, what long days and nights! Only the cloudless sky above\nand endlessly the deep blue sea around me. Not a sound of any living\ncreature! Not even the gulls to wake me with their screeching! Not even\na breeze stirred the waves to lap against the stones. It seemed as if I\nmyself were dead! Loudly I talked and shouted, but the sound of my voice\nfrightened me, and thirst bound my tongue. Only the even beat of my\nheart in my breast told me that I was alive! But after a moment's\nlistening I heard it no longer and, trembling, I rose to my feet, and so\nit was each time until, senseless, I swooned. When at last I revived I\nheard the slow beats of a heart beside me and a deep breathing that was\nnot mine, and courage revived in my soul. I looked about--it was a\nseal seeking rest; it gazed at me with its moist eyes as if filled with\ncompassion for me. Now I was no longer alone! I stretched out my hand to\ncaress its rough body; then it fled and I was doubly alone. Again I am\non the rocks! What do I fear? Yes, loneliness! What is loneliness? It\nis I, myself! Who am I then to fear myself? Am I not Erl Thorfinn, the\nstrong, who has bowed thousands of wills to his? Who never asked for\nfriendship or love but himself bore his own sorrows! No! No! I am\nanother! And therefore Thorfinn the strong fears Thorfinn the weak!\nWho stole my strength? Who struck me down? Was it the sea? Have I not\nvanquished the sea three times ten voyages? And it, has defeated me but\nonce--but then to the death! It was the stronger. It was a God. But who\nsubdued the sea that lately raged? Who? Who? Who? It was the stronger!\nWho are you then, the stronger! Oh, answer, that I may believe! He does\nnot answer!--All is silent!--Again I hear my heart beating. Oh, help,\nhelp! I am cold, I freeze--[Goes to door and calls Valgerd.]\n\n[Enter a thrall.]\n\nTHRALL. You called, Master Erl?\n\nTHORFINN [Recovering himself]. You were mistaken.\n\nTHRALL. Yes, master.\n\nTHORFINN. How many men are we?\n\nTHRALL. Oh--half three score I think.\n\nTHORFINN. Are you afraid to die, thrall?\n\nTHRALL. How can I be when I believe that I shall be saved?\n\n[Crosses himself.]\n\nTHORFINN. What does that mean?\n\nTHRALL. The bishop has taught us to do that.\n\nTHORFINN. I forgot that you are a Christian.\n\nTHRALL. Do you wish me to stay in your service when you are a heathen?\n\nTHORFINN. I want to prove how little I respect their belief. We must put\ndouble bolts on the north gate!\n\nTHRALL. Yes, Master, but the belief is stronger than a hundred bolts.\n\nTHORFINN. Who questioned you? [Pause.] What happened when you became\nChristians here on the island?\n\nTHRALL. Oh, it was easier than any one would think. They only poured\nwater on us and the bishop read from a big book and then they gave us\neach a white shirt.\n\nTHORFINN. Tell the twelve strongest to take their new axes--do you hear?\n\nTHRALL [Starting to go]. Yes, Master.\n\nTHORFINN. Wait. [Pause.] Do you remember what was written in that big\nbook?\n\nTHRALL. I don't remember much of it, but there was something about two\nthieves who were hanged on crosses along with the Son of God. But one of\nthem went to heaven.\n\nTHORFINN. Did they pour water on him, too?\n\nTHRALL. The bishop didn't say.\n\nTHORFINN. Do you know whether there are any horses in the stable?\n\nTHRALL. They must be out at pasture--but I'll see. [Starts to go.]\n\nTHORFINN. You mustn't leave me--Stay. [Pause.] Could you die in peace\nthis night?\n\nTHRALL. Yes, if I only had time for a prayer first.\n\nTHORFINN. Does that bring peace to one?\n\nTHRALL. Oh, yes, Master.\n\nTHORFINN [Rises, takes up a goblet]. This you shall have if you will\npray for me.\n\nTHRALL. That's not enough.\n\nTHORFINN. You shall have ten, but if you ever tell of it--I'll take your\nlife.\n\nTHRALL. It would not help even if you gave me a hundred. You must pray\nyourself.\n\nTHORFINN. I cannot, but I command you to pray.\n\nTHRALL. I will obey--but you will see that it does not help. [Praying.]\nJesus Christ, have pity on this poor sinner who begs for mercy.\n\nTHORFINN. That's a lie. I never begged for anything!\n\nTHRALL. You see now that it doesn't help.\n\nTHORFINN. Give me my armor and help me buckle.\n\nTHRALL [Helping]. You are not keeping still. I can't fasten the buckles.\n\nTHORFINN. Wretch!\n\nTHRALL. But your whole body is shaking.\n\nTHORFINN. That's a lie!\n\n[Valgerd and Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d enter.]\n\nTHRALL. May I go now?\n\nTHORFINN. Go.\n\nVALGERD [Coming forward]. You called me.\n\nTHORFINN. That's not true.\n\nVALGERD. Your enemies are upon you.\n\nTHORFINN. What does that concern you?\n\nVALGRED. Make ready. I have heard what has come to pass.\n\nTHORFINN. Then it is best that you [indicating both Valgerd and Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d]\nhide yourselves in the cellar passage.\n\n[Another messenger enters.]\n\nMESSENGER. Erl Thorfinn, we are here. Will you surrender to our superior\nstrength?\n\nTHORFINN [Silent.]\n\nMESSENGER. You do not answer. Let the women go as we shall burn your\nhome. [Thorfinn is silent.] Your answer!\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d who has been standing by the door, comes forward and takes a\nbattle axe from wall.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I give you your answer! Ill must Erl Thorfinn have brought up\nhis daughter and little would his wife have loved him if they should\ndesert him now. Here is your answer. [Throws battle axe at messenger's\nfeet.]\n\nMESSENGER. You are stronger than I thought, Thorfinn. For your\ndaughter's sake you shall have a chance to fall like a hero and not as a\nfelon. Make ready for open conflict--out on the field. [Goes out.]\n\nTHORFINN [to Valgerd]. Out on you, cowardly, faithless woman, to guard\nmy treasure so ill! To make my child mine enemy.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. O, my father, am I your enemy?\n\nTHORFINN. You are a Christian; but it is not too late yet. Will you deny\nthe white Christ?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Never! But I will follow you to death.\n\nVALGERD. Thorfinn, you call me cowardly. I can suffer that, but\nfaithless--there you wrong me. I have not loved you as warmly as\nthe southern women are said to love, yet have I been faithful to you\nthroughout life and I have sworn to go with you in death--as is the\nancient custom. [Opens a trap door in floor.] Look, here have I prepared\nmy grave, here would I die under these smoky beams that have witnessed\nmy sorrows--and with those [points to the carved images of Thor and Odin\non uprights of high bench] who guided us here. I want to go with the\nflames, and in the smoke shall my spirit rise to Ginde to receive\ncharity and peace.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. And I to be alone afterward! Oh, let me follow you.\n\nVALGERD. No, child, you are young. You may yet flourish in a milder\nclime. But the old fir tree dies on its roots.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Father, father, you must not die. I will save you!\n\nTHORFINN. You?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Your kinsman Gunnar lies off Hj\u00c3\u00a4rleif's headland with his men.\nSend one of the thralls to him by a roundabout route and he will come.\n\nTHORFINN. So! It wax out of that well that you drew your courage. Keep\nyour help and go if you will.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You shall not think me a coward. I go with you, mother. You\ncannot hinder me.\n\n[Thorfinn goes to the door, trying to conceal his emotion.]\n\nVALGERD. No! Stay, Thorfinn, and for once bare your big soul that I may\nread its dim runics.\n\nTHORFINN. If you cannot interpret them now then may this runic stone\ncrumble to air unread.\n\nVALGERD. You are not the hard stone you would seem. You have feelings.\nShow them. Let them flow forth and you shall know peace!\n\nTHORFINN. My feelings are my heart's blood. Would you see it?\n\n[The clatter of arms is heard outside which continues until Thorfinn\nreturns. Thorfinn starts to go out when he hears the chatter.]\n\nVALGERD. Oh, stay and say a word of farewell!\n\nTHORFINN. Woman, you tear down my strength with your feelings. Let me\ngo! The play has begun!\n\nVALGERD. Say farewell, at least.\n\nTHORNFINN [Restraining his feelings with effort]. Farewell, child. [Goes\nout.]\n\nVALGERD. That man no one will bend.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. God will!\n\nVALGERD. His hardness is great.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. God's mercy is greater!\n\nVALGERD. Farewell, my child.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Do you dare leave me behind, alone?\n\nVALGERD [Embracing Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d]. Are you prepared?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. The holy virgin prays for me.\n\nVALGERD. I trust in the God of love.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. And in the mother of God.\n\nVALGERD. I know her not.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. You must believe in her.\n\nVALGERD. My belief is not your belief.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [Embracing Valgerd]. Forgive me.\n\nVALGERD. Now to your place.\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d opens the wooden shutter at window-hole and looks out. Valgerd\ntakes it torch and places herself by the trap door in floor.]\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. The strife is sharp.\n\nVALGERD. Do you see the Erl?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. He stands at the gate.\n\nVALGERD. How fares he?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Everything falls before him.\n\nVALGERD. Does he weary?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Still is he straight-- -- --See what terrible northern lights.\n\nVALGERD. Have many fallen?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. I cannot tell. They are drawing away from the threshing yard.\nOh, the heavens are red as blood!\n\n[Pause.]\n\nVALGERD. Speak! What do you see?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [With joy]. The silver falcon!\n\nVALGERD. It's an ill-omen.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Father comes.\n\nVALGERD. Is he wounded?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. Oh, now he is falling!\n\nVALGERD. Close the window-hole and trust in God.\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D. No, not yet. A moment.\n\nVALGRED. Are you afraid?\n\nGUNL\u00c3\u0096D [Going toward door]. No! No!\n\n[The sounds of the conflict gradually die away.]\n\nTHORFINN [Comes in pale and wounded.] Stay!\n\n[Valgerd goes towards him. Pause.]\n\nTHORFINN [On high bench]. Come here.\n\n[Valgerd and Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d go to him. Thorfinn caresses Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d's hair, kisses\nher forehead, then presses Valgerd's hand.]\n\nTHORFINN [Kissing Valgerd]. Now you see my heart's blood.\n\n[Valgerd rises to get torch.]\n\nVALGERD. Now is our parting over.\n\nTHORFINN. Stay and live with your child.\n\nVALGERD. My oath!\n\nTHORFINN. My whole life has been a broken oath and yet I hope-- -- --It\nis better to live-- -- --\n\n[Orm comes in wounded. Stops at door.]\n\nORM. May I come?\n\nTHORFINN. Come.\n\nORM. Have you found peace now?\n\nTHORFINN [Caressing the woman]. Soon, soon!\n\nORM. Then we are ready for the journey.\n\nTHORFINN [Looks at Valgerd and Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d]. Not yet.\n\nORM [Sits on bench]. Hurry if you want company.\n\nTHORFINN. Orm, are you a Christian?\n\nORM. You may ask indeed.\n\nTHORFINN. What are you then, riddle?\n\nORM. I was everything. I was nothing. I was a poet.\n\nTHORFINN. Do you believe in anything?\n\nORM. I've come to have a belief.\n\nTHORFINN. What gave it to you?\n\nORM. Doubt, misfortune, sorrow.\n\nTHORFINN [To Valgerd]. Valgerd, give me your hand, so. Hold\nfast--tighter--you must not let go until--the end.\n\n[Gunnar comes in and stops by door.]\n\nTHORFINN. Who comes?\n\nGUNNAR. You know me!\n\nTHORFINN. I know your voice, but my eyes see you not.\n\nGUNNAR. I am your kinsman, Gunnar.\n\nTHORFINN [After a pause]. Step forth.\n\n[Gunnar remains where he is, looking questioningly at Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d.]\n\nTHORFINN. Is he here?\n\n[Gunl\u00c3\u00b6d rises, goes with slow steps and bowed head to Gunnar. Takes his\nhand and leads him to Thorfinn. They kneel.]\n\nTHORFINN [Putting hands on their heads]. Eternal -- -- -- Creating -- --\n-- God--[Dies.]\n\nCURTAIN.\n\n*****\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STRONGER\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n     MME. X., an actress, married\n     MLLE. Y., an actress, unmarried\n     A WAITRESS\n\n\n[SCENE--The corner of a ladies' cafe. Two little iron tables, a red\nvelvet sofa, several chairs. Enter Mme. X., dressed in winter clothes,\ncarrying a Japanese basket on her arm.]\n\n[MLLE. Y. sits with a half empty beer bottle before her, reading an\nillustrated paper, which she changes later for another.]\n\nMME. X. Good afternoon, Amelie. You're sitting here alone on Christmas\neve like a poor bachelor!\n\nMLLE. Y. [Looks up, nods, and resumes her reading.]\n\nMME. X. Do you know it really hurts me to see you like this, alone, in a\ncafe, and on Christmas eve, too. It makes me feel as I did one time when\nI saw a bridal party in a Paris restaurant, and the bride sat reading a\ncomic paper, while the groom played billiards with the witnesses. Huh,\nthought I, with such a beginning, what will follow, and what will be the\nend? He played billiards on his wedding eve! [Mlle. Y. starts to speak].\nAnd she read a comic paper, you mean? Well, they are not altogether the\nsame thing.\n\n[A waitress enters, places a cup of chocolate before Mme. X. and goes\nout.]\n\nMME. X. You know what, Amelie! I believe you would have done better to\nhave kept him! Do you remember, I was the first to say \"Forgive him?\"\nDo you remember that? You would be married now and have a home. Remember\nthat Christmas when you went out to visit your fiance's parents in the\ncountry? How you gloried in the happiness of home life and really longed\nto quit the theatre forever? Yes, Amelie dear, home is the best of all,\nthe theatre next and children--well, you don't understand that.\n\nMLLE. Y. [Looks up scornfully.]\n\n[Mme. X. sips a few spoonfuls out of the cup, then opens her basket and\nshows Christmas presents.]\n\nMME. X. Now you shall see what I bought for my piggywigs. [Takes up a\ndoll.] Look at this! This is for Lisa, ha! Do you see how she can roll\nher eyes and turn her head, eh? And here is Maja's popgun. [Loads it and\nshoots at Mlle. Y.]\n\nMLLE. Y. [Makes a startled gesture.]\n\nMME. X. Did I frighten you? Do you think I would like to shoot you, eh?\nOn my soul, if I don't think you did! If you wanted to shoot _me_ it\nwouldn't be so surprising, because I stood in your way--and I know you\ncan never forget that--although I was absolutely innocent. You still\nbelieve I intrigued and got you out of the Stora theatre, but I didn't.\nI didn't do that, although you think so. Well, it doesn't make any\ndifference what I say to you. You still believe I did it. [Takes up\na pair of embroidered slippers.] And these are for my better half. I\nembroidered them myself--I can't bear tulips, but he wants tulips on\neverything.\n\nMLLE. Y. [Looks up ironically and curiously.]\n\nMME. X. [Putting a hand in each slipper.] What little feet Bob has!\nWhat? And you should see what a splendid stride he has! You've never\nseen him in slippers! [Mlle. Y. laughs aloud.] Look! [She makes the\nslippers walk on the table. Mlle. Y. laughs loudly.] And when he is\ngrumpy he stamps like this with his foot. \"What! damn those servants who\ncan never learn to make coffee. Oh, now those creatures haven't trimmed\nthe lamp wick properly!\" And then there are draughts on the floor and\nhis feet are cold. \"Ugh, how cold it is; the stupid idiots can never\nkeep the fire going.\" [She rubs the slippers together, one sole over the\nother.]\n\nMLLE. Y. [Shrieks with laughter.]\n\nMME. X. And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers which\nMarie has stuck under the chiffonier--oh, but it's sinful to sit here\nand make fun of one's husband this way when he is kind and a good little\nman. You ought to have had such a husband, Amelie. What are you laughing\nat? What? What? And you see he's true to me. Yes, I'm sure of that,\nbecause he told me himself--what are you laughing at?--that when I was\ntouring in Norway that that brazen Fr\u00c3\u00aad\u00c3\u00aarique came and wanted to seduce\nhim! Can you fancy anything so infamous? [Pause.] I'd have torn her eyes\nout if she had come to see him when I was at home. [Pause.] It was lucky\nthat Bob told me about it himself and that it didn't reach me through\ngossip. [Pause.] But would you believe it, Fr\u00c3\u00aad\u00c3\u00aarique wasn't the only\none! I don't know why, but the women are crazy about my husband. They\nmust think he has influence about getting them theatrical engagements,\nbecause he is connected with the government. Perhaps you were after\nhim yourself. I didn't use to trust you any too much. But now I know\nhe never bothered his head about you, and you always seemed to have a\ngrudge against him someway.\n\n[Pause. They look at each other in a puzzled way.]\n\nMME. X. Come and see us this evening, Amelie, and show us that you're\nnot put out with us,--not put out with me at any rate. I don't know, but\nI think it would be uncomfortable to have you for an enemy. Perhaps\nit's because I stood in your way [rallentando] or--I really--don't know\nwhy--in particular.\n\n[Pause. Mlle. Y. stares at Mme. X curiously.]\n\nMME. X [Thoughtfully]. Our acquaintance has been so queer. When I saw\nyou for the first time I was afraid of you, so afraid that I didn't dare\nlet you out of my sight; no matter when or where, I always found myself\nnear you--I didn't dare have you for an enemy, so I became your friend.\nBut there was always discord when you came to our house, because I saw\nthat my husband couldn't endure you, and the whole thing seemed as awry\nto me as an ill-fitting gown--and I did all I could to make him friendly\ntoward you, but with no success until you became engaged. Then came a\nviolent friendship between you, so that it looked all at once as though\nyou both dared show your real feelings only when you were secure--and\nthen--how was it later? I didn't get jealous--strange to say! And I\nremember at the christening, when you acted as godmother, I made him\nkiss you--he did so, and you became so confused--as it were; I didn't\nnotice it then--didn't think about it later, either--have never thought\nabout it until--now! [Rises suddenly.] Why are you silent? You haven't\nsaid a word this whole time, but you have let me go on talking! You have\nsat there, and your eyes have reeled out of me all these thoughts which\nlay like raw silk in its cocoon--thoughts--suspicious thoughts, perhaps.\nLet me see--why did you break your engagement? Why do you never come to\nour house any more? Why won't you come to see us tonight?\n\n[Mlle. Y. appears as if about to speak.]\n\nMME. X. Hush, you needn't speak--I understand it all! It was\nbecause--and because--and because! Yes, yes! Now all the accounts\nbalance. That's it. Fie, I won't sit at the same table with you. [Moves\nher things to another table.] That's the reason I had to embroider\ntulips--which I hate--on his slippers, because you are fond of tulips;\nthat's why [Throws slippers on the floor] we go to Lake M\u00c3\u00a4larn in the\nsummer, because you don't like salt water; that's why my boy is named\nEskil--because it's your father's name; that's why I wear your\ncolors, read your authors, eat your favorite dishes, drink your\ndrinks--chocolate, for instance; that's why--oh--my God--it's terrible,\nwhen I think about it; it's terrible. Everything, everything came from\nyou to me, even your passions. Your soul crept into mine, like a worm\ninto an apple, ate and ate, bored and bored, until nothing was left but\nthe rind and a little black dust within. I wanted to get away from you,\nbut I couldn't; you lay like a snake and charmed me with your black\neyes; I felt that when I lifted my wings they only dragged me down; I\nlay in the water with bound feet, and the stronger I strove to keep up\nthe deeper I worked myself down, down, until I sank to the bottom, where\nyou lay like a giant crab to clutch me in your claws--and there I am\nlying now.\n\nI hate you, hate you, hate you! And you only sit there silent--silent\nand indifferent; indifferent whether it's new moon or waning moon,\nChristmas or New Year's, whether others are happy or unhappy; without\npower to hate or to love; as quiet as a stork by a rat hole--you\ncouldn't scent your prey and capture it, but you could lie in wait for\nit! You sit here in your corner of the caf\u00c3\u00aa--did you know it's called\n\"The Rat Trap\" for you?--and read the papers to see if misfortune hasn't\nbefallen some one, to see if some one hasn't been given notice at the\ntheatre, perhaps; you sit here and calculate about your next victim and\nreckon on your chances of recompense like a pilot in a shipwreck.\nPoor Amelie, I pity you, nevertheless, because I know you are unhappy,\nunhappy like one who has been wounded, and angry because you are\nwounded. I can't be angry with you, no matter how much I want to\nbe--because you come out the weaker one. Yes, all that with Bob doesn't\ntrouble me. What is that to me, after all? And what difference does it\nmake whether I learned to drink chocolate from you or some one else.\n[Sips a spoonful from her cup.]\n\nBesides, chocolate is very healthful. And if you taught me how to\ndress--tant mieux!--that has only made me more attractive to my husband;\nso you lost and I won there. Well, judging by certain signs, I believe\nyou have already lost him; and you certainly intended that I should\nleave him--do as you did with your fianc\u00c3\u00aa and regret as you now regret;\nbut, you see, I don't do that--we mustn't be too exacting. And why\nshould I take only what no one else wants?\n\nPerhaps, take it all in all, I am at this moment the stronger one. You\nreceived nothing from me, but you gave me much. And now I seem like a\nthief since you have awakened and find I possess what is your loss. How\ncould it be otherwise when everything is worthless and sterile in\nyour hands? You can never keep a man's love with your tulips and your\npassions--but I can keep it. You can't learn how to live from your\nauthors, as I have learned. You have no little Eskil to cherish, even\nif your father's name was Eskil. And why are you always silent, silent,\nsilent? I thought that was strength, but perhaps it is because you have\nnothing to say! Because you never think about anything! [Rises and picks\nup slippers.]\n\nNow I'm going home--and take the tulips with me--_your_ tulips! You are\nunable to learn from another; you can't bend--therefore, you broke like\na dry stalk. But I won't break! Thank you, Amelie, for all your good\nlessons. Thanks for teaching my husband how to love. Now I'm going home\nto love him. [Goes.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Plays: The Father; Countess Julie; The\nOutlaw; The Stronger, by August Strindberg\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PLAYS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 8499-8.txt or 8499-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/8\/4\/9\/8499\/\n\nProduced by Nicole Apostola\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":849,"split":"train"}
