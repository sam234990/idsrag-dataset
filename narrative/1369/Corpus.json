A traveler and amateur naturalist, he regains consciousness \"under a heap of earth and stones\" and believes that he had been knocked unconscious in a fall\u00a0\u2013 though his thoughts and recollections are confused. He is astounded to discover that he is entwined in the roots of plants, as though they have been growing around him. Extricating himself and surveying the scene, he sees a great house in the distance, and walks toward it to seek help and information. On his way, he encounters a funeral: a group of strangely yet strikingly dressed people, led by a majestic white-bearded old man, are interring a corpse in a grave. The narrator is especially struck by a beautiful girl who is overcome by grief. She appears to be about 14 years old; though, he soon learns that this world, and everyone in it are far older than they appear. He becomes enchanted by her, and falls in love. The funeral party see him, and express surprise at his presence and his odd uncouth clothes and boots; but they allow him to accompany them to the enormous mansion where they live.\nEnthralled with the girl (her name is Yoletta), and anxious to show his worth in their House, the narrator agrees to work for a year as a probationer in this community. He is constantly stumbling into misunderstandings with his new companions, for the world seems to have changed in so many extreme and incomprehensible ways. The most basic concepts of his society are unknown to these people. When he inquires about the nearest city, the old man who is \"the Father of the House\" thinks he is talking about a beehive. When the narrator notes that they share the English language, he is again not understood; the people of the house think they speak \"the language of human beings\u00a0\u2013 that is all.\" (Though their spoken language has changed little, the writing system is altered so much that the narrator cannot read the \"Hebrew-like characters\" in which their books are written.) It seems that the entire human race is now organized into communal houses like this one, with no other form of social structure, that they know of.\nThe narrator struggles to adapt to this new society, as he pursues Yoletta. He is shocked to learn that all the people are much older than they appear; Yoletta is 31 years old, and the Father of the House is nearly 200. They are vegetarians, and have a strong rapport with the animals in their environment. The narrator is struck by their \"rare physical beauty,\" their \"crystal purity of heart,\" \"ever contented and calmly glad\". Yet he wonders why they have no romantic interests, and why there are no children in the community. He sometimes falls afoul of the strict rules, in which lying is a serious offense, punishable by solitary confinement. Yoletta comes to love him, but like a brother, without the heat of passion he feels for her.\nIn time he meets the mysterious Mother of the House, and begins to comprehend the full strangeness and differentness of their way of life. The humans of this distant future have achieved their utopian state by abandoning sexuality and romantic love. Like a beehive, or a wolf pack, only the Queen, or Alpha Male and Female, or Father and Mother of the House, in this case, reproduce. The rest of the House live communally, as siblings. The narrator despairs when he realizes that his passion for Yoletta can never be consummated; and, wonders whether he can adapt to this mode of living. He does not realize that the Mother has begun the long process of grooming himself and Yoletta to become the new Father and Mother of the House.\nWhen he is in the library, he discovers an elaborately-carved bottle on a shelf; its inscription states that its contents provide a cure for the oppressions of \"time and disease\" and the thoughts or passions that \"lead to madness.\" He takes a dose of the liquid, thinking it will cure his passion for Yoletta, which he doesn't realize she has begun to learn to reciprocate. It is only when his body grows stiff and cold that he realizes that the potion is a poison, and that the only relief from the pains of life it provides is death.\nThis story, of a traveler who falls in love with a mysterious, beautiful young girl with an elderly protector, anticipates the plot of Hudson's later and more famous novel, Green Mansions.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Crystal Age, by W.

H. HUDSON\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n_Romances of the future, however fantastic they may be, have for most\nof us a perennial if mild interest, since they are born of a very common\nfeeling--a sense of dissatisfaction with the existing order of things,\ncombined with a vague faith in or hope of a better one to come. The\npicture put before us is false; we knew it would be false before looking\nat it, since we cannot imagine what is unknown any more than we can\nbuild without materials. Our mental atmosphere surrounds and shuts us in\nlike our own skins; no one can boast that he has broken out of that\nprison. The vast, unbounded prospect lies before us, but, as the poet\nmournfully adds, \"clouds and darkness rest upon it.\" Nevertheless we\ncannot suppress all curiosity, or help asking one another, What is your\ndream--your ideal? What is your News from Nowhere, or, rather, what is\nthe result of the little shake your hand has given to the old pasteboard\ntoy with a dozen bits of colored glass for contents? And, most important\nof all, can you present it in a narrative or romance which will enable\nme to pass an idle hour not disagreeably? How, for instance, does it\ncompare in this respect with other prophetic books on the shelf?_\n\n_I am not referring to living authors; least of all to that flamingo of\nletters who for the last decade or so has been a wonder to our island\nbirds. For what could I say of him that is not known to every one--that\nhe is the tallest of fowls, land or water, of a most singular shape, and\nhas black-tipped crimson wings folded under his delicate rose-colored\nplumage? These other books referred to, written, let us say, from thirty\nor forty years to a century or two ago, amuse us in a way their poor\ndead authors never intended. Most amusing are the dead ones who take\nthemselves seriously, whose books are pulpits quaintly carved and\ndecorated with precious stones and silken canopies in which they stand\nand preach to or at their contemporaries._\n\n_In like manner, in going through this book of mine after so many years I\nam amused at the way it is colored by the little cults and crazes, and\nmodes of thought of the 'eighties of the last century. They were so\nimportant then, and now, if remembered at all, they appear so trivial!\nIt pleases me to be diverted in this way at \"A Crystal Age\"--to find, in\nfact, that I have not stood still while the world has been moving._\n\n_This criticism refers to the case, the habit, of the book rather than\nto its spirit, since when we write we do, as the red man thought, impart\nsomething of our souls to the paper, and it is probable that if I were\nto write a new dream of the future it would, though in some respects\nvery different from this, still be a dream and picture of the human race\nin its forest period._\n\n_Alas that in this case the wish cannot induce belief! For now I remember\nanother thing which Nature said--that earthly excellence can come in no\nway but one, and the ending of passion and strife is the beginning of\ndecay. It is indeed a hard saying, and the hardest lesson we can learn\nof her without losing love and bidding good-by forever to hope._\n\nW. H. H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA CRYSTAL AGE\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nI do not quite know how it happened, my recollection of the whole matter\nebbing in a somewhat clouded condition. I fancy I had gone somewhere on\na botanizing expedition, but whether at home or abroad I don't know. At\nall events, I remember that I had taken up the study of plants with a\ngood deal of enthusiasm, and that while hunting for some variety in the\nmountains I sat down to rest on the edge of a ravine. Perhaps it was on\nthe ledge of an overhanging rock; anyhow, if I remember rightly, the\nground gave way all about me, precipitating me below. The fall was a\nvery considerable one--probably thirty or forty feet, or more, and I was\nrendered unconscious. How long I lay there under the heap of earth and\nstones carried down in my fall it is impossible to say: perhaps a long\ntime; but at last I came to myself and struggled up from the\n_debris_, like a mole coming to the surface of the earth to feel\nthe genial sunshine on his dim eyeballs. I found myself standing (oddly\nenough, on all fours) in an immense pit created by the overthrow of a\ngigantic dead tree with a girth of about thirty or forty feet. The tree\nitself had rolled down to the bottom of the ravine; but the pit in which\nit had left the huge stumps of severed roots was, I found, situated in a\ngentle slope at the top of the bank! How, then, I could have fallen\nseemingly so far from no height at all, puzzled me greatly: it looked as\nif the solid earth had been indulging in some curious transformation\npranks during those moments or minutes of insensibility. Another\nsingular circumstance was that I had a great mass of small fibrous\nrootlets tightly woven about my whole person, so that I was like a\ncolossal basket-worm in its case, or a big man-shaped bottle covered\nwith wicker-work. It appeared as if the roots had _grown_ round me!\nLuckily they were quite sapless and brittle, and without bothering my\nbrains too much about the matter, I set to work to rid myself of them.\nAfter stripping the woody covering off, I found that my tourist suit of\nrough Scotch homespun had not suffered much harm, although the cloth\nexuded a damp, moldy smell; also that my thick-soled climbing boots had\nassumed a cracked rusty appearance as if I had been engaged in some\nbrick-field operations; while my felt hat was in such a discolored and\nbattered condition that I felt almost ashamed to put it on my head. My\nwatch was gone; perhaps I had not been wearing it, but my pocket-book in\nwhich I had my money was safe in my breast pocket.\n\nGlad and grateful at having escaped with unbroken bones from such a\ndangerous accident, I set out walking along the edge of the ravine,\nwhich soon broadened to a valley running between two steep hills; and\nthen, seeing water at the bottom and feeling very dry, I ran down the\nslope to get a drink. Lying flat on my chest to slake my thirst animal\nfashion, I was amazed at the reflection the water gave back of my face:\nit was, skin and hair, thickly encrusted with clay and rootlets! Having\ntaken a long drink, I threw off my clothes to have a bath; and after\nsplashing about for half an hour managed to rid my skin of its\naccumulations of dirt. While drying in the wind I shook the loose sand\nand clay from my garments, then dressed, and, feeling greatly refreshed,\nproceeded on my walk.\n\nFor an hour or so I followed the valley in its many windings, but,\nfailing to see any dwelling-place, I ascended a hill to get a view of\nthe surrounding country. The prospect which disclosed itself when I had\ngot a couple of hundred feet above the surrounding level, appeared\nunfamiliar. The hills among which I had been wandering were now behind\nme; before me spread a wide rolling country, beyond which rose a\nmountain range resembling in the distance blue banked-up clouds with\nsummits and peaks of pearly whiteness. Looking on this scene I could\nhardly refrain from shouting with joy, so glad did the sunlit expanse of\nearth, and the pure exhilarating mountain breeze, make me feel. The\nseason was late summer--that was plain to see; the ground was moist, as\nif from recent showers, and the earth everywhere had that intense living\ngreenness with which it reclothes itself when the greater heats are\nover; but the foliage of the woods was already beginning to be touched\nhere and there with the yellow and russet hues of decay. A more tranquil\nand soul-satisfying scene could not be imagined: the dear old mother\nearth was looking her very best; while the shifting golden sunlight, the\nmysterious haze in the distance, and the glint of a wide stream not very\nfar off, seemed to spiritualize her \"happy autumn fields,\" and bring\nthem into a closer kinship with the blue over-arching sky. There was one\nlarge house or mansion in sight, but no town, nor even a hamlet, and not\none solitary spire. In vain I scanned the horizon, waiting impatiently\nto see the distant puff of white steam from some passing engine. This\ntroubled me not a little, for I had no idea that I had drifted so far\nfrom civilization in my search for specimens, or whatever it was that\nbrought me to this pretty, primitive wilderness. Not quite a wilderness,\nhowever, for there, within a short hour's walk of the hill, stood the\none great stone mansion, close to the river I had mentioned. There were\nalso horses and cows in sight, and a number of scattered sheep were\ngrazing on the hillside beneath me.\n\nStrange to relate, I met with a little misadventure on account of the\nsheep--an animal which one is accustomed to regard as of a timid and\ninoffensive nature. When I set out at a brisk pace to walk to the house\nI have spoken of, in order to make some inquiries there, a few of the\nsheep that happened to be near began to bleat loudly, as if alarmed, and\nby and by they came hurrying after me, apparently in a great state of\nexcitement. I did not mind them much, but presently a pair of horses,\nattracted by their bleatings, also seemed struck at my appearance, and\ncame at a swift gallop to within twenty yards of me. They were\nmagnificent-looking brutes, evidently a pair of well-groomed carriage\nhorses, for their coats, which were of a fine bronze color, sparkled\nwonderfully in the sunshine. In other respects they were very unlike\ncarriage animals, for they had tails reaching to the ground, like\nfuneral horses, and immense black leonine manes, which gave them a\nstrikingly bold and somewhat formidable appearance. For some moments\nthey stood with heads erect, gazing fixedly at me, and then\nsimultaneously delivered a snort of defiance or astonishment, so loud\nand sudden that it startled me like the report of a gun. This tremendous\nequine blast brought yet another enemy on the field in the shape of a\nhuge milk-white bull with long horns: a very noble kind of animal, but\none which I always prefer to admire from behind a hedge, or at a\ndistance through a field-glass. Fortunately his wrathful mutterings gave\nme timely notice of his approach, and without waiting to discover his\nintentions, I incontinently fled down the slope to the refuge of a grove\nor belt of trees clothing the lower portion of the hillside. Spent and\npanting from my run, I embraced a big tree, and turning to face the foe,\nfound that I had not been followed: sheep, horses, and bull were all\ngrouped together just where I had left them, apparently holding a\nconsultation, or comparing notes.\n\nThe trees where I had sought shelter were old, and grew here and there,\nsingly or in scattered groups: it was a pretty wilderness of mingled\ntree, shrub and flower. I was surprised to find here some very large and\nancient-looking fig-trees, and numbers of wasps and flies were busy\nfeeding on a few over-ripe figs on the higher branches. Honey-bees also\nroamed about everywhere, extracting sweets from the autumn bloom, and\nfilling the sunny glades with a soft, monotonous murmur of sound.\nWalking on full of happy thoughts and a keen sense of the sweetness of\nlife pervading me, I presently noticed that a multitude of small birds\nwere gathering about me, flitting through the trees overhead and the\nbushes on either hand, but always keeping near me, apparently as much\nexcited at my presence as if I had been a gigantic owl, or some such\nunnatural monster. Their increasing numbers and incessant excited\nchirping and chattering at first served to amuse, but in the end began\nto irritate me. I observed, too, that the alarm was spreading, and that\nlarger birds, usually shy of men--pigeons, jays, and magpies, I fancied\nthey were--now began to make their appearance. Could it be, thought I\nwith some concern, that I had wandered into some uninhabited wilderness,\nto cause so great a commotion among the little feathered people? I very\nsoon dismissed this as an idle thought, for one does not find houses,\ndomestic animals, and fruit-trees in desert places. No, it was simply\nthe inherent cantankerousness of little birds which caused them to annoy\nme. Looking about on the ground for something to throw at them, I found\nin the grass a freshly-fallen walnut, and, breaking the shell, I quickly\nate the contents. Never had anything tasted so pleasant to me before!\nBut it had a curious effect on me, for, whereas before eating it I had\nnot felt hungry, I now seemed to be famishing, and began excitedly\nsearching about for more nuts. They were lying everywhere in the\ngreatest abundance; for, without knowing it, I had been walking through\na grove composed in large part of old walnut-trees. Nut after nut was\npicked up and eagerly devoured, and I must have eaten four or five dozen\nbefore my ravenous appetite was thoroughly appeased. During this feast I\nhad paid no attention to the birds, but when my hunger was over I began\nagain to feel annoyed at their trivial persecutions, and so continued to\ngather the fallen nuts to throw at them. It amused and piqued me at the\nsame time to see how wide of the mark my missiles went. I could hardly\nhave hit a haystack at a distance of ten yards. After half an hour's\nvigorous practice my right hand began to recover its lost cunning, and I\nwas at last greatly delighted when of my nuts went hissing like a bullet\nthrough the leaves, not further than a yard from the wren, or whatever\nthe little beggar was, I had aimed at. Their Impertinences did not like\nthis at all; they began to find out that I was a rather dangerous person\nto meddle with: their ranks were broken, they became demoralized and\nscattered, in all directions, and I was finally left master of the\nfield.\n\n\"Dolt that I am,\" I suddenly exclaimed, \"to be fooling away my time when\nthe nearest railway station or hotel is perhaps twenty miles away.\"\n\nI hurried on, but when I got to the end of the grove, on the green sward\nnear some laurel and juniper bushes, I came on an excavation apparently\njust made, the loose earth which had been dug out looking quite fresh\nand moist. The hole or foss was narrow, about five feet deep and seven\nfeet long, and looked, I imagined, curiously like a grave. A few yards\naway was a pile of dry brushwood, and some faggots bound together with\nropes of straw, all apparently freshly cut from the neighboring bushes.\nAs I stood there, wondering what these things meant, I happened to\nglance away in the direction of the house where I intended to call,\nwhich was not now visible owing to an intervening grove of tall trees,\nand was surprised to discover a troop of about fifteen persons advancing\nalong the valley in my direction. Before them marched a tall\nwhite-bearded old man; next came eight men, bearing a platform on their\nshoulders with some heavy burden resting upon it; and behind these\nfollowed the others. I began to think that they were actually carrying a\ncorpse, with the intention of giving it burial in that very pit beside\nwhich I was standing; and, although it looked most unlike a funeral, for\nno person in the procession wore black, the thought strengthened to a\nconviction when I became able to distinguish a recumbent, human-like\nform in a shroud-like covering on the platform. It seemed altogether a\nvery unusual proceeding, and made me feel extremely uncomfortable; so\nmuch so that I considered it prudent to step back behind the bushes,\nwhere I could watch the doings of the processionists without being\nobserved.\n\nLed by the old man--who carried, suspended by thin chains, a large\nbronze censer, or brazier rather, which sent out a thin continuous\nwreath of smoke--they came straight on to the pit; and after depositing\ntheir burden on the grass, remained standing for some minutes,\napparently to rest after their walk, all conversing together, but in\nsubdued tones, so that I could not catch their words, although standing\nwithin fifteen yards of the grave. The uncoffined corpse, which seemed\nthat of a full-grown man, was covered with a white cloth, and rested on\na thick straw mat, provided with handles along the sides. On these\nthings, however, I bestowed but a hasty glance, so profoundly absorbed\nhad I become in watching the group of living human beings before me; for\nthey were certainly utterly unlike any fellow-creatures I had ever\nencountered before. The old man was tall and spare, and from his\nsnowy-white majestic beard I took him to be about seventy years old; but\nhe was straight as an arrow, and his free movements and elastic tread\nwere those of a much younger man. His head was adorned with a dark red\nskull-cap, and he wore a robe covering the whole body and reaching to\nthe ankles, of a deep yellow or rhubarb color; but his long wide sleeves\nunder his robe were dark red, embroidered with yellow flowers. The other\nmen had no covering on their heads, and their luxuriant hair, worn to\nthe shoulders, was, in most cases, very dark. Their garments were also\nmade in a different fashion, and consisted of a kilt-like dress, which\ncame half-way to the knees, a pale yellow shirt fitting tight to the\nskin, and over it a loose sleeveless vest. The entire legs were cased in\nstockings, curious in pattern and color. The women wore garments\nresembling those of the men, but the tight-fitting sleeves reached only\nhalf-way to the elbow, the rest of the arm being bare; and the\noutergarment was all in one piece, resembling a long sleeveless jacket,\nreaching below the hips. The color of their dresses varied, but in most\ncases different shades of blue and subdued yellow predominated. In all,\nthe stockings showed deeper and richer shades of color than the other\ngarments; and in their curiously segmented appearance, and in the\nharmonious arrangement of the tints, they seemed to represent the skins\nof pythons and other beautifully variegated serpents. All wore low shoes\nof an orange-brown color, fitting closely so as to display the shape of\nthe foot.\n\nFrom the moment of first seeing them I had had no doubt about the sex of\nthe tall old leader of the procession, his shining white beard being as\nconspicuous at a distance as a shield or a banner; but looking at the\nothers I was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of\nmen or women, or of both, so much did they resemble each other in\nheight, in their smooth faces, and in the length of their hair. On a\ncloser inspection I noticed the difference of dress of the sexes; also\nthat the men, if not sterner, had faces at all events less mild and soft\nin expression than the women, and also a slight perceptible down on the\ncheeks and upper lip.\n\nAfter a first hasty survey of the group in general, I had eyes for only\none person in it--a fine graceful girl about fourteen years old, and the\nyoungest by far of the party. A description of this girl will give some\nidea, albeit a very poor one, of the faces and general appearance of\nthis strange people I had stumbled on. Her dress, if a garment so brief\ncan be called a dress, showed a slaty-blue pattern on a straw-colored\nground, while her stockings were darker shades of the same colors. Her\neyes, at the distance I stood from her, appeared black, or nearly black,\nbut when seen closely they proved to be green--a wonderfully pure,\ntender sea-green; and the others, I found, had eyes of the same hue. Her\nhair fell to her shoulders; but it was very wavy or curly, and strayed\nin small tendril-like tresses over her neck, forehead and cheeks; in\ncolor it was golden black--that is, black in shade, but when touched\nwith sunlight every hair became a thread of shining red-gold; and in\nsome lights it looked like raven-black hair powdered with gold-dust. As\nto her features, the forehead was broader and lower, the nose larger,\nand the lips more slender, than in our most beautiful female types. The\ncolor was also different, the delicately molded mouth being purple-red\ninstead of the approved cherry or coral hue; while the complexion was a\nclear dark, and the color, which mantled the cheeks in moments of\nexcitement, was a dim or dusky rather than a rosy red.\n\nThe exquisite form and face of this young girl, from the first moment of\nseeing her, produced a very deep impression; and I continued watching\nher every movement and gesture with an intense, even a passionate\ninterest. She had a quantity of flowers in her hand; but these sweet\nemblems, I observed, were all gayly colored, which seemed strange, for\nin most places white flowers are used in funeral ceremonies. Some of the\nmen who had followed the body carried in their hands broad,\nthree-cornered bronze shovels, with short black handles, and these they\nhad dropped upon the grass on arriving at the grave. Presently the old\nman stooped and drew the covering back from the dead one's face--a\nrigid, marble-white face set in a loose mass of black hair. The others\ngathered round, and some standing, others kneeling, bent on the still\ncountenance before them a long earnest gaze, as if taking an eternal\nfarewell of one they had deeply loved. At this moment the the beautiful\ngirl I have described all at once threw herself with a sobbing cry on\nher knees before the corpse, and, stooping, kissed the face with\npassionate grief. \"Oh, my beloved, must we now leave you alone forever!\"\nshe cried between the sobs that shook her whole frame. \"Oh, my love--my\nlove--my love, will you come back to us no more!\"\n\nThe others all appeared deeply affected at her grief, and presently a\nyoung man standing by raised her from the ground and drew her gently\nagainst his side, where for some minutes she continued convulsively\nweeping. Some of the other men now passed ropes through the handles of\nthe straw mat on which the corpse rested, and raising it from the\nplatform lowered it into the foss. Each person in turn then advanced and\ndropped some flowers into the grave, uttering the one word \"Farewell\" as\nthey did so; after which the loose earth was shoveled in with the bronze\nimplements. Over the mound the hurdle on which the straw mat had rested\nwas then placed, the dry brushwood and faggots heaped over it and\nignited with a coal from the brazier. White smoke and crackling flames\nissued anon from the pile, and in a few moments the whole was in a\nfierce blaze.\n\nStanding around they all waited in silence until the fire had burnt\nitself out; then the old man advancing stretched his arms above the\nwhite and still smoking ashes and cried in a loud voice: \"Farewell\nforever, O well beloved son! With deep sorrow and tears we have given\nyou back to Earth; but not until she has made the sweet grass and\nflowers grow again on this spot, scorched and made desolate with fire,\nshall our hearts be healed of their wound and forget their grief.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe thrilling, pathetic tone in which these words were uttered affected\nme not a little; and when the ceremony was over I continued staring\nvacantly at the speaker, ignorant of the fact that the beautiful young\ngirl had her wide-open, startled eyes fixed on the bush which, I vainly\nimagined, concealed me from view.\n\nAll at once she cried out: \"Oh, father, look there! Who is that\nstrange-looking man watching us from behind the bushes?\"\n\nThey all turned, and then I felt that fourteen or fifteen pairs of very\nkeen eyes were on me, seeing me very plainly indeed, for in my curiosity\nand excitement I had come out from the thicker bushes to place myself\nbehind a ragged, almost leafless shrub, which afforded the merest\napology for a shelter. Putting a bold face on the matter, although I did\nnot feel very easy, I came out and advanced to them, removing my\nbattered old hat on the way, and bowing repeatedly to the assembled\ncompany. My courteous salutation was not returned; but all, with\nincreasing astonishment pictured on their faces, continued staring at me\nas if they were looking on some grotesque apparition. Thinking it best\nto give an account of myself at once, and to apologize for intruding on\ntheir mysteries, I addressed myself to the old man:\n\n\"I really beg your pardon,\" I said, \"for having disturbed you at such an\ninconvenient time, and while you are engaged in these--these solemn\nrites; but I assure you, sir, it has been quite accidental. I happened\nto be walking here when I saw you coming, and thought it best to step\nout of the way until--well, until the funeral was over. The fact is, I\nmet with a serious accident in the mountains over there. I fell down\ninto a ravine, and a great heap of earth and stones fell on and stunned\nme, and I do not know how long I lay there before I recovered my senses.\nI daresay I am trespassing, but I am a perfect stranger here, and quite\nlost, and--and perhaps a little confused after my fall, and perhaps you\nwill kindly tell me where to go to get some refreshment, and find out\nwhere I am.\"\n\n\"Your story is a very strange one,\" said the old man in reply, after a\npause of considerable duration. \"That you are a perfect stranger in this\nplace is evident from your appearance, your uncouth dress, and your\nthick speech.\"\n\nHis words made me blush hotly, although I should not have minded his\nvery personal remarks much if that beautiful girl had not been standing\nthere listening to everything. My _uncouth_ garments, by the way,\nwere made by a fashionable West End tailor, and fitted me perfectly,\nalthough just now they were, of course, very dirty. It was also a\nsurprise to hear that I had a _thick speech_, since I had always\nbeen considered a remarkably clear speaker and good singer, and had\nfrequently both sung and recited in public, at amateur entertainments.\n\nAfter a distressing interval of silence, during which they all continued\nregarding me with unabated curiosity, the old gentleman condescended to\naddress me again and asked me my name and country.\n\n\"My country,\" said I, with the natural pride of a Briton, \"is England,\nand my name is Smith.\"\n\n\"No such country is known to me,\" he returned; \"nor have I ever heard\nsuch a name as yours.\"\n\nI was rather taken aback at his words, and yet did not just then by any\nmeans realize their full import. I was thinking only about my name; for\nwithout having penetrated into any perfectly savage country, I had been\nabout the world a great deal for a young man, visiting the Colonies,\nIndia, Yokohama, and other distant places, and I had never yet been told\nthat the name of Smith was an unfamiliar one.\n\n\"I hardly know what to say,\" I returned, for he was evidently waiting\nfor me to add something more to what I had stated. \"It rather staggers\nme to hear that my name-well, you have not heard of _me_, of\ncourse, but there have been a great many distinguished men of the same\nname: Sydney Smith, for instance, and--and several others.\" It mortified\nme just then to find that I had forgotten all the other distinguished\nSmiths.\n\nHe shook his head, and continued watching my face.\n\n\"Not heard of them!\" I exclaimed. \"Well, I suppose you have heard of\nsome of my great countrymen: Beaconsfield, Gladstone, Darwin,\nBurne-Jones, Ruskin, Queen Victoria, Tennyson, George Eliot, Herbert\nSpencer, General Gordon, Lord Randolph Churchill--\"\n\nAs he continued to shake his head after each name I at length paused.\n\n\"Who are all these people you have named?\" he asked.\n\n\"They are all great and illustrious men and women who have a world-wide\nreputation,\" I answered.\n\n\"And are there no more of them--have you told me the names of _all_\nthe great people you have ever known or heard of?\" he said, with a\ncurious smile.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" I answered, nettled at his words and manner. \"It would\ntake me until to-morrow to name _all_ the great men I have ever\nheard of. I suppose you have heard the names of Napoleon, Wellington,\nNelson, Dante, Luther, Calvin, Bismarck, Voltaire?\"\n\nHe still shook his head.\n\n\"Well, then,\" I continued, \"Homer, Socrates, Alexander the Great,\nConfucius, Zoroaster, Plato, Shakespeare.\" Then, growing thoroughly\ndesperate, I added in a burst: \"Noah, Moses, Columbus, Hannibal, Adam\nand Eve!\"\n\n\"I am quite sure that I have never heard of any of these names,\" he\nanswered, still with that curious smile. \"Nevertheless I can understand\nyour surprise. It sometimes happens that the mind, owing an an imperfect\nadjustment of its faculties, resembles the uneducated vision in its\nmethod of judgment, regarding the things which are near as great and\nimportant, and those further away as less important, according to their\ndistance. In such a case the individuals one hears about or associates\nwith, come to be looked upon as the great and illustrious beings of the\nworld, and all men in all places are expected to be familiar with their\nnames. But come, my children, our sorrowful task is over, let us now\nreturn to the house. Come with us, Smith, and you shall have the\nrefreshment you require.\"\n\nI was, of course, pleased with the invitation, but did not relish being\naddressed as \"Smith,\" like some mere laborer or other common person\ntramping about the country.\n\nThe long disconcerting scrutiny I had been subjected to had naturally\nmade me very uncomfortable, and caused me to drop a little behind the\nothers as we walked towards the house. The old man, however, still kept\nat my side; but whether from motives of courtesy, or because he wished\nto badger me a little more about my uncouth appearance and defective\nintellect, I was not sure. I was not anxious to continue the\nconversation, which had not proved very satisfactory; moreover, the\nbeautiful girl I have already mentioned so frequently, was now walking\njust before me, hand in hand with the young man who had raised her from\nthe ground. I was absorbed in admiration of her graceful figure,\nand--shall I be forgiven for mentioning such a detail?--her exquisitely\nrounded legs under her brief and beautiful garments. To my mind the\ngarment was quite long enough. Every time I spoke, for my companion\nstill maintained the conversation and I was obliged to reply, she hung\nback a little to catch my words. At such times she would also turn her\npretty head partially round so as to see me: then her glances, beginning\nat my face, would wander down to my legs, and her lips would twitch and\ncurl a little, seeming to express disgust and amusement at the same\ntime. I was beginning to hate my legs, or rather my trousers, for I\nconsidered that under them I had as good a pair of calves as any man in\nthe company.\n\nPresently I thought of something to say, something very simple, which my\ndignified old friend would be able to answer without intimating that he\nconsidered me a wild man of the woods or an escaped lunatic.\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" I said pleasantly, \"what is the name of your nearest\ntown or city? how far it is from this place, and how I can get there?\"\n\nAt this question, or series of questions, the young girl turned quite\nround, and, waiting until I was even with her, she continued her walk at\nmy side, although still holding her companion's hand.\n\nThe old man looked at me with a grave smile--that smile was fast\nbecoming intolerable--and said: \"Are you so fond of honey, Smith? You\nshall have as much as you require without disturbing the bees. They are\nnow taking advantage of this second spring to lay by a sufficient\nprovision before winter sets in.\"\n\nAfter pondering some time over these enigmatical words, I said: \"I\ndaresay we are at cross purposes again. I mean,\" I added hurriedly,\nseeing the inquiring look on his face, \"that we do not exactly\nunderstand each other, for the subject of honey was not in my thoughts.\"\n\n\"What, then, do you mean by a city?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do I mean? Why, a city, I take it, is nothing more than a\ncollection or congeries of houses--hundreds and thousands, or hundreds\n_of_ thousands of houses, all built close together, where one can\nlive very comfortably for years without seeing a blade of grass.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he returned, \"that the accident you met with in the\nmountains must have caused some injury to your brain; for I cannot in\nany other way account for these strange fantasies.\"\n\n\"Do you mean seriously to tell me, sir, that you have never even heard\nof the existence of a city, where millions of human beings live crowded\ntogether in a small space? Of course I mean a small space comparatively;\nfor in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the\nfields; and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large\nthat a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of\nit.\"\n\nIt struck me the moment I finished speaking that this comparison was not\nquite right somehow; but he did not ask me to explain: he had evidently\nceased to pay any attention to what I said. The girl looked at me with\nan expression of pity, not to say contempt, and I felt at the same time\nashamed and vexed. This served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me,\nand I returned to the subject once more.\n\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"you have heard of such cities as Paris, Vienna, Rome,\nAthens, Babylon, Jerusalem?\"\n\nHe only shook his head, and walked on in silence.\n\n\"And London! London is the capital of England. Why,\" I exclaimed,\nbeginning to see light, and wondering at myself for not having seen it\nsooner, \"you are at present talking to me in the English language.\"\n\n\"I fail to understand your meaning, and am even inclined to doubt that\nyou have any,\" said he, a little ruffled. \"I am addressing you in the\nlanguage of human beings--that is all.\"\n\n\"Well, it seems awfully puzzling,\" said I; \"but I hope you don't think I\nhave been indulging in--well, tarradiddles.\" Then, seeing that I was\nmaking matters no clearer, I added: \"I mean that I have not been telling\nuntruths.\"\n\n\"I could not think that,\" he answered sternly. \"It would indeed be a\nclouded mind which could mistake mere disordered fancies for willful\noffenses against the truth. I have no doubt that when you have recovered\nfrom the effects of your late accident these vain thoughts and\nimaginations will cease to trouble you.\"\n\n\"And in the meantime, perhaps, I had better say as little as possible,\"\nsaid I, with considerable temper. \"At present we do not seem able to\nunderstand each other at all.\"\n\n\"You are right, we do not,\" he said; and then added with a grave smile,\n\"although I must allow that this last remark of yours is quite\nintelligible.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that,\" I returned. \"It is distressing to talk and not to be\nunderstood; it is like men calling to each other in a high wind, hearing\nvoices but not able to distinguish words.\"\n\n\"Again I understand you,\" said he approvingly; while the beautiful girl\nbestowed on me the coveted reward of a smile, which had no pity or\ncontempt in it.\n\n\"I think,\" I continued, determined to follow up this new train of ideas\non which I had so luckily stumbled, \"that we are not so far apart in\nmind after all. About some things we stand quite away from each other,\nlike the widely diverging branches of a tree; but, like the branches, we\nhave a meeting-place, and this is, I fancy, in that part of our nature\nwhere our feelings are. My accident in the hills has not disarranged\nthat part of me, I am sure, and I can give you an instance. A little\nwhile ago when I was standing behind the bushes watching you all, I saw\nthis young lady----\"\n\nHere a look of surprise and inquiry from the girl warned me that I was\nonce more plunging into obscurity.\n\n\"When I saw _you_,\" I continued, somewhat amused at her manner,\n\"cast yourself on the earth to kiss the cold face of one you had loved\nin life, I felt the tears of sympathy come to my own eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh, how strange!\" she exclaimed, flashing on me a glance from her\ngreen, mysterious eyes; and then, to increase my wonder and delight, she\ndeliberately placed her hand in mine.\n\n\"And yet not strange,\" said the old man, by way of comment on her words.\n\n\"It seemed strange to Yoletta that one so unlike us outwardly should be\nso like us in heart,\" remarked the young man at her side.\n\nThere was something about this speech which I did not altogether like,\nthough I could not detect anything like sarcasm in the tone of the\nspeaker.\n\n\"And yet,\" continued the lovely girl, \"you never saw him living--never\nheard his sweet voice, which still seems to come back to me like a\nmelody from the distance.\"\n\n\"Was he your father?\" I asked.\n\nThe question seemed to surprise her very much. \"_He_ is our\nfather,\" she returned, with a glance at the old gentleman, which seemed\nstrange, for he certainly looked aged enough to be her great-grandfather.\n\nHe smiled and said: \"You forget, my daughter, that I am as little known\nto this stranger to our country as all the great and illustrious\npersonages he has mentioned are to us.\"\n\nAt this point I began to lose interest in the conversation. It was\nenough for me to feel that I held that precious hand in mine, and\npresently I felt tempted to administer a gentle squeeze. She looked at\nme and smiled, then glanced over my whole person, the survey finishing\nat my boots, which seemed to have a disagreeable fascination for her.\nShe shivered slightly, and withdrew her hand from mine, and in my heart\nI cursed those rusty, thick-soled monstrosities in which my feet were\ncased. However, we were all on a better footing now; and I resolved for\nthe future to avoid all dangerous topics, historical and geographical,\nand confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our\nnatures.\n\nAt the end our way to the house was over a green turf, among great trees\nas in a park; and as there was no road or path, the first sight of the\nbuilding seen near, when we emerged from the trees, came as a surprise.\nThere were no gardens, lawns, inclosures or hedges near it, nor\ncultivation of any kind. It was like a wilderness, and the house\nproduced the effect of a noble ruin. It was a hilly stone country where\nmasses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the\ngreen slopes, and it appeared that the house had been raised on the\nnatural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the\nriver that flowed behind it. The stone was gray, tinged with red, and\nthe whole rock, covering an acre or so of ground, had been worn or hewn\ndown to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the\nsurrounding green level. The sloping and buttressed sides of the\nplatform were clothed with ivy, wild shrubs, and various flowering\nplants. Broad, shallow steps led up to the house, which was all of the\nsame material--reddish-gray stone; and the main entrance was beneath a\nlofty portico, the sculptured entablature of which was supported by\nsixteen huge caryatides, standing on round massive pedestals. The\nbuilding was not high as a castle or cathedral; it was a dwelling-place,\nand had but one floor, and resembled a ruin to my eyes because of the\nextreme antiquity of its appearance, the weather-worn condition and\nmassiveness of the sculptured surfaces, and the masses of ancient ivy\ncovering it in places. On the central portion of the building rested a\ngreat dome-shaped roof, resembling ground glass of a pale reddish tint,\nproducing the effect of a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill.\n\nI remained standing on the grass about thirty yards from the first steps\nafter the others had gone in, all but the old gentleman, who still kept\nwith me. By-and-by, withdrawing to a stone bench under an oak-tree, he\nmotioned to me to take a seat by his side. He said nothing, but appeared\nto be quietly enjoying my undisguised surprise and admiration.\n\n\"A noble mansion!\" I remarked at length to my venerable host, feeling,\nEnglishman-like, a sudden great access of respect towards the owner of a\nbig house. Men in such a position can afford to be as eccentric as they\nlike, even to the wearing of Carnivalesque garments, burying their\nfriends or relations in a park, and shaking their heads over such names\nas Smith or Shakespeare. \"A glorious place! It must have cost a pot of\nmoney, and taken a long time to build.\"\n\n\"What you mean by _a pot of money_ I do not know,\" said he. \"When\nyou add _a long time to build_, I am also puzzled to understand\nyou. For are not all houses, like the forest of trees, the human race,\nthe world we live in, eternal?\"\n\n\"If they stand forever they are so in one sense, I suppose,\" I answered,\nbeginning to fear that I had already unfortunately broken the rule I had\nso recently laid down for my own guidance. \"But the trees of the forest,\nto which you compare a house, spring from seed, do they not? and so have\na beginning. Their end also, like the end of man, is to die and return\nto the dust.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" he returned; \"it is, moreover, a truth which I do not\nnow hear for the first time; but it has no connection with the subject\nwe are discussing. Men pass away, and others take their places. Trees\nalso decay, but the forest does not die, or suffer for the loss of\nindividual trees; is it not the same with the house and the family\ninhabiting it, which is one with the house, and endures forever, albeit\nthe members composing it must all in time return to the dust?\"\n\n\"Is there no decay, then, of the materials composing a house?\"\n\n\"Assuredly there is! Even the hardest stone is worn in time by the\nelements, or by the footsteps of many generations of men; but the stone\nthat decays is removed, and the house does not suffer.\"\n\n\"I have never looked at it quite in this light before,\" said I. \"But\nsurely we can build a house whenever we wish!\"\n\n\"Build a house whenever we wish!\" he repeated, with that astonished look\nwhich threatened to become the permanent expression of his face--so long\nas he had me to talk with, at any rate.\n\n\"Yes, or pull one down if we find it unsuitable--\" But his look of\nhorror here made me pause, and to finish the sentence I added: \"Of\ncourse, you must admit that a house had a beginning?\"\n\n\"Yes; and so had the forest, the mountain, the human race, the world\nitself. But the origin of all these things is covered with the mists of\ntime.\"\n\n\"Does it never happen, then, that a house, however substantially\nbuilt--\"\n\n\"However what! But never mind; you continue to speak in riddles. Pray,\nfinish what you were saying.\"\n\n\"Does it never happen that a house is overthrown by some natural\nforce--by floods, or subsidence of the earth, or is destroyed by\nlightning or fire?\"\n\n\"No!\" he answered, with such tremendous emphasis that he almost made me\njump from my seat. \"Are you alone so ignorant of these things that you\nspeak of building and of pulling down a house?\"\n\n\"Well, I fancied I knew a lot of things once,\" I answered, with a sigh.\n\"But perhaps I was mistaken--people often are. I should like to hear you\nsay something more about all these things--I mean about the house and\nthe family, and the rest of it.\"\n\n\"Are you not, then, able to read--have you been taught absolutely\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly I can read,\" I answered, joyfully seizing at once on\nthe suggestion, which seemed to open a simple, pleasant way of escape\nfrom the difficulty. \"I am by no means a studious person; perhaps I am\nnever so happy as when I have nothing to read. Nevertheless, I do\noccasionally look into books, and greatly appreciate their gentle,\nkindly ways. They never shut themselves up with a sound like a slap, or\nthrow themselves at your head for a duffer, but seem silently grateful\nfor being read, even by a stupid person, and teach you very patiently,\nlike a pretty, meek-spirited young girl.\"\n\n\"I am very pleased to hear it,\" said he. \"You shall read and learn all\nthese things for yourself, which is the best method. Or perhaps I ought\nrather to say, you shall by reading recall them to your mind, for it is\nimpossible to believe that it has always been in its present pitiable\ncondition. I can only attribute such a mental state, with its disordered\nfancies about cities, or immense hives of human beings, and other things\nequally frightful to contemplate, and its absolute vacancy concerning\nordinary matters of knowledge, to the grave accident you met with in the\nhills. Doubtless in falling your head was struck and injured by a stone.\nLet us hope that you will soon recover possession of your memory and\nother faculties. And now let us repair to the eating-room, for it is\nbest to refresh the body first, and the mind afterwards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nWe ascended the steps, and passing through the portico went into the\nhall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I\ndiscovered later; the doors, of which there were several, some of\ncolored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back\ninto receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet\nthick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and\nbronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and\nseveral tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors\nwere covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone\ncombined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably\nrich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite\npattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. Though beautiful,\nit was somewhat somber, as the light was not strong. At all events, that\nis how it struck me at first on coming in from the bright sunlight. Nor,\nit appeared, was I alone in experiencing such a feeling. As soon as we\nwere inside, the old gentleman, removing his cap and passing his thin\nfingers through his white hair, looked around him, and addressing some\nof the others, who were bringing in small round tables and placing them\nabout the hall, said: \"No, no; let us sup this evening where we can look\nat the sky.\"\n\nThe tables were immediately taken away.\n\nNow some of those who were in the hall or who came in with the tables\nhad not attended the funeral, and these were all astonished on seeing\nme. They did not stare at me, but I, of course, saw the expression on\ntheir faces, and noticed that the others who had made my acquaintance at\nthe grave-side whispered in their ears to explain my presence. This made\nme extremely uncomfortable, and it was a relief when they began to go\nout again.\n\nOne of the men was seated near me; he was of those who had assisted in\ncarrying the corpse, and he now turned to me and remarked: \"You have\nbeen a long time in the open air, and probably feel the change as much\nas we do.\"\n\nI assented, and he rose and walked away to the far end of the hall,\nwhere a great door stood facing the one by which we had entered. From\nthe spot where I was--a distance of forty or fifty feet, perhaps--this\ndoor appeared to be of polished slate of a very dark gray, its surface\nornamented with very large horse-chestnut leaves of brass or copper, or\nboth, for they varied in shade from bright yellow to deepest copper-red.\nIt was a double door with agate handles, and, first pressing on one\nhandle, then on the other, he thrust it back into the walls on either\nside, revealing a new thing of beauty to my eyes, for behind the\nvanished door was a window, the sight of which came suddenly before me\nlike a celestial vision. Sunshine, wind, cloud and rain had evidently\ninspired the artist who designed it, but I did not at the time\nunderstand the meaning of the symbolic figures appearing in the picture.\nBelow, with loosened dark golden-red hair and amber-colored garments\nfluttering in the wind, stood a graceful female figure on the summit of\na gray rock; over the rock, and as high as her knees, slanted the thin\nbranches of some mountain shrub, the strong wind even now stripping them\nof their remaining yellow and russet leaves, whirling them aloft and\naway. Round the woman's head was a garland of ivy leaves, and she was\ngazing aloft with expectant face, stretching up her arms, as if to\nimplore or receive some precious gift from the sky. Above, against the\nslaty-gray cloud-wrack, four exquisite slender girl-forms appeared, with\nloose hair, silver-gray drapery and gauzy wings as of ephemerae, flying\nin pursuit of the cloud. Each carried a quantity of flowers, shaped like\nlilies, in her dress, held up with the left hand; one carried red\nlilies, another yellow, the third violet, and the last blue; and the\ngauzy wings and drapery of each was also touched in places with the same\nhue as the flowers she carried. Looking back in their flight they were\nall with the disengaged hand throwing down lilies to the standing\nfigure.\n\nThis lovely window gave a fresh charm to the whole apartment, while the\nsunlight falling through it served also to reveal other beauties which I\nhad not observed. One that quickly drew and absorbed my attention was a\npiece of statuary on the floor at some distance from me, and going to it\nI stood for some time gazing on it in the greatest delight. It was a\nstatue about one-third the size of life, of a young woman seated on a\nwhite bull with golden horns. She had a graceful figure and beautiful\ncountenance; the face, arms and feet were alabaster, the flesh tinted,\nbut with colors more delicate than in nature. On her arms were broad\ngolden armlets, and the drapery, a long flowing robe, was blue,\nembroidered with yellow flowers. A stringed instrument rested on her\nknee, and she was represented playing and singing. The bull, with\nlowered horns, appeared walking; about his chest hung a garland of\nflowers mingled with ears of yellow corn, oak, ivy, and various other\nleaves, green and russet, and acorns and crimson berries. The garland\nand blue dress were made of malachite, _lapis lazuli_, and various\nprecious stones.\n\n\"Aha, my fair Phoenician, I know you well!\" thought I exultingly,\n\"though I never saw you before with a harp in your hand. But were you\nnot gathering flowers, O lovely daughter of Agenor, when that celestial\nanimal, that masquerading god, put himself so cunningly in your way to\nbe admired and caressed, until you unsuspiciously placed yourself on his\nback? That explains the garland. I shall have a word to say about this\npretty thing to my learned and very superior host.\"\n\nThe statue stood on an octagonal pedestal of a highly polished\nslaty-gray stone, and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which\none human figure appeared. Now, from gazing on the statue itself I fell\nto contemplating one of these pictures with a very keen interest, for\nthe figure, I recognized, was a portrait of the beautiful girl Yoletta.\nThe picture was a winter landscape. The earth was white, not with snow,\nbut with hoar frost; the distant trees, clothed by the frozen moisture\nas if with a feathery foliage, looked misty against the whitey-blue\nwintry sky. In the foreground, on the pale frosted grass, stood the\ngirl, in a dark maroon dress, with silver embroidery on the bosom, and a\ndark red cap on her head. Close to her drooped the slender terminal\ntwigs of a tree, sparkling with rime and icicle, and on the twigs were\nseveral small snow-white birds, hopping and fluttering down towards her\noutstretched hand; while she gazed up at them with flushed cheeks, and\nlips parting with a bright, joyous smile.\n\nPresently, while I stood admiring this most lovely work, the young man I\nhave mentioned as having raised Yoletta from the ground at the grave\ncame to my side and remarked, smiling: \"You have noticed the\nresemblance.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I returned; \"she is painted to the life.\"\n\n\"This is not Yoletta's portrait,\" he replied, \"though it is very like\nher;\" and then, when I looked at him incredulously, he pointed to some\nletters under the picture, saying: \"Do you not see the name and date?\"\n\nFinding that I could not read the words, I hazarded the remark that it\nwas Yoletta's mother, perhaps.\n\n\"This portrait was painted four centuries ago,\" he said, with surprise\nin his accent; and then he turned aside, thinking me, perhaps, a rather\ndull and ignorant person.\n\nI did not want him to go away with that impression, and remarked,\npointing to the statue I have spoken of: \"I fancy I know very well who\nthat is--that is Europa.\"\n\n\"Europa? That is a name I never heard; I doubt that any one in the house\never bore it.\" Then, with a half-puzzled smile, he added: \"How could you\npossibly know unless you were told? No, that is Mistrelde. It was\nformerly the custom of the house for the Mother to ride on a white bull\nat the harvest festival. Mistrelde was the last to observe it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" I returned lamely, though I didn't see at all. The\nindifferent way in which he spoke of _centuries_ in connection with\nthis brilliant and apparently fresh-painted picture rather took me\naback.\n\nPresently he condescended to say something more. Pointing to the marks\nor characters which I could not read, he said: \"You have seen the name\nof Yoletta here, and that and the resemblance misled you. You must know\nthat there has always been a Yoletta in this house. This was the\ndaughter of Mistrelde, the Mother, who died young and left but eight\nchildren; and when this work was made their portraits were placed on the\neight faces of the pedestal.\"\n\n\"Thanks for telling me,\" I said, wondering if it was all true, or only a\nfantastic romance.\n\nHe then motioned me to follow him, and we quitted that room where it had\nbeen decided that we were not to sup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nWe came to a large portico-like place open on three sides to the air,\nthe roof being supported by slender columns. We were now on the opposite\nside of the house and looked upon the river, which was not more than a\ncouple of hundred yards from the terrace or platform on which it stood.\nThe ground here sloped rapidly to the banks, and, like that in the\nfront, was a wilderness with rock and patches of tall fern and thickets\nof thorn and bramble, with a few trees of great size. Nor was wild life\nwanting in this natural park; some deer were feeding near the bank,\nwhile on the water numbers of wild duck and other water-fowl were\ndisporting themselves, splashing and flapping over the surface and\nuttering shrill cries.\n\nThe people of the house were already assembled, standing and sitting by\nthe small tables. There was a lively hum of conversation, which ceased\non my entrance; then those who were sitting stood up and the whole\ncompany fixed its eyes on me, which was rather disconcerting.\n\nThe old gentleman, standing in the midst of the people, now bent on me a\nlong, scrutinizing gaze; he appeared to be waiting for me to speak, and,\nfinding that I remained silent, he finally addressed me with solemnity.\n\"Smith,\" he said--and I did not like it--\"the meeting with you today was\nto me and to all of us a very strange experience: I little thought that\nan even stranger one awaited me, that before you break bread in this\nhouse in which you have found shelter, I should have to remind you that\nyou are now in a house.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know I am,\" I said, and then added: \"I'm sure, sir, I appreciate\nyour kindness in bringing me here.\"\n\nHe had perhaps expected something more or something entirely different\nfrom me, as he continued standing with his eyes fixed on me. Then with a\nsigh, and looking round him, he said in a dissatisfied tone: \"My\nchildren, let us begin, and for the present put out of our minds this\nmatter which has been troubling us.\"\n\nHe then motioned me to a seat at his own table, where I was pleased to\nhave a place since the lovely Yoletta was also there.\n\nI am not particular about what I eat, as with me good digestion waits on\nappetite, and so long as I get a bellyful--to use a good old English\nword--I am satisfied. On this particular occasion, with or without a\npretty girl at the table, I could have consumed a haggis--that greatest\nabomination ever invented by flesh-eating barbarians--I was so\ndesperately hungry. It was therefore a disappointment when nothing more\nsubstantial than a plate of whitey-green, crisp-looking stuff resembling\nendive, was placed before me by one of the picturesque handmaidens. It\nwas cold and somewhat bitter to the taste, but hunger compelled me to\neat it even to the last green leaf; then, when I began to wonder if it\nwould be right to ask for more, to my great relief other more succulent\ndishes followed, composed of various vegetables. We also had some\npleasant drinks, made, I suppose, from the juices of fruits, but the\ndelicious alcoholic sting was not in them. We had fruits, too, of\nunfamiliar flavors, and a confection of crushed nuts and honey.\n\nWe sat at table--or tables--a long time, and the meal was enlivened with\nconversation; for all now appeared in a cheerful frame of mind,\nnotwithstanding the melancholy event which had occupied them during the\nday. It was, in fact, a kind of supper, and the one great meal of the\nday: the only other meals being a breakfast, and at noon a crust of\nbrown bread, a handful of dried fruit, and drink of milk.\n\nAt the conclusion of the repast, during which I had been too much\noccupied to take notice of everything that passed, I observed that a\nnumber of small birds had flown in, and were briskly hopping over the\nfloor and tables, also perching quite fearlessly on the heads or\nshoulders of the company, and that they were being fed with the\nfragments. I took them to be sparrows and things of that kind, but they\ndid not look altogether familiar to me. One little fellow, most lively\nin his motions, was remarkably like my old friend the robin, only the\nbosom was more vivid, running almost into orange, and the wings and tail\nwere tipped with the same hue, giving it quite a distinguished\nappearance. Another small olive-green bird, which I at first took for a\ngreen linnet, was even prettier, the throat and bosom being of a most\ndelicate buff, crossed with a belt of velvet black. The bird that really\nseemed most like a common sparrow was chestnut, with a white throat and\nmouse-colored wings and tail. These pretty little pensioners\nsystematically avoided my neighborhood, although I tempted them with\ncrumbs and fruit; only one flew onto my table, but had no sooner done so\nthan it darted away again, and out of the room, as if greatly alarmed. I\ncaught the pretty girl's eye just then, and having finished eating, and\nbeing anxious to join the conversation, for I hate to sit silent when\nothers are talking. I remarked that it was strange the little birds so\npersistently avoided me.\n\n\"Oh no, not at all strange,\" she replied, with surprising readiness,\nshowing that she too had noticed it. \"They are frightened at your\nappearance.\"\n\n\"I must indeed appear strange to them,\" said I, with some bitterness,\nand recalling the adventures of the morning. \"It is to me a new and very\npainful experience to walk about the world frightening men, cattle, and\nbirds; yet I suppose it is entirely due to the clothes I am wearing--and\nthe boots. I wish some kind person would suggest a remedy for this state\nof things; for just now my greatest desire is to be dressed in\naccordance with the fashion.\"\n\n\"Allow me to interrupt you for one moment, Smith,\" said the old\ngentleman, who had been listening attentively to my words. \"We\nunderstood what you said so well on this occasion that it seems a pity\nyou should suddenly again render yourself unintelligible. Can you\nexplain to us what you mean by dressing in accordance with the fashion?\"\n\n\"My meaning is, that I simply desire to dress like one of yourselves, to\nsee the last of these _uncouth_ garments.\" I could not help putting\na little vicious emphasis on that hateful word.\n\nHe inclined his head and said, \"Yes?\"\n\nThus encouraged, I dashed boldly into the middle of matter; for now,\nhaving dined, albeit without wine, I was inflamed with an intense\ncraving to see myself arrayed in their rich, mysterious dress. \"This\nbeing so,\" I continued, \"may I ask you if it is in your power to provide\nme with the necessary garments, so that I may cease to be an object of\naversion and offense to every living thing and person, myself included?\"\n\nA long and uncomfortable silence ensued, which was perhaps not strange,\nconsidering the nature of the request. That I had blundered once more\nseemed likely enough, from the general suspense and the somewhat alarmed\nexpression of the old gentleman's countenance; nevertheless, my motives\nhad been good: I had expressed my wish in that way for the sake of peace\nand quietness, and fearing that if I had asked to be directed to the\nnearest clothing establishment, a new fit of amazement would have been\nthe result.\n\nFinding the silence intolerable, I at length ventured to remark that I\nfeared he had not understood me to the end.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" he answered gravely. \"Or, rather let me say, I hope not.\"\n\n\"May I explain my meaning?\" said I, greatly distressed.\n\n\"Assuredly you may,\" he replied with dignity. \"Only before you speak,\nlet me put this plain question to you: Do you ask us to provide you with\ngarments--that is to say, to bestow them as a gift on you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" I exclaimed, turning crimson with shame to think that\nthey were all taking me for a beggar. \"My wish is to obtain them somehow\nfrom somebody, since I cannot make them for myself, and to give in\nreturn their full value.\"\n\nI had no sooner spoken than I greatly feared that I had made matters\nworse; for here was I, a guest in the house, actually offering to\npurchase clothing--ready-made or to to order--from my host, who, for all\nI knew, might be one of the aristocracy of the country. My fears,\nhowever, proved quite groundless.\n\n\"I am glad to hear your explanation,\" he answered, \"for it has\ncompletely removed the unpleasant impression caused by your former\nwords. What can you do in return for the garments you are anxious to\npossess? And here, let me remark, I approve highly of your wish to\nescape, with the least possible delay, from your present covering. Do\nyou wish to confine yourself to the finishing of some work in a\nparticular line--as wood-carving, or stone, metal, clay or glass work;\nor in making or using colors? or have you only that general knowledge of\nthe various arts which would enable you to assist the more skilled in\npreparing materials?\"\n\n\"No, I am not an artist,\" I replied, surprised at his question. \"All I\ncan do is to buy the clothes--to pay for them in money.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that? What is money?\"\n\n\"Surely----\" I began, but fortunately checked myself in time, for I had\nmeant to suggest that he was pulling my leg. But it was really hard to\nbelieve that a person of his years did not know what money was. Besides,\nI could not answer the question, having always abhorred the study of\npolitical economy, which tells you all about it; so that I had never\nlearned to define money, but only how to spend it. Presently I thought\nthe best way out of the muddle was to show him some, and I accordingly\npulled out my big leather book-purse from my breast pocket. It had an\nancient, musty smell, like everything else about me, but seemed pretty\nheavy and well-filled, and I proceeded to open it and turn the contents\non the table. Eleven bright sovereigns and three half-crowns or florins,\nI forget which, rolled out; then, unfolding the papers, I discovered\nthree five-pound Bank of England notes.\n\n\"Surely this is very little for me to have about me!\" said I, feeling\ngreatly disappointed. \"I fancy I must have been making ducks and drakes\nof a lot of cash before--before--well, before I was--I don't know what,\nor when, or where.\"\n\nLittle notice was taken of this somewhat incoherent speech, for all were\nnow gathering round the table, examining the gold and notes with eager\ncuriosity. At length the old gentleman, pointing to the gold pieces,\nsaid: \"What are these?\"\n\n\"Sovereigns,\" I answered, not a little amused. \"Have you never seen any\nlike them before?\"\n\n\"Never. Let me examine them again. Yes, these eleven are of gold. They\nare all marked alike, on one side with a roughly-executed figure of a\nwoman's head, with the hair gathered on its summit in a kind of ball.\nThere are also other things on them which I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Can you not read the letters?\" I asked.\n\n\"No. The letters--if these marks are letters--are incomprehensible to\nme. But what have these small pieces of metal to do with the question of\nyour garments? You puzzle me.\"\n\n\"Why, everything. These pieces of metal, as you call them, are money,\nand represent, of course, so much buying power. I don't know yet what\nyour currency is, and whether you have the dollar or the rupee\"--here I\npaused, seeing that he did not follow me. \"My idea is this,\" I resumed,\nand coming down to very plain speaking: \"I can give one of these\nfive-pound notes, or its equivalent in gold, if you prefer that--five of\nthese sovereigns, I mean--for a suit of clothes such as you all wear.\"\n\nSo great was my desire to possess the clothes that I was about to double\nthe offer, which struck me as poor, and add that I would give ten\nsovereigns; but when I had spoken he dropped the piece he held in his\nhand upon the table, and stared fixedly at me, assisted by all the\nothers. Presently, in the profound silence which ensued, a low, silvery\ngurgling became audible, as of some merry mountain burn--a sweet,\nwarbling sound, swelling louder by degrees until it ended in a long\nringing peal of laughter.\n\nThis was from the girl Yoletta. I stared at her, surprised at her\nunseasonable levity; but the only effect of my doing so was a general\nexplosion, men and women joining in such a tempest of merriment that one\nmight have imagined they had just heard the most wonderful joke ever\ninvented since man acquired the sense of the ludicrous.\n\nThe old gentleman was the first to recover a decent gravity, although it\nwas plain to see that he struggled severely at intervals to prevent a\nrelapse.\n\n\"Smith,\" said he, \"of all the extraordinary delusions you appear to be\nsuffering from, this, that you can have garments to wear in return for a\nsmall piece of paper, or for a few bits of this metal, is the most\nastounding! You cannot exchange these trifles for clothes, because\nclothes are the fruit of much labor of many hands.\"\n\n\"And yet, sir, you said you understood me when I proposed to pay for the\nthings I require,\" said I, in an aggrieved tone. \"You seemed even to\napprove of the offer I made. How, then, am I to pay for them if all I\npossess is not considered of any value?\"\n\n\"_All_ you possess!\" he replied. \"Surely I did not say that! Surely\nyou possess the strength and skill common to all men, and can acquire\nanything you wish by the labor of your hands.\"\n\nI began once more to see light, although my skill, I knew, would not\ncount for much. \"Ah yes,\" I answered: \"to go back to that subject, I do\nnot know anything about wood-carving or using colors, but I might be\nable to do something--some work of a simpler kind.\"\n\n\"There are trees to be felled, land to be plowed, and many other things\nto be done. If you will do these things some one else will be released\nto perform works of skill; and as these are the most agreeable to the\nworker, it would please us more to have you labor in the fields than in\nthe workhouse.\"\n\n\"I am strong,\" I answered, \"and will gladly undertake labor of the kind\nyou speak of. There is, however, one difficulty. My desire is to change\nthese clothes for others which will be more pleasing to the eye, at\nonce; but the work I shall have to do in return will not be finished in\na day. Perhaps not in--well, several days.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" said he. \"A year's labor will be necessary to pay\nfor the garments you require.\"\n\nThis staggered me; for if the clothes were given to me at the beginning,\nthen before the end of the year they would be worn to rags, and I should\nmake myself a slave for life. I was sorely perplexed in mind, and pulled\nabout this way and that by the fear of incurring a debt, and the desire\nto see myself (and to be seen by Yoletta) in those strangely fascinating\ngarments. That I had a decent figure, and was not a bad-looking young\nfellow, I was pretty sure; and the hope that I should be able to create\nan impression (favorable, I mean) on the heart of that supremely\nbeautiful girl was very strong in me. At all events, by closing with the\noffer I should have a year of happiness in her society, and a year of\nhealthy work in the fields could not hurt me, or interfere much with my\nprospects. Besides, I was not quite sure that my prospects were really\nworth thinking about just now. Certainly, I had always lived\ncomfortably, spending money, eating and drinking of the best, and\ndressing well--that is, according to the London standard. And there was\nmy dear old bachelor Uncle Jack--John Smith, Member of Parliament for\nWormwood Scrubbs. That is to say, ex-Member; for, being a Liberal when\nthe great change came at the last general election, he was ignominiously\nousted from his seat, the Scrubbs proving at the finish a bitter place\nto him. He was put out in more ways than one, and tried to comfort\nhimself by saying that there would soon be another dissolution--thinking\nof his own, possibly, being an old man. I remembered that I had rather\nlooked forward to such a contingency, thinking how pleasant it would be\nto have all that money, and cruise about the world in my own yacht,\nenjoying myself as I knew how. And really I had some reason to hope. I\nremember he used to wind up the talk of an evening when I dined with him\n(and got a check) by saying: \"My boy, you have talents, if you'd only\nuse 'em.\" Where were those talents now? Certainly they had not made me\nshine much during the last few hours.\n\nNow, all this seemed unsubstantial, and I remembered these things dimly,\nlike a dream or a story told to me in childhood; and sometimes, when\nrecalling the past, I seemed to be thinking about ancient\nhistory--Sesostris, and the Babylonians and Assyrians, and that sort of\nthing. And, besides, it would be very hard to get back from a place\nwhere even the name of London was unknown. And perhaps, if I ever should\nsucceed in getting back, it would only be to encounter a second Roger\nTichborne case, or to be confronted with the statute of limitations.\nAnyhow, a year could not make much difference, and I should also keep my\nmoney, which seemed an advantage, though it wasn't much. I looked up:\nthey were all once more studying the coins and notes, and exchanging\nremarks about them.\n\n\"If I bind myself to work one year,\" said I, \"shall I have to wait until\nthe end of that time before I get the clothes?\"\n\nThe reply to this question, I thought, would settle the matter one way\nor the other.\n\n\"No,\" said he. \"It is your wish, and also ours, that you should be\ndifferently clothed at once, and the garments you require would be made\nfor you immediately.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said I, taking the desperate plunge, \"I should like to have them\nas soon as possible, and I am ready to commence work at once.\"\n\n\"You shall commence to-morrow morning,\" he answered, smiling at my\nimpetuosity. \"The daughters of the house, whose province it is to make\nthese things, shall also suspend other work until your garments are\nfinished. And now, my son, from this evening you are one of the house\nand one of us, and the things which we possess you also possess in\ncommon with us.\"\n\nI rose and thanked him. He too rose, and, after looking round on us with\na fatherly smile, went away to the interior of the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nWhen he was gone, and Yoletta had followed, leaving some of the others\nstill studying those wretched sovereigns, I sat down again and rested my\nchin on my hand; for I was now thinking--deeply: thinking on the terms\nof the agreement. \"I daresay I have succeeded in making a precious ass\nof myself,\" was the mental reflection that occurred to me--one I had not\ninfrequently made, and, what is more, been justified in making on former\noccasions. Then, remembering that I had come to supper with an\nextravagant appetite, it struck me that my host, quietly observant, had,\nwhen proposing terms, taken into account the quantity of food necessary\nfor my sustenance. I regretted too late that I had not exercised more\nrestraint; but the hungry man does not and cannot consider consequences,\nelse a certain hairy gentleman who figures in ancient history had never\nlent himself to that nefarious compact, which gave so great an advantage\nto a younger but sleek and well-nourished brother. In spite of all this,\nI felt a secret satisfaction in the thought of the clothes, and it was\nalso good to know that the nature of the work I had undertaken would not\nlower my status in the house.\n\nOccupied with these reflections, I had failed to observe that the\ncompany had gradually been drifting away until but one person was left\nwith me--the young man who had talked with me before. On his invitation\nI now rose, put by my money, and followed him. Returning by the hall we\nwent through a passage and entered a room of vast extent, which in its\nform and great length and high arched roof was like the nave of a\ncathedral. And yet how unlike in that something ethereal in its aspect,\nas of a nave in a cloud cathedral, its far-stretching shining floors and\nwalls and columns, pure white and pearl-gray, faintly touched with\ncolors of exquisite delicacy. And over it all was the roof of white or\npale gray glass tinged with golden-red--the roof which I had seen from\nthe outside when it seemed to me like a cloud resting on the stony\nsummit of a hill.\n\nOn coming in I had the impression of an empty, silent place; yet the\ninmates of the house were all there; they were sitting and reclining on\nlow couches, some lying at their ease on straw mats on the floor; some\nwere reading, others were occupied with some work in their hands, and\nsome were conversing, the sound coming to me like a faint murmur from a\ndistance.\n\nAt one side, somewhere about the center of the room, there was a broad\nraised place, or dais, with a couch on it, on which the father was\nreclining at his ease. Beside the couch stood a lectern on which a large\nvolume rested, and before him there was a brass box or cabinet, and\nbehind the couch seven polished brass globes were ranged, suspended on\naxles resting on bronze frames. These globes varied in size, the largest\nbeing not less than about twelve feet in circumference.\n\nI noticed that there were books on a low stand near me. They were all\nfolios, very much alike in form and thickness; and seeing presently that\nthe others were all following their own inclinations, and considering\nthat I had been left to my own resources and that it is a good plan when\nat Rome to do as the Romans do, I by-and-by ventured to help myself to a\nvolume, which I carried to one of the reading-stands.\n\nBooks are grand things--sometimes, thought I, prepared to follow the\nadvice I had received, and find out by reading all about the customs of\nthis people, especially their ideas concerning _The House_, which\nappeared to be an object of almost religious regard with them. This\nwould make me quite independent, and teach me how to avoid blundering in\nthe future, or giving expression to any more \"extraordinary delusions.\"\nOn opening the volume I was greatly surprised to find that it was richly\nilluminated on every leaf, the middle only of each page being occupied\nwith a rather narrow strip of writing; but the minute letters,\nresembling Hebrew characters, were incomprehensible to me. I bore the\ndisappointment very cheerfully, I must say, for I am not over-fond of\nstudy; and, besides, I could not have paid proper attention to the text,\nsurrounded with all that distracting beauty of graceful design and\nbrilliant coloring.\n\nAfter a while Yoletta came slowly across the room, her fingers engaged\nwith some kind of wool-work as she walked, and my heart beat fast when\nshe paused by my side.\n\n\"You are not reading,\" she said, looking curiously at me. \"I have been\nwatching you for some time.\"\n\n\"Have you indeed?\" said I, not knowing whether to feel flattered or not.\n\"No, unfortunately, I can't read this book, as I do not understand the\nletters. But what a wonderfully beautiful book it is! I was just\nthinking what some of the great London book-buyers--Quaritch, for\ninstance--would be tempted to give for it. Oh, I am forgetting--you have\nnever heard his name, of course; but--but what a beautiful book it is!\"\n\nShe said nothing in reply, and only looked a little\nsurprised--disgusted, I feared--at my ignorance, then walked away. I had\nhoped that she was going to talk to me, and with keen disappointment\nwatched her moving across the floor. All the glory seemed now to have\ngone out of the leaves of the volume, and I continued turning them over\nlistlessly, glancing at intervals at the beautiful girl, who was also\nlike one of the pages before me, wonderful to look at and hard to\nunderstand. In a distant part of the room I saw her place some cushions\non the floor, and settle herself on them to do her work.\n\nThe sun had set by this time, and the interior was growing darker by\ndegrees; the fading light, however, seemed to make no difference to\nthose who worked or read. They appeared to be gifted with an owlish\nvision, able to see with very little light. The father alone did\nnothing, but still rested on his couch, perhaps indulging in a\npostprandial nap. At length he roused himself and looked around him.\n\n\"There is no melody in our hearts this evening, my children,\" he said.\n\"When another day has passed over us it will perhaps be different.\nTo-night the voice so recently stilled in death forever would be too\npainfully missed by all of us.\"\n\nSome one then rose and brought a tall wax taper and placed it near him.\nThe flame threw a little brightness on the volume, which he now\nproceeded to open; and here and there, further away, it flashed and\ntrembled in points of rainbow-colored light on a tall column; but the\ngreater part of the room still remained in twilight obscurity.\n\nHe began to read aloud, and, although he did not seem to raise his voice\nabove its usual pitch, the words he uttered fell on my ears with a\ndistinctness and purity of sound which made them seem like a melody\n\"sweetly played in tune.\" The words he read related to life and death,\nand such solemn matters; but to my mind his theology seemed somewhat\nfantastical, although it is right to confess that I am no judge of such\nmatters. There was also a great deal about the _house_, which did\nnot enlighten me much, being too rhapsodical, and when he spoke about\nour conduct and aims in life, and things of that kind, I understood him\nlittle better. Here is a part of his discourse:--\n\n\"It is natural to grieve for those that die, because light and knowledge\nand love and joy are no longer theirs; but they grieve not any more,\nbeing now asleep on the lap of the Universal Mother, the bride of the\nFather, who is with us, sharing our sorrow, which was his first; but it\ndims not his everlasting brightness; and his desire and our glory is\nthat we should always and in all things resemble him.\n\n\"The end of every day is darkness, but the Father of life through our\nreason has taught us to mitigate the exceeding bitterness of our end;\notherwise, we that are above all other creatures in the earth should\nhave been at the last more miserable than they. For in the irrational\nworld, between the different kinds, there reigns perpetual strife and\nbloodshed, the strong devouring the weak and the incapable; and when\nfailure of life clouds the brightness of that lower soul, which is\ntheirs, the end is not long delayed. Thus the life that has lasted many\ndays goes out with a brief pang, and in its going gives new vigor to the\nstrong that have yet many days to live. Thus also does the ever-living\nearth from the dust of dead generations of leaves re-make a fresh\nfoliage, and for herself a new garment.\n\n\"We only, of all things having life, being like the Father, slay not nor\nare slain, and are without enemies in the earth; for even the lower\nkinds, which have not reason, know without reason that we are highest on\nthe earth, and see in us, alone of all his works, the majesty of the\nFather, and lose all their rage in our presence. Therefore, when the\nnight is near, when life is a burden and we remember our mortality, we\nhasten the end, that those we love may cease to sorrow at the sight of\nour decline; and we know that this is his will who called us into being,\nand gave us life and joy on the earth for a season, but not forever.\n\n\"It is better to lay down the life that is ours, to leave all\nthings--the love of our kindred; the beauty of the world and of the\nhouse; the labor in which we take delight, to go forth and be no more;\nbut the bitterness endures not, and is scarcely tasted when in our last\nmoments we remember that our labor has borne fruit; that the letters we\nhave written perish not with us, but remain as a testimony and a joy to\nsucceeding generations, and live in the house forever.\n\n\"For the house is the image of the world, and we that live and labor in\nit are the image of our Father who made the world; and, like him, we\nlabor to make for ourselves a worthy habitation, which shall not shame\nour teacher. This is his desire; for in all his works, and that\nknowledge which is like pure water to one that thirsts, and satisfies\nand leaves no taste of bitterness on the palate, we learn the will of\nhim that called us into life. All the knowledge we seek, the invention\nand skill we possess, and the labor of our hands, has this purpose only:\nfor all knowledge and invention and labor having any other purpose\nwhatsoever is empty and vain in comparison, and unworthy of those that\nare made in the image of the Father of life. For just as the bodily\nsenses may become perverted, and the taste lose its discrimination, so\nthat the hungry man will devour acrid fruits and poisonous herbs for\naliment, so is the mind capable of seeking out new paths, and a\nknowledge which leads only to misery and destruction.\n\n\"Thus we know that in the past men sought after knowledge of various\nkinds, asking not whether it was for good or for evil: but every offense\nof the mind and the body has its appropriate reward; and while their\nknowledge grew apace, that better knowledge and discrimination which the\nFather gives to every living soul, both in man and in beast, was taken\nfrom them. Thus by increasing their riches they were made poorer; and,\nlike one who, forgetting the limits that are set to his faculties, gazes\nsteadfastly on the sun, by seeing much they become afflicted with\nblindness. But they know not their poverty and blindness, and were not\nsatisfied; but were like shipwrecked men on a lonely and barren rock in\nthe midst of the sea, who are consumed with thirst, and drink of no\nsweet spring, but of the bitter wave, and thirst, and drink again, until\nmadness possesses their brains, and death releases them from their\nmisery. Thus did they thirst, and drink again, and were crazed; being\ninflamed with the desire to learn the secrets of nature, hesitating not\nto dip their hands in blood, seeking in the living tissues of animals\nfor the hidden springs of life. For in their madness they hoped by\nknowledge to gain absolute dominion over nature, thereby taking from the\nFather of the world his prerogative.\n\n\"But their vain ambition lasted not, and the end of it was death. The\nmadness of their minds preyed on their bodies, and worms were bred in\ntheir corrupted flesh: and these, after feeding on their tissues,\nchanged their forms; and becoming winged, flew out in the breath of\ntheir nostrils, like clouds of winged ants that issue in the springtime\nfrom their breeding-places; and, flying from body to body, filled the\nrace of men in all places with corruption and decay; and the Mother of\nmen was thus avenged of her children for their pride and folly, for they\nperished miserably, devoured of worms.\n\n\"Of the human race only a small remnant survived, these being men of an\nhumble mind, who had lived apart and unknown to their fellows; and after\nlong centuries they went forth into the wilderness of earth and\nrepeopled it; but nowhere did they find any trace or record of those\nthat had passed away; for earth had covered all their ruined works with\nher dark mold and green forests, even as a man hides unsightly scars on\nhis body with a new and beautiful garment. Nor is it known to us when\nthis destruction fell upon the race of men; we only know that the\nhistory thereof was graven an hundred centuries ago on the granite\npillars of the House of Evor, on the plains between the sea and the\nsnow-covered mountains of Elf. Thither in past ages some of our pilgrims\njourneyed, and have brought a record of these things; nor in our house\nonly are they known, but in many houses throughout the world have they\nbeen written for the instruction of all men and a warning for all time.\n\n\"But to mankind there shall come no second darkness of error, nor\nseeking after vain knowledge; and in the Father's House there shall be\nno second desolation, but the sounds of joy and melody, which were\nsilent, shall be heard everlastingly; since we had now continued long in\nthis even mind, seeking only to inform ourselves of his will; until as\nin a clear crystal without flaw shining with colored light, or as a\nglassy lake reflecting within itself the heavens and every cloud and\nstar, so is he reflected in our minds; and in the house we are his\nviceregents, and in the world his co-workers; and for the glory which he\nhas in his work we have a like glory in ours.\n\n\"He is our teacher. Morning and evening throughout the various world, in\nthe procession of the seasons, and in the blue heavens powdered with\nstars; in mountain and plain and many-toned forest; in the sounding\nwalls of the ocean, and in the billowy seas through which we pass in\nperil from land to land, we read his thoughts and listen to his voice.\nHere do we learn with what far-seeing intelligence he has laid the\nfoundations of his everlasting mansion, how skillfully he has builded\nits walls, and with what prodigal richness he has decorated all his\nworks. For the sunlight and moonlight and the blueness of heaven are\nhis; the sea with its tides; the blackness and the lightnings of the\ntempest, and snow, and changeful winds, and green and yellow leaf; his\nare also the silver rain and the rainbow, the shadows and the\nmany-colored mists, which he flings like a mantle over all the world.\nHerein do we learn that he loves a stable building, and that the\nfoundations and walls shall endure for ever: yet loves not sameness;\nthus, from day to day and from season to season do all things change\ntheir aspect, and the walls and floor and roof of his dwelling are\ncovered with a new glory. But to us it is not given to rise to this\nsupreme majesty in our works; therefore do we, like him yet unable to\nreach so great a height, borrow nothing one from the other, but in each\nhouse learn separately from him alone who has infinite riches; so that\nevery habitation, changeless and eternal in itself, shall yet differ\nfrom all others, having its own special beauty and splendor: for we\ninhabit one house only, but the Father of men inhabits all.\n\n\"These things are written for the refreshment and delight of those who\nmay no longer journey into distant lands; and they are in the library of\nthe house in the seven thousand volumes of the Houses of the World which\nour pilgrims have visited in past ages. For once in a lifetime is it\nordained that a man shall leave his own place and travel for the space\nof ten years, visiting the most famous houses in every land he enters,\nand also seeking out those of which no report has reached us.\n\n\"When the time for this chief adventure comes, and we go forth for a\nlong period, there is compensation for every weariness, with absence of\nkindred and the sweet shelter of our own home: for now do we learn the\ninfinite riches of the Father; for just as the day changes every hour,\nfrom the morning to the evening twilight, so does the aspect of the\nworld alter as we progress from day to day; and in all places our\nfellow-men, learning as we do from him only, and seeing that which is\nnearest, give a special color of nature to their lives and their houses;\nand every house, with the family which inhabits it, in their\nconversation and the arts in which they excel, is like a round lake set\nabout with hills, wherein may be seen that visible world. And in all the\nearth there is no land without inhabitants, whether on wide continents\nor islands of the sea; and in all nature there is no grandeur or beauty\nor grace which men have not copied; knowing that this is pleasing to the\nFather: for we, that are made like him, delight not to work without\nwitnesses; and we are his witnesses in the earth, taking pleasure in his\nworks, even as he also does in ours.\n\n\"Thus, at the beginning of our journey to the far south, where we go to\nlook first on those bright lands, which have hotter suns and a greater\nvariety than ours, we come to the wilderness of Coradine, which seems\nbarren and desolate to our sight, accustomed to the deep verdure of\nwoods and valleys, and the blue mists of an abundant moisture. There a\nstony soil brings forth only thorns, and thistles, and sere tufts of\ngrass; and blustering winds rush over the unsheltered reaches, where the\nrough-haired goats huddle for warmth; and there is no melody save the\nmany-toned voices of the wind and the plover's wild cry. There dwell the\nchildren of Coradine, on the threshold of the wind-vexed wilderness,\nwhere the stupendous columns of green glass uphold the roof of the House\nof Coradine; the ocean's voice is in their rooms, and the inland-blowing\nwind brings to them the salt spray and yellow sand swept at low tide\nfrom the desolate floors of the sea, and the white-winged bird flying\nfrom the black tempest screams aloud in their shadowy halls. There, from\nthe high terraces, when the moon is at its full, we see the children of\nCoradine gathered together, arrayed like no others, in shining garments\nof gossamer threads, when, like thistle-down chased by eddying winds,\nnow whirling in a cloud, now scattering far apart, they dance their\nmoonlight dances on the wide alabaster floors; and coming and going they\npass away, and seem to melt into the moonlight, yet ever to return again\nwith changeful melody and new measures. And, seeing this, all those\nthings in which we ourselves excel seem poor in comparison, becoming\npale in our memories. For the winds and waves, and the whiteness and\ngrace, has been ever with them; and the winged seed of the thistle, and\nthe flight of the gull, and the storm-vexed sea, flowering in foam, and\nthe light of the moon on sea and barren land, have taught them this art,\nand a swiftness and grace which they alone possess.\n\n\"Yet does this moonlight dance, which is the chief glory of the House of\nCoradine, grow pale in the mind, and is speedily forgotten, when another\nis seen; and, going on our way from house to house, we learn how\neverywhere the various riches of the world have been taken into his soul\nby man, and made part of his life. Nor are we inferior to others, having\nalso an art and chief excellence which is ours only, and the fame of\nwhich has long gone forth into the world; so that from many distant\nlands pilgrims gather yearly to our fields to listen to our harvest\nmelody, when the sun-ripened fruits have been garnered, and our lips and\nhands make undying music, to gladden the hearts of those that hear it\nall their lives long. For then do we rejoice beyond others, rising like\nbright-winged insects from our lowly state to a higher life of glory and\njoy, which is ours for the space of three whole days. Then the august\nMother, in a brazen chariot, is drawn from field to field by milk-white\nbulls with golden horns; then her children are gathered about her in\nshining yellow garments, with armlets of gold upon their arms; and with\nvoice and instruments of forms unknown to the stranger, they make glad\nthe listening fields with the great harvest melody.\n\n\"In ancient days the children of our house conceived it in their hearts,\nhearing it in all nature's voices; and it was with them day and night,\nand they whispered it to one another when it was no louder than the\nwhisper of the wind in the forest leaves; and as the Builder of the\nworld brings from an hundred far places the mist, and the dew, and the\nsunshine, and the light west wind, to give to the morning hour its\nfreshness and glory; and as we, his humbler followers, seek far off in\ncaverns of the hills and in the dark bowels of the earth for minerals\nand dyes that outshine the flowers and the sun, to beautify the walls of\nour house, so everywhere by night and day for long centuries did we\nlisten to all sounds, and made their mystery and melody ours, until this\ngreat song was perfected in our hearts, and the fame of it in all lands\nhas caused our house to be called the House of the Harvest Melody; and\nwhen the yearly pilgrims behold our procession in the fields, and listen\nto our song, all the glory of the world seems to pass before them,\novercoming their hearts, until, bursting into tears and loud cries, they\ncast themselves upon the earth and worship the Father of the whole\nworld.\n\n\"This shall be the chief glory of our house for ever; when a thousand\nyears have gone by, and we that are now living, like those that have\nbeen, are mingled with the nature we come from, and speak to our\nchildren only in the wind's voice, and the cry of the passage-bird,\npilgrims shall still come to these sun-bright fields, to rejoice, and\nworship the Father of the world, and bless the august Mother of the\nhouse, from whose sacred womb ever comes to it life and love and joy,\nand the harvest melody that shall endure for ever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe reading went on, not of course \"for ever,\" like that harvest melody\nhe spoke of, but for a considerable time. The words, I concluded, were\nfor the initiated, and not for me, and after a while I gave up trying to\nmake out what it was all about. Those last expressions I have quoted\nabout the \"august Mother of the house\" were unintelligible, and appeared\nto me meaningless. I had already come to the conclusion that however\nmany of the ladies of the establishment might have experienced the\npleasures and pains of maternity, there was really no mother of the\nhouse in the sense that there was a father of the house: that is to say,\none possessing authority over the others and calling them all her\nchildren indiscriminately. Yet this mysterious non-existent mother of\nthe house was continually being spoken of, as I found now and afterwards\nwhen I listened to the talk around me. After thinking the matter over, I\ncame to the conclusion that \"mother of the house\" was merely a\nconvenient fiction, and simply stood for the general sense of the\nwomen-folk, or something of the sort. It was perhaps stupid of me, but\nthe story of Mistrelde, who died young, leaving only eight children, I\nhad regarded as a mere legend or fable of antiquity.\n\nTo return to the reading. Just as I had been absorbed before in that\nbeautiful book without being able to read it, so now I listened to that\nmelodious and majestic voice, experiencing a singular pleasure without\nproperly understanding the sense. I remembered now with a painful\nfeeling of inferiority that my _thick_ speech had been remarked On\nearlier in the day; and I could not but think that, compared with the\nspeech of this people, it was thick. In their rare physical beauty, the\ncolor of their eyes and hair, and in their fascinating dress, they had\nstruck me as being utterly unlike any people ever seen by me. But it was\nperhaps in their clear, sweet, penetrative voice, which sometimes\nreminded me of a tender-toned wind instrument, that they most differed\nfrom others.\n\nThe reading, I have said, had struck me as almost of the nature of a\nreligious service; nevertheless, everything went on as before--reading,\nworking, and occasional conversation; but the subdued talking and moving\nabout did not interfere with one's pleasure in the old man's musical\nspeech any more than the soft murmur and flying about of honey bees\nwould prevent one from enjoying the singing of a skylark. Emboldened by\nwhat I saw the others doing, I left my seat and made my way across the\nfloor to Yoletta's side, stealing through the gloom with great caution\nto avoid making a clatter with those abominable boots.\n\n\"May I sit down near you?\" said I with some hesitation; but she\nencouraged me with a smile and placed a cushion for me.\n\nI settled myself down in the most graceful position I could assume,\nwhich was not at all graceful, doubling my objectionable legs out of her\nsight; and then began my trouble, for I was greatly perplexed to know\nwhat to say to her. I thought of lawn-tennis and archery. Ellen Terry's\nacting, the Royal Academy Exhibition, private theatricals, and twenty\nthings besides, but they all seemed unsuitable subjects to start\nconversation with in this case. There was, I began to fear, no common\nground on which we could meet and exchange thoughts, or, at any rate,\nwords. Then I remembered that ground, common and broad enough, of our\nhuman feelings, especially the sweet and important feeling of love. But\nhow was I to lead up to it? The work she was engaged with at length\nsuggested an opening, and the opportunity to make a pretty little\nspeech.\n\n\"Your sight must be as good as your eyes are pretty,\" said I, \"to enable\nyou to work in such a dim light.\"\n\n\"Oh, the light is good enough,\" she answered, taking no notice of the\ncompliment. \"Besides, this is such easy work I could do it in the dark.\"\n\n\"It is very pretty work--may I look at it?\"\n\nShe handed the stuff to me, but instead of taking it in the ordinary\nway, I placed my hand under hers, and, holding up cloth and hand\ntogether, proceeded to give a minute and prolonged scrutiny to her work.\n\n\"Do you know that I am enjoying two distinct pleasures at one and the\nsame time?\" said I. \"One is in seeing your work, the other in holding\nyour hand; and I think the last pleasure even greater than the first.\"\nAs she made no reply, I added somewhat lamely: \"May I--keep on holding\nit?\"\n\n\"That would prevent me from working,\" she answered, with the utmost\ngravity. \"But you may hold it for a little while.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" I exclaimed, delighted with the privilege; and then, to\nmake the most of my precious \"little while,\" I pressed it warmly,\nwhereupon she cried out aloud: \"Oh, Smith, you are squeezing too\nhard--you hurt my hand!\"\n\nI dropped it instantly in the greatest confusion. \"Oh, for goodness\nsake,\" I stammered, \"please, do not make such an outcry! You don't know\nwhat a hobble you'll get me into.\"\n\nFortunately, no notice was taken of the exclamation, though it was hard\nto believe that her words had not been overheard; and presently,\nrecovering from my fright, I apologized for hurting her, and hoped she\nwould forgive me.\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive,\" she returned gently. \"You did not really\nsqueeze hard, only my hand hurts, because to-day when I pressed it on\nthe ground beside the grave I ran a small thorn into it.\" Then the\nremembrance of that scene at the burial brought a sudden mist of tears\ninto her lovely eyes.\n\n\"I am so sorry I hurt you, Yoletta--may I call you Yoletta?\" said I, all\nat once remembering that she had called me Smith, without the customary\nprefix.\n\n\"Why, that is my name--what else should you call me?\" she returned,\nevidently with surprise.\n\n\"It is a pretty name, and so sweet on the lips that I should like to be\nrepeating it continually,\" I answered. \"But it is only right that you\nshould have a pretty name, because--well, if I may tell you, because you\nare so very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Yes; but is that strange--are not all people beautiful?\"\n\nI thought of certain London types, especially among the \"criminal\nclasses,\" and of the old women with withered, simian faces and wearing\nshawls, slinking in or out of public-houses at the street corners; and\nalso of some people of a better class I had known personally--some even\nin the House of Commons; and I felt that I could not agree with her,\nmuch as I wished to do so, without straining my conscience.\n\n\"At all events, you will allow,\" said I, evading the question, \"that\nthere are _degrees_ of beauty, just as there are degrees of light.\nYou may be able to see to work in this light, but it is very faint\ncompared with the noonday light when the sun is shining.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is not so great a difference between people as _that_,\"\nshe replied, with the air of a philosopher. \"There are different kinds\nof beauty, I allow, and some people seem more beautiful to us than\nothers, but that is only because we love them more. The best loved are\nalways the most beautiful.\"\n\nThis seemed to reverse the usual idea, that the more beautiful the\nperson is the more he or she gets loved. However, I was not going to\ndisagree with her any more, and only said: \"How sweetly you talk,\nYoletta; you are as wise as you are beautiful. I could wish for no\ngreater pleasure than to sit here listening to you the whole evening.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, I am sorry I must leave you now,\" she answered, with a bright\nsmile which made me think that perhaps my little speech had pleased her.\n\n\"Do you wonder why I smile?\" she added, as if able to read my thoughts.\n\"It is because I have often heard words like yours from one who is\nwaiting for me now.\"\n\nThis speech caused me a jealous pang. But for a few moments after\nspeaking, she continued regarding me with that bright, spiritual smile\non her lips; then it faded, and her face clouded and her glance fell. I\ndid not ask her to tell me, nor did I ask myself, the reason of that\nchange; and afterwards how often I noticed that same change in her, and\nin the others too--that sudden silence and clouding of the face, such as\nmay be seen in one who freely expresses himself to a person who cannot\nhear, and then, all at once but too late, remembers the other's\ninfirmity.\n\n\"Must you go?\" I only said. \"What shall I do alone?\".\n\n\"Oh, you shall not be alone,\" she replied, and going away returned\npresently with another lady. \"This is Edra,\" she said simply. \"She will\ntake my place by your side and talk with you.\"\n\nI could not tell her that she had taken my words too literally, that\nbeing alone simply meant being separated from her; but there was no help\nfor it, and some one, alas! some one I greatly hated was waiting for\nher. I could only thank her and her friend for their kind intentions.\nBut what in the name of goodness was I to say to this beautiful woman\nwho was sitting by me? She was certainly very beautiful, with a far more\nmature and perhaps a nobler beauty than Yoletta's, her age being about\ntwenty-seven or twenty-eight; but the divine charm in the young girl's\nface could, for me, exist in no other.\n\nPresently she opened the conversation by asking me if I disliked being\nalone.\n\n\"Well, no, perhaps not exactly that,\" I said; \"but I think it much\njollier--much more pleasant, I mean--to have some very nice person to\ntalk to.\"\n\nShe assented, and, pleased at her ready intelligence, I added: \"And it\nis particularly pleasant when you are understood. But I have no fear\nthat you, at any rate, will fail to understand anything I may say.\"\n\n\"You have had some trouble to-day,\" she returned, with a charming smile.\n\"I sometimes think that women can understand even more readily than\nmen.\"\n\n\"There's not a doubt of it!\" I returned warmly, glad to find that with\nEdra it was all plain sailing. \"It must be patent to every one that\nwomen have far quicker, finer intellects than men, although their brains\nare smaller; but then quality is more important than mere quantity. And\nyet,\" I continued, \"some people hold that women ought not to have the\nfranchise, or suffrage, or whatever it is! Not that I care two straws\nabout the question myself, and I only hope they'll never get it; but\nthen I think it is so illogical--don't you?\"\n\n\"I am afraid I do not understand you, Smith,\" she returned, looking much\ndistressed.\n\n\"Well, no, I suppose not, but what I said was of no consequence,\" I\nreplied; then, wishing to make a fresh start, I added: \"But I am so glad\nto hear you call me Smith. It makes it so much more pleasant and\nhomelike to be treated without formality. It is very kind of you, I'm\nsure.\"\n\n\"But surely your name is Smith?\" said she, looking very much surprised.\n\n\"Oh yes, my name is Smith: only of course--well, the tact is, I was just\nwondering what to call you.\"\n\n\"My name is Edra,\" she replied, looking more bewildered than ever; and\nfrom that moment the conversation, which had begun so favorably, was\nnothing but a series of entanglements, from which I could only escape in\neach case by breaking the threads of the subject under discussion, and\nintroducing a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nThe moment of retiring, to which I had been looking forward with\nconsiderable interest as one likely to bring fresh surprises, arrived at\nlast: it brought only extreme discomfort. I was conducted (without a\nflat candlestick) along an obscure passage; then, at right angles with\nthe first, a second broader, lighter passage, leading past a great many\ndoors placed near together. These, I ascertained later, were the\ndormitories, or sleeping-cells, and were placed side by side in a row\nopening on the terrace at the back of the house. Having reached the door\nof my box, my conductor pushed back the sliding-panel, and when I had\ngroped my way to the dark interior, closed it again behind me. There was\nno light for me except the light of the stars; for directly opposite the\ndoor by which I had entered stood another, open wide to the night, which\nwas apparently not intended ever to be closed. The prospect was the one\nI had already seen--the wilderness sloping to the river, and the glassy\nsurface of the broad water, reflecting the stars, and the black masses\nof large trees. There was no sound save the hooting of an owl in the\ndistance, and the wailing note of some mournful-minded water-fowl. The\nnight air blew in cold and moist, which made my bones ache, though they\nwere not broken; and feeling very sleepy and miserable, I groped about\nuntil I Was rewarded by discovering a narrow bed, or cot of\ntrellis-work, on which was a hard straw pallet and a small straw pillow;\nalso, folded small, a kind of woolen sleeping garment. Too tired to keep\nout of even such an uninviting bed, I flung off my clothes, and with my\nmoldy tweeds for only covering I laid me down, but not to sleep. The\nmisery of it! for although my body was warm--too warm, in fact--the wind\nblew on my face and bare feet and legs, and made it impossible to sleep.\n\nAbout midnight, I was just falling into a doze when a sound as of a\nperson coming with a series of jumps into the room disturbed me; and\nstarting up I was horrified to see, sitting on the floor, a great beast\nmuch too big for a dog, with large, erect ears. He was intently watching\nme, his round eyes shining like a pair of green phosphorescent globes.\nHaving no weapon, I was at the brute's mercy, and was about to utter a\nloud shout to summon assistance, but as he sat so still I refrained, and\nbegan even to hope that he would go quietly away. Then he stood up, went\nback to the door and sniffed audibly at it; and thinking that he was\nabout to relieve me of his unwelcome presence, I dropped my head on the\npillow and lay perfectly still. Then he turned and glared at me again,\nand finally, advancing deliberately to my side, sniffed at my face. It\nwas all over with me now, I thought, and closing my eyes, and feeling my\nforehead growing remarkably moist in spite of the cold, I murmured a\nlittle prayer. When I looked again the brute had vanished, to my\ninexpressible relief.\n\nIt seemed very astonishing that an animal like a wolf should come into\nthe house; but I soon remembered that I had seen no dogs about, so that\nall kinds of savage, prowling beasts could come in with impunity. It was\ngetting beyond a joke: but then all this seemed only a fit ending to the\nperfectly absurd arrangement into which I had been induced to enter.\n\"Goodness gracious!\" I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright on my straw bed,\n\"am I a rational being or an inebriated donkey, or what, to have\nconsented to such a proposal? It is clear that I was not quite in my\nright mind when I made the agreement, and I am therefore not morally\nbound to observe it. What! be a field laborer, a hewer of wood and\ndrawer of water, and sleep on a miserable straw mat in an open porch,\nwith wolves for visitors at all hours of the night, and all for a few\nbarbarous rags! I don't know much about plowing and that sort of thing,\nbut I suppose any able-bodied man can earn a pound a week, and that\nwould be fifty-two pounds for a suit of clothes. Who ever heard of such\na thing! Wolves and all thrown in for nothing! I daresay I shall have a\ntiger dropping in presently just to have a look round. No, no, my\nvenerable friend, that was all excellent acting about my extraordinary\ndelusions, and the rest of it, but I am not going to be carried so far\nby them as to adhere to such an outrageously one-sided bargain.\"\n\nPresently I remembered two things--divine Yoletta was the first; and the\nsecond was that thought of the rare pleasure it would be to array myself\nin those same \"barbarous rags,\" as I had blasphemously called them.\nThese things had entered into my soul, and had become a part of\nme--especially--well, both. Those strange garments had looked so\nrefreshingly picturesque, and I had conceived such an intense longing to\nwear them! Was it a very contemptible ambition on my part? Is it sinful\nto wish for any adornments other than wisdom and sobriety, a meek and\nloving spirit, good works, and other things of the kind? Straight into\nmy brain flashed the words of a sentence I had recently read--that is to\nsay, just before my accident--in a biological work, and it comforted me\nas much as if an angel with shining face and rainbow-colored wings had\npaid me a visit in my dusky cell: \"Unto Adam also, and his wife, did the\nLord God make coats of skin and clothed them. This has become, as every\none knows, a custom among the race of men, and shows at present no sign\nof becoming obsolete. Moreover, that first correlation, namely,\nmilk-glands and a hairy covering, appears to have entered the very soul\nof creatures of this class, and to have become psychical as well as\nphysical, for in that type, which is only _for a while_ inferior to\nthe angels, the fondness for this kind of outer covering is a strong,\nineradicable passion!\" Most true and noble words, O biologist of the\nfiery soul! It was a delight to remember them. A \"strong and\nineradicable passion,\" not merely to clothe the body, but to clothe it\nappropriately, that is to say, beautifully, and by so doing please God\nand ourselves. This being so, must we go on for ever scraping our faces\nwith a sharp iron, until they are blue and spotty with manifold\nscrapings; and cropping our hair short to give ourselves an artificial\nresemblance to old dogs and monkeys--creatures lower than us in the\nscale of being--and array our bodies, like mutes at a funeral, in\nrepulsive black--we, \"Eutheria of the Eutheria, the noble of the noble?\"\nAnd all for what, since it pleases not heaven nor accords with our own\ndesires? For the sake of respectability, perhaps, whatever that may\nmean. Oh, then, a million curses take it--respectability, I mean; may it\nsink into the bottomless pit, and the smoke of its torment ascend for\never and ever! And having thus, by taking thought, brought my mind into\nthis temper, I once more finally determined to have the clothes, and\nreligiously to observe the compact.\n\nIt made me quite happy to end it in this way. The hard bed, the cold\nnight wind blowing on me, my wolfish visitor, were all forgotten. Once\nmore I gave loose to my imagination, and saw myself (clothed and in my\nright mind) sitting at Yoletta's feet, learning the mystery of that\nsweet, tranquil life from her precious lips. A whole year was mine in\nwhich to love her and win her gentle heart. But her hand--ah, that was\nanother matter. What had I to give in return for such a boon as that?\nOnly that strength concerning which my venerable host had spoken\nsomewhat encouragingly. He had also been so good as to mention my skill;\nbut I could scarcely trade on that. And if a whole year's labor was only\nsufficient to pay for a suit of clothing, how many years of toil would\nbe required to win Yoletta's hand?\n\nNaturally, at this juncture, I began to draw a parallel between my case\nand that of an ancient historical personage, whose name is familiar to\nmost. History repeats itself--with variations. Jacob--namely,\nSmith--cometh to the well of Haran. He taketh acquaintance of Rachel,\nhere called Yoletta. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice\nand wept. That is a touch of nature I can thoroughly appreciate--the\nkissing, I mean; but why he wept I cannot tell, unless it be because he\nwas not an Englishman. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's\nbrother. I am glad to have no such startling piece of information to\ngive to the object of my affections: we are not even distant relations,\nand her age being, say, fifteen, and mine twenty-one, we are so far well\nsuited to each other, according to my notions. Smith covenanted! for\nYoletta, and said: \"I will serve thee seven years for Yoletta, thy\nyounger daughter\"; and the old gentleman answered: \"Abide with me, for I\nwould rather you should have her than some other person.\" Now I wonder\nwhether the matter will be complicated with Leah--that is, Edra? Leah\nwas considerably older than Rachel, and, like Edra, tender-eyed. I do\nnot aspire or desire to marry both, especially if I should, like Jacob,\nhave to begin with the wrong one, however tender-eyed: but for divine\nYoletta I could serve seven years; yea, and fourteen, if it comes to it.\n\nThus I mused, and thus I questioned, tossing and turning on my\ninhospitable hard bed, until merciful sleep laid her quieting hands on\nthe strings of my brain, and hushed their weary jangling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nFortunately I woke early next morning, for I was now a member of an\nearly-rising family, and anxious to conform to rules. On going to the\ndoor I found, to my inexpressible disgust, that I might easily have\nclosed it in the way I had seen the other door closed, by simply pulling\na sliding panel. There was ventilation enough without having the place\nopen to prowling beasts of prey. I also found that if I had turned up\nthe little stray bed I should have had warm woolen sheets to sleep in.\n\nI resolved to say nothing about my nocturnal visitor, not wishing to\nbegin the day by furnishing fresh instances of what might seem like\ncrass stupidity on my part. While occupied with these matters I began to\nhear people moving about and talking on the terrace, and peeping out, I\nbeheld a curious and interesting spectacle. Down the broad steps leading\nto the water the people of the house were hurrying, and flinging\nthemselves like agile, startled frogs on the bosom of the stream. There,\nin the midst of his family, my venerable host was already disporting\nhimself, his long, silvery beard and hair floating like a foam on the\nwaves of his own creating. And presently from other sleeping-rooms on a\nline with mine shot forth new bewitching forms, each sparsely clothed in\na slender clinging garment, which concealed no beauteous curve beneath;\nand nimbly running and leaping down the slope, they quickly joined the\nmasculine bathers.\n\nLooking about I soon found a pretty thing in which to array myself, and\nquickly started after the others, risking my neck in my desire to\nimitate the new mode of motion I had just witnessed. The water was\ndelightfully cool and refreshing, and the company very agreeable, ladies\nand gentlemen all swimming and diving about together with the\nunconventional freedom and grace of a company of grebes.\n\nAfter dressing, we assembled in the eating-room or portico where we had\nsupped, just when the red disk of the sun was showing itself above the\nhorizon, kindling the clouds with yellow flame, and filling the green\nworld with new light. I felt happy and strong that morning, very able\nand willing to work in the fields, and, better than all, very hopeful\nabout that affair of the heart. Happiness, however, is seldom perfect,\nand in the clear, tender morning light I could not help contrasting my\nown repulsively ugly garments with the bright and beautiful costumes\nworn by the others, which seemed to harmonize so well with their fresh,\nhappy morning mood. I also missed the fragrant cup of coffee, the\nstreaky rasher from the dear familiar pig, and, after breakfast, the\nwell-flavored cigar; but these lesser drawbacks were soon forgotten.\n\nAfter the meal a small closed basket was handed to me, and one of the\nyoung men led me out to a little distance from the house, then, pointing\nto a belt of wood about a mile away, told me to walk towards it until I\ncame to a plowed field on the slope of a valley, where I could do some\nplowing. Before leaving me he took from his own person a metal\ndog-whistle, with a string attached, and hung it round my neck, but\nwithout explaining its use.\n\nBasket in hand I went away, over the dewy grass, whistling\nlight-heartedly, and after half an hour's walk found the spot indicated,\nwhere about an acre and a half of land had been recently turned; there\nalso, lying in the furrow, I found the plow, an implement I knew very\nlittle about. This particular plow, however, appeared to be a simple,\nprimitive thing, consisting of a long beam of wood, with an upright pole\nto guide it; a metal share in the center, going off to one side,\nbalanced on the other by a couple of small wheels; and there were also\nsome long ropes attached to a cross-stick at the end of the beam. There\nbeing no horses or bullocks to do the work, and being unable to draw the\nplow myself as well as guide it, I sat down leisurely to examine the\ncontents of my basket, which, I found, consisted of brown bread, dried\nfruit, and a stone bottle of milk. Then, not knowing what else to do, I\nbegan to amuse myself by blowing on the whistle, and emitted a most\nshrill and piercing sound, which very soon produced an unexpected\neffect. Two noble-looking horses, resembling those I had seen the day\nbefore, came galloping towards me as if in response to the sound I had\nmade. Approaching swiftly to within fifty yards they stood still,\nstaring and snorting as if alarmed or astonished, after which they swept\nround me three or four times, neighing in a sharp, ringing manner, and\nfinally, after having exhausted their superfluous energy, they walked to\nthe plow and placed themselves deliberately before it. It looked as if\nthese animals had come at my call to do the work; I therefore approached\nthem, with more than needful caution, using many soothing, conciliatory\nsounds and words the while, and after a little further study I\ndiscovered how to adjust the ropes to them. There were no blinkers or\nreins, nor did these superb animals seem to think any were wanted; but\nafter I had taken the pole in my hand, and said \"Gee up, Dobbin,\" in a\ntone of command, followed by some inarticulate clicks with the tongue,\nthey rewarded me with a disconcerting stare, and then began dragging the\nplow. As long as I held the pole straight the share cut its way evenly\nthrough the mold, but occasionally, owing to my inadvertence, it would\ngo off at a tangent or curve quite out of the ground; and whenever this\nhappened the horses would stop, turn round and stare at me, then,\ntouching their noses together seem to exchange ideas on the subject.\nWhen the first furrow was finished, they did not double back, as I\nexpected, but went straight away to a distance of thirty yards, and\nthen, turning, marched back, cutting a fresh furrow parallel with the\nfirst, and as straight as a line. Then they returned to the original\nstarting-point and cut another, then again to the new furrow, and so on\nprogressively. All this seemed very wonderful to me, giving the\nimpression that I had been a skillful plowman all my life without\nknowing it. It was interesting work; and I was also amused to see the\nlittle birds that came in numbers from the wood to devour the worms in\nthe fresh-turned mold; for between their fear of me and their desire to\nget the worms, they were in a highly perplexed state, and generally\nconfined their operations to one end of the furrow while I was away at\nthe other. The space the horses had marked out for themselves was plowed\nup in due time, whereupon they marched off and made a fresh furrow as\nbefore, where there was nothing to guide them; and so the work went on\nagreeably for some hours, until I felt myself growing desperately\nhungry. Sitting down on the beam of the plow, I opened my basket and\ndiscussed the homely fare with a keen appetite.\n\nAfter finishing the food I resumed work again, but not as cheerfully as\nat first: I began to feel a little stiff and tired, and the immense\nquantity of mold adhering to my boots made it heavy walking; moreover,\nthe novelty had now worn off. The horses also did not work as smoothly\nas at the commencement: they seemed to have something on their minds,\nfor at the end of every furrow they would turn and stare at me in the\nmost exasperating manner.\n\n\"Phew!\" I ejaculated, as I stood wiping the honest sweat from my face\nwith my moldy, ancient, and extremely dirty pocket-handkerchief. \"Three\nhundred and sixty-four days of this sort of thing is a rather long price\nto pay for a suit of clothes.\"\n\nWhile standing there, I saw an animal coming swiftly towards me from the\ndirection of the forest, bounding along over the earth with a speed like\nthat of a greyhound--a huge, fierce-looking brute; and when close to me,\nI felt convinced that it was an animal of the same kind as the one I had\nseen during the night. Before I had made up my mind what to do, he was\nwithin a few yards of me, and then, coming to a sudden halt, he sat down\non his haunches, and gravely watched me. Calling to mind some things I\nhad heard about the terrifying effect of the human eye on royal tigers\nand other savage beasts, I gazed steadily at him, and then almost lost\nmy fear in admiration of his beauty. He was taller than a boarhound, but\nslender in figure, with keen, fox-like features, and very large, erect\nears; his coat was silvery-gray, and long; there were two black spots\nabove his eyes; and the feet, muzzle, ear-tips, and end of the bushy\ntail were also velvet-black. After watching me quietly for two or three\nminutes, he started up, and, much to my relief, trotted away towards the\nwood; but after going about fifty yards he looked back, and seeing me\nstill gazing after him, wheeled round and rushed at me, and when quite\nclose uttered a sound like a ringing, metallic yelp, after which he once\nmore bounded away, and disappeared from sight.\n\nThe horses now turned round, and, deliberately walking up to me, stood\nstill, in spite of all I could do to make them continue the work. After\nwaiting a while they proceeded to wriggle themselves out of the ropes,\nand galloped off, loudly neighing to each other, and flinging up their\ndisdainful heels so as to send a shower of dirt over me. Left alone in\nthis unceremonious fashion, I presently began to think that they knew\nmore about the work than I did, and that, finding me indisposed to\nrelease them at the proper moment, they had taken the matter into their\nown hands, or hoofs rather. A little more pondering, and I also came to\nthe conclusion that the singular wolf-like animal was only one of the\nhouse-dogs; that he had visited me in the night to remind me that I was\nsleeping with the door open, and had come now to insist on a suspension\nof work.\n\nGlad at having discovered all these things without displaying my\nignorance by asking questions, I took up my basket and started home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nWhen I arrived at the house I was met by the young man who had set me\nthe morning's task; but he was taciturn now, and wore a cold, estranged\nlook, which seemed to portend trouble. He at once led me to a part of\nthe house at a distance from the hall, and into a large apartment I now\nsaw for the first time. In a few moments the master of the house,\nfollowed by most of the other inmates, also entered, and on the faces of\nall of them I noticed the same cold, offended look.\n\n\"The dickens take my luck!\" said I to myself, beginning to feel\nextremely uncomfortable. \"I suppose I have offended against the laws and\ncustoms by working the horses too long.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" said the old man, advancing to the table, and depositing\nthereon a large volume he had brought with him, \"come here, and read to\nme in this book.\"\n\nAdvancing to the table, I saw that it was written in the same minute,\nHebrew-like characters of the folio I had examined on the previous\nevening. \"I cannot read it; I do not understand the letters,\" I said,\nfeeling some shame at having thus publicly to confess my ignorance.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, bending on me a look of the utmost severity, \"there is\nindeed little more to be said. Nevertheless, we take into account the\nconfused state of your intellect yesterday, and judge you leniently; and\nlet us hope that the pangs of an outraged conscience will be more\npainful to you than the light punishment I am about to inflict for so\ndestestable a crime.\"\n\nI now concluded that I had offended by squeezing Yoletta's hand, and had\nbeen told to read from the book merely to make myself acquainted with\nthe pains and penalties attendant on such an indiscretion, for to call\nit a \"detestable crime\" seemed to me a very great abuse of language.\n\n\"If I have offended,\" was my answer, delivered with little humility, \"I\ncan only plead my ignorance of the customs of the house.\"\n\n\"No man,\" he returned, with increased severity, \"is so ignorant as not\nto know right from wrong. Had the matter come to my knowledge sooner, I\nshould have said: Depart from us, for your continued presence in the\nhouse offends us; but we have made a compact with you, and, until the\nyear expires, we must suffer you. For the space of sixty days you must\ndwell apart from us, never leaving the room, where each day a task will\nbe assigned to you, and subsisting on bread and water only. Let us hope\nthat in this period of solitude and silence you will sufficiently repent\nyour crime, and rejoin us afterwards with a changed heart; for all\noffenses may be forgiven a man, but it is impossible to forgive a lie.\"\n\n\"A lie!\" I exclaimed in amazement. \"I have told no lie!\"\n\n\"This,\" said he, with an access of wrath, \"is an aggravation of your\nformer offense. It is even a worse offense than the first, and must be\ndealt with separately--when the sixty days have expired.\"\n\n\"Are you, then, going to condemn me without hearing me speak, or telling\nme anything about it? What lie have I told?\"\n\nAfter a pause, during which he closely scrutinized my face, he said,\npointing to the open page before him: \"Yesterday, in answer to my\nquestion, you told me that you could read. Last evening you made a\ncontrary statement to Yoletta; and now here is the book, and you confess\nthat you cannot read it.\"\n\n\"But that is easily explained,\" said I, immensely relieved, for I\ncertainly had felt a little guilty about the hand-squeezing performance,\nalthough it was not a very serious matter. \"I can read the books of my\nown country, and naturally concluded that your books were written in the\nsame kind of letters; but last evening I discovered that it was not so.\nYou have already seen the letters of my country on the coins I showed\nyou last evening.\"\n\nAnd here I again pulled out my pocket-book, and emptied the contents on\nthe table.\n\nHe began to pick up the sovereigns one by one to examine them.\nMeanwhile, finding my beautiful black and gold stylograph pen inserted\nin the book, I thought I could not do better than to show him how I\nwrote. Fortunately, the fluid in it had not become dry. Tearing a blank\npage from my book I hastily scribbled a few lines, and handed the paper\nto him, saying: \"This is how I write.\"\n\nHe began studying the paper, but his eyes, I perceived, wandered often\nto the stylograph pen in my hand.\n\nPresently he remarked: \"This writing, or these marks you have made on\nthe paper, are not the same as the letters on the gold.\"\n\nI took the paper and proceeded to copy the sentence I had written, but\nin printing letters, beneath it, then returned it to him.\n\nHe examined it again, and, after comparing my letters with those on the\nsovereigns, said: \"Pray tell me, now, what you have written here, and\nexplain why you write in two different ways?\"\n\nI told him, as well as I could, why letters of one form were used to\nstamp on gold and other substances, and of a different form for writing.\nThen, with a modest blush, I read the words of the sentence: \"In\ndifferent parts of the world men have different customs, and write\ndifferent letters; but alike to all men in all places, a lie is\nhateful.\"\n\n\"Smith,\" he said, addressing me in an impressive manner, but happily not\nto charge me with a third and bigger lie, \"I have lived long in the\nworld, and the knowledge others possess concerning it is mine also. It\nis common knowledge that in the hotter and colder regions men are\ncompelled to live differently, owing to the conditions they are placed\nin; but we know that everywhere they have the same law of right and\nwrong inscribed on the heart, and, as you have said, hate a lie; also\nthat they all speak the same language; and until this moment I also\nbelieved that they wrote in similar characters. You, however, have now\nsucceeded in convincing me that this is not the case; that in some\nobscure valley, cut off from all intercourse by inaccessible mountains,\nor in some small, unknown island of the sea, a people may exist--ah, did\nyou not tell me that you came from an island?\"\n\n\"Yes, my home was on an island,\" I answered.\n\n\"So I imagined. An island of which no report has ever reached us, where\nthe people, isolated from their fellows, have in the course of many\ncenturies changed their customs--even their manner of writing. Although\nI had seen these gold pieces I did not understand, or did not realize,\nthat such a human family existed: now I am persuaded of it, and as I\nalone am to blame for having brought this charge against you, I must now\nask your forgiveness. We rejoice at your innocence, and hope with\nincreased love to atone for our injustice. My son,\" he concluded,\nplacing a hand on my shoulder, \"I am now deeply in your debt.\"\n\n\"I am glad it has ended so happily,\" I replied, wondering whether his\nbeing in my debt would increase my chances with Yoletta or not.\n\nSeeing him again directing curious glances at the stylograph, which I\nwas turning about in my fingers, I offered it to him.\n\nHe examined it with interest.\n\n\"I have only been waiting for an opportunity,\" he said, \"to look closely\nat this wonderful contrivance, for I had perceived that your writing was\nnot made with a pencil, but with a fluid. It is black polished stone,\nbeautifully fashioned and encircled with gold bands, and contains the\nwriting-fluid within itself. This surprises me as much as anything you\nhave told me.\"\n\n\"Allow me to make you a present of it,\" said I, seeing him so taken with\nit.\n\n\"No, not so,\" he returned. \"But I should greatly like to possess it, and\nwill keep it if I may bestow in return something you desire.\"\n\nYoletta's hand was really the only thing in life I desired, but it was\ntoo early to speak yet, as I knew nothing about their matrimonial\nusages--not even whether or not the lady's consent was necessary to a\ncompact of the kind. I therefore made a more modest request. \"There is\none thing I greatly desire,\" I said. \"I am very anxious to be able to\nread in your books, and shall consider myself more than compensated if\nyou will permit Yoletta to teach me.\"\n\n\"She shall teach you in any case, my son,\" he returned. \"That, and much\nmore, is already owning to you.\"\n\n\"There is nothing else I desire,\" said I. \"Pray keep the pen and make me\nhappy.\"\n\nAnd thus ended a disagreeable matter.\n\nThe cloud having blown over, we all repaired to the supper-room, and\nnothing could exceed our happiness as we sat at meat--or vegetables. Not\nfeeling so ravenously hungry as on the previous evening, and, moreover,\nseeing them all in so lively a mood, I did not hesitate to join in the\nconversation: nor did I succeed so very badly, considering the\nstrangeness of it all; for like the bee that has been much hindered at\nhis flowery work by geometric webs, I began to acquire some skill in\npushing my way gracefully through the tangling meshes of thought and\nphrases that were new to me.\n\nThe afternoon's experiences had certainly been remarkable--a strange\nmixture of pain and pleasure, not blending into homogeneous gray, but\nresembling rather a bright embroidery on a dark, somber ground; and of\nthese surprising contrasts I was destined to have more that same\nevening.\n\nWe were again assembled in the great room, the venerable father\nreclining at his ease on his throne-like couch near the brass globes,\nwhile the others pursued their various occupations as on the former\nevening. Not being able to get near Yoletta, and having nothing to do, I\nsettled myself comfortably in one of the spacious seats, and gave up my\nmind to pleasant dreams. At length, to my surprise, the father, who had\nbeen regarding me for some time, said: \"Will you lead, my son?\"\n\nI started up, turning very red in the face, for I did not wish to\ntrouble him with questions, yet was at a loss to know what he meant by\nleading. I thought of several things--whist, evening prayers, dancing,\netc.; but being still in doubt, I was compelled to ask him to explain.\n\n\"Will you lead the singing?\" he returned, looking a little surprised.\n\n\"Oh yes, with pleasure,\" said I. There being no music about, and no\npiano, I concluded naturally that my friends amused themselves with solo\nsongs without accompaniment of an evening, and having a good tenor voice\nI was not unwilling to lead off with a song. Clearing my rusty throat\nwith a _ghrr-ghrr-hram_ which made them all jump, I launched forth\nwith the \"Vicar of Bray\"--a grand old song and a great favorite of mine.\nThey all started when I commenced, exchanging glances, and casting\nastonished looks towards me; but it was getting so dusky in the room\nthat I could not feel sure that my eyes were not deceiving me. Presently\nsome that were near me began retiring to distant seats, and this\ndistressed me so that it made me hoarse, and my singing became very bad\nindeed; but still I thought it best to go bravely on to the end.\nSuddenly the old gentleman, who had been staring wildly at me for some\ntime, drew up his long yellow robe and wrapped it round his face and\nhead. I glanced at Yoletta, sitting at some distance, and saw that she\nwas holding her hands pressed to her ears.\n\nI thought it about time to leave off then, and stopping abruptly in the\nmiddle of the fourth stanza I sat down, feeling extremely hot and\nuncomfortable. I was almost choking, and unable to utter a word. But\nthere was no word for me to utter: it was, of course, for them to thank\nme for singing, or to say something; but not a word was spoken. Yoletta\ndropped her hands and resumed her work, while the old man slowly emerged\nwith a somewhat frightened look from the wrappings; and then the long\ndead silence becoming unendurable, I remarked that I feared my singing\nwas not to their taste. No reply was made; only the father, putting out\none of his hands, touched a handle or key near him, whereupon one of the\nbrass globes began slowly revolving. A low murmur of sound arose, and\nseemed to pass like a wave through the room, dying away in the distance,\nsoon to be succeeded by another, and then another, each marked by an\nincrease of power; and often as this solemn sound died away, faint\nflute-like notes were heard as if approaching, but still at a great\ndistance, and in the ensuing wave of sound from the great globes they\nwould cease to be distinguishable. Still the mysterious coming sounds\ncontinued at intervals to grow louder and clearer, joined by other tones\nas they progressed, now altogether bursting out in joyous chorus, then\none purest liquid note soaring bird-like alone, but whether from voices\nor wind-instruments I was unable to tell, until the whole air about me\nwas filled and palpitating with the strange, exquisite harmony, which\npassed onwards, the tones growing fewer and fainter by degrees until\nthey almost died out of hearing in the opposite direction. That all were\nnow taking part in the performance I became convinced by watching in\nturn different individuals, some of them having small, curiously-shaped\ninstruments in their hands, but there was a blending of voices and a\nsomething like ventriloquism in the tones which made it impossible to\ndistinguish the notes of any one person. Deeper, more sonorous tones now\nissued from the revolving globes, sometimes resembling in character the\nvox humana of an organ, and every time they rose to a certain pitch\nthere were responsive sounds--not certainly from any of the\nperformers--low, tremulous, and Aeolian in character, wandering over the\nentire room, as if walls and ceiling were honey-combed with sensitive\nmusical cells, answering to the deeper vibrations. These floating aerial\nsounds also answered to the higher notes of some of the female singers,\nresembling soprano voices, brightened and spiritualized in a wonderful\ndegree; and then the wide room would be filled with a mist, as it were,\nof this floating, formless melody, which seemed to come from invisible\nharpers hovering in the shadows above.\n\nLying back on my couch, listening with closed eyes to this mysterious,\nsoul-stirring concert, I was affected to tears, and almost feared that I\nhad been snatched away into some supra-mundane region inhabited by\nbeings of an angelic or half-angelic order--feared, I say, for, with\nthis new love in my heart, no elysium or starry abode could compare with\nthis green earth for a dwellingplace. But when I remembered my own\nbrutal bull of Bashan performance, my face, there in the dark, was on\nfire with shame; and I cursed the ignorant, presumptuous folly I had\nbeen guilty of in roaring out that abominable \"Vicar of Bray\" ballad,\nwhich had now become as hateful to me as my trousers or boots. The\ncomposer of that song, the writer of the words, and its subject, the\ndouble-faced Vicar himself, presented themselves to my mind as the three\nmost damnable beings that had ever existed. \"The devil take my luck!\" I\nmuttered, grinding my teeth with impotent anger; for it seemed such hard\nlines, just when I had succeeded in getting into favor, to go and spoil\nit all in that unhappy way. Now that I had become acquainted with their\nstyle of singing, the supposed fib, about which there had been such a\npother, seemed a very venial offense compared with my attempt to lead\nthe singing. Nevertheless, when the concert was over, not a word was\nsaid on the subject by any one, though I had quite expected to be taken\nat once to the magisterial chamber to hear some dreadful sentence passed\non me; and when, before retiring, anxious to propitiate my host, I began\nto express regret for having inflicted pain on them by attempting to\nsing, the venerable gentleman raised his hands deprecatingly, and begged\nme to say no more about it, for painful subjects were best forgotten.\n\"No doubt,\" he kindly added, \"when you were lying there buried among the\nhills, you swallowed a large amount of earth and gravel in your efforts\nto breathe, and have not yet freed your lungs from it.\"\n\nThis was the most charitable view he could take of the matter, and I was\nthankful that no worse result followed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nAt length the joyful day arrived when I was to cease, in outward\nappearance at all events, to be an alien; for returning at noon from the\nfields, on entering my cell I beheld my beautiful new garments--two\ncomplete suits, besides underwear: one, the most soberly colored,\nintended only for working hours; but the second, which was for the\nhouse, claimed my first attention. Trembling with eagerness, I flung off\nthe old tweeds, the cracked boots, and other vestiges of a civilization\nwhich they had perhaps survived, and soon found that I had been measured\nwith faultless accuracy; for everything, down to the shoes, fitted to\nperfection. Green was the prevailing or ground tint--a soft sap green;\nthe pattern on it, which was very beautiful, being a somewhat obscure\nred, inclining to purple. My delight culminated when I drew on the hose,\nwhich had, like those worn by the others, a curious design, evidently\nborrowed from the skin of some kind of snake. The ground color was light\ngreen, almost citron yellow, in fact, and the pattern a bright maroon\nred, with bronze reflections.\n\nI had no sooner arrayed myself than, with a flushed face and palpitating\nheart, I flew to exhibit myself to my friends, and found them assembled\nand waiting to see and admire the result of their work. The pleasure I\nsaw reflected in their transparent faces increased my happiness a\nhundredfold, and I quite astonished them with the torrent of eloquence\nin which I expressed my overflowing gratitude.\n\n\"Now, tell me one secret,\" I exclaimed, when the excitement began to\nabate a little. \"Why is green the principal color in my clothes, when no\nother person in the house wears more than a very little of it?\"\n\nI had no sooner spoken than I heartily wished that I had held my peace;\nfor it all at once occurred to me that green was perhaps the color for\nan alien or mere hireling, in which light they perhaps regarded me.\n\n\"Oh, Smith, can you not guess so simple a thing?\" said Edra, placing her\nwhite hands on my shoulders and smiling straight into my face.\n\nHow beautiful she looked, standing there with her eyes so near to mine!\n\"Tell me why, Edra?\" I said, still with a lingering apprehension.\n\n\"Why, look at the color of my eyes and skin--would this green tint be\nsuitable for me to wear?\"\n\n\"Oh, is that the reason!\" cried I, immensely relieved. \"I think, Edra,\nyou would look very beautiful in any color that is on the earth, or in\nthe rainbow above the earth. But am I so different from you all?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, quite different--have you never looked at yourself? Your skin\nis whiter and redder, and your hair has a very different color. It will\nlook better when it grows long, I think. And your eyes--do you know that\nthey never change! for when we look at you closely they are still\nblue-gray, and not green.\"\n\n\"No; I wish they were,\" said I. \"Now I shall value my clothes a hundred\ntimes more, since you have taken so much pains to make them--well, what\nshall I say?--harmonize, I suppose, with the peculiar color of my mug.\nDash it all, I'm blundering again! I mean--I mean--don't you know----\"\n\nEdra laughed and gave it up. Then we all laughed; for now evidently my\nblundering did not so much matter, since I had shed my outer integument,\nand come forth like a snake (with a divided tail) in a brand new skin.\n\nPresently I missed Yoletta from the room, and desiring above all things\nto have some word of congratulation from her lips, I went off to seek\nher. She was standing under the portico waiting for me. \"Come,\" she\nsaid, and proceeded to lead me into the music-room, where we sat down on\none of the couches close to the dais; there she produced some large\nwhite tablets, and red chalk pencils or crayons.\n\n\"Now, Smith, I am going to begin teaching you,\" said she, with the grave\nair of a young schoolmistress; \"and every afternoon, when your work is\ndone, you must come to me here.\"\n\n\"I hope I am very stupid, and that it will take me a long time to\nlearn,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh\"--she laughed--\"do you think it will be so pleasant sitting by me\nhere? I am glad you think that; but if you prefer me for a teacher you\nmust not try to be stupid, because if you do I shall ask some one else\nto take my place.\"\n\n\"Would you really do that, Yoletta?\"\n\n\"Yes. Shall I tell you why? Because I have a quick, impatient temper.\nEverything wrong I have ever done, for which I have been punished, has\nbeen through my hasty temper.\"\n\n\"And have you ever undergone that sad punishment of being shut up by\nyourself for many days, Yoletta?\"\n\n\"Yes, often; for what other punishment is there? But oh, I hope it will\nnever happen again, because I think--I know that I suffer more than any\none can imagine. To tread on the grass, to feel the sun and wind on my\nface, to see the earth and sky and animals--this is like life to me; and\nwhen I am shut up alone, every day seems--oh, a year at least!\" She did\nnot know how much dearer this confession of one little human weakness\nmade her seem to me. \"Come, let us begin,\" she said. \"I waited for your\nnew clothes to be finished, and we must make up for lost time.\"\n\n\"But do you know, Yoletta, that you have not said anything about them?\nDo I look nice; and will you like me any better now?\"\n\n\"Yes, much better. You were a poor caterpillar before; I liked you a\nlittle because I knew what a pretty butterfly you would be in time. I\nhelped to make your wings. Now, listen.\"\n\nFor two hours she taught me, making her red letters or marks, which I\ncopied on my tablet, and explaining them to me; and at the conclusion of\nthe lesson, I had got a general idea that the writing was to a great\nextent phonographic, and that I was in for rather a tough job.\n\n\"Do you think that you will be able to teach me to sing also?\" I asked,\nwhen she had put the tablets aside.\n\nThe memory of that miserable failure, when I \"had led the singing,\" was\na constant sore in my mind. I had begun to think that I had not done\nmyself justice on that memorable occasion, and the desire to make\nanother trial under more favorable circumstances was very strong in me.\n\nShe looked a little startled at my question, but said nothing.\n\n\"I know now,\" I continued pleadingly, \"that you all sing softly. If you\nwill only consent to try me once I promise to stick like cobbler's\nwax--I beg your pardon, I mean I will endeavor to adhere to the morendo\nand perdendosi style--don't you know? What am I saying! But I promise\nyou, Yoletta, I shan't frighten you, if you will only let me try and\nsing to you once.\"\n\nShe turned from me with a somewhat clouded expression of face, and\nwalked with slow steps to the dais, and placing her hands on the keys,\ncaused two of the small globes to revolve, sending soft waves of sound\nthrough the room.\n\nI advanced towards her, but she raised her hand apprehensively. \"No, no,\nno; stand there,\" she said, \"and sing low.\"\n\nIt was hard to see her troubled face and obey, but I was not going to\nbellow at her like a bull, and I had set my heart on this trial. For the\nlast three days, while working in the fields, I had been incessantly\npracticing my dear old master Campana's exquisite _M'appar sulla\ntomba_, the only melody I happened to know which had any resemblance\nto their divine music. To my surprise she seemed to play as I sang a\nsuitable accompaniment on the globes, which aided and encouraged me,\nand, although singing in a subdued tone, I felt that I had never sung so\nwell before. When I finished, I quite expected some word of praise, or\nto be asked why I had not sung this melody on that unhappy evening when\nI was asked to lead; but she spoke no word.\n\n\"Will you sing something now?\" I said.\n\n\"Not now--this evening,\" she replied absently, slowly walking across the\nfloor with eyes cast down.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, Yoletta, that you look so serious?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she returned, a little impatiently.\n\n\"You look very solemn about nothing, then. But you have not said one\nword about my singing--did you not like it?\"\n\n\"Your singing? Oh no! It was a pleasant-tasting little kernel in a very\nrough rind--I should like one without the other.\"\n\n\"You talk in riddles, Yoletta; but I'm afraid the answers to them would\nnot sound very flattering to me. But if you would like to know the song\nI shall be only too glad to teach it to you. The words are in Italian,\nbut I can translate them.\"\n\n\"The words?\" she said absently.\n\n\"The words of the song,\" I said.\n\n\"I do not know what you mean by the words of a song. Do not speak to me\nnow, Smith.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said I, thinking it all very strange, and sitting down\nI divided my attention between my beautiful hose and Yoletta, still\nslowly pacing the floor with that absent look on her face.\n\nAt length the curious mood changed, but I did not venture to talk any\nmore about music, and before very long we repaired to the eating-room,\nwhere, for the next two or three hours, we occupied ourselves very\nagreeably with those processes which, some new theorist informs us,\nconstitute our chief pleasure in life.\n\nThat evening I overheard a curious little dialogue. The father of the\nhouse, as I had now grown accustomed to call our head, after rising from\nhis seat, stood for a few minutes talking near me, while Yoletta, with\nher hand on his arm, waited for him to finish. When he had done\nspeaking, and turned to her, she said in a low voice, which I, however,\noverheard: \"Father, I shall lead to-night.\"\n\nHe put his hand on her head, and, looking down, studied her upturned\nface. \"Ah, my daughter,\" he said with a smile, \"shall I guess what has\ninspired you to-day? You have been listening to the passage birds. I\nalso heard them this morning passing in flocks. And you have been\nfollowing them in thought far away into those sun-bright lands where\nwinter never comes.\"\n\n\"No, father,\" she returned, \"I have only been a little way from home in\nthought--only to that spot where the grass has not yet grown to hide the\nashes and loose mold.\" He stooped and kissed her forehead, and then left\nthe room; and she, never noticing the hungry look with which I witnessed\nthe tender caress, also went away.\n\nThat some person was supposed to lead the singing every evening I knew,\nbut it was impossible for me ever to discover who the leader was; now,\nhowever, after overhearing this conversation, I knew that on this\nparticular occasion it would be Yoletta, and in spite of the very poor\nopinion she had expressed of my musical abilities, I was prepared to\nadmire the performance more than I had ever done before.\n\nIt commenced in the usual mysterious and indefinable manner; but after\na time, when it began to shape itself into melodies, the idea possessed\nme that I was listening to strains once familiar, but long unheard and\nforgotten. At length I discovered that this was Campana's music, only\nnot as I had ever heard it sung; for the melody of _M'appar sulla\ntomba_ had been so transmuted and etherealized, as it were, that the\ncomposer himself would have listened in wondering ecstasy to the\nmournful strains, which had passed through the alembic of their more\ndelicately organized minds. Listening, I remembered with an\nunaccountable feeling of sadness, that poor Campana had recently died in\nLondon; and almost at the same moment there came to me a remembrance of\nmy beloved mother, whose early death was my first great grief in\nboyhood. All the songs I had ever heard her sing came back to me,\nringing in my mind with a wonderful joy, but ever ending in a strange,\nfunereal sadness. And not only my mother, but many a dear one besides\nreturned \"in beauty from the dust\" appeared to be present--white-haired\nold men who had spoken treasured words to me in bygone years;\nschoolfellows and other boyish friends and companions; and men, too, in\nthe prime of life, of whose premature death in this or that far-off\nregion of the world-wide English empire I had heard from time to time.\nThey came back to me, until the whole room seemed filled with a pale,\nshadowy procession, moving past me to the sound of that mysterious\nmelody. Through all the evening it came back, in a hundred bewildering\ndisguises, filling me with a melancholy infinitely precious, which was\nyet almost more than my heart could bear. Again and yet again that\ndespairing _Ah-i-me_ fell like a long shuddering sob from the\nrevolving globes, and from voices far and near, to be taken up and borne\nyet further away by far-off, dying sounds, yet again responded to by\nnearer, clearer voices, in tones which seemed wrung \"from the depths of\nsome divine despair\"; then to pass away, but not wholly pass, for all\nthe hidden cells were stirred, and the vibrating air, like mysterious,\ninvisible hands, swept the suspended strings, until the exquisite bliss\nand pain of it made me tremble and shed tears, as I sat there in the\ndark, wondering, as men will wonder at such moments, what this tempest\nof the soul which music wakes in us can mean: whether it is merely a\ngrowth of this our earth-life, or a something added, a divine hunger of\nthe heart which is part of our immortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nIt seemed to me now that I had never really lived before so sweet was\nthis new life--so healthy, and free from care and regret. The old life,\nwhich I had lived in cities, was less in my thoughts on each succeeding\nday; it came to me now like the memory of a repulsive dream, which I was\nonly too glad to forget. How I had ever found that listless, worn-out,\nluxurious, do-nothing existence endurable, seemed a greater mystery\nevery morning, when I went forth to my appointed task in the fields or\nthe workhouse, so natural and so pleasant did it now seem to labor with\nmy own hands, and to eat my bread in the sweat of my face. If there was\none kind of work I preferred above all others, it was wood-cutting, and\nas a great deal of timber was required at this season, I was allowed to\nfollow my own inclination. In the forest, a couple of miles from the\nhouse, several tough old giants--chiefly oak, chestnut, elm, and\nbeech--had been marked out for destruction: in some cases because they\nhad been scorched and riven by lightnings, and were an eyesore; in\nothers, because time had robbed them of their glory, withering their\nlong, desolate arms, and bestowing on their crowns that lusterless,\nscanty foliage which has a mournful meaning, like the thin white hairs\non the bowed head of a very old man. At this distance from the house I\ncould freely indulge my propensity for singing, albeit in that coarser\ntone which had failed to win favor with my new friends.\n\nAmong the grand trees, out of earshot of them all, I could shout aloud\nto my heart's content, rejoicing in the boisterous old English ballads,\nwhich, like John Peele's view-hallo,\n\n  _\"Might awaken the dead\n  Or the fox from his lair in the morning.\"_\n\n\nMeanwhile, with the frantic energy of a Gladstone out of office, I plied\nmy ax, its echoing strokes making fit accompaniment to my strains, until\nfor many yards about me the ground was littered with white and yellow\nchips; then, exhausted with my efforts, I would sit down to rest and eat\nmy simple midday fare, to admire myself in my deep-green and chocolate\nworking-dress, and, above everything, to think and dream of Yoletta.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIn my walks to and from the forest I cast many a wistful look at a\nsolitary flat-topped hill, almost a mountain in height, which stood two\nor three miles from the house, north of it, on the other side of the\nriver. From its summit I felt sure that a very extensive view of the\nsurrounding country might be had, and I often wished to pay this hill a\nvisit. One afternoon, while taking my lesson in reading, I mentioned\nthis desire to Yoletta.\n\n\"Come, then, let us go there now,\" said she, laying the tablets aside.\n\nI joyfully agreed: I had never walked alone with her, nor, in fact, with\nher at all, since that first day when she had placed her hand in mine;\nand now we were so much nearer in heart to each other.\n\nShe led me to a point, half a mile from the house, where the stream\nrushed noisily over its stony bed and formed numerous deep channels\nbetween the rocks, and one could cross over by jumping from rock to\nrock. Yoletta led the way, leaping airily from stone to stone, while I,\nanxious to escape a wetting, followed her with caution; but when I was\nsafe over, and thought our delightful walk was about to begin, she\nsuddenly started off towards the hill at a swift pace, which quickly\nleft me far behind. Finding that I could not overtake her, I shouted to\nher to wait for me; then she stood still until I was within three or\nfour yards Of her, when off she fled like the wind once more. At length\nshe reached the foot of the hill, and sat down there until I joined her.\n\n\"For goodness sake, Yoletta, let us behave like rational beings and walk\nquietly,\" I was beginning, when away she went again, dancing up the\nmountain-side with a tireless energy that amazed as well as exasperated\nme. \"Wait for me just once more,\" I screamed after her; then, half-way\nup the side, she stopped and sat down on a stone.\n\n\"Now my chance has come,\" thought I, ready to make up for insufficient\nspeed and wind by superior cunning, which would make us equal. \"I will\ngo quietly up and catch her napping, and hold her fast by the arm until\nthe walk is finished. So far it has been nothing but a mad chase.\"\n\nSlowly I toiled on, and then, when I got near her and was just about to\nexecute my plan, she started nimbly away, with a merry laugh, and never\npaused again until the summit was reached. Thoroughly tired and beaten,\nI sat down to rest; but presently looking up I saw her at the top,\nstanding motionless on a stone, looking like a statue outlined against\nthe clear blue sky. Once more I got up and pressed on until I reached\nher, and then sank down on the grass, overcome with fatigue.\n\n\"When you ask me to walk again, Yoletta,\" I panted, \"I shall not move\nunless I have a rope round your waist to pull you back when you try to\nrush off in that mad fashion. You have knocked all the wind out of me;\nand yet I was in pretty good trim.\"\n\nShe laughed, and jumping to the ground, sat down at my side on the\ngrass.\n\nI caught her hand and held it tight. \"Now you shall not escape and run\naway again,\" said I.\n\n\"You may keep my hand,\" she replied; \"it has nothing to do up here.\"\n\n\"May I put it to some useful purpose--may I do what I like with it?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may,\" then she added with a smile: \"There is no thorn in it\nnow.\"\n\nI kissed it many times on the back, the palm, the wrist then bestowed a\nseparate caress on each finger-tip.\n\n\"Why do you kiss my hand?\" she asked.\n\n\"Do you not know--can you not guess? Because it is the sweetest thing I\ncan kiss, except one other thing. Shall I tell you----\"\n\n\"My face? And why do you not kiss that?\"\n\n\"Oh, may I?\" said I, and drawing her to me I kissed her soft cheek. \"May\nI kiss the other cheek now?\" I asked. She turned it to me, and when I\nhad kissed it rapturously, I gazed into her eyes, which looked back,\nbright and unabashed, into mine. \"I think--I think I made a slight\nmistake, Yoletta,\" I said. \"What I meant to ask was, will you let me\nkiss you where I like--on your chin, for instance, or just where I\nlike?\"\n\n\"Yes; but you are keeping me too long. Kiss me as many times as you\nlike, and then let us admire the prospect.\"\n\nI drew her closer and kissed her mouth, not once nor twice, but clinging\nto it with all the ardor of passion, as if my lips had become glued to\nhers.\n\nSuddenly she disengaged herself from me. \"Why do you kiss my mouth in\nthat violent way?\" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling, her cheeks\nflushed. \"You seem like some hungry animal that wanted to devour me.\"\n\nThat was, oddly enough, just how I felt. \"Do you not not know, sweetest,\nwhy I kiss you in that way? Because I love you.\"\n\n\"I know you do, Smith. I can understand and appreciate your love without\nhaving my lips bruised.\"\n\n\"And do you love me, Yoletta?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly--did you not know that?\"\n\n\"And is it not sweet to kiss when you love? Do you know what love is,\ndarling? Do you love me a thousand times more than any one else in the\nworld?\"\n\n\"How extravagantly you talk!\" she replied. \"What strange things you\nsay!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, because love is strange--the strangest, sweetest thing in\nlife. It comes once only to the heart, and the one person loved is\ninfinitely more than all others. Do you not understand that?\"\n\n\"Oh no; what do you mean, Smith?\"\n\n\"Is there any other person dearer to your heart than I am?\"\n\n\"I love every one in the house, some more than others. Those that are\nclosely related to me I love most.\"\n\n\"Oh, please say no more! You love your people with one kind of love, but\nme with a different love--is it not so?\"\n\n\"There is only one kind of love,\" said she.\n\n\"Ah, you say that because you are a child yet, and do not know. You are\neven younger than I thought, perhaps. How old are you, dear?\"\n\n\"Thirty-one years old,\" she replied, with the utmost gravity.\n\n\"Oh, Yoletta, what an awful cram! I mean--oh, I beg your pardon for\nbeing so rude! But--but don't you think you can draw it mild?\nThirty-one--what a joke! Why, I'm an old fellow compared with you, and\nI'm not twenty-two yet. Do tell me what you mean, Yoletta?\"\n\nShe was not listening to me, I saw: she had risen from the grass and\nseated herself again on the stone. For only answer to my question she\npointed to the west with her hand, saying: \"Look there, Smith.\"\n\nI stood up and looked. The sun was near the horizon now, and partially\nconcealed by low clouds, which were beginning to form--gray, and tinged\nwith purple and red; but their misty edges burned with an intense yellow\nflame. Above, the sky was clear as blue glass, barred with pale-yellow\nrays, shot forth by the sinking sun, and resembling the spokes of an\nimmense celestial wheel reaching to the zenith. The billowy earth, with\nits forests in deep green and many-colored, autumnal foliage, stretched\nfar before us, here in shadow, and there flushed with rich light; while\nthe mountain range, looming near and stupendous on our right, had\nchanged its color from dark blue to violet.\n\nThe doubts and fears agitating my heart made me indifferent to the\nsurpassing beauty of the scene: I turned impatiently from it to gaze\nagain on her graceful figure, girlish still in its slim proportions; but\nher face, flushed with sunlight, and crowned with its dark, shining\nhair, seemed to me like the face of one of the immortals. The expression\nof rapt devotion on it made me silent, for it seemed as if she too had\nbeen touched by nature's magic, like earth and sky, and been\ntransfigured; and waiting for the mood to pass, I stood by her side,\nresting my hand on her knee. By-and-by she looked down and smiled, and\nthen I returned to the subject of her age.\n\n\"Surely, Yoletta,\" said I, \"you were only poking fun at me--I mean,\namusing yourself at my expense. You can't possibly be more than about\nfifteen, or sixteen at the very outside.\"\n\nShe smiled again and shook her head.\n\n\"Oh, I know, I can solve the riddle now. Your years are different, of\ncourse, like everything else in this latitude. A month is called a year\nwith you, and that would make you, let me see--how much is twelve times\nthirty-one? Oh, hang it, nearly five hundred, I should think. Why am I\nsuch a duffer at mental arithmetic! It is just the contrary--how many\ntwelves in thirty-one? About two and a half in round numbers, and that's\nabsurd, as you are not a baby. Oh, I have it: your seasons are called\nyears, of course--why didn't I see it before! No, that would make you\nonly seven and a half. Ah, yes, I see it now: a year means two years, or\ntwo of your years--summer and winter--mean a year; and that just makes\nyou sixteen, exactly what I had imagined. Is it not so, Yoletta?\"\n\n\"I do not know what you are talking about, Smith; and I am not\nlistening.\"\n\n\"Well, listen for one moment, and tell me how long does a year last?\"\n\n\"It lasts from the time the leaves fall in the autumn until they fall\nagain; and it lasts from the time the swallows come in spring until they\ncome again.\"\n\n\"And seriously, honestly, you are thirty-one years old?\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you so? Yes, I am thirty-one years old.\"\n\n\"Well, I never heard anything to equal this! Good heavens, what does it\nmean? I know it is awfully rude to inquire a lady's age, but what am I\nto do? Will you kindly tell me Edra's age?\"\n\n\"Edra? I forget. Oh yes; she is sixty-three.\"\n\n\"Sixty-three! I'll be shot if she's a day more than twenty-eight! Idiot\nthat I am, why can't I keep calm! But, Yoletta, how you distress me! It\nalmost frightens me to ask another question, but do tell me how old your\nfather is?\"\n\n\"He is nearly two hundred years old--a hundred and ninety-eight, I\nthink,\" she replied.\n\n\"Heavens on earth--I shall go stark, staring mad!\" But I could say no\nmore; leaving her side I sat down on a low stone at some distance, with\na stunned feeling in my brain, and something like despair in my heart.\nThat she had told me the truth I could no longer doubt for one moment:\nit was impossible for her crystal nature to be anything but truthful.\nThe number of her years mattered nothing to me; the virgin sweetness of\ngirlhood was on her lips, the freshness and glory of early youth on her\nforehead; the misery was that she had lived thirty-one years in the\nworld and did not understand the words I had spoken to her--did not know\nwhat love, or passion, was! Would it always be so--would my heart\nconsume itself to ashes, and kindle no fire in hers?\n\nThen, as I sat there, filled with these despairing thoughts, she came\ndown from her perch, and, dropping on her knees before me, put her arms\nabout my neck and gazed steadily into my face. \"Why are you troubled,\nSmith-have I said anything to hurt you?\" said she. \"And do you not know\nthat you have offended me?\"\n\n\"Have I? Tell me how, dearest Yoletta.\"\n\n\"By asking questions, and saying wild, meaningless things while I sat\nthere watching the setting sun. It troubled me and spoiled my pleasure;\nbut I will forgive you, Smith, because I love you. Do you not think I\nlove you enough? You are very dear to me--dearer every day.\" And drawing\ndown my face she kissed my lips.\n\n\"Darling, you make me happy again,\" I returned, \"for if your love\nincreases every day, the time will perhaps come when you will understand\nme, and be all I wish to me.\"\n\n\"What is it that you wish?\" she questioned.\n\n\"That you should be mine--mine alone, wholly mine--and give yourself to\nme, body and soul.\"\n\nShe continued gazing up into my eyes. \"In a sense we do, I suppose, give\nourselves, body and soul, to those we love,\" she said. \"And if you are\nnot yet satisfied that I have given myself to you in that way, you must\nwait patiently, saying and doing nothing willfully to alienate my heart,\nuntil the time arrives when my love will be equal to your desire. Come,\"\nshe added, and, rising, pulled me up by the hand.\n\nSilently, and somewhat pensively, we started hand in hand on our walk\ndown the hill. Presently she dropped on her knees, and opening the grass\nwith her hands, displayed a small, slender bud, on a round, smooth stem,\nspringing without leaves from the soil. \"Do you see!\" she said, looking\nup at me with a bright smile.\n\n\"Yes, dear, I see a bud; but I do not know anything more about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Smith, do you not know that it is a rainbow lily!\" And rising, she\ntook my hand and walked on again.\n\n\"What is the rainbow lily?\"\n\n\"By-and-by, in a few days, it will be in fullest bloom, and the earth\nwill be covered with its glory.\"\n\n\"It is so late in the season, Yoletta! Spring is the time to see the\nearth covered with the glory of flowers.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to equal the rainbow lily, which comes when most\nflowers are dead, or have their bright colors tarnished. Have you lived\nin the moon, Smith, that I have to tell you these things?\"\n\n\"No, dear, but in that island where all things, including flowers, were\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; tell me about the island.\"\n\nNow \"that island\" was an unfortunate subject, and I was not prepared to\nbreak the resolution I had made of prudently holding my tongue about its\npeculiar institutions. \"How can I tell you?--how could you imagine it if\nI were to tell you?\" I said, evading the question. \"You have seen the\nheavens black with tempests, and have felt the lightnings blinding your\neyes, and have heard the crash of the thunder: could you imagine all\nthat if you had never witnessed it, and I described it to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then it would be useless to tell you. And now tell me about the rainbow\nlilies, for I am a great lover of flowers.\"\n\n\"Are you? Is it strange you should have a taste common to all human\nbeings?\" she returned with a pretty smile. \"But it is easier to ask\nquestions than to answer them. If you had never seen the sun setting in\nglory, or the midnight sky shining with myriads of stars, could you\nimagine these things if I described them to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That word is an echo, Smith. You must wait for the earth to bring forth\nher rainbow lilies, and the heart its love.\"\n\n\"With or without flowers, the world is a paradise to me, with you at my\nside, Yoletta. Ah, if you will be my Eve! How sweet it is to walk hand\nin hand with you in the twilight; but it was not so nice when you were\nscuttling from me like a wild rabbit. I'm glad to find that you do walk\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"Yes, sometimes--on solemn occasions.\"\n\n\"Yes? Tell me about these solemn occasions.\"\n\n\"This is not one of them,\" she replied, suddenly withdrawing her hand\nfrom mine; then with a ringing laugh, she sped from me, bounding down\nthe hill-side with the speed and grace of a gazelle.\n\nI instantly gave chase; but it was a very vain chase, although I put\nforth all my powers. Occasionally she would drop on her knees to admire\nsome wild flower, or search for a lily bud; and whenever she came to a\nlarge stone, she would spring on to it, and stand for some time\nmotionless, gazing at the rich hues of the afterglow; but always at my\napproach she would spring lightly away, escaping from me as easily as a\nwild bird. Tired with running, I at last gave up the hunt, and walked\nsoberly home by myself, wondering whether that conversation on the\nsummit of the hill, and all the curious information I had gathered from\nit, should make me the most miserable or the most happy being upon\nearth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nThe question whether I had reason to feel happy or the reverse still\noccupied me after going to bed, and kept me awake far into the night. I\nput it to myself in a variety of ways, concentrating my faculties on it;\nbut the result still remained doubtful. Mine was a curious position for\na man to be in; for here was I, very much in love with Yoletta, who said\nthat her age was thirty-one, and yet who knew of only one kind of\nlove--that sisterly affection which she gave me so unstintingly. Of\ncourse I was surrounded with mysteries, being in the house but not of\nit, to the manner born; and I had already arrived at the conclusion that\nthese mysteries could only be known to me through reading, once that\naccomplishment was mine. For it seemed rather a dangerous thing to ask\nquestions, since the most innocent interrogatory might be taken as an\noffense, only to be expiated by solitary confinement and a\nbread-and-water diet; or, if not punishable in that way, it would\nprobably be regarded as a result of the supposed collision of my head\nwith a stone. To be reticent, observant, and studious was a safe plan;\nthis had served to make me diligent and attentive with my lessons, and\nmy gentle teacher had been much pleased with the progress I had made,\neven in a few days. Her words on the hill had now, however, filled me\nwith anxiety, and I wanted to go a little below the surface of this\nstrange system of life. Why was this large family--twenty-two members\npresent, besides some absent pilgrims, as they are called--composed only\nof adults? Again, more curious still, why was the father of the house\nadorned with a majestic beard, while the other men, of various ages, had\nsmooth faces, or, at any rate, nothing more than a slight down on the\nupper lip and cheeks? It was plain that they never shaved. And were\nthese people all really brothers and sisters? So far, I had been unable,\neven with the most jealous watching, to detect anything like love-making\nor flirting; they all treated each other, as Yoletta treated me, with\nkindness and affection, and nothing more. And if the head of the house\nwas in fact the father of them all--since in two centuries a man might\nhave an indefinite number of children--who was the mother or mothers? I\nwas never good at guessing, but the result of my cogitations was one\nhappy idea--to ask Yoletta whether she had a living mother or not? She\nwas my teacher, my friend and guardian in the house, and if it should\nturn out that the question was an unfortunate one, an offense, she would\nbe readier to forgive than another.\n\nAccordingly, next day, as soon as we were alone together I put the\nquestion to her, although not without a nervous qualm.\n\nShe looked at me with the greatest surprise. \"Do you mean to say,\" she\nanswered, \"that you do not know I have a mother--that there is a mother\nof the house?\"\n\n\"How should I know, Yoletta?\" I returned. \"I have not heard you address\nany one as mother; besides, how is one to know anything in a strange\nplace unless he is told?\"\n\n\"How strange, then, that you never asked till now! There is a mother of\nthe house--the mother of us all, of you since you were made one of us;\nand it happens, too, that I am her daughter--her only child. You have\nnot seen her because you have never asked to be taken to her; and she is\nnot among us because of her illness. For very long she has been\nafflicted with a malady from which she cannot recover, and for a whole\nyear she has not left the Mother's Room.\"\n\nShe spoke with eyes cast down, in a low and very sad voice. It was only\ntoo plain now that in my ignorance I had been guilty of a grave breach\nof the etiquette or laws of the house; and anxious to repair my fault,\nalso to know more of the one female in this mysterious community who had\nloved, or at all events had known marriage, I asked if I might see her.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, after some hesitation, still standing with eyes\ncast down. Then suddenly, bursting into tears, she exclaimed: \"Oh,\nSmith, how could you be in the world and not know that there is a mother\nin every house! How could you travel and not know that when you enter a\nhouse, after greeting the father, you first of all ask to be taken to\nthe mother to worship her and feel her hand on your head? Did you not\nsee that we were astonished and grieved at your silence when you came,\nand we waited in vain for you to speak?\"\n\nI was dumb with shame at her words. How well I remembered that first\nevening in the house, when I could not but see that something was\nexpected of me, yet never ventured to ask for enlightment!\n\nPresently, recovering from her tears, she went from the room, and, left\nalone, I was more than ever filled with wonder at what she had told me.\nI had not imagined that she had come into the world without a mother;\nnevertheless, the fact that this passionless girl, who had told me that\nthere was only one kind of love, was the daughter of a woman actually\nliving in the house, of whose existence I had never before heard, except\nin an indirect way which I failed to understand, seemed like a dream to\nme. Now I was about to see this hidden woman, and the interview would\nreveal something to me, for I would discover in her face and\nconversation whether she was in the same mystic state of mind as the\nothers, which made them seem like the dwellers in some better place than\nthis poor old sinful, sorrowful world. My wishes, however, were not to\nbe gratified, for presently Yoletta returned and said that her mother\ndid not desire to see me then. She looked so distressed when she told me\nthis, putting her white arms about my neck as if to console me for my\ndisappointment, that I refrained from pressing her with questions, and\nfor several days nothing more was spoken between us on the subject.\n\nAt length, one day when our lesson was over, with an expression of\nmingled pleasure and anxiety on her face, she rose and took my hand,\nsaying, \"Come.\"\n\nI knew she was going to take me to her mother, and rose to obey her\ngladly, for since the conversation I had had with her the desire to know\nthe lady of the house had given me no peace.\n\nLeaving the music room, we entered another apartment, of the same\nnave-like form, but vaster, or, at all events, considerably longer.\nThere I started and stood still, amazed at the scene before me. The\nlight, which found entrance through tall, narrow windows, was dim, but\nsufficient to show the whole room with everything in it, ending at the\nfurther extremity at a flight of broad stone steps. The middle part of\nthe floor, running the entire length of the apartment, was about twenty\nfeet wide, but on either side of this passage, which was covered with\nmosaic, the floor was raised; and on this higher level I saw, as I\nimagined, a great company of men and women, singly and in groups,\nstanding or seated on great stone chairs in various positions and\nattitudes. Presently I perceived that these were not living beings, but\nlife-like effigies of stone, the drapery they were represented as\nwearing being of many different richly-colored stones, having the\nappearance of real garments. So natural did the hair look, that only\nwhen I ascended the steps and touched the head of one of the statues was\nI convinced that it was also of stone. Even more wonderful in their\nresemblance to life were the eyes, which seemed to return my\nhalf-fearful glances with a calm, questioning scrutiny I found it hard\nto endure. I hurried on after my guide without speaking, but when I got\nto the middle of the room I paused involuntarily once more, so\nprofoundly did one of the statues impress me. It was of a woman of a\nmajestic figure and proud, beautiful face, with an abundance of\nsilvery-white hair. She sat bending forward with her eyes fixed on mine\nas I advanced, one hand pressed to her bosom, while with the other she\nseemed in the act of throwing back her white unbound tresses from her\nforehead. There was, I thought, a look of calm, unbending pride on the\nface, but on coming closer this expression disappeared, giving place to\none so wistful and pleading, so charged with subtle pain, that I stood\ngazing like one fascinated, until Yoletta took my hand and gently drew\nme away. Still, in spite of the absorbing nature of the matter on which\nI was bound, that strange face continued to haunt me, and glancing up\nand down through that long array of calm-browed, beautiful women, I\ncould see no one that was like it.\n\nArrived at the end of the gallery, we ascended the broad stone steps,\nand came to a landing twenty or thirty feet above the level of the floor\nwe had traversed. Here Yoletta pushed a glass door aside and ushered me\ninto another apartment--the Mother's Room. It was spacious, and, unlike\nthe gallery, well-lighted; the air in it was also warm and balmy, and\nseemed charged with a subtle aroma. But now my whole attention was\nconcentrated on a group of persons before me, and chiefly on its central\nfigure--the woman I had so much desired to see. She was seated, leaning\nback in a somewhat listless attitude, on a very large, low, couch-like\nseat, covered with a soft, violet-colored material. My very first glance\nat her face revealed to me that she differed in appearance and\nexpression from other inmates of the house: one reason was that she was\nextremely pale, and bore on her worn countenance the impress of\nlong-continued suffering; but that was not all. She wore her hair, which\nfell unbound on her shoulders, longer than the others, and her eyes\nlooked larger, and of a deeper green. There was something wonderfully\nfascinating to me in that pale, suffering face, for, in spite of\nsuffering, it was beautiful and loving; but dearer than all these things\nto my mind were the marks of passion it exhibited, the petulant, almost\nscornful mouth, and the half-eager, half-weary expression of the eyes,\nfor these seemed rather to belong to that imperfect world from which I\nhad been severed, and which was still dear to my unregenerate heart. In\nother respects also she differed from the rest of the women, her dress\nbeing a long, pale-blue robe, embroidered with saffron-colored flowers\nand foliage down the middle, and also on the neck and the wide sleeves.\nOn the couch at her side sat the father of the house, holding her hand\nand talking in low tones to her; two of the young women sat at her feet\non cushions, engaged on embroidery work, while another stood behind her;\none of the young men was also there, and was just now showing her a\nsketch, and apparently explaining something in it.\n\nI had expected to find a sick, feeble lady, in a dimly-lighted chamber,\nwith perhaps one attendant at her side; now, coming so unexpectedly\nbefore this proud-looking, beautiful woman, with so many about her, I\nwas completely abashed, and, feeling too confused to say anything, stood\nsilent and awkward in her presence.\n\n\"This is our stranger, Chastel,\" said the old man to her, at the same\ntime bestowing an encouraging look on me.\n\nShe turned from the sketch she had been studying, and raising herself\nslightly from her half-recumbent attitude, fixed her dark eyes on me\nwith some interest.\n\n\"I do not see why you were so much impressed,\" she remarked after a\nwhile. \"There is nothing very strange in him after all.\"\n\nI felt my face grow hot with shame and anger, for she seemed to look on\nme and speak of me--not to me--as if I had been some strange, semi-human\ncreature, discovered in the woods, and brought in as a great curiosity.\n\n\"No; it was not his countenance, only his curious garments and his words\nthat astonished us,\" said the father in reply.\n\nShe made no answer to this, but presently, addressing me directly, said:\n\"You were a long time in the house before you expressed a wish to see\nme.\"\n\nI found my speech then--a wretched, hesitating speech, for which I hated\nmyself--and replied, that I had asked to be allowed to see her as soon\nas I had been informed of her existence.\n\nShe turned on the father a look of surprise and inquiry.\n\n\"You must remember, Chastel,\" said he, \"that he comes to us from some\nstrange, distant island, having customs different from ours--a thing I\nhad never heard of before. I can give you no other explanation.\"\n\nHer lip curled, and then, turning to me, she continued: \"If there are\nhouses in your island without mothers in them, it is not so elsewhere in\nthe world. That you went out to travel so poorly provided with knowledge\nis a marvel to us; and as I have had the pain of telling you this, I\nmust regret that you ever left your own home.\"\n\nI could make no reply to these words, which fell on me like\nwhip-strokes; and looking at the other faces, I could see no sympathy in\nthem for me; as they looked at her--their mother--and listened to her\nwords, the expression they wore was love and devotion to her only,\nreminding me a little of the angel faces on Guide's canvas of the\n\"Coronation of the Virgin.\"\n\n\"Go now,\" she presently added in a petulant tone; \"I am tired, and wish\nto rest\"; and Yoletta, who had been standing silently by me all the\ntime, took my hand and led me from the room.\n\nWith eyes cast down I passed through the gallery, paying no attention to\nits strange, stony occupants; and leaving my gentle conductress without\na word at the door of the music-room, I hurried away from the house. For\nI could feel love and compassion in the touch of the dear girl's hand,\nand it seemed to me that if she had spoken one word, my overcharged\nheart would have found vent in tears. I only wished to be alone, to\nbrood in secret on my pain and the bitterness of defeat; for it was\nplain that the woman I had so wished to see, and, since seeing her, so\nwished to be allowed to love, felt towards me nothing but contempt and\naversion, and that from no fault of my own, she, whose friendship I most\nneeded, was become my enemy in the house.\n\nMy steps took me to the river. Following its banks for about a mile, I\ncame at last to a grove of stately old trees, and there I seated myself\non a large twisted root projecting over the water. To this sequestered\nspot I had come to indulge my resentful feelings; for here I could speak\nout my bitterness aloud, if I felt so minded, where there were no\nwitnesses to hear me. I had restrained those unmanly tears, so nearly\nshed in Yoletta's presence, and kept back by dark thoughts on the way;\nnow I was sitting quietly by myself, safe from observation, safe even\nfrom that sympathy my bruised spirit could not suffer.\n\nScarcely had I seated myself before a great brown animal, with black\neyes, round and fierce, rose to the surface of the stream half a dozen\nyards from my feet; then quickly catching sight of me, it plunged\nnoisily again under water, breaking the clear image reflected there with\na hundred ripples. I waited for the last wavelet to fade away, but when\nthe surface was once more still and smooth as dark glass, I began to be\naffected by the profounded silence and melancholy of nature, and by a\nsomething proceeding from nature--phantom, emanation, essence, I know\nnot what. My soul, not my sense, perceived it, standing with finger on\nlips, there, close to me; its feet resting on the motionless water,\nwhich gave no reflection of its image, the clear amber sunlight passing\nundimmed through its substance. To my soul its spoken \"Hush!\" was\naudible, and again, and yet again, it said \"Hush!\" until the tumult in\nme was still, and I could not think my own thoughts. I could thereafter\nonly listen, breathless, straining my senses to catch some natural\nsound, however faint. Far away in the dim distance, in some blue\npasture, a cow was lowing, and the recurring sound passed me like the\nhumming flight of an insect, then fainter still, like an imagined sound,\nuntil it ceased. A withered leaf fell from the tree-top; I heard it\nfluttering downwards, touching other leaves in its fall until the silent\ngrass received it. Then, as I listened for another leaf, suddenly from\noverhead came the brief gushing melody of some late singer, a robin-like\nsound, ringing out clear and distinct as a flourish on a clarionet:\nbrilliant, joyous, and unexpected, yet in keeping with that melancholy\nquiet, affecting the mind like a spray of gold and scarlet embroidery on\na pale, neutral ground. The sun went down, and in setting, kindled the\nboles of the old trees here and there into pillars of red fire, while\nothers in deeper shade looked by contrast like pillars of ebony; and\nwherever the foliage was thinnest, the level rays shining through\nimparted to the sere leaves a translucence and splendor that was like\nthe stained glass in the windows of some darkening cathedral. All along\nthe river a white mist began to rise, a slight wind sprang up and the\nvapor drifted, drowning the reeds and bushes, and wreathing its ghostly\narms about the old trees: and watching the mist, and listening to the\n\"hallowed airs and symphonies\" whispered by the low wind, I felt that\nthere was no longer any anger in my heart. Nature, and something in and\nyet more than nature, had imparted her \"soft influences\" and healed her\n\"wandering and distempered child\" until he could no more be a \"jarring\nand discordant thing\" in her sweet and sacred presence.\n\nWhen I looked up a change had come over the scene: the round, full moon\nhad risen, silvering the mist, and filling the wide, dim earth with a\nnew mysterious glory. I rose from my seat and returned to the house, and\nwith that new insight and comprehension which had come to me--that\n_message_, as I could not but regard it--I now felt nothing but\nlove and sympathy for the suffering woman who had wounded me with her\nunmerited displeasure, and my only desire was to show my devotion to\nher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\nAs I approached the building, soft strains floating far out into the\nnight-air became audible, and I knew that the sweet spirit of music, to\nwhich they were all so devoted, was present with them. After listening\nfor awhile in the shadow of the portico I went in, and, anxious to avoid\ndisturbing the singers, stole away into a dusky corner, where I sat down\nby myself. Yoletta had, however, seen me enter, for presently she came\nto me.\n\n\"Why did you not come in to supper, Smith?\" she said. \"And why do you\nlook so sad?\"\n\n\"Do you need to ask, Yoletta? Ah, it would have made me so happy if I\ncould have won your mother's affection! If she only knew how much I wish\nfor it, and how much I sympathize with her! But she will never like me,\nand all I wished to say to her must be left unsaid.\"\n\n\"No, not so,\" she said. \"Come with me to her now: if you feel like that,\nshe will be kind to you--how should it be otherwise?\"\n\nI greatly feared that she advised me to take an imprudent step; but she\nwas my guide, my teacher and friend in the house, and I resolved to do\nas she wished. There were no lights in the long gallery when we entered\nit again, only the white moonbeams coming through the tall windows here\nand there lit up a column or a group of statues, which threw long, black\nshadows on floor and Wall, giving the chamber a weird appearance. Once\nmore, when I reached the middle of the room, I paused, for there before\nme, ever bending forward, sat that wonderful woman of stone, the\nmoonlight streaming full on her pale, wistful face and silvery hair.\n\n\"Tell me, Yoletta, who is this?\" I whispered. \"Is it a statue of some\none who lived in this house?\"\n\n\"Yes; you can read about her in the history of the house, and in this\ninscription on the stone. She was a mother, and her name was Isarte.\"\n\n\"But why has she that strange, haunting expression on her face? Was she\nunhappy?\"\n\n\"Oh, can you not see that she was unhappy! She endured many sorrows, and\nthe crowning calamity of her life was the loss of seven loved sons. They\nwere away in the mountains together, and did not return when expected:\nfor many years she waited for tidings of them. It was conjectured that a\ngreat rock had fallen on and crushed them beneath it. Grief for her lost\nchildren made her hair white, and gave that expression to her face.\"\n\n\"And when did this happen?\"\n\n\"Over two thousand years ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, then it is a very old family tradition. But the statue--when was\nthat made and placed here?\"\n\n\"She had it made and placed here herself. It was her wish that the grief\nshe endured should be remembered in the house for all time, for no one\nhad ever suffered like her; and the inscription, which she caused to be\nput on the stone, says that if there shall ever come to a mother in the\nhouse a sorrow exceeding hers, the statue shall be removed from its\nplace and destroyed, and the fragments buried in the earth with all\nforgotten things, and the name of Isarte forgotten in the house.\"\n\nIt oppressed my mind to think of so long a period of time during which\nthat unutterably sad face had gazed down on so many generations of the\nliving. \"It is most strange!\" I murmured. \"But do you think it right,\nYoletta, that the grief of one person should be perpetuated like that in\nthe house; for who can look on this face without pain, even when it is\nremembered that the sorrow it expresses ended so many centuries ago?\"\n\n\"But she was a mother, Smith, do you not understand? It would not be\nright for us to wish to have our griefs remembered for ever, to cause\nsorrow to those who succeed us; but a mother is different: her wishes\nare sacred, and what she wills is right.\"\n\nHer words surprised me not a little, for I had heard of infallible men,\nbut never of women; moreover, the woman I was now going to see was also\na \"mother in the house,\" a successor to this very Isarte. Fearing that I\nhad touched on a dangerous topic, I said no more, and proceeding on our\nway, we soon reached the mother's room, the large glass door of which\nnow stood wide open. In the pale light of the moon--for there was no\nother in the room--we found Chastel on the couch where I had seen her\nbefore, but she was lying extended at full length now, and had only one\nattendant with her.\n\nYoletta approached her, and, stooping, touched her lips to the pale,\nstill face. \"Mother,\" she said, \"I have brought Smith again; he is\nanxious to say something to you, if you will hear him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will hear him,\" she replied. \"Let him sit near me; and now go\nback, for your voice is needed. And you may also leave me now,\" she\nadded, addressing the other lady.\n\nThe two then departed together, and I proceeded to seat myself on a\ncushion beside the couch.\n\n\"What is it you wish to say to me?\" she asked. The words were not very\nencouraging, but her voice sounded gentler now, and I at once began.\n\"Hush,\" she said, before I had spoken two words. \"Wait until this\nends--I am listening to Yoletta's voice.\"\n\nThrough the long, dusky gallery and the open doors soft strains of music\nwere floating to us, and now, mingling with the others, a clearer,\nbell-like voice was heard, which soared to greater heights; but soon\nthis ceased to be distinguishable, and then she sighed and addressed me\nagain. \"Where have you been all the evening, for you were not at\nsupper?\"\n\n\"Did you know that?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, I know everything that passes in the house. Reading and work of\nall kinds are a pain and weariness. The only thing left to me is to\nlisten to what others do or say, and to know all their comings and\ngoings. My life is nothing now but a shadow of other people's lives.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"I must tell you how I spent the time after seeing you\nto-day; for I was alone, and no other person can say what I did. I went\naway along the river until I came to the grove of great trees on the\nbank, and there I sat until the moon rose, with my heart full of\nunspeakable pain and bitterness.\"\n\n\"What made you have those feelings?\"\n\n\"When I heard of you, and saw you, my heart was drawn to you, and I\nwished above all things in the world to be allowed to love and serve\nyou, and to have a share in your affection; but your looks and words\nexpressed only contempt and dislike towards me. Would it not have been\nstrange if I had not felt extremely unhappy?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she replied, \"now I can understand the reason of the surprise your\nwords have often caused in the house! Your very feelings seem unlike\nours. No other person would have experienced the feelings you speak of\nfor such a cause. It is right to repent your faults, and to bear the\nburden of them quietly; but it is a sign of an undisciplined spirit to\nfeel bitterness, and to wish to cast the blame of your suffering on\nanother. You forget that I had reason to be deeply offended with you.\nYou also forget my continual suffering, which sometimes makes me seem\nharsh and unkind against my will.\"\n\n\"Your words seem only sweet and gracious now,\" I returned. \"They have\nlifted a great weight from my heart, and I wish I could repay you for\nthem by taking some portion of your suffering on myself.\"\n\n\"It is right that you should have that feeling, but idle to express it,\"\nshe answered gravely. \"If such wishes could be fulfilled my sufferings\nwould have long ceased, since any one of my children would gladly lay\ndown his life to procure me ease.\"\n\nTo this speech, which sounded like another rebuke, I made no reply.\n\n\"Oh, this is bitterness indeed--a bitterness you cannot know,\" she\nresumed after a while. \"For you and for others there is always the\nrefuge of death from continued sufferings: the brief pang of\ndissolution, bravely met, is nothing in comparison with a lingering\nagony like mine, with its long days and longer nights, extending to\nyears, and that great blackness of the end ever before the mind. This\nonly a mother can know, since the horror of utter darkness, and vain\nclinging to life, even when it has ceased to have any hope or joy in it,\nis the penalty she must pay for her higher state.\"\n\nI could not understand all her words, and only murmured in reply: \"You\nare young to speak of death.\"\n\n\"Yes, young; that is why it is so bitter to think of. In old age the\nfeelings are not so keen.\" Then suddenly she put out her hands towards\nme, and, when I offered mine, caught my fingers with a nervous grasp and\ndrew herself to a sitting position. \"Ah, why must I be afflicted with a\nmisery others have not known!\" she exclaimed excitedly. \"To be lifted\nabove the others, when so young; to have one child only; then after so\nbrief a period of happiness, to be smitten with barrenness, and this\nlingering malady ever gnawing like a canker at the roots of life! Who\nhas suffered like me in the house? You only, Isarte, among the dead. I\nwill go to you, for my grief is more than I can bear; and it may be that\nI shall find comfort even in speaking to the dead, and to a stone. Can\nyou bear me in your arms?\" she said, clasping me round the neck. \"Take\nme up in your arms and carry me to Isarte.\"\n\nI knew what she meant, having so recently heard the story of Isarte, and\nin obedience to her command I raised her from the couch. She was tall,\nand heavier than I had expected, though so greatly emaciated; but the\nthought that she was Yoletta's mother, and the mother of the house,\nnerved me to my task, and cautiously moving step by step through the\ngloom, I carried her safely to that white-haired, moonlit woman of stone\nin the long gallery. When I had ascended the steps and brought her\nsufficiently near, she put her arms about the statue, and pressed its\nstony lips with hers.\n\n\"Isarte, Isarte, how cold your lips are!\" she murmured, in low,\ndesponding tones. \"Now, when I look into these eyes, which are yours,\nand yet not yours, and kiss these stony lips, how sorely does the hunger\nin my heart tempt me to sin! But suffering has not darkened my reason; I\nknow it is an offense to ask anything of Him who gives us life and all\ngood things freely, and has no pleasure in seeing us miserable. This\nthought restrains me; else I would cry to Him to turn this stone to\nflesh, and for one brief hour to bring back to it the vanished spirit of\nIsarte. For there is no one living that can understand my pain; but you\nwould understand it, and put my tired head against your breast, and\ncover me with your grief-whitened hair as with a mantle. For your pain\nwas like mine, and exceeded mine, and no soul could measure it,\ntherefore in the hunger of your heart you looked far off into the\nfuture, where some one would perhaps have a like affliction, and suffer\nwithout hope, as you suffered, and measure your pain, and love your\nmemory, and feel united with you, even over the gulf of long centuries\nof time. You would speak to me of it all, and tell me that the greatest\ngrief was to go away into darkness, leaving no one with your blood and\nyour spirit to inherit the house. This also is my grief, Isarte, for I\nam barren and eaten up by death, and must soon go away to be where you\nare. When I am gone, the father of the house will take no other one to\nhis bosom, for he is old, and his life is nearly complete; and in a\nlittle while he will follow me, but with no pain and anguish like mine\nto cloud his serene spirit. And who will then inherit our place? Ah, my\nsister, how bitter to think of it! for then a stranger will be the\nmother of the house, and my one only child will sit at her feet, calling\nher mother, serving her with her hands, and loving and worshiping her\nwith her heart!\"\n\nThe excitement had now burned itself out: she had dropped her head\nwearily on my shoulder, and bade me take her back. When I had safely\ndeposited her on the couch again, she remained for some minutes with her\nface covered, silently weeping.\n\nThe scene in the gallery had deeply affected me; now, however, while I\nsat by her, pondering over it, my mind reverted to that vanished world\nof sorrow and different social conditions in which I had lived, and\nwhere the lot of so many poor suffering souls seemed to me so much more\ndesolate than that of this unhappy lady, who had, I imagined, much to\nconsole her. It even seemed to me that the grief I had witnessed was\nsomewhat morbid and overstrained; and, thinking that it would perhaps\ndivert her mind from brooding too much over her own troubles, I\nventured, when she had grown calm again, to tell her some of my\nmemories. I asked her to imagine a state of the world and the human\nfamily, in which all women were, in one sense, on an equality--all\npossessing the same capacity for suffering; and where all were, or would\nbe, wives and mothers, and without any such mysterious remedy against\nlingering pain as she had spoken of. But I had not proceeded far with my\npicture before she interrupted me.\n\n\"Do not say more,\" she said, with an accent of displeasure. \"This, I\nsuppose, is another of those grotesque fancies you sometimes give\nexpression to, about which I heard a great deal when you first came to\nus. That all people should be equal, and all women wives and mothers\nseems to me a very disordered and a very repulsive idea The one\nconsolation in my pain, the one glory of my life could not exist in such\na state as that, and my condition would be pitiable indeed. All others\nwould be equally miserable. The human race would multiply, until the\nfruits of the soil would be insufficient for its support; and earth\nwould be filled with degenerate beings, starved in body and debased in\nmind--all clinging to an existence utterly without joy. Life is dark to\nme, but not to others: these are matters beyond you, and it is\npresumptuous in one of your condition to attempt to comfort me with idle\nfancies.\"\n\nAfter some moments of silence, she resumed: \"The father has said to-day\nthat you came to us from an island where even the customs of the people\nare different from ours; and perhaps one of their unhappy methods is to\nseek to medicine a real misery by imagining some impossible and\nimmeasurably greater one. In no other way can I account for your strange\nwords to me; for I cannot believe that any race exists so debased as\nactually to practice the things you speak of. Remember that I do not ask\nor desire to be informed. We have a different way; for although it is\nconceivable that present misery might be mitigated, or forgotten for a\nseason, by giving up the soul to delusions, even by summoning before the\nmind repulsive and horrible images, that would be to put to an unlawful\nuse, and to pervert, the brightest faculties our Father has given us:\ntherefore we seek no other support in all sufferings and calamities but\nthat of reason only. If you wish for my affection, you will not speak of\nsuch things again, but will endeavor to purify yourself from a mental\nvice, which may sometimes, in periods of suffering, give you a false\ncomfort for a brief season, only to degrade you, and sink you later in a\ndeeper misery. You must now leave me.\"\n\nThis unexpected and sharp rebuke did not anger me, but it made me very\nsad; for I now perceived plainly enough that no great advantage would\ncome to me from Chastel's acquaintance, since it was necessary to be so\nvery circumspect with her. Deeply troubled, and in a somewhat confused\nstate of mind, I rose to depart. Then she placed her thin, feverish\nwhite hand on mine. \"You need not go away again,\" she said, \"to indulge\nin bitter feelings by yourself because I have said this to you. You may\ncome with the others to see me and talk to me whenever I am able to sit\nhere and bear it. I shall not remember your offense, but shall be glad\nto know that there is another soul in the house to love and honor me.\"\n\nWith such comfort as these words afforded I returned to the music-room,\nand, finding it empty, went out to the terrace, where the others were\nnow strolling about in knots and couples, conversing and enjoying the\nlovely moonlight. Wandering a little distance away by myself, I sat down\non a bench under a tree, and presently Yoletta came to me there, and\nclosely scrutinized my face.\n\n\"Have you nothing to tell me?\" she asked. \"Are you happier now?\"\n\n\"Yes, dearest, for I have been spoke to very kindly; and I should have\nbeen happier if only--\" But I checked myself in time, and said no more\nto her about my conversation with the mother. To myself I said: \"Oh,\nthat island, that island! Why can't I forget its miserable customs, or,\nat any rate, stick to my own resolution to hold my tongue about them?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nFrom that day I was frequently allowed to enter the Mother's Room, but,\nas I had feared, these visits failed to bring me into any closer\nrelationship with the lady of the house. She had indeed forgotten my\noffense: I was one of her children, sharing equally with the others in\nher impartial affection, and privileged to sit at her feet to relate to\nher the incidents of the day, or describe all I had seen, and sometimes\nto touch her thin white hand with my lips. But the distance separating\nus was not forgotten. At the two first interviews she had taught me,\nonce for all, that it was for me to love, honor, and serve her, and that\nanything beyond that--any attempt to win her confidence, to enter into\nher thoughts, or make her understand my feelings and aspirations--was\nregarded as pure presumption on my part. The result was that I was less\nhappy than I had been before knowing her: my naturally buoyant and\nhopeful temper became tinged with melancholy, and that vision of\nexquisite bliss in the future, which had floated before me, luring me\non, now began to look pale, and to seem further and further away.\n\nAfter my walk with Yoletta--if it can be called a walk--I began to look\nout for the rainbow lilies, and soon discovered that everywhere under\nthe grass they were beginning to sprout from the soil. At first I found\nthem in the moist valley of the river, but very soon they were equally\nabundant on the higher lands, and even on barren, stony places, where\nthey appeared latest. I felt very curious about these flowers, of which\nYoletta had spoken so enthusiastically, and watched the slow growth of\nthe long, slender buds from day to day with considerable impatience. At\nlength, in a moist hollow of the forest, I was delighted to find the\nfull-blown flower. In shape it resembled a tulip, but was more open, and\nthe color a most vivid orange yellow; it had a slight delicate perfume,\nand was very pretty, with a peculiar waxy gloss on the thick petals,\nstill, I was rather disappointed, since the name of \"rainbow lily,\" and\nYoletta's words, had led me to expect a many-colored flower of\nsurpassing beauty.\n\nI plucked the lily carefully, and was taking it home to present it to\nher, when all at once I remembered that only on one occasion had I seen\nflowers in her hand, and in the hands of the others, and that was when\nthey were burying their dead. They never wore a flower, nor had I ever\nseen one in the house, not even in that room where Chastel was kept a\nprisoner by her malady, and where her greatest delight was to have\nnature in all its beauty and fragrance brought to her in the\nconversation of her children. The only flowers in the house were in\ntheir illuminations, and those wrought in metal and carved in wood, and\nthe immortal, stony flowers of many brilliant hues in their mosaics. I\nbegan to fear that there was some superstition which made it seem wrong\nto them to gather flowers, except for funeral ceremonies, and afraid of\noffending from want of thought, I dropped the lily on the ground, and\nsaid nothing about it to any one.\n\nThen, before any more open lilies were found, an unexpected sorrow came\nto me. After changing my dress on returning from the fields one\nafternoon, I was taken to the hall of judgment, and at once jumped to\nthe conclusion that I had again unwittingly fallen into disgrace; but on\narriving at that uncomfortable apartment I perceived that this was not\nthe case. Looking round at the assembled company I missed Yoletta, and\nmy heart sank in me, and I even wished that my first impression had\nproved correct. On the great stone table, before which the father was\nseated, lay an open folio, the leaf displayed being only illuminated at\nthe top and inner margin; the colored part at the top I noticed was\ntorn, the rent extending down to about the middle of the page.\n\nPresently the dear girl appeared, with tearful eyes and flushed face,\nand advancing hurriedly to the father, she stood before him with\ndowncast eyes.\n\n\"My daughter, tell me how and why you did this?\" he demanded, pointing\nto the open volume.\n\n\"Oh, father, look at this,\" she returned, half-sobbing, and touching the\nlower end of the colored margin with her finger. \"Do you see how badly\nit is colored? And I had spent three days in altering and retouching it,\nand still it displeased me. Then, in sudden anger, I pushed the book\nfrom me, and seeing it slipping from the stand I caught the leaf to\nprevent it from falling, and it was torn by the weight of the book. Oh,\ndear father, will you forgive me?\"\n\n\"Forgive you, my daughter? Do you not know how it grieves my heart to\npunish you; but how can this offense to the house be forgiven, which\nmust stand in evidence against us from generation to generation? For we\ncease to be, but the house remains; and the writing we leave on it,\nwhether it be good or evil, that too remains for ever. An unkind word is\nan evil thing, an unkind deed a worse, but when these are repented they\nmay be forgiven and forgotten. But an injury done to the house cannot be\nforgotten, for it is the flaw in the stone that keeps its place, the\ncrude, inharmonious color which cannot be washed out with water.\nConsider, my daughter, in the long life of the house, how many unborn\nmen will turn the leaves of this book, and coming to this leaf will be\noffended at so grievous a disfigurement! If we of this generation were\ndestined to live for ever, then it might be written on this page for a\npunishment and warning:\" Yoletta tore it in her anger. \"But we must pass\naway and be nothing to succeeding generations, and it would not be right\nthat Yoletta's name should be remembered for the wrong she did to the\nhouse, and all she did for its good forgotten.\"\n\nA painful silence ensued, then, lifting her tear-stained face, she said:\n\"Oh father, what must my punishment be?\"\n\n\"Dear child, it will be a light one, for we consider your youth and\nimpulsive nature, and also that the wrong you did was partly the result\nof accident. For thirty days you must live apart from us, subsisting on\nbread and water, and holding intercourse with one person only, who will\nassist you with your work and provide you with all things necessary.\"\n\nThis seemed to me a harsh, even a cruel punishment for so trivial an\noffense, or accident, rather; but she was not perhaps of the same mind,\nfor she kissed his hand, as if in gratitude for his leniency.\n\n\"Tell me, child,\" he said, putting his hand on her head, and regarding\nher with misty eyes, \"who shall attend you in your seclusion?\"\n\n\"Edra,\" she murmured; and the other, coming forward, took her by the\nhand and led her away.\n\nI gazed eagerly after her as she retired, hungering for one look from\nher dear eyes before that long separation; but they were filled with\ntears and bent on the floor, and in a moment she was gone from sight.\n\nThe succeeding days were to me dreary beyond description. For the first\ntime I became fully conscious of the strength of a passion which had now\nbecome a consuming fire in my breast, and could only end in utter\nmisery--perhaps in destruction--or else in a degree of happiness no\nmortal had ever tasted before. I went about listlessly, like one on whom\nsome heavy calamity has fallen: all interest in my work was lost; my\nfood seemed tasteless; study and conversation had become a weariness;\neven in those divine concerts, which fitly brought each tranquil day to\nits close, there was no charm now, since Yoletta's voice, which love had\ntaught my dull ear to distinguish no longer had any part in it. I was\nnot allowed to enter the Mother's Room of an evening now, and the\nexclusion extended also to the others, Edra only excepted; for at this\nhour, when it was customary for the family to gather in the music-room,\nYoletta was taken from her lonely chamber to be with her mother. This\nwas told me, and I also elicited, by means of some roundabout\nquestioning, that it was always in the mother's power to have any\nper-son undergoing punishment taken to her, she being, as it were, above\nthe law. She could even pardon a delinquent and set him free if she felt\nso minded, although in this case she had not chosen to exercise her\nprerogative, probably because her \"sufferings had not clouded her\nunderstanding.\" They were treating her very hardly--father and mother\nboth--I thought in my bitterness.\n\nThe gradual opening of the rainbow lilies served only to remind me every\nhour and every minute of that bright young spirit thus harshly deprived\nof the pleasure she had so eagerly anticipated. She, above them all,\nrejoiced in the beauty of this visible world, regarding nature in some\nof its moods and aspects with a feeling almost bordering on adoration;\nbut, alas! she alone was shut out from this glory which God had spread\nover the earth for the delight of all his children.\n\nNow I knew why these autumnal flowers were called rainbow lilies, and\nremembered how Yoletta had told me that they gave a beauty to the earth\nwhich could not be described or imagined. The flowers were all\nundoubtedly of one species, having the same shape and perfume, although\nvarying greatly in size, according to the nature of the soil on which\nthey grew. But in different situations they varied in color, one color\nblending with, or passing by degrees into another, wherever the soil\naltered its character. Along the valleys, where they first began to\nbloom, and in all moist situations, the hue was yellow, varying,\naccording to the amount of moisture in different places, from pale\nprimrose to deep orange, this passing again into vivid scarlet and reds\nof many shades. On the plains the reds prevailed, changing into various\npurples on hills and mountain slopes; but high on the mountains the\ncolor was blue; and this also had many gradations, from the lower deep\ncornflower blue to a delicate azure on the summits, resembling that of\nthe forget-me-not and hairbell.\n\nThe weather proved singularly favorable to those who spent their time in\nadmiring the lilies, and this now seemed to be almost the only\noccupation of the inmates, excepting, of course, sick Chastel,\nimprisoned Yoletta, and myself--I being too forlorn to admire anything.\nCalm, bright days without a cloud succeeded each other, as if the very\nelements held the lilies sacred and ventured not to cast any shadow over\ntheir mystic splendor. Each morning one of the men would go out some\ndistance from the house and blow on a horn, which could be heard\ndistinctly two miles away; and presently a number of horses, in couples\nand troops, would come galloping in, after which they would remain all\nthe morning grazing and gamboling about the house. These horses were now\nin constant requisition, all the members of the family, male and female,\nspending several hours every day in careering over the surrounding\ncountry, seemingly without any particular object. The contagion did not\naffect me, however, for, although I had always been a bold rider (in my\nown country), and excessively fond of horseback exercise, their fashion\nof riding without bridles, and on diminutive straw saddles, seemed to me\nneither safe nor pleasant.\n\nOne morning after breakfasting, I took my ax, and was proceeding slowly,\nimmersed in thought, to the forest, when hearing a slight swishing sound\nof hoofs on the grass, I turned and beheld the venerable father, mounted\non his charger, and rushing away towards the hills at an insanely\nbreak-neck pace. His long garment was gathered tightly round his spare\nform, his feet drawn up and his head bent far forward, while the wind of\nhis speed divided his beard, which flew out in two long streamers\nbehind. All at once he caught sight of me, and, touching the animal's\nneck, swept gracefully round in narrowing circles, each circle bringing\nhim nearer, until he came to a stand at my side; then his horse began\nrubbing his nose on my hand, its breath feeling like fire on my skin.\n\n\"Smith,\" said he, with a grave smile, \"if you cannot be happy unless you\nare laboring in the forest with your ax you must proceed with your\nwood-cutting; but I confess it surprises me as much to see you going to\nwork on a day like this, as it would to see you walking inverted on your\nhands, and dangling your heels in the air.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said I, surprised at this speech.\n\n\"If you do not know I must tell you. At night we sleep; in the morning\nwe bathe; we eat when we are hungry, converse when we feel inclined, and\non most days labor a certain number of hours. But more than these\nthings, which have a certain amount of pleasure in them, are the\nprecious moments when nature reveals herself to us in all her beauty. We\ngive ourselves wholly to her then, and she refreshes us; the splendor\nfades, but the wealth it brings to the soul remains to gladden us. That\nmust be a dull spirit that cannot suspend its toil when the sun is\nsetting in glory, or the violet rainbow appears on the cloud. Every day\nbrings us special moments to gladden us, just as we have in the house\nevery day our time of melody and recreation. But this supreme and more\nenduring glory of nature comes only once every year; and while it lasts,\nall labor, except that which is pressing and necessary, is unseemly, and\nan offense to the Father of the world.\" He paused, but I did not know\nwhat to say in reply, and presently he resumed: \"My son, there are\nhorses waiting for you, and unless you are more unlike us in mind than I\never imagined, you will now take one and ride to the hills, where, owing\nto the absence of forests, the earth can now be seen at its best.\"\n\nI was about to thank him and turn back, but the thought of Yoletta, to\nwhom each heavy day now seemed a year, oppressed by heart, and I\ncontinued standing motionless, with downcast eyes, wishing, yet fearing,\nto speak.\n\n\"Why is your mind troubled, my son?\" he said kindly.\n\n\"Father,\" I answered, that word which I now ventured to use for the\nfirst time trembling from my lips, \"the beauty of the earth is very much\nto me, but I cannot help remembering that to Yoletta it is even more,\nand the thought takes away all my pleasure. The flowers will fade, and\nshe will not see them.\"\n\n\"My son, I am glad to hear these words,\" he answered, somewhat to my\nsurprise, for I had greatly feared that I had adopted too bold a course.\n\"For I see now,\" he continued, \"that this seeming indifference, which\ngave me some pain, does not proceed from an incapacity on your part to\nfeel as we do, but from a tender love and compassion--that most precious\nof all our emotions, which will serve to draw you closer to us. I have\nalso thought much of Yoletta during these beautiful days, grieving for\nher, and this morning I have allowed her to go out into the hills, so\nthat during this day, at least, she will be able to share in our\npleasure.\"\n\nScarcely waiting for another word to be spoken, I flew back to the\nhouse, anxious enough for a ride now. The little straw saddle seemed now\nas comfortable as a couch, nor was the bridle missed; for, nerved with\nthat intense desire to find and speak to my love, I could have ridden\nsecurely on the slippery back of a giraffe, charging over rough ground\nwith a pack of lions at its heels. Away I went at a speed never perhaps\nattained by any winner of the Derby, which made the shining hairs of my\nhorse's mane whistle in the still air; down valleys, up hills, flying\nlike a bird over roaring burns, rocks, and thorny bushes, never pausing\nuntil I was far away among those hills where that strange accident had\nbefallen me, and from which I had recovered to find the earth so\nchanged. I then ascended a great green hill, the top of which must have\nbeen over a thousand feet above the surrounding country. When I had at\nlength reached this elevation, which I did walking and climbing, my\nsteed docilely scrambling up after me, the richness and novelty of the\nunimaginable and indescribable scene which opened before me affected me\nin a strange way, smiting my heart with a pain intense and unfamiliar.\nFor the first time I experienced within myself that miraculous power the\nmind possesses of reproducing instantaneously, and without perspective,\nthe events, feelings, and thoughts of long years--an experience which\nsometimes comes to a person suddenly confronted with death, and in other\nmoments of supreme agitation. A thousand memories and a thousand\nthoughts were stirring in me: I was conscious now, as I had not been\nbefore, of the past and the present, and these two existed in my mind,\nyet separated by a great gulf of time--a blank and a nothingness which\nyet oppressed me with its horrible vastness. How aimless and solitary,\nhow awful my position seemed! It was like that of one beneath whose feet\nthe world suddenly crumbles into ashes and dust, and is scattered\nthroughout the illimitable void, while he survives, blown to some far\nplanet whose strange aspect, however beautiful, fills him with an\nundefinable terror. And I knew, and the knowledge only intensified my\npain, that my agitation, the strugglings of my soul to recover that lost\nlife, were like the vain wing-beats of some woodland bird, blown away a\nthousand miles over the sea, into which it must at last sink down and\nperish.\n\nSuch a mental state cannot endure for more than a few moments, and\npassing away, it left me weary and despondent. With dull, joyless eyes I\ncontinued gazing for upwards of an hour on the prospect beneath me; for\nI had now given up all hopes of seeing Yoletta, not yet having\nencountered a single person since starting for my ride. All about me the\nsummit was dotted with small lilies of a delicate blue, but at a little\ndistance the sober green of the grass became absorbed, as it were, in\nthe brighter flower-tints, and the neighboring summits all appeared of a\npure cerulean hue. Lower down this passed into the purples of the slopes\nand the reds of the plains, while the valleys, fringed with scarlet,\nwere like rivers of crocus-colored fire. Distance, and the light,\nautumnal haze, had a subduing and harmonizing effect on the sea of\nbrilliant color, and further away on the immense horizon it all faded\ninto the soft universal blue. Over this flowery paradise my eyes\nwandered restlessly, for my heart was restless in me, and had lost the\npower of pleasure. With a slight bitterness I recalled some of the words\nthe father had spoken to me that morning. It was all very well, I\nthought, for this venerable graybeard to talk about refreshing the soul\nwith the sight of all this beauty; but he seemed to lose sight of the\nimportant fact that there was a considerable difference in our\nrespective ages, that the raging hunger of the heart, which he had\ndoubtless experienced at one time of his life, was, like bodily hunger,\nnot to be appeased with splendid sunsets, rainbows and rainbow lilies,\nhowever beautiful they might seem to the eye.\n\nPresently, on a second and lower summit of the long mountain I had\nascended, I caught sight of a person on horseback, standing motionless\nas a figure of stone. At that distance the horse looked no bigger than a\ngreyhound, yet so marvelously transparent was the mountain air, that I\ndistinctly recognized Yoletta in the rider. I started up, and sprang\njoyfully onto my own horse, and waving my hand to attract her attention,\ngalloped recklessly down the slope; but when I reached the opposing\nsummit she was no longer there, nor anywhere in sight, and it was as if\nthe earth had opened and swallowed her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\nDuring Yoletta's seclusion, my education was not allowed to suffer, her\nplace as instructress having been taken by Edra. I was pleased with this\narrangement, thinking to derive some benefit from it, beyond what she\nmight teach me; but very soon I was forced to abandon all hope of\ncommunicating with the imprisoned girl through her friend and jailer.\nEdra was much disturbed at the suggestion; for I did venture to suggest\nit, though in a tentative, roundabout form, not feeling sure of my\nground: previous mistakes had made me cautious. Her manner was a\nsufficient warning; and I did not broach the subject a second time. One\nafternoon, however, I met with a great and unexpected consolation,\nthough even this was mixed with some perplexing matters.\n\nOne day, after looking long and earnestly into my face, said my gentle\nteacher to me; \"Do you know that you are changed? All your gay spirits\nhave left you, and you are pale and thin and sad. Why is this?\"\n\nMy face crimsoned at this very direct question, for I knew of that\nchange in me, and went about in continual fear that others would\npresently notice it, and draw their own conclusions. She continued\nlooking at me, until for very shame I turned my face aside; for if I had\nconfessed that separation from Yoletta caused my dejection, she would\nknow what that feeling meant, and I feared that any such premature\ndeclaration would be the ruin of my prospects.\n\n\"I know the reason, though I ask you,\" she continued, placing a hand on\nmy shoulder. \"You are grieving for Yoletta--I saw it from the first. I\nshall tell her how pale and sad you have grown--how different from what\nyou were. But why do you turn your face from me?\"\n\nI was perplexed, but her sympathy gave me courage, and made me\ndetermined to give her my confidence. \"If you know,\" said I, \"that I am\ngrieving for Yoletta, can you not also guess why I hesitate and hide my\nface from you?\"\n\n\"No; why is it? You love me also, though not with so great a love; but\nwe _do_ love each other, Smith, and you can confide in me?\"\n\nI looked into her face now, straight into her transparent eyes, and it\nwas plain to see that she had not yet guessed my meaning.\n\n\"Dearest Edra,\" I said, taking her hand, \"I love you as much as if one\nmother had given us birth. But I love Yoletta with a different love--not\nas one loves a sister. She is more to me than any one else in the world;\nso much is she that life without her would be a burden. Do you not know\nwhat that means?\" And then, remembering Yoletta's words on the hills, I\nadded: \"Do you not know of more than one kind of love?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, still gazing inquiringly into my face. \"But I know\nthat your love for her so greatly exceeds all others, that it is like a\ndifferent feeling. I shall tell her, since it is sweet to be loved, and\nshe will be glad to know it.\"\n\n\"And after you have told her, Edra, shall you make known her reply to\nme?\"\n\n\"No, Smith; it is an offense to suggest, or even to think, such a thing,\nhowever much you may love her, for she is not allowed to converse with\nany one directly or through me. She told me that she saw you on the\nhills, and that you tried to go to her, and it distressed her very much.\nBut she will forgive you when I have told her how great your love is,\nthat the desire to look on her face made you forget how wrong it was to\napproach her.\"\n\nHow strange and incomprehensible it seemed that Edra had so\nmisinterpreted my feeling! It seemed also to me that they all, from the\nfather of the house downwards, were very blind indeed to set down so\nstrong an emotion to mere brotherly affection. I had wished, yet feared,\nto remove the scales from their eyes; and now, in an unguarded moment, I\nhad made the attempt, and my gentle confessor had failed to understand\nme. Nevertheless, I extracted some comfort from this conversation; for\nYoletta would know how greatly my love exceeded that of her own kindred,\nand I hoped against hope that a responsive emotion would at last awaken\nin her breast.\n\nWhen the last of those leaden-footed thirty days arrived--the day on\nwhich, according to my computation, Yoletta would recover liberty before\nthe sun set--I rose early from the straw pallet where I had tossed all\nnight, prevented from sleeping by the prospect of reunion, and the fever\nof impatience I was in. The cold river revived me, and when we were\nassembled in the breakfast-room I observed Edra watching me, with a\ncurious, questioning smile on her lips. I asked her the reason.\n\n\"You are like a person suddenly recovered from sickness,\" she replied.\n\"Your eyes sparkle like sunshine on the water, and your cheeks that were\nso pallid yesterday burn redder than an autumn leaf.\" Then, smiling, she\nadded these precious words: \"Yoletta will be glad to return to us, more\non your account than her own.\"\n\nAfter we had broken our fast, I determined to go to the forest and spend\nthe day there. For many days past I had shirked woodcutting; but now it\nseemed impossible for me to settle down to any quiet, sedentary kind of\nwork, the consuming impatience and boundless energy I felt making me\nwish for some unusually violent task, such as would exhaust the body and\ngive, perhaps, a rest to the mind. Taking my ax, and the usual small\nbasket of provisions for my noonday meal, I left the house; and on this\nmorning I did not walk, but ran as if for a wager, taking long, flying\nleaps over bushes and streams that had never tempted me before. Arrived\nat the scene of action, I selected a large tree which had been marked\nout for felling, and for hours I hacked at it with an energy almost\nsuperhuman; and at last, before I had felt any disposition to rest, the\ntowering old giant, bowing its head and rustling its sere foliage as if\nin eternal farewell to the skies, came with a mighty crash to the earth.\nScarcely was it fallen before I felt that I had labored too long and\nviolently: the dry, fresh breeze stung my burning cheeks like needles of\nice, my knees trembled under me, and the whole world seemed to spin\nround; then, casting myself upon a bed of chips and withered leaves, I\nlay gasping for breath, with only life enough left in me to wonder\nwhether I had fainted or not. Recovered at length from this exhausted\ncondition, I sat up, and rejoiced to observe that half the day--that\nlast miserable day--had already flown. Then the thoughts of the\napproaching evening, and all the happiness it would bring, inspired me\nwith fresh zeal and strength, and, starting to my feet, and taking no\nthought of my food, I picked up the ax and made a fresh onslaught on the\nfallen tree. I had already accomplished more than a day's work, but the\nfever in my blood and brain urged me on to the arduous task of lopping\noff the huge branches; and my exertions did not cease until once more\nthe world, with everything on it, began revolving like a whirligig,\ncompelling me to desist and take a still longer rest. And sitting there\nI thought only of Yoletta. How would she look after that long seclusion?\nPale, and sad too perhaps; and her sweet, soulful eyes--oh, would I now\nsee in them that new light for which I had watched and waited so long?\n\nThen, while I thus mused, I heard, not far off, a slight rustling sound,\nas of a hare startled at seeing me, and bounding away over the withered\nleaves; and lifting up my eyes from the ground, I beheld Yoletta herself\nhastening towards me, her face shining with joy. I sprang forward to\nmeet her, and in another moment she was locked in my arms. That one\nmoment of unspeakable happiness seemed to out-weigh a hundred times all\nthe misery I had endured. \"Oh, my sweet darling--at last, at last, my\npain is ended!\" I murmured, while pressing her again and again to my\nheart, and kissing that dear face, which looked now so much thinner than\nwhen I had last seen it.\n\nShe bent back her head, like Genevieve in the ballad, to look me in the\nface, her eyes filled with tears--crystal, happy drops, which dimmed not\ntheir brightness. But her face was pale, with a pensive pallor like that\nof the _Gloire de Dijon_ rose; only now excitement had suffused her\ncheeks with the tints of that same rose--that red so unlike the bloom on\nother faces in vanished days; so tender and delicate and precious above\nall tints in nature!\n\n\"I know,\" she spoke, \"how you were grieving for me, that you were pale\nand dejected. Oh, how strange you should love me so much!\"\n\n\"Strange, darling--that word again! It is the one sweetness and joy of\nlife. And are you not glad to be loved?\"\n\n\"Oh, I cannot tell you how glad; but am I not here in your arms to show\nit? When I heard that you had gone to the wood I did not wait, but ran\nhere as fast as I could. Do you remember that evening on the hill, when\nyou vexed me with questions, and I could not understand your words? Now,\nwhen I love you so much more, I can understand them better. Tell me,\nhave I not done as you wished, and given myself to you, body and soul?\nHow thirty days have changed you! Oh, Smith, do you love me so much?\"\n\n\"I love you so much, dear, that if you were to die, there would be no\nmore pleasure in life for me, and I should prefer to lie near you\nunderground. All day long I am thinking of you, and when I sleep you are\nin all ray dreams.\"\n\nShe still continued gazing into my face, those happy tears still shining\nin her eyes, listening to my words; but alas! on that sweet, beautiful\nface, so full of changeful expression, there was not the expression I\nsought, and no sign of that maidenly shame which gave to Genevieve in\nthe ballad such an exquisite grace in her lover's eyes.\n\n\"I also had dreams of you,\" she answered. \"They came to me after Edra\nhad told me how pale and sad you had grown.\"\n\n\"Tell me one of your dreams, darling.\"\n\n\"I dreamed that I was lying awake on my bed, with the moon shining on\nme; I was cold, and crying bitterly because I had been left so long\nalone. All at once I saw you standing at my side in the moonlight. 'Poor\nYoletta,' you said, 'your tears have chilled you like winter rain.' Then\nyou kissed them dry, and when you had put your arms about me, I drew\nyour face against my bosom, and rested warm and happy in your love.\"\n\nOh, how her delicious words maddened me! Even my tongue and lips\nsuddenly became dry as ashes with the fever in me, and could only\nwhisper huskily when I strove to answer. I released her from my arms and\nsat down on the fallen tree, all my blissful raptures turned to a great\ndespondence. Would it always be thus--would she continue to embrace me,\nand speak words that simulated passion while no such feeling touched her\nheart? Such a state of things could not endure, and my passion, mocked\nand baffled again and again, would rend me to pieces, and hurl me on to\nmadness and self-destruction. For how many men had been driven by love\nto such an end, and the women they had worshiped, and miserably died\nfor, compared with Yoletta, were like creatures of clay compared with\none of the immortals. And was she not a being of a higher order than\nmyself? It was folly to think otherwise. But how had mortals always\nfared when they aspired to mate with celestials? I tried then to\nremember something bearing on this important point, but my mind was\nbecoming strangely confused. I closed my eyes to think, and presently\nopening them again, saw Yoletta kneeling before me, gazing up into my\nface with an alarmed expression.\n\n\"What is the matter, Smith, you seem ill?\" she said; and then, laying\nher fresh palm on my forehead, added: \"Your head burns like fire.\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" I returned. \"I'm worrying my brains trying to remember all\nabout them. What were their names, and what did they do to those who\nloved them--can't you tell me?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are ill--you have a fever and may die!\" she exclaimed, throwing\nher arms about my neck and pressing her cheek to mine.\n\nI felt a strange imbecility of mind, yet it seemed to anger me to be\ntold that I was ill. \"I am not ill,\" I protested feebly. \"I never felt\nbetter in my life! But can't you answer me--who were they, and what did\nthey do? Tell me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\nShe started up, and taking the small metal whistle hanging at her side,\nblew a shrill note that seemed to pierce my brain like a steel weapon. I\ntried to get up from my seat on the trunk, but only slipped down to the\nground. A dull mist and gloom seemed to be settling down on everything;\ndaylight, and hope with it, was fast forsaking the world. But something\nwas coming to us--out of that universal mist and darkness closing around\nus it came bounding swiftly through the wood--a huge gray wolf! No, not\na wolf--a wolf was nothing to it! A mighty, roaring lion crashing\nthrough the forest; a monster ever increasing in size, vast and of\nhorrible aspect, surpassing all monsters of the imagination--all beasts,\ngigantic and deformed, that had ever existed in past geologic ages; a\nlion with teeth like elephants' tusks, its head clothed as with a black\nthunder-cloud, through which its eyes glared like twin, blood-red suns!\nAnd she--my love--with a cry on her lips, was springing forth to meet\nit--lost, lost for ever! I struggled frantically to rise and fly to her\nassistance, and rose, after many efforts, to my knees, only to fall\nagain to the earth, insensible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\nThe violent fever into which I had fallen did not abate until the third\nday, when I fell into a profound slumber, from which I woke refreshed\nand saved. I did not, on awakening, find myself in my own familiar cell,\nbut in a spacious apartment new to me, on a comfortable bed, beside\nwhich Edra was seated. Almost my first feeling was one of disappointment\nat not seeing Yoletta there, and presently I began to fear that in the\nravings of delirium I had spoken things which had plucked the scales\nfrom the eyes of my kind friends in a very rough way indeed, and that\nthe being I loved best had been permanently withdrawn from my sight. It\nwas a blessed relief when Edra, in answer to the questions I put with\nsome heart-quakings to her, informed me that I had talked a great deal\nin my fever, but unintelligibly, continually asking questions about\nVenus, Diana, Juno, and many other persons whose names had never before\nbeen heard in the house. How fortunate that my crazy brain had thus\ncontinued vexing itself with this idle question! She also told me that\nYoletta had watched day and night at my side, that at last, when the\nfever left me, and I had fallen into that cooling slumber, she too, with\nher hand on mine, had dropped her head on the pillow and fallen asleep.\nThen, without waking her, they had carried her away to her own room, and\nEdra had taken her place by my side.\n\n\"Have you nothing more to ask?\" she said at length, with an accent of\nsurprise.\n\n\"No; nothing more. What you have told me has made me very happy--what\nmore can I wish to know?\"\n\n\"But there is more to tell you, Smith. We know now that your illness is\nthe result of your own imprudence; and as soon as you are well enough to\nleave your room and bear it, you must suffer the punishment.\"\n\n\"What! Punished for being ill!\" I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright in my\nbed. \"What do you mean, Edra? I never heard such outrageous nonsense in\nmy life!\"\n\nShe was disturbed at this outburst, but quietly and gravely repeated\nthat I must certainly be punished for my illness.\n\nRemembering what their punishments were, I had the prospect of a second\nlong separation from Yoletta, and the thought of such excessive\nseverity, or rather of such cruel injustice, made me wild. \"By Heaven, I\nshall not submit to it!\" I exclaimed. \"Punished for being ill--who ever\nheard of such a thing! I suppose that by-and-by it will be discovered\nthat the bridge of my nose is not quite straight, or that I can't see\nround the corner, and that also will be set down as a crime, to be\nexpiated in solitary confinement, on a bread-and-water diet! No, you\nshall not punish me; rather than give in to such tyranny I'll walk off\nand leave the house for ever!\"\n\nShe regarded me with an expression almost approaching to horror on her\ngentle face, and for some moments made no reply. Then I remembered that\nif I carried out that insane threat I should indeed lose Yoletta, and\nthe very thought of such a loss was more than I could endure; and for a\nmoment I almost hated the love which made me so helpless and\nmiserable--so powerless to oppose their stupid and barbarous practices.\nIt would have been sweet then to have felt free--free to fling them a\ncurse, and go away, shaking the dust of their house from my shoes,\nsupposing that any dust had adhered to them.\n\nThen Edra began to speak again, and gravely and sorrowfully, but without\na touch of austerity in her tone or manner, censured me for making use\nof such irrational language, and for allowing bitter, resentful thoughts\nto enter my heart. But the despondence and sullen rage into which I had\nbeen thrown made me proof even against the medicine of an admonition\nimparted so gently, and, turning my face away, I stubbornly refused to\nmake any reply. For a while she was silent, but I misjudged her when I\nimagined that she would now leave me, offended, to my own reflections.\n\n\"Do you not know that you are giving me pain?\" she said at last, drawing\na little closer to me. \"A little while ago you told me that you loved\nme: has that feeling faded so soon, or do you take any pleasure in\nwounding those you love?\"\n\nHer words, and, more than her words, her tender, pleading tone, pierced\nme with compunction, and I could not resist. \"Edra, my sweet sister, do\nnot imagine such a thing!\" I said. \"I would rather endure many\npunishments than give you pain. My love for you cannot fade while I have\nlife and understanding. It is in me like greenness in the leaf--that\nbeautiful color which can only be changed by sere decay.\"\n\nShe smiled forgiveness, and with a humid brightness in her eyes, which\nsomehow made me think of that joy of the angels over one sinner that\nrepenteth, bent down and touched her lips to mine. \"How can you love any\none more than that, Smith?\" she said. \"Yet you say that your love for\nYoletta exceeds all others.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, exceeds all others, as the light of the sun exceeds that of\nthe moon and the stars. Can you not understand that--has no man ever\nloved you with a love like that, my sister?\"\n\nShe shook her head and sighed. Did she not understand my meaning\nnow--had not my words brought back some sweet and sorrowful memory? With\nher hands folded idly on her lap, and her face half averted, she sat\ngazing at nothing. It seemed impossible that this woman, so tender and\nso beautiful, should never have experienced in herself or witnessed in\nanother, the feeling I had questioned her about. But she made no further\nreply to my words; and as I lay there watching her, the drowsy spirit\nthe fever had left in me overcame my brain, and I slept once more.\n\nFor several days, which brought me so little strength that I was not\npermitted to leave the sick-room, I heard nothing further about my\npunishment, for I purposely refrained from asking any questions, and no\nperson appeared inclined to bring forward so disagreeable a subject. At\nlength I was pronounced well enough to go about the house, although\nstill very feeble, and I was conducted, not to the judgment-room, where\nI had expected to be taken, but to the Mother's Room; and there I found\nthe father of the house, seated with Chastel, and with them seven or\neight of the others. They all welcomed me, and seemed glad to see me out\nagain; but I could not help remarking a certain subdued, almost solemn\nair about them, which seemed to remind me that I was regarded as an\noffender already found guilty, who had now been brought up to receive\njudgment.\n\n\"My son,\" said the father, addressing me in a calm, judicial tone which\nat once put my last remaining hopes to flight, \"it is a consolation to\nus to know that your offense is of such a nature that it cannot diminish\nour esteem for you, or loosen the bonds of affection which unite you to\nus. You are still feeble, and perhaps a little confused in mind\nconcerning the events of the last few days: I do not therefore press you\nto give an account of them, but shall simply state your offense, and if\nI am mistaken in any particular you shall correct me. The great love you\nhave for Yoletta,\" he continued--and at this I started and blushed\npainfully, but the succeeding words served to show that I had only too\nlittle cause for alarm--\"the great love you have for Yoletta caused you\nmuch suffering during her thirty days' seclusion from us, so that you\nlost all enjoyment of life, and eating little, and being in continual\ndejection, your strength was much diminished. On the last day you were\nso much excited at the prospect of reunion with her, that you went to\nyour task in the woods almost fasting, and probably after spending a\nrestless night. Tell me if this is not so?\"\n\n\"I did not sleep that night,\" I replied, somewhat huskily.\n\n\"Unrefreshed by sleep and with lessened strength,\" he continued, \"you\nwent to the woods, and in order to allay that excitement in your mind,\nyou labored with such energy that by noon you had accomplished a task\nwhich, in another and calmer condition of mind and body, would have\noccupied you more than one day. In thus acting you had already been\nguilty of a serious offense against yourself; but even then you might\nhave escaped the consequences if, after finishing your work, you had\nrested and refreshed yourself with food and drink. This, however, you\nneglected to do; for when you had fallen insensible to the earth, and\nYoletta had called the dog and sent it to the house to summon\nassistance, the food you had taken with you was found untasted in the\nbasket. Your life was thus placed in great peril; and although it is\ngood to lay life down when it has become a burden to ourselves and\nothers, being darkened by that failure of power from which there is no\nrecovery, wantonly or carelessly to endanger it in the flower of its\nstrength and beauty is a great folly and a great offense. Consider how\ndeep our grief would have been, especially the grief of Yoletta, if this\nculpable disregard of your own safety and well-being had ended fatally,\nas it came so near ending! It is therefore just and righteous that an\noffense of such a nature should be recompensed; but it is a light\noffense, not like one committed against the house, or even against\nanother person, and we also remember the occasion of it, since it was no\nunworthy motive, but exceeding love, which clouded your judgment, and\ntherefore, taking all these things into account, it was my intention to\nput you away from us for the space of thirteen days.\"\n\nHere he paused, as if expecting me to make some reply. He had reproved\nme so gently, even approving of the emotion, although still entirely in\nthe dark as to its meaning, which had caused my illness, that I was made\nto feel very submissive, and even grateful to him.\n\n\"It is only just,\" I replied, \"that I should suffer for my fault, and\nyou have tempered justice with more mercy than I deserve.\"\n\n\"You speak with the wisdom of a chastened spirit, my son,\" he said,\nrising and placing his hand on my head; \"and your words gladden me all\nthe more for knowing that you were filled with surprise and resentment\nwhen told that your offense was one deserving punishment. And now, my\nson, I have to tell you that you will not be separated from us, for the\nmother of the house has willed that your offense shall be pardoned.\"\n\nI looked in surprise at Chastel, for this was very unexpected: she was\ngazing at my face with the light of a strange tenderness in her eyes,\nnever seen there before. She extended her hand, and, kneeling before\nher, I took it in mine and raised it to my lips, and tried, with poor\nsuccess, to speak my thanks for this rare and beautiful act of mercy.\nThen the others surrounded me to express their congratulations, the men\npressing my hands, but not so the women, for they all freely kissed me;\nbut when Yoletta, coming last, put her white arms about my neck and\npressed her lips to mine, the ecstasy I felt was so greatly overbalanced\nby the pain of my position, and the thought, now almost a conviction,\nthat I was powerless to enlighten them with regard to the nature of the\nlove I felt for her, that I almost shrank from her dear embrace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\nMy attack of illness, although sharp, had passed off so quickly that I\nconfidently looked to complete restoration to my former vigorous state\nof health in a very short time. Nevertheless, many days went by, and I\nfailed to recover strength, but remained pretty much in that condition\nof body in which I had quitted the sick-room. This surprised and\ndistressed me at first, but in a little time I began to get reconciled\nto such a state, and even to discover that it had certain advantages,\nthe chief of which was that the tumult of my mind was over for a season,\nso that I craved for nothing very eagerly. My friends advised me to do\nno work; but not wishing to eat the bread of idleness--although the\nbread was little now, as I had little appetite--I made it a rule to go\nevery morning to the workhouse, and occupy myself for two or three hours\nwith some light, mechanical task which put no strain on me, physical or\nmental. Even this playing at work fatigued me. Then, after changing my\ndress, I would repair to the music-room to resume my search after hidden\nknowledge in any books that happened to be there; for I could read now,\na result which my sweet schoolmistress had been the first to see, and at\nonce she had abandoned the lessons I had loved so much, leaving me to\nwander at will, but without a guide, in that wilderness of a strange\nliterature. I had never been to the library, and did not even know in\nwhat part of the house it was situated; nor had I ever expressed a wish\nto see it. And that for two reasons: one was, that I had already\nhalf-resolved--my resolutions were usually of that complexion--never to\nrun the risk of appearing desirous of knowing too much; the other and\nweightier reason was, that I had never loved libraries. They oppress me\nwith a painful sense of my mental inferiority; for all those tens of\nthousands of volumes, containing so much important but unappreciated\nmatter, seem to have a kind of collective existence, and to look down on\nme, like a man with great, staring, owlish eyes, as an intruder on\nsacred ground--a barbarian, whose proper place is in the woods. It is a\nmere fancy, I know, but it distresses me, and I prefer not to put myself\nin the way of it. Once in a book I met with a scornful passage about\npeople with \"bodily constitutions like those of horses, and small\nbrains,\" which made me blush painfully; but in the very next passage the\nwriter makes amends, saying that a man ought to think himself well off\nif, in the lottery of life, he draws the prize of a healthy stomach\nwithout a mind, that it is better than a fine intellect with a crazy\nstomach. I had drawn the healthy stomach--liver, lungs, and heart to\nmatch--and had never felt dissatisfied with my prize. Now, however, it\nseemed expedient that I should give some hours each day to reading; for\nso far my conversations and close intimacy with the people of the house\nhad not dissipated the cloud of mystery in which their customs were hid;\nand by customs I here refer to those relating to courtship and matrimony\nonly, for that was to me the main thing. The books I read, or dipped\ninto, were all highly interesting, especially the odd volumes I looked\nat belonging to that long series on the _Houses of the World_, for\nthese abounded in marvelous and entertaining matter. There were also\nhistories of the house, and works on arts, agriculture, and various\nother subjects, but they were not what I wanted. After three or four\nhours spent in these fruitless researches, I would proceed to the\nMother's Room, where I was now permitted to enter freely every\nafternoon, and when there, to remain as long as I wished. It was so\npleasant that I soon dropped into the custom of remaining until\nsupper-time compelled me to leave it, Chastel invariably treating me now\nwith a loving tenderness of manner which seemed strange when I recalled\nthe extremely unfavorable impression I had made at our first interview.\n\nIt was never my nature to be indolent, or to love a quiet, dreamy\nexistence: on the contrary, my fault had lain in the opposite direction,\nunlimited muscular exercise being as necessary to my well-being as fresh\nair and good food, and the rougher the exercise the better I liked it.\nBut now, in this novel condition of languor, I experienced a wonderful\nrestfulness both of body and mind, and in the Mother's Room, resting as\nif some weariness of labor still clung to me, breathing and steeped in\nthat fragrant, summer-like atmosphere, I had long intervals of perfect\ninactivity and silence, while I sat or reclined, not thinking but in a\nreverie, while many dreams of pleasures to come drifted in a vague,\nvaporous manner through my brain. The very character of the room--its\ndelicate richness, the exquisitely harmonious disposition of colors and\nobjects, and the illusions of nature produced on the mind--seemed to\nlend itself to this unaccustomed mood, and to confirm me in it.\n\nThe first impression produced was one of brightness: coming to it by way\nof the long, dim sculpture gallery was like passing out into the open\nair, and this effect was partly due to the white and crystal surfaces\nand the brilliancy of the colors where any color appeared. It was\nspacious and lofty, and the central arched or domed portion of the roof,\nwhich was of a light turquoise blue, rested on graceful columns of\npolished crystal. The doors were of amber-colored glass set in agate\nframes; but the windows, eight in number, formed the principal\nattraction. On the glass, hill and mountain scenery was depicted, the\nsummits in some of them appearing beyond wide, barren plains, whitened\nwith the noonday splendor and heat of midsummer, untempered by a cloud,\nthe soaring peaks showing a pearly luster which seemed to remove them to\nan infinite distance. To look out, as it were, from the imitation shade\nof such an arbor, or pavilion, over those far-off, sun-lit expanses\nwhere the light appeared to dance and quiver as one gazed, was a\nnever-failing delight. Such was its effect on me, combined with that of\nthe mother's new tender graciousness, resulting I knew not whether from\ncompassion or affection, that I could have wished to remain a permanent\ninvalid in her room.\n\nAnother cause of the mild kind of happiness I now experienced was the\nconsciousness of a change in my own mental disposition, which made me\nless of an alien in the house; for I was now able, I imagined, to\nappreciate the beautiful character of my friends, their crystal purity\nof heart and the religion they professed. Far back in the old days I had\nheard, first and last, a great deal about sweetness and light and\nPhilistines, and not quite knowing what this grand question was all\nabout, and hearing from some of my friends that I was without the\nqualities they valued most, I thereafter proclaimed myself a Philistine,\nand was satisfied to have the controversy ended in that way, so far as\nit concerned me personally. Now, however, I was like one to whom some\nimportant thing has been told, who, scarcely hearing and straightway\nforgetting, goes about his affairs; but, lying awake at night in the\nsilence of his chamber, recalls the unheeded words and perceives their\nfull significance. My sojourn with this people--angelic women and\nmild-eyed men with downy, unrazored lips, so mild in manner yet in their\narts \"laying broad bases for eternity\"--above all the invalid hours\nspent daily in the Mother's Room, had taught me how unlovely a creature\nI had been. It would have been strange indeed if, in such an atmosphere,\nI had not absorbed a little sweetness and light into my system.\n\nIn this sweet refuge--this slumberous valley where I had been cast up by\nthat swift black current that had borne me to an immeasurable distance\non its bosom, and with such a change going on within me--I sometimes\nthought that a little more and I would touch that serene, enduring bliss\nwhich seemed to be the normal condition of my fellow-inmates. My passion\nfor Yoletta now burned with a gentle flame, which did not consume, but\nonly imparted an agreeable sense of warmth to the system. When she was\nthere, sitting with me at her mother's feet, sometimes so near that her\ndark, shining hair brushed against my cheek, and her fragrant breath\ncame on my face; and when she caressed my hand, and gazed full at me\nwith those dear eyes that had no shadow of regret or anxiety in them,\nbut only unfathomable love, I could imagine that our union was already\ncomplete, that she was altogether and eternally mine.\n\nI knew that this could not continue. Sometimes I could not prevent my\nthoughts from flying away from the present; then suddenly the complexion\nof my dream would change, darkening like a fair landscape when a cloud\nobscures the sun. Not forever would the demon of passion slumber and\ndream in my breast; with recovered strength it would wake again, and,\never increasing in power and ever baffled of its desire, would raise\nonce more that black tempest of that past to overwhelm me. Other darker\nvisions followed: I would see myself as in a magic glass, lying with\nupturned, ghastly face, with many people about me, hurrying to and fro,\nwringing their hands and weeping aloud with grief, shuddering at the\nabhorred sight of blood on their sacred, shining floors; or, worse\nstill, I saw myself shivering in sordid rags and gaunt with long-lasting\nfamine, a fugitive in some wintry, desolate land, far from all human\ncompanionship, the very image of Yoletta scorched by madness to formless\nashes in my brain; and for all sensations, feelings, memories, thoughts,\nnothing left to me but a distorted likeness of the visible world, and a\nterrible unrest urging me, as with a whip of scorpions, ever on and on,\nto ford yet other black, icy torrents, and tear myself bleeding through\nyet other thorny thickets, and climb the ramparts of yet other gigantic,\nbarren hills.\n\nBut these moments of terrible depression, new to my life, were\ninfrequent, and seldom lasted long. Chastel was my good angel; a word, a\ntouch from her hand, and the ugly spirits would vanish. She appeared to\npossess a mysterious faculty--perhaps only the keen insight and sympathy\nof a highly spiritualized nature--which informed her of much that was\npassing in my heart: if a shadow came there when she had no wish or\nstrength to converse, she would make me draw close to her seat, and rest\nher hand on mine, and the shadow would pass from me.\n\nI could not help reflecting often and wonderingly at this great change\nin her manner towards me. Her eyes dwelt lovingly on me, and her keenest\nsuffering, and the unfortunate blundering expressions I frequently let\nfall, seemed equally powerless to wring one harsh or impatient word from\nher. I was not now only one among her children, privileged to come and\nsit at her feet, to have with them a share in her impartial affection;\nand remembering that I was a stranger in the house, and compared but\npoorly with the others, the undisguised preference she showed for me,\nand the wish to have me almost constantly with her, seemed a great\nmystery.\n\nOne afternoon, as I sat alone with her, she made the remark that my\nreading lessons had ceased.\n\n\"Oh yes, I can read perfectly well now,\" I answered. \"May I read to you\nfrom this book?\" Saying which, I put my hand towards a volume lying on\nthe couch at her side. It differed from the other books I had seen, in\nits smaller size and blue binding.\n\n\"No, not in this book,\" she said, with a shade of annoyance in her\nvoice, putting out her hand to prevent my taking it.\n\n\"Have I made another mistake?\" I asked, withdrawing my hand. \"I am very\nignorant.\"\n\n\"Yes, poor boy, you are very ignorant,\" she returned, placing her hand\non my forehead. \"You must know that this is a mother's book, and only a\nmother may read in it.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" I said, with a sigh, \"that it will be a long time before\nI cease to offend you with such mistakes.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion to say that, for you have not offended me, only\nyou make me feel sorry. Every day when you are with me I try to teach\nyou something, to smooth the path for you; but you must remember, my\nson, that others cannot feel towards you as I do, and it may come to\npass that they will sometimes be offended with you, because their love\nis less than mine.\"\n\n\"But why do you care so much for me?\" I asked, emboldened by her words.\n\"Once I thought that you only of all in the house would never love me:\nwhat has changed your feelings towards me, for I know that they have\nchanged?\" She looked at me, smiling a little sadly, but did not reply.\n\"I think I should be happier for knowing,\" I resumed, caressing her\nhand. \"Will you not tell me?\"\n\nThere was a strange trouble on her face as her eyes glanced away and\nthen returned to mine again, while her lips quivered, as if with\nunspoken words. Then she answered: \"No, I cannot tell you now. It would\nmake you happy, perhaps, but the proper time has not yet arrived. You\nmust be patient, and learn, for you have much to learn. It is my desire\nthat you should know all those things concerning the family of which you\nare ignorant, and when I say all, I mean not only those suitable to one\nin your present condition, as a son of the house, but also those higher\nmatters which belong to the heads of the house--to the father and\nmother.\"\n\nThen, casting away all caution, I answered: \"It is precisely a knowledge\nof those greater matters concerning the family which I have been\nhungering after ever since I came into the house.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" she returned. \"This hunger you speak of was partly the\ncause of your fever, and it is in you, keeping you feverish and feeble\nstill; but for this, instead of being a prisoner here, you would now be\nabroad, feeling the sun and wind on your face.\"\n\n\"And if you know that,\" I pleaded, \"why do you not now impart the\nknowledge that can make me whole? For surely, all those lesser\nmatters--those things suitable for one in my condition to know--can be\nlearned afterwards, in due time. For they are not of pressing\nimportance, but the other is to me a matter of life and death, if you\nonly knew it.\"\n\n\"I know everything,\" she returned quickly. But a cloud had come over her\nface at my concluding words, and a startled look into her eyes. \"Life\nand death! do you know what you are saying?\" she exclaimed, fixing her\neyes on me with such intense earnestness in them that mine fell abashed\nbefore their gaze. Then, after a while, she drew my head down against\nher knees, and spoke with a strange tenderness. \"Do you then find it so\nhard to exercise a little patience, my son, that you do not acquiesce in\nwhat I say to you, and fear to trust your future in my hands? My time is\nshort for all that I have to do, yet I also must be patient and wait,\nalthough for me it is hardest. For now your coming, which I did not\nregard at first, seeing in you only a pilgrim like others--one who\nthrough accidents of travel had been cast away and left homeless in the\nworld, until we found and gave you shelter--now, it has brought\nsomething new into my life: and if this fresh hope, which is only an\nold, perished hope born again, ever finds fulfillment, then death will\nlose much of its bitterness. But there are difficulties in the way which\nonly time, and the energy of a soul that centers all its faculties in\none desire, one enterprise, can overcome. And the chief difficulty I\nfind is in yourself--in that strange, untoward disposition so often\nrevealed in your conversation, which you have shown even now; for to be\nthus questioned and pressed, and to have my judgment doubted, would have\ngreatly offended me in another. Remember this, and do not abuse the\nprivilege you enjoy: remember that you must greatly change before I can\nshare with you the secrets of my heart that concern you. And bear in\nmind, my son, that I am not rebuking you for a want of knowledge; for I\nknow that for many deficiencies you are not blameworthy. I know, for\ninstance, that nature has denied to you that melodious and flexible\nvoice in which it is our custom every day to render homage to the\nFather, to express all the sacred feelings of our hearts, all our love\nfor each other, the joy we have in life, and even our griefs and\nsorrows. For grief is like a dark, oppressive cloud, until from lip and\nhand it breaks in the rain of melody, and we are lightened, so that even\nthe things that are painful give to life a new and chastened glory. And\nas with music, so with all other arts. There is a twofold pleasure in\ncontemplating our Father's works: in the first and lower kind you share\nwith us; but the second and more noble, springing from the first, is\nours through that faculty by means of which the beauty and harmony of\nthe visible world become transmuted in the soul, which is like a pencil\nof glass receiving the white sunbeam into itself, and changing it to\nred, green, and violet-colored light: thus nature transmutes itself in\nour minds, and is expressed in art. But in you this second faculty is\nwanting, else you would not willingly forego so great a pleasure as its\nexercise affords, and love nature like one that loves his fellow-man,\nbut has no words to express so sweet a feeling. For the happiness of\nlove with sympathy, when made known and returned, is increased an\nhundredfold; and in all artistic work we commune not with blind,\nirrational nature, but with the unseen spirit which is in nature,\ninspiring our hearts, returning love for love, and rewarding our labor\nwith enduring bliss. Therefore it is your misfortune, not your fault,\nthat you are deprived of this supreme solace and happiness.\"\n\nTo this speech, which had a depressing effect on me, I answered sadly:\n\"Every day I feel my deficiencies more keenly, and wish more ardently to\nlessen the great distance between us; but now--sweet mother, forgive me\nfor saying it!--your words almost make me despond.\"\n\n\"And yet, my son, I have spoken only to encourage you. I know your\nlimitations, and expect nothing beyond your powers; nor do your errors\ngreatly trouble me, believing as I do that in time you will be able to\ndismiss them from your mind. But the temper of your mind must be changed\nto be worthy of the happiness I have designed for you. Patience must\nchasten that reckless spirit in you; for feverish diligence, alternating\nwith indifference or despondence, there must be unremitting effort; and\nfor that unsteady flame of hope, which burns so brightly in the morning\nand in the evening sings so low, there must be a bright, unwavering, and\nrational hope. It would be strange indeed if after this you were cast\ndown; and, lest you forget anything, I will say again that only by\ngiving you enduring happiness and the desire of your heart can my one\nhope be fulfilled. Consider how much I say to you in these words; it\nsaddens me to think that so much was necessary. And do not think hardly\nof me, my son, for wishing to keep you a little longer in this prison\nwith me: for in a little while your weakness will pass away like a\nmorning cloud. But for me there shall come no change, since I must\nremain day and night here with the shadow of death; and when I am taken\nforth, and the sunshine falls once more on my face, I shall not feel it,\nand shall not see it, and I shall lie forgotten when you are in the\nmidst of your happy years.\"\n\nHer words smote on my heart with a keen pain of compassion. \"Do not say\nthat you will be forgotten!\" I exclaimed passionately; \"for should you\nbe taken away, I shall still love and worship your memory, as I worship\nyou now when you are alive.\"\n\nShe caressed my hand, but did not speak; and when I looked up, her worn\nface had dropped on the pillow, and her eyes were closed. \"I am\ntired--tired,\" she murmured. \"Stay with me a little longer, but leave me\nif I sleep.\"\n\nAnd in a little while she slept. The light was on her face, resting on\nthe purple pillow, and with the soulful eyes closed, and the lips that\nhad no red color of life in them also closed and motionless, it was like\na face carved in ivory of one who had suffered like Isarte in the house\nand perished long generations ago; and the abundant dark, lusterless\nhair that framed it, looked dead too, and of the color of wrought iron.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\nChastel's words sank deep in my heart--deeper than words had ever sunk\nbefore into that somewhat unpromising soil; and although she had\npurposely left me in the dark with regard to many important matters, I\nnow resolved to win her esteem, and bind her yet more closely to me by\ncorrecting those faults in my character she had pointed out with so much\ntenderness.\n\nAlas! the very next day was destined to bring me a sore trouble. On\nentering the breakfast-room I became aware that a shadow had fallen on\nthe house. Among his silent people the father sat with gray, haggard\nface and troubled eyes; then Yoletta entered, her sweet face looking\npaler than when I had first seen it after her long punishment, while\nunder her heavy, drooping eyelids her skin was stained with that\nmournful purple which tells of a long vigil and a heart oppressed with\nanxiety. I heard with profound concern that Chastel's malady had\nsuddenly become aggravated; that she had passed the night in the\ngreatest suffering. What would become of me, and of all those bright\ndreams of happiness, if she were to die? was my first idea. But at the\nsame time I had the grace to feel ashamed of that selfish thought.\nNevertheless, I could not shake off the gloom it had produced in me,\nand, too distressed in mind to work or read, I repaired to the Mother's\nRoom, to be as near as possible to the sufferer on whose recovery so\nmuch now depended. How lonely and desolate it seemed there, now that she\nwas absent! Those mountain landscapes, glowing with the white radiance\nof mimic sunshine, still made perpetual summer; yet there seemed to be a\nwintry chill and death-like atmosphere which struck to the heart, and\nmade me shiver with cold. The day dragged slowly to its close, and no\nrest came to the sufferer, nor sign of improvement to relieve our\nanxiety. Until past midnight I remained at my post, then retired for\nthree or four miserable, anxious hours, only to return once more when it\nwas scarcely light. Chastel's condition was still unchanged, or, if\nthere had been any change, it was for the worse, for she had not slept.\nAgain I remained, a prey to desponding thoughts, all day in the room;\nbut towards evening Yoletta came to take me to her mother. The summons\nso terrified me that for some moments I sat trembling and unable to\narticulate a word; for I could not but think that Chastel's end was\napproaching. Yoletta, however, divining the cause of my agitation,\nexplained that her mother could not sleep for torturing pains in her\nhead, and wished me to place my hand on her forehead, to try whether\nthat would cause any relief. This seemed to me a not very promising\nremedy; but she told me that on former occasions they had often\nsucceeded in procuring her ease by placing a hand on her forehead, and\nthat having failed now, Chastel had desired them to call me to her to\ntry my hand. I rose, and for the first time entered that sacred chamber,\nwhere Chastel was lying on a low bed placed on a slightly raised\nplatform in the center of the floor. In the dim light her face looked\nwhite as the pillow on which it rested, her forehead contracted with\nsharp pain, while low moans came at short intervals from her twitching\nlips; but her wide-open eyes were fixed on my face from the moment I\nentered the room, and to me they seemed to express mental anguish rather\nthan physical suffering. At the head of the bed sat the father, holding\nher hand in his; but when I entered he rose and made way for me,\nretiring to the foot of the bed, where two of the women were seated. I\nknelt beside the bed, and Yoletta raised and tenderly placed my right\nhand on the mother's forehead, and, after whispering to me to let it\nrest very gently there, she also withdrew a few paces.\n\nChastel did not speak, but for some minutes continued her low, piteous\nmoanings, only her eyes remained fixed on my face; and at last, becoming\nuneasy at her scrutiny, I said in a whisper: \"Dearest mother, do you\nwish to say anything to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, come nearer,\" she replied; and when I had bent my cheek close to\nher face, she continued: \"Do not fear, my son; I shall not die. I cannot\ndie until that of which I have spoken to you has been accomplished.\"\n\nI rejoiced at her words, yet, at the same time, they gave me pain; for\nit seemed as though she knew how much my heart had been troubled by that\nignoble fear.\n\n\"Dear mother, may I say something?\" I asked, wishing to tell her of my\nresolutions.\n\n\"Not now; I know what you wish to say,\" she returned. \"Be patient and\nhopeful always, and fear nothing, even though we should be long divided;\nfor it will be many days before I can leave this room to speak with you\nagain.\"\n\nSo softly had she whispered, that the others who stood so near were not\naware that she had spoken at all.\n\nAfter this brief colloquy she closed her eyes, but for some time the low\nmoans of pain continued. Gradually they sank lower, and became less and\nless frequent, while the lines of pain faded out of her white,\ndeath-like face. And at length Yoletta, stealing softly to my side,\nwhispered, \"She is sleeping,\" and withdrawing my hand, led me away.\n\nWhen we were again in the Mother's Room she threw her arms about my neck\nand burst into a tempest of tears.\n\n\"Dearest Yoletta, be comforted,\" I said, pressing her to my breast; \"she\nwill not die.\"\n\n\"Oh, Smith, how do you know?\" she returned quickly, looking up with her\neyes still shining with large drops.\n\nThen, of Chastel's whispered words to me, I repeated those four, \"I\nshall not die,\" but nothing more; they were however, a great relief to\nher, and her sweet, sorrowful face brightened like a drooping flower\nafter rain.\n\n\"Ah, she knew, then, that the touch of your hand would cause sleep, that\nsleep would save her,\" she said, smiling up at me.\n\n\"And you, my darling, how long is it since you closed those sweet\neyelids that seem so heavy?\"\n\n\"Not since I slept three nights ago.\"\n\n\"Will you sit by me here, resting your head on me, and sleep a little\nnow?\"\n\n\"Not there!\" she cried quickly. \"Not on the mother's couch. But if you\nwill sit here, it will be pleasant if I can sleep for a little while,\nresting on you.\"\n\nI placed myself on the low seat she led me to, and then, when she had\ncoiled herself up on the cushions, with her arms still round my neck,\nand her head resting on my bosom, she breathed a long happy sigh, and\ndropped like a tired child to sleep.\n\nHow perfect my happiness would have been then, with Yoletta in my arms,\nclasping her weary little ministering hands in mine, and tenderly\nkissing her dark, shining hair, but for the fear that some person might\ncome there to notice and disturb me. And pretty soon I was startled to\nsee the father himself coming from Chastel's chamber to us. Catching\nsight of me he paused, smiling, then advanced, and deliberately sat down\nby my side.\n\n\"This one is sleeping also,\" he said cheerfully, touching the girl's\nhair with his hand. \"But you need not fear, Smith; I think we shall be\nable to talk very well without waking her.\"\n\nI had feared something quite different, if he had only known it, and\nfelt considerably relieved by his words; nevertheless, I was not\nover-pleased at the prospect of a conversation just then, and should\nhave preferred being left alone with my precious burden.\n\n\"My son,\" he continued, placing a hand on my shoulder, \"I sometimes\nrecall, not without a smile, the effect your first appearance produced\non us, when we were startled at your somewhat grotesque pilgrim costume.\nYour attempts at singing, and ignorance of art generally, also impressed\nme unfavorably, and gave me some concern when I thought about the\nfuture--that is, _your_ future; for it seemed to me that you had\nbut slender foundations whereon to build a happy life. These doubts,\nhowever, no longer trouble me; for on several occasions you have shown\nus that you possess abundantly that richest of all gifts and safest\nguide to happiness--the capacity for deep affection. To this spirit of\nlove in you--this summer of the heart which causes it to blossom with\nbeautiful thoughts and deeds--I attribute your success just now, when\nthe contact of your hand produced the long-desired, refreshing slumber\nso necessary to the mother at this stage of her malady. I know that this\nis a mysterious thing; and it is commonly said that in such cases relief\nis caused by an emanation from the brain through the fingers. Doubtless\nthis is so; and I also choose to believe that only a powerful spirit of\nlove in the heart can rightly direct this subtle energy, that where such\na spirit is absent the desired effect cannot be produced.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" I replied. \"Great as my love and devotion is, I cannot\nsuppose it to equal, much less to surpass, that of others who yet failed\non this occasion to give relief.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; only that is looking merely at the surface of the matter, and\nleaving out of sight the unfathomable mysteries of a being compounded of\nflesh and spirit. There are among our best instruments peculiar to this\nhouse, especially those used chiefly in our harvest music, some of such\nfinely-tempered materials, and of so delicate a construction, that the\nperson wishing to perform on them must not only be inspired with the\nmelodious passion, but the entire system--body and soul--must be in the\nproper mood, the flesh itself elevated into harmony with the exalted\nspirit, else he will fail to elicit the tones or to give the expression\ndesired. This is a rough and a poor simile, when we consider how\nwonderful an instrument a human being is, with the body that burns with\nthought, and the spirit that quivers and cries with pain, and when we\nthink how its innumerable, complex chords may be injured and untuned by\nsuffering. The will may be ours, but something, we know not what,\ninterposes to defeat our best efforts. That you have succeeded in\nproducing so blessed a result, after we had failed, has served to deepen\nand widen in our hearts the love we already felt for you; for how much\nmore precious is this melody of repose, this sweet interval of relief\nfrom cruel pain the mother now experiences, than many melodies from\nclear voices and trained hands.\"\n\nIn my secret heart I believed that he was taking much too lofty a view\nof the matter; but I had no desire to argue against so flattering a\ndelusion, if it were one, and only wished that I could share it with\nhim.\n\n\"She is sleeping still,\" he said presently, \"perhaps without pain, like\nYoletta here, and her sleep will now probably last for some hours.\"\n\n\"I pray Heaven that she may wake refreshed and free from pain,\" I\nremarked.\n\nHe seemed surprised at my words, and looked searchingly into my face.\n\"My son,\" he said, \"it grieves me, at a moment like the present, to have\nto point out a great error to you; but it is an error hurtful to\nyourself and painful to those who see it, and if I were to pass it over\nin silence, or put off speaking of it to another time, I should not be\nfulfilling the part of a loving father towards you.\"\n\nSurprised at this speech, I begged him to tell me what I had said that\nwas wrong.\n\n\"Do you not then know that it is unlawful to entertain such a thought as\nyou have expressed?\" he said. \"In moments of supreme pain or bitterness\nor peril we sometimes so far forget ourselves as to cry out to Heaven to\nsave us or to give us ease; but to make any such petition when we are in\nthe full possession of our faculties is unworthy of a reasonable being,\nand an offense to the Father: for we pray to each other, and are moved\nby such prayers, remembering that we are fallible, and often err through\nhaste and forgetfulness and imperfect knowledge. But he who freely gave\nus life and reason and all good gifts, needs not that we should remind\nhim of anything; therefore to ask him to give us the thing we desire is\nto make him like ourselves, and charge him with an oversight; or worse,\nwe attribute weakness and irresolution to him, since the petitioner\nthinks my importunity to incline the balance in his favor.\"\n\nI was about to reply that I had always considered prayer to be an\nessential part of religion, and not of my form of religion only, but of\nall religions all over the world. Luckily I remembered in time that he\nprobably knew more about matters \"all over the world\" than I did, and so\nheld my tongue.\n\n\"Have you any doubts on the subject?\" he asked, after a while.\n\n\"I must confess that I still have some doubts,\" I replied. \"I believe\nthat our Creator and Father desires the happiness of all his creatures\nand takes no pleasure in seeing us miserable; for it would be impossible\nnot to believe it, seeing how greatly happiness overbalances misery in\nthe world. But he does not come to us in visible form to tell us in an\naudible voice that to cry out to him in sore pain and distress is\nunlawful. How, then, do we know this thing? For a child cries to its\nmother, and a fledgling in the nest to its parent bird; and he is\ninfinitely more to us than parent to child--infinitely stronger to help,\nand knows our griefs as no fellow-mortal can know them. May we not,\nthen, believe, without hurt to our souls, that the cry of one of his\nchildren in affliction may reach him; that in his compassion, and by\nmeans of his sovereign power over nature, he may give ease to the racked\nbody, and peace and joy to the desolate mind?\"\n\n\"You ask me, How, then, do we know this thing? and you answer the\nquestion yourself, yet fail to perceive that you answer it, when you say\nthat although he does not come in a visible form to teach us this thing\nand that thing, yet we know that he desires our happiness; and to this\nyou might have added a thousand or ten thousand other things which we\nknow. If the reason he gave us to start with makes it unnecessary that\nhe should come to tell us in an audible voice that he desires our\nhappiness, it must also surely suffice to tell us which are lawful and\nwhich unlawful of all the thoughts continually rising in our hearts.\nThat any one should question so evident and universally accepted a\ntruth, the foundation of all religion, seems very surprising to me. If\nit had consisted with his plan to make these delicate mortal bodies\ncapable of every agreeable sensation in the highest degree, yet not\nliable to accident, and not subject to misery and pain, he would surely\nhave done this for all of us. But reason and nature show us that such an\nend did not consist with his plan; therefore to ask him to suspend the\noperations of nature for the benefit of any individual sufferer, however\npoignant and unmerited the sufferings may be, is to shut our eyes to the\nonly light he has given us. All our highest and sweetest feelings unite\nwith reason to tell us with one voice that he loves us; and our\nknowledge of nature shows us plainly enough that he also loves all the\ncreatures inferior to man. To us he has given reason for a guide, and\nfor the guidance and protection of the lower kinds he has given\ninstinct: and though they do not know him, it would make us doubt his\nimpartial love for all his creatures, if we, by making use of our\nreason, higher knowledge, and articulate speech, were able to call down\nbenefits on ourselves, and avert pain and disaster, while the dumb,\nirrational brutes suffered in silence--the languishing deer that leaves\nthe herd with a festering thorn in its foot; the passage bird blown from\nits course to perish miserably far out at sea.\"\n\nHis conclusions were perhaps more logical than mine; nevertheless,\nalthough I could not argue the matter any more with him, I was not yet\nprepared to abandon this last cherished shred of old beliefs, although\nperhaps not cherished for its intrinsic worth, but rather because it had\nbeen given to me by a sweet woman whose memory was sacred to my\nheart--my mother before Chastel.\n\nFortunately, it was not necessary to continue the discussion any longer,\nfor at this juncture one of the watchers from the sick-room came to\nreport that the mother was still sleeping peacefully, hearing which, the\nfather rose to seek a little needful rest in an adjoining room. Before\ngoing, however, he proposed, with mistaken kindness, to relieve me of my\nburden, and place the girl without waking her on a couch. But I would\nnot consent to have her disturbed; and finally, to my great delight,\nthey left her still in my arms, the father warmly pressing my hand, and\nadvising me to reflect well on his words concerning prayer.\n\nIt was growing dark now, and how welcome that obscurity seemed, while\nwith no one nigh to see or hear I kissed her soft tresses a hundred\ntimes, and murmured a hundred endearing words in her sleeping ears.\n\nHer waking, which gave me a pang at first, afforded me in the end a\nstill greater bliss.\n\n\"Oh, how dark it is--where am I?\" she exclaimed, starting suddenly from\nrepose.\n\n\"With me, sweetest,\" I said. \"Do you not remember going to sleep on my\nbreast?\"\n\n\"Yes; but oh, why did you not wake me sooner? My mother--my mother--\"\n\n\"She is still quietly sleeping, dearest. Ah, I wish you also had\ncontinued sleeping! It was such a delight to have you in my arms.\"\n\n\"My love!\" she said, laying her soft cheek against mine. \"How sweet it\nwas to fall asleep in your arms! When we came in here I could scarcely\nsay a word, for my heart was too full for speech; and now I have a\nhundred things to say. After all, I should only finish by giving you a\nkiss, which is more eloquent than speech; so I shall kiss you at once,\nand save myself the trouble of talking so much.\"\n\n\"Say one of the hundred things, Yoletta.\"\n\n\"Oh, Smith, before this evening I did not think that I could love you\nmore; and sometimes, when I recalled what I once said to you--on the\nhill, do you remember?--it seemed to me that I already loved you a\nlittle too much. But now I am convinced that I was mistaken, for a\nthousand offenses could not alienate my heart, which is all yours\nforever.\"\n\n\"Mine for ever, without a doubt, darling?\" I murmured, holding her\nagainst my breast; and in my rapture almost forgetting that this angelic\naffection she lavished on me would not long satisfy my heart.\n\n\"Yes, for ever, for you shall never, never leave the house. Your\npilgrimage, from which you derived so little benefit, is over now. And\nif you ever attempt to go forth again to find out new wonders in the\nworld, I shall clasp you round with my arms, as I do now, and keep you\nprisoner against your will; and if you say 'Farewell' a hundred times to\nme, I shall blot out that sad word every time with my lips, and put a\nbetter one in its place, until my word conquers yours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\nAlthough deprived for the present of all intercourse with Chastel and\nYoletta, now in constant attendance on her mother, I ought to have been\nhappy, for all things seemed conspiring to make my life precious to me.\nNevertheless, I was far from happy; and, having heard so much said about\nreason in my late conversations with the father and mother of the house,\nI began to pay an unusual amount of attention to this faculty in me, in\norder to discover by its aid the secret of the sadness which continued\nat all times during this period to oppress my heart. I only discovered,\nwhat others have discovered before me, that the practice of\nintrospection has a corrosive effect on the mind, which only serves to\naggravate the malady it is intended to cure. During those restful days\nin the Mother's Room, when I had sat with Chastel, this spirit of\nmelancholy had been with me; but the mother's hallowing presence had\ngiven something of a divine color to it, my passions had slumbered, and,\nexcept at rare intervals, I had thought of sorrow as of something at an\nimmeasurable distance from me. Then to my spirit\n\n  \"_The gushing of the wave\n   Far, far away, did seem to mourn and rave\n   On alien shores_\";\n\nand so sweet had seemed that pause, that I had hoped and prayed for its\ncontinuance. No sooner was I separated from her than the charm\ndissolved, and all my thoughts, like evening clouds that appear luminous\nand rich in color until the sun has set, began to be darkened with a\nmysterious gloom. Strive how I might, I was unable to compose my mind to\nthat serene, trustful temper she had desired to see in me, and without\nwhich there could be no blissful futurity. After all the admonitions and\nthe comforting assurances I had received, and in spite of reason and all\nit could say to me, each night I went to my bed with a heavy heart; and\neach morning when I woke, there, by my pillow, waited that sad phantom,\nto go with me where I went, to remind me at every pause of an implacable\nFate, who held my future in its hands, who was mightier than Chastel,\nand would shatter all her schemes for my happiness like vessels of\nbrittle glass.\n\nSeveral days--probably about fifteen, for I did not count them--had\npassed since I had been admitted into the mother's sleeping-room, when\nthere came an exceedingly lovely day, which seemed to bring to me a\npleasant sensation of returning health, and made me long to escape from\nmorbid dreams and vain cravings. Why should I sit at home and mope, I\nthought; it was better to be active: sun and wind were full of healing.\nSuch a day was in truth one of those captain jewels \"that seldom placed\nare\" among the blusterous days of late autumn, with winter already\npresent to speed its parting. For a long time the sky had been overcast\nwith multitudes and endless hurrying processions of wild-looking\nclouds--torn, wind-chased fugitives, of every mournful shade of color,\nfrom palest gray to slatey-black; and storms of rain had been frequent,\nimpetuous, and suddenly intermitted, or passing away phantom-like\ntowards the misty hills, there to lose themselves among other phantoms,\never wandering sorrowfully in that vast, shadowy borderland where earth\nand heaven mingled; and gusts of wind which, as they roared by over a\nthousand straining trees and passed off with hoarse, volleying sounds,\nseemed to mimic the echoing thunder. And the leaves--the millions and\nmyriads of sere, cast-off leaves, heaped ankle-deep under the desolate\ngiants of the wood, and everywhere, in the hollows of the earth, lying\nsilent and motionless, as became dead, fallen things--suddenly catching a\nmock fantastic life from the wind, how they would all be up and\nstirring, every leaf with a hiss like a viper, racing, many thousands at\na time, over the barren spaces, all hurriedly talking together in their\ndead-leaf language! until, smitten with a mightier gust, they would rise\nin flight on flight, in storms and stupendous, eddying columns, whirled\nup to the clouds, to fall to the earth again in showers, and freckle the\ngrass for roods around. Then for a moment, far off in heavens, there\nwould be a rift, or a thinning of the clouds, and the sunbeams, striking\nlike lightning through their ranks, would illumine the pale blue mist,\nthe slanting rain, the gaunt black boles and branches, glittering with\nwet, casting a momentary glory over the ocean-like tumult of nature.\n\nIn the condition I was in, with a relaxed body and dejected mind, this\ntempestuous period, which would have only afforded fresh delight to a\nperson in perfect health, had no charm for my spirit; but, on the\ncontrary, it only served to intensify my gloom. And yet day after day it\ndrew me forth, although in my weakness I shivered in the rough gale, and\nshrank from the touch of the big cold drops the clouds flung down on me.\nIt fascinated me, like the sight of armies contending in battle, or of\nsome tragic action from which the spectator cannot withdraw his gaze.\nFor I had become infected with strange fancies, so persistent and somber\nthat they were like superstitions. It seemed to me that not I but nature\nhad changed, that the familiar light had passed like a kindly expression\nfrom her countenance, which was now charged with an awful menacing gloom\nthat frightened my soul. Sometimes, when straying alone, like an unquiet\nghost among the leafless trees, when a deeper shadow swept over the\nearth, I would pause, pale with apprehension, listening to the many\ndirge-like sounds of the forest, ever prophesying evil, until in my\ntrepidation I would start and tremble, and look to this side and to\nthat, as if considering which way to fly from some unimaginable calamity\ncoming, I knew not from where, to wreck my life for ever.\n\nThis bright day was better suited to my complaint. The sun shone as in\nspring; not a stain appeared on the crystal vault of heaven; everywhere\nthe unfailing grass gave rest to the eye with its verdure; and a light\nwind blew fresh and bracing in my face, making my pulses beat faster,\nalthough feebly still. Remembering my happy wood-cutting days, before my\ntrouble had come to me, I got my ax and started to walk to the wood;\nthen seeing Yoletta watching my departure from the terrace, I waved my\nhand to her. Before I had gone far, however, she came running to me,\nfull of anxiety, to warn me that I was not yet strong enough for such\nwork. I assured her that I had no intention of working hard and tiring\nmyself, then continued my walk, while she returned to attend on her\nmother.\n\nThe day was so bright with sunshine that it inspired me with a kind of\npassing gladness, and I began to hum snatches of old half-remembered\nsongs. They were songs of departing summer, tinged with melancholy, and\nsuggested other verses not meant for singing, which I began repeating.\n\n  \"Rich flowers have perished on the silent earth--\n   Blossoms of valley and of wood that gave\n   A fragrance to the winds.\"\n\n\nAnd again:\n\n  \"The blithesome birds have sought a sunnier shore;\n   They lingered till the cold cold winds went in\n   And withered their green homes.\"\n\n\nAnd these also were fragments, breathing only of sadness, which made me\nresolve to dismiss poetry from my mind and think of nothing at all. I\ntried to interest myself in a flight of buzzard-like hawks, soaring in\nwide circles at an immense height above me. Gazing up into that far blue\nvault, under which they moved so serenely, and which seemed so infinite,\nI remembered how often in former days, when gazing up into such a sky, I\nhad breathed a prayer to the Unseen Spirit; but now I recalled the words\nthe father of the house had spoken to me, and the prayer died unformed\nin my heart, and a strange feeling of orphanhood saddened me, and\nbrought my eyes to earth again.\n\nHalf-way to the wood, on an open reach where there were no trees or\nbushes, I came on a great company of storks, half a thousand of them at\nleast, apparently resting on their travels, for they were all standing\nmotionless, with necks drawn in, as if dozing. They were very stately,\nhandsome birds, clear gray in color, with a black collar on the neck,\nand red beak and legs. My approach did not disturb them until I was\nwithin twenty yards of the nearest--for they were scattered over an acre\nof ground; then they rose with a loud, rustling noise of wings, only to\nsettle again at a short distance off.\n\nIncredible numbers of birds, chiefly waterfowl, had appeared in the\nneighborhood since the beginning of the wet, boisterous weather; the\nriver too was filled with these new visitors, and I was told that most\nof them were passengers driven from distant northern regions, which they\nmade their summer home, and were now flying south in search of a warmer\nclimate.\n\nAll this movement in the feathered world had, during my troubled days,\nbrought me as little pleasure as the other changes going on about me:\nthose winged armies ever hurrying by in broken detachments, wailing and\nclanging by day and by night in the clouds, white with their own terror,\nor black-plumed like messengers of doom, to my distempered fancy only\nadded a fresh element of fear to a nature racked with disorders, and\nfull of tremendous signs and omens.\n\nThe interest with which I now remarked these pilgrim storks seemed to me\na pleasant symptom of a return to a saner state of mind, and before\ncontinuing my walk I wished that Yoletta had been there with me to see\nthem and tell me their history; for she was curious about such matters,\nand had a most wonderful affection for the whole feathered race. She had\nher favorites among the birds at different seasons, and the kind she\nmost esteemed now had been arriving for over a month, their numbers\nincreasing day by day until the woods and fields were alive with their\nflocks.\n\nThis kind was named the cloud-bird, on account of its starling-like\nhabit of wheeling about over its feeding-ground, the birds throwing\nthemselves into masses, then scattering and gathering again many times,\nso that when viewed at a distance a large flock had the appearance of a\ncloud, growing dark and thin alternately, and continually changing its\nform. It was somewhat larger than a starling, with a freer flight, and\nhad a richer plumage, its color being deep glossy blue, or blue-black,\nand underneath bright chestnut. When close at hand and in the bright\nsunshine, the aerial gambols of a flock were beautiful to witness, as\nthe birds wheeled about and displayed in turn, as if moved by one\nimpulse, first the rich blue, then the bright chestnut surfaces to the\neye. The charming effect was increased by the bell-like, chirping notes\nthey all uttered together, and as they swept round or doubled in the air\nat intervals came these tempests of melodious sound--a most perfect\nexpression of wild jubilant bird-life. Yoletta, discoursing in the most\ndelightful way about her loved cloud-birds, had told me that they spent\nthe summer season in great solitary marshes, where they built their\nnests in the rushes; but with cold weather they flew abroad, and at such\ntimes seemed always to prefer the neighborhood of man, remaining in\ngreat flocks near the house until the next spring. On this bright sunny\nmorning I was amazed at the multitudes I saw during my walk: yet it was\nnot strange that birds were so abundant, considering that there were no\nlonger any savages on the earth, with nothing to amuse their vacant\nminds except killing the feathered creatures with their bows and arrows,\nand no innumerable company of squaws clamorous for trophies--unchristian\nwomen of the woods with painted faces, insolence in their eyes, and for\nornaments the feathered skins torn from slain birds on their heads.\n\nWhen I at length arrived at the wood, I went to that spot where I had\nfelled the large tree on the occasion of my last and disastrous visit,\nand where Yoletta, newly released from confinement, had found me. There\nlay the rough-barked giant exactly as I had left it, and once more I\nbegan to hack at the large branches; but my feeble strokes seemed to\nmake little impression, and becoming tired in a very short time, I\nconcluded that I was not yet equal to such work, and sat myself down to\nrest. I remembered how, when sitting on that very spot, I had heard a\nslight rustling of the withered leaves, and looking up beheld Yoletta\ncoming swiftly towards me with outstretched arms, and her face shining\nwith joy. Perhaps she would come again to me to-day: yes, she would\nsurely come when I wished for her so much; for she had followed me out\nto try to dissuade me from going to the woods, and would be anxiously\nthinking about me; and she could spare an hour from the sick-room now.\nThe trees and bushes would prevent me from seeing her approach, but I\nshould hear her, as I had heard her before. I sat motionless, scarcely\nbreathing, straining my sense to catch the first faint sound of her\nlight, swift step; and every time a small bird, hopping along the\nground, rustled a withered leaf, I started up to greet and embrace her.\nBut she did not come; and at last, sick at heart with hope deferred, I\ncovered my face with my hands, and, weak with misery, cried like a\ndisappointed child.\n\nPresently something touched me, and, removing my hands from my face, I\nsaw that great silver-gray dog which had come to Yoletta's call when I\nfainted, sitting before me with his chin resting on my knees. No doubt\nhe remembered that last wood-cutting day very well, and had come to take\ncare of me now.\n\n\"Welcome, dear old friend!\" said I; and in my craving for sympathy of\nsome kind I put my arms over him, and pressed my face against his. Then\nI sat up again, and gazed into the pair of clear brown eyes watching my\nface so gravely.\n\n\"Look here, old fellow,\" said I, talking audibly to him for want of\nsomething in human shape to address, \"you didn't lick my face just now\nwhen you might have done so with impunity; and when I speak to you, you\ndon't wag that beautiful bushy tail which serves you for ornament. This\nreminds me that you are not like the dogs I used to know--the dogs that\ntalked with their tails, caressed with their tongues, and were never\nover-clean or well-behaved. Where are they now--collies, rat-worrying\nterriers, hounds, spaniels, pointers, retrievers--dogs rough and dogs\nsmooth; big brute boarhounds, St. Bernard's, mastiffs, nearly or quite\nas big as you are, but not so slender, silky-haired, and sharp-nosed,\nand without your refined expression of keenness without cunning. And\nafter these canine noblemen of the old _regime_, whither has\nvanished the countless rabble of mongrels, curs, and pariah dogs; and\nlast of all--being more degenerate--the corpulent, blear-eyed, wheezy\npet dogs of a hundred breeds? They are all dead, no doubt: they have\nbeen dead so long that I daresay nature extracted all the valuable salts\nthat were contained in their flesh and bones thousands of years ago, and\nused it for better things--raindrops, froth of the sea, flowers and\nfruit, and blades of grass. Yet there was not a beast in all that crew\nof which its master or mistress was not ready to affirm that it could do\neverything but talk! No one says that of you, my gentle guardian; for\ndog-worship, with all the ten thousand fungoid cults that sprang up and\nflourished exceedingly in the muddy marsh of man's intellect, has\nwithered quite away, and left no seed. Yet in intelligence you are, I\nfancy, somewhat ahead of your far-off progenitors: long use has also\ngiven you something like a conscience. You are a good, sensible beast,\nthat's all. You love and serve your master, according to your lights;\nnight and day, you, with your fellows, guard his flocks and herds, his\nhouse and fields. Into his sacred house, however, you do not intrude\nyour comely countenance, knowing your place.\"\n\n\"What, then, happened to earth, and how long did that undreaming slumber\nlast from which I woke to find things so altered? I do not know, nor\ndoes it matter very much. I only know that there has been a sort of\nmighty Savonarola bonfire, in which most of the things once valued have\nbeen consumed to ashes--politics, religions, systems of philosophy, isms\nand ologies of all descriptions; schools, churches, prisons, poorhouses;\nstimulants and tobacco; kings and parliaments; cannon with its hostile\nroar, and pianos that thundered peacefully; history, the press, vice,\npolitical economy, money, and a million things more--all consumed like\nso much worthless hay and stubble. This being so, why am I not\noverwhelmed at the thought of it? In that feverish, full age--so full,\nand yet, my God, how empty!--in the wilderness of every man's soul, was\nnot a voice heard crying out, prophesying the end? I know that a thought\nsometimes came to me, passing through my brain like lightning through\nthe foliage of a tree; and in the quick, blighting fire of that\nintolerable thought, all hopes, beliefs, dreams, and schemes seemed\ninstantaneously to shrivel up and turn to ashes, and drop from me, and\nleave me naked and desolate. Sometimes it came when I read a book of\nphilosophy; or listened on a still, hot Sunday to a dull preacher--they\nwere mostly dull--prosing away to a sleepy, fashionable congregation\nabout Daniel in the lions' den, or some other equally remote matter; or\nwhen I walked in crowded thoroughfares; or when I heard some great\npolitician out of office--out in the cold, like a miserable working-man\nwith no work to do--hurling anathemas at an iniquitous government; and\nsometimes also when I lay awake in the silent watches of the night. A\nlittle while, the thought said, and all this will be no more; for we\nhave not found out the secret of happiness, and all our toil and effort\nis misdirected; and those who are seeking for a mechanical equivalent of\nconsciousness, and those who are going about doing good, are alike\nwasting their lives; and on all our hopes, beliefs, dreams, theories,\nand enthusiasms, 'Passing away' is written plainly as the _Mene, mene,\ntekel, upharsin_ seen by Belshazzar on the wall of his palace in\nBabylon.\"\n\n\"That withering thought never comes to me now. 'Passing away' is not\nwritten on the earth, which is still God's green footstool; the grass\nwas not greener nor the flowers sweeter when man was first made out of\nclay, and the breath of life breathed into his nostrils. And the human\nfamily and race--outcome of all that dead, unimaginable past--this also\nappears to have the stamp of everlastingness on it; and in its tranquil\npower and majesty resembles some vast mountain that lifts its head above\nthe clouds, and has its granite roots deep down in the world's center. A\nfeeling of awe is in me when I gaze on it; but it is vain to ask myself\nnow whether the vanished past, with its manifold troubles and transitory\ndelights, was preferable to this unchanging peaceful present. I care for\nnothing but Yoletta; and if the old world was consumed to ashes that she\nmight be created, I am pleased that it was so consumed; for nobler than\nall perished hopes and ambitions is the hope that I may one day wear\nthat bright, consummate flower on my bosom.\"\n\n\"I have only one trouble now--a wolf that follows me everywhere, always\nthreatening to rend me to pieces with its black jaws. Not you, old\nfriend--a great, gaunt, man-eating, metaphorical wolf, far more terrible\nthan that beast of the ancients which came to the poor man's door. In\nthe darkness its eyes, glowing like coals, are ever watching me, and\neven in the bright daylight its shadowy form is ever near me, stealing\nfrom bush to bush, or from room to room, always dogging my footsteps.\nWill it ever vanish, like a mere phantom--a wolf of the brain--or will\nit come nearer and more near, to spring upon and rend me at the last? If\nthey could only clothe my mind as they have my body, to make me like\nthemselves with no canker at my heart, ever contented and calmly glad!\nBut nothing comes from taking thought. I am sick of thought--I hate it!\nAway with it! I shall go and look for Yoletta, since she does not come\nto me. Good-by, old friend, you have been well-behaved and listened with\nconsiderable patience to a long discourse. It will benefit you about as\nmuch as I have been benefited by many a lecture and many a sermon I was\ncompelled to listen to in the old vanished days.\"\n\nBestowing another caress on him I got up and went back to the house,\nthinking sadly as I walked that the bright weather had not yet greatly\nimproved my spirits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\nArrived at the house I was again disappointed at not seeing Yoletta; yet\nwithout reasonable cause, since it was scarcely past midday, and she\ncame out from attending on her mother only at long intervals--in the\nmorning, and again just before evening--to taste the freshness of nature\nfor a few minutes.\n\nThe music-room was deserted when I went there; but it was made warm and\npleasant by the sun shining brightly in at the doors opening to the\nsouth. I went on to the extreme end of the room, remembering now that I\nhad seen some volumes there when I had no time or inclination to look at\nthem, and I wanted something to read; for although I found reading very\nirksome at this period, there was really little else I could do. I found\nthe books--three volumes--in the lower part of an alcove in the wall;\nabove them, within a niche in the alcove, on a level with my face as I\nstood there, I observed a bulb-shaped bottle, with a long thin neck,\nvery beautifully colored. I had seen it before, but without paying\nparticular attention to it, there being so many treasures of its kind in\nthe house; now, seeing it so closely, I could not help admiring its\nexquisite beauty, and feeling puzzled at the scene depicted on it. In\nthe widest part it was encircled with a band, and on it appeared slim\nyouths and maidens, in delicate, rose-colored garments, with butterfly\nwings on their shoulders, running or hurriedly walking, playing on\ninstruments of various forms, their faces shining with gladness, their\ngolden hair tossed by the wind--a gay procession, without beginning or\nend. Behind these joyful ones, in pale gray, and half-obscured by the\nmists that formed the background, appeared a second procession, hurrying\nin an opposite direction--men and women of all ages, but mostly old,\nwith haggard, woebegone faces; some bowed down, their eyes fixed on the\nground; others wringing their hands, or beating their breasts; and all\napparently suffering the utmost affliction of mind.\n\nAbove the bottle there was a deep circular cell in the alcove, about\nfifteen inches in diameter; fitted in it was a metal ring, to which were\nattached golden strings, fine as gossamer threads: behind the first ring\nwas a second, and further in still others, all stringed like the first,\nso that looking into the cell it appeared filled with a mist of golden\ncobweb.\n\nDrawing a cushioned seat to this secluded nook, where no person passing\ncasually through the room would be able to see me, I sat down, and\nfeeling too indolent to get myself a reading-stand, I supported the\nvolume I had taken up to read on my knees. It was entitled _Conduct\nand Ceremonial,_ and the subject-matter was divided into short\nsections, each with an appropriate heading. Turning over the leaves, and\nreading a sentence here and there in different sections, it occurred to\nme that this might prove a most useful work for me to study, whenever I\ncould bring my mind into the right frame for such a task; for it\ncontained minute instructions upon all points relating to individual\nconduct in the house--as the entertainment of pilgrims, the dress to be\nworn, and the conduct to be observed at the various annual festivals,\nwith other matters of the kind. Glancing through it in this rapid way, I\nsoon finished with the first volume, then went through the second in\neven less time, for many of the concluding sections related to\nlugubrious subjects which I did not care to linger over; the titles\nalone were enough to trouble me--Decay through Age, Ailments of Mind and\nof Body; then Death, and, finally, the Disposal of the Dead. This done I\ntook up the third volume, the last of the series, the first portion of\nwhich was headed, _Renewal of the Family_. This part I began to\nexamine with some attention, and pretty soon discovered that I had now\nat last accidentally stumbled upon a perfect mine of information of the\nprecise kind I had so long and so vainly been seeking. Struggling to\novercome my agitation I read on, hurrying through page after page with\nthe greatest rapidity; for there was here much matter that had no\nspecial interest for me, but incidentally the things which concerned me\nmost to know were touched on, and in some cases minutely explained. As I\nproceeded, the prophetic gloom which had oppressed me all that day, and\nfor so many days before, darkened to the blackness of despair, and\nsuddenly throwing up my arms, the book slipped from my knees and fell\nwith a crash upon the floor. There, face downwards, with its beautiful\nleaves doubled and broken under its weight, it rested unheeded at my\nfeet. For now the desired knowledge was mine, and that dream of\nhappiness which had illumined my life was over. Now I possessed the\nsecret of that passionless, everlasting calm of beings who had for ever\noutlived, and left as immeasurably far behind as the instincts of the\nwolf and ape, the strongest emotion of which my heart was capable. For\nthe children of the house there could be no union by marriage; in body\nand soul they differed from me: they had no name for that feeling which\nI had so often and so vainly declared; therefore they had told me again\nand again that there was only one kind of love, for they, alas! could\nexperience one kind only. I did not, for the moment, seek further in the\nbook, or pause to reflect on that still unexplained mystery, which was\nthe very center and core of the whole mater, namely, the existence of\nthe father and mother in the house, from whose union the family was\nrenewed, and who, fruitful themselves, were yet the parents of a barren\nrace. Nor did I ask who their successors would be: for albeit\nlong-lived, they were mortal like their own passionless children, and in\nthis particular house their lives appeared now to be drawing to an end.\nThese were questions I cared nothing about. It was enough to know that\nYoletta could never love me as I loved her--that she could never be\nmine, body and soul, in my way and not in hers. With unspeakable\nbitterness I recalled my conversation with Chastel: now all her\nprofessions of affection and goodwill, all her schemes for smoothing my\nway and securing my happiness, seemed to me the veriest mockery, since\neven she had read my heart no better than the others, and that chill\nmoonlight felicity, beyond which her children were powerless to imagine\nanything, had no charm for my passion-torn heart.\n\nPresently, when I began to recover somewhat from my stupefaction, and to\nrealize the magnitude of my loss, the misery of it almost drove me mad.\nI wished that I had never made this fatal discovery, that I might have\ncontinued still hoping and dreaming, and wearing out my heart with\nstriving after the impossible, since any fate would have been preferable\nto the blank desolation which now confronted me. I even wished to\npossess the power of some implacable god or demon, that I might shatter\nthe sacred houses of this later race, and destroy them everlastingly,\nand repeople the peaceful world with struggling, starving millions, as\nin the past, so that the beautiful flower of love which had withered in\nmen's hearts might blossom again.\n\nWhile these insane thoughts were passing through my brain I had risen\nfrom my seat, and stood leaning against the edge of the alcove, with\nthat curious richly-colored bottle close to my eyes. There were letters\non it, noticed now for the first time--minute, hair-like lines beneath\nthe strange-contrasted processionists depicted on the band--and even in\nmy excited condition I was a little startled when these letters, forming\nthe end of a sentence, shaped themselves into the words--_and for the\nold life there shall be a new life_.\n\nTurning the bottle round I read the whole sentence. _When time and\ndisease oppress, and the sun grows cold in heaven, and there is no\nlonger any joy on the earth, and the fire of love grows cold in the\nheart, drink of me, and for the old life there shall be a new life._\n\n\"Another important secret!\" thought I; \"this day has certainly been\nfruitful in discoveries. A panacea for all diseases, even for the\ndisease of old age, so that a man may live two hundred years, and still\nfind some pleasure in existence. But for me life has lost its savor, and\nI have no wish to last so long. There is more writing here--another\nsecret perhaps, but I doubt very much that it will give me any comfort.\"\n\n_When your soul is darkened, so that it is hard to know evil from\ngood, and the thoughts that are in you lead to madness, drink of me, and\nbe cured._\n\n\"No, I shall not drink and be cured! Better a thousand times the\nthoughts that lead to madness than this colorless existence without\nlove. I do not wish to recover from so sweet a malady.\"\n\nI took the bottle in my hand and unstopped it. The stopper formed a\ncurious little cup, round the rim of which was written, _Drink of\nme_. I poured some of the liquid out into the cup; it was pale yellow\nin color, and had a faint sickly smell as of honeysuckles. Then I poured\nit back again and replaced the bottle in its niche.\n\n_Drink and be cured_. No, not yet. Some day, perhaps, my trouble\nincreasing till it might no longer be borne, would drive me to seek such\ndreary comfort as this cure-all bottle contained. To love without hope\nwas sad enough, but to be without love was even sadder.\n\nI had grown calm now: the knowledge that I had it in my power to escape\nat once and for eyer from that rage of desire, had served to sober my\nmind, and at last I began to reason about the matter. The nature of my\nsecret feelings could never be suspected, and in the unsubstantial realm\nof the imagination it would still be in my power to hide myself with my\nlove, and revel in all supreme delight. Would not that be better than\nthis cure--this calm contentment held out to me? And in time also my\nfeelings would lose their present intensity, which often made them an\nagony, and would come at last to exist only as a gentle rapture stirring\nin my heart when I clasped my darling to my bosom and pressed her sweet\nlips with mine. Ah, no! that was a vain dream, I could not be deceived\nby it; for who can say to the demon of passion in him, thus far shalt\nthou go and no further?\n\nPerplexed in mind and unable to decide which thing was best, my troubled\nthoughts at length took me back to that far-off dead past, when the\npassion of love was so much in man's life. It was much; but in that\nover-populated world it divided the empire of his soul with a great,\never-growing misery--the misery of the hungry ones whose minds were\ndarkened, through long years of decadence, with a sullen rage against\nGod and man; and the misery of those who, wanting nothing, yet feared\nthat the end of all things was coming to them.\n\nFor the space of half an hour I pondered on these things, then said: \"If\nI were to tell a hundredth part of this black retrospect to Yoletta,\nwould not she bid me drink and forget, and herself pour out the divine\nliquor, and press it to my lips?\"\n\nAgain I took the bottle with trembling hand, and filled the same small\ncup to the brim, saying: \"For your sake then, Yoletta, let me drink, and\nbe cured; for this is what you desire, and you are more to me than life\nor passion or happiness. But when this consuming fire has left me--this\nfeeling which until now burns and palpitates in every drop of my blood,\nevery fiber of my being--I know that you shall still be to me a sweet,\nsacred sister and immaculate bride, worshipped more of my soul than any\nmother in the house; that loving and being loved by you shall be my one\ngreat joy all my life long.\"\n\nI drained the cup deliberately, then stopped the bottle and put it back\nin its place. The liquor was tasteless, but colder than ice, and made me\nshiver when I swallowed it. I began to wonder whether I would be\nconscious of the change it was destined to work in me or not; and then,\nhalf regretting what I had done, I wished that Yoletta would come to me,\nso that I might clasp her in my arms with all the old fervor once more,\nbefore that icy-cold liquor had done its work. Finally, I carefully\nraised the fallen book, and smoothed out its doubled leaves, regretting\nthat I had injured it; and, sitting down again, I held the open volume\nas before, resting on my knees. Now, however, I perceived that it had\nopened at a place some pages in advance of the passages which had\nexcited me; but, feeling no desire to go back to resume my reading just\nwhere I had left off, my eyes mechanically sought the top of the page\nbefore me, and this is what I read:\n\n\"...make choice of one of the daughters of the house; it is fitting that\nshe should rejoice for that brighter excellence which caused her to be\nraised to so high a state, and to have authority over all others, since\nin her, with the father, all the majesty and glory of the house is\ncentered; albeit with a solemn and chastened joy, like that of the\npilgrim who, journeying to some distant tropical region of the earth,\nand seeing the shores of his native country fading from sight, thinks at\none and the same time of the unimaginable beauties of nature and art\nthat fire his mind and call him away, and of the wide distance which\nwill hold him for many years divided from all familiar scenes and the\nbeings he loves best, and of the storms and perils of the great\nwilderness of waves, into which so many have ventured and have not\nreturned. For now a changed body and soul shall separate her forever\nfrom those who were one in nature with her; and with that superior\nhappiness destined to be hers there shall be the pains and perils of\nchildbirth, with new griefs and cares unknown to those of humbler\ncondition. But on that lesser gladness had by the children of the house\nin her exaltation, and because there will be a new mother in the\nhouse--one chosen from themselves--there shall be no cloud or shadow;\nand, taking her by the hand, and kissing her face in token of joy, and\nof that new filial love and obedience which will be theirs, they shall\nlead her to the Mother's Room, thereafter to be inhabited by her as long\nas life lasts. And she shall no longer serve in the house or suffer\nrebuke; but all shall serve her in love, and hold her in reverence, who\nis their predestined mother. And for the space of one year she shall be\nwithout authority in the house, being one apart, instructing herself in\nthe secret books which it is not lawful for another to read, and\nobserving day by day the directions contained therein, until that new\nknowledge and practice shall ripen her for that state she has been\nchosen to fill.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nThis passage was a fresh revelation to me. Again I recalled Chastel's\nwords, her repeated assurances that she knew what was passing in my\nmind, that her eyes saw things more clearly than others could see them,\nthat only by giving me the desire of my heart could the one remaining\nhope of her life be fulfilled. Now I seemed able to understand these\ndark sayings, and a new excitement, full of the joy of hope, sprang up\nin me, making me forget the misery I had so recently experienced, and\neven that increasing sensation of intense cold caused by the draught\nfrom the mysterious bottle.\n\nI continued reading, but the above passage was succeeded by minute\ninstructions, extending over several pages, concerning the dress, both\nfor ordinary and extraordinary occasions, to be worn by the chosen\ndaughter during her year of preparation: the conduct to be observed by\nher towards other members of the family, also towards pilgrims visiting\nthe house in the interval, with many other matters of secondary\nimportance. Impatient to reach the end, I tried to turn the leaves\nrapidly, but now found that my arm had grown strangely stiff and cold,\nand seemed like an arm of iron when I raised it, so that the turning\nover of each leaf was an immense labor. Then I read yet another page,\nbut with the utmost difficulty; for, notwithstanding the eagerness of my\nmind, my eyes began to remain more and more rigidly fixed on the center\nof the leaf, so that I could scarcely force them to follow the lines.\nHere I read that the bride-elect, her year of preparation being over,\nrises before daylight, and goes out alone to an appointed place at a\ngreat distance from the house, there to pass several hours in solitude\nand silence, communing with her own heart. Meanwhile, in the house all\nthe others array themselves in purple garments, and go out singing at\nsunrise to gather flowers to adorn their heads; then, proceeding to the\nappointed spot, they seek for their new mother, and, finding her, lead\nher home with music and rejoicing.\n\nWhen, reading in this miserable, painful way, I had reached the bottom\nof the page, and attempted to turn it over, I found that I could no\nlonger move my hand--my arms being now like arms of iron, absolutely\ndevoid of sensation, while my hands, rigidly grasping the book like the\nhands of a frozen corpse, held it upright and motionless before me. I\ntried to start up and shake off this strange deadness from my body, but\nwas powerless to move a muscle. What was the meaning of this condition?\nfor I had absolutely no pain, no discomfort even; for the sensation of\nintense cold had almost ceased, and my mind was active and clear, and I\ncould hear and see, and yet was as powerless as if I had been buried in\na marble coffin a thousand fathoms deep in earth.\n\nSuddenly I remembered the draught from the bottle, and a terrible doubt\nshot through my heart. Alas! had I mistaken the meaning of those strange\nwords I had read?--was _death_ the cure which that mysterious\nvessel promised to those who drank of its contents? \"When life becomes a\nburden, it is good to lay it down\"; now too late the words of the\nfather, when reproving me after my fever, came back to my mind in all\ntheir awful significance.\n\nAll at once I heard a voice calling my name, and in a moment the tempest\nin me was stilled. Yes, it was my darling's voice--she was coming to\nme--she would save me in this dire extremity. Again and again she\ncalled, but the voice now sounded further and further away; and with\nineffable anguish I remembered that she would not be able to see me\nwhere I sat. I tried to cry out, \"Come quick, Yoletta, and save me from\ndeath!\" but though I mentally repeated the words again and again in an\nextreme agony of terror, my frozen tongue refused to make a sound.\nPresently I heard a light, quick step on the floor, then Yoletta's clear\nvoice.\n\n\"Oh, I have found you at last!\" she cried. \"I have been seeking you all\nover the house. I have something glad to tell you--something to make you\nhappier than on that day--do you remember?--when you saw me coming to\nyou in the wood. The mother has left her chamber at last; she is in the\nMother's Room again, waiting impatiently to see you. Come, come!\"\n\nHer words sounded distinctly in my ears, and although I could not lift\nor turn my rigid eyes to see her, yet I seemed to see her now better\nthan ever before, with some fresh glory, as of a new, unaccustomed\ngladness or excitement enhancing her unsurpassed loveliness, so clearly\nat that moment did her image shine in my soul! And not hers only, for\nnow suddenly, by a miracle of the mind, the entire family appeared there\nbefore me; and in the midst sat Chastel, my sweet, suffering mother, as\non that day after my illness when she had pardoned me, and put out her\nhand for me to kiss. As on that occasion, now--now she was gazing on me\nwith such divine love and compassion in her eyes, her lips half parted,\nand a slight color flushing her pale face, recalling to it the bloom and\nradiance of which cruel disease had robbed her! And in my soul also, at\nthat supreme moment, like a scene starting at the lightning's flash out\nof thick darkness, shone the image of the house, with all its wide,\ntranquil rooms rich in art and ancient memories, every stone within them\nglowing, with everlasting beauty--a house enduring as the green plains\nand rushing rivers and solemn woods and world-old hills amid which it\nwas set like a sacred gem! O sweet abode of love and peace and purity of\nheart! O bliss surpassing that of the angels! O rich heritage, must I\nlose you for ever! Save me from death, Yoletta, my love, my bride--save\nme--save me--save me!\n\nThen something touched or fell on my neck, and at the same moment a\ndeeper shadow passed over the page before me, with all its rich coloring\nfloating formless, like vapors, mingling and separating, or dancing\nbefore my vision, like bright-winged insects hovering in the sunlight;\nand I knew that she was bending over me, her hand on my neck, her loose\nhair falling on my forehead.\n\nIn that enforced stillness and silence I waited expectant for some\nmoments.\n\nThen a great cry, as of one who suddenly sees a black phantom, rang out\nloud in the room, jarring my brain with the madness of its terror, and\nstriking as with a hundred passionate hands on all the hidden harps in\nwall and roof; and the troubled sounds came back to me, now loud and now\nlow, burdened with an infinite anguish and despair, as of voices of\ninnumerable multitudes wandering in the sunless desolations of space,\nevery voice reverberating anguish and despair; and the successive\nreverberations lifted me like waves and dropped me again, and the waves\ngrew less and the sounds fainter, then fainter still, and died in\neverlasting silence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Crystal Age, by W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1369,"split":"test"}
