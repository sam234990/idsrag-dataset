{"ori_id":"0bff02718921b6f106c87a5418f29553790954af","title":"The Wonderful Visit","context":"The Wonderful Visit\n The Wonderful Visit tells how an angel spends a little more than a week in southern England. He is at first mistaken for a bird because of his dazzling polychromatic plumage, for he is \"neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief,\" but rather \"the Angel of Italian art.\" As a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the Rev. K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. The creature comes from \"the Land of Dreams\" (also the angel's term for our world), and while \"charmingly affable,\" is \"quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation.\" During his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in Victorian England in particular. As he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as \"a Socialist.\"\nThe vicar, his host, meanwhile comes under attack by fellow clerics, neighbours, and even servants for harbouring a disreputable character (no one but the vicar believes he comes from another world, and people take to calling him \"Mr. Angel\"). The angel's one talent is his divine violin-playing, but he is discredited at a reception that Lady Hammergallow agrees to host when it is discovered that he cannot read music and confides to a sympathetic listener that he has taken an interest in the vicar's serving girl, Delia. Instead of healing, his wings begin to atrophy. The local physician, Dr. Crump, threatens to have him put in a prison or a madhouse. After the angel destroys some barbed wire on a local baronet's property, Sir John Gotch gives the vicar one week to send him away before he begins proceedings against him.\nThe Rev. Mr. Hilyer is regretfully planning how he will take the angel to London and try to establish him there when two catastrophes abort the plan. First, the angel, who \"had been breathing the poisonous air of this Struggle for Existence of ours for more than a week,\" beats Sir John Gotch with Gotch's own whip in a fury after the local landowner insolently orders him off his land. Distraught to think (mistakenly) that he has killed a man, he returns to the village to find the vicar's house in flames. Delia, the serving girl, has entered the burning building in an attempt to rescue the angel's violin: this extraordinary act comes as a revelation to the angel. \"Then in a flash he saw it all, saw this grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured in a splendour that outshone the Angelic Land, suffused suddenly and insupportably glorious with the wonderful light of Love and Self-Sacrifice.\" The angel attempts to rescue Delia, someone seems to see \"two figures with wings\" flash up and vanish among the flames, and a strange music that \"began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door\" suggests that the angel has gone back to where he came from, accompanied by Delia. An epilogue reveals that \"there is nothing beneath\" the two white crosses in Siddermorton cemetery that bear the names of Thomas Angel and Delia Hardy, and that the vicar, who never recovered his aplomb after the angel's departure, died within a year of the fire.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wonderful Visit, by Herbert George Wells\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

But no one in Sidderford saw\nit, for most of Sidderford was abed.\n\nAll day the wind had been rising, so that the larks on the moor\nchirruped fitfully near the ground, or rose only to be driven like\nleaves before the wind. The sun set in a bloody welter of clouds, and\nthe moon was hidden. The glare, they say, was golden like a beam shining\nout of the sky, not a uniform blaze, but broken all over by curving\nflashes like the waving of swords. It lasted but a moment and left the\nnight dark and obscure. There were letters about it in _Nature_, and a\nrough drawing that no one thought very like. (You may see it for\nyourself--the drawing that was unlike the glare--on page 42 of Vol.\ncclx. of that publication.)\n\nNone in Sidderford saw the light, but Annie, Hooker Durgan's wife, was\nlying awake, and she saw the reflection of it--a flickering tongue of\ngold--dancing on the wall.\n\nShe, too, was one of those who heard the sound. The others who heard the\nsound were Lumpy Durgan, the half-wit, and Amory's mother. They said it\nwas a sound like children singing and a throbbing of harp strings,\ncarried on a rush of notes like that which sometimes comes from an\norgan. It began and ended like the opening and shutting of a door, and\nbefore and after they heard nothing but the night wind howling over the\nmoor and the noise of the caves under Sidderford cliff. Amory's mother\nsaid she wanted to cry when she heard it, but Lumpy was only sorry he\ncould hear no more.\n\nThat is as much as anyone can tell you of the glare upon Sidderford\nMoor and the alleged music therewith. And whether these had any real\nconnexion with the Strange Bird whose history follows, is more than I\ncan say. But I set it down here for reasons that will be more apparent\nas the story proceeds.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMING OF THE STRANGE BIRD.\n\nII.\n\n\nSandy Bright was coming down the road from Spinner's carrying a side of\nbacon he had taken in exchange for a clock. He saw nothing of the light\nbut he heard and saw the Strange Bird. He suddenly heard a flapping and\na voice like a woman wailing, and being a nervous man and all alone, he\nwas alarmed forthwith, and turning (all a-tremble) saw something large\nand black against the dim darkness of the cedars up the hill. It seemed\nto be coming right down upon him, and incontinently he dropped his bacon\nand set off running, only to fall headlong.\n\nHe tried in vain--such was his state of mind--to remember the beginning\nof the Lord's Prayer. The strange bird flapped over him, something\nlarger than himself, with a vast spread of wings, and, as he thought,\nblack. He screamed and gave himself up for lost. Then it went past him,\nsailing down the hill, and, soaring over the vicarage, vanished into the\nhazy valley towards Sidderford.\n\nAnd Sandy Bright lay upon his stomach there, for ever so long, staring\ninto the darkness after the strange bird. At last he got upon his knees\nand began to thank Heaven for his merciful deliverance, with his eyes\ndownhill. He went on down into the village, talking aloud and confessing\nhis sins as he went, lest the strange bird should come back. All who\nheard him thought him drunk. But from that night he was a changed man,\nand had done with drunkenness and defrauding the revenue by selling\nsilver ornaments without a licence. And the side of bacon lay upon the\nhillside until the tallyman from Portburdock found it in the morning.\n\nThe next who saw the Strange Bird was a solicitor's clerk at Iping\nHanger, who was climbing the hill before breakfast, to see the sunrise.\nSave for a few dissolving wisps of cloud the sky had been blown clear\nin the night. At first he thought it was an eagle he saw. It was near\nthe zenith, and incredibly remote, a mere bright speck above the pink\ncirri, and it seemed as if it fluttered and beat itself against the sky,\nas an imprisoned swallow might do against a window pane. Then down it\ncame into the shadow of the earth, sweeping in a great curve towards\nPortburdock and round over the Hanger, and so vanishing behind the woods\nof Siddermorton Park. It seemed larger than a man. Just before it was\nhidden, the light of the rising sun smote over the edge of the downs and\ntouched its wings, and they flashed with the brightness of flames and\nthe colour of precious stones, and so passed, leaving the witness agape.\n\nA ploughman going to his work, along under the stone wall of\nSiddermorton Park, saw the Strange Bird flash over him for a moment and\nvanish among the hazy interstices of the beech trees. But he saw little\nof the colour of the wings, witnessing only that its legs, which were\nlong, seemed pink and bare like naked flesh, and its body mottled white.\nIt smote like an arrow through the air and was gone.\n\nThese were the first three eye-witnesses of the Strange Bird.\n\nNow in these days one does not cower before the devil and one's own\nsinfulness, or see strange iridiscent wings in the light of dawn, and\nsay nothing of it afterwards. The young solicitor's clerk told his\nmother and sisters at breakfast, and, afterwards, on his way to the\noffice at Portburdock, spoke of it to the blacksmith of Hammerpond, and\nspent the morning with his fellow clerks marvelling instead of copying\ndeeds. And Sandy Bright went to talk the matter over with Mr Jekyll, the\n\"Primitive\" minister, and the ploughman told old Hugh and afterwards the\nvicar of Siddermorton.\n\n\"They are not an imaginative race about here,\" said the Vicar of\nSiddermorton, \"I wonder how much of that was true. Barring that he\nthinks the wings were brown it sounds uncommonly like a Flamingo.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUNTING OF THE STRANGE BIRD.\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe Vicar of Siddermorton (which is nine miles inland from Siddermouth\nas the crow flies) was an ornithologist. Some such pursuit, botany,\nantiquity, folk-lore, is almost inevitable for a single man in his\nposition. He was given to geometry also, propounding occasionally\nimpossible problems in the _Educational Times_, but ornithology was his\n_forte_. He had already added two visitors to the list of occasional\nBritish birds. His name was well-known in the columns of the _Zoologist_\n(I am afraid it may be forgotten by now, for the world moves apace). And\non the day after the coming of the Strange Bird, came first one and then\nanother to confirm the ploughman's story and tell him, not that it had\nany connection, of the Glare upon Sidderford moor.\n\nNow, the Vicar of Siddermorton had two rivals in his scientific\npursuits; Gully of Sidderton, who had actually seen the glare, and who\nit was sent the drawing to _Nature_, and Borland the natural history\ndealer, who kept the marine laboratory at Portburdock. Borland, the\nVicar thought, should have stuck to his copepods, but instead he kept a\ntaxidermist, and took advantage of his littoral position to pick up rare\nsea birds. It was evident to anyone who knew anything of collecting that\nboth these men would be scouring the country after the strange visitant,\nbefore twenty-four hours were out.\n\nThe Vicar's eye rested on the back of Saunders' British Birds, for he\nwas in his study at the time. Already in two places there was entered:\n\"the only known British specimen was secured by the Rev. K. Hilyer,\nVicar of Siddermorton.\" A third such entry. He doubted if any other\ncollector had that.\n\nHe looked at his watch--_two_. He had just lunched, and usually he\n\"rested\" in the afternoon. He knew it would make him feel very\ndisagreeable if he went out into the hot sunshine--both on the top of\nhis head and generally. Yet Gully perhaps was out, prowling observant.\nSuppose it was something very good and Gully got it!\n\nHis gun stood in the corner. (The thing had iridiscent wings and pink\nlegs! The chromatic conflict was certainly exceedingly stimulating). He\ntook his gun.\n\nHe would have gone out by the glass doors and verandah, and down the\ngarden into the hill road, in order to avoid his housekeeper's eye. He\nknew his gun expeditions were not approved of. But advancing towards him\nup the garden, he saw the curate's wife and her two daughters, carrying\ntennis rackets. His curate's wife was a young woman of immense will, who\nused to play tennis on his lawn, and cut his roses, differ from him on\ndoctrinal points, and criticise his personal behaviour all over the\nparish. He went in abject fear of her, was always trying to propitiate\nher. But so far he had clung to his ornithology....\n\nHowever, he went out by the front door.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nIf it were not for collectors England would be full, so to speak, of\nrare birds and wonderful butterflies, strange flowers and a thousand\ninteresting things. But happily the collector prevents all that, either\nkilling with his own hands or, by buying extravagantly, procuring people\nof the lower classes to kill such eccentricities as appear. It makes\nwork for people, even though Acts of Parliament interfere. In this way,\nfor instance, he is killing off the chough in Cornwall, the Bath white\nbutterfly, the Queen of Spain Fritillary; and can plume himself upon the\nextermination of the Great Auk, and a hundred other rare birds and\nplants and insects. All that is the work of the collector and his glory\nalone. In the name of Science. And this is right and as it should be;\neccentricity, in fact, is immorality--think over it again if you do not\nthink so now--just as eccentricity in one's way of thinking is madness\n(I defy you to find another definition that will fit all the cases of\neither); and if a species is rare it follows that it is not Fitted to\nSurvive. The collector is after all merely like the foot soldier in the\ndays of heavy armour--he leaves the combatants alone and cuts the\nthroats of those who are overthrown. So one may go through England from\nend to end in the summer time and see only eight or ten commonplace wild\nflowers, and the commoner butterflies, and a dozen or so common birds,\nand never be offended by any breach of the monotony, any splash of\nstrange blossom or flutter of unknown wing. All the rest have been\n\"collected\" years ago. For which cause we should all love Collectors,\nand bear in mind what we owe them when their little collections are\ndisplayed. These camphorated little drawers of theirs, their glass cases\nand blotting-paper books, are the graves of the Rare and the Beautiful,\nthe symbols of the Triumph of Leisure (morally spent) over the Delights\nof Life. (All of which, as you very properly remark, has nothing\nwhatever to do with the Strange Bird.)\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThere is a place on the moor where the black water shines among the\nsucculent moss, and the hairy sundew, eater of careless insects, spreads\nits red-stained hungry hands to the God who gives his creatures--one to\nfeed another. On a ridge thereby grow birches with a silvery bark, and\nthe soft green of the larch mingles with the dark green fir. Thither\nthrough the honey humming heather came the Vicar, in the heat of the\nday, carrying a gun under his arm, a gun loaded with swanshot for the\nStrange Bird. And over his disengaged hand he carried a pocket\nhandkerchief wherewith, ever and again, he wiped his beady face.\n\nHe went by and on past the big pond and the pool full of brown leaves\nwhere the Sidder arises, and so by the road (which is at first sandy and\nthen chalky) to the little gate that goes into the park. There are seven\nsteps up to the gate and on the further side six down again--lest the\ndeer escape--so that when the Vicar stood in the gateway his head was\nten feet or more above the ground. And looking where a tumult of bracken\nfronds filled the hollow between two groups of beech, his eye caught\nsomething parti-coloured that wavered and went. Suddenly his face\ngleamed and his muscles grew tense; he ducked his head, clutched his gun\nwith both hands, and stood still. Then watching keenly, he came on down\nthe steps into the park, and still holding his gun in both hands, crept\nrather than walked towards the jungle of bracken.\n\nNothing stirred, and he almost feared that his eyes had played him\nfalse, until he reached the ferns and had gone rustling breast high into\nthem. Then suddenly rose something full of wavering colours, twenty\nyards or less in front of his face, and beating the air. In another\nmoment it had fluttered above the bracken and spread its pinions wide.\nHe saw what it was, his heart was in his mouth, and he fired out of pure\nsurprise and habit.\n\nThere was a scream of superhuman agony, the wings beat the air twice,\nand the victim came slanting swiftly downward and struck the ground--a\nstruggling heap of writhing body, broken wing and flying bloodstained\nplumes--upon the turfy slope behind.\n\nThe Vicar stood aghast, with his smoking gun in his hand. It was no bird\nat all, but a youth with an extremely beautiful face, clad in a robe of\nsaffron and with iridescent wings, across whose pinions great waves of\ncolour, flushes of purple and crimson, golden green and intense blue,\npursued one another as he writhed in his agony. Never had the Vicar seen\nsuch gorgeous floods of colour, not stained glass windows, not the wings\nof butterflies, not even the glories of crystals seen between prisms, no\ncolours on earth could compare with them. Twice the Angel raised\nhimself, only to fall over sideways again. Then the beating of the wings\ndiminished, the terrified face grew pale, the floods of colour abated,\nand suddenly with a sob he lay prone, and the changing hues of the\nbroken wings faded swiftly into one uniform dull grey hue.\n\n\"Oh! _what_ has happened to me?\" cried the Angel (for such it was),\nshuddering violently, hands outstretched and clutching the ground, and\nthen lying still.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the Vicar. \"I had no idea.\" He came forward cautiously.\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"I am afraid I have shot you.\"\n\nIt was the obvious remark.\n\nThe Angel seemed to become aware of his presence for the first time. He\nraised himself by one hand, his brown eyes stared into the Vicar's.\nThen, with a gasp, and biting his nether lip, he struggled into a\nsitting position and surveyed the Vicar from top to toe.\n\n\"A man!\" said the Angel, clasping his forehead; \"a man in the maddest\nblack clothes and without a feather upon him. Then I was not deceived. I\nam indeed in the Land of Dreams!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE VICAR AND THE ANGEL.\n\nVI.\n\n\nNow there are some things frankly impossible. The weakest intellect will\nadmit this situation is impossible. The _Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_ will probably say as\nmuch should it venture to review this. Sunbespattered ferns, spreading\nbeech trees, the Vicar and the gun are acceptable enough. But this Angel\nis a different matter. Plain sensible people will scarcely go on with\nsuch an extravagant book. And the Vicar fully appreciated this\nimpossibility. But he lacked decision. Consequently he went on with it,\nas you shall immediately hear. He was hot, it was after dinner, he was\nin no mood for mental subtleties. The Angel had him at a disadvantage,\nand further distracted him from the main issue by irrelevant iridescence\nand a violent fluttering. For the moment it never occurred to the Vicar\nto ask whether the Angel was possible or not. He accepted him in the\nconfusion of the moment, and the mischief was done. Put yourself in his\nplace, my dear _Athen\u00c3\u00a6um_. You go out shooting. You hit something. That\nalone would disconcert you. You find you have hit an Angel, and he\nwrithes about for a minute and then sits up and addresses you. He makes\nno apology for his own impossibility. Indeed, he carries the charge\nclean into your camp. \"A man!\" he says, pointing. \"A man in the maddest\nblack clothes and without a feather upon him. Then I was not deceived. I\nam indeed in the Land of Dreams!\" You _must_ answer him. Unless you take\nto your heels. Or blow his brains out with your second barrel as an\nescape from the controversy.\n\n\"The Land of Dreams! Pardon me if I suggest you have just come out of\nit,\" was the Vicar's remark.\n\n\"How can that be?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Your wing,\" said the Vicar, \"is bleeding. Before we talk, may I have\nthe pleasure--the melancholy pleasure--of tying it up? I am really most\nsincerely sorry....\" The Angel put his hand behind his back and winced.\n\nThe Vicar assisted his victim to stand up. The Angel turned gravely and\nthe Vicar, with numberless insignificant panting parentheses, carefully\nexamined the injured wings. (They articulated, he observed with\ninterest, to a kind of second glenoid on the outer and upper edge of the\nshoulder blade. The left wing had suffered little except the loss of\nsome of the primary wing-quills, and a shot or so in the _ala spuria_,\nbut the humerus bone of the right was evidently smashed.) The Vicar\nstanched the bleeding as well as he could and tied up the bone with his\npocket handkerchief and the neck wrap his housekeeper made him carry in\nall weathers.\n\n\"I'm afraid you will not be able to fly for some time,\" said he, feeling\nthe bone.\n\n\"I don't like this new sensation,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"The Pain when I feel your bone?\"\n\n\"The _what_?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"The Pain.\"\n\n\"'Pain'--you call it. No, I certainly don't like the Pain. Do you have\nmuch of this Pain in the Land of Dreams?\"\n\n\"A very fair share,\" said the Vicar. \"Is it new to you?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said the Angel. \"I don't like it.\"\n\n\"How curious!\" said the Vicar, and bit at the end of a strip of linen to\ntie a knot. \"I think this bandaging must serve for the present,\" he\nsaid. \"I've studied ambulance work before, but never the bandaging up of\nwing wounds. Is your Pain any better?\"\n\n\"It glows now instead of flashing,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I am afraid you will find it glow for some time,\" said the Vicar, still\nintent on the wound.\n\nThe Angel gave a shrug of the wing and turned round to look at the Vicar\nagain. He had been trying to keep an eye on the Vicar over his shoulder\nduring all their interview. He looked at him from top to toe with raised\neyebrows and a growing smile on his beautiful soft-featured face. \"It\nseems so odd,\" he said with a sweet little laugh, \"to be talking to a\nMan!\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said the Vicar, \"now that I come to think of it, it is\nequally odd to me that I should be talking to an Angel. I am a somewhat\nmatter-of-fact person. A Vicar has to be. Angels I have always regarded\nas--artistic conceptions----\"\n\n\"Exactly what we think of men.\"\n\n\"But surely you have seen so many men----\"\n\n\"Never before to-day. In pictures and books, times enough of course. But\nI have seen several since the sunrise, solid real men, besides a horse\nor so--those Unicorn things you know, without horns--and quite a number\nof those grotesque knobby things called 'cows.' I was naturally a little\nfrightened at so many mythical monsters, and came to hide here until it\nwas dark. I suppose it will be dark again presently like it was at\nfirst. _Phew!_ This Pain of yours is poor fun. I hope I shall wake up\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"I don't understand quite,\" said the Vicar, knitting his brows and\ntapping his forehead with his flat hand. \"Mythical monster!\" The worst\nthing he had been called for years hitherto was a 'mediaeval\nanachronism' (by an advocate of Disestablishment). \"Do I understand\nthat you consider me as--as something in a dream?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Angel smiling.\n\n\"And this world about me, these rugged trees and spreading fronds----\"\n\n\"Is all so _very_ dream like,\" said the Angel. \"Just exactly what one\ndreams of--or artists imagine.\"\n\n\"You have artists then among the Angels?\"\n\n\"All kinds of artists, Angels with wonderful imaginations, who invent\nmen and cows and eagles and a thousand impossible creatures.\"\n\n\"Impossible creatures!\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Impossible creatures,\" said the Angel. \"Myths.\"\n\n\"But I'm real!\" said the Vicar. \"I assure you I'm real.\"\n\nThe Angel shrugged his wings and winced and smiled. \"I can always tell\nwhen I am dreaming,\" he said.\n\n\"_You_--dreaming,\" said the Vicar. He looked round him.\n\n\"_You_ dreaming!\" he repeated. His mind worked diffusely.\n\nHe held out his hand with all his fingers moving. \"I have it!\" he said.\n\"I begin to see.\" A really brilliant idea was dawning upon his mind. He\nhad not studied mathematics at Cambridge for nothing, after all. \"Tell\nme please. Some animals of _your_ world ... of the Real World, real\nanimals you know.\"\n\n\"Real animals!\" said the Angel smiling. \"Why--there's Griffins and\nDragons--and Jabberwocks--and Cherubim--and Sphinxes--and the\nHippogriff--and Mermaids--and Satyrs--and....\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Vicar as the Angel appeared to be warming to his\nwork; \"thank you. That is _quite_ enough. I begin to understand.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, his face pursed up. \"Yes ... I begin to see it.\"\n\n\"See what?\" asked the Angel.\n\n\"The Griffins and Satyrs and so forth. It's as clear....\"\n\n\"I don't see them,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"No, the whole point is they are not to be seen in this world. But our\nmen with imaginations have told us all about them, you know. And even I\nat times ... there are places in this village where you must simply take\nwhat they set before you, or give offence--I, I say, have seen in my\ndreams Jabberwocks, Bogle brutes, Mandrakes.... From our point of view,\nyou know, they are Dream Creatures....\"\n\n\"Dream Creatures!\" said the Angel. \"How singular! This is a very curious\ndream. A kind of topsy-turvey one. You call men real and angels a myth.\nIt almost makes one think that in some odd way there must be two worlds\nas it were....\"\n\n\"At least Two,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Lying somewhere close together, and yet scarcely suspecting....\"\n\n\"As near as page to page of a book.\"\n\n\"Penetrating each other, living each its own life. This is really a\ndelicious dream!\"\n\n\"And never dreaming of each other.\"\n\n\"Except when people go a dreaming!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Angel thoughtfully. \"It must be something of the sort.\nAnd that reminds me. Sometimes when I have been dropping asleep, or\ndrowsing under the noon-tide sun, I have seen strange corrugated faces\njust like yours, going by me, and trees with green leaves upon them, and\nsuch queer uneven ground as this.... It must be so. I have fallen into\nanother world.\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" began the Vicar, \"at bedtime, when I have been just on the\nedge of consciousness, I have seen faces as beautiful as yours, and the\nstrange dazzling vistas of a wonderful scene, that flowed past me,\nwinged shapes soaring over it, and wonderful--sometimes terrible--forms\ngoing to and fro. I have even heard sweet music too in my ears.... It\nmay be that as we withdraw our attention from the world of sense, the\npressing world about us, as we pass into the twilight of repose, other\nworlds.... Just as we see the stars, those other worlds in space, when\nthe glare of day recedes.... And the artistic dreamers who see such\nthings most clearly....\"\n\nThey looked at one another.\n\n\"And in some incomprehensible manner I have fallen into this world of\nyours out of my own!\" said the Angel, \"into the world of my dreams,\ngrown real.\"\n\nHe looked about him. \"Into the world of my dreams.\"\n\n\"It is confusing,\" said the Vicar. \"It almost makes one think there may\nbe (ahem) Four Dimensions after all. In which case, of course,\" he went\non hurriedly--for he loved geometrical speculations and took a certain\npride in his knowledge of them--\"there may be any number of three\ndimensional universes packed side by side, and all dimly dreaming of one\nanother. There may be world upon world, universe upon universe. It's\nperfectly possible. There's nothing so incredible as the absolutely\npossible. But I wonder how you came to fall out of your world into\nmine....\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the Angel; \"There's deer and a stag! Just as they draw\nthem on the coats of arms. How grotesque it all seems! Can I really be\nawake?\"\n\nHe rubbed his knuckles into his eyes.\n\nThe half-dozen of dappled deer came in Indian file obliquely through the\ntrees and halted, watching. \"It's no dream--I am really a solid concrete\nAngel, in Dream Land,\" said the Angel. He laughed. The Vicar stood\nsurveying him. The Reverend gentleman was pulling his mouth askew after\na habit he had, and slowly stroking his chin. He was asking himself\nwhether he too was not in the Land of Dreams.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nNow in the land of the Angels, so the Vicar learnt in the course of many\nconversations, there is neither pain nor trouble nor death, marrying nor\ngiving in marriage, birth nor forgetting. Only at times new things\nbegin. It is a land without hill or dale, a wonderfully level land,\nglittering with strange buildings, with incessant sunlight or full moon,\nand with incessant breezes blowing through the \u00c3\u0086olian traceries of the\ntrees. It is Wonderland, with glittering seas hanging in the sky, across\nwhich strange fleets go sailing, none know whither. There the flowers\nglow in Heaven and the stars shine about one's feet and the breath of\nlife is a delight. The land goes on for ever--there is no solar system\nnor interstellar space such as there is in our universe--and the air\ngoes upward past the sun into the uttermost abyss of their sky. And\nthere is nothing but Beauty there--all the beauty in our art is but\nfeeble rendering of faint glimpses of that wonderful world, and our\ncomposers, our original composers, are those who hear, however faintly,\nthe dust of melody that drives before its winds. And the Angels, and\nwonderful monsters of bronze and marble and living fire, go to and fro\ntherein.\n\nIt is a land of Law--for whatever is, is under the law--but its laws\nall, in some strange way, differ from ours. Their geometry is different\nbecause their space has a curve in it so that all their planes are\ncylinders; and their law of Gravitation is not according to the law of\ninverse squares, and there are four-and-twenty primary colours instead\nof only three. Most of the fantastic things of our science are\ncommonplaces there, and all our earthly science would seem to them the\nmaddest dreaming. There are no flowers upon their plants, for instance,\nbut jets of coloured fire. That, of course, will seem mere nonsense to\nyou because you do not understand Most of what the Angel told the Vicar,\nindeed the Vicar could not realise, because his own experiences, being\nonly of this world of matter, warred against his understanding. It was\ntoo strange to imagine.\n\nWhat had jolted these twin universes together so that the Angel had\nfallen suddenly into Sidderford, neither the Angel nor the Vicar could\ntell. Nor for the matter of that could the author of this story. The\nauthor is concerned with the facts of the case, and has neither the\ndesire nor the confidence to explain them. Explanations are the fallacy\nof a scientific age. And the cardinal fact of the case is this, that out\nin Siddermorton Park, with the glory of some wonderful world where there\nis neither sorrow nor sighing, still clinging to him, on the 4th of\nAugust 1895, stood an Angel, bright and beautiful, talking to the Vicar\nof Siddermorton about the plurality of worlds. The author will swear to\nthe Angel, if need be; and there he draws the line.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n\"I have,\" said the Angel, \"a most unusual feeling--_here_. Have had\nsince sunrise. I don't remember ever having any feeling--_here_ before.\"\n\n\"Not pain, I hope,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Oh no! It is quite different from that--a kind of vacuous feeling.\"\n\n\"The atmospheric pressure, perhaps, is a little different,\" the Vicar\nbegan, feeling his chin.\n\n\"And do you know, I have also the most curious sensations in my\nmouth--almost as if--it's so absurd!--as if I wanted to stuff things\ninto it.\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" said the Vicar. \"Of course! You're hungry!\"\n\n\"Hungry!\" said the Angel. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Don't you eat?\"\n\n\"Eat! The word's quite new to me.\"\n\n\"Put food into your mouth, you know. One has to here. You will soon\nlearn. If you don't, you get thin and miserable, and suffer a great\ndeal--_pain_, you know--and finally you die.\"\n\n\"Die!\" said the Angel. \"That's another strange word!\"\n\n\"It's not strange here. It means leaving off, you know,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"We never leave off,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"You don't know what may happen to you in this world,\" said the Vicar,\nthinking him over. \"Possibly if you are feeling hungry, and can feel\npain and have your wings broken, you may even have to die before you get\nout of it again. At anyrate you had better try eating. For my own\npart--ahem!--there are many more disagreeable things.\"\n\n\"I suppose I _had_ better Eat,\" said the Angel. \"If it's not too\ndifficult. I don't like this 'Pain' of yours, and I don't like this\n'Hungry.' If your 'Die' is anything like it, I would prefer to Eat. What\na very odd world this is!\"\n\n\"To Die,\" said the Vicar, \"is generally considered worse than either\npain or hunger.... It depends.\"\n\n\"You must explain all that to me later,\" said the Angel. \"Unless I wake\nup. At present, please show me how to eat. If you will. I feel a kind of\nurgency....\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Vicar, and offered an elbow. \"If I may have the\npleasure of entertaining you. My house lies yonder--not a couple of\nmiles from here.\"\n\n\"_Your_ House!\" said the Angel a little puzzled; but he took the Vicar's\narm affectionately, and the two, conversing as they went, waded slowly\nthrough the luxuriant bracken, sun mottled under the trees, and on over\nthe stile in the park palings, and so across the bee-swarming heather\nfor a mile or more, down the hillside, home.\n\nYou would have been charmed at the couple could you have seen them. The\nAngel, slight of figure, scarcely five feet high, and with a beautiful,\nalmost effeminate face, such as an Italian old Master might have\npainted. (Indeed, there is one in the National Gallery [_Tobias and the\nAngel_, by some artist unknown] not at all unlike him so far as face and\nspirit go.) He was robed simply in a purple-wrought saffron blouse, bare\nkneed and bare-footed, with his wings (broken now, and a leaden grey)\nfolded behind him. The Vicar was a short, rather stout figure, rubicund,\nred-haired, clean-shaven, and with bright ruddy brown eyes. He wore a\npiebald straw hat with a black ribbon, a very neat white tie, and a fine\ngold watch-chain. He was so greatly interested in his companion that it\nonly occurred to him when he was in sight of the Vicarage that he had\nleft his gun lying just where he had dropped it amongst the bracken.\n\nHe was rejoiced to hear that the pain of the bandaged wing fell rapidly\nin intensity.\n\n\n\n\nPARENTHESIS ON ANGELS.\n\nIX.\n\n\nLet us be plain. The Angel of this story is the Angel of Art, not the\nAngel that one must be irreverent to touch--neither the Angel of\nreligious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief. The last we all know.\nShe is alone among the angelic hosts in being distinctly feminine: she\nwears a robe of immaculate, unmitigated white with sleeves, is fair,\nwith long golden tresses, and has eyes of the blue of Heaven. Just a\npure woman she is, pure maiden or pure matron, in her _robe de nuit_,\nand with wings attached to her shoulder blades. Her callings are\ndomestic and sympathetic, she watches over a cradle or assists a sister\nsoul heavenward. Often she bears a palm leaf, but one would not be\nsurprised if one met her carrying a warming-pan softly to some poor\nchilly sinner. She it was who came down in a bevy to Marguerite in\nprison, in the amended last scene in _Faust_ at the Lyceum, and the\ninteresting and improving little children that are to die young, have\nvisions of such angels in the novels of Mrs Henry Wood. This white\nwomanliness with her indescribable charm of lavender-like holiness, her\naroma of clean, methodical lives, is, it would seem after all, a purely\nTeutonic invention. Latin thought knows her not; the old masters have\nnone of her. She is of a piece with that gentle innocent ladylike school\nof art whereof the greatest triumph is \"a lump in one's throat,\" and\nwhere wit and passion, scorn and pomp, have no place. The white angel\nwas made in Germany, in the land of blonde women and the domestic\nsentiments. She comes to us cool and worshipful, pure and tranquil, as\nsilently soothing as the breadth and calmness of the starlit sky, which\nalso is so unspeakably dear to the Teutonic soul.... We do her\nreverence. And to the angels of the Hebrews, those spirits of power and\nmystery, to Raphael, Zadkiel, and Michael, of whom only Watts has caught\nthe shadow, of whom only Blake has seen the splendour, to them too, do\nwe do reverence.\n\nBut this Angel the Vicar shot is, we say, no such angel at all, but the\nAngel of Italian art, polychromatic and gay. He comes from the land of\nbeautiful dreams and not from any holier place. At best he is a popish\ncreature. Bear patiently, therefore, with his scattered remiges, and be\nnot hasty with your charge of irreverence before the story is read.\n\n\n\n\nAT THE VICARAGE.\n\nX.\n\n\nThe Curate's wife and her two daughters and Mrs Jehoram were still\nplaying at tennis on the lawn behind the Vicar's study, playing keenly\nand talking in gasps about paper patterns for blouses. But the Vicar\nforgot and came in that way.\n\nThey saw the Vicar's hat above the rhododendrons, and a bare curly head\nbeside him. \"I must ask him about Susan Wiggin,\" said the Curate's wife.\nShe was about to serve, and stood with a racket in one hand and a ball\nbetween the fingers of the other. \"_He_ really ought to have gone to see\nher--being the Vicar. Not George. I----_Ah!_\"\n\nFor the two figures suddenly turned the corner and were visible. The\nVicar, arm in arm with----\n\nYou see, it came on the Curate's wife suddenly. The Angel's face being\ntowards her she saw nothing of the wings. Only a face of unearthly\nbeauty in a halo of chestnut hair, and a graceful figure clothed in a\nsaffron garment that barely reached the knees. The thought of those\nknees flashed upon the Vicar at once. He too was horrorstruck. So were\nthe two girls and Mrs Jehoram. All horrorstruck. The Angel stared in\nastonishment at the horrorstruck group. You see, he had never seen\nanyone horrorstruck before.\n\n\"MIS--ter Hilyer!\" said the Curate's wife. \"This is _too_ much!\" She\nstood speechless for a moment. \"_Oh!_\"\n\nShe swept round upon the rigid girls. \"Come!\" The Vicar opened and shut\nhis voiceless mouth. The world hummed and spun about him. There was a\nwhirling of zephyr skirts, four impassioned faces sweeping towards the\nopen door of the passage that ran through the vicarage. He felt his\nposition went with them.\n\n\"Mrs Mendham,\" said the Vicar, stepping forward. \"Mrs Mendham. You don't\nunderstand----\"\n\n\"_Oh!_\" they all said again.\n\nOne, two, three, four skirts vanished in the doorway. The Vicar\nstaggered half way across the lawn and stopped, aghast. \"This comes,\" he\nheard the Curate's wife say, out of the depth of the passage, \"of having\nan unmarried vicar----.\" The umbrella stand wobbled. The front door of\nthe vicarage slammed like a minute gun. There was silence for a space.\n\n\"I might have thought,\" he said. \"She is always so hasty.\"\n\nHe put his hand to his chin--a habit with him. Then turned his face to\nhis companion. The Angel was evidently well bred. He was holding up Mrs\nJehoram's sunshade--she had left it on one of the cane chairs--and\nexamining it with extraordinary interest. He opened it. \"What a curious\nlittle mechanism!\" he said. \"What can it be for?\"\n\nThe Vicar did not answer. The angelic costume certainly was--the Vicar\nknew it was a case for a French phrase--but he could scarcely remember\nit. He so rarely used French. It was not _de trop_, he knew. Anything\nbut _de trop_. The Angel was _de trop_, but certainly not his costume.\nAh! _Sans culotte!_\n\nThe Vicar examined his visitor critically--for the first time. \"He\n_will_ be difficult to explain,\" he said to himself softly.\n\nThe Angel stuck the sunshade into the turf and went to smell the sweet\nbriar. The sunshine fell upon his brown hair and gave it almost the\nappearance of a halo. He pricked his finger. \"Odd!\" he said. \"Pain\nagain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Vicar, thinking aloud. \"He's very beautiful and curious\nas he is. I should like him best so. But I am afraid I must.\"\n\nHe approached the Angel with a nervous cough.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\n\"Those,\" said the Vicar, \"were ladies.\"\n\n\"How grotesque,\" said the Angel, smiling and smelling the sweet briar.\n\"And such quaint shapes!\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said the Vicar. \"Did you, _ahem_, notice how they behaved?\"\n\n\"They went away. Seemed, indeed, to run away. Frightened? I, of course,\nwas frightened at things without wings. I hope---- they were not\nfrightened at my wings?\"\n\n\"At your appearance generally,\" said the Vicar, glancing involuntarily\nat the pink feet.\n\n\"Dear me! It never occurred to me. I suppose I seemed as odd to them as\nyou did to me.\" He glanced down. \"And my feet. _You_ have hoofs like a\nhippogriff.\"\n\n\"Boots,\" corrected the Vicar.\n\n\"Boots, you call them! But anyhow, I am sorry I alarmed----\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the Vicar, stroking his chin, \"our ladies, _ahem_, have\npeculiar views--rather inartistic views--about, _ahem_, clothing.\nDressed as you are, I am afraid, I am really afraid that--beautiful as\nyour costume certainly is--you will find yourself somewhat, _ahem_,\nsomewhat isolated in society. We have a little proverb, 'When in Rome,\n_ahem_, one must do as the Romans do.' I can assure you that, assuming\nyou are desirous to, _ahem_, associate with us--during your involuntary\nstay----\"\n\nThe Angel retreated a step or so as the Vicar came nearer and nearer in\nhis attempt to be diplomatic and confidential. The beautiful face grew\nperplexed. \"I don't quite understand. Why do you keep making these\nnoises in your throat? Is it Die or Eat, or any of those....\"\n\n\"As your host,\" interrupted the Vicar, and stopped.\n\n\"As my host,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"_Would_ you object, pending more permanent arrangements, to invest\nyourself, _ahem_, in a suit, an entirely new suit I may say, like this I\nhave on?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the Angel. He retreated so as to take in the Vicar from top\nto toe. \"Wear clothes like yours!\" he said. He was puzzled but amused.\nHis eyes grew round and bright, his mouth puckered at the corners.\n\n\"Delightful!\" he said, clapping his hands together. \"What a mad, quaint\ndream this is! Where are they?\" He caught at the neck of the saffron\nrobe.\n\n\"Indoors!\" said the Vicar. \"This way. We will change--indoors!\"\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nSo the Angel was invested in a pair of nether garments of the Vicar's, a\nshirt, ripped down the back (to accommodate the wings), socks,\nshoes--the Vicar's dress shoes--collar, tie, and light overcoat. But\nputting on the latter was painful, and reminded the Vicar that the\nbandaging was temporary. \"I will ring for tea at once, and send Grummet\ndown for Crump,\" said the Vicar. \"And dinner shall be earlier.\" While\nthe Vicar shouted his orders on the landing rails, the Angel surveyed\nhimself in the cheval glass with immense delight. If he was a stranger\nto pain, he was evidently no stranger--thanks perhaps to dreaming--to\nthe pleasure of incongruity.\n\nThey had tea in the drawing-room. The Angel sat on the music stool\n(music stool because of his wings). At first he wanted to lie on the\nhearthrug. He looked much less radiant in the Vicar's clothes, than he\nhad done upon the moor when dressed in saffron. His face shone still,\nthe colour of his hair and cheeks was strangely bright, and there was a\nsuperhuman light in his eyes, but his wings under the overcoat gave him\nthe appearance of a hunchback. The garments, indeed, made quite a\nterrestrial thing of him, the trousers were puckered transversely, and\nthe shoes a size or so too large.\n\nHe was charmingly affable and quite ignorant of the most elementary\nfacts of civilization. Eating came without much difficulty, and the\nVicar had an entertaining time teaching him how to take tea. \"What a\nmess it is! What a dear grotesque ugly world you live in!\" said the\nAngel. \"Fancy stuffing things into your mouth! We use our mouths just to\ntalk and sing with. Our world, you know, is almost incurably beautiful.\nWe get so very little ugliness, that I find all this ... delightful.\"\n\nMrs Hinijer, the Vicar's housekeeper, looked at the Angel suspiciously\nwhen she brought in the tea. She thought him rather a \"queer customer.\"\nWhat she would have thought had she seen him in saffron no one can tell.\n\nThe Angel shuffled about the room with his cup of tea in one hand, and\nthe bread and butter in the other, and examined the Vicar's furniture.\nOutside the French windows, the lawn with its array of dahlias and\nsunflowers glowed in the warm sunlight, and Mrs Jehoram's sunshade stood\nthereon like a triangle of fire. He thought the Vicar's portrait over\nthe mantel very curious indeed, could not understand what it was there\nfor. \"You have yourself round,\" he said, _apropos_ of the portrait, \"Why\nwant yourself flat?\" and he was vastly amused at the glass fire screen.\nHe found the oak chairs odd--\"You're not square, are you?\" he said, when\nthe Vicar explained their use. \"_We_ never double ourselves up. We lie\nabout on the asphodel when we want to rest.\"\n\n\"The chair,\" said the Vicar, \"to tell you the truth, has always puzzled\n_me_. It dates, I think, from the days when the floors were cold and\nvery dirty. I suppose we have kept up the habit. It's become a kind of\ninstinct with us to sit on chairs. Anyhow, if I went to see one of my\nparishioners, and suddenly spread myself out on the floor--the natural\nway of it--I don't know what she would do. It would be all over the\nparish in no time. Yet it seems the natural method of reposing, to\nrecline. The Greeks and Romans----\"\n\n\"What is this?\" said the Angel abruptly.\n\n\"That's a stuffed kingfisher. I killed it.\"\n\n\"Killed it!\"\n\n\"Shot it,\" said the Vicar, \"with a gun.\"\n\n\"Shot! As you did me?\"\n\n\"I didn't kill you, you see. Fortunately.\"\n\n\"Is killing making like that?\"\n\n\"In a way.\"\n\n\"Dear me! And you wanted to make me like that--wanted to put glass eyes\nin me and string me up in a glass case full of ugly green and brown\nstuff?\"\n\n\"You see,\" began the Vicar, \"I scarcely understood----\"\n\n\"Is that 'die'?\" asked the Angel suddenly.\n\n\"That is dead; it died.\"\n\n\"Poor little thing. I must eat a lot. But you say you killed it. _Why?_\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the Vicar, \"I take an interest in birds, and I (_ahem_)\ncollect them. I wanted the specimen----\"\n\nThe Angel stared at him for a moment with puzzled eyes. \"A beautiful\nbird like that!\" he said with a shiver. \"Because the fancy took you. You\nwanted the specimen!\"\n\nHe thought for a minute. \"Do you often kill?\" he asked the Vicar.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN OF SCIENCE.\n\nXIII.\n\n\nThen Doctor Crump arrived. Grummet had met him not a hundred yards from\nthe vicarage gate. He was a large, rather heavy-looking man, with a\nclean-shaven face and a double chin. He was dressed in a grey morning\ncoat (he always affected grey), with a chequered black and white tie.\n\"What's the trouble?\" he said, entering and staring without a shadow of\nsurprise at the Angel's radiant face.\n\n\"This--_ahem_--gentleman,\" said the Vicar, \"or--_ah_--Angel\"--the Angel\nbowed--\"is suffering from a gunshot wound.\"\n\n\"Gunshot wound!\" said Doctor Crump. \"In July! May I look at it,\nMr--Angel, I think you said?\"\n\n\"He will probably be able to assuage your pain,\" said the Vicar. \"Let\nme assist you to remove your coat?\"\n\nThe Angel turned obediently.\n\n\"Spinal curvature?\" muttered Doctor Crump quite audibly, walking round\nbehind the Angel. \"No! abnormal growth. Hullo! This is odd!\" He clutched\nthe left wing. \"Curious,\" he said. \"Reduplication of the anterior\nlimb--bifid coracoid. Possible, of course, but I've never seen it\nbefore.\" The angel winced under his hands. \"Humerus. Radius and Ulna.\nAll there. Congenital, of course. Humerus broken. Curious integumentary\nsimulation of feathers. Dear me. Almost avian. Probably of considerable\ninterest in comparative anatomy. I never did!----How did this gunshot\nhappen, Mr Angel?\"\n\nThe Vicar was amazed at the Doctor's matter-of-fact manner.\n\n\"Our friend,\" said the Angel, moving his head at the Vicar.\n\n\"Unhappily it is my doing,\" said the Vicar, stepping forward,\nexplanatory. \"I mistook the gentleman--the Angel (_ahem_)--for a large\nbird----\"\n\n\"Mistook him for a large bird! What next? Your eyes want seeing to,\"\nsaid Doctor Crump. \"I've told you so before.\" He went on patting and\nfeeling, keeping time with a series of grunts and inarticulate\nmutterings.... \"But this is really a very good bit of amateur\nbandaging,\" said he. \"I think I shall leave it. Curious malformation\nthis is! Don't you find it inconvenient, Mr Angel?\"\n\nHe suddenly walked round so as to look in the Angel's face.\n\nThe Angel thought he referred to the wound. \"It is rather,\" he said.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the bones I should say paint with iodine night and\nmorning. Nothing like iodine. You could paint your face flat with it.\nBut the osseous outgrowth, the bones, you know, complicate things. I\ncould saw them off, of course. It's not a thing one should have done in\na hurry----\"\n\n\"Do you mean my wings?\" said the Angel in alarm.\n\n\"Wings!\" said the Doctor. \"Eigh? Call 'em wings! Yes--what else should I\nmean?\"\n\n\"Saw them off!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Don't you think so? It's of course your affair. I am only advising----\"\n\n\"Saw them off! What a funny creature you are!\" said the Angel, beginning\nto laugh.\n\n\"As you will,\" said the Doctor. He detested people who laughed. \"The\nthings are curious,\" he said, turning to the Vicar. \"If\ninconvenient\"--to the Angel. \"I never heard of such complete\nreduplication before--at least among animals. In plants it's common\nenough. Were you the only one in your family?\" He did not wait for a\nreply. \"Partial cases of the fission of limbs are not at all uncommon,\nof course, Vicar--six-fingered children, calves with six feet, and cats\nwith double toes, you know. May I assist you?\" he said, turning to the\nAngel who was struggling with the coat. \"But such a complete\nreduplication, and so avian, too! It would be much less remarkable if it\nwas simply another pair of arms.\"\n\nThe coat was got on and he and the Angel stared at one another.\n\n\"Really,\" said the Doctor, \"one begins to understand how that beautiful\nmyth of the angels arose. You look a little hectic, Mr Angel--feverish.\nExcessive brilliance is almost worse as a symptom than excessive pallor.\nCurious your name should be Angel. I must send you a cooling draught, if\nyou should feel thirsty in the night....\"\n\nHe made a memorandum on his shirt cuff. The Angel watched him\nthoughtfully, with the dawn of a smile in his eyes.\n\n\"One minute, Crump,\" said the Vicar, taking the Doctor's arm and leading\nhim towards the door.\n\nThe Angel's smile grew brighter. He looked down at his black-clad legs.\n\"He positively thinks I am a man!\" said the Angel. \"What he makes of the\nwings beats me altogether. What a queer creature he must be! This is\nreally a most extraordinary Dream!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\n\"That _is_ an Angel,\" whispered the Vicar. \"You don't understand.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" said the Doctor in a quick, sharp voice. His eyebrows went up\nand he smiled.\n\n\"But the wings?\"\n\n\"Quite natural, quite ... if a little abnormal.\"\n\n\"Are you sure they are natural?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, everything that is, is natural. There is nothing\nunnatural in the world. If I thought there was I should give up practice\nand go into _Le Grand Chartreuse_. There are abnormal phenomena, of\ncourse. And----\"\n\n\"But the way I came upon him,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Yes, tell me where you picked him up,\" said the Doctor. He sat down on\nthe hall table.\n\nThe Vicar began rather hesitatingly--he was not very good at story\ntelling--with the rumours of a strange great bird. He told the story in\nclumsy sentences--for, knowing the Bishop as he did, with that awful\nexample always before him he dreaded getting his pulpit style into his\ndaily conversation--and at every third sentence or so, the Doctor made a\ndownward movement of his head--the corners of his mouth tucked away, so\nto speak--as though he ticked off the phases of the story and so far\nfound it just as it ought to be. \"Self-hypnotism,\" he murmured once.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the Doctor. \"Nothing, I assure you. Go on. This is\nextremely interesting.\"\n\nThe Vicar told him he went out with his gun.\n\n\"_After_ lunch, I think you said?\" interrupted the Doctor.\n\n\"Immediately after,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"You should not do such things, you know. But go on, please.\"\n\nHe came to the glimpse of the Angel from the gate.\n\n\"In the full glare,\" said the Doctor, in parenthesis. \"It was\nseventy-nine in the shade.\"\n\nWhen the Vicar had finished, the Doctor pressed his lips together\ntighter than ever, smiled faintly, and looked significantly into the\nVicar's eyes.\n\n\"You don't ...\" began the Vicar, falteringly.\n\nThe Doctor shook his head. \"Forgive me,\" he said, putting his hand on\nthe Vicar's arm.\n\n\"You go out,\" he said, \"on a hot lunch and on a hot afternoon. Probably\nover eighty. Your mind, what there is of it, is whirling with avian\nexpectations. I say, 'what there is of it,' because most of your nervous\nenergy is down there, digesting your dinner. A man who has been lying in\nthe bracken stands up before you and you blaze away. Over he goes--and\nas it happens--as it happens--he has reduplicate fore-limbs, one pair\nbeing not unlike wings. It's a coincidence certainly. And as for his\niridescent colours and so forth----. Have you never had patches of\ncolour swim before your eyes before, on a brilliant sunlight day?... Are\nyou sure they were confined to the wings? Think.\"\n\n\"But he says he _is_ an Angel!\" said the Vicar, staring out of his\nlittle round eyes, his plump hands in his pockets.\n\n\"_Ah!_\" said the Doctor with his eye on the Vicar. \"I expected as\nmuch.\" He paused.\n\n\"But don't you think ...\" began the Vicar.\n\n\"That man,\" said the Doctor in a low, earnest voice, \"is a mattoid.\"\n\n\"A what?\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"A mattoid. An abnormal man. Did you notice the effeminate delicacy of\nhis face? His tendency to quite unmeaning laughter? His neglected hair?\nThen consider his singular dress....\"\n\nThe Vicar's hand went up to his chin.\n\n\"Marks of mental weakness,\" said the Doctor. \"Many of this type of\ndegenerate show this same disposition to assume some vast mysterious\ncredentials. One will call himself the Prince of Wales, another the\nArchangel Gabriel, another the Deity even. Ibsen thinks he is a Great\nTeacher, and Maeterlink a new Shakespeare. I've just been reading all\nabout it--in Nordau. No doubt his odd deformity gave him an idea....\"\n\n\"But really,\" began the Vicar.\n\n\"No doubt he's slipped away from confinement.\"\n\n\"I do not altogether accept....\"\n\n\"You will. If not, there's the police, and failing that, advertisement;\nbut, of course, his people may want to hush it up. It's a sad thing in a\nfamily....\"\n\n\"He seems so altogether....\"\n\n\"Probably you'll hear from his friends in a day or so,\" said the Doctor,\nfeeling for his watch. \"He can't live far from here, I should think. He\nseems harmless enough. I must come along and see that wing again\nto-morrow.\" He slid off the hall table and stood up.\n\n\"Those old wives' tales still have their hold on you,\" he said, patting\nthe Vicar on the shoulder. \"But an angel, you know--Ha, ha!\"\n\n\"I certainly _did_ think....\" said the Vicar dubiously.\n\n\"Weigh the evidence,\" said the Doctor, still fumbling at his watch.\n\"Weigh the evidence with our instruments of precision. What does it\nleave you? Splashes of colour, spots of fancy--_muscae volantes_.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said the Vicar, \"I could almost swear to the glory on his\nwings....\"\n\n\"Think it over,\" said the Doctor (watch out); \"hot afternoon--brilliant\nsunshine--boiling down on your head.... But really I _must_ be going. It\nis a quarter to five. I'll see your--angel (ha, ha!) to-morrow again, if\nno one has been to fetch him in the meanwhile. Your bandaging was really\nvery good. I flatter _myself_ on that score. Our ambulance classes\n_were_ a success you see.... Good afternoon.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE CURATE.\n\nXV.\n\n\nThe Vicar opened the door half mechanically to let out Crump, and saw\nMendham, his curate, coming up the pathway by the hedge of purple vetch\nand meadowsweet. At that his hand went up to his chin and his eyes grew\nperplexed. Suppose he _was_ deceived. The Doctor passed the Curate with\na sweep of his hand from his hat brim. Crump was an extraordinarily\nclever fellow, the Vicar thought, and knew far more of anyone's brain\nthan one did oneself. The Vicar felt that so acutely. It made the coming\nexplanation difficult. Suppose he were to go back into the drawing-room,\nand find just a tramp asleep on the hearthrug.\n\nMendham was a cadaverous man with a magnificent beard. He looked,\nindeed, as though he had run to beard as a mustard plant does to seed.\nBut when he spoke you found he had a voice as well.\n\n\"My wife came home in a dreadful state,\" he brayed out at long range.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the Vicar; \"come in. Most remarkable occurrence. Please\ncome in. Come into the study. I'm really dreadfully sorry. But when I\nexplain....\"\n\n\"And apologise, I hope,\" brayed the Curate.\n\n\"And apologise. No, not that way. This way. The study.\"\n\n\"Now what _was_ that woman?\" said the Curate, turning on the Vicar as\nthe latter closed the study door.\n\n\"What woman?\"\n\n\"Pah!\"\n\n\"But really!\"\n\n\"The painted creature in light attire--disgustingly light attire, to\nspeak freely--with whom you were promenading the garden.\"\n\n\"My dear Mendham--that was an Angel!\"\n\n\"A very pretty Angel?\"\n\n\"The world is getting so matter-of-fact,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"The world,\" roared the Curate, \"grows blacker every day. But to find a\nman in your position, shamelessly, openly....\"\n\n\"_Bother!_\" said the Vicar aside. He rarely swore. \"Look here, Mendham,\nyou really misunderstand. I can assure you....\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Curate. \"Explain!\" He stood with his lank legs\napart, his arms folded, scowling at his Vicar over his big beard.\n\n(Explanations, I repeat, I have always considered the peculiar fallacy\nof this scientific age.)\n\nThe Vicar looked about him helplessly. The world had all gone dull and\ndead. Had he been dreaming all the afternoon? Was there really an angel\nin the drawing-room? Or was he the sport of a complicated hallucination?\n\n\"Well?\" said Mendham, at the end of a minute.\n\nThe Vicar's hand fluttered about his chin. \"It's such a round-about\nstory,\" he said.\n\n\"No doubt it will be,\" said Mendham harshly.\n\nThe Vicar restrained a movement of impatience.\n\n\"I went out to look for a strange bird this afternoon.... Do you\nbelieve in angels, Mendham, real angels?\"\n\n\"I'm not here to discuss theology. I am the husband of an insulted\nwoman.\"\n\n\"But I tell you it's not a figure of speech; this _is_ an angel, a real\nangel with wings. He's in the next room now. You do misunderstand me,\nso....\"\n\n\"Really, Hilyer--\"\n\n\"It is true I tell you, Mendham. I swear it is true.\" The Vicar's voice\ngrew impassioned. \"What sin I have done that I should entertain and\nclothe angelic visitants, I don't know. I only know that--inconvenient\nas it undoubtedly will be--I have an angel now in the drawing-room,\nwearing my new suit and finishing his tea. And he's stopping with me,\nindefinitely, at my invitation. No doubt it was rash of me. But I can't\nturn him out, you know, because Mrs Mendham----I may be a weakling, but\nI am still a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Really, Hilyer--\"\n\n\"I can assure you it is true.\" There was a note of hysterical\ndesperation in the Vicar's voice. \"I fired at him, taking him for a\nflamingo, and hit him in the wing.\"\n\n\"I thought this was a case for the Bishop. I find it is a case for the\nLunacy Commissioners.\"\n\n\"Come and see him, Mendham!\"\n\n\"But there _are_ no angels.\"\n\n\"We teach the people differently,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Not as material bodies,\" said the Curate.\n\n\"Anyhow, come and see him.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see your hallucinations,\" began the Curate.\n\n\"I can't explain anything unless you come and see him,\" said the Vicar.\n\"A man who's more like an angel than anything else in heaven or earth.\nYou simply must see if you wish to understand.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to understand,\" said the Curate. \"I don't wish to lend\nmyself to any imposture. Surely, Hilyer, if this is not an imposition,\nyou can tell me yourself.... Flamingo, indeed!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nThe Angel had finished his tea and was standing looking pensively out of\nthe window. He thought the old church down the valley lit by the light\nof the setting sun was very beautiful, but he could not understand the\nserried ranks of tombstones that lay up the hillside beyond. He turned\nas Mendham and the Vicar came in.\n\nNow Mendham could bully his Vicar cheerfully enough, just as he could\nbully his congregation; but he was not the sort of man to bully a\nstranger. He looked at the Angel, and the \"strange woman\" theory was\ndisposed of. The Angel's beauty was too clearly the beauty of the youth.\n\n\"Mr Hilyer tells me,\" Mendham began, in an almost apologetic tone, \"that\nyou--ah--it's so curious--claim to be an Angel.\"\n\n\"_Are_ an Angel,\" said the Vicar.\n\nThe Angel bowed.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Mendham, \"we are curious.\"\n\n\"Very,\" said the Angel. \"The blackness and the shape.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Mendham.\n\n\"The blackness and the flaps,\" repeated the Angel; \"and no wings.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Mendham, who was altogether at a loss. \"We are, of\ncourse, curious to know something of how you came into the village in\nsuch a peculiar costume.\"\n\nThe Angel looked at the Vicar. The Vicar touched his chin.\n\n\"You see,\" began the Vicar.\n\n\"Let _him_ explain,\" said Mendham; \"I beg.\"\n\n\"I wanted to suggest,\" began the Vicar.\n\n\"And I don't want you to suggest.\"\n\n\"_Bother!_\" said the Vicar.\n\nThe Angel looked from one to the other. \"Such rugose expressions flit\nacross your faces!\" he said.\n\n\"You see, Mr--Mr--I don't know your name,\" said Mendham, with a certain\ndiminution of suavity. \"The case stands thus: My wife--four ladies, I\nmight say--are playing lawn tennis, when you suddenly rush out on them,\nsir; you rush out on them from among the rhododendra in a very defective\ncostume. You and Mr Hilyer.\"\n\n\"But I--\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"I know. It was this gentleman's costume was defective. Naturally--it is\nmy place in fact--to demand an explanation.\" His voice was growing in\nvolume. \"And I _must_ demand an explanation.\"\n\nThe Angel smiled faintly at his note of anger and his sudden attitude of\ndetermination--arms tightly folded.\n\n\"I am rather new to the world,\" the Angel began.\n\n\"Nineteen at least,\" said Mendham. \"Old enough to know better. That's a\npoor excuse.\"\n\n\"May I ask one question first?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Do you think I am a Man--like yourself? As the chequered man did.\"\n\n\"If you are not a man--\"\n\n\"One other question. Have you _never_ heard of an Angel?\"\n\n\"I warn you not to try that story upon me,\" said Mendham, now back at\nhis familiar crescendo.\n\nThe Vicar interrupted: \"But Mendham--he has wings!\"\n\n\"_Please_ let me talk to him,\" said Mendham.\n\n\"You are so quaint,\" said the Angel; \"you interrupt everything I have to\nsay.\"\n\n\"But what _have_ you to say?\" said Mendham.\n\n\"That I really _am_ an Angel....\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\"\n\n\"There you go!\"\n\n\"But tell me, honestly, how you came to be in the shrubbery of\nSiddermorton Vicarage--in the state in which you were. And in the\nVicar's company. Cannot you abandon this ridiculous story of yours?...\"\n\nThe Angel shrugged his wings. \"What is the matter with this man?\" he\nsaid to the Vicar.\n\n\"My dear Mendham,\" said the Vicar, \"a few words from me....\"\n\n\"Surely my question is straightforward enough!\"\n\n\"But you won't tell me the answer you want, and it's no good my telling\nyou any other.\"\n\n\"_Pshaw!_\" said the Curate again. And then turning suddenly on the\nVicar, \"Where does he come from?\"\n\nThe Vicar was in a dreadful state of doubt by this time.\n\n\"He _says_ he is an Angel!\" said the Vicar. \"Why don't you listen to\nhim?\"\n\n\"No angel would alarm four ladies....\"\n\n\"Is _that_ what it is all about?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Enough cause too, I should think!\" said the Curate.\n\n\"But I really did not know,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"This is altogether too much!\"\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry I alarmed these ladies.\"\n\n\"You ought to be. But I see I shall get nothing out of you two.\" Mendham\nwent towards the door. \"I am convinced there is something discreditable\nat the bottom of this business. Or why not tell a simple straightforward\nstory? I will confess you puzzle me. Why, in this enlightened age, you\nshould tell this fantastic, this far-fetched story of an Angel,\naltogether beats me. What good _can_ it do?...\"\n\n\"But stop and look at his wings!\" said the Vicar. \"I can assure you he\nhas wings!\"\n\nMendham had his fingers on the door-handle. \"I have seen quite enough,\"\nhe said. \"It may be this is simply a foolish attempt at a hoax, Hilyer.\"\n\n\"But Mendham!\" said the Vicar.\n\nThe Curate halted in the doorway and looked at the Vicar over his\nshoulder. The accumulating judgment of months found vent. \"I cannot\nunderstand, Hilyer, why you are in the Church. For the life of me I\ncannot. The air is full of Social Movements, of Economic change, the\nWoman Movement, Rational Dress, The Reunion of Christendom, Socialism,\nIndividualism--all the great and moving Questions of the Hour! Surely,\nwe who follow the Great Reformer.... And here you are stuffing birds,\nand startling ladies with your callous disregard....\"\n\n\"But Mendham,\" began the Vicar.\n\nThe Curate would not hear him. \"You shame the Apostles with your\nlevity.... But this is only a preliminary enquiry,\" he said, with a\nthreatening note in his sonorous voice, and so vanished abruptly (with a\nviolent slam) from the room.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\n\"Are _all_ men so odd as this?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I'm in such a difficult position,\" said the Vicar. \"You see,\" he said,\nand stopped, searching his chin for an idea.\n\n\"I'm beginning to see,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"They won't believe it.\"\n\n\"I see that.\"\n\n\"They will think I tell lies.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"That will be extremely painful to me.\"\n\n\"Painful!... Pain,\" said the Angel. \"I hope not.\"\n\nThe Vicar shook his head. The good report of the village had been the\nbreath of his life, so far. \"You see,\" he said, \"it would look so much\nmore plausible if you said you were just a man.\"\n\n\"But I'm not,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"No, you're not,\" said the Vicar. \"So that's no good.\"\n\n\"Nobody here, you know, has ever seen an Angel, or heard of one--except\nin church. If you had made your _debut_ in the chancel--on Sunday--it\nmight have been different. But that's too late now.... (_Bother!_)\nNobody, absolutely nobody, will believe in you.\"\n\n\"I hope I am not inconveniencing you?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the Vicar; \"not at all. Only----. Naturally it may be\ninconvenient if you tell a too incredible story. If I might suggest\n(_ahem_)----.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You see, people in the world, being men themselves, will almost\ncertainly regard you as a man. If you say you are not, they will simply\nsay you do not tell the truth. Only exceptional people appreciate the\nexceptional. When in Rome one must--well, respect Roman prejudices a\nlittle--talk Latin. You will find it better----\"\n\n\"You propose I should feign to become a man?\"\n\n\"You have my meaning at once.\"\n\nThe Angel stared at the Vicar's hollyhocks and thought.\n\n\"Possibly, after all,\" he said slowly, \"I _shall_ become a man. I may\nhave been too hasty in saying I was not. You say there are no angels in\nthis world. Who am I to set myself up against your experience? A mere\nthing of a day--so far as this world goes. If you say there are no\nangels--clearly I must be something else. I eat--angels do not eat. I\n_may_ be a man already.\"\n\n\"A convenient view, at any rate,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"If it is convenient to you----\"\n\n\"It is. And then to account for your presence here.\"\n\n\"_If_,\" said the Vicar, after a hesitating moment of reflection, \"if,\nfor instance, you had been an ordinary man with a weakness for wading,\nand you had gone wading in the Sidder, and your clothes had been stolen,\nfor instance, and I had come upon you in that position of inconvenience;\nthe explanation I shall have to make to Mrs Mendham----would be shorn at\nleast of the supernatural element. There is such a feeling against the\nsupernatural element nowadays--even in the pulpit. You would hardly\nbelieve----\"\n\n\"It's a pity that was not the case,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Vicar. \"It is a great pity that was not the case.\nBut at anyrate you will oblige me if you do not obtrude your angelic\nnature. You will oblige everyone, in fact. There is a settled opinion\nthat angels do not do this kind of thing. And nothing is more\npainful--as I can testify--than a decaying settled opinion.... Settled\nopinions are mental teeth in more ways than one. For my own part,\"--the\nVicar's hand passed over his eyes for a moment--\"I cannot but believe\nyou are an angel.... Surely I can believe my own eyes.\"\n\n\"We always do ours,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"And so do we, within limits.\"\n\nThen the clock upon the mantel chimed seven, and almost simultaneously\nMrs Hinijer announced dinner.\n\n\n\n\nAFTER DINNER.\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nThe Angel and the Vicar sat at dinner. The Vicar, with his napkin tucked\nin at his neck, watched the Angel struggling with his soup. \"You will\nsoon get into the way of it,\" said the Vicar. The knife and fork\nbusiness was done awkwardly but with effect. The Angel looked furtively\nat Delia, the little waiting maid. When presently they sat cracking\nnuts--which the Angel found congenial enough--and the girl had gone, the\nAngel asked: \"Was that a lady, too?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Vicar (_crack_). \"No--she is not a lady. She is a\nservant.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Angel; \"she _had_ rather a nicer shape.\"\n\n\"You mustn't tell Mrs Mendham that,\" said the Vicar, covertly satisfied.\n\n\"She didn't stick out so much at the shoulders and hips, and there was\nmore of her in between. And the colour of her robes was not\ndiscordant--simply neutral. And her face----\"\n\n\"Mrs Mendham and her daughters had been playing tennis,\" said the Vicar,\nfeeling he ought not to listen to detraction even of his mortal enemy.\n\"Do you like these things--these nuts?\"\n\n\"Very much,\" said the Angel. _Crack._\n\n\"You see,\" said the Vicar (_Chum, chum, chum_). \"For my own part I\nentirely believe you are an angel.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I shot you--I saw you flutter. It's beyond dispute. In my own mind. I\nadmit it's curious and against my preconceptions, but--practically--I'm\nassured, perfectly assured in fact, that I saw what I certainly did see.\nBut after the behaviour of these people. (_Crack_). I really don't see\nhow we are to persuade people. Nowadays people are so very particular\nabout evidence. So that I think there is a great deal to be said for the\nattitude you assume. Temporarily at least I think it would be best of\nyou to do as you propose to do, and behave as a man as far as possible.\nOf course there is no knowing how or when you may go back. After what\nhas happened (_Gluck_, _gluck_, _gluck_--as the Vicar refills his\nglass)--after what has happened I should not be surprised to see the\nside of the room fall away, and the hosts of heaven appear to take you\naway again--take us both away even. You have so far enlarged my\nimagination. All these years I have been forgetting Wonderland. But\nstill----. It will certainly be wiser to break the thing gently to\nthem.\"\n\n\"This life of yours,\" said the Angel. \"I'm still in the dark about it.\nHow do you begin?\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said the Vicar. \"Fancy having to explain that! We begin\nexistence here, you know, as babies, silly pink helpless things wrapped\nin white, with goggling eyes, that yelp dismally at the Font. Then these\nbabies grow larger and become even beautiful--when their faces are\nwashed. And they continue to grow to a certain size. They become\nchildren, boys and girls, youths and maidens (_Crack_), young men and\nyoung women. That is the finest time in life, according to\nmany--certainly the most beautiful. Full of great hopes and dreams,\nvague emotions and unexpected dangers.\"\n\n\"_That_ was a maiden?\" said the Angel, indicating the door through which\nDelia had disappeared.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Vicar, \"that was a maiden.\" And paused thoughtfully.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Vicar, \"the glamour fades and life begins in earnest.\nThe young men and young women pair off--most of them. They come to me\nshy and bashful, in smart ugly dresses, and I marry them. And then\nlittle pink babies come to them, and some of the youths and maidens that\nwere, grow fat and vulgar, and some grow thin and shrewish, and their\npretty complexions go, and they get a queer delusion of superiority over\nthe younger people, and all the delight and glory goes out of their\nlives. So they call the delight and glory of the younger ones, Illusion.\nAnd then they begin to drop to pieces.\"\n\n\"Drop to pieces!\" said the Angel. \"How grotesque!\"\n\n\"Their hair comes off and gets dull coloured or ashen grey,\" said the\nVicar. \"_I_, for instance.\" He bowed his head forward to show a circular\nshining patch the size of a florin. \"And their teeth come out. Their\nfaces collapse and become as wrinkled and dry as a shrivelled apple.\n'Corrugated' you called mine. They care more and more for what they have\nto eat and to drink, and less and less for any of the other delights of\nlife. Their limbs get loose in the joints, and their hearts slack, or\nlittle pieces from their lungs come coughing up. Pain....\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Pain comes into their lives more and more. And then they go. They do\nnot like to go, but they have to--out of this world, very reluctantly,\nclutching its pain at last in their eagerness to stop....\"\n\n\"Where do they go?\"\n\n\"Once I thought I knew. But now I am older I know I do not know. We have\na Legend--perhaps it is not a legend. One may be a churchman and\ndisbelieve. Stokes says there is nothing in it....\" The Vicar shook his\nhead at the bananas.\n\n\"And you?\" said the Angel. \"Were you a little pink baby?\"\n\n\"A little while ago I was a little pink baby.\"\n\n\"Were you robed then as you are now?\"\n\n\"Oh no! Dear me! What a queer idea! Had long white clothes, I suppose,\nlike the rest of them.\"\n\n\"And then you were a little boy?\"\n\n\"A little boy.\"\n\n\"And then a glorious youth?\"\n\n\"I was not a very glorious youth, I am afraid. I was sickly, and too\npoor to be radiant, and with a timid heart. I studied hard and pored\nover the dying thoughts of men long dead. So I lost the glory, and no\nmaiden came to me, and the dulness of life began too soon.\"\n\n\"And you have your little pink babies?\"\n\n\"None,\" said the Vicar with a scarce perceptible pause. \"Yet all the\nsame, as you see, I am beginning to drop to pieces. Presently my back\nwill droop like a wilting flowerstalk. And then, in a few thousand days\nmore I shall be done with, and I shall go out of this world of mine....\nWhither I do not know.\"\n\n\"And you have to eat like this every day?\"\n\n\"Eat, and get clothes and keep this roof above me. There are some very\ndisagreeable things in this world called Cold and Rain. And the other\npeople here--how and why is too long a story--have made me a kind of\nchorus to their lives. They bring their little pink babies to me and I\nhave to say a name and some other things over each new pink baby. And\nwhen the children have grown to be youths and maidens, they come again\nand are confirmed. You will understand that better later. Then before\nthey may join in couples and have pink babies of their own, they must\ncome again and hear me read out of a book. They would be outcast, and no\nother maiden would speak to the maiden who had a little pink baby\nwithout I had read over her for twenty minutes out of my book. It's a\nnecessary thing, as you will see. Odd as it may seem to you. And\nafterwards when they are falling to pieces, I try and persuade them of a\nstrange world in which I scarcely believe myself, where life is\naltogether different from what they have had--or desire. And in the\nend, I bury them, and read out of my book to those who will presently\nfollow into the unknown land. I stand at the beginning, and at the\nzenith, and at the setting of their lives. And on every seventh day, I\nwho am a man myself, I who see no further than they do, talk to them of\nthe Life to Come--the life of which we know nothing. If such a life\nthere be. And slowly I drop to pieces amidst my prophesying.\"\n\n\"What a strange life!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Vicar. \"What a strange life! But the thing that makes it\nstrange to me is new. I had taken it as a matter of course until you\ncame into my life.\"\n\n\"This life of ours is so insistent,\" said the Vicar. \"It, and its petty\nneeds, its temporary pleasures (_Crack_) swathe our souls about. While I\nam preaching to these people of mine of another life, some are\nministering to one appetite and eating sweets, others--the old men--are\nslumbering, the youths glance at the maidens, the grown men protrude\nwhite waistcoats and gold chains, pomp and vanity on a substratum of\ncarnal substance, their wives flaunt garish bonnets at one another. And\nI go on droning away of the things unseen and unrealised--'Eye hath not\nseen,' I read, 'nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the imagination\nof man to conceive,' and I look up to catch an adult male immortal\nadmiring the fit of a pair of three and sixpenny gloves. It is damping\nyear after year. When I was ailing in my youth I felt almost the\nassurance of vision that beneath this temporary phantasm world was the\nreal world--the enduring world of the Life Everlasting. But now----\"\n\nHe glanced at his chubby white hand, fingering the stem of his glass. \"I\nhave put on flesh since then,\" he said. [_Pause_].\n\n\"I have changed and developed very much. The battle of the Flesh and\nSpirit does not trouble me as it did. Every day I feel less confidence\nin my beliefs, and more in God. I live, I am afraid, a quiescent life,\nduties fairly done, a little ornithology and a little chess, a trifle of\nmathematical trifling. My times are in His hands----\"\n\nThe Vicar sighed and became pensive. The Angel watched him, and the\nAngel's eyes were troubled with the puzzle of him. \"Gluck, gluck,\ngluck,\" went the decanter as the Vicar refilled his glass.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\nSo the Angel dined and talked to the Vicar, and presently the night came\nand he was overtaken by yawning.\n\n\"Yah----oh!\" said the Angel suddenly. \"Dear me! A higher power seemed\nsuddenly to stretch my mouth open and a great breath of air went rushing\ndown my throat.\"\n\n\"You yawned,\" said the Vicar. \"Do you never yawn in the angelic\ncountry?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"And yet you are immortal!----I suppose you want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"Bed!\" said the Angel. \"Where's that?\"\n\nSo the Vicar explained darkness to him and the art of going to bed. (The\nAngels, it seems sleep only in order to dream, and dream, like primitive\nman, with their foreheads on their knees. And they sleep among the white\npoppy meadows in the heat of the day.) The Angel found the bedroom\narrangements quaint enough.\n\n\"Why is everything raised up on big wooden legs?\" he said. \"You have the\nfloor, and then you put everything you have upon a wooden quadruped. Why\ndo you do it?\" The Vicar explained with philosophical vagueness. The\nAngel burnt his finger in the candle-flame--and displayed an absolute\nignorance of the elementary principles of combustion. He was merely\ncharmed when a line of fire ran up the curtains. The Vicar had to\ndeliver a lecture on fire so soon as the flame was extinguished. He had\nall kinds of explanations to make--even the soap needed explaining. It\nwas an hour or more before the Angel was safely tucked in for the night.\n\n\"He's very beautiful,\" said the Vicar, descending the staircase, quite\ntired out; \"and he's a real angel no doubt. But I am afraid he will be a\ndreadful anxiety, all the same, before he gets into our earthly way with\nthings.\"\n\nHe seemed quite worried. He helped himself to an extra glass of sherry\nbefore he put away the wine in the cellaret.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\nThe Curate stood in front of the looking-glass and solemnly divested\nhimself of his collar.\n\n\"I never heard a more fantastic story,\" said Mrs Mendham from the basket\nchair. \"The man must be mad. Are you sure----.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, my dear. I've told you every word, every incident----.\"\n\n\"_Well!_\" said Mrs Mendham, and spread her hands. \"There's no sense in\nit.\"\n\n\"Precisely, my dear.\"\n\n\"The Vicar,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"must be mad.\"\n\n\"This hunchback is certainly one of the strangest creatures I've seen\nfor a long time. Foreign looking, with a big bright coloured face and\nlong brown hair.... It can't have been cut for months!\" The Curate put\nhis studs carefully upon the shelf of the dressing-table. \"And a kind of\nstaring look about his eyes, and a simpering smile. Quite a silly\nlooking person. Effeminate.\"\n\n\"But who _can_ he be?\" said Mrs Mendham.\n\n\"I can't imagine, my dear. Nor where he came from. He might be a\nchorister or something of that sort.\"\n\n\"But _why_ should he be about the shrubbery ... in that dreadful\ncostume?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The Vicar gave me no explanation. He simply said,\n'Mendham, this is an Angel.'\"\n\n\"I wonder if he drinks.... They may have been bathing near the spring,\nof course,\" reflected Mrs Mendham. \"But I noticed no other clothes on\nhis arm.\"\n\nThe Curate sat down on his bed and unlaced his boots.\n\n\"It's a perfect mystery to me, my dear.\" (Flick, flick of laces.)\n\"Hallucination is the only charitable----\"\n\n\"You are sure, George, that it was _not_ a woman.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said the Curate.\n\n\"I know what men are, of course.\"\n\n\"It was a young man of nineteen or twenty,\" said the Curate.\n\n\"I can't understand it,\" said Mrs Mendham. \"You say the creature is\nstaying at the Vicarage?\"\n\n\"Hilyer is simply mad,\" said the Curate. He got up and went padding\nround the room to the door to put out his boots. \"To judge by his manner\nyou would really think he believed this cripple was an Angel.\" (\"Are\nyour shoes out, dear?\")\n\n(\"They're just by the wardrobe\"), said Mrs Mendham. \"He always was a\nlittle queer, you know. There was always something childish about\nhim.... An Angel!\"\n\nThe Curate came and stood by the fire, fumbling with his braces. Mrs\nMendham liked a fire even in the summer. \"He shirks all the serious\nproblems in life and is always trifling with some new foolishness,\" said\nthe Curate. \"Angel indeed!\" He laughed suddenly. \"Hilyer _must_ be mad,\"\nhe said.\n\nMrs Mendham laughed too. \"Even that doesn't explain the hunchback,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"The hunchback must be mad too,\" said the Curate.\n\n\"It's the only way of explaining it in a sensible way,\" said Mrs\nMendham. [_Pause._]\n\n\"Angel or no angel,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"I know what is due to me. Even\nsupposing the man thought he _was_ in the company of an angel, that is\nno reason why he should not behave like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly true.\"\n\n\"You will write to the Bishop, of course?\"\n\nMendham coughed. \"No, I shan't write to the Bishop,\" said Mendham. \"I\nthink it seems a little disloyal.... And he took no notice of the last,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"But surely----\"\n\n\"I shall write to Austin. In confidence. He will be sure to tell the\nBishop, you know. And you must remember, my dear----\"\n\n\"That Hilyer can dismiss you, you were going to say. My dear, the man's\nmuch too weak! _I_ should have a word to say about that. And besides,\nyou do all his work for him. Practically, we manage the parish from end\nto end. I do not know what would become of the poor if it was not for\nme. They'd have free quarters in the Vicarage to-morrow. There is that\nGoody Ansell----\"\n\n\"I know, my dear,\" said the Curate, turning away and proceeding with his\nundressing. \"You were telling me about her only this afternoon.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\nAnd thus in the little bedroom over the gable we reach a first resting\nplace in this story. And as we have been hard at it, getting our story\nspread out before you, it may be perhaps well to recapitulate a little.\n\nLooking back you will see that much has been done; we began with a blaze\nof light \"not uniform but broken all over by curving flashes like the\nwaving of swords,\" and the sound of a mighty harping, and the advent of\nan Angel with polychromatic wings.\n\nSwiftly, dexterously, as the reader must admit, wings have been clipped,\nhalo handled off, the glory clapped into coat and trousers, and the\nAngel made for all practical purposes a man, under a suspicion of being\neither a lunatic or an impostor. You have heard too, or at least been\nable to judge, what the Vicar and the Doctor and the Curate's wife\nthought of the strange arrival. And further remarkable opinions are to\nfollow.\n\nThe afterglow of the summer sunset in the north-west darkens into night\nand the Angel sleeps, dreaming himself back in the wonderful world where\nit is always light, and everyone is happy, where fire does not burn and\nice does not chill; where rivulets of starlight go streaming through the\namaranthine meadows, out to the seas of Peace. He dreams, and it seems\nto him that once more his wings glow with a thousand colours and flash\nthrough the crystal air of the world from which he has come.\n\nSo he dreams. But the Vicar lies awake, too perplexed for dreaming.\nChiefly he is troubled by the possibilities of Mrs Mendham; but the\nevening's talk has opened strange vistas in his mind, and he is\nstimulated by a sense as of something seen darkly by the indistinct\nvision of a hitherto unsuspected wonderland lying about his world. For\ntwenty years now he has held his village living and lived his daily\nlife, protected by his familiar creed, by the clamour of the details of\nlife, from any mystical dreaming. But now interweaving with the\nfamiliar bother of his persecuting neighbour, is an altogether\nunfamiliar sense of strange new things.\n\nThere was something ominous in the feeling. Once, indeed, it rose above\nall other considerations, and in a kind of terror he blundered out of\nbed, bruised his shins very convincingly, found the matches at last, and\nlit a candle to assure himself of the reality of his own customary world\nagain. But on the whole the more tangible trouble was the Mendham\navalanche. Her tongue seemed to be hanging above him like the sword of\nDamocles. What might she not say of this business, before her indignant\nimagination came to rest?\n\nAnd while the successful captor of the Strange Bird was sleeping thus\nuneasily, Gully of Sidderton was carefully unloading his gun after a\nwearisome blank day, and Sandy Bright was on his knees in prayer, with\nthe window carefully fastened. Annie Durgan was sleeping hard with her\nmouth open, and Amory's mother was dreaming of washing, and both of them\nhad long since exhausted the topics of the Sound and the Glare. Lumpy\nDurgan was sitting up in his bed, now crooning the fragment of a tune\nand now listening intently for a sound he had heard once and longed to\nhear again. As for the solicitor's clerk at Iping Hanger, he was trying\nto write poetry about a confectioner's girl at Portburdock, and the\nStrange Bird was quite out of his head. But the ploughman who had seen\nit on the confines of Siddermorton Park had a black eye. That had been\none of the more tangible consequences of a little argument about birds'\nlegs in the \"Ship.\" It is worthy of this passing mention, since it is\nprobably the only known instance of an Angel causing anything of the\nkind.\n\n\n\n\nMORNING.\n\nXXII.\n\n\nThe Vicar going to call the Angel, found him dressed and leaning out of\nhis window. It was a glorious morning, still dewy, and the rising\nsunlight slanting round the corner of the house, struck warm and yellow\nupon the hillside. The birds were astir in the hedges and shrubbery. Up\nthe hillside--for it was late in August--a plough drove slowly. The\nAngel's chin rested upon his hands and he did not turn as the Vicar came\nup to him.\n\n\"How's the wing?\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"I'd forgotten it,\" said the Angel. \"Is that yonder a man?\"\n\nThe Vicar looked. \"That's a ploughman.\"\n\n\"Why does he go to and fro like that? Does it amuse him?\"\n\n\"He's ploughing. That's his work.\"\n\n\"Work! Why does he do it? It seems a monotonous thing to do.\"\n\n\"It is,\" admitted the Vicar. \"But he has to do it to get a living, you\nknow. To get food to eat and all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"How curious!\" said the Angel. \"Do all men have to do that? Do you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. He does it for me; does my share.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Angel.\n\n\"Oh! in return for things I do for him, you know. We go in for division\nof labour in this world. Exchange is no robbery.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said the Angel, with his eyes still on the ploughman's heavy\nmovements.\n\n\"What do you do for him?\"\n\n\"That seems an easy question to you,\" said the Vicar, \"but really!--it's\ndifficult. Our social arrangements are rather complicated. It's\nimpossible to explain these things all at once, before breakfast. Don't\nyou feel hungry?\"\n\n\"I think I do,\" said the Angel slowly, still at the window; and then\nabruptly, \"Somehow I can't help thinking that ploughing must be far from\nenjoyable.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said the Vicar, \"very possibly. But breakfast is ready.\nWon't you come down?\"\n\nThe Angel left the window reluctantly.\n\n\"Our society,\" explained the Vicar on the staircase, \"is a complicated\norganisation.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"And it is so arranged that some do one thing and some another.\"\n\n\"And that lean, bent old man trudges after that heavy blade of iron\npulled by a couple of horses while we go down to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes. You will find it is perfectly just. Ah! mushrooms and poached\neggs! It's the Social System. Pray be seated. Possibly it strikes you as\nunfair?\"\n\n\"I'm puzzled,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"The drink I'm sending you is called coffee,\" said the Vicar. \"I daresay\nyou are. When I was a young man I was puzzled in the same way. But\nafterwards comes a Broader View of Things. (These black things are\ncalled mushrooms; they look beautiful.) Other Considerations. All men\nare brothers, of course, but some are younger brothers, so to speak.\nThere is work that requires culture and refinement, and work in which\nculture and refinement would be an impediment. And the rights of\nproperty must not be forgotten. One must render unto C\u00c3\u00a6sar.... Do you\nknow, instead of explaining this matter now (this is yours), I think I\nwill lend you a little book to read (_chum_, _chum_, _chum_--these\nmushrooms are well up to their appearance), which sets the whole thing\nout very clearly.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE VIOLIN.\n\nXXIII.\n\n\nAfter breakfast the Vicar went into the little room next his study to\nfind a book on Political Economy for the Angel to read. For the Angel's\nsocial ignorances were clearly beyond any verbal explanations. The door\nstood ajar.\n\n\"What is that?\" said the Angel, following him. \"A violin!\" He took it\ndown.\n\n\"You play?\" said the Vicar.\n\nThe Angel had the bow in his hand, and by way of answer drove it across\nthe strings. The quality of the note made the Vicar turn suddenly.\n\nThe Angel's hand tightened on the instrument. The bow flew back and\nflickered, and an air the Vicar had never heard before danced in his\nears. The Angel shifted the fiddle under his dainty chin and went on\nplaying, and as he played his eyes grew bright and his lips smiled. At\nfirst he looked at the Vicar, then his expression became abstracted. He\nseemed no longer to look at the Vicar, but through him, at something\nbeyond, something in his memory or his imagination, something infinitely\nremote, undreamt of hitherto....\n\nThe Vicar tried to follow the music. The air reminded him of a flame, it\nrushed up, shone, flickered and danced, passed and reappeared. No!--it\ndid not reappear! Another air--like it and unlike it, shot up after it,\nwavered, vanished. Then another, the same and not the same. It reminded\nhim of the flaring tongues that palpitate and change above a newly lit\nfire. There are two airs--or _motifs_, which is it?--thought the Vicar.\nHe knew remarkably little of musical technique. They go dancing up, one\npursuing the other, out of the fire of the incantation, pursuing,\nfluctuating, turning, up into the sky. There below was the fire burning,\na flame without fuel upon a level space, and there two flirting\nbutterflies of sound, dancing away from it, up, one over another, swift,\nabrupt, uncertain.\n\n\"Flirting butterflies were they!\" What was the Vicar thinking of? Where\nwas he? In the little room next to his study, of course! And the Angel\nstanding in front of him smiling into his face, playing the violin, and\nlooking through him as though he was only a window----. That _motif_\nagain, a yellow flare, spread fanlike by a gust, and now one, then with\na swift eddying upward flight the other, the two things of fire and\nlight pursuing one another again up into that clear immensity.\n\nThe study and the realities of life suddenly faded out of the Vicar's\neyes, grew thinner and thinner like a mist that dissolves into air, and\nhe and the Angel stood together on a pinnacle of wrought music, about\nwhich glittering melodies circled, and vanished, and reappeared. He was\nin the land of Beauty, and once more the glory of heaven was upon the\nAngel's face, and the glowing delights of colour pulsated in his wings.\nHimself the Vicar could not see. But I cannot tell you of the vision of\nthat great and spacious land, of its incredible openness, and height,\nand nobility. For there is no space there like ours, no time as we know\nit; one must needs speak by bungling metaphors and own in bitterness\nafter all that one has failed. And it was only a vision. The wonderful\ncreatures flying through the \u00c3\u00a6ther saw them not as they stood there,\nflew through them as one might pass through a whisp of mist. The Vicar\nlost all sense of duration, all sense of necessity----\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Angel, suddenly putting down the fiddle.\n\nThe Vicar had forgotten the book on Political Economy, had forgotten\neverything until the Angel had done. For a minute he sat quite still.\nThen he woke up with a start. He was sitting on the old iron-bound\nchest.\n\n\"Really,\" he said slowly, \"you are very clever.\"\n\nHe looked about him in a puzzled way. \"I had a kind of vision while you\nwere playing. I seemed to see----. What did I see? It has gone.\"\n\nHe stood up with a dazzled expression upon his face. \"I shall never play\nthe violin again,\" he said. \"I wish you would take it to your room--and\nkeep it----. And play to me again. I did not know anything of music\nuntil I heard you play. I do not feel as though I had ever heard any\nmusic before.\"\n\nHe stared at the Angel, then about him at the room. \"I have never felt\nanything of this kind with music before,\" he said. He shook his head. \"I\nshall never play again.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANGEL EXPLORES THE VILLAGE.\n\nXXIV.\n\n\nVery unwisely, as I think, the Vicar allowed the Angel to go down into\nthe village by himself, to enlarge his ideas of humanity. Unwisely,\nbecause how was he to imagine the reception the Angel would receive? Not\nthoughtlessly, I am afraid. He had always carried himself with decorum\nin the village, and the idea of a slow procession through the little\nstreet with all the inevitable curious remarks, explanations, pointings,\nwas too much for him. The Angel might do the strangest things, the\nvillage was certain to think them. Peering faces. \"Who's _he_ got now?\"\nBesides, was it not his duty to prepare his sermon in good time? The\nAngel, duly directed, went down cheerfully by himself--still innocent of\nmost of the peculiarities of the human as distinguished from the angelic\nturn of mind.\n\nThe Angel walked slowly, his white hands folded behind his hunched\nback, his sweet face looking this way and that. He peered curiously into\nthe eyes of the people he met. A little child picking a bunch of vetch\nand honeysuckle looked in his face, and forthwith came and put them in\nhis hand. It was about the only kindness he had from a human being\n(saving only the Vicar and one other). He heard Mother Gustick scolding\nthat granddaughter of hers as he passed the door. \"You _Brazen_\nFaggit--you!\" said Mother Gustick. \"You Trumpery Baggage!\"\n\nThe Angel stopped, startled at the strange sounds of Mother Gustick's\nvoice. \"Put yer best clo'es on, and yer feather in yer 'at, and off you\ngoes to meet en, fal lal, and me at 'ome slaving for ye. 'Tis a Fancy\nLady you'll be wantin' to be, my gal, a walkin' Touch and Go, with yer\nidleness and finery----\"\n\nThe voice ceased abruptly, and a great peace came upon the battered air.\n\"Most grotesque and strange!\" said the Angel, still surveying this\nwonderful box of discords. \"Walking Touch and Go!\" He did not know that\nMrs Gustick had suddenly become aware of his existence, and was\nscrutinizing his appearance through the window-blind. Abruptly the door\nflew open, and she stared out into the Angel's face. A strange\napparition, grey and dusty hair, and the dirty pink dress unhooked to\nshow the stringy throat, a discoloured gargoyle, presently to begin\nspouting incomprehensible abuse.\n\n\"Now, then, Mister,\" began Mrs Gustick. \"Have ye nothin' better to do\nthan listen at people's doors for what you can pick up?\"\n\nThe Angel stared at her in astonishment.\n\n\"D'year!\" said Mrs Gustick, evidently very angry indeed. \"Listenin'.\"\n\n\"Have you any objection to my hearing....\"\n\n\"Object to my hearing! Course I have! Whad yer think? You aint such a\nNinny....\"\n\n\"But if ye didn't want me to hear, why did you cry out so loud? I\nthought....\"\n\n\"_You thought!_ Softie--that's what _you_ are! You silly girt staring\nGaby, what don't know any better than to come holding yer girt mouth\nwide open for all that you can catch holt on? And then off up there to\ntell! You great Fat-Faced, Tale-Bearin' Silly-Billy! I'd be ashamed to\ncome poking and peering round quiet people's houses....\"\n\nThe Angel was surprised to find that some inexplicable quality in her\nvoice excited the most disagreeable sensations in him and a strong\ndesire to withdraw. But, resisting this, he stood listening politely (as\nthe custom is in the Angelic Land, so long as anyone is speaking). The\nentire eruption was beyond his comprehension. He could not perceive any\nreason for the sudden projection of this vituperative head, out of\ninfinity, so to speak. And questions without a break for an answer were\noutside his experience altogether.\n\nMrs Gustick proceeded with her characteristic fluency, assured him he\nwas no gentleman, enquired if he called himself one, remarked that every\ntramp did as much nowadays, compared him to a Stuck Pig, marvelled at\nhis impudence, asked him if he wasn't ashamed of himself standing there,\nenquired if he was rooted to the ground, was curious to be told what he\nmeant by it, wanted to know whether he robbed a scarecrow for his\nclothes, suggested that an abnormal vanity prompted his behaviour,\nenquired if his mother knew he was out, and finally remarking, \"I got\nsomethin'll move you, my gentleman,\" disappeared with a ferocious\nslamming of the door.\n\nThe interval struck the Angel as singularly peaceful. His whirling mind\nhad time to analyse his sensations. He ceased bowing and smiling, and\nstood merely astonished.\n\n\"This is a curious painful feeling,\" said the Angel. \"Almost worse than\nHungry, and quite different. When one is hungry one wants to eat. I\nsuppose she was a woman. Here one wants to get away. I suppose I might\njust as well go.\"\n\nHe turned slowly and went down the road meditating. He heard the cottage\ndoor re-open, and turning his head, saw through intervening scarlet\nrunners Mrs Gustick with a steaming saucepan full of boiling cabbage\nwater in her hand.\n\n\"'Tis well you went, Mister Stolen Breeches,\" came the voice of Mrs\nGustick floating down through the vermilion blossoms. \"Don't you come\npeeping and prying round this yer cottage again or I'll learn ye\nmanners, I will!\"\n\nThe Angel stood in a state of considerable perplexity. He had no desire\nto come within earshot of the cottage again--ever. He did not understand\nthe precise import of the black pot, but his general impression was\nentirely disagreeable. There was no explaining it.\n\n\"I _mean_ it!\" said Mrs Gustick, crescendo. \"Drat it!--I _mean_ it.\"\n\nThe Angel turned and went on, a dazzled look in his eyes.\n\n\"She was very grotesque!\" said the Angel. \"_Very._ Much more than the\nlittle man in black. And she means it.---- But what she means I don't\nknow!...\" He became silent. \"I suppose they all mean something,\", he\nsaid, presently, still perplexed.\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\n\nThen the Angel came in sight of the forge, where Sandy Bright's brother\nwas shoeing a horse for the carter from Upmorton. Two hobbledehoys were\nstanding by the forge staring in a bovine way at the proceedings. As the\nAngel approached these two and then the carter turned slowly through an\nangle of thirty degrees and watched his approach, staring quietly and\nsteadily at him. The expression on their faces was one of abstract\ninterest.\n\nThe Angel became self-conscious for the first time in his life. He drew\nnearer, trying to maintain an amiable expression on his face, an\nexpression that beat in vain against their granitic stare. His hands\nwere behind him. He smiled pleasantly, looking curiously at the (to him)\nincomprehensible employment of the smith. But the battery of eyes seemed\nto angle for his regard. Trying to meet the three pairs at once, the\nAngel lost his alertness and stumbled over a stone. One of the yokels\ngave a sarcastic cough, and was immediately covered with confusion at\nthe Angel's enquiring gaze, nudging his companion with his elbow to\ncover his disorder. None spoke, and the Angel did not speak.\n\nSo soon as the Angel had passed, one of the three hummed this tune in an\naggressive tone.\n\n[Illustration: Music]\n\nThen all three of them laughed. One tried to sing something and found\nhis throat contained phlegm. The Angel proceeded on his way.\n\n\"Who's _e_ then?\" said the second hobbledehoy.\n\n\"Ping, ping, ping,\" went the blacksmith's hammer.\n\n\"Spose he's one of these here foweners,\" said the carter from Upmorton.\n\"D\u00c3\u00a4amned silly fool he do look to be sure.\"\n\n\"Tas the way with them foweners,\" said the first hobbledehoy sagely.\n\n\"Got something very like the 'ump,\" said the carter from Upmorton.\n\"D\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4-\u00c3\u00a4-\u00c3\u00a4mned if 'E ent.\"\n\nThen the silence healed again, and they resumed their quiet\nexpressionless consideration of the Angel's retreating figure.\n\n\"Very like the 'ump et is,\" said the carter after an enormous pause.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI.\n\n\nThe Angel went on through the village, finding it all wonderful enough.\n\"They begin, and just a little while and then they end,\" he said to\nhimself in a puzzled voice. \"But what are they doing meanwhile?\" Once he\nheard some invisible mouth chant inaudible words to the tune the man at\nthe forge had hummed.\n\n\"That's the poor creature the Vicar shot with that great gun of his,\"\nsaid Sarah Glue (of 1, Church Cottages) peering over the blind.\n\n\"He looks Frenchified,\" said Susan Hopper, peering through the\ninterstices of that convenient veil on curiosity.\n\n\"He has sweet eyes,\" said Sarah Glue, who had met them for a moment.\n\nThe Angel sauntered on. The postman passed him and touched his hat to\nhim; further down was a dog asleep in the sun. He went on and saw\nMendham, who nodded distantly and hurried past. (The Curate did not\ncare to be seen talking to an angel in the village, until more was known\nabout him). There came from one of the houses the sound of a child\nscreaming in a passion, that brought a puzzled look to the angelic face.\nThen the Angel reached the bridge below the last of the houses, and\nstood leaning over the parapet watching the glittering little cascade\nfrom the mill.\n\n\"They begin, and just a little while, and then they end,\" said the weir\nfrom the mill. The water raced under the bridge, green and dark, and\nstreaked with foam.\n\nBeyond the mill rose the square tower of the church, with the churchyard\nbehind it, a spray of tombstones and wooden headboards splashed up the\nhillside. A half dozen of beech trees framed the picture.\n\nThen the Angel heard a shuffling of feet and the gride of wheels behind\nhim, and turning his head saw a man dressed in dirty brown rags and a\nfelt hat grey with dust, who was standing with a slight swaying motion\nand fixedly regarding the Angelic back. Beyond him was another almost\nequally dirty, pushing a knife grinder's barrow over the bridge.\n\n\"Mornin',\" said the first person smiling weakly. \"Goomorn'.\" He arrested\nan escaping hiccough.\n\nThe Angel stared at him. He had never seen a really fatuous smile\nbefore. \"Who are you?\" said the Angel.\n\nThe fatuous smile faded. \"No your business whoaaam. Wishergoomorn.\"\n\n\"Carm on:\" said the man with the grindstone, passing on his way.\n\n\"Wishergoomorn,\" said the dirty man, in a tone of extreme aggravation.\n\"Carncher Answerme?\"\n\n\"Carm _on_ you fool!\" said the man with the grindstone--receding.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Donunderstan'. Sim'l enough. Wishergoomorn'. Willyanswerme? Wontchr?\ngemwishergem goomorn. Cusom answer goomorn. No gem. Haverteachyer.\"\n\nThe Angel was puzzled. The drunken man stood swaying for a moment, then\nhe made an unsteady snatch at his hat and threw it down at the Angel's\nfeet. \"Ver well,\" he said, as one who decides great issues.\n\n\"_Carm_ on!\" said the voice of the man with the grindstone--stopping\nperhaps twenty yards off.\n\n\"You _wan_ fight, you ----\" the Angel failed to catch the word. \"I'll\nshow yer, not answer gem's goomorn.\"\n\nHe began to struggle with his jacket. \"Think I'm drun,\" he said, \"I show\nyer.\" The man with the grindstone sat down on the shaft to watch. \"Carm\non,\" he said. The jacket was intricate, and the drunken man began to\nstruggle about the road, in his attempts to extricate himself, breathing\nthreatenings and slaughter. Slowly the Angel began to suspect, remotely\nenough, that these demonstrations were hostile. \"Mur wun know yer when I\ndone wi' yer,\" said the drunken man, coat almost over his head.\n\nAt last the garment lay on the ground, and through the frequent\ninterstices of his reminiscences of a waistcoat, the drunken tinker\ndisplayed a fine hairy and muscular body to the Angel's observant eyes.\nHe squared up in masterly fashion.\n\n\"Take the paint off yer,\" he remarked, advancing and receding, fists up\nand elbows out.\n\n\"Carm on,\" floated down the road.\n\nThe Angel's attention was concentrated on two huge hairy black fists,\nthat swayed and advanced and retreated. \"Come on d'yer say? I'll show\nyer,\" said the gentleman in rags, and then with extraordinary ferocity;\n\"My crikey! I'll show yer.\"\n\nSuddenly he lurched forward, and with a newborn instinct and raising a\ndefensive arm as he did so, the Angel stepped aside to avoid him. The\nfist missed the Angelic shoulder by a hairsbreadth, and the tinker\ncollapsed in a heap with his face against the parapet of the bridge. The\nAngel hesitated over the writhing dusty heap of blasphemy for a moment,\nand then turned towards the man's companion up the road. \"Lemmeget up,\"\nsaid the man on the bridge: \"Lemmeget up, you swine. I'll show yer.\"\n\nA strange disgust, a quivering repulsion came upon the Angel. He walked\nslowly away from the drunkard towards the man with the grindstone.\n\n\"What does it all mean?\" said the Angel. \"I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"Dam fool!... say's it's 'is silver weddin',\" answered the man with the\ngrindstone, evidently much annoyed; and then, in a tone of growing\nimpatience, he called down the road once more; \"Carm on!\"\n\n\"Silver wedding!\" said the Angel. \"What is a silver wedding?\"\n\n\"Jest is rot,\" said the man on the barrow. \"But 'E's always avin' some\n'scuse like that. Fair sickenin it is. Lars week it wus 'is bloomin'\nbirthday, and _then_ 'e ad'nt ardly got sober orf a comlimentary drunk\nto my noo barrer. (_Carm_ on, you fool.)\"\n\n\"But I don't understand,\" said the Angel. \"Why does he sway about so?\nWhy does he keep on trying to pick up his hat like that--and missing\nit?\"\n\n\"_Why!_\" said the tinker. \"Well this _is_ a blasted innocent country!\n_Why!_ Because 'E's blind! Wot else? (Carm on--_Dam_ yer). Because 'E's\njust as full as 'E can 'old. That's _why_!\"\n\nThe Angel noticing the tone of the second tinker's voice, judged it\nwiser not to question him further. But he stood by the grindstone and\ncontinued to watch the mysterious evolutions on the bridge.\n\n\"Carm on! I shall 'ave to go and pick up that 'at I suppose.... 'E's\nalways at it. I ne'er 'ad such a blooming pard before. _Always_ at it,\n'e is.\"\n\nThe man with the barrow meditated. \"Taint as if 'e was a gentleman and\n'adnt no livin' to get. An' 'e's such a reckless fool when 'e gets a bit\non. Goes offerin out everyone 'e meets. (_There_ you go!) I'm blessed if\n'e didn't offer out a 'ole bloomin' Salvation Army. No judgment in it.\n(Oh! _Carm_ on! _Carm_ on!). 'Ave to go and pick this bloomin' 'at up\nnow I s'pose. 'E don't care, _wot_ trouble 'e gives.\"\n\nThe Angel watched the second tinker walk back, and, with affectionate\nblasphemy, assist the first to his hat and his coat. Then he turned,\nabsolutely mystified, towards the village again.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII.\n\n\nAfter that incident the Angel walked along past the mill and round\nbehind the church, to examine the tombstones.\n\n\"This seems to be the place where they put the broken pieces,\" said the\nAngel--reading the inscriptions. \"Curious word--relict! Resurgam! Then\nthey are not done with quite. What a huge pile it requires to keep her\ndown.... It is spirited of her.\"\n\n\"Hawkins?\" said the Angel softly,.... \"_Hawkins?_ The name is strange to\nme.... He did not die then.... It is plain enough,--Joined the Angelic\nHosts, May 17, 1863. He must have felt as much out of place as I do down\nhere. But I wonder why they put that little pot thing on the top of this\nmonument. Curious! There are several others about--little stone pots\nwith a rag of stiff stone drapery over them.\"\n\nJust then the boys came pouring out of the National School, and first\none and then several stopped agape at the Angel's crooked black figure\namong the white tombs. \"Ent 'e gart a b\u00c3\u00a4\u00c3\u00a4k on en!\" remarked one critic.\n\n\"'E's got 'air like a girl!\" said another.\n\nThe Angel turned towards them. He was struck by the queer little heads\nsticking up over the lichenous wall. He smiled faintly at their staring\nfaces, and then turned to marvel at the iron railings that enclosed the\nFitz-Jarvis tomb. \"A queer air of uncertainty,\" he said. \"Slabs, piles\nof stone, these railings.... Are they afraid?... Do these Dead ever try\nand get up again? There's an air of repression--fortification----\"\n\n\"G\u00c3\u00a9t yer _'air_ cut, G\u00c3\u00a9t yer _'air_ cut,\" sang three little boys\ntogether.\n\n\"Curious these Human Beings are!\" said the Angel. \"That man yesterday\nwanted to cut off my wings, now these little creatures want me to cut\noff my hair! And the man on the bridge offered to take the 'paint' off\nme. They will leave nothing of me soon.\"\n\n\"Where did you get that _'at_?\" sang another little boy. \"Where did you\nget them clo'es?\"\n\n\"They ask questions that they evidently do not want answered,\" said the\nAngel. \"I can tell from the tone.\" He looked thoughtfully at the little\nboys. \"I don't understand the methods of Human intercourse. These are\nprobably friendly advances, a kind of ritual. But I don't know the\nresponses. I think I will go back to the little fat man in black, with\nthe gold chain across his stomach, and ask him to explain. It is\ndifficult.\"\n\nHe turned towards the lych gate. \"_Oh!_\" said one of the little boys, in\na shrill falsetto, and threw a beech-nut husk. It came bounding across\nthe churchyard path. The Angel stopped in surprise.\n\nThis made all the little boys laugh. A second imitating the first, said\n\"_Oh!_\" and hit the Angel. His astonishment was really delicious. They\nall began crying \"_Oh!_\" and throwing beechnut husks. One hit the\nAngel's hand, another stung him smartly by the ear. The Angel made\nungainly movements towards them. He spluttered some expostulation and\nmade for the roadway. The little boys were amazed and shocked at his\ndiscomfiture and cowardice. Such sawney behaviour could not be\nencouraged. The pelting grew vigorously. You may perhaps be able to\nimagine those vivid moments, daring small boys running in close and\ndelivering shots, milder small boys rushing round behind with flying\ndischarges. Milton Screever's mongrel dog was roused to yelping ecstacy\nat the sight, and danced (full of wild imaginings) nearer and nearer to\nthe angelic legs.\n\n\"Hi, hi!\" said a vigorous voice. \"I never did! Where's Mr Jarvis?\nManners, manners! you young rascals.\"\n\nThe youngsters scattered right and left, some over the wall into the\nplayground, some down the street.\n\n\"Frightful pest these boys are getting!\" said Crump, coming up. \"I'm\nsorry they have been annoying you.\"\n\nThe Angel seemed quite upset. \"I don't understand,\" he said. \"These\nHuman ways....\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. Unusual to you. How's your excrescence?\"\n\n\"My what?\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Bifid limb, you know. How is it? Now you're down this way, come in.\nCome in and let me have a look at it again. You young roughs! And\nmeanwhile these little louts of ours will be getting off home. They're\nall alike in these villages. _Can't_ understand anything abnormal. See\nan odd-looking stranger. Chuck a stone. No imagination beyond the\nparish.... (I'll give you physic if I catch you annoying strangers\nagain.) ... I suppose it's what one might expect.... Come along this\nway.\"\n\nSo the Angel, horribly perplexed still, was hurried into the surgery to\nhave his wound re-dressed.\n\n\n\n\nLADY HAMMERGALLOW'S VIEW.\n\nXXVIII.\n\n\nIn Siddermorton Park is Siddermorton House, where old Lady Hammergallow\nlives, chiefly upon Burgundy and the little scandals of the village, a\ndear old lady with a ropy neck, a ruddled countenance and spasmodic\ngusts of odd temper, whose three remedies for all human trouble among\nher dependents are, a bottle of gin, a pair of charity blankets, or a\nnew crown piece. The House is a mile-and-a-half out of Siddermorton.\nAlmost all the village is hers, saving a fringe to the south which\nbelongs to Sir John Gotch, and she rules it with an autocratic rule,\nrefreshing in these days of divided government. She orders and forbids\nmarriages, drives objectionable people out of the village by the simple\nexpedient of raising their rent, dismisses labourers, obliges heretics\nto go to church, and made Susan Dangett, who wanted to call her little\ngirl 'Euphemia,' have the infant christened 'Mary-Anne.' She is a sturdy\nBroad Protestant and disapproves of the Vicar's going bald like a\ntonsure. She is on the Village Council, which obsequiously trudges up\nthe hill and over the moor to her, and (as she is a trifle deaf) speaks\nall its speeches into her speaking trumpet instead of a rostrum. She\ntakes no interest now in politics, but until last year she was an active\nenemy of \"that Gladstone.\" She has parlour maids instead of footmen to\ndo her waiting, because of Hockley, the American stockbroker, and his\nfour Titans in plush.\n\nShe exercises what is almost a fascination upon the village. If in the\nbar-parlour of the Cat and Cornucopia you swear by God no one would be\nshocked, but if you swore by Lady Hammergallow they would probably be\nshocked enough to turn you out of the room. When she drives through\nSiddermorton she always calls upon Bessy Flump, the post-mistress, to\nhear all that has happened, and then upon Miss Finch, the dressmaker, to\ncheck back Bessy Flump. Sometimes she calls upon the Vicar, sometimes\nupon Mrs Mendham whom she snubs, and even sometimes on Crump. Her\nsparkling pair of greys almost ran over the Angel as he was walking down\nto the village.\n\n\"So _that's_ the genius!\" said Lady Hammergallow, and turned and looked\nat him through the gilt glasses on a stick that she always carried in\nher shrivelled and shaky hand. \"Lunatic indeed! The poor creature has\nrather a pretty face. I'm sorry I've missed him.\"\n\nBut she went on to the vicarage nevertheless, and demanded news of it\nall. The conflicting accounts of Miss Flump, Miss Finch, Mrs Mendham,\nCrump, and Mrs Jehoram had puzzled her immensely. The Vicar, hard\npressed, did all he could to say into her speaking trumpet what had\nreally happened. He toned down the wings and the saffron robe. But he\nfelt the case was hopeless. He spoke of his prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 as \"Mr\" Angel. He\naddressed pathetic asides to the kingfisher. The old lady noticed his\nconfusion. Her queer old head went jerking backwards and forwards, now\nthe speaking trumpet in his face when he had nothing to say, then the\nshrunken eyes peering at him, oblivious of the explanation that was\ncoming from his lips. A great many Ohs! and Ahs! She caught some\nfragments certainly.\n\n\"You have asked him to stop with you--indefinitely?\" said Lady\nHammergallow with a Great Idea taking shape rapidly in her mind.\n\n\"I did--perhaps inadvertently--make such--\"\n\n\"And you don't know where he comes from?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Nor who his father is, I suppose?\" said Lady Hammergallow mysteriously.\n\n\"No,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"_Now!_\" said Lady Hammergallow archly, and keeping her glasses to her\neye, she suddenly dug at his ribs with her trumpet.\n\n\"My _dear_ Lady Hammergallow!\"\n\n\"I thought so. Don't think _I_ would blame you, Mr Hilyer.\" She gave a\ncorrupt laugh that she delighted in. \"The world is the world, and men\nare men. And the poor boy's a cripple, eh? A kind of judgment. In\nmourning, I noticed. It reminds me of the _Scarlet Letter_. The mother's\ndead, I suppose. It's just as well. Really--I'm not a _narrow_ woman--I\n_respect_ you for having him. Really I do.\"\n\n\"But, _Lady_ Hammergallow!\"\n\n\"Don't spoil everything by denying it. It is so very, very plain, to a\nwoman of the world. That Mrs Mendham! She amuses me with her suspicions.\nSuch odd ideas! In a Curate's wife. But I hope it didn't happen when you\nwere in orders.\"\n\n\"Lady Hammergallow, I protest. Upon my word.\"\n\n\"Mr Hilyer, I protest. I _know_. Not anything you can say will alter my\nopinion one jot. Don't try. I never suspected you were nearly such an\ninteresting man.\"\n\n\"But this suspicion is unendurable!\"\n\n\"We will help him together, Mr Hilyer. You may rely upon me. It is most\nromantic.\" She beamed benevolence.\n\n\"But, Lady Hammergallow, I _must_ speak!\"\n\nShe gripped her ear-trumpet resolutely, and held it before her and shook\nher head.\n\n\"He has quite a genius for music, Vicar, so I hear?\"\n\n\"I can assure you most solemnly--\"\n\n\"I thought so. And being a cripple--\"\n\n\"You are under a most cruel--\"\n\n\"I thought that if his gift is really what that Jehoram woman says.\"\n\n\"An unjustifiable suspicion that ever a man--\"\n\n(\"I don't think much of her judgment, of course.\")\n\n\"Consider my position. Have I gained _no_ character?\"\n\n\"It might be possible to do something for him as a performer.\"\n\n\"Have I--(_Bother! It's no good!_)\"\n\n\"And so, dear Vicar, I propose to give him an opportunity of showing us\nwhat he can do. I have been thinking it all over as I drove here. On\nTuesday next, I will invite just a few people of taste, and he shall\nbring his violin. Eigh? And if that goes well, I will see if I can get\nsome introductions and really _push_ him.\"\n\n\"But _Lady_, Lady Hammergallow.\"\n\n\"Not another word!\" said Lady Hammergallow, still resolutely holding her\nspeaking trumpet before her and clutching her eyeglasses. \"I really\nmust not leave those horses. Cutler is so annoyed if I keep them too\nlong. He finds waiting tedious, poor man, unless there is a public-house\nnear.\" She made for the door.\n\n\"_Damn!_\" said the Vicar, under his breath. He had never used the word\nsince he had taken orders. It shows you how an Angel's visit may\ndisorganize a man.\n\nHe stood under the verandah watching the carriage drive away. The world\nseemed coming to pieces about him. Had he lived a virtuous celibate life\nfor thirty odd years in vain? The things of which these people thought\nhim capable! He stood and stared at the green cornfield opposite, and\ndown at the straggling village. It seemed real enough. And yet for the\nfirst time in his life there was a queer doubt of its reality. He rubbed\nhis chin, then turned and went slowly upstairs to his dressing-room, and\nsat for a long time staring at a garment of some yellow texture. \"Know\nhis father!\" he said. \"And he is immortal, and was fluttering about his\nheaven when my ancestors were marsupials.... I wish he was there now.\"\n\nHe got up and began to feel the robe.\n\n\"I wonder how they get such things,\" said the Vicar. Then he went and\nstared out of the window. \"I suppose everything is wonderful, even the\nrising and setting of the sun. I suppose there is no adamantine ground\nfor any belief. But one gets into a regular way of taking things. This\ndisturbs it. I seem to be waking up to the Invisible. It is the\nstrangest of uncertainties. I have not felt so stirred and unsettled\nsince my adolescence.\"\n\n\n\n\nFURTHER ADVENTURES OF THE ANGEL IN THE VILLAGE.\n\nXXIX.\n\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Crump when the bandaging was replaced. \"It's a\ntrick of memory, no doubt, but these excrescences of yours don't seem\nnearly so large as they did yesterday. I suppose they struck me rather\nforcibly. Stop and have lunch with me now you're down here. Midday meal,\nyou know. The youngsters will be swallowed up by school again in the\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"I never saw anything heal so well in my life,\" he said, as they walked\ninto the dining-room. \"Your blood and flesh must be as clean and free\nfrom bacteria as they make 'em. Whatever stuff there is in your head,\"\nhe added _sotto voce_.\n\nAt lunch he watched the Angel narrowly, and talked to draw him out.\n\n\"Journey tire you yesterday?\" he said suddenly.\n\n\"Journey!\" said the Angel. \"Oh! my wings felt a little stiff.\"\n\n(\"Not to be had,\") said Crump to himself. (\"Suppose I must enter into\nit.\")\n\n\"So you flew all the way, eigh? No conveyance?\"\n\n\"There wasn't any way,\" explained the Angel, taking mustard. \"I was\nflying up a symphony with some Griffins and Fiery Cherubim, and suddenly\neverything went dark and I was in this world of yours.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Crump. \"And that's why you haven't any luggage.\" He drew\nhis serviette across his mouth, and a smile flickered in his eyes.\n\n\"I suppose you know this world of ours pretty well? Watching us over the\nadamantine walls and all that kind of thing. Eigh?\"\n\n\"Not very well. We dream of it sometimes. In the moonlight, when the\nNightmares have fanned us to sleep with their wings.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--of course,\" said Crump. \"Very poetical way of putting it.\nWon't you take some Burgundy? It's just beside you.\"\n\n\"There's a persuasion in this world, you know, that Angels' Visits are\nby no means infrequent. Perhaps some of your--friends have travelled?\nThey are supposed to come down to deserving persons in prisons, and do\nrefined Nautches and that kind of thing. Faust business, you know.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of anything of the kind,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Only the other day a lady whose baby was my patient for the time\nbeing--indigestion--assured me that certain facial contortions the\nlittle creature made indicated that it was Dreaming of Angels. In the\nnovels of Mrs Henry Wood that is spoken of as an infallible symptom of\nan early departure. I suppose you can't throw any light on that obscure\npathological manifestation?\"\n\n\"I don't understand it at all,\" said the Angel, puzzled, and not clearly\napprehending the Doctor's drift.\n\n(\"Getting huffy,\") said Crump to himself. (\"Sees I'm poking fun at\nhim.\") \"There's one thing I'm curious about. Do the new arrivals\ncomplain much about their medical attendants? I've always fancied there\nmust be a good deal of hydropathic talk just at first. I was looking at\nthat picture in the Academy only this June....\"\n\n\"New Arrivals!\" said the Angel. \"I really don't follow you.\"\n\nThe Doctor stared. \"Don't they come?\"\n\n\"Come!\" said the Angel. \"Who?\"\n\n\"The people who die here.\"\n\n\"After they've gone to pieces here?\"\n\n\"That's the general belief, you know.\"\n\n\"People, like the woman who screamed out of the door, and the blackfaced\nman and his volutations and the horrible little things that threw\nhusks!--certainly not. _I_ never saw such creatures before I fell into\nthis world.\"\n\n\"Oh! but come!\" said the Doctor. \"You'll tell me next your official\nrobes are not white and that you can't play the harp.\"\n\n\"There's no such thing as white in the Angelic Land,\" said the Angel.\n\"It's that queer blank colour you get by mixing up all the others.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear Sir!\" said the doctor, suddenly altering his tone, \"you\npositively know nothing about the Land you come from. White's the very\nessence of it.\"\n\nThe Angel stared at him. Was the man jesting? He looked perfectly\nserious.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Crump, and getting up, he went to the sideboard on\nwhich a copy of the Parish Magazine was lying. He brought it round to\nthe Angel and opened it at the coloured supplement. \"Here's some _real_\nangels,\" he said. \"You see it's not simply the wings make the Angel.\nWhite you see, with a curly whisp of robe, sailing up into the sky with\ntheir wings furled. Those are angels on the best authority. Hydroxyl\nkind of hair. One has a bit of a harp, you see, and the other is helping\nthis wingless lady--kind of larval Angel, you know--upward.\"\n\n\"Oh! but really!\" said the Angel, \"those are not angels at all.\"\n\n\"But they _are_,\" said Crump, putting the magazine back on the sideboard\nand resuming his seat with an air of intense satisfaction. \"I can assure\nyou I have the _best_ authority....\"\n\n\"I can assure you....\"\n\nCrump tucked in the corners of his mouth and shook his head from side to\nside even as he had done to the Vicar. \"No good,\" he said, \"can't alter\nour ideas just because an irresponsible visitor....\"\n\n\"If these are angels,\" said the Angel, \"then I have never been in the\nAngelic Land.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Crump, ineffably self-satisfied; \"that was just what I\nwas getting at.\"\n\nThe Angel stared at him for a minute round-eyed, and then was seized for\nthe second time by the human disorder of laughter.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" said Crump, joining in. \"I _thought_ you were not quite so\nmad as you seemed. Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nAnd for the rest of the lunch they were both very merry, for entirely\ndifferent reasons, and Crump insisted upon treating the Angel as a\n\"dorg\" of the highest degree.\n\n\n\n\nXXX.\n\n\nAfter the Angel had left Crump's house he went up the hill again towards\nthe Vicarage. But--possibly moved by the desire to avoid Mrs Gustick--he\nturned aside at the stile and made a detour by the Lark's Field and\nBradley's Farm.\n\nHe came upon the Respectable Tramp slumbering peacefully among the\nwild-flowers. He stopped to look, struck by the celestial tranquillity\nof that individual's face. And even as he did so the Respectable Tramp\nawoke with a start and sat up. He was a pallid creature, dressed in\nrusty black, with a broken-spirited crush hat cocked over one eye. \"Good\nafternoon,\" he said affably. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Very well, thank you,\" said the Angel, who had mastered the phrase.\n\nThe Respectable Tramp eyed the Angel critically. \"Padding the Hoof,\nmatey?\" he said. \"Like me.\"\n\nThe Angel was puzzled by him. \"Why,\" asked the Angel, \"do you sleep\nlike this instead of sleeping up in the air on a Bed?\"\n\n\"Well I'm blowed!\" said the Respectable Tramp. \"Why don't I sleep in a\nbed? Well, it's like this. Sandringham's got the painters in, there's\nthe drains up in Windsor Castle, and I 'aven't no other 'ouse to go to.\nYou 'aven't the price of a arf pint in your pocket, 'ave yer?\"\n\n\"I have nothing in my pocket,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Is this here village called Siddermorton?\" said the Tramp, rising\ncreakily to his feet and pointing to the clustering roofs down the hill.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Angel, \"they call it Siddermorton.\"\n\n\"I know it, I know it,\" said the Tramp. \"And a very pretty little\nvillage it is too.\" He stretched and yawned, and stood regarding the\nplace. \"'Ouses,\" he said reflectively; \"Projuce\"--waving his hand at the\ncornfields and orchards. \"Looks cosy, don't it?\"\n\n\"It has a quaint beauty of its own,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"It _'as_ a quaint beauty of its own--yes.... Lord! I'd like to sack\nthe blooming place.... I was born there.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Yes, I was born there. Ever heard of a pithed frog?\"\n\n\"Pithed frog,\" said the Angel. \"No!\"\n\n\"It's a thing these here vivisectionists do. They takes a frog and they\ncuts out his brains and they shoves a bit of pith in the place of 'em.\nThat's a pithed frog. Well--that there village is full of pithed human\nbeings.\"\n\nThe Angel took it quite seriously. \"Is that so?\" he said.\n\n\"That's so--you take my word for it. Everyone of them 'as 'ad their\nbrains cut out and chunks of rotten touchwood put in the place of it.\nAnd you see that little red place there?\"\n\n\"That's called the national school,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Yes--that's where they piths 'em,\" said the Tramp, quite in love with\nhis conceit.\n\n\"Really! That's very interesting.\"\n\n\"It stands to reason,\" said the Tramp. \"If they 'ad brains they'd 'ave\nideas, and if they 'ad ideas they'd think for themselves. And you can\ngo through that village from end to end and never meet anybody doing as\nmuch. Pithed human beings they are. I know that village. I was born\nthere, and I might be there now, a toilin' for my betters, if I 'adnt\nstruck against the pithin'.\"\n\n\"Is it a painful operation?\" asked the Angel.\n\n\"In parts. Though it aint the heads gets hurt. And it lasts a long time.\nThey take 'em young into that school, and they says to them, 'come in\n'ere and we'll improve your minds,' they says, and in the little kiddies\ngo as good as gold. And they begins shovin' it into them. Bit by bit and\n'ard and dry, shovin' out the nice juicy brains. Dates and lists and\nthings. Out they comes, no brains in their 'eads, and wound up nice and\ntight, ready to touch their 'ats to anyone who looks at them. Why! One\ntouched 'is 'at to me yesterday. And they runs about spry and does all\nthe dirty work, and feels thankful they're allowed to live. They take a\npositive pride in 'ard work for its own sake. Arter they bin pithed. See\nthat chap ploughin'?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Angel; \"is _he_ pithed?\"\n\n\"Rather. Else he'd be paddin' the hoof this pleasant weather--like me\nand the blessed Apostles.\"\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" said the Angel, rather dubiously.\n\n\"I knew you would,\" said the Philosophical Tramp. \"I thought you was the\nright sort. But speaking serious, aint it ridiculous?--centuries and\ncenturies of civilization, and look at that poor swine there, sweatin'\n'isself empty and trudging up that 'ill-side. 'E's English, 'e is. 'E\nbelongs to the top race in creation, 'e does. 'E's one of the rulers of\nIndjer. It's enough to make a nigger laugh. The flag that's braved a\nthousand years the battle an' the breeze--that's _'is_ flag. There never\nwas a country was as great and glorious as this. Never. And that's wot\nit makes of us. I'll tell you a little story about them parts as you\nseems to be a bit of a stranger. There's a chap called Gotch, Sir John\nGotch they calls 'im, and when _'e_ was a young gent from Oxford, I was\na little chap of eight and my sister was a girl of seventeen. Their\nservant she was. But Lord! everybody's 'eard that story--it's common\nenough, of 'im or the likes of 'im.\"\n\n\"I haven't,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"All that's pretty and lively of the gals they chucks into the gutters,\nand all the men with a pennorth of spunk or adventure, all who won't\ndrink what the Curate's wife sends 'em instead of beer, and touch their\nhats promiscous, and leave the rabbits and birds alone for their\nbetters, gets drove out of the villages as rough characters. Patriotism!\nTalk about improvin' the race! Wot's left aint fit to look a nigger in\nthe face, a Chinaman 'ud be ashamed of 'em....\"\n\n\"But I don't understand,\" said the Angel. \"I don't follow you.\"\n\nAt that the Philosophic Tramp became more explicit, and told the Angel\nthe simple story of Sir John Gotch and the kitchen-maid. It's scarcely\nnecessary to repeat it. You may understand that it left the Angel\npuzzled. It was full of words he did not understand, for the only\nvehicle of emotion the Tramp possessed was blasphemy. Yet, though their\ntongues differed so, he could still convey to the Angel some of his own\n(probably unfounded) persuasion of the injustice and cruelty of life,\nand of the utter detestableness of Sir John Gotch.\n\nThe last the Angel saw of him was his dusty black back receding down the\nlane towards Iping Hanger. A pheasant appeared by the roadside, and the\nPhilosophical Tramp immediately caught up a stone and sent the bird\nclucking with a viciously accurate shot. Then he disappeared round the\ncorner.\n\n\n\n\nMRS JEHORAM'S BREADTH OF VIEW.\n\nXXXI\n\n\n\"I heard some one playing the fiddle in the Vicarage, as I came by,\"\nsaid Mrs Jehoram, taking her cup of tea from Mrs Mendham.\n\n\"The Vicar plays,\" said Mrs Mendham. \"I have spoken to George about it,\nbut it's no good. I do not think a Vicar should be allowed to do such\nthings. It's so foreign. But there, _he_ ....\"\n\n\"I know, dear,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"But I heard the Vicar once at the\nschoolroom. I don't think this _was_ the Vicar. It was quite clever,\nsome of it, quite smart, you know. And new. I was telling dear Lady\nHammergallow this morning. I fancy--\"\n\n\"The lunatic! Very likely. These half-witted people.... My dear, I don't\nthink I shall ever forget that dreadful encounter. Yesterday.\"\n\n\"Nor I.\"\n\n\"My poor girls! They are too shocked to say a word about it. I was\ntelling dear Lady Ham----\"\n\n\"Quite proper of them. It was _dreadful_, dear. For them.\"\n\n\"And now, dear, I want you to tell me frankly--Do you really believe\nthat creature was a man?\"\n\n\"You should have heard the violin.\"\n\n\"I still more than half suspect, Jessie ----\" Mrs Mendham leant forward\nas if to whisper.\n\nMrs Jehoram helped herself to cake. \"I'm sure no woman could play the\nviolin quite like I heard it played this morning.\"\n\n\"Of course, if you say so that settles the matter,\" said Mrs Mendham.\nMrs Jehoram was the autocratic authority in Siddermorton upon all\nquestions of art, music and belles-lettres. Her late husband had been a\nminor poet. Then Mrs Mendham added a judicial \"Still--\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Mrs Jehoram, \"I'm half inclined to believe the dear\nVicar's story.\"\n\n\"How _good_ of you, Jessie,\" said Mrs Mendham.\n\n\"But really, I don't think he _could_ have had any one in the Vicarage\nbefore that afternoon. I feel sure we should have heard of it. I don't\nsee how a strange cat could come within four miles of Siddermorton\nwithout the report coming round to us. The people here gossip so....\"\n\n\"I always distrust the Vicar,\" said Mrs Mendham. \"I know him.\"\n\n\"Yes. But the story is plausible. If this Mr Angel were someone very\nclever and eccentric--\"\n\n\"He would have to be _very_ eccentric to dress as he did. There are\ndegrees and limits, dear.\"\n\n\"But kilts,\" said Mrs Jehoram.\n\n\"Are all very well in the Highlands....\"\n\nMrs Jehoram's eyes had rested upon a black speck creeping slowly across\na patch of yellowish-green up the hill.\n\n\"There he goes,\" said Mrs Jehoram, rising, \"across the cornfield. I'm\nsure that's him. I can see the hump. Unless it's a man with a sack.\nBless me, Minnie! here's an opera glass. How convenient for peeping at\nthe Vicarage!... Yes, it's the man. He is a man. With _such_ a sweet\nface.\"\n\nVery unselfishly she allowed her hostess to share the opera glass. For\na minute there was a rustling silence.\n\n\"His dress,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"is _quite_ respectable now.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Mrs Jehoram.\n\nPause.\n\n\"He looks cross!\"\n\n\"And his coat is dusty.\"\n\n\"He walks steadily enough,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"or one might think....\nThis hot weather....\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"You see, dear,\" said Mrs Jehoram, putting down the lorgnette. \"What I\nwas going to say was, that possibly he might be a genius in disguise.\"\n\n\"If you can call next door to nothing a disguise.\"\n\n\"No doubt it was eccentric. But I've seen children in little blouses,\nnot at all unlike him. So many clever people _are_ peculiar in their\ndress and manners. A genius may steal a horse where a bank-clerk may not\nlook over the hedge. Very possibly he's quite well known and laughing\nat our Arcadian simplicity. And really it wasn't so improper as some of\nthese New Women bicycling costumes. I saw one in one of the Illustrated\nPapers only a few days ago--the _New Budget_ I think--quite tights, you\nknow, dear. No--I cling to the genius theory. Especially after the\nplaying. I'm sure the creature is original. Perhaps very amusing. In\nfact, I intend to ask the Vicar to introduce me.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" cried Mrs Mendham.\n\n\"I'm resolute,\" said Mrs Jehoram.\n\n\"I'm afraid you're rash,\" said Mrs Mendham. \"Geniuses and people of that\nkind are all very well in London. But here--at the Vicarage.\"\n\n\"We are going to educate the folks. I love originality. At any rate I\nmean to see him.\"\n\n\"Take care you don't see too much of him,\" said Mrs Mendham. \"I've heard\nthe fashion is quite changing. I understand that some of the very best\npeople have decided that genius is not to be encouraged any more. These\nrecent scandals....\"\n\n\"Only in literature, I can assure you, dear. In music....\"\n\n\"Nothing you can say, my dear,\" said Mrs Mendham, going off at a\ntangent, \"will convince me that that person's costume was not extremely\nsuggestive and improper.\"\n\n\n\n\nA TRIVIAL INCIDENT.\n\nXXXII.\n\n\nThe Angel came thoughtfully by the hedge across the field towards the\nVicarage. The rays of the setting sun shone on his shoulders, and\ntouched the Vicarage with gold, and blazed like fire in all the windows.\nBy the gate, bathed in the sunlight, stood little Delia, the waiting\nmaid. She stood watching him under her hand. It suddenly came into the\nAngel's mind that she, at least, was beautiful, and not only beautiful\nbut alive and warm.\n\nShe opened the gate for him and stood aside. She was sorry for him, for\nher elder sister was a cripple. He bowed to her, as he would have done\nto any woman, and for just one moment looked into her face. She looked\nback at him and something leapt within her.\n\nThe Angel made an irresolute movement. \"Your eyes are very beautiful,\"\nhe said quietly, with a remote wonder in his voice.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" she said, starting back. The Angel's expression changed to\nperplexity. He went on up the pathway between the Vicar's flower-beds,\nand she stood with the gate held open in her hand, staring after him.\nJust under the rose-twined verandah he turned and looked at her.\n\nShe still stared at him for a moment, and then with a queer gesture\nturned round with her back to him, shutting the gate as she did so, and\nseemed to be looking down the valley towards the church tower.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WARP AND THE WOOF OF THINGS.\n\nXXXIII.\n\n\nAt the dinner table the Angel told the Vicar the more striking of his\nday's adventures.\n\n\"The strange thing,\" said the Angel, \"is the readiness of you Human\nBeings--the zest, with which you inflict pain. Those boys pelting me\nthis morning----\"\n\n\"Seemed to enjoy it,\" said the Vicar. \"I know.\"\n\n\"Yet they don't like pain,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"No,\" said the Vicar; \"_they_ don't like it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Angel, \"I saw some beautiful plants rising with a spike\nof leaves, two this way and two that, and when I caressed one it caused\nthe most uncomfortable----\"\n\n\"Stinging nettle!\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"At any rate a new sort of pain. And another plant with a head like a\ncoronet, and richly decorated leaves, spiked and jagged----\"\n\n\"A thistle, possibly.\"\n\n\"And in your garden, the beautiful, sweet-smelling plant----\"\n\n\"The sweet briar,\" said the Vicar. \"I remember.\"\n\n\"And that pink flower that sprang out of the box----\"\n\n\"Out of the box?\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Last night,\" said the Angel, \"that went climbing up the\ncurtains---- Flame!\"\n\n\"Oh!--the matches and the candles! Yes,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"Then the animals. A dog to-day behaved most disagreeably----. And these\nboys, and the way in which people speak----. Everyone seems\nanxious--willing at any rate--to give this Pain. Every one seems busy\ngiving pain----\"\n\n\"Or avoiding it,\" said the Vicar, pushing his dinner away before him.\n\"Yes--of course. It's fighting everywhere. The whole living world is a\nbattle-field--the whole world. We are driven by Pain. Here. How it lies\non the surface! This Angel sees it in a day!\"\n\n\"But why does everyone--everything--want to give pain?\" asked the Angel.\n\n\"It is not so in the Angelic Land?\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"No,\" said the Angel. \"Why is it so here?\"\n\nThe Vicar wiped his lips with his napkin slowly. \"It _is_ so,\" he said.\n\"Pain,\" said he still more slowly, \"is the warp and the woof of this\nlife. Do you know,\" he said, after a pause, \"it is almost impossible for\nme to imagine ... a world without pain.... And yet, as you played this\nmorning----\n\n\"But this world is different. It is the very reverse of an Angelic\nworld. Indeed, a number of people--excellent religious people--have been\nso impressed by the universality of pain that they think, after death,\nthings will be even worse for a great many of us. It seems to me an\nexcessive view. But it's a deep question. Almost beyond one's power of\ndiscussion----\"\n\nAnd incontinently the Vicar plumped into an impromptu dissertation upon\n\"Necessity,\" how things were so because they were so, how one _had_ to\ndo this and that. \"Even our food,\" said the Vicar. \"What?\" said the\nAngel. \"Is not obtained without inflicting Pain,\" said the Vicar.\n\nThe Angel's face went so white that the Vicar checked himself suddenly.\nOr he was just on the very verge of a concise explanation of the\nantecedents of a leg of lamb. There was a pause.\n\n\"By-the-bye,\" said the Angel, suddenly. \"Have you been pithed? Like the\ncommon people.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANGEL'S DEBUT.\n\nXXXIV.\n\n\nWhen Lady Hammergallow made up her mind, things happened as she\nresolved. And though the Vicar made a spasmodic protest, she carried out\nher purpose and got audience, Angel, and violin together, at\nSiddermorton House before the week was out. \"A genius the Vicar has\ndiscovered,\" she said; so with eminent foresight putting any possibility\nof blame for a failure on the Vicar's shoulders. \"The dear Vicar tells\nme,\" she would say, and proceed to marvellous anecdotes of the Angel's\ncleverness with his instrument. But she was quite in love with her\nidea--she had always had a secret desire to play the patroness to\nobscure talent. Hitherto it had not turned out to be talent when it came\nto the test.\n\n\"It would be such a good thing for him,\" she said. \"His hair is long\nalready, and with that high colour he would be beautiful, simply\nbeautiful on a platform. The Vicar's clothes fitting him so badly makes\nhim look quite like a fashionable pianist already. And the scandal of\nhis birth--not told, of course, but whispered--would be--quite an\nInducement----when he gets to London, that is.\"\n\nThe Vicar had the most horrible sensations as the day approached. He\nspent hours trying to explain the situation to the Angel, other hours\ntrying to imagine what people would think, still worse hours trying to\nanticipate the Angel's behaviour. Hitherto the Angel had always played\nfor his own satisfaction. The Vicar would startle him every now and then\nby rushing upon him with some new point of etiquette that had just\noccurred to him. As for instance: \"It's very important where you put\nyour hat, you know. Don't put it on a chair, whatever you do. Hold it\nuntil you get your tea, you know, and then--let me see--then put it down\nsomewhere, you know.\" The journey to Siddermorton House was\naccomplished without misadventure, but at the moment of introduction\nthe Vicar had a spasm of horrible misgivings. He had forgotten to\nexplain introductions. The Angel's na\u00c3\u00afve amusement was evident, but\nnothing very terrible happened.\n\n\"Rummy looking greaser,\" said Mr Rathbone Slater, who devoted\nconsiderable attention to costume. \"Wants grooming. No manners. Grinned\nwhen he saw me shaking hands. Did it _chic_ enough, I thought.\"\n\nOne trivial misadventure occurred. When Lady Hammergallow welcomed the\nAngel she looked at him through her glasses. The apparent size of her\neyes startled him. His surprise and his quick attempt to peer over the\nbrims was only too evident. But the Vicar had warned him of the ear\ntrumpet.\n\nThe Angel's incapacity to sit on anything but a music stool appeared to\nexcite some interest among the ladies, but led to no remarks. They\nregarded it perhaps as the affectation of a budding professional. He was\nremiss with the teacups and scattered the crumbs of his cake abroad.\n(You must remember he was quite an amateur at eating.) He crossed his\nlegs. He fumbled over the hat business after vainly trying to catch the\nVicar's eye. The eldest Miss Papaver tried to talk to him about\ncontinental watering places and cigarettes, and formed a low opinion of\nhis intelligence.\n\nThe Angel was surprised by the production of an easel and several books\nof music, and a little unnerved at first by the sight of Lady\nHammergallow sitting with her head on one side, watching him with those\nmagnified eyes through her gilt glasses.\n\nMrs Jehoram came up to him before he began to play and asked him the\nName of the Charming Piece he was playing the other afternoon. The Angel\nsaid it had no name, and Mrs Jehoram thought music ought never to have\nany names and wanted to know who it was by, and when the Angel told her\nhe played it out of his head, she said he must be Quite a Genius and\nlooked open (and indisputably fascinating) admiration at him. The Curate\nfrom Iping Hanger (who was professionally a Kelt and who played the\npiano and talked colour and music with an air of racial superiority)\nwatched him jealously.\n\nThe Vicar, who was presently captured and set down next to Lady\nHammergallow, kept an anxious eye ever Angelward while she told him\nparticulars of the incomes made by violinists--particulars which, for\nthe most part, she invented as she went along. She had been a little\nruffled by the incident of the glasses, but had decided that it came\nwithin the limits of permissible originality.\n\nSo figure to yourself the Green Saloon at Siddermorton Park; an Angel\nthinly disguised in clerical vestments and with a violin in his hands,\nstanding by the grand piano, and a respectable gathering of quiet nice\npeople, nicely dressed, grouped about the room. Anticipatory gabble--one\nhears scattered fragments of conversation.\n\n\"He is _incog._\"; said the very eldest Miss Papaver to Mrs Pirbright.\n\"Isn't it quaint and delicious. Jessica Jehoram says she saw him at\nVienna, but she can't remember the name. The Vicar knows all about him,\nbut he is so close----\"\n\n\"How hot and uncomfortable the dear Vicar is looking,\" said Mrs\nPirbright. \"I've noticed it before when he sits next to Lady\nHammergallow. She simply will _not_ respect his cloth. She goes on----\"\n\n\"His tie is all askew,\" said the very eldest Miss Papaver, \"and his\nhair! It really hardly looks as though he had brushed it all day.\"\n\n\"Seems a foreign sort of chap. Affected. All very well in a\ndrawing-room,\" said George Harringay, sitting apart with the younger\nMiss Pirbright. \"But for my part give me a masculine man and a feminine\nwoman. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh!--I think so too,\" said the younger Miss Pirbright.\n\n\"Guineas and guineas,\" said Lady Hammergallow. \"I've heard that some of\nthem keep quite stylish establishments. You would scarcely credit\nit----\"\n\n\"I love music, Mr Angel, I adore it. It stirs something in me. I can\nscarcely describe it,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"Who is it says that delicious\nantithesis: Life without music is brutality; music without life\nis---- Dear me! perhaps you remember? Music without life----it's Ruskin\nI think?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I do not,\" said the Angel. \"I have read very few books.\"\n\n\"How charming of you!\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"I wish I didn't. I sympathise\nwith you profoundly. I would do the same, only we poor women----I\nsuppose it's originality we lack---- And down here one is driven to the\nmost desperate proceedings----\"\n\n\"He's certainly very _pretty_. But the ultimate test of a man is his\nstrength,\" said George Harringay. \"What do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh!--I think so too,\" said the younger Miss Pirbright.\n\n\"It's the effeminate man who makes the masculine woman. When the glory\nof a man is his hair, what's a woman to do? And when men go running\nabout with beautiful hectic dabs----\"\n\n\"Oh George! You are so dreadfully satirical to-day,\" said the younger\nMiss Pirbright. \"I'm _sure_ it isn't paint.\"\n\n\"I'm really not his guardian, my dear Lady Hammergallow. Of course it's\nvery kind indeed of you to take such an interest----\"\n\n\"Are you really going to improvise?\" said Mrs Jehoram in a state of\ncooing delight.\n\n\"_SSsh!_\" said the curate from Iping Hanger.\n\nThen the Angel began to play, looking straight before him as he did so,\nthinking of the wonderful things of the Angelic Land, and yet insensibly\nletting the sadness he was beginning to feel, steal over the fantasia he\nwas playing. When he forgot his company the music was strange and sweet;\nwhen the sense of his surroundings floated into his mind the music grew\ncapricious and grotesque. But so great was the hold of the Angelic music\nupon the Vicar that his anxieties fell from him at once, so soon as the\nAngel began to play. Mrs Jehoram sat and looked rapt and sympathetic as\nhard as she could (though the music was puzzling at times) and tried to\ncatch the Angel's eye. He really had a wonderfully mobile face, and the\ntenderest shades of expression! And Mrs Jehoram was a judge. George\nHarringay looked bored, until the younger Miss Pirbright, who adored\nhim, put out her mousy little shoe to touch his manly boot, and then he\nturned his face to catch the feminine delicacy of her coquettish eye,\nand was comforted. The very eldest Miss Papaver and Mrs Pirbright sat\nquite still and looked churchy for nearly four minutes.\n\nThen said the eldest Miss Papaver in a whisper, \"I always Enjoy violin\nmusic so much.\" And Mrs Pirbright answered, \"We get so little Nice music\ndown here.\" And Miss Papaver said, \"He plays Very nicely.\" And Mrs\nPirbright, \"Such a Delicate Touch!\" And Miss Papaver, \"Does Willie keep\nup his lessons?\" and so to a whispered conversation.\n\nThe Curate from Iping Hanger sat (he felt) in full view of the company.\nHe had one hand curled round his ear, and his eyes hard and staring\nfixedly at the pedestal of the Hammergallow S\u00c3\u00a8vres vase. He supplied, by\nthe movements of his mouth, a kind of critical guide to any of the\ncompany who were disposed to avail themselves of it. It was a generous\nway he had. His aspect was severely judicial, tempered by starts of\nevident disapproval and guarded appreciation. The Vicar leaned back in\nhis chair and stared at the Angel's face, and was presently rapt away in\na wonderful dream. Lady Hammergallow, with quick jerky movements of the\nhead and a low but insistent rustling, surveyed and tried to judge of\nthe effect of the Angelic playing. Mr Rathbone-Slater stared very\nsolemnly into his hat and looked very miserable, and Mrs Rathbone-Slater\nmade mental memoranda of Mrs Jehoram's sleeves. And the air about them\nall was heavy with exquisite music--for all that had ears to hear.\n\n\"Scarcely affected enough,\" whispered Lady Hammergallow hoarsely,\nsuddenly poking the Vicar in the ribs. The Vicar came out of Dreamland\nsuddenly. \"Eigh?\" shouted the Vicar, startled, coming up with a jump.\n\"Sssh!\" said the Curate from Iping Hanger, and everyone looked shocked\nat the brutal insensibility of Hilyer. \"So unusual of the Vicar,\" said\nthe very eldest Miss Papaver, \"to do things like that!\" The Angel went\non playing.\n\nThe Curate from Iping Hanger began making mesmeric movements with his\nindex finger, and as the thing proceeded Mr Rathbone-Slater got\namazingly limp. He solemnly turned his hat round and altered his view.\nThe Vicar lapsed from an uneasy discomfort into dreamland again. Lady\nHammergallow rustled a great deal, and presently found a way of making\nher chair creak. And at last the thing came to an end. Lady Hammergallow\nexclaimed \"De--licious!\" though she had never heard a note, and began\nclapping her hands. At that everyone clapped except Mr Rathbone-Slater,\nwho rapped his hat brim instead. The Curate from Iping Hanger clapped\nwith a judicial air.\n\n\"So I said (_clap, clap, clap_), if you cannot cook the food my way\n(_clap, clap, clap_) you must _go_,\" said Mrs Pirbright, clapping\nvigorously. \"(This music is a delightful treat.)\"\n\n\"(It is. I always _revel_ in music,)\" said the very eldest Miss Papaver.\n\"And did she improve after that?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Mrs Pirbright.\n\nThe Vicar woke up again and stared round the saloon. Did other people\nsee these visions, or were they confined to him alone? Surely they must\nall see ... and have a wonderful command of their feelings. It was\nincredible that such music should not affect them. \"He's a trifle\n_gauche_,\" said Lady Hammergallow, jumping upon the Vicar's attention.\n\"He neither bows nor smiles. He must cultivate oddities like that. Every\nsuccessful executant is more or less _gauche_.\"\n\n\"Did you really make that up yourself?\" said Mrs Jehoram, sparkling her\neyes at him, \"as you went along. Really, it is _wonderful_! Nothing less\nthan wonderful.\"\n\n\"A little amateurish,\" said the Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr\nRathbone-Slater. \"A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of\nsustained training. There were one or two little things ... I would like\nto talk to him.\"\n\n\"His trousers look like concertinas,\" said Mr Rathbone-Slater. \"He ought\nto be told _that_. It's scarcely decent.\"\n\n\"Can you do Imitations, Mr Angel?\" said Lady Hammergallow.\n\n\"Oh _do_, do some Imitations!\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"I adore Imitations.\"\n\n\"It was a fantastic thing,\" said the Curate of Iping Hanger to the\nVicar of Siddermorton, waving his long indisputably musical hands as he\nspoke; \"a little involved, to my mind. I have heard it before\nsomewhere--I forget where. He has genius undoubtedly, but occasionally\nhe is--loose. There is a certain deadly precision wanting. There are\nyears of discipline yet.\"\n\n\"I _don't_ admire these complicated pieces of music,\" said George\nHarringay. \"I have simple tastes, I'm afraid. There seems to me no\n_tune_ in it. There's nothing I like so much as simple music. Tune,\nsimplicity is the need of the age, in my opinion. We are so over subtle.\nEverything is far-fetched. Home grown thoughts and 'Home, Sweet Home'\nfor me. What do you think?\"\n\n\"Oh! I think so--_quite_,\" said the younger Miss Pirbright.\n\n\"Well, Amy, chattering to George as usual?\" said Mrs Pirbright, across\nthe room.\n\n\"As usual, Ma!\" said the younger Miss Pirbright, glancing round with a\nbright smile at Miss Papaver, and turning again so as not to lose the\nnext utterance from George.\n\n\"I wonder if you and Mr Angel could manage a duet?\" said Lady\nHammergallow to the Curate from Iping Hanger, who was looking\npreternaturally gloomy.\n\n\"I'm sure I should be delighted,\" said the Curate from Iping Hanger,\nbrightening up.\n\n\"Duets!\" said the Angel; \"the two of us. Then he can play. I\nunderstood--the Vicar told me--\"\n\n\"Mr Wilmerdings is an accomplished pianist,\" interrupted the Vicar.\n\n\"But the Imitations?\" said Mrs Jehoram, who detested Wilmerdings.\n\n\"Imitations!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"A pig squeaking, a cock crowing, you know,\" said Mr Rathbone-Slater,\nand added lower, \"Best fun you can get out of a fiddle--_my_ opinion.\"\n\n\"I really don't understand,\" said the Angel. \"A pig crowing!\"\n\n\"You don't like Imitations,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"Nor do I--really. I\naccept the snub. I think they degrade....\"\n\n\"Perhaps afterwards Mr Angel will Relent,\" said Lady Hammergallow, when\nMrs Pirbright had explained the matter to her. She could scarcely credit\nher ear-trumpet. When she asked for Imitations she was accustomed to get\nImitations.\n\nMr Wilmerdings had seated himself at the piano, and had turned to a\nfamiliar pile of music in the recess. \"What do you think of that\nBarcarole thing of Spohr's?\" he said over his shoulder. \"I suppose you\nknow it?\" The Angel looked bewildered.\n\nHe opened the folio before the Angel.\n\n\"What an odd kind of book!\" said the Angel. \"What do all those crazy\ndots mean?\" (At that the Vicar's blood ran cold.)\n\n\"What dots?\" said the Curate.\n\n\"There!\" said the Angel with incriminating finger.\n\n\"Oh _come_!\" said the Curate.\n\nThere was one of those swift, short silences that mean so much in a\nsocial gathering.\n\nThen the eldest Miss Papaver turned upon the Vicar. \"Does not Mr Angel\nplay from ordinary.... Music--from the ordinary notation?\"\n\n\"I have never heard,\" said the Vicar, getting red now after the first\nshock of horror. \"I have really never seen....\"\n\nThe Angel felt the situation was strained, though what was straining it\nhe could not understand. He became aware of a doubtful, an unfriendly\nlook upon the faces that regarded him. \"Impossible!\" he heard Mrs\nPirbright say; \"after that _beautiful_ music.\" The eldest Miss Papaver\nwent to Lady Hammergallow at once, and began to explain into her\near-trumpet that Mr Angel did not wish to play with Mr Wilmerdings, and\nalleged an ignorance of written music.\n\n\"He cannot play from Notes!\" said Lady Hammergallow in a voice of\nmeasured horror. \"Non--sense!\"\n\n\"Notes!\" said the Angel perplexed. \"Are these notes?\"\n\n\"It's carrying the joke too far--simply because he doesn't want to play\nwith Wilmerdings,\" said Mr Rathbone-Slater to George Harringay.\n\nThere was an expectant pause. The Angel perceived he had to be ashamed\nof himself. He was ashamed of himself.\n\n\"Then,\" said Lady Hammergallow, throwing her head back and speaking with\ndeliberate indignation, as she rustled forward, \"if you cannot play with\nMr Wilmerdings I am afraid I cannot ask you to play again.\" She made it\nsound like an ultimatum. Her glasses in her hand quivered violently with\nindignation. The Angel was now human enough to appreciate the fact that\nhe was crushed.\n\n\"What is it?\" said little Lucy Rustchuck in the further bay.\n\n\"He's refused to play with old Wilmerdings,\" said Tommy Rathbone-Slater.\n\"What a lark! The old girl's purple. She thinks heaps of that ass,\nWilmerdings.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Mr Wilmerdings, you will favour us with that delicious\nPolonaise of Chopin's,\" said Lady Hammergallow. Everybody else was\nhushed. The indignation of Lady Hammergallow inspired much the same\nsilence as a coming earthquake or an eclipse. Mr Wilmerdings perceived\nhe would be doing a real social service to begin at once, and (be it\nentered to his credit now that his account draws near its settlement) he\ndid.\n\n\"If a man pretend to practise an Art,\" said George Harringay, \"he ought\nat least to have the conscience to study the elements of it. What do\nyou....\"\n\n\"Oh! I think so too,\" said the younger Miss Pirbright.\n\nThe Vicar felt that the heavens had fallen. He sat crumpled up in his\nchair, a shattered man. Lady Hammergallow sat down next to him without\nappearing to see him. She was breathing heavily, but her face was\nterribly calm. Everyone sat down. Was the Angel grossly ignorant or only\ngrossly impertinent? The Angel was vaguely aware of some frightful\noffence, aware that in some mysterious way he had ceased to be the\ncentre of the gathering. He saw reproachful despair in the Vicar's eye.\nHe drifted slowly towards the window in the recess and sat down on the\nlittle octagonal Moorish stool by the side of Mrs Jehoram. And under the\ncircumstances he appreciated at more than its proper value Mrs Jehoram's\nkindly smile. He put down the violin in the window seat.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV.\n\n\nMrs Jehoram and the Angel (apart)--Mr Wilmerdings playing.\n\n\"I have so longed for a quiet word with you,\" said Mrs Jehoram in a low\ntone. \"To tell you how delightful I found your playing.\"\n\n\"I am glad it pleased you,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Pleased is scarcely the word,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"I was\nmoved--profoundly. These others did not understand.... I was glad you\ndid not play with him.\"\n\nThe Angel looked at the mechanism called Wilmerdings, and felt glad too.\n(The Angelic conception of duets is a kind of conversation upon\nviolins.) But he said nothing.\n\n\"I worship music,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"I know nothing about it\ntechnically, but there is something in it--a longing, a wish....\"\n\nThe Angel stared at her face. She met his eyes.\n\n\"You understand,\" she said. \"I see you understand.\" He was certainly a\nvery nice boy, sentimentally precocious perhaps, and with deliciously\nliquid eyes.\n\nThere was an interval of Chopin (Op. 40) played with immense precision.\n\nMrs Jehoram had a sweet face still, in shadow, with the light falling\nround her golden hair, and a curious theory flashed across the Angel's\nmind. The perceptible powder only supported his view of something\ninfinitely bright and lovable caught, tarnished, coarsened, coated over.\n\n\"Do you,\" said the Angel in a low tone. \"Are you ... separated from ...\n_your_ world?\"\n\n\"As you are?\" whispered Mrs Jehoram.\n\n\"This is so--cold,\" said the Angel. \"So harsh!\" He meant the whole\nworld.\n\n\"I feel it too,\" said Mrs Jehoram, referring to Siddermorton Home.\n\n\"There are those who cannot live without sympathy,\" she said after a\nsympathetic pause. \"And times when one feels alone in the world.\nFighting a battle against it all. Laughing, flirting, hiding the pain of\nit....\"\n\n\"And hoping,\" said the Angel with a wonderful glance.--\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs Jehoram (who was an epicure of flirtations) felt the Angel was more\nthan redeeming the promise of his appearance. (Indisputably he\nworshipped her.) \"Do _you_ look for sympathy?\" she said. \"Or have you\nfound it?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the Angel, very softly, leaning forward, \"I think I have\nfound it.\"\n\nInterval of Chopin Op. 40. The very eldest Miss Papaver and Mrs\nPirbright whispering. Lady Hammergallow (glasses up) looking down the\nsaloon with an unfriendly expression at the Angel. Mrs Jehoram and the\nAngel exchanging deep and significant glances.\n\n\"Her name,\" said the Angel (Mrs Jehoram made a movement) \"is Delia. She\nis....\"\n\n\"Delia!\" said Mrs Jehoram sharply, slowly realising a terrible\nmisunderstanding. \"A fanciful name.... Why!... No! Not that little\nhousemaid at the Vicarage--?...\"\n\nThe Polonaise terminated with a flourish. The Angel was quite surprised\nat the change in Mrs Jehoram's expression.\n\n\"_I never_ did!\" said Mrs Jehoram recovering. \"To make me your\nconfidant in an intrigue with a servant. Really Mr Angel it's possible\nto be too original....\"\n\nThen suddenly their colloquy was interrupted.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI.\n\n\nThis section is (so far as my memory goes) the shortest in the book.\n\nBut the enormity of the offence necessitates the separation of this\nsection from all other sections.\n\nThe Vicar, you must understand, had done his best to inculcate the\nrecognised differentiae of a gentleman. \"Never allow a lady to carry\nanything,\" said the Vicar. \"Say, 'permit me' and relieve her.\" \"Always\nstand until every lady is seated.\" \"Always rise and open a door for a\nlady....\" and so forth. (All men who have elder sisters know that code.)\n\nAnd the Angel (who had failed to relieve Lady Hammergallow of her\nteacup) danced forward with astonishing dexterity (leaving Mrs Jehoram\nin the window seat) and with an elegant \"permit me\" rescued the tea-tray\nfrom Lady Hammergallow's pretty parlour-maid and vanished officiously in\nfront of her. The Vicar rose to his feet with an inarticulate cry.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII.\n\n\n\"He's drunk!\" said Mr Rathbone-Slater, breaking a terrific silence.\n\"That's the matter with _him_.\"\n\nMrs Jehoram laughed hysterically.\n\nThe Vicar stood up, motionless, staring. \"Oh! I _forgot_ to explain\nservants to him!\" said the Vicar to himself in a swift outbreak of\nremorse. \"I thought he _did_ understand servants.\"\n\n\"Really, Mr Hilyer!\" said Lady Hammergallow, evidently exercising\nenormous self-control and speaking in panting spasms. \"Really, Mr\nHilyer!--Your genius is _too_ terrible. I must, I really _must_, ask you\nto take him home.\"\n\nSo to the dialogue in the corridor of alarmed maid-servant and\nwell-meaning (but shockingly _gauche_) Angel--appears the Vicar, his\nbotryoidal little face crimson, gaunt despair in his eyes, and his\nnecktie under his left ear.\n\n\"Come,\" he said--struggling with emotion. \"Come away.... I.... I am\ndisgraced for ever.\"\n\nAnd the Angel stared for a second at him and obeyed--meekly, perceiving\nhimself in the presence of unknown but evidently terrible forces.\n\nAnd so began and ended the Angel's social career.\n\nIn the informal indignation meeting that followed, Lady Hammergallow\ntook the (informal) chair. \"I feel humiliated,\" she said. \"The Vicar\nassured me he was an exquisite player. I never imagined....\"\n\n\"He was drunk,\" said Mr Rathbone-Slater. \"You could tell it from the way\nhe fumbled with his tea.\"\n\n\"Such a _fiasco_!\" said Mrs Mergle.\n\n\"The Vicar assured me,\" said Lady Hammergallow. \"'The man I have staying\nwith me is a musical genius,' he said. His very words.\"\n\n\"His ears must be burning anyhow,\" said Tommy Rathbone-Slater.\n\n\"I was trying to keep him Quiet,\" said Mrs Jehoram. \"By humouring him.\nAnd do you know the things he said to me--there!\"\n\n\"The thing he played,\" said Mr Wilmerdings,\"--I must confess I did not\nlike to charge him to his face. But really! It was merely _drifting_.\"\n\n\"Just fooling with a fiddle, eigh?\" said George Harringay. \"Well I\nthought it was beyond me. So much of your fine music is--\"\n\n\"Oh, _George_!\" said the younger Miss Pirbright.\n\n\"The Vicar was a bit on too--to judge by his tie,\" said Mr\nRathbone-Slater. \"It's a dashed rummy go. Did you notice how he fussed\nafter the genius?\"\n\n\"One has to be so very careful,\" said the very eldest Miss Papaver.\n\n\"He told me he is in love with the Vicar's housemaid!\" said Mrs Jehoram.\n\"I almost laughed in his face.\"\n\n\"The Vicar ought _never_ to have brought him here,\" said Mrs\nRathbone-Slater with decision.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TROUBLE OF THE BARBED WIRE.\n\nXXXVIII.\n\n\nSo, ingloriously, ended the Angel's first and last appearance in\nSociety. Vicar and Angel returned to the Vicarage; crestfallen black\nfigures in the bright sunlight, going dejectedly. The Angel, deeply\npained that the Vicar was pained. The Vicar, dishevelled and desperate,\nintercalating spasmodic remorse and apprehension with broken\nexplanations of the Theory of Etiquette. \"They do _not_ understand,\"\nsaid the Vicar over and over again. \"They will all be so very much\naggrieved. I do not know what to say to them. It is all so confused, so\nperplexing.\" And at the gate of the Vicarage, at the very spot where\nDelia had first seemed beautiful, stood Horrocks the village constable,\nawaiting them. He held coiled up about his hand certain short lengths of\nbarbed wire.\n\n\"Good evening, Horrocks,\" said the Vicar as the constable held the gate\nopen.\n\n\"Evenin', Sir,\" said Horrocks, and added in a kind of mysterious\nundertone, \"_Could_ I speak to you a minute, Sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the Vicar. The Angel walked on thoughtfully to the\nhouse, and meeting Delia in the hall stopped her and cross-examined her\nat length over differences between Servants and Ladies.\n\n\"You'll excuse my taking the liberty, Sir,\" said Horrocks, \"but there's\ntrouble brewin' for that crippled gent you got stayin' here.\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" said the Vicar. \"You don't say so!\"\n\n\"Sir John Gotch, Sir. He's very angry indeed, Sir. His language,\nSir----. But I felt bound to tell you, Sir. He's certain set on taking\nout a summons on account of that there barbed wire. Certain set, Sir, he\nis.\"\n\n\"Sir John Gotch!\" said the Vicar. \"Wire! I don't understand.\"\n\n\"He asked me to find out who did it. Course I've had to do my duty, Sir.\nNaturally a disagreeable one.\"\n\n\"Barbed wire! Duty! I don't understand you, Horrocks.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid, Sir, there's no denying the evidence. I've made careful\nenquiries, Sir.\" And forthwith the constable began telling the Vicar of\na new and terrible outrage committed by the Angelic visitor.\n\nBut we need not follow that explanation in detail--or the subsequent\nconfession. (For my own part I think there is nothing more tedious than\ndialogue). It gave the Vicar a new view of the Angelic character, a\nvignette of the Angelic indignation. A shady lane, sun-mottled, sweet\nhedges full of honeysuckle and vetch on either side, and a little girl\ngathering flowers, forgetful of the barbed wire which, all along the\nSidderford Road, fenced in the dignity of Sir John Gotch from \"bounders\"\nand the detested \"million.\" Then suddenly a gashed hand, a bitter\noutcry, and the Angel sympathetic, comforting, inquisitive. Explanations\nsob-set, and then--altogether novel phenomenon in the Angelic\ncareer--_passion_. A furious onslaught upon the barbed wire of Sir John\nGotch, barbed wire recklessly handled, slashed, bent and broken. Yet\nthe Angel acted without personal malice--saw in the thing only an ugly\nand vicious plant that trailed insidiously among its fellows. Finally\nthe Angel's explanations gave the Vicar a picture of the Angel alone\namidst his destruction, trembling and amazed at the sudden force, not\nhimself, that had sprung up within him, and set him striking and\ncutting. Amazed, too, at the crimson blood that trickled down his\nfingers.\n\n\"It is still more horrible,\" said the Angel when the Vicar explained the\nartificial nature of the thing. \"If I had seen the man who put this\nsilly-cruel stuff there to hurt little children, I know I should have\ntried to inflict pain upon him. I have never felt like this before. I am\nindeed becoming tainted and coloured altogether by the wickedness of\nthis world.\"\n\n\"To think, too, that you men should be so foolish as to uphold the laws\nthat let a man do such spiteful things. Yes--I know; you will say it has\nto be so. For some remoter reason. That is a thing that only makes me\nangrier. Why cannot an act rest on its own merits?... As it does in the\nAngelic Land.\"\n\nThat was the incident the history of which the Vicar now gradually\nlearnt, getting the bare outline from Horrocks, the colour and emotion\nsubsequently from the Angel. The thing had happened the day before the\nmusical festival at Siddermorton House.\n\n\"Have you told Sir John who did it?\" asked the Vicar. \"And are you\nsure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, Sir. There can be no doubting it was your gentleman, Sir.\nI've not told Sir John yet, Sir. But I shall have to tell Sir John this\nevening. Meaning no offence to you, Sir, as I hopes you'll see. It's my\nduty, Sir. Besides which--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Vicar, hastily. \"Certainly it's your duty. And\nwhat will Sir John do?\"\n\n\"He's dreadful set against the person who did it--destroying property\nlike that--and sort of slapping his arrangements in the face.\"\n\nPause. Horrocks made a movement. The Vicar, tie almost at the back of\nhis neck now, a most unusual thing for him, stared blankly at his toes.\n\n\"I thought I'd tell you, Sir,\" said Horrocks.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Vicar. \"Thanks, Horrocks, thanks!\" He scratched the\nback of his head. \"You might perhaps ... I think it's the best way ...\nQuite sure Mr Angel did it?\"\n\n\"Sherlock 'Omes, Sir, couldn't be cocksurer.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better give you a little note to the Squire.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX.\n\n\nThe Vicar's table-talk at dinner that night, after the Angel had stated\nhis case, was full of grim explanations, prisons, madness.\n\n\"It's too late to tell the truth about you now,\" said the Vicar.\n\"Besides, that's impossible. I really do not know what to say. We must\nface our circumstances, I suppose. I am so undecided--so torn. It's the\ntwo worlds. If your Angelic world were only a dream, or if _this_ world\nwere only a dream--or if I could believe either or both dreams, it would\nbe all right with me. But here is a real Angel and a real summons--how\nto reconcile them I do not know. I must talk to Gotch.... But he won't\nunderstand. Nobody will understand....\"\n\n\"I am putting you to terrible inconvenience, I am afraid. My appalling\nunworldliness--\"\n\n\"It's not you,\" said the Vicar. \"It's not you. I perceive you have\nbrought something strange and beautiful into my life. It's not you.\nIt's myself. If I had more faith either way. If I could believe entirely\nin this world, and call you an Abnormal Phenomenon, as Crump does. But\nno. Terrestrial Angelic, Angelic Terrestrial.... See-Saw.\"\n\n\"Still, Gotch is certain to be disagreeable, _most_ disagreeable. He\nalways is. It puts me into his hands. He is a bad moral influence, I\nknow. Drinking. Gambling. Worse. Still, one must render unto C\u00c3\u00a6sar the\nthings that are C\u00c3\u00a6sar's. And he is against Disestablishment....\"\n\nThen the Vicar would revert to the social collapse of the afternoon.\n\"You are so very fundamental, you know,\" he said--several times.\n\nThe Angel went to his own room puzzled but very depressed. Every day the\nworld had frowned darker upon him and his angelic ways. He could see how\nthe trouble affected the Vicar, yet he could not imagine how he could\navert it. It was all so strange and unreasonable. Twice again, too, he\nhad been pelted out of the village.\n\nHe found the violin lying on his bed where he had laid it before\ndinner. And taking it up he began to play to comfort himself. But now he\nplayed no delicious vision of the Angelic Land. The iron of the world\nwas entering into his soul. For a week now he had known pain and\nrejection, suspicion and hatred; a strange new spirit of revolt was\ngrowing up in his heart. He played a melody, still sweet and tender as\nthose of the Angelic Land, but charged with a new note, the note of\nhuman sorrow and effort, now swelling into something like defiance,\ndying now into a plaintive sadness. He played softly, playing to himself\nto comfort himself, but the Vicar heard, and all his finite bothers were\nswallowed up in a hazy melancholy, a melancholy that was quite remote\nfrom sorrow. And besides the Vicar, the Angel had another hearer of whom\nneither Angel nor Vicar was thinking.\n\n\n\n\nDELIA.\n\nXL.\n\n\nShe was only four or five yards away from the Angel in the westward\ngable. The diamond-paned window of her little white room was open. She\nknelt on her box of japanned tin, and rested her chin on her hands, her\nelbows on the window-sill. The young moon hung over the pine trees, and\nits light, cool and colourless, lay softly upon the silent-sleeping\nworld. Its light fell upon her white face, and discovered new depths in\nher dreaming eyes. Her soft lips fell apart and showed the little white\nteeth.\n\nDelia was thinking, vaguely, wonderfully, as girls will think. It was\nfeeling rather than thinking; clouds of beautiful translucent emotion\ndrove across the clear sky of her mind, taking shape that changed and\nvanished. She had all that wonderful emotional tenderness, that subtle\nexquisite desire for self-sacrifice, which exists so inexplicably in a\ngirl's heart, exists it seems only to be presently trampled under foot\nby the grim and gross humours of daily life, to be ploughed in again\nroughly and remorselessly, as the farmer ploughs in the clover that has\nsprung up in the soil. She had been looking out at the tranquillity of\nthe moonlight long before the Angel began to play,--waiting; then\nsuddenly the quiet, motionless beauty of silver and shadow was suffused\nwith tender music.\n\nShe did not move, but her lips closed and her eyes grew even softer. She\nhad been thinking before of the strange glory that had suddenly flashed\nout about the stooping hunchback when he spoke to her in the sunset; of\nthat and of a dozen other glances, chance turns, even once the touching\nof her hand. That afternoon he had spoken to her, asking strange\nquestions. Now the music seemed to bring his very face before her, his\nlook of half curious solicitude, peering into her face, into her eyes,\ninto her and through her, deep down into her soul. He seemed now to be\nspeaking directly to her, telling her of his solitude and trouble. Oh!\nthat regret, that longing! For he was in trouble. And how could a\nservant-girl help him, this soft-spoken gentleman who carried himself so\nkindly, who played so sweetly. The music was so sweet and keen, it came\nso near to the thought of her heart, that presently one hand tightened\non the other, and the tears came streaming down her face.\n\nAs Crump would tell you, people do not do that kind of thing unless\nthere is something wrong with the nervous system. But then, from the\nscientific point of view, being in love is a pathological condition.\n\n\nI am painfully aware of the objectionable nature of my story here. I\nhave even thought of wilfully perverting the truth to propitiate the\nLady Reader. But I could not. The story has been too much for me. I do\nthe thing with my eyes open. Delia must remain what she really was--a\nservant girl. I know that to give a mere servant girl, or at least an\nEnglish servant girl, the refined feelings of a human being, to present\nher as speaking with anything but an intolerable confusion of aspirates,\nplaces me outside the pale of respectable writers. Association with\nservants, even in thought, is dangerous in these days. I can only plead\n(pleading vainly, I know), that Delia was a very exceptional servant\ngirl. Possibly, if one enquired, it might be found that her parentage\nwas upper middle-class--that she was made of the finer upper\nmiddle-class clay. And (this perhaps may avail me better) I will promise\nthat in some future work I will redress the balance, and the patient\nreader shall have the recognised article, enormous feet and hands,\nsystematic aspiration of vowels and elimination of aspirates, no figure\n(only middle-class girls have figures--the thing is beyond a\nservant-girl's means), a fringe (by agreement), and a cheerful readiness\nto dispose of her self-respect for half-a-crown. That is the accepted\nEnglish servant, the typical English woman (when stripped of money and\naccomplishments) as she appears in the works of contemporary writers.\nBut Delia somehow was different. I can only regret the circumstance--it\nwas altogether beyond my control.\n\n\n\n\nDOCTOR CRUMP ACTS.\n\nXLI.\n\n\nEarly the next morning the Angel went down through the village, and\nclimbing the fence, waded through the waist-high reeds that fringe the\nSidder. He was going to Bandram Bay to take a nearer view of the sea,\nwhich one could just see on a clear day from the higher parts of\nSiddermorton Park. And suddenly he came upon Crump sitting on a log and\nsmoking. (Crump always smoked exactly two ounces per week--and he always\nsmoked it in the open air.)\n\n\"Hullo!\" said Crump, in his healthiest tone. \"How's the wing?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Angel. \"The pain's gone.\"\n\n\"I suppose you know you are trespassing?\"\n\n\"Trespassing!\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I suppose you don't know what that means,\" said Crump.\n\n\"I don't,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I must congratulate you. I don't know how long you will last, but you\nare keeping it up remarkably well. I thought at first you were a\nmattoid, but you're so amazingly consistent. Your attitude of entire\nignorance of the elementary facts of Life is really a very amusing pose.\nYou make slips of course, but very few. But surely we two understand one\nanother.\"\n\nHe smiled at the Angel. \"You would beat Sherlock Holmes. I wonder who\nyou really are.\"\n\nThe Angel smiled back, with eyebrows raised and hands extended. \"It's\nimpossible for you to know who I am. Your eyes are blind, your ears\ndeaf, your soul dark, to all that is wonderful about me. It's no good my\ntelling that I fell into your world.\"\n\nThe Doctor waved his pipe. \"Not that, please. I don't want to pry if you\nhave your reasons for keeping quiet. Only I would like you to think of\nHilyer's mental health. He really believes this story.\"\n\nThe Angel shrugged his dwindling wings.\n\n\"You did not know him before this affair. He's changed tremendously. He\nused to be neat and comfortable. For the last fortnight he's been hazy,\nwith a far-away look in his eyes. He preached last Sunday without his\ncuff links, and something wrong with his tie, and he took for his text,\n'Eye hath not seen nor ear heard.' He really believes all this nonsense\nabout the Angel-land. The man is verging on monomania!\"\n\n\"You _will_ see things from your own standpoint,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Everyone must. At any rate, I think it jolly regrettable to see this\npoor old fellow hypnotized, as you certainly have hypnotized him. I\ndon't know where you come from nor who you are, but I warn you I'm not\ngoing to see the old boy made a fool of much longer.\"\n\n\"But he's not being made a fool of. He's simply beginning to dream of a\nworld outside his knowledge----\"\n\n\"It won't do,\" said Crump. \"I'm not one of the dupe class. You are\neither of two things--a lunatic at large (which I don't believe), or a\nknave. Nothing else is possible. I think I know a little of this world,\nwhatever I do of yours. Very well. If you don't leave Hilyer alone I\nshall communicate with the police, and either clap you into a prison, if\nyou go back on your story, or into a madhouse if you don't. It's\nstretching a point, but I swear I'd certify you insane to-morrow to get\nyou out of the village. It's not only the Vicar. As you know. I hope\nthat's plain. Now what have you to say?\"\n\nWith an affectation of great calm, the Doctor took out his penknife and\nbegan to dig the blade into his pipe bowl. His pipe had gone out during\nthis last speech.\n\nFor a moment neither spoke. The Angel looked about him with a face that\ngrew pale. The Doctor extracted a plug of tobacco from his pipe and\nflung it away, shut his penknife and put it in his waistcoat pocket. He\nhad not meant to speak quite so emphatically, but speech always warmed\nhim.\n\n\"Prison,\" said the Angel. \"Madhouse! Let me see.\" Then he remembered\nthe Vicar's explanation. \"Not that!\" he said. He approached Crump with\neyes dilated and hands outstretched.\n\n\"I knew _you_ would know what those things meant--at any rate. Sit\ndown,\" said Crump, indicating the tree trunk beside him by a movement of\nthe head.\n\nThe Angel, shivering, sat down on the tree trunk and stared at the\nDoctor.\n\nCrump was getting out his pouch. \"You are a strange man,\" said the\nAngel. \"Your beliefs are like--a steel trap.\"\n\n\"They are,\" said Crump--flattered.\n\n\"But I tell you--I assure you the thing is so--I know nothing, or at\nleast remember nothing of anything I knew of this world before I found\nmyself in the darkness of night on the moorland above Sidderford.\"\n\n\"Where did you learn the language then?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Only I tell you--But I haven't an atom of the sort of\nproof that would convince you.\"\n\n\"And you really,\" said Crump, suddenly coming round upon him and\nlooking into his eyes; \"You really believe you were eternally in a kind\nof glorious heaven before then?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Crump, and lit his pipe. He sat smoking, elbow on knee,\nfor some time, and the Angel sat and watched him. Then his face grew\nless troubled.\n\n\"It is just possible,\" he said to himself rather than to the Angel, and\nbegan another piece of silence.\n\n\"You see;\" he said, when that was finished. \"There is such a thing as\ndouble personality.... A man sometimes forgets who he is and thinks he\nis someone else. Leaves home, friends, and everything, and leads a\ndouble life. There was a case in _Nature_ only a month or so ago. The\nman was sometimes English and right-handed, and sometimes Welsh and\nleft-handed. When he was English he knew no Welsh, when he was Welsh he\nknew no English.... H'm.\"\n\nHe turned suddenly on the Angel and said \"Home!\" He fancied he might\nrevive in the Angel some latent memory of his lost youth. He went on\n\"Dadda, Pappa, Daddy, Mammy, Pappy, Father, Dad, Governor, Old Boy,\nMother, dear Mother, Ma, Mumsy.... No good? What are you laughing at?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the Angel. \"You surprised me a little,--that is all. A\nweek ago I should have been puzzled by that vocabulary.\"\n\nFor a minute Crump rebuked the Angel silently out of the corner of his\neye.\n\n\"You have such an ingenuous face. You almost force me to believe you.\nYou are certainly not an ordinary lunatic. Your mind--except for your\nisolation from the past--seems balanced enough. I wish Nordau or\nLombroso or some of these _Saltpetriere_ men could have a look at you.\nDown here one gets no practice worth speaking about in mental cases.\nThere's one idiot--and he's just a damned idiot of an idiot--; all the\nrest are thoroughly sane people.\"\n\n\"Possibly that accounts for their behaviour,\" said the Angel\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"But to consider your general position here,\" said Crump, ignoring his\ncomment, \"I really regard you as a bad influence here. These fancies\nare contagious. It is not simply the Vicar. There is a man named Shine\nhas caught the fad, and he has been in the drink for a week, off and on,\nand offering to fight anyone who says you are not an Angel. Then a man\nover at Sidderford is, I hear, affected with a kind of religious mania\non the same tack. These things spread. There ought to be a quarantine in\nmischievous ideas. And I have heard another story....\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\" said the Angel. \"Suppose I am (quite\nunintentionally) doing mischief....\"\n\n\"You can leave the village,\" said Crump.\n\n\"Then I shall only go into another village.\"\n\n\"That's not my affair,\" said Crump. \"Go where you like. Only go. Leave\nthese three people, the Vicar, Shine, the little servant girl, whose\nheads are all spinning with galaxies of Angels....\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Angel. \"Face your world! I tell you I can't. And leave\nDelia! I don't understand.... I do not know how to set about getting\nWork and Food and Shelter. And I am growing afraid of human beings....\"\n\n\"Fancies, fancies,\" said Crump, watching him, \"mania.\"\n\n\"It's no good my persisting in worrying you,\" he said suddenly, \"but\ncertainly the situation is impossible as it stands.\" He stood up with a\njerk.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mr--Angel,\" he said, \"the long and the short of it is--I\nsay it as the medical adviser of this parish--you are an unhealthy\ninfluence. We can't have you. You must go.\"\n\nHe turned, and went striding through the grass towards the roadway,\nleaving the Angel sitting disconsolately on the tree trunk. \"An\nunhealthy influence,\" said the Angel slowly, staring blankly in front of\nhim, and trying to realise what it meant.\n\n\n\n\nSIR JOHN GOTCH ACTS.\n\nXLII.\n\n\nSir John Gotch was a little man with scrubby hair, a small, thin nose\nsticking out of a face crackled with wrinkles, tight brown gaiters, and\na riding whip. \"I've come, you see,\" he said, as Mrs Hinijer closed the\ndoor.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Vicar, \"I'm obliged to you. I'm really obliged to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Glad to be of any service to you,\" said Sir John Gotch. (Angular\nattitude.)\n\n\"This business,\" said the Vicar, \"this unfortunate business of the\nbarbed wire--is really, you know, a most unfortunate business.\"\n\nSir John Gotch became decidedly more angular in his attitude. \"It is,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"This Mr Angel being my guest--\"\n\n\"No reason why he should cut my wire,\" said Sir John Gotch, briefly.\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"May I ask _who_ this Mr Angel is?\" asked Sir John Gotch with the\nabruptness of long premeditation.\n\nThe Vicar's fingers jumped to his chin. What _was_ the good of talking\nto a man like Sir John Gotch about Angels?\n\n\"To tell you the exact truth,\" said the Vicar, \"there is a little\nsecret--\"\n\n\"Lady Hammergallow told me as much.\"\n\nThe Vicar's face suddenly became bright red.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Sir John, with scarcely a pause, \"he's been going\nabout this village preaching Socialism?\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said the Vicar, \"_No!_\"\n\n\"He has. He has been buttonholing every yokel he came across, and asking\nthem why they had to work, while we--I and you, you know--did nothing.\nHe has been saying we ought to educate every man up to your level and\nmine--out of the rates, I suppose, as usual. He has been suggesting that\nwe--I and you, you know--keep these people down--pith 'em.\"\n\n\"_Dear_ me!\" said the Vicar, \"I had no idea.\"\n\n\"He has done this wire-cutting as a demonstration, I tell you, as a\nSocialistic demonstration. If we don't come down on him pretty sharply,\nI tell you, we shall have the palings down in Flinders Lane next, and\nthe next thing will be ricks afire, and every damned (I beg your pardon,\nVicar. I know I'm too fond of that word), every blessed pheasant's egg\nin the parish smashed. I know these--\"\n\n\"A Socialist,\" said the Vicar, quite put out, \"I had _no_ idea.\"\n\n\"You see why I am inclined to push matters against our gentleman though\nhe _is_ your guest. It seems to me he has been taking advantage of your\npaternal--\"\n\n\"Oh, _not_ paternal!\" said the Vicar. \"Really--\"\n\n\"(I beg your pardon, Vicar--it was a slip.) Of your kindness, to go\nmischief-making everywhere, setting class against class, and the poor\nman against his bread and butter.\"\n\nThe Vicar's fingers were at his chin again.\n\n\"So there's one of two things,\" said Sir John Gotch. \"Either that Guest\nof yours leaves the parish, or--I take proceedings. That's final.\"\n\nThe Vicar's mouth was all askew.\n\n\"That's the position,\" said Sir John, jumping to his feet, \"if it were\nnot for you, I should take proceedings at once. As it is--am I to take\nproceedings or no?\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the Vicar in horrible perplexity.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Arrangements have to be made.\"\n\n\"He's a mischief-making idler.... I know the breed. But I'll give you a\nweek----\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the Vicar. \"I understand your position. I perceive the\nsituation is getting intolerable....\"\n\n\"Sorry to give you this bother, of course,\" said Sir John.\n\n\"A week,\" said the Vicar.\n\n\"A week,\" said Sir John, leaving.\n\n\nThe Vicar returned, after accompanying Gotch out, and for a long time he\nremained sitting before the desk in his study, plunged in thought. \"A\nweek!\" he said, after an immense silence. \"Here is an Angel, a glorious\nAngel, who has quickened my soul to beauty and delight, who has opened\nmy eyes to Wonderland, and something more than Wonderland, ... and I\nhave promised to get rid of him in a week! What are we men made of?...\nHow _can_ I tell him?\"\n\nHe began to walk up and down the room, then he went into the\ndining-room, and stood staring blankly out at the cornfield. The table\nwas already laid for lunch. Presently he turned, still dreaming, and\nalmost mechanically helped himself to a glass of sherry.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEA CLIFF.\n\nXLIII.\n\n\nThe Angel lay upon the summit of the cliff above Bandram Bay, and stared\nout at the glittering sea. Sheer from under his elbows fell the cliff,\nfive hundred and seven feet of it down to the datum line, and the\nsea-birds eddied and soared below him. The upper part of the cliff was a\ngreenish chalky rock, the lower two-thirds a warm red, marbled with\ngypsum bands, and from half-a-dozen places spurted jets of water, to\nfall in long cascades down its face. The swell frothed white on the\nflinty beach, and the water beyond where the shadows of an outstanding\nrock lay, was green and purple in a thousand tints and marked with\nstreaks and flakes of foam. The air was full of sunlight and the\ntinkling of the little waterfalls and the slow soughing of the seas\nbelow. Now and then a butterfly flickered over the face of the cliff,\nand a multitude of sea birds perched and flew hither and thither.\n\nThe Angel lay with his crippled, shrivelled wings humped upon his back,\nwatching the gulls and jackdaws and rooks, circling in the sunlight,\nsoaring, eddying, sweeping down to the water or upward into the dazzling\nblue of the sky. Long the Angel lay there and watched them going to and\nfro on outspread wings. He watched, and as he watched them he remembered\nwith infinite longing the rivers of starlight and the sweetness of the\nland from which he came. And a gull came gliding overhead, swiftly and\neasily, with its broad wings spreading white and fair against the blue.\nAnd suddenly a shadow came into the Angel's eyes, the sunlight left\nthem, he thought of his own crippled pinions, and put his face upon his\narm and wept.\n\nA woman who was walking along the footpath across the Cliff Field saw\nonly a twisted hunchback dressed in the Vicar of Siddermorton's cast-off\nclothes, sprawling foolishly at the edge of the cliff and with his\nforehead on his arm. She looked at him and looked again. \"The silly\ncreature has gone to sleep,\" she said, and though she had a heavy basket\nto carry, came towards him with an idea of waking him up. But as she\ndrew near she saw his shoulders heave and heard the sound of his\nsobbing.\n\nShe stood still a minute, and her features twitched into a kind of grin.\nThen treading softly she turned and went back towards the pathway. \"'Tis\nso hard to think of anything to say,\" she said. \"Poor afflicted soul!\"\n\nPresently the Angel ceased sobbing, and stared with a tear-stained face\nat the beach below him.\n\n\"This world,\" he said, \"wraps me round and swallows me up. My wings grow\nshrivelled and useless. Soon I shall be nothing more than a crippled\nman, and I shall age, and bow myself to pain, and die.... I am\nmiserable. And I am alone.\"\n\nThen he rested his chin on his hands upon the edge of the cliff, and\nbegan to think of Delia's face with the light in her eyes. The Angel\nfelt a curious desire to go to her and tell her of his withered wings.\nTo place his arms about her and weep for the land he had lost. \"Delia!\"\nhe said to himself very softly. And presently a cloud drove in front of\nthe sun.\n\n\n\n\nMRS HINIJER ACTS.\n\nXLIV.\n\n\nMrs Hinijer surprised the Vicar by tapping at his study door after tea.\n\"Begging your pardon, Sir,\" said Mrs Hinijer. \"But might I make so bold\nas to speak to you for a moment?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mrs Hinijer,\" said the Vicar, little dreaming of the blow\nthat was coming. He held a letter in his hand, a very strange and\ndisagreeable letter from his bishop, a letter that irritated and\ndistressed him, criticising in the strongest language the guests he\nchose to entertain in his own house. Only a popular bishop living in a\ndemocratic age, a bishop who was still half a pedagogue, could have\nwritten such a letter.\n\nMrs Hinijer coughed behind her hand and struggled with some respiratory\ndisorganisation. The Vicar felt apprehensive. Usually in their\ninterviews he was the most disconcerted. Invariably so when the\ninterview ended.\n\n\"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"May I make so bold, sir, as to arst when Mr Angel is a-going?\" (Cough.)\n\nThe Vicar started. \"To ask when Mr Angel is going?\" he repeated slowly\nto gain time. \"_Another!_\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. But I've been used to waitin' on gentlefolks, sir; and\nyou'd hardly imagine how it feels quite to wait on such as 'im.\"\n\n\"Such as ... _'im_! Do I understand you, Mrs Hinijer, that you don't\nlike Mr Angel?\"\n\n\"You see, sir, before I came to you, sir, I was at Lord Dundoller's\nseventeen years, and you, sir--if you will excuse me--are a perfect\ngentleman yourself, sir--though in the Church. And then....\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said the Vicar. \"And don't you regard Mr Angel as a\ngentleman?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to 'ave to say it, sir.\"\n\n\"But what...? Dear me! Surely!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry to 'ave to say it, sir. But when a party goes turning\nvegetarian suddenly and putting out all the cooking, and hasn't no\nproper luggage of his own, and borry's shirts and socks from his 'ost,\nand don't know no better than to try his knife at peas (as I seed my\nvery self), and goes talking in odd corners to the housemaids, and folds\nup his napkin after meals, and eats with his fingers at minced veal, and\nplays the fiddle in the middle of the night keeping everybody awake, and\nstares and grins at his elders a-getting upstairs, and generally\nmisconducts himself with things that I can scarcely tell you all, one\ncan't help thinking, sir. Thought is free, sir, and one can't help\ncoming to one's own conclusions. Besides which, there is talk all over\nthe village about him--what with one thing and another. I know a\ngentleman when I sees a gentleman, and I know a gentleman when I don't\nsee a gentleman, and me, and Susan, and George, we've talked it over,\nbeing the upper servants, so to speak, and experienced, and leaving out\nthat girl Delia, who I only hope won't come to any harm through him, and\ndepend upon it, sir, that Mr Angel ain't what you think he is, sir, and\nthe sooner he leaves this house the better.\"\n\nMrs Hinijer ceased abruptly and stood panting but stern, and with her\neyes grimly fixed on the Vicar's face.\n\n\"_Really_, Mrs Hinijer!\" said the Vicar, and then, \"Oh _Lord_!\"\n\n\"What _have_ I done?\" said the Vicar, suddenly starting up and appealing\nto the inexorable fates. \"What HAVE I done?\"\n\n\"There's no knowing,\" said Mrs Hinijer. \"Though a deal of talk in the\nvillage.\"\n\n\"_Bother!_\" said the Vicar, going and staring out of the window. Then he\nturned. \"Look here, Mrs Hinijer! Mr Angel will be leaving this house in\nthe course of a week. Is that enough?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Mrs Hinijer. \"And I feel sure, sir....\"\n\nThe Vicar's eyes fell with unwonted eloquence upon the door.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANGEL IN TROUBLE.\n\nXLV.\n\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the Vicar, \"this is no world for Angels.\"\n\nThe blinds had not been drawn, and the twilight outer world under an\novercast sky seemed unspeakably grey and cold. The Angel sat at table in\ndejected silence. His inevitable departure had been proclaimed. Since\nhis presence hurt people and made the Vicar wretched he acquiesced in\nthe justice of the decision, but what would happen to him after his\nplunge he could not imagine. Something very disagreeable certainly.\n\n\"There is the violin,\" said the Vicar. \"Only after our experience----\"\n\n\"I must get you clothes--a general outfit.---- Dear me! you don't\nunderstand railway travelling! And coinage! Taking lodgings!\nEating-houses!---- I must come up at least and see you settled. Get work\nfor you. But an Angel in London! Working for his living! That grey cold\nwilderness of people! What _will_ become of you?---- If I had one friend\nin the world I could trust to believe me!\"\n\n\"I ought not to be sending you away----\"\n\n\"Do not trouble overmuch for me, my friend,\" said the Angel. \"At least\nthis life of yours ends. And there are things in it. There is something\nin this life of yours---- Your care for me! I thought there was nothing\nbeautiful at all in life----\"\n\n\"And I have betrayed you!\" said the Vicar, with a sudden wave of\nremorse. \"Why did I not face them all--say, 'This is the best of life'?\nWhat do these everyday things matter?\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly. \"What _do_ they matter?\" he said.\n\n\"I have only come into your life to trouble it,\" said the Angel.\n\n\"Don't say that,\" said the Vicar. \"You have come into my life to awaken\nme. I have been dreaming--dreaming. Dreaming this was necessary and\nthat. Dreaming that this narrow prison was the world. And the dream\nstill hangs about me and troubles me. That is all. Even your\ndeparture----. Am I not dreaming that you must go?\"\n\nWhen he was in bed that night the mystical aspect of the case came still\nmore forcibly before the Vicar. He lay awake and had the most horrible\nvisions of his sweet and delicate visitor drifting through this\nunsympathetic world and happening upon the cruellest misadventures. His\nguest _was_ an Angel assuredly. He tried to go over the whole story of\nthe past eight days again. He thought of the hot afternoon, the shot\nfired out of sheer surprise, the fluttering iridescent wings, the\nbeautiful saffron-robed figure upon the ground. How wonderful that had\nseemed to him! Then his mind turned to the things he had heard of the\nother world, to the dreams the violin had conjured up, to the vague,\nfluctuating, wonderful cities of the Angelic Land. He tried to recall\nthe forms of the buildings, the shapes of the fruits upon the trees, the\naspect of the winged shapes that traversed its ways. They grew from a\nmemory into a present reality, grew every moment just a little more\nvivid and his troubles a little less immediate; and so, softly and\nquietly, the Vicar slipped out of his troubles and perplexities into the\nLand of Dreams.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI.\n\n\nDelia sat with her window open, hoping to hear the Angel play. But that\nnight there was to be no playing. The sky was overcast, yet not so\nthickly but that the moon was visible. High up a broken cloud-lace drove\nacross the sky, and now the moon was a hazy patch of light, and now it\nwas darkened, and now rode clear and bright and sharply outlined against\nthe blue gulf of night. And presently she heard the door into the garden\nopening, and a figure came out under the drifting pallor of the\nmoonlight.\n\nIt was the Angel. But he wore once more the saffron robe in the place of\nhis formless overcoat. In the uncertain light this garment had only a\ncolourless shimmer, and his wings behind him seemed a leaden grey. He\nbegan taking short runs, flapping his wings and leaping, going to and\nfro amidst the drifting patches of light and the shadows of the trees.\nDelia watched him in amazement. He gave a despondent cry, leaping\nhigher. His shrivelled wings flashed and fell. A thicker patch in the\ncloud-film made everything obscure. He seemed to spring five or six feet\nfrom the ground and fall clumsily. She saw him in the dimness crouching\non the ground and then she heard him sobbing.\n\n\"He's hurt!\" said Delia, pressing her lips together hard and staring. \"I\nought to help him.\"\n\nShe hesitated, then stood up and flitted swiftly towards the door, went\nslipping quietly downstairs and out into the moonlight. The Angel still\nlay upon the lawn, and sobbed for utter wretchedness.\n\n\"Oh! what is the matter?\" said Delia, stooping over him and touching his\nhead timidly.\n\nThe Angel ceased sobbing, sat up abruptly, and stared at her. He saw her\nface, moonlit, and soft with pity. \"What is the matter?\" she whispered.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\nThe Angel stared about him, and his eyes came to rest on her face.\n\"Delia!\" he whispered.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" said Delia.\n\n\"My wings,\" said the Angel. \"I cannot use my wings.\"\n\nDelia did not understand, but she realised that it was something very\ndreadful. \"It is dark, it is cold,\" whispered the Angel; \"I cannot use\nmy wings.\"\n\nIt hurt her unaccountably to see the tears on his face. She did not know\nwhat to do.\n\n\"Pity me, Delia,\" said the Angel, suddenly extending his arms towards\nher; \"pity me.\"\n\nImpulsively she knelt down and took his face between her hands. \"I do\nnot know,\" she said; \"but I am sorry. I am sorry for you, with all my\nheart.\"\n\nThe Angel said not a word. He was looking at her little face in the\nbright moonlight, with an expression of uncomprehending wonder in his\neyes. \"This strange world!\" he said.\n\nShe suddenly withdrew her hands. A cloud drove over the moon. \"What can\nI do to help you?\" she whispered. \"I would do anything to help you.\"\n\nHe still held her at arm's length, perplexity replacing misery in his\nface. \"This strange world!\" he repeated.\n\nBoth whispered, she kneeling, he sitting, in the fluctuating moonlight\nand darkness of the lawn.\n\n\n\"Delia!\" said Mrs Hinijer, suddenly projecting from her window; \"Delia,\nis that you?\"\n\nThey both looked up at her in consternation.\n\n\"Come in at once, Delia,\" said Mrs Hinijer. \"If that Mr Angel was a\ngentleman (which he isn't), he'd feel ashamed of hisself. And you an\norphan too!\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST DAY OF THE VISIT.\n\nXLVII.\n\n\nOn the morning of the next day the Angel, after he had breakfasted, went\nout towards the moor, and Mrs Hinijer had an interview with the Vicar.\nWhat happened need not concern us now. The Vicar was visibly\ndisconcerted. \"He _must_ go,\" he said; \"certainly he must go,\" and\nstraightway he forgot the particular accusation in the general trouble.\nHe spent the morning in hazy meditation, interspersed by a spasmodic\nstudy of Skiff and Waterlow's price list, and the catalogue of the\nMedical, Scholastic, and Clerical Stores. A schedule grew slowly on a\nsheet of paper that lay on the desk before him. He cut out a\nself-measurement form from the tailoring department of the Stores and\npinned it to the study curtains. This was the kind of document he was\nmaking:\n\n\"_1 Black Melton Frock Coat, patts? \u00c2\u00a33, 10s._\n\n\"_? Trousers. 2 pairs or one._\n\n\"_1 Cheviot Tweed Suit (write for patterns. Self-meas.?)_\"\n\nThe Vicar spent some time studying a pleasing array of model gentlemen.\nThey were all very nice-looking, but he found it hard to imagine the\nAngel so transfigured. For, although six days had passed, the Angel\nremained without any suit of his own. The Vicar had vacillated between a\nproject of driving the Angel into Portbroddock and getting him measured\nfor a suit, and his absolute horror of the insinuating manners of the\ntailor he employed. He knew that tailor would demand an exhaustive\nexplanation. Besides which, one never knew when the Angel might leave.\nSo the six days had passed, and the Angel had grown steadily in the\nwisdom of this world and shrouded his brightness still in the ample\nretirement of the Vicar's newest clothes.\n\n\"_1 Soft Felt Hat, No. G. 7 (say), 8s 6d._\n\n\"_1 Silk Hat, 14s 6d. Hatbox?_\"\n\n(\"I suppose he ought to have a silk hat,\" said the Vicar; \"it's the\ncorrect thing up there. Shape No. 3 seems best suited to his style. But\nit's dreadful to think of him all alone in that great city. Everyone\nwill misunderstand him, and he will misunderstand everybody. However, I\nsuppose it _must_ be. Where was I?)\"\n\n\"_1 Toothbrush. 1 Brush and Comb. Razor?_\n\n\"_\u00c2\u00bd doz. Shirts (? measure his neck), 6s ea._\n\n\"_Socks? Pants?_\n\n\"_2 suits Pyjamas. Price? Say 15s._\n\n\"_1 doz. Collars ('The Life Guardsman'), 8s._\n\n\"_Braces. Oxon Patent Versatile, 1s 11\u00c2\u00bdd._\"\n\n(\"But how will he get them on?\" said the Vicar.)\n\n\"_1 Rubber Stamp, T. Angel, and Marking Ink in box complete, 9d._\n\n(\"Those washerwomen are certain to steal all his things.\")\n\n\"_1 Single-bladed Penknife with Corkscrew, say 1s 6d._\n\n\"_N.B.--Don't forget Cuff Links, Collar Stud, &c._\" (The Vicar loved\n\"&c.\", it gave things such a precise and business-like air.)\n\n\"_1 Leather Portmanteau (had better see these)._\"\n\nAnd so forth--meanderingly. It kept the Vicar busy until lunch time,\nthough his heart ached.\n\nThe Angel did not return to lunch. This was not so very remarkable--once\nbefore he had missed the midday meal. Yet, considering how short was the\ntime they would have together now, he might perhaps have come back.\nDoubtless he had excellent reasons, though, for his absence. The Vicar\nmade an indifferent lunch. In the afternoon he rested in his usual\nmanner, and did a little more to the list of requirements. He did not\nbegin to feel nervous about the Angel till tea-time. He waited, perhaps,\nhalf an hour before he took tea. \"Odd,\" said the Vicar, feeling still\nmore lonely as he drank his tea.\n\nAs the time for dinner crept on and no Angel appeared the Vicar's\nimagination began to trouble him. \"He will come in to dinner, surely,\"\nsaid the Vicar, caressing his chin, and beginning to fret about the\nhouse upon inconsiderable errands, as his habit was when anything\noccurred to break his routine. The sun set, a gorgeous spectacle, amidst\ntumbled masses of purple cloud. The gold and red faded into twilight;\nthe evening star gathered her robe of light together from out the\nbrightness of the sky in the West. Breaking the silence of evening that\ncrept over the outer world, a corncrake began his whirring chant. The\nVicar's face grew troubled; twice he went and stared at the darkening\nhillside, and then fretted back to the house again. Mrs Hinijer served\ndinner. \"Your dinner's ready,\" she announced for the second time, with a\nreproachful intonation. \"Yes, yes,\" said the Vicar, fussing off\nupstairs.\n\nHe came down and went into his study and lit his reading lamp, a patent\naffair with an incandescent wick, dropping the match into his\nwaste-paper basket without stopping to see if it was extinguished. Then\nhe fretted into the dining-room and began a desultory attack on the\ncooling dinner....\n\n(Dear Reader, the time is almost ripe to say farewell to this little\nVicar of ours.)\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII.\n\n\nSir John Gotch (still smarting over the business of the barbed wire) was\nriding along one of the grassy ways through the preserves by the Sidder,\nwhen he saw, strolling slowly through the trees beyond the undergrowth,\nthe one particular human being he did not want to see.\n\n\"I'm damned,\" said Sir John Gotch, with immense emphasis; \"if this isn't\naltogether too much.\"\n\nHe raised himself in the stirrups. \"Hi!\" he shouted. \"You there!\"\n\nThe Angel turned smiling.\n\n\"Get out of this wood!\" said Sir John Gotch.\n\n\"_Why?_\" said the Angel.\n\n\"I'm ------,\" said Sir John Gotch, meditating some cataclysmal\nexpletive. But he could think of nothing more than \"damned.\" \"Get out of\nthis wood,\" he said.\n\nThe Angel's smile vanished. \"Why should I get out of this wood?\" he\nsaid, and stood still.\n\nNeither spoke for a full half minute perhaps, and then Sir John Gotch\ndropped out of his saddle and stood by the horse.\n\n(Now you must remember--lest the Angelic Hosts be discredited\nhereby--that this Angel had been breathing the poisonous air of this\nStruggle for Existence of ours for more than a week. It was not only his\nwings and the brightness of his face that suffered. He had eaten and\nslept and learnt the lesson of pain--had travelled so far on the road to\nhumanity. All the length of his Visit he had been meeting more and more\nof the harshness and conflict of this world, and losing touch with the\nglorious altitudes of his own.)\n\n\"You won't go, eigh!\" said Gotch, and began to lead his horse through\nthe bushes towards the Angel. The Angel stood, all his muscles tight and\nhis nerves quivering, watching his antagonist approach.\n\n\"Get out of this wood,\" said Gotch, stopping three yards away, his face\nwhite with rage, his bridle in one hand and his riding whip in the\nother.\n\nStrange floods of emotion were running through the Angel. \"Who are\nyou,\" he said, in a low quivering voice; \"who am I--that you should\norder me out of this place? What has the World done that men like\nyou....\"\n\n\"You're the fool who cut my barbed wire,\" said Gotch, threatening, \"If\nyou want to know!\"\n\n\"_Your_ barbed wire,\" said the Angel. \"Was that your barbed wire? Are\nyou the man who put down that barbed wire? What right have you....\"\n\n\"Don't you go talking Socialist rot,\" said Gotch in short gasps. \"This\nwood's mine, and I've a right to protect it how I can. I know your kind\nof muck. Talking rot and stirring up discontent. And if you don't get\nout of it jolly sharp....\"\n\n\"_Well!_\" said the Angel, a brimming reservoir of unaccountable energy.\n\n\"Get out of this damned wood!\" said Gotch, flashing into the bully out\nof sheer alarm at the light in the Angel's face.\n\nHe made one step towards him, with the whip raised, and then something\nhappened that neither he nor the Angel properly understood. The Angel\nseemed to leap into the air, a pair of grey wings flashed out at the\nSquire, he saw a face bearing down upon him, full of the wild beauty of\npassionate anger. His riding whip was torn out of his hand. His horse\nreared behind him, pulled him over, gained his bridle and fled.\n\nThe whip cut across his face as he fell back, stung across his face\nagain as he sat on the ground. He saw the Angel, radiant with anger, in\nthe act to strike again. Gotch flung up his hands, pitched himself\nforward to save his eyes, and rolled on the ground under the pitiless\nfury of the blows that rained down upon him.\n\n\"You brute,\" cried the Angel, striking wherever he saw flesh to feel.\n\"You bestial thing of pride and lies! You who have overshadowed the\nsouls of other men. You shallow fool with your horses and dogs! To lift\nyour face against any living thing! Learn! Learn! Learn!\"\n\nGotch began screaming for help. Twice he tried to clamber to his feet,\ngot to his knees, and went headlong again under the ferocious anger of\nthe Angel. Presently he made a strange noise in his throat, and ceased\neven to writhe under his punishment.\n\nThen suddenly the Angel awakened from his wrath, and found himself\nstanding, panting and trembling, one foot on a motionless figure, under\nthe green stillness of the sunlit woods.\n\nHe stared about him, then down at his feet where, among the tangled dead\nleaves, the hair was matted with blood. The whip dropped from his hands,\nthe hot colour fled from his face. \"_Pain!_\" he said. \"Why does he lie\nso still?\"\n\nHe took his foot off Gotch's shoulder, bent down towards the prostrate\nfigure, stood listening, knelt--shook him. \"Awake!\" said the Angel. Then\nstill more softly, \"_Awake!_\"\n\nHe remained listening some minutes or more, stood up sharply, and looked\nround him at the silent trees. A feeling of profound horror descended\nupon him, wrapped him round about. With an abrupt gesture he turned.\n\"What has happened to me?\" he said, in an awe-stricken whisper.\n\nHe started back from the motionless figure. \"_Dead!_\" he said suddenly,\nand turning, panic stricken, fled headlong through the wood.\n\n\n\n\nXLIX.\n\n\nIt was some minutes after the footsteps of the Angel had died away in\nthe distance that Gotch raised himself on his hand. \"By Jove!\" he said.\n\"Crump's right.\"\n\n\"Cut at the head, too!\"\n\nHe put his hand to his face and felt the two weals running across it,\nhot and fat. \"I'll think twice before I lift my hand against a lunatic\nagain,\" said Sir John Gotch.\n\n\"He may be a person of weak intellect, but I'm damned if he hasn't a\npretty strong arm. _Phew!_ He's cut a bit clean off the top of my ear\nwith that infernal lash.\"\n\n\"That infernal horse will go galloping to the house in the approved\ndramatic style. Little Madam'll be scared out of her wits. And I ... I\nshall have to explain how it all happened. While she vivisects me with\nquestions.\n\n\"I'm a jolly good mind to have spring guns and man-traps put in this\npreserve. Confound the Law!\"\n\n\n\n\nL.\n\n\nBut the Angel, thinking that Gotch was dead, went wandering off in a\npassion of remorse and fear through the brakes and copses along the\nSidder. You can scarcely imagine how appalled he was at this last and\noverwhelming proof of his encroaching humanity. All the darkness,\npassion and pain of life seemed closing in upon him, inexorably,\nbecoming part of him, chaining him to all that a week ago he had found\nstrange and pitiful in men.\n\n\"Truly, this is no world for an Angel!\" said the Angel. \"It is a World\nof War, a World of Pain, a World of Death. Anger comes upon one ... I\nwho knew not pain and anger, stand here with blood stains on my hands. I\nhave fallen. To come into this world is to fall. One must hunger and\nthirst and be tormented with a thousand desires. One must fight for\nfoothold, be angry and strike----\"\n\nHe lifted up his hands to Heaven, the ultimate bitterness of helpless\nremorse in his face, and then flung them down with a gesture of despair.\nThe prison walls of this narrow passionate life seemed creeping in upon\nhim, certainly and steadily, to crush him presently altogether. He felt\nwhat all we poor mortals have to feel sooner or later--the pitiless\nforce of the Things that Must Be, not only without us but (where the\nreal trouble lies) within, all the inevitable tormenting of one's high\nresolves, those inevitable seasons when the better self is forgotten.\nBut with us it is a gentle descent, made by imperceptible degrees over a\nlong space of years; with him it was the horrible discovery of one short\nweek. He felt he was being crippled, caked over, blinded, stupefied in\nthe wrappings of this life, he felt as a man might feel who has taken\nsome horrible poison, and feels destruction spreading within him.\n\nHe took no account of hunger or fatigue or the flight of time. On and on\nhe went, avoiding houses and roads, turning away from the sight and\nsound of a human being in a wordless desperate argument with Fate. His\nthoughts did not flow but stood banked back in inarticulate\nremonstrance against his degradation. Chance directed his footsteps\nhomeward and, at last, after nightfall, he found himself faint and weary\nand wretched, stumbling along over the moor at the back of Siddermorton.\nHe heard the rats run and squeal in the heather, and once a noiseless\nbig bird came out of the darkness, passed, and vanished again. And he\nsaw without noticing it a dull red glow in the sky before him.\n\n\n\n\nLI.\n\n\nBut when he came over the brow of the moor, a vivid light sprang up\nbefore him and refused to be ignored. He came on down the hill and\nspeedily saw more distinctly what the glare was. It came from darting\nand trembling tongues of fire, golden and red, that shot from the\nwindows and a hole in the roof of the Vicarage. A cluster of black\nheads, all the village in fact, except the fire-brigade--who were down\nat Aylmer's Cottage trying to find the key of the machine-house--came\nout in silhouette against the blaze. There was a roaring sound, and a\nhumming of voices, and presently a furious outcry. There was a shouting\nof \"No! No!\"--\"Come back!\" and an inarticulate roar.\n\nHe began to run towards the burning house. He stumbled and almost fell,\nbut he ran on. He found black figures running about him. The flaring\nfire blew gustily this way and that, and he smelt the smell of burning.\n\n\"She went in,\" said one voice, \"she went in.\"\n\n\"The mad girl!\" said another.\n\n\"Stand back! Stand back!\" cried others.\n\nHe found himself thrusting through an excited, swaying crowd, all\nstaring at the flames, and with the red reflection in their eyes.\n\n\"Stand back!\" said a labourer, clutching him.\n\n\"What is it?\" said the Angel. \"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"There's a girl in the house, and she can't get out!\"\n\n\"Went in after a fiddle,\" said another.\n\n\"'Tas hopeless,\" he heard someone else say.\n\n\"I was standing near her. I heerd her. Says she: 'I _can_ get his\nfiddle.' I heerd her--Just like that! 'I _can_ get his fiddle.'\"\n\nFor a moment the Angel stood staring. Then in a flash he saw it all, saw\nthis grim little world of battle and cruelty, transfigured in a\nsplendour that outshone the Angelic Land, suffused suddenly and\ninsupportably glorious with the wonderful light of Love and\nSelf-Sacrifice. He gave a strange cry, and before anyone could stop\nhim, was running towards the burning building. There were cries of \"The\nHunchback! The Fowener!\"\n\nThe Vicar, whose scalded hand was being tied up, turned his head, and he\nand Crump saw the Angel, a black outline against the intense, red glare\nof the doorway. It was the sensation of the tenth of a second, yet both\nmen could not have remembered that transitory attitude more vividly had\nit been a picture they had studied for hours together. Then the Angel\nwas hidden by something massive (no one knew what) that fell,\nincandescent, across the doorway.\n\n\n\n\nLII.\n\n\nThere was a cry of \"Delia\" and no more. But suddenly the flames spurted\nout in a blinding glare that shot upward to an immense height, a\nblinding brilliance broken by a thousand flickering gleams like the\nwaving of swords. And a gust of sparks, flashing in a thousand colours,\nwhirled up and vanished. Just then, and for a moment by some strange\naccident, a rush of music, like the swell of an organ, wove into the\nroaring of the flames.\n\nThe whole village standing in black knots heard the sound, except Gaffer\nSiddons who is deaf--strange and beautiful it was, and then gone again.\nLumpy Durgan, the idiot boy from Sidderford, said it began and ended\nlike the opening and shutting of a door.\n\nBut little Hetty Penzance had a pretty fancy of two figures with wings,\nthat flashed up and vanished among the flames.\n\n(And after that it was she began to pine for the things she saw in her\ndreams, and was abstracted and strange. It grieved her mother sorely at\nthe time. She grew fragile, as though she was fading out of the world,\nand her eyes had a strange, far-away look. She talked of angels and\nrainbow colours and golden wings, and was for ever singing an unmeaning\nfragment of an air that nobody knew. Until Crump took her in hand and\ncured her with fattening dietary, syrup of hypophosphites and cod liver\noil.)\n\n\n\n\nTHE EPILOGUE.\n\n\nAnd there the story of the Wonderful Visit ends. The Epilogue is in the\nmouth of Mrs Mendham. There stand two little white crosses in the\nSiddermorton churchyard, near together, where the brambles come\nclambering over the stone wall. One is inscribed Thomas Angel and the\nother Delia Hardy, and the dates of the deaths are the same. Really\nthere is nothing beneath them but the ashes of the Vicar's stuffed\nostrich. (You will remember the Vicar had his ornithological side.) I\nnoticed them when Mrs Mendham was showing me the new De la Beche\nmonument. (Mendham has been Vicar since Hilyer died.) \"The granite came\nfrom somewhere in Scotland,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"and cost ever so much--I\nforget how much--but a wonderful lot! It's quite the talk of the\nvillage.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Cissie Mendham, \"you are stepping on a grave.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mrs Mendham, \"How heedless of me! And the cripple's\ngrave too. But really you've no idea how much this monument cost them.\"\n\n\"These two people, by the bye,\" said Mrs Mendham, \"were killed when the\nold Vicarage was burnt. It's rather a strange story. He was a curious\nperson, a hunchbacked fiddler, who came from nobody knows where, and\nimposed upon the late Vicar to a frightful extent. He played in a\npretentious way by ear, and we found out afterwards that he did not know\na note of music--not a note. He was exposed before quite a lot of\npeople. Among other things, he seems to have been 'carrying on,' as\npeople say, with one of the servants, a sly little drab.... But Mendham\nhad better tell you all about it. The man was half-witted and curiously\ndeformed. It's strange the fancies girls have.\"\n\nShe looked sharply at Cissie, and Cissie blushed to the eyes.\n\n\"She was left in the house and he rushed into the flames in an attempt\nto save her. Quite romantic--isn't it? He was rather clever with the\nfiddle in his uneducated way.\n\n\"All the poor Vicar's stuffed skins were burned at the same time. It was\nalmost all he cared for. He never really got over the blow. He came to\nstop with us--for there wasn't another house available in the village.\nBut he never seemed happy. He seemed all shaken. I never saw a man so\nchanged. I tried to stir him up, but it was no good--no good at all. He\nhad the queerest delusions about angels and that kind of thing. It made\nhim odd company at times. He would say he heard music, and stare quite\nstupidly at nothing for hours together. He got quite careless about his\ndress.... He died within a twelvemonth of the fire.\"\n\nTHE END.\n\nTURNBULL AND SPEARS, PRINTERS, EDINBURGH.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Wonderful Visit, by Herbert George Wells\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERFUL VISIT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 33913-8.txt or 33913-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/3\/9\/1\/33913\/\n\nProduced by Malcolm Farmer, Martin Pettit and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net (This\nfile was produced from images generously made available\nby The Internet Archive\/Canadian Libraries)\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":51,"split":"train"}
