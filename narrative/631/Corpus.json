Two knights discuss the distance they will have travelled that day, uphill and downhill at different speeds. The older knight obscurely explains the mathematical problem.\nCarroll's Solution: As with most of the Knots, the solution includes: a simplified restatement of the problem, a method to arrive at the solution, the solution, a discussion of readers' solutions, then readers' grades. In his discussion, Carroll relates that one reader accuses the senior knight of untruthfulness (this is rebutted by Carroll, using the knight's tone). Another reader answers the problem by extending the story (this is quoted). The poem of two readers answering the problem is also quoted.\nKnot II, Eligible Apartments. Professor Balbus, named after a hero with \"anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance\", is given a problem by students. The number of guests for a party is described in puzzling terms. He in turn creates a mathematical problem for them: two answers are required of readers.\nSolution: The mathematical problem is solved with the aid of a diagram. Those employing \"guesswork\" are given partial credit. One reader suggests the genealogical problem can be solved by \"intermarriages\", to which Carroll replies, \"Wind of the western sea, you have had a very narrow escape! Be thankful to appear in the Class-list at all!\"\nKnot III, Mad Mathesis. Overbearing aunt Mad Mathesis bets her niece that she can select a train from London that will pass more trains than her niece's does. The niece loses, but thinks she has found a solution to win, a second time.\nKnot IV, The Dead Reckoning. The two knights of Knot I, in a modern guise, are party to a dispute about the weight of passengers' bags lost overboard from a ship.\nKnot V, Oughts and Crosses. The aunt and niece from Knot III are in an art museum. Trading snipes as before, the aunt evades her niece's logical problem: The niece's preceptress had told her girls, \"The more noise you make the less jam you will have, and vice versa.\" The niece wants to know if this means that if they are silent, they will have infinite jam. Instead, her aunt responds with her own logical problem.\nKnot VI, Her Radiancy. Two travellers appear in Kgovjni, a land referenced in earlier Knots. The ruler places them in \"the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread and water\" until they resolve a logical problem.\nSolution: Two problems are posed, the first of which is resolved by word-play. Much later, after the solutions to Knot VII, Carroll returns to Knot VI, to describe the second problem in detail, and to rebut criticisms of readers (who were identified by name) that they were duped.\nKnot VII, Petty Cash. The aunt and niece encounter \"by a remarkable coincidence\" others who are travelling not only on the same train, but at the same station, on the same day, at the same hour. Lunch bills are muddled due to the aunt's reluctance in writing down numbers that could \"easily\" be memorised.\nSolution: Carroll gives a solution which \"universally\" produces an answer, then gives detailed critiques of several other approaches that only \"accidentally\" give a solution.\nKnot VIII, De Omnibus Rebus. The travellers of Knot VI are leaving Kgovjni with relief, when a mathematical problem occurs to one of them.\nKnot IX, A Serpent with Corners. The characters of Knot II, and Balbus and his two students, return to give three problems loosely connected by a narrative.\nKnot X, Chelsea Buns. Mad Mathesis and her niece return, as well as Balbus and his two students.\nSolution note: The puzzle called The Change of Day is never answered, as Carroll is \"waiting for statistics\" and is himself \"so entirely puzzled by it.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Tangled Tale, by Lewis Carroll\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Perchance\nmine host will roundly deny us all food!\"\n\n\"He will chide our tardy return,\" was the grave reply, \"and such a\nrebuke will be meet.\"\n\n\"A brave conceit!\" cried the other, with a merry laugh. \"And should we\nbid him bring us yet another course, I trow his answer will be tart!\"\n\n\"We shall but get our deserts,\" sighed the elder knight, who had never\nseen a joke in his life, and was somewhat displeased at his companion's\nuntimely levity. \"'Twill be nine of the clock,\" he added in an\nundertone, \"by the time we regain our hostelry. Full many a mile shall\nwe have plodded this day!\"\n\n\"How many? How many?\" cried the eager youth, ever athirst for knowledge.\n\nThe old man was silent.\n\n\"Tell me,\" he answered, after a moment's thought, \"what time it was when\nwe stood together on yonder peak. Not exact to the minute!\" he added\nhastily, reading a protest in the young man's face. \"An' thy guess be\nwithin one poor half-hour of the mark, 'tis all I ask of thy mother's\nson! Then will I tell thee, true to the last inch, how far we shall have\ntrudged betwixt three and nine of the clock.\"\n\nA groan was the young man's only reply; while his convulsed features and\nthe deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow, revealed\nthe abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had\nplunged him.\n\n\n\n\nKNOT II.\n\nELIGIBLE APARTMENTS.\n\n   \"Straight down the crooked lane,\n   And all round the square.\"\n\n\n\"Let's ask Balbus about it,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"All right,\" said Lambert.\n\n\"_He_ can guess it,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Rather,\" said Lambert.\n\nNo more words were needed: the two brothers understood each other\nperfectly.\n\n[Illustration: \"BALBUS WAS ASSISTING HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW TO CONVINCE THE\nDRAGON.\"]\n\nBalbus was waiting for them at the hotel: the journey down had tired\nhim, he said: so his two pupils had been the round of the place, in\nsearch of lodgings, without the old tutor who had been their inseparable\ncompanion from their childhood. They had named him after the hero of\ntheir Latin exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes of that\nversatile genius--anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than\ncompensated by their sensational brilliance. \"Balbus has overcome all\nhis enemies\" had been marked by their tutor, in the margin of the book,\n\"Successful Bravery.\" In this way he had tried to extract a moral from\nevery anecdote about Balbus--sometimes one of warning, as in \"Balbus had\nborrowed a healthy dragon,\" against which he had written \"Rashness in\nSpeculation\"--sometimes of encouragement, as in the words \"Influence of\nSympathy in United Action,\" which stood opposite to the anecdote \"Balbus\nwas assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon\"--and sometimes\nit dwindled down to a single word, such as \"Prudence,\" which was all he\ncould extract from the touching record that \"Balbus, having scorched the\ntail of the dragon, went away.\" His pupils liked the short morals best,\nas it left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this\ninstance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the\nrapidity of the hero's departure.\n\nTheir report of the state of things was discouraging. That most\nfashionable of watering-places, Little Mendip, was \"chockfull\" (as the\nboys expressed it) from end to end. But in one Square they had seen no\nless than four cards, in different houses, all announcing in flaming\ncapitals \"ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS.\" \"So there's plenty of choice, after all,\nyou see,\" said spokesman Hugh in conclusion.\n\n\"That doesn't follow from the data,\" said Balbus, as he rose from the\neasy chair, where he had been dozing over _The Little Mendip Gazette_.\n\"They may be all single rooms. However, we may as well see them. I shall\nbe glad to stretch my legs a bit.\"\n\nAn unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was\nneedless, and that this long, lank creature would have been all the\nbetter with even shorter legs: but no such thought occurred to his\nloving pupils. One on each side, they did their best to keep up with his\ngigantic strides, while Hugh repeated the sentence in their father's\nletter, just received from abroad, over which he and Lambert had been\npuzzling. \"He says a friend of his, the Governor of----_what_ was that\nname again, Lambert?\" (\"Kgovjni,\" said Lambert.) \"Well, yes. The\nGovernor of----what-you-may-call-it----wants to give a _very_ small\ndinner-party, and he means to ask his father's brother-in-law, his\nbrother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his\nbrother-in-law's father: and we're to guess how many guests there will\nbe.\"\n\nThere was an anxious pause. \"_How_ large did he say the pudding was to\nbe?\" Balbus said at last. \"Take its cubical contents, divide by the\ncubical contents of what each man can eat, and the quotient----\"\n\n\"He didn't say anything about pudding,\" said Hugh, \"--and here's the\nSquare,\" as they turned a corner and came into sight of the \"eligible\napartments.\"\n\n\"It _is_ a Square!\" was Balbus' first cry of delight, as he gazed around\nhim. \"Beautiful! Beau-ti-ful! Equilateral! _And_ rectangular!\"\n\nThe boys looked round with less enthusiasm. \"Number nine is the first\nwith a card,\" said prosaic Lambert; but Balbus would not so soon awake\nfrom his dream of beauty.\n\n\"See, boys!\" he cried. \"Twenty doors on a side! What symmetry! Each side\ndivided into twenty-one equal parts! It's delicious!\"\n\n\"Shall I knock, or ring?\" said Hugh, looking in some perplexity at a\nsquare brass plate which bore the simple inscription \"RING ALSO.\"\n\n\"Both,\" said Balbus. \"That's an Ellipsis, my boy. Did you never see an\nEllipsis before?\"\n\n\"I couldn't hardly read it,\" said Hugh, evasively. \"It's no good having\nan Ellipsis, if they don't keep it clean.\"\n\n\"Which there is _one_ room, gentlemen,\" said the smiling landlady. \"And\na sweet room too! As snug a little back-room----\"\n\n\"We will see it,\" said Balbus gloomily, as they followed her in. \"I knew\nhow it would be! One room in each house! No view, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Which indeed there _is_, gentlemen!\" the landlady indignantly\nprotested, as she drew up the blind, and indicated the back garden.\n\n\"Cabbages, I perceive,\" said Balbus. \"Well, they're green, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Which the greens at the shops,\" their hostess explained, \"are by no\nmeans dependable upon. Here you has them on the premises, _and_ of the\nbest.\"\n\n\"Does the window open?\" was always Balbus' first question in testing a\nlodging: and \"Does the chimney smoke?\" his second. Satisfied on all\npoints, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to Number\nTwenty-five.\n\nThis landlady was grave and stern. \"I've nobbut one room left,\" she\ntold them: \"and it gives on the back-gyardin.\"\n\n\"But there are cabbages?\" Balbus suggested.\n\nThe landlady visibly relented. \"There is, sir,\" she said: \"and good\nones, though I say it as shouldn't. We can't rely on the shops for\ngreens. So we grows them ourselves.\"\n\n\"A singular advantage,\" said Balbus: and, after the usual questions,\nthey went on to Fifty-two.\n\n\"And I'd gladly accommodate you all, if I could,\" was the greeting that\nmet them. \"We are but mortal,\" (\"Irrelevant!\" muttered Balbus) \"and I've\nlet all my rooms but one.\"\n\n\"Which one is a back-room, I perceive,\" said Balbus: \"and looking out\non--on cabbages, I presume?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sir!\" said their hostess. \"Whatever _other_ folks may do,\n_we_ grows our own. For the shops----\"\n\n\"An excellent arrangement!\" Balbus interrupted. \"Then one can really\ndepend on their being good. Does the window open?\"\n\nThe usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time Hugh\nadded one of his own invention--\"Does the cat scratch?\"\n\nThe landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was\nnot listening, \"I will not deceive you, gentlemen,\" she said. \"It _do_\nscratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers! It'll never do it,\" she\nrepeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some\nwritten agreement between herself and the cat, \"without you pulls its\nwhiskers!\"\n\n\"Much may be excused in a cat so treated,\" said Balbus, as they left the\nhouse and crossed to Number Seventy-three, leaving the landlady\ncurtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting\nwords, as if they were a form of blessing, \"---- not without you pulls\nits whiskers!\"\n\nAt Number Seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the\nhouse, who said \"yes'm\" in answer to all questions.\n\n\"The usual room,\" said Balbus, as they marched in: \"the usual\nback-garden, the usual cabbages. I suppose you can't get them good at\nthe shops?\"\n\n\"Yes'm,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her\nplan of growing her own cabbages is simply _admirable_!\"\n\n\"Yes'm,\" said the girl, as she showed them out.\n\n\"One day-room and three bed-rooms,\" said Balbus, as they returned to the\nhotel. \"We will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least\nwalking to do to get to it.\"\n\n\"Must we walk from door to door, and count the steps?\" said Lambert.\n\n\"No, no! Figure it out, my boys, figure it out!\" Balbus gaily exclaimed,\nas he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the\nroom.\n\n\"I say! It'll be a job!\" said Hugh.\n\n\"Rather!\" said Lambert.\n\n\n\n\nKNOT III.\n\nMAD MATHESIS.\n\n   \"I waited for the train.\"\n\n\n\"Well, they call me so because I _am_ a little mad, I suppose,\" she\nsaid, good-humouredly, in answer to Clara's cautiously-worded question\nas to how she came by so strange a nick-name. \"You see, I never do what\nsane people are expected to do now-a-days. I never wear long trains,\n(talking of trains, that's the Charing Cross Metropolitan Station--I've\nsomething to tell you about _that_), and I never play lawn-tennis. I\ncan't cook an omelette. I can't even set a broken limb! _There's_ an\nignoramus for you!\"\n\nClara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was\nstill attending a High School--an institution of which Mad Mathesis\nspoke with undisguised aversion. \"Let a woman be meek and lowly!\" she\nwould say. \"None of your High Schools for me!\" But it was vacation-time\njust now, and Clara was her guest, and Mad Mathesis was showing her the\nsights of that Eighth Wonder of the world--London.\n\n\"The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station!\" she resumed, waving her hand\ntowards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend.\n\"The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed, and the\ntrains now run round and round continuously--skirting the border of\nWales, just touching at York, and so round by the east coast back to\nLondon. The way the trains run is _most_ peculiar. The westerly ones go\nround in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage\nto start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every\nquarter-of-an-hour.\"\n\n\"They part to meet again,\" said Clara, her eyes filling with tears at\nthe romantic thought.\n\n\"No need to cry about it!\" her aunt grimly remarked. \"They don't meet on\nthe same line of rails, you know. Talking of meeting, an idea strikes\nme!\" she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness. \"Let's\ngo opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains. No need for\na chaperon--ladies' saloon, you know. You shall go whichever way you\nlike, and we'll have a bet about it!\"\n\n\"I never make bets,\" Clara said very gravely. \"Our excellent preceptress\nhas often warned us----\"\n\n\"You'd be none the worse if you did!\" Mad Mathesis interrupted. \"In\nfact, you'd be the better, I'm certain!\"\n\n\"Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns,\" said Clara.\n\"But we'll have a match, if you like. Let me choose my train,\" she added\nafter a brief mental calculation, \"and I'll engage to meet exactly half\nas many again as you do.\"\n\n\"Not if you count fair,\" Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted. \"Remember, we\nonly count the trains we meet _on the way_. You mustn't count the one\nthat starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive.\"\n\n\"That will only make the difference of _one_ train,\" said Clara, as they\nturned and entered the station. \"But I never travelled alone before.\nThere'll be no one to help me to alight. However, I don't mind. Let's\nhave a match.\"\n\nA ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her.\n\"Buy a box of cigar-lights, Miss!\" he pleaded, pulling her shawl to\nattract her attention. Clara stopped to explain.\n\n\"I never smoke cigars,\" she said in a meekly apologetic tone. \"Our\nexcellent preceptress----,\" but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on,\nand the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of\namazement.\n\nThe two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central\nplatform, Mad Mathesis prattling on as usual--Clara silent, anxiously\nreconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning\nthe match.\n\n\"Mind where you go, dear!\" cried her aunt, checking her just in time.\n\"One step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water!\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Clara said, dreamily. \"The pale, the cold, and the\nmoony----\"\n\n\"Take your places on the spring-boards!\" shouted a porter.\n\n\"What are _they_ for!\" Clara asked in a terrified whisper.\n\n\"Merely to help us into the trains.\" The elder lady spoke with the\nnonchalance of one quite used to the process. \"Very few people can get\ninto a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains\nonly stop for one second.\" At this moment the whistle was heard, and two\ntrains rushed into the station. A moment's pause, and they were gone\nagain; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been\nshot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a\nMinie bullet--while an equal number were showered out upon the\nside-platforms.\n\nThree hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the\nCharing Cross platform, and eagerly compared notes. Then Clara turned\naway with a sigh. To young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment\nis always a bitter pill. Mad Mathesis followed her, full of kindly\nsympathy.\n\n\"Try again, my love!\" she said, cheerily. \"Let us vary the experiment.\nWe will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our\ntrains meet. When we see each other, we will say 'One!' and so count on\ntill we come here again.\"\n\nClara brightened up. \"I shall win _that_,\" she exclaimed eagerly, \"if I\nmay choose my train!\"\n\nAnother shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards,\nanother living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by:\nand the travellers were off again.\n\nEach gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief\nas a signal to her friend. A rush and a roar. Two trains shot past each\nother in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with\na sigh--or rather with _two_ sighs--of relief. \"One!\" Clara murmured to\nherself. \"Won! It's a word of good omen. _This_ time, at any rate, the\nvictory will be mine!\"\n\nBut _was_ it?\n\n\n\n\nKNOT IV.\n\nTHE DEAD RECKONING.\n\n   \"I did dream of money-bags to-night.\"\n\n\nNoonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be\noppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits\nof dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they\nhad found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately\nbeen breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the\nbanditti who infested the heights. Their holiday-trip was over, and they\nwere now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between\nthe two great ports of the island they had been exploring.\n\nAlong with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated\nspeech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and\nhad returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the\nTwentieth Century.\n\nStretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella,\nthey were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board\nat the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but\nheavy sack. A large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at\nthe last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had\ngathered, and, with much unintelligible jabber, seemed to be weighing\ntheir sacks.\n\n\"More like sparrows in a tree than human talk, isn't it?\" the elder\ntourist remarked to his son, who smiled feebly, but would not exert\nhimself so far as to speak. The old man tried another listener.\n\n\"What have they got in those sacks, Captain?\" he inquired, as that great\nbeing passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck.\n\nThe Captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers--tall,\ngrave, and serenely self-satisfied.\n\n\"Fishermen,\" he explained, \"are often passengers in My ship. These five\nare from Mhruxi--the place we last touched at--and that's the way they\ncarry their money. The money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it\ncosts little, as you may guess. We buy it from them by weight--about\nfive shillings a pound. I fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those\nsacks.\"\n\nBy this time the old man had closed his eyes--in order, no doubt, to\nconcentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the Captain\nfailed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous\nmarch.\n\nMeanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine\nthat one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the\nweights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the\nform of winch-handles, belaying-pins, &c., as they could find. This\nbrought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks\nin the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and\nstrolled away.\n\nWhen next the Captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused\nhimself to speak.\n\n\"_What_ did you call the place those fellows came from, Captain?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Mhruxi, sir.\"\n\n\"And the one we are bound for?\"\n\nThe Captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of\nit nobly. \"They call it Kgovjni, sir.\"\n\n\"K--I give it up!\" the young man faintly said.\n\nHe stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the\ncompassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down,\nunluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella. It was scalding hot,\nand he decided not to drink it. The effort of making this resolution,\ncoming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was\ntoo much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence.\n\nHis father courteously tried to make amends for his _nonchalance_.\n\n\"Whereabouts are we now, Captain?\" said he, \"Have you any idea?\"\n\nThe Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman. \"I could tell\nyou _that_, sir,\" he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, \"to an\ninch!\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise.\n\n\"And mean so,\" persisted the Captain. \"Why, what do you suppose would\nbecome of My ship, if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude?\nCould _you_ make anything of My Dead Reckoning?\"\n\n\"Nobody could, I'm sure!\" the other heartily rejoined.\n\nBut he had overdone it.\n\n\"It's _perfectly_ intelligible,\" the Captain said, in an offended tone,\n\"to any one that understands such things.\" With these words he moved\naway, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist\nthe jib.\n\nOur tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of\nthem remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the\nwind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into\nthe sea.\n\nBut the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property. In a\nmoment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury,\nand pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the\ndisaster.\n\nThe old man explained it to the Captain.\n\n\"Let us make it up among us,\" he added in conclusion. \"Ten pounds will\ndo it, I think you said?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand.\n\n\"No, sir!\" he said, in his grandest manner. \"You will excuse Me, I am\nsure; but these are My passengers. The accident has happened on board My\nship, and under My orders. It is for Me to make compensation.\" He\nturned to the angry fishermen. \"Come here, my men!\" he said, in the\nMhruxian dialect. \"Tell me the weight of each sack. I saw you weighing\nthem just now.\"\n\nThen ensued a perfect Babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all\nscreaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and\nthey had done what they could with whatever came handy.\n\nTwo iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four\nwinch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the\nCaptain superintending and noting the results. But the matter did not\nseem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which\nthe sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the Captain\napproached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to\nconceal under a laugh.\n\n\"It's an absurd difficulty,\" he said. \"Perhaps one of you gentlemen can\nsuggest something. It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time!\"\n\n\"If they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value\nthem separately,\" the youth hastily decided.\n\n\"Let's hear all about it,\" was the old man's more cautious remark.\n\n\"They _did_ have five separate weighings,\" the Captain said, \"but--Well,\nit beats _me_ entirely!\" he added, in a sudden burst of candour. \"Here's\nthe result. First and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and\nthird, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth\nand fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left,\nand it took _three_ sacks to weigh it down--that's the first, third and\nfifth--and _they_ weighed sixteen pounds. There, gentlemen! Did you ever\nhear anything like _that_?\"\n\nThe old man muttered under his breath \"If only my sister were here!\" and\nlooked helplessly at his son. His son looked at the five natives. The\nfive natives looked at the Captain. The Captain looked at nobody: his\neyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself\n\"Contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. _I_\ncontemplate _Myself_!\"\n\n\n\n\nKNOT V.\n\nOUGHTS AND CROSSES.\n\n   \"Look here, upon this picture, and on this.\"\n\n\n\"And what made you choose the first train, Goosey?\" said Mad Mathesis,\nas they got into the cab. \"Couldn't you count better than _that_?\"\n\n\"I took an extreme case,\" was the tearful reply. \"Our excellent\npreceptress always says 'When in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case.'\nAnd I _was_ in doubt.\"\n\n\"Does it always succeed?\" her aunt enquired.\n\nClara sighed. \"Not _always_,\" she reluctantly admitted. \"And I can't\nmake out why. One day she was telling the little girls--they make such a\nnoise at tea, you know--'The more noise you make, the less jam you will\nhave, and _vice vers\u00c3\u00a2_.' And I thought they wouldn't know what '_vice\nvers\u00c3\u00a2_' meant: so I explained it to them. I said 'If you make an\ninfinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get\nan infinite lot of jam.' But our excellent preceptress said that wasn't\na good instance. _Why_ wasn't it?\" she added plaintively.\n\nHer aunt evaded the question. \"One sees certain objections to it,\" she\nsaid. \"But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains? None of\nthem go infinitely fast, I believe.\"\n\n\"I called them hares and tortoises,\" Clara said--a little timidly, for\nshe dreaded being laughed at. \"And I thought there couldn't be so many\nhares as tortoises on the Line: so I took an extreme case--one hare and\nan infinite number of tortoises.\"\n\n\"An extreme case, indeed,\" her aunt remarked with admirable gravity:\n\"and a most dangerous state of things!\"\n\n\"And I thought, if I went with a tortoise, there would be only _one_\nhare to meet: but if I went with the hare--you know there were _crowds_\nof tortoises!\"\n\n\"It wasn't a bad idea,\" said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at\nthe entrance of Burlington House. \"You shall have another chance to-day.\nWe'll have a match in marking pictures.\"\n\nClara brightened up. \"I should like to try again, very much,\" she said.\n\"I'll take more care this time. How are we to play?\"\n\nTo this question Mad Mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines\ndown the margins of the catalogue. \"See,\" she said after a minute, \"I've\ndrawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room,\nand I want you to fill them with oughts and crosses--crosses for good\nmarks and oughts for bad. The first column is for choice of subject, the\nsecond for arrangement, the third for colouring. And these are the\nconditions of the match. You must give three crosses to two or three\npictures. You must give two crosses to four or five----\"\n\n\"Do you mean _only_ two crosses?\" said Clara. \"Or may I count the\nthree-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures?\"\n\n\"Of course you may,\" said her aunt. \"Any one, that has _three_ eyes, may\nbe said to have _two_ eyes, I suppose?\"\n\nClara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery,\nhalf-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight.\n\n\"And you must give one cross to nine or ten.\"\n\n\"And which wins the match?\" Clara asked, as she carefully entered these\nconditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue.\n\n\"Whichever marks fewest pictures.\"\n\n\"But suppose we marked the same number?\"\n\n\"Then whichever uses most marks.\"\n\nClara considered. \"I don't think it's much of a match,\" she said. \"I\nshall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two\ncrosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest.\"\n\n\"Will you, indeed?\" said her aunt. \"Wait till you've heard all the\nconditions, my impetuous child. You must give three oughts to one or two\npictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine. I\ndon't want you to be _too_ hard on the R.A.'s.\"\n\nClara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions. \"It's a\ngreat deal worse than Circulating Decimals!\" she said. \"But I'm\ndetermined to win, all the same!\"\n\nHer aunt smiled grimly. \"We can begin _here_,\" she said, as they paused\nbefore a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the\n\"Portrait of Lieutenant Brown, mounted on his favorite elephant.\"\n\n\"He looks awfully conceited!\" said Clara. \"I don't think he was the\nelephant's favorite Lieutenant. What a hideous picture it is! And it\ntakes up room enough for twenty!\"\n\n\"Mind what you say, my dear!\" her aunt interposed. \"It's by an R.A.!\"\n\nBut Clara was quite reckless. \"I don't care who it's by!\" she cried.\n\"And I shall give it three bad marks!\"\n\nAunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd, and for\nthe next half-hour Clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing\nthem out again, and hunting up and down for suitable pictures. This she\nfound the hardest part of all. \"I _can't_ find the one I want!\" she\nexclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation.\n\n\"What is it you want to find, my dear?\" The voice was strange to Clara,\nbut so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it, even\nbefore she had seen her; and when she turned, and met the smiling looks\nof two little old ladies, whose round dimpled faces, exactly alike,\nseemed never to have known a care, it was as much as she could do--as\nshe confessed to Aunt Mattie afterwards--to keep herself from hugging\nthem both.\n\n\"I was looking for a picture,\" she said, \"that has a good subject--and\nthat's well arranged--but badly coloured.\"\n\nThe little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm. \"Calm\nyourself, my dear,\" said the one who had spoken first, \"and try to\nremember which it was. What _was_ the subject?\"\n\n\"Was it an elephant, for instance?\" the other sister suggested. They\nwere still in sight of Lieutenant Brown.\n\n\"I don't know, indeed!\" Clara impetuously replied. \"You know it doesn't\nmatter a bit what the subject _is_, so long as it's a good one!\"\n\nOnce more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm, and one of them\nwhispered something to the other, of which Clara caught only the one\nword \"mad.\"\n\n\"They mean Aunt Mattie, of course,\" she said to herself--fancying, in\nher innocence, that London was like her native town, where everybody\nknew everybody else. \"If you mean my aunt,\" she added aloud, \"she's\n_there_--just three pictures beyond Lieutenant Brown.\"\n\n\"Ah, well! Then you'd better go to her, my dear!\" her new friend said,\nsoothingly. \"_She'll_ find you the picture you want. Good-bye, dear!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, dear!\" echoed the other sister, \"Mind you don't lose sight of\nyour aunt!\" And the pair trotted off into another room, leaving Clara\nrather perplexed at their manner.\n\n\"They're real darlings!\" she soliloquised. \"I wonder why they pity me\nso!\" And she wandered on, murmuring to herself \"It must have two good\nmarks, and----\"\n\n\n\n\nKNOT VI.\n\nHER RADIANCY.\n\n   \"One piecee thing that my have got,\n     Maskee[A] that thing my no can do.\n   You talkee you no sabey what?\n               Bamboo.\"\n\n\nThey landed, and were at once conducted to the Palace. About half way\nthey were met by the Governor, who welcomed them in English--a great\nrelief to our travellers, whose guide could speak nothing but Kgovjnian.\n\n\"I don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by!\" the old man\nwhispered to his son. \"And why do they say 'Bamboo!' so often?\"\n\n\"It alludes to a local custom,\" replied the Governor, who had overheard\nthe question. \"Such persons as happen in any way to displease Her\nRadiancy are usually beaten with rods.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"WHY DO THEY SAY 'BAMBOO!' SO OFTEN?\"]\n\nThe old man shuddered. \"A most objectional local custom!\" he remarked\nwith strong emphasis. \"I wish we had never landed! Did you notice that\nblack fellow, Norman, opening his great mouth at us? I verily believe he\nwould like to eat us!\"\n\nNorman appealed to the Governor, who was walking at his other side. \"Do\nthey often eat distinguished strangers here?\" he said, in as indifferent\na tone as he could assume.\n\n\"Not often--not ever!\" was the welcome reply. \"They are not good for it.\nPigs we eat, for they are fat. This old man is thin.\"\n\n\"And thankful to be so!\" muttered the elder traveller. \"Beaten we shall\nbe without a doubt. It's a comfort to know it won't be Beaten without\nthe B! My dear boy, just look at the peacocks!\"\n\nThey were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous\nbirds, each held in check, by means of a golden collar and chain, by a\nblack slave, who stood well behind, so as not to interrupt the view of\nthe glittering tail, with its network of rustling feathers and its\nhundred eyes.\n\nThe Governor smiled proudly. \"In your honour,\" he said, \"Her Radiancy\nhas ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks. She will, no doubt,\ndecorate you, before you go, with the usual Star and Feathers.\"\n\n\"It'll be Star without the S!\" faltered one of his hearers.\n\n\"Come, come! Don't lose heart!\" said the other. \"All this is full of\ncharm for me.\"\n\n\"You are young, Norman,\" sighed his father; \"young and light-hearted.\nFor me, it is Charm without the C.\"\n\n\"The old one is sad,\" the Governor remarked with some anxiety. \"He has,\nwithout doubt, effected some fearful crime?\"\n\n\"But I haven't!\" the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed. \"Tell him I\nhaven't, Norman!\"\n\n\"He has not, as yet,\" Norman gently explained. And the Governor\nrepeated, in a satisfied tone, \"Not as yet.\"\n\n\"Yours is a wondrous country!\" the Governor resumed, after a pause. \"Now\nhere is a letter from a friend of mine, a merchant, in London. He and\nhis brother went there a year ago, with a thousand pounds apiece; and on\nNew-Year's-day they had sixty thousand pounds between them!\"\n\n\"How did they do it?\" Norman eagerly exclaimed. Even the elder traveller\nlooked excited.\n\nThe Governor handed him the open letter. \"Anybody can do it, when once\nthey know how,\" so ran this oracular document. \"We borrowed nought: we\nstole nought. We began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece: and\nlast New-Year's-day we had sixty thousand pounds between us--sixty\nthousand golden sovereigns!\"\n\nNorman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter. His\nfather hazarded one guess. \"Was it by gambling?\"\n\n\"A Kgovjnian never gambles,\" said the Governor gravely, as he ushered\nthem through the palace gates. They followed him in silence down a long\npassage, and soon found themselves in a lofty hall, lined entirely with\npeacocks' feathers. In the centre was a pile of crimson cushions, which\nalmost concealed the figure of Her Radiancy--a plump little damsel, in a\nrobe of green satin dotted with silver stars, whose pale round face lit\nup for a moment with a half-smile as the travellers bowed before her,\nand then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll, while she\nlanguidly murmured a word or two in the Kgovjnian dialect.\n\nThe Governor interpreted. \"Her Radiancy welcomes you. She notes the\nImpenetrable Placidity of the old one, and the Imperceptible Acuteness\nof the youth.\"\n\nHere the little potentate clapped her hands, and a troop of slaves\ninstantly appeared, carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats, which they\noffered to the guests, who had, at a signal from the Governor, seated\nthemselves on the carpet.\n\n\"Sugar-plums!\" muttered the old man. \"One might as well be at a\nconfectioner's! Ask for a penny bun, Norman!\"\n\n\"Not so loud!\" his son whispered. \"Say something complimentary!\" For the\nGovernor was evidently expecting a speech.\n\n\"We thank Her Exalted Potency,\" the old man timidly began. \"We bask in\nthe light of her smile, which----\"\n\n\"The words of old men are weak!\" the Governor interrupted angrily. \"Let\nthe youth speak!\"\n\n\"Tell her,\" cried Norman, in a wild burst of eloquence, \"that, like two\ngrasshoppers in a volcano, we are shrivelled up in the presence of Her\nSpangled Vehemence!\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said the Governor, and translated this into Kgovjnian. \"I\nam now to tell you,\" he proceeded, \"what Her Radiancy requires of you\nbefore you go. The yearly competition for the post of Imperial\nScarf-maker is just ended; you are the judges. You will take account of\nthe rate of work, the lightness of the scarves, and their warmth.\nUsually the competitors differ in one point only. Thus, last year, Fifi\nand Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial-week, and they\nwere equally light; but Fifi's were twice as warm as Gogo's and she was\npronounced twice as good. But this year, woe is me, who can judge it?\nThree competitors are here, and they differ in all points! While you\nsettle their claims, you shall be lodged, Her Radiancy bids me say, free\nof expense--in the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread\nand water.\"\n\nThe old man groaned. \"All is lost!\" he wildly exclaimed. But Norman\nheeded him not: he had taken out his note-book, and was calmly jotting\ndown the particulars.\n\n\"Three they be,\" the Governor proceeded, \"Lolo, Mimi, and Zuzu. Lolo\nmakes 5 scarves while Mimi makes 2; but Zuzu makes 4 while Lolo makes 3!\nAgain, so fairylike is Zuzu's handiwork, 5 of her scarves weigh no more\nthan one of Lolo's; yet Mimi's is lighter still--5 of hers will but\nbalance 3 of Zuzu's! And for warmth one of Mimi's is equal to 4 of\nZuzu's; yet one of Lolo's is as warm as 3 of Mimi's!\"\n\nHere the little lady once more clapped her hands.\n\n\"It is our signal of dismissal!\" the Governor hastily said. \"Pay Her\nRadiancy your farewell compliments--and walk out backwards.\"\n\nThe walking part was all the elder tourist could manage. Norman simply\nsaid \"Tell Her Radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of Her Serene\nBrilliance, and bid an agonized farewell to her Condensed Milkiness!\"\n\n\"Her Radiancy is pleased,\" the Governor reported, after duly translating\nthis. \"She casts on you a glance from Her Imperial Eyes, and is\nconfident that you will catch it!\"\n\n\"That I warrant we shall!\" the elder traveller moaned to himself\ndistractedly.\n\nOnce more they bowed low, and then followed the Governor down a winding\nstaircase to the Imperial Dungeon, which they found to be lined with\ncoloured marble, lighted from the roof, and splendidly though not\nluxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite. \"I trust you\nwill not delay the calculation,\" the Governor said, ushering them in\nwith much ceremony. \"I have known great inconvenience--great and serious\ninconvenience--result to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute\nthe commands of Her Radiancy! And on this occasion she is resolute: she\nsays the thing must and shall be done: and she has ordered up ten\nthousand additional bamboos!\" With these words he left them, and they\nheard him lock and bar the door on the outside.\n\n\"I told you how it would end!\" moaned the elder traveller, wringing his\nhands, and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed\nthe expedition, and had never predicted anything of the sort. \"Oh that\nwe were well out of this miserable business!\"\n\n\"Courage!\" cried the younger cheerily. \"_H\u00c3\u00a6c olim meminisse juvabit!_\nThe end of all this will be glory!\"\n\n\"Glory without the L!\" was all the poor old man could say, as he rocked\nhimself to and fro on the malachite bench. \"Glory without the L!\"\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[Footnote A: \"_Maskee_,\" in Pigeon-English, means \"_without_.\"]\n\n\n\n\nKNOT VII.\n\nPETTY CASH.\n\n   \"Base is the slave that pays.\"\n\n\n\"Aunt Mattie!\"\n\n\"My child?\"\n\n\"_Would_ you mind writing it down at once? I shall be quite _certain_ to\nforget it if you don't!\"\n\n\"My dear, we really must wait till the cab stops. How can I possibly\nwrite anything in the midst of all this jolting?\"\n\n\"But _really_ I shall be forgetting it!\"\n\nClara's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to\nresist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and\nprepared to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the\nconfectioner's shop. Her expenditure was always made out of her aunt's\npurse, but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, that sooner or\nlater \"Mad Mathesis\" would expect an exact account of every penny that\nhad gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old\nlady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed\n\"PETTY CASH.\"\n\n\"Here's the place,\" she said at last, \"and here we have yesterday's\nluncheon duly entered. _One glass lemonade_ (Why can't you drink water,\nlike me?) _three sandwiches_ (They never put in half mustard enough. I\ntold the young woman so, to her face; and she tossed her head--like her\nimpudence!) _and seven biscuits_. _Total one-and-two-pence._ Well, now\nfor to-day's?\"\n\n\"One glass of lemonade----\" Clara was beginning to say, when suddenly\nthe cab drew up, and a courteous railway-porter was handing out the\nbewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence.\n\nHer aunt pocketed the tablets instantly. \"Business first,\" she said:\n\"petty cash--which is a form of pleasure, whatever _you_ may\nthink--afterwards.\" And she proceeded to pay the driver, and to give\nvoluminous orders about the luggage, quite deaf to the entreaties of her\nunhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account.\n\n\"My dear, you really must cultivate a more capacious mind!\" was all the\nconsolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl. \"Are not the tablets of\nyour memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon?\"\n\n\"Not wide enough! Not half wide enough!\" was the passionate reply.\n\nThe words came in aptly enough, but the voice was not that of Clara, and\nboth ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so\nsuddenly struck into their conversation. A fat little old lady was\nstanding at the door of a cab, helping the driver to extricate what\nseemed an exact duplicate of herself: it would have been no easy task to\ndecide which was the fatter, or which looked the more good-humoured of\nthe two sisters.\n\n\"I tell you the cab-door isn't half wide enough!\" she repeated, as her\nsister finally emerged, somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a\npop-gun, and she turned to appeal to Clara. \"Is it, dear?\" she said,\ntrying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with\nsmiles.\n\n\"Some folks is too wide for 'em,\" growled the cab-driver.\n\n[Illustration: \"I TELL YOU THE CAB-DOOR ISN'T HALF WIDE ENOUGH!\"]\n\n\"Don't provoke me, man!\" cried the little old lady, in what she meant\nfor a tempest of fury. \"Say another word and I'll put you into the\nCounty Court, and sue you for a _Habeas Corpus_!\" The cabman touched his\nhat, and marched off, grinning.\n\n\"Nothing like a little Law to cow the ruffians, my dear!\" she remarked\nconfidentially to Clara. \"You saw how he quailed when I mentioned the\n_Habeas Corpus_? Not that I've any idea what it means, but it sounds\nvery grand, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It's very provoking,\" Clara replied, a little vaguely.\n\n\"Very!\" the little old lady eagerly repeated. \"And we're very much\nprovoked indeed. Aren't we, sister?\"\n\n\"I never was so provoked in all my life!\" the fatter sister assented,\nradiantly.\n\nBy this time Clara had recognised her picture-gallery acquaintances,\nand, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences. \"I\nmet them first in the Royal Academy--and they were very kind to me--and\nthey were lunching at the next table to us, just now, you know--and they\ntried to help me to find the picture I wanted--and I'm sure they're dear\nold things!\"\n\n\"Friends of yours, are they?\" said Mad Mathesis. \"Well, I like their\nlooks. You can be civil to them, while I get the tickets. But do try and\narrange your ideas a little more chronologically!\"\n\nAnd so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side\nby side on the same bench waiting for the train, and chatting as if they\nhad known one another for years.\n\n\"Now this I call quite a remarkable coincidence!\" exclaimed the smaller\nand more talkative of the two sisters--the one whose legal knowledge had\nannihilated the cab-driver. \"Not only that we should be waiting for the\nsame train, and at the same station--_that_ would be curious enough--but\nactually on the same day, and the same hour of the day! That's what\nstrikes _me_ so forcibly!\" She glanced at the fatter and more silent\nsister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family\nopinion, and who meekly responded--\n\n\"And me too, sister!\"\n\n\"Those are not _independent_ coincidences----\" Mad Mathesis was just\nbeginning, when Clara ventured to interpose.\n\n\"There's no jolting here,\" she pleaded meekly. \"_Would_ you mind writing\nit down now?\"\n\nOut came the ivory tablets once more. \"What was it, then?\" said her\naunt.\n\n\"One glass of lemonade, one sandwich, one biscuit--Oh dear me!\" cried\npoor Clara, the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony.\n\n\"Toothache?\" said her aunt calmly, as she wrote down the items. The two\nsisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different\nremedies for neuralgia, each marked \"unequalled.\"\n\n\"It isn't that!\" said poor Clara. \"Thank you very much. It's only that I\n_can't_ remember how much I paid!\"\n\n\"Well, try and make it out, then,\" said her aunt. \"You've got\nyesterday's luncheon to help you, you know. And here's the luncheon we\nhad the day before--the first day we went to that shop--_one\nglass lemonade_, _four sandwiches_, _ten biscuits_. _Total,\none-and-fivepence._\" She handed the tablets to Clara, who gazed at them\nwith eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she\nwas holding them upside down.\n\nThe two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest\ninterest, and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on\nClara's arm.\n\n\"Do you know, my dear,\" she said coaxingly, \"my sister and I are in the\nvery same predicament! Quite identically the very same predicament!\nAren't we, sister?\"\n\n\"Quite identically and absolutely the very----\" began the fatter sister,\nbut she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the\nlittle one would not wait for her to finish it.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" she resumed; \"we were lunching at the very same shop as\nyou were--and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and\nfive biscuits--and neither of us has the least idea what we paid. Have\nwe, sister?\"\n\n\"Quite identically and absolutely----\" murmured the other, who evidently\nconsidered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears, and that she\nought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh\nliabilities; but the little lady broke in again, and she retired from\nthe conversation a bankrupt.\n\n\"_Would_ you make it out for us, my dear?\" pleaded the little old lady.\n\n\"You can do Arithmetic, I trust?\" her aunt said, a little anxiously, as\nClara turned from one tablet to another, vainly trying to collect her\nthoughts. Her mind was a blank, and all human expression was rapidly\nfading out of her face.\n\nA gloomy silence ensued.\n\n\n\n\nKNOT VIII.\n\nDE OMNIBUS REBUS.\n\n   \"This little pig went to market:\n   This little pig staid at home.\"\n\n\n\"By Her Radiancy's express command,\" said the Governor, as he conducted\nthe travellers, for the last time, from the Imperial presence, \"I shall\nnow have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the\nMilitary Quarter, where the agony of parting--if indeed Nature can\nsurvive the shock--must be endured! From that gate grurmstipths start\nevery quarter of an hour, both ways----\"\n\n\"Would you mind repeating that word?\" said Norman. \"Grurm----?\"\n\n\"Grurmstipths,\" the Governor repeated. \"You call them omnibuses in\nEngland. They run both ways, and you can travel by one of them all the\nway down to the harbour.\"\n\nThe old man breathed a sigh of relief; four hours of courtly ceremony\nhad wearied him, and he had been in constant terror lest something\nshould call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos.\n\nIn another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle, paved with\nmarble, and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner. Soldiers,\ncarrying pigs, were marching in all directions: and in the middle stood\na gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder, which made\nitself heard above all the uproar of the pigs.\n\n\"It is the Commander-in-Chief!\" the Governor hurriedly whispered to his\ncompanions, who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves\nbefore the great man. The Commander gravely bowed in return. He was\ncovered with gold lace from head to foot: his face wore an expression of\ndeep misery: and he had a little black pig under each arm. Still the\ngallant fellow did his best, in the midst of the orders he was every\nmoment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing\nguests.\n\n\"Farewell, oh old one--carry these three to the South corner--and\nfarewell to thee, thou young one--put this fat one on the top of the\nothers in the Western sty--may your shadows never be less--woe is me, it\nis wrongly done! Empty out all the sties, and begin again!\" And the\nsoldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a tear.\n\n\"He is in distress,\" the Governor explained as they left the court. \"Her\nRadiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four\nsties, so that, as she goes round the court, she may always find the\nnumber in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last.\"\n\n\"Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is?\" said Norman.\n\n\"Surely,\" said the Governor. \"Her Radiancy would admit that ten is\nnearer to ten than nine is--and also nearer than eleven is.\"\n\n\"Then I think it can be done,\" said Norman.\n\nThe Governor shook his head. \"The Commander has been transferring them\nin vain for four months,\" he said. \"What hope remains? And Her Radiancy\nhas ordered up ten thousand additional----\"\n\n\"The pigs don't seem to enjoy being transferred,\" the old man hastily\ninterrupted. He did not like the subject of bamboos.\n\n\"They are only _provisionally_ transferred, you know,\" said the\nGovernor. \"In most cases they are immediately carried back again: so\nthey need not mind it. And all is done with the greatest care, under the\npersonal superintendence of the Commander-in-Chief.\"\n\n\"Of course she would only go _once_ round?\" said Norman.\n\n\"Alas, no!\" sighed their conductor. \"Round and round. Round and round.\nThese are Her Radiancy's own words. But oh, agony! Here is the outer\ngate, and we must part!\" He sobbed as he shook hands with them, and the\nnext moment was briskly walking away.\n\n\"He _might_ have waited to see us off!\" said the old man, piteously.\n\n\"And he needn't have begun whistling the very _moment_ he left us!\" said\nthe young one, severely. \"But look sharp--here are two what's-his-names\nin the act of starting!\"\n\nUnluckily, the sea-bound omnibus was full. \"Never mind!\" said Norman,\ncheerily. \"We'll walk on till the next one overtakes us.\"\n\nThey trudged on in silence, both thinking over the military problem,\ntill they met an omnibus coming from the sea. The elder traveller took\nout his watch. \"Just twelve minutes and a half since we started,\" he\nremarked in an absent manner. Suddenly the vacant face brightened; the\nold man had an idea. \"My boy!\" he shouted, bringing his hand down upon\nNorman's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of\ngravity beyond the base of support.\n\nThus taken off his guard, the young man wildly staggered forwards, and\nseemed about to plunge into space: but in another moment he had\ngracefully recovered himself. \"Problem in Precession and Nutation,\" he\nremarked--in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a\nshade of annoyance. \"What is it?\" he hastily added, fearing his father\nmight have been taken ill. \"Will you have some brandy?\"\n\n\"When will the next omnibus overtake us? When? When?\" the old man cried,\ngrowing more excited every moment.\n\nNorman looked gloomy. \"Give me time,\" he said. \"I must think it over.\"\nAnd once more the travellers passed on in silence--a silence only broken\nby the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs, who were still\nbeing provisionally transferred from sty to sty, under the personal\nsuperintendence of the Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\n\n\nKNOT IX.\n\nA SERPENT WITH CORNERS.\n\n   \"Water, water, every where,\n   Nor any drop to drink.\"\n\n\n\"It'll just take one more pebble.\"\n\n\"What ever _are_ you doing with those buckets?\"\n\nThe speakers were Hugh and Lambert. Place, the beach of Little Mendip.\nTime, 1.30, P.M. Hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger,\nand trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking. Lambert was\nlying on his back, doing nothing.\n\nFor the next minute or two Hugh was silent, evidently deep in thought.\nSuddenly he started. \"I say, look here, Lambert!\" he cried.\n\n\"If it's alive, and slimy, and with legs, I don't care to,\" said\nLambert.\n\n\"Didn't Balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid,\nit displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk?\" said Hugh.\n\n\"He said things of that sort,\" Lambert vaguely replied.\n\n\"Well, just look here a minute. Here's the little bucket almost quite\nimmersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk.\nAnd now just look at it!\" He took out the little bucket as he spoke, and\nhanded the big one to Lambert. \"Why, there's hardly a teacupful! Do you\nmean to say _that_ water is the same bulk as the little bucket?\"\n\n\"Course it is,\" said Lambert.\n\n\"Well, look here again!\" cried Hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the\nwater from the big bucket into the little one. \"Why, it doesn't half\nfill it!\"\n\n\"That's _its_ business,\" said Lambert. \"If Balbus says it's the same\nbulk, why, it _is_ the same bulk, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't believe it,\" said Hugh.\n\n\"You needn't,\" said Lambert. \"Besides, it's dinner-time. Come along.\"\n\nThey found Balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him Hugh at once\npropounded his difficulty.\n\n\"Let's get you helped first,\" said Balbus, briskly cutting away at the\njoint. \"You know the old proverb 'Mutton first, mechanics afterwards'?\"\n\nThe boys did _not_ know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect\ngood faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling,\nthat came from so infallible an authority as their tutor. They ate on\nsteadily in silence, and, when dinner was over, Hugh set out the usual\narray of pens, ink, and paper, while Balbus repeated to them the problem\nhe had prepared for their afternoon's task.\n\n\"A friend of mine has a flower-garden--a very pretty one, though no\ngreat size--\"\n\n\"How big is it?\" said Hugh.\n\n\"That's what _you_ have to find out!\" Balbus gaily replied. \"All _I_\ntell you is that it is oblong in shape--just half a yard longer than its\nwidth--and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and\nruns all round it.\"\n\n\"Joining into itself?\" said Hugh.\n\n\"_Not_ joining into itself, young man. Just before doing _that_, it\nturns a corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first\nportion, and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap\ntouching the last one, till it has used up the whole of the area.\"\n\n\"Like a serpent with corners?\" said Lambert.\n\n\"Exactly so. And if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch,\nkeeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a\nfurlong. Now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden,\nI'll see if I can think out that sea-water puzzle.\"\n\n\"You said it was a flower-garden?\" Hugh inquired, as Balbus was leaving\nthe room.\n\n\"I did,\" said Balbus.\n\n\"Where do the flowers grow?\" said Hugh. But Balbus thought it best not\nto hear the question. He left the boys to their problem, and, in the\nsilence of his own room, set himself to unravel Hugh's mechanical\nparadox.\n\n\"To fix our thoughts,\" he murmured to himself, as, with hands\ndeep-buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, \"we will take\na cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and\nfill it with water up to the 10-inch mark: and we will assume that every\ninch depth of jar contains a pint of water. We will now take a solid\ncylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to _half_ a pint\nof water, and plunge 4 inches of it into the water, so that the end of\nthe cylinder comes down to the 6-inch mark. Well, that displaces 2\npints of water. What becomes of them? Why, if there were no more\ncylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to\nthe 12-inch mark. But unfortunately there _is_ more cylinder, occupying\nhalf the space between the 10-inch and the 12-inch marks, so that only\n_one_ pint of water can be accommodated there. What becomes of the other\npint? Why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and\nfill the jar up to the 13-inch mark. But unfortunately----Shade of\nNewton!\" he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror. \"When _does_ the\nwater stop rising?\"\n\nA bright idea struck him. \"I'll write a little essay on it,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Balbus's Essay._\n\n\"When a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it\ndisplaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the\nlevel of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of\nliquid had been added to it, equal in bulk to the solid. Lardner says,\nprecisely the same process occurs when a solid is _partially_ immersed:\nthe quantity of liquid displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of\nthe solid which is immersed, and the rise of the level being in\nproportion.\n\n\"Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially\nimmersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the\nliquid rises. But, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid\nis of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second\nportion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level. Again, this\nsecond rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence\nanother displacement of liquid and another rise. It is self-evident that\nthis process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that\nthe liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which,\nbeing connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it.\nIf you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water,\nand wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed. The question as\nto the source from which the water is supplied--which belongs to a high\nbranch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope--does\nnot apply to the sea. Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a\nman standing at the edge of the sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his\nhand, which he partially immerses: he remains steadfast and unmoved, and\nwe all know that he must be drowned. The multitudes who daily perish in\nthis manner to attest a philosophical truth, and whose bodies the\nunreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores, have a truer\nclaim to be called the martyrs of science than a Galileo or a Kepler. To\nuse Kossuth's eloquent phrase, they are the unnamed demigods of the\nnineteenth century.\"[B]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"There's a fallacy _somewhere_,\" he murmured drowsily, as he stretched\nhis long legs upon the sofa. \"I must think it over again.\" He closed his\neyes, in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly, and for the\nnext hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the\ncareful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and\nperplexing view of the subject.\n\n[Illustration: \"HE REMAINS STEADFAST AND UNMOVED.\"]\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[Footnote B: _Note by the writer._--For the above Essay I am indebted to\na dear friend, now deceased.]\n\n\n\n\nKNOT X.\n\nCHELSEA BUNS.\n\n   \"Yea, buns, and buns, and buns!\"\n\n                          OLD SONG.\n\n\n\"How very, very sad!\" exclaimed Clara; and the eyes of the gentle girl\nfilled with tears as she spoke.\n\n\"Sad--but very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically,\" was\nher aunt's less romantic reply. \"Some of them have lost an arm in their\ncountry's service, some a leg, some an ear, some an eye----\"\n\n\"And some, perhaps, _all_!\" Clara murmured dreamily, as they passed the\nlong rows of weather-beaten heroes basking in the sun. \"Did you notice\nthat very old one, with a red face, who was drawing a map in the dust\nwith his wooden leg, and all the others watching? I _think_ it was a\nplan of a battle----\"\n\n\"The battle of Trafalgar, no doubt,\" her aunt interrupted, briskly.\n\n\"Hardly that, I think,\" Clara ventured to say. \"You see, in that case,\nhe couldn't well be alive----\"\n\n\"Couldn't well be alive!\" the old lady contemptuously repeated. \"He's as\nlively as you and me put together! Why, if drawing a map in the\ndust--with one's wooden leg--doesn't prove one to be alive, perhaps\nyou'll kindly mention what _does_ prove it!\"\n\nClara did not see her way out of it. Logic had never been her _forte_.\n\n\"To return to the arithmetic,\" Mad Mathesis resumed--the eccentric old\nlady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a\ncalculation--\"what percentage do you suppose must have lost all four--a\nleg, an arm, an eye, and an ear?\"\n\n\"How _can_ I tell?\" gasped the terrified girl. She knew well what was\ncoming.\n\n\"You can't, of course, without _data_,\" her aunt replied: \"but I'm just\ngoing to give you----\"\n\n\"Give her a Chelsea bun, Miss! That's what most young ladies likes\nbest!\" The voice was rich and musical, and the speaker dexterously\nwhipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket, and disclosed a\ntempting array of the familiar square buns, joined together in rows,\nrichly egged and browned, and glistening in the sun.\n\n\"No, sir! I shall give her nothing so indigestible! Be off!\" The old\nlady waved her parasol threateningly: but nothing seemed to disturb the\ngood-humour of the jolly old man, who marched on, chanting his melodious\nrefrain:--\n\n[Music: Chel-sea buns! Chel-sea buns hot! Chel-sea buns!\n\nPi-ping hot! Chel-sea buns hot! Chel-sea buns!]\n\n\"Far too indigestible, my love!\" said the old lady. \"Percentages will\nagree with you ever so much better!\"\n\nClara sighed, and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the\nbasket lessening in the distance: but she meekly listened to the\nrelentless old lady, who at once proceeded to count off the _data_ on\nher fingers.\n\n\"Say that 70 per cent. have lost an eye--75 per cent. an ear--80 per\ncent. an arm--85 per cent. a leg--that'll do it beautifully. Now, my\ndear, what percentage, _at least_, must have lost all four?\"\n\nNo more conversation occurred--unless a smothered exclamation of \"Piping\nhot!\" which escaped from Clara's lips as the basket vanished round a\ncorner could be counted as such--until they reached the old Chelsea\nmansion, where Clara's father was then staying, with his three sons and\ntheir old tutor.\n\nBalbus, Lambert, and Hugh had entered the house only a few minutes\nbefore them. They had been out walking, and Hugh had been propounding a\ndifficulty which had reduced Lambert to the depths of gloom, and had\neven puzzled Balbus.\n\n\"It changes from Wednesday to Thursday at midnight, doesn't it?\" Hugh\nhad begun.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said Balbus, cautiously.\n\n\"Always,\" said Lambert, decisively.\n\n\"_Sometimes_,\" Balbus gently insisted. \"Six midnights out of seven, it\nchanges to some other name.\"\n\n\"I meant, of course,\" Hugh corrected himself, \"when it _does_ change\nfrom Wednesday to Thursday, it does it at midnight--and _only_ at\nmidnight.\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Balbus. Lambert was silent.\n\n\"Well, now, suppose it's midnight here in Chelsea. Then it's Wednesday\n_west_ of Chelsea (say in Ireland or America) where midnight hasn't\narrived yet: and it's Thursday _east_ of Chelsea (say in Germany or\nRussia) where midnight has just passed by?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Balbus said again. Even Lambert nodded this time.\n\n\"But it isn't midnight, anywhere else; so it can't be changing from one\nday to another anywhere else. And yet, if Ireland and America and so on\ncall it Wednesday, and Germany and Russia and so on call it Thursday,\nthere _must_ be some place--not Chelsea--that has different days on the\ntwo sides of it. And the worst of it is, the people _there_ get their\ndays in the wrong order: they've got Wednesday _east_ of them, and\nThursday _west_--just as if their day had changed from Thursday to\nWednesday!\"\n\n\"I've heard that puzzle before!\" cried Lambert. \"And I'll tell you the\nexplanation. When a ship goes round the world from east to west, we\nknow that it loses a day in its reckoning: so that when it gets home,\nand calls its day Wednesday, it finds people here calling it Thursday,\nbecause we've had one more midnight than the ship has had. And when you\ngo the other way round you gain a day.\"\n\n\"I know all that,\" said Hugh, in reply to this not very lucid\nexplanation: \"but it doesn't help me, because the ship hasn't proper\ndays. One way round, you get more than twenty-four hours to the day, and\nthe other way you get less: so of course the names get wrong: but people\nthat live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day.\"\n\n\"I suppose there _is_ such a place,\" Balbus said, meditatively, \"though\nI never heard of it. And the people must find it very queer, as Hugh\nsays, to have the old day _east_ of them, and the new one _west_:\nbecause, when midnight comes round to them, with the new day in front of\nit and the old one behind it, one doesn't see exactly what happens. I\nmust think it over.\"\n\nSo they had entered the house in the state I have described--Balbus\npuzzled, and Lambert buried in gloomy thought.\n\n\"Yes, m'm, Master _is_ at home, m'm,\" said the stately old butler.\n(N.B.--It is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of\nthree M's together, without any interjacent vowels.) \"And the _ole_\nparty is a-waiting for you in the libery.\"\n\n\"I don't like his calling your father an _old_ party,\" Mad Mathesis\nwhispered to her niece, as they crossed the hall. And Clara had only\njust time to whisper in reply \"he meant the _whole_ party,\" before they\nwere ushered into the library, and the sight of the five solemn faces\nthere assembled chilled her into silence.\n\nHer father sat at the head of the table, and mutely signed to the ladies\nto take the two vacant chairs, one on each side of him. His three sons\nand Balbus completed the party. Writing materials had been arranged\nround the table, after the fashion of a ghostly banquet: the butler had\nevidently bestowed much thought on the grim device. Sheets of quarto\npaper, each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other,\nrepresented the plates--penwipers did duty for rolls of bread--while\nink-bottles stood in the places usually occupied by wine-glasses. The\n_pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de resistance_ was a large green baize bag, which gave forth, as\nthe old man restlessly lifted it from side to side, a charming jingle,\nas of innumerable golden guineas.\n\n\"Sister, daughter, sons--and Balbus--,\" the old man began, so nervously,\nthat Balbus put in a gentle \"Hear, hear!\" while Hugh drummed on the\ntable with his fists. This disconcerted the unpractised orator.\n\"Sister--\" he began again, then paused a moment, moved the bag to the\nother side, and went on with a rush, \"I mean--this being--a critical\noccasion--more or less--being the year when one of my sons comes of\nage--\" he paused again in some confusion, having evidently got into the\nmiddle of his speech sooner than he intended: but it was too late to go\nback. \"Hear, hear!\" cried Balbus. \"Quite so,\" said the old gentleman,\nrecovering his self-possession a little: \"when first I began this annual\ncustom--my friend Balbus will correct me if I am wrong--\" (Hugh\nwhispered \"with a strap!\" but nobody heard him except Lambert, who only\nfrowned and shook his head at him) \"--this annual custom of giving each\nof my sons as many guineas as would represent his age--it was a critical\ntime--so Balbus informed me--as the ages of two of you were together\nequal to that of the third--so on that occasion I made a speech----\" He\npaused so long that Balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with\nthe words \"It was a most----\" but the old man checked him with a warning\nlook: \"yes, made a speech,\" he repeated. \"A few years after that, Balbus\npointed out--I say pointed out--\" (\"Hear, hear\"! cried Balbus. \"Quite\nso,\" said the grateful old man.) \"--that it was _another_ critical\noccasion. The ages of two of you were together _double_ that of the\nthird. So I made another speech--another speech. And now again it's a\ncritical occasion--so Balbus says--and I am making----\" (Here Mad\nMathesis pointedly referred to her watch) \"all the haste I can!\" the old\nman cried, with wonderful presence of mind. \"Indeed, sister, I'm coming\nto the point now! The number of years that have passed since that first\noccasion is just two-thirds of the number of guineas I then gave you.\nNow, my boys, calculate your ages from the _data_, and you shall have\nthe money!\"\n\n\"But we _know_ our ages!\" cried Hugh.\n\n\"Silence, sir!\" thundered the old man, rising to his full height (he was\nexactly five-foot five) in his indignation. \"I say you must use the\n_data_ only! You mustn't even assume _which_ it is that comes of age!\"\nHe clutched the bag as he spoke, and with tottering steps (it was about\nas much as he could do to carry it) he left the room.\n\n\"And _you_ shall have a similar _cadeau_,\" the old lady whispered to her\nniece, \"when you've calculated that percentage!\" And she followed her\nbrother.\n\nNothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen\nfrom the table, and yet was it--was it a _grin_ with which the father\nturned away from his unhappy sons? Could it be--could it be a _wink_\nwith which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece? And were those--were\nthose sounds of suppressed _chuckling_ which floated into the room, just\nbefore Balbus (who had followed them out) closed the door? Surely not:\nand yet the butler told the cook--but no, that was merely idle gossip,\nand I will not repeat it.\n\nThe shades of evening granted their unuttered petition, and \"closed not\no'er\" them (for the butler brought in the lamp): the same obliging\nshades left them a \"lonely bark\" (the wail of a dog, in the back-yard,\nbaying the moon) for \"awhile\": but neither \"morn, alas,\" (nor any other\nepoch) seemed likely to \"restore\" them--to that peace of mind which had\nonce been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them, and\ncrushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery!\n\n\"It's hardly fair,\" muttered Hugh, \"to give us such a jumble as this to\nwork out!\"\n\n\"Fair?\" Clara echoed, bitterly. \"Well!\"\n\nAnd to all my readers I can but repeat the last words of gentle Clara--\n\n   FARE-WELL!\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n     \"A knot!\" said Alice. \"Oh, do let me help to undo it!\"\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT I.\n\n_Problem._--\"Two travellers spend from 3 o'clock till 9 in walking along\na level road, up a hill, and home again: their pace on the level being 4\nmiles an hour, up hill 3, and down hill 6. Find distance walked: also\n(within half an hour) time of reaching top of hill.\"\n\n_Answer._--\"24 miles: half-past 6.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Solution._--A level mile takes 1\/4 of an hour, up hill 1\/3, down hill\n1\/6. Hence to go and return over the same mile, whether on the level or\non the hill-side, takes 1\/2 an hour. Hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles\nout and 12 back. If the 12 miles out had been nearly all level, they\nwould have taken a little over 3 hours; if nearly all up hill, a little\nunder 4. Hence 3-1\/2 hours must be within 1\/2 an hour of the time taken\nin reaching the peak; thus, as they started at 3, they got there within\n1\/2 an hour of 1\/2 past 6.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-seven answers have come in. Of these, 9 are right, 16 partially\nright, and 2 wrong. The 16 give the _distance_ correctly, but they have\nfailed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been\nreached at _any_ moment between 6 o'clock and 7.\n\nThe two wrong answers are from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST. The former\nmakes the distance \"23 miles,\" while her revolutionary companion puts it\nat \"27.\" GERTY VERNON says \"they had to go 4 miles along the plain, and\ngot to the foot of the hill at 4 o'clock.\" They _might_ have done so, I\ngrant; but you have no ground for saying they _did_ so. \"It was 7-1\/2\nmiles to the top of the hill, and they reached that at 1\/4 before 7\no'clock.\" Here you go wrong in your arithmetic, and I must, however\nreluctantly, bid you farewell. 7-1\/2 miles, at 3 miles an hour, would\n_not_ require 2-3\/4 hours. A NIHILIST says \"Let _x_ denote the whole\nnumber of miles; _y_ the number of hours to hill-top; [** therefore] 3_y_ =\nnumber of miles to hill-top, and _x_-3_y_ = number of miles on the other\nside.\" You bewilder me. The other side of _what_? \"Of the hill,\" you\nsay. But then, how did they get home again? However, to accommodate your\nviews we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the\nopposite side, and also assume (what I grant you is _possible_, though\nit is not _necessarily_ true) that there was no level road at all. Even\nthen you go wrong.\n\nYou say\n\n   \"_y_ = 6 - (_x_ - 3_y_)\/6, ..... (i);\n\n   _x_\/4-1\/2 = 6              ..... (ii).\"\n\nI grant you (i), but I deny (ii): it rests on the assumption that to go\n_part_ of the time at 3 miles an hour, and the rest at 6 miles an hour,\ncomes to the same result as going the _whole_ time at 4-1\/2 miles an\nhour. But this would only be true if the \"_part_\" were an exact _half_,\ni.e., if they went up hill for 3 hours, and down hill for the other 3:\nwhich they certainly did _not_ do.\n\nThe sixteen, who are partially right, are AGNES BAILEY, F. K., FIFEE, G.\nE. B., H. P., KIT, M. E. T., MYSIE, A MOTHER'S SON, NAIRAM, A\nREDRUTHIAN, A SOCIALIST, SPEAR MAIDEN, T. B. C., VIS INERTI\u00c3\u0086, and YAK. Of\nthese, F. K., FIFEE, T. B. C., and VIS INERTI\u00c3\u0086 do not attempt the second\npart at all. F. K. and H. P. give no working. The rest make particular\nassumptions, such as that there was no level road--that there were 6\nmiles of level road--and so on, all leading to _particular_ times being\nfixed for reaching the hill-top. The most curious assumption is that of\nAGNES BAILEY, who says \"Let _x_ = number of hours occupied in ascent;\nthen _x_\/2 = hours occupied in descent; and 4_x_\/3 = hours occupied on\nthe level.\" I suppose you were thinking of the relative _rates_, up\nhill and on the level; which we might express by saying that, if they\nwent _x_ miles up hill in a certain time, they would go 4_x_\/3 miles on\nthe level _in the same time_. You have, in fact, assumed that they took\n_the same time_ on the level that they took in ascending the hill. FIFEE\nassumes that, when the aged knight said they had gone \"four miles in the\nhour\" on the level, he meant that four miles was the _distance_ gone,\nnot merely the rate. This would have been--if FIFEE will excuse the\nslang expression--a \"sell,\" ill-suited to the dignity of the hero.\n\nAnd now \"descend, ye classic Nine!\" who have solved the whole problem,\nand let me sing your praises. Your names are BLITHE, E. W., L. B., A\nMARLBOROUGH BOY, O. V. L., PUTNEY WALKER, ROSE, SEA BREEZE, SIMPLE\nSUSAN, and MONEY SPINNER. (These last two I count as one, as they send a\njoint answer.) ROSE and SIMPLE SUSAN and CO. do not actually state that\nthe hill-top was reached some time between 6 and 7, but, as they have\nclearly grasped the fact that a mile, ascended and descended, took the\nsame time as two level miles, I mark them as \"right.\" A MARLBOROUGH BOY\nand PUTNEY WALKER deserve honourable mention for their algebraical\nsolutions being the only two who have perceived that the question leads\nto _an indeterminate equation_. E. W. brings a charge of untruthfulness\nagainst the aged knight--a serious charge, for he was the very pink of\nchivalry! She says \"According to the data given, the time at the summit\naffords no clue to the total distance. It does not enable us to state\nprecisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the\nroad.\" \"Fair damsel,\" the aged knight replies, \"--if, as I surmise, thy\ninitials denote Early Womanhood--bethink thee that the word 'enable' is\nthine, not mine. I did but ask the time of reaching the hill-top as my\n_condition_ for further parley.

Of these, one is wrong, GALANTHUS\nNIVALIS MAJOR, who insists on inviting _two_ guests, one being the\nGovernor's _wife's brother's father_. If she had taken his _sister's\nhusband's father_ instead, she would have found it possible to reduce\nthe guests to _one_.\n\nOf the nine who send right answers, SEA-BREEZE is the very faintest\nbreath that ever bore the name!

Be thankful to appear\nin the Class-list at all! BOG-OAK and BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE use\ngenealogies which require 16 people instead of 14, by inviting the\nGovernor's _father's sister's husband_ instead of his _father's wife's\nbrother_.

THE LODGINGS.\n\n_Problem._--\"A Square has 20 doors on each side, which contains 21 equal\nparts. They are numbered all round, beginning at one corner. From which\nof the four, Nos. 9, 25, 52, 73, is the sum of the distances, to the\nother three, least?\"\n\n_Answer._--\"From No. 9.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLet A be No. 9, B No. 25, C No. 52, and D No. 73.\n\n   Then AB = [** sqrt](12^{2} + 5^{2}) = [** sqrt]169 = 13;\n   AC = 21;\n   AD = [** sqrt](9^{2} + 8^{2}) = [** sqrt]145 = 12+\n   (N.B. _i.e._ \"between 12 and 13.\")\n   BC = [** sqrt](16^{2} + 12^{2}) = [** sqrt]400 = 20;\n   BD = [** sqrt](3^{2} + 21^{2}) = [** sqrt]450 = 21+;\n   CD = [** sqrt](9^{2} + 13^{2}) = [** sqrt]250 = 15+;\n\n\nHence sum of distances from A is between 46 and 47; from B, between 54\nand 55; from C, between 56 and 57; from D, between 48 and 51. (Why not\n\"between 48 and 49\"? Make this out for yourselves.) Hence the sum is\nleast for A.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-five solutions have been received. Of these, 15 must be marked\n\"0,\" 5 are partly right, and 5 right. Of the 15, I may dismiss\nALPHABETICAL PHANTOM, BOG-OAK, DINAH MITE, FIFEE, GALANTHUS NIVALIS\nMAJOR (I fear the cold spring has blighted our SNOWDROP), GUY, H.M.S.\nPINAFORE, JANET, and VALENTINE with the simple remark that they insist\non the unfortunate lodgers _keeping to the pavement_. (I used the words\n\"crossed to Number Seventy-three\" for the special purpose of showing\nthat _short cuts_ were possible.) SEA-BREEZE does the same, and adds\nthat \"the result would be the same\" even if they crossed the Square, but\ngives no proof of this. M. M. draws a diagram, and says that No. 9 is\nthe house, \"as the diagram shows.\" I cannot see _how_ it does so. OLD\nCAT assumes that the house _must_ be No. 9 or No. 73. She does not\nexplain how she estimates the distances. BEE's Arithmetic is faulty: she\nmakes [** sqrt]169 + [** sqrt]442 + [** sqrt]130 = 741. (I suppose you\nmean [** sqrt]741, which would be a little nearer the truth. But roots\ncannot be added in this manner. Do you think [** sqrt]9 + [** sqrt]16 is\n25, or even [** sqrt]25?) But AYR'S state is more perilous still: she\ndraws illogical conclusions with a frightful calmness. After pointing\nout (rightly) that AC is less than BD she says, \"therefore the nearest\nhouse to the other three must be A or C.\" And again, after pointing out\n(rightly) that B and D are both within the half-square containing A,\nshe says \"therefore\" AB + AD must be less than BC + CD. (There is no\nlogical force in either \"therefore.\" For the first, try Nos. 1, 21, 60,\n70: this will make your premiss true, and your conclusion false.\nSimilarly, for the second, try Nos. 1, 30, 51, 71.)\n\nOf the five partly-right solutions, RAGS AND TATTERS and MAD HATTER (who\nsend one answer between them) make No. 25 6 units from the corner\ninstead of 5. CHEAM, E. R. D. L., and MEGGY POTTS leave openings at the\ncorners of the Square, which are not in the _data_: moreover CHEAM gives\nvalues for the distances without any hint that they are only\n_approximations_. CROPHI AND MOPHI make the bold and unfounded\nassumption that there were really 21 houses on each side, instead of 20\nas stated by Balbus. \"We may assume,\" they add, \"that the doors of Nos.\n21, 42, 63, 84, are invisible from the centre of the Square\"! What is\nthere, I wonder, that CROPHI AND MOPHI would _not_ assume?\n\nOf the five who are wholly right, I think BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE, CAIUS,\nCLIFTON C., and MARTREB deserve special praise for their full\n_analytical_ solutions. MATTHEW MATTICKS picks out No. 9, and proves it\nto be the right house in two ways, very neatly and ingeniously, but\n_why_ he picks it out does not appear. It is an excellent _synthetical_\nproof, but lacks the analysis which the other four supply.\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE\n   CAIUS.\n   CLIFTON C.\n   MARTREB.\n\nII.\n\nMATTHEW MATTICKS.\n\nIII.\n\n   CHEAM.\n   CROPHI AND MOPHI.\n   E.

To solve one there is no data: the other answers itself.\" As\nto the first point, SCRUTATOR is mistaken; there _are_ (not \"is\") data\nsufficient to answer the question. As to the other, it is interesting to\nknow that the question \"answers itself,\" and I am sure it does the\nquestion great credit: still I fear I cannot enter it on the list of\nwinners, as this competition is only open to human beings.\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT III.\n\n_Problem._--(1) \"Two travellers, starting at the same time, went\nopposite ways round a circular railway. Trains start each way every 15\nminutes, the easterly ones going round in 3 hours, the westerly in 2.\nHow many trains did each meet on the way, not counting trains met at the\nterminus itself?\" (2) \"They went round, as before, each traveller\ncounting as 'one' the train containing the other traveller. How many did\neach meet?\"\n\n_Answers._--(1) 19. (2) The easterly traveller met 12; the other 8.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe trains one way took 180 minutes, the other way 120. Let us take the\nL. C. M., 360, and divide the railway into 360 units. Then one set of\ntrains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30\nunits; the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45\nunits. An easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first\ntrain it will meet: it does 2-5ths of this while the other does 3-5ths,\nand thus meets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round. A\nwesterly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it\nwill meet: it does 3-5ths of this while the other does 2-5ths, and thus\nmeets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round. Hence if the\nrailway be divided, by 19 posts, into 20 parts, each containing 18\nunits, trains meet at every post, and, in (1), each traveller passes 19\nposts in going round, and so meets 19 trains. But, in (2), the easterly\ntraveller only begins to count after traversing 2-5ths of the journey,\n_i.e._, on reaching the 8th post, and so counts 12 posts: similarly the\nother counts 8. They meet at the end of 2-5ths of 3 hours, or 3-5ths of\n2 hours, _i.e._, 72 minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty-five answers have been received. Of these 12 are beyond the reach\nof discussion, as they give no working. I can but enumerate their names.\nARDMORE, E. A., F. A. D., L. D., MATTHEW MATTICKS, M. E. T., POO-POO,\nand THE RED QUEEN are all wrong. BETA and ROWENA have got (1) right and\n(2) wrong. CHEEKY BOB and NAIRAM give the right answers, but it may\nperhaps make the one less cheeky, and induce the other to take a less\ninverted view of things, to be informed that, if this had been a\ncompetition for a prize, they would have got no marks. [N.B.--I have\nnot ventured to put E. A.'s name in full, as she only gave it\nprovisionally, in case her answer should prove right.]\n\nOf the 33 answers for which the working is given, 10 are wrong; 11\nhalf-wrong and half-right; 3 right, except that they cherish the\ndelusion that it was _Clara_ who travelled in the easterly train--a\npoint which the data do not enable us to settle; and 9 wholly right.\n\nThe 10 wrong answers are from BO-PEEP, FINANCIER, I. W. T., KATE B., M.\nA. H., Q. Y. Z., SEA-GULL, THISTLEDOWN, TOM-QUAD, and an unsigned one.\nBO-PEEP rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which\nstarted during the 3 hours of her trip, as well as all which started\nduring the previous 2 hours, _i.e._, all which started at the\ncommencements of 20 periods of 15 minutes each; and she is right in\nstriking out the one she met at the moment of starting; but wrong in\nstriking out the _last_ train, for she did not meet this at the\nterminus, but 15 minutes before she got there. She makes the same\nmistake in (2). FINANCIER thinks that any train, met for the second\ntime, is not to be counted. I. W. T. finds, by a process which is not\nstated, that the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes and 26-1\/2\nseconds. KATE B. thinks the trains which are met on starting and on\narriving are _never_ to be counted, even when met elsewhere. Q. Y. Z.\ntries a rather complex algebraical solution, and succeeds in finding the\ntime of meeting correctly: all else is wrong. SEA-GULL seems to think\nthat, in (1), the easterly train _stood still_ for 3 hours; and says\nthat, in (2), the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes 40 seconds.\nTHISTLEDOWN nobly confesses to having tried no calculation, but merely\nhaving drawn a picture of the railway and counted the trains; in (1),\nshe counts wrong; in (2) she makes them meet in 75 minutes. TOM-QUAD\nomits (1): in (2) he makes Clara count the train she met on her arrival.\nThe unsigned one is also unintelligible; it states that the travellers\ngo \"1-24th more than the total distance to be traversed\"! The \"Clara\"\ntheory, already referred to, is adopted by 5 of these, viz., BO-PEEP,\nFINANCIER, KATE B., TOM-QUAD, and the nameless writer.\n\nThe 11 half-right answers are from BOG-OAK, BRIDGET, CASTOR, CHESHIRE\nCAT, G. E. B., GUY, MARY, M. A. H., OLD MAID, R. W., and VENDREDI. All\nthese adopt the \"Clara\" theory. CASTOR omits (1). VENDREDI gets (1)\nright, but in (2) makes the same mistake as BO-PEEP. I notice in your\nsolution a marvellous proportion-sum:--\"300 miles: 2 hours :: one mile:\n24 seconds.\" May I venture to advise your acquiring, as soon as\npossible, an utter disbelief in the possibility of a ratio existing\nbetween _miles_ and _hours_? Do not be disheartened by your two friends'\nsarcastic remarks on your \"roundabout ways.\" Their short method, of\nadding 12 and 8, has the slight disadvantage of bringing the answer\nwrong: even a \"roundabout\" method is better than _that_! M. A. H., in\n(2), makes the travellers count \"one\" _after_ they met, not _when_ they\nmet. CHESHIRE CAT and OLD MAID get \"20\" as answer for (1), by forgetting\nto strike out the train met on arrival. The others all get \"18\" in\nvarious ways. BOG-OAK, GUY, and R. W. divide the trains which the\nwesterly traveller has to meet into 2 sets, viz., those already on the\nline, which they (rightly) make \"11,\" and those which started during her\n2 hours' journey (exclusive of train met on arrival), which they\n(wrongly) make \"7\"; and they make a similar mistake with the easterly\ntrain. BRIDGET (rightly) says that the westerly traveller met a train\nevery 6 minutes for 2 hours, but (wrongly) makes the number \"20\"; it\nshould be \"21.\" G. E. B. adopts BO-PEEP'S method, but (wrongly) strikes\nout (for the easterly traveller) the train which started at the\n_commencement_ of the previous 2 hours. MARY thinks a train, met on\narrival, must not be counted, even when met on a _previous_ occasion.\n\nThe 3, who are wholly right but for the unfortunate \"Clara\" theory, are\nF. LEE, G. S. C., and X. A. B.\n\nAnd now \"descend, ye classic Ten!\" who have solved the whole problem.\nYour names are AIX-LES-BAINS, ALGERNON BRAY (thanks for a friendly\nremark, which comes with a heart-warmth that not even the Atlantic could\nchill), ARVON, BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE, FIFEE, H.

Deducting twice the sum of the 1st and 4th\nweighings, we get 21 lbs. for _thrice_ No. 3, _i.e._, 7 lbs. for No. 3.\nHence, the 2nd and 3rd weighings give 6-1\/2 lbs., 4-1\/2 lbs. for Nos. 2,\n4; and hence again, the 1st and 4th weighings give 5-1\/2 lbs., 3-1\/2\nlbs., for Nos. 1, 5.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNinety-seven answers have been received.

In guessing a\nconundrum, or in catching a flea, we do not expect the breathless victor\nto give us afterwards, in cold blood, a history of the mental or\nmuscular efforts by which he achieved success; but a mathematical\ncalculation is another thing. The names of this \"mute inglorious\" band\nare COMMON SENSE, D. E. R., DOUGLAS, E. L., ELLEN, I. M. T., J. M. C.,\nJOSEPH, KNOT I, LUCY, MEEK, M. F. C., PYRAMUS, SHAH, VERITAS.\n\nOf the eighty-two answers with which the working, or some approach to\nit, is supplied, one is wrong: seventeen have given solutions which are\n(from one cause or another) practically valueless: the remaining\nsixty-four I shall try to arrange in a Class-list, according to the\nvarying degrees of shortness and neatness to which they seem to have\nattained.\n\nThe solitary wrong answer is from NELL. To be thus \"alone in the crowd\"\nis a distinction--a painful one, no doubt, but still a distinction. I am\nsorry for you, my dear young lady, and I seem to hear your tearful\nexclamation, when you read these lines, \"Ah! This is the knell of all my\nhopes!\" Why, oh why, did you assume that the 4th and 5th bags weighed 4\nlbs. each? And why did you not test your answers? However, please try\nagain: and please don't change your _nom-de-plume_: let us have NELL in\nthe First Class next time!\n\nThe seventeen whose solutions are practically valueless are ARDMORE, A\nREADY RECKONER, ARTHUR, BOG-LARK, BOG-OAK, BRIDGET, FIRST ATTEMPT, J. L.\nC., M. E. T., ROSE, ROWENA, SEA-BREEZE, SYLVIA, THISTLEDOWN,\nTHREE-FIFTHS ASLEEP, VENDREDI, and WINIFRED. BOG-LARK tries it by a sort\nof \"rule of false,\" assuming experimentally that Nos. 1, 2, weigh 6 lbs.\neach, and having thus produced 17-1\/2, instead of 16, as the weight of\n1, 3, and 5, she removes \"the superfluous pound and a half,\" but does\nnot explain how she knows from which to take it. THREE-FIFTHS ASLEEP\nsays that (when in that peculiar state) \"it seemed perfectly clear\" to\nher that, \"3 out of the 5 sacks being weighed twice over, 3\/5 of 45 =\n27, must be the total weight of the 5 sacks.\" As to which I can only\nsay, with the Captain, \"it beats me entirely!\" WINIFRED, on the plea\nthat \"one must have a starting-point,\" assumes (what I fear is a mere\nguess) that No. 1 weighed 5-1\/2 lbs. The rest all do it, wholly or\npartly, by guess-work.\n\nThe problem is of course (as any Algebraist sees at once) a case of\n\"simultaneous simple equations.\" It is, however, easily soluble by\nArithmetic only; and, when this is the case, I hold that it is bad\nworkmanship to use the more complex method. I have not, this time, given\nmore credit to arithmetical solutions; but in future problems I shall\n(other things being equal) give the highest marks to those who use the\nsimplest machinery. I have put into Class I. those whose answers seemed\nspecially short and neat, and into Class III. those that seemed\nspecially long or clumsy. Of this last set, A. C.

There are 10 necessary marks in the 1st row, and in\nthe 3rd; but only 7 in the 2nd. Hence we erase all optional marks in the\n1st and 3rd rows, but let them stand in the 2nd.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-two answers have been received. Of these 11 give no working; so,\nin accordance with what I announced in my last review of answers, I\nleave them unnamed, merely mentioning that 5 are right and 6 wrong.\n\nOf the eleven answers with which some working is supplied, 3 are wrong.\nC. H. begins with the rash assertion that under the given conditions\n\"the sum is impossible. For,\" he or she adds (these initialed\ncorrespondents are dismally vague beings to deal with: perhaps \"it\"\nwould be a better pronoun), \"10 is the least possible number of\npictures\" (granted): \"therefore we must either give 2 x's to 6, or 2 o's\nto 5.\" Why \"must,\" oh alphabetical phantom? It is nowhere ordained that\nevery picture \"must\" have 3 marks! FIFEE sends a folio page of solution,\nwhich deserved a better fate: she offers 3 answers, in each of which 10\npictures are marked, with 30 marks; in one she gives 2 x's to 6\npictures; in another to 7; in the 3rd she gives 2 o's to 5; thus in\nevery case ignoring the conditions. (I pause to remark that the\ncondition \"2 x's to 4 or 5 pictures\" can only mean \"_either_ to 4 _or\nelse_ to 5\": if, as one competitor holds, it might mean _any_ number not\nless than 4, the words \"_or_ 5\" would be superfluous.) I. E. A. (I am\nhappy to say that none of these bloodless phantoms appear this time in\nthe class-list. Is it IDEA with the \"D\" left out?) gives 2 x's to 6\npictures. She then takes me to task for using the word \"ought\" instead\nof \"nought.\" No doubt, to one who thus rebels against the rules laid\ndown for her guidance, the word must be distasteful. But does not I. E.\nA. remember the parallel case of \"adder\"? That creature was originally\n\"a nadder\": then the two words took to bandying the poor \"n\" backwards\nand forwards like a shuttlecock, the final state of the game being \"an\nadder.\" May not \"a nought\" have similarly become \"an ought\"? Anyhow,\n\"oughts and crosses\" is a very old game. I don't think I ever heard it\ncalled \"noughts and crosses.\"\n\nIn the following Class-list, I hope the solitary occupant of III. will\nsheathe her claws when she hears how narrow an escape she has had of not\nbeing named at all. Her account of the process by which she got the\nanswer is so meagre that, like the nursery tale of \"Jack-a-Minory\" (I\ntrust I. E. A. will be merciful to the spelling), it is scarcely to be\ndistinguished from \"zero.\"\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   GUY.\n   OLD CAT.\n   SEA-BREEZE.\n\nII.\n\n   AYR.\n   BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE.\n   F.

On the next New-Year's Day they\nhad 60,000_l._ between them. How did they do it?\n\n_Solution._--They went that day to the Bank of England. _A_ stood in\nfront of it, while _B_ went round and stood behind it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo answers have been received, both worthy of much honour. ADDLEPATE\nmakes them borrow \"0\" and steal \"0,\" and uses both cyphers by putting\nthem at the right-hand end of the 1,000_l._, thus producing 100,000_l._,\nwhich is well over the mark. But (or to express it in Latin) AT SPES\nINFRACTA has solved it even more ingeniously: with the first cypher she\nturns the \"1\" of the 1,000_l._ into a \"9,\" and adds the result to the\noriginal sum, thus getting 10,000_l._: and in this, by means of the\nother \"0,\" she turns the \"1\" into a \"6,\" thus hitting the exact\n60,000_l._\n\n\nCLASS LIST\n\nI.\n\nAT SPES INFRACTA.\n\nII.\n\nADDLEPATE.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Problem 2._--_L_ makes 5 scarves, while _M_ makes 2: _Z_ makes 4 while\n_L_ makes 3. Five scarves of _Z_'s weigh one of _L_'s; 5 of _M_'s weigh\n3 of _Z_'s. One of _M_'s is as warm as 4 of _Z_'s: and one of _L_'s as\nwarm as 3 of _M_'s. Which is best, giving equal weight in the result to\nrapidity of work, lightness, and warmth?\n\n_Answer._--The order is _M_, _L_, _Z_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Solution._--As to rapidity (other things being constant) _L_'s merit is\nto _M_'s in the ratio of 5 to 2: _Z_'s to _L_'s in the ratio of 4 to 3.\nIn order to get one set of 3 numbers fulfilling these conditions, it is\nperhaps simplest to take the one that occurs _twice_ as unity, and\nreduce the others to fractions: this gives, for _L_, _M_, and _Z_, the\nmarks 1, 2\/5, 4\/3. In estimating for _lightness_, we observe that the\ngreater the weight, the less the merit, so that _Z_'s merit is to _L_'s\nas 5 to 1. Thus the marks for _lightness_ are 1\/5, 5\/3, 1. And\nsimilarly, the marks for warmth are 3, 1, 1\/4. To get the total result,\nwe must _multiply_ _L_'s 3 marks together, and do the same for _M_ and\nfor _Z_. The final numbers are 1 \u00c3\u0097 1\/5 \u00c3\u0097 3, 2\/5 \u00c3\u0097 5\/3 \u00c3\u0097 1, 4\/3 \u00c3\u0097 1 \u00c3\u0097\n1\/4; _i.e._ 3\/5, 2\/3, 1\/3; _i.e._ multiplying throughout by 15 (which\nwill not alter the proportion), 9, 10, 5; showing the order of merit to\nbe _M_, _L_, _Z_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-nine answers have been received, of which five are right, and\ntwenty-four wrong. These hapless ones have all (with three exceptions)\nfallen into the error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together, for\neach candidate, instead of _multiplying_. _Why_ the latter is right,\nrather than the former, is fully proved in text-books, so I will not\noccupy space by stating it here: but it can be _illustrated_ very easily\nby the case of length, breadth, and depth. Suppose _A_ and _B_ are rival\ndiggers of rectangular tanks: the amount of work done is evidently\nmeasured by the number of _cubical feet_ dug out. Let _A_ dig a tank 10\nfeet long, 10 wide, 2 deep: let _B_ dig one 6 feet long, 5 wide, 10\ndeep. The cubical contents are 200, 300; _i.e._ _B_ is best digger in\nthe ratio of 3 to 2. Now try marking for length, width, and depth,\nseparately; giving a maximum mark of 10 to the best in each contest, and\nthen _adding_ the results!\n\nOf the twenty-four malefactors, one gives no working, and so has no real\nclaim to be named; but I break the rule for once, in deference to its\nsuccess in Problem 1: he, she, or it, is ADDLEPATE. The other\ntwenty-three may be divided into five groups.\n\nFirst and worst are, I take it, those who put the rightful winner\n_last_; arranging them as \"Lolo, Zuzu, Mimi.\" The names of these\ndesperate wrong-doers are AYR, BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE, FURZE-BUSH and\nPOLLUX (who send a joint answer), GREYSTEAD, GUY, OLD HEN, and SIMPLE\nSUSAN. The latter was _once_ best of all; the Old Hen has taken\nadvantage of her simplicity, and beguiled her with the chaff which was\nthe bane of her own chickenhood.\n\nSecondly, I point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst\ncandidate at the top; arranging them as \"Zuzu, Mimi, Lolo.\" They are\nGRAECIA, M. M., OLD CAT, and R. E. X. \"'Tis Greece, but----.\"\n\nThe third set have avoided both these enormities, and have even\nsucceeded in putting the worst last, their answer being \"Lolo, Mimi,\nZuzu.\" Their names are AYR (who also appears among the \"quite too too\"),\nCLIFTON C., F. B., FIFEE, GRIG, JANET, and MRS. SAIREY GAMP. F. B. has\nnot fallen into the common error; she _multiplies_ together the\nproportionate numbers she gets, but in getting them she goes wrong, by\nreckoning warmth as a _de_-merit. Possibly she is \"Freshly Burnt,\" or\ncomes \"From Bombay.\" JANET and MRS. SAIREY GAMP have also avoided this\nerror: the method they have adopted is shrouded in mystery--I scarcely\nfeel competent to criticize it. MRS. GAMP says \"if Zuzu makes 4 while\nLolo makes 3, Zuzu makes 6 while Lolo makes 5 (bad reasoning), while\nMimi makes 2.\" From this she concludes \"therefore Zuzu excels in speed\nby 1\" (_i.e._ when compared with Lolo; but what about Mimi?). She then\ncompares the 3 kinds of excellence, measured on this mystic scale. JANET\ntakes the statement, that \"Lolo makes 5 while Mimi makes 2,\" to prove\nthat \"Lolo makes 3 while Mimi makes 1 and Zuzu 4\" (worse reasoning than\nMRS. GAMP'S), and thence concludes that \"Zuzu excels in speed by 1\/8\"!\nJANET should have been ADELINE, \"mystery of mysteries!\"\n\nThe fourth set actually put Mimi at the top, arranging them as \"Mimi,\nZuzu, Lolo.\" They are MARQUIS AND CO., MARTREB, S. B. B. (first initial\nscarcely legible: _may_ be meant for \"J\"), and STANZA.\n\nThe fifth set consist of AN ANCIENT FISH and CAMEL. These ill-assorted\ncomrades, by dint of foot and fin, have scrambled into the right answer,\nbut, as their method is wrong, of course it counts for nothing. Also AN\nANCIENT FISH has very ancient and fishlike ideas as to _how_ numbers\nrepresent merit: she says \"Lolo gains 2-1\/2 on Mimi.\" Two and a half\n_what_? Fish, fish, art thou in thy duty?\n\nOf the five winners I put BALBUS and THE ELDER TRAVELLER slightly below\nthe other three--BALBUS for defective reasoning, the other for scanty\nworking. BALBUS gives two reasons for saying that _addition_ of marks is\n_not_ the right method, and then adds \"it follows that the decision must\nbe made by _multiplying_ the marks together.\" This is hardly more\nlogical than to say \"This is not Spring: _therefore_ it must be Autumn.\"\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   DINAH MITE.\n   E.

I can only repeat that a\n_literal_ interpretation of \"fill\" would seem to _me_ to require that\n_every_ picture in the gallery should be marked. VIS INERTI\u00c3\u0086 would have\nbeen in the First Class if she had sent in the solution she now offers.\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT VII.\n\n_Problem._--Given that one glass of lemonade, 3 sandwiches, and 7\nbiscuits, cost 1_s._ 2_d._; and that one glass of lemonade, 4\nsandwiches, and 10 biscuits, cost 1_s._ 5_d._: find the cost of (1) a\nglass of lemonade, a sandwich, and a biscuit; and (2) 2 glasses of\nlemonade, 3 sandwiches, and 5 biscuits.\n\n_Answer._--(1) 8_d._; (2) 1_s._ 7_d._\n\n_Solution._--This is best treated algebraically. Let _x_ = the cost (in\npence) of a glass of lemonade, _y_ of a sandwich, and _z_ of a biscuit.\nThen we have _x_ + 3_y_ + 7_z_ = 14, and _x_ + 4_y_ + 10_z_ = 17. And we\nrequire the values of _x_ + _y_ + _z_, and of 2_x_ + 3_y_ + 5_z_. Now,\nfrom _two_ equations only, we cannot find, _separately_, the values of\n_three_ unknowns: certain _combinations_ of them may, however, be found.\nAlso we know that we can, by the help of the given equations, eliminate\n2 of the 3 unknowns from the quantity whose value is required, which\nwill then contain one only. If, then, the required value is\nascertainable at all, it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of\nitself: otherwise the problem is impossible.\n\nLet us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches, and reduce everything to\nbiscuits--a state of things even more depressing than \"if all the world\nwere apple-pie\"--by subtracting the 1st equation from the 2nd, which\neliminates lemonade, and gives _y_ + 3_z_ = 3, or _y_ = 3-3_z_; and then\nsubstituting this value of _y_ in the 1st, which gives _x_-2_z_ = 5,\n_i.e._ _x_ = 5 + 2_z_. Now if we substitute these values of _x_, _y_, in\nthe quantities whose values are required, the first becomes (5 + 2_z_) +\n(3-3_z_) + _z_, _i.e._ 8: and the second becomes 2(5 + 2_z_) + 3(3-3_z_)\n+ 5_z_, _i.e._ 19. Hence the answers are (1) 8_d._, (2) 1_s._ 7_d._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe above is a _universal_ method: that is, it is absolutely certain\neither to produce the answer, or to prove that no answer is possible.\nThe question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values\nare given, so as to form those whose values are required. This is merely\na matter of ingenuity and good luck: and as it _may_ fail, even when the\nthing is possible, and is of no use in proving it _im_possible, I cannot\nrank this method as equal in value with the other. Even when it\nsucceeds, it may prove a very tedious process. Suppose the 26\ncompetitors, who have sent in what I may call _accidental_ solutions,\nhad had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10\ndigits! I suspect it would have been a case of \"silvered is the raven\nhair\" (see \"Patience\") before any solution would have been hit on by\nthe most ingenious of them.\n\nForty-five answers have come in, of which 44 give, I am happy to say,\nsome sort of _working_, and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name,\nand to have their virtues, or vices as the case may be, discussed.\nThirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right, and so\ncannot figure in the Class-list, even though, in 10 of the 13 cases, the\nanswer is right. Of the remaining 28, no less than 26 have sent in\n_accidental_ solutions, and therefore fall short of the highest honours.\n\nI will now discuss individual cases, taking the worst first, as my\ncustom is.\n\nFROGGY gives no working--at least this is all he gives: after stating\nthe given equations, he says \"therefore the difference, 1 sandwich + 3\nbiscuits, = 3_d._\": then follow the amounts of the unknown bills, with\nno further hint as to how he got them. FROGGY has had a _very_ narrow\nescape of not being named at all!\n\nOf those who are wrong, VIS INERTI\u00c3\u0086 has sent in a piece of incorrect\nworking. Peruse the horrid details, and shudder! She takes _x_ (call it\n\"_y_\") as the cost of a sandwich, and concludes (rightly enough) that a\nbiscuit will cost (3-_y_)\/3. She then subtracts the second equation from\nthe first, and deduces 3_y_ + 7 \u00c3\u0097 (3-_y_)\/3-4_y_ + 10 \u00c3\u0097 (3-_y_)\/3 = 3.\nBy making two mistakes in this line, she brings out _y_ = 3\/2. Try it\nagain, oh VIS INERTI\u00c3\u0086! Away with INERTI\u00c3\u0086: infuse a little more VIS: and\nyou will bring out the correct (though uninteresting) result, 0 = 0!\nThis will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3\nunknowns to reveal its _separate_ value. The other competitor, who is\nwrong throughout, is either J. M. C. or T. M. C.: but, whether he be a\nJuvenile Mis-Calculator or a True Mathematician Confused, he makes the\nanswers 7_d._ and 1_s._ 5_d._ He assumes, with Too Much Confidence, that\nbiscuits were 1\/2_d._ each, and that Clara paid for 8, though she only\nate 7!\n\nWe will now consider the 13 whose working is wrong, though the answer is\nright: and, not to measure their demerits too exactly, I will take them\nin alphabetical order. ANITA finds (rightly) that \"1 sandwich and 3\nbiscuits cost 3_d._,\" and proceeds \"therefore 1 sandwich = 1-1\/2_d._, 3\nbiscuits = 1-1\/2_d._, 1 lemonade = 6_d._\" DINAH MITE begins like ANITA:\nand thence proves (rightly) that a biscuit costs less than a 1_d._:\nwhence she concludes (wrongly) that it _must_ cost 1\/2_d._ F. C. W. is\nso beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of \"guilty,\" that\nI have hardly the heart to utter the word, without adding a \"recommended\nto mercy owing to extenuating circumstances.\" But really, you know,\nwhere _are_ the extenuating circumstances? She begins by assuming that\nlemonade is 4_d._ a glass, and sandwiches 3_d._ each, (making with the 2\ngiven equations, _four_ conditions to be fulfilled by _three_ miserable\nunknowns!). And, having (naturally) developed this into a contradiction,\nshe then tries 5_d._ and 2_d._ with a similar result. (N.B. _This_\nprocess might have been carried on through the whole of the Tertiary\nPeriod, without gratifying one single Megatherium.) She then, by a\n\"happy thought,\" tries half-penny biscuits, and so obtains a consistent\nresult. This may be a good solution, viewing the problem as a conundrum:\nbut it is _not_ scientific. JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits!\n\"One sandwich + 3 biscuits\" she makes equal to \"4.\" Four _what_? MAYFAIR\nmakes the astounding assertion that the equation, _s_ + 3_b_ = 3, \"is\nevidently only satisfied by _s_ = 3\/2, _b_ = 1\/2\"! OLD CAT believes that\nthe assumption that a sandwich costs 1-1\/2_d._ is \"the only way to avoid\nunmanageable fractions.\" But _why_ avoid them? Is there not a certain\nglow of triumph in taming such a fraction? \"Ladies and gentlemen, the\nfraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a\nrefining nature: it was, in a word, hopelessly vulgar. Treating it as a\ncirculating decimal (the treadmill of fractions) only made matters\nworse. As a last resource, I reduced it to its lowest terms, and\nextracted its square root!\" Joking apart, let me thank OLD CAT for some\nvery kind words of sympathy, in reference to a correspondent (whose name\nI am happy to say I have now forgotten) who had found fault with me as a\ndiscourteous critic. O. V. L. is beyond my comprehension. He takes the\ngiven equations as (1) and (2): thence, by the process [(2)-(1)] deduces\n(rightly) equation (3) viz. _s_ + 3_b_ = 3: and thence again, by the\nprocess [\u00c3\u009733] (a hopeless mystery), deduces 3_s_ + 4_b_ = 4. I have\nnothing to say about it: I give it up. SEA-BREEZE says \"it is immaterial\nto the answer\" (why?) \"in what proportion 3_d._ is divided between the\nsandwich and the 3 biscuits\": so she assumes _s_ = l-1\/2_d._, _b_ =\n1\/2_d._ STANZA is one of a very irregular metre. At first she (like\nJANET) identifies sandwiches with biscuits. She then tries two\nassumptions (_s_ = 1, _b_ = 2\/3, and _s_ = 1\/2 _b_ = 5\/6), and\n(naturally) ends in contradictions. Then she returns to the first\nassumption, and finds the 3 unknowns separately: _quod est absurdum_.\nSTILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits, as \"articles.\" Is the word\never used by confectioners? I fancied \"What is the next article, Ma'am?\"\nwas limited to linendrapers. TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are\n4 a penny, and then that they are 2 a penny, adding that \"the answer\nwill of course be the same in both cases.\" It is a dreamy remark,\nmaking one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger.\n\"Is this a statement that I see before me?\" If you were to say \"we both\nwalked the same way this morning,\" and _I_ were to say \"_one_ of you\nwalked the same way, but the other didn't,\" which of the three would be\nthe most hopelessly confused? TURTLE PYATE (what _is_ a Turtle Pyate,\nplease?) and OLD CROW, who send a joint answer, and Y. Y., adopt the\nsame method. Y. Y. gets the equation _s_ + 3_b_ = 3: and then says \"this\nsum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways.\" It _may_\nbe, I grant you: but Y. Y. do you say \"must\"? I fear it is _possible_\nfor Y. Y. to be _two_ Y's. The other two conspirators are less positive:\nthey say it \"can\" be so divided: but they add \"either of the three\nprices being right\"! This is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once, oh\nmysterious birds!\n\nOf those who win honours, THE SHETLAND SNARK must have the 3rd class all\nto himself. He has only answered half the question, viz. the amount of\nClara's luncheon: the two little old ladies he pitilessly leaves in the\nmidst of their \"difficulty.\" I beg to assure him (with thanks for his\nfriendly remarks) that entrance-fees and subscriptions are things\nunknown in that most economical of clubs, \"The Knot-Untiers.\"\n\nThe authors of the 26 \"accidental\" solutions differ only in the number\nof steps they have taken between the _data_ and the answers. In order\nto do them full justice I have arranged the 2nd class in sections,\naccording to the number of steps. The two Kings are fearfully\ndeliberate! I suppose walking quick, or taking short cuts, is\ninconsistent with kingly dignity: but really, in reading THESEUS'\nsolution, one almost fancied he was \"marking time,\" and making no\nadvance at all! The other King will, I hope, pardon me for having\naltered \"Coal\" into \"Cole.\" King Coilus, or Coil, seems to have reigned\nsoon after Arthur's time. Henry of Huntingdon identifies him with the\nKing Co\u00c3\u00abl who first built walls round Colchester, which was named after\nhim. In the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester we read:--\n\n   \"Aftur Kyng Aruirag, of wam we habbeth y told,\n   Marius ys sone was kyng, quoynte mon & bold.\n   And ys sone was aftur hym, _Coil_ was ys name,\n   Bothe it were quoynte men, & of noble fame.\"\n\nBALBUS lays it down as a general principle that \"in order to ascertain\nthe cost of any one luncheon, it must come to the same amount upon two\ndifferent assumptions.\" (_Query._ Should not \"it\" be \"we\"? Otherwise the\n_luncheon_ is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost!) He then\nmakes two assumptions--one, that sandwiches cost nothing; the other,\nthat biscuits cost nothing, (either arrangement would lead to the shop\nbeing inconveniently crowded!)--and brings out the unknown luncheons as\n8_d._ and 19_d._, on each assumption. He then concludes that this\nagreement of results \"shows that the answers are correct.\" Now I propose\nto disprove his general law by simply giving _one_ instance of its\nfailing. One instance is quite enough. In logical language, in order to\ndisprove a \"universal affirmative,\" it is enough to prove its\ncontradictory, which is a \"particular negative.\" (I must pause for a\ndigression on Logic, and especially on Ladies' Logic. The universal\naffirmative \"everybody says he's a duck\" is crushed instantly by proving\nthe particular negative \"Peter says he's a goose,\" which is equivalent\nto \"Peter does _not_ say he's a duck.\" And the universal negative\n\"nobody calls on her\" is well met by the particular affirmative \"_I_\ncalled yesterday.\" In short, either of two contradictories disproves the\nother: and the moral is that, since a particular proposition is much\nmore easily proved than a universal one, it is the wisest course, in\narguing with a Lady, to limit one's _own_ assertions to \"particulars,\"\nand leave _her_ to prove the \"universal\" contradictory, if she can. You\nwill thus generally secure a _logical_ victory: a _practical_ victory is\nnot to be hoped for, since she can always fall back upon the crushing\nremark \"_that_ has nothing to do with it!\"--a move for which Man has not\nyet discovered any satisfactory answer. Now let us return to BALBUS.)\nHere is my \"particular negative,\" on which to test his rule. Suppose the\ntwo recorded luncheons to have been \"2 buns, one queen-cake, 2\nsausage-rolls, and a bottle of Zo\u00c3\u00abdone: total, one-and-ninepence,\" and\n\"one bun, 2 queen-cakes, a sausage-roll, and a bottle of Zo\u00c3\u00abdone: total,\none-and-fourpence.\" And suppose Clara's unknown luncheon to have been \"3\nbuns, one queen-cake, one sausage-roll, and 2 bottles of Zo\u00c3\u00abdone:\" while\nthe two little sisters had been indulging in \"8 buns, 4 queen-cakes, 2\nsausage-rolls, and 6 bottles of Zo\u00c3\u00abdone.\" (Poor souls, how thirsty they\nmust have been!) If BALBUS will kindly try this by his principle of \"two\nassumptions,\" first assuming that a bun is 1_d._ and a queen-cake 2_d._,\nand then that a bun is 3_d._ and a queen-cake 3_d._, he will bring out\nthe other two luncheons, on each assumption, as \"one-and-nine-pence\" and\n\"four-and-ten-pence\" respectively, which harmony of results, he will\nsay, \"shows that the answers are correct.\" And yet, as a matter of fact,\nthe buns were 2_d._ each, the queen-cakes 3_d._, the sausage-rolls\n6_d._, and the Zo\u00c3\u00abdone 2_d._ a bottle: so that Clara's third luncheon\nhad cost one-and-sevenpence, and her thirsty friends had spent\nfour-and-fourpence!\n\nAnother remark of BALBUS I will quote and discuss: for I think that it\nalso may yield a moral for some of my readers. He says \"it is the same\nthing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call\nit Arithmetic, or use letters and signs and call it Algebra.\" Now this\ndoes not appear to me a correct description of the two methods: the\nArithmetical method is that of \"synthesis\" only; it goes from one known\nfact to another, till it reaches its goal: whereas the Algebraical\nmethod is that of \"analysis\": it begins with the goal, symbolically\nrepresented, and so goes backwards, dragging its veiled victim with it,\ntill it has reached the full daylight of known facts, in which it can\ntear off the veil and say \"I know you!\"\n\nTake an illustration. Your house has been broken into and robbed, and\nyou appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night. \"Well, Mum, I\ndid see a chap getting out over your garden-wall: but I was a good bit\noff, so I didn't chase him, like. I just cut down the short way to the\nChequers, and who should I meet but Bill Sykes, coming full split round\nthe corner. So I just ups and says 'My lad, you're wanted.' That's all I\nsays. And he says 'I'll go along quiet, Bobby,' he says, 'without the\ndarbies,' he says.\" There's your _Arithmetical_ policeman. Now try the\nother method. \"I seed somebody a running, but he was well gone or ever\n_I_ got nigh the place. So I just took a look round in the garden. And I\nnoticed the foot-marks, where the chap had come right across your\nflower-beds. They was good big foot-marks sure-ly. And I noticed as the\nleft foot went down at the heel, ever so much deeper than the other. And\nI says to myself 'The chap's been a big hulking chap: and he goes lame\non his left foot.' And I rubs my hand on the wall where he got over, and\nthere was soot on it, and no mistake. So I says to myself 'Now where can\nI light on a big man, in the chimbley-sweep line, what's lame of one\nfoot?' And I flashes up permiscuous: and I says 'It's Bill Sykes!' says\nI.\" There is your _Algebraical_ policeman--a higher intellectual type,\nto my thinking, than the other.\n\nLITTLE JACK'S solution calls for a word of praise, as he has written out\nwhat really is an algebraical proof _in words_, without representing any\nof his facts as equations. If it is all his own, he will make a good\nalgebraist in the time to come. I beg to thank SIMPLE SUSAN for some\nkind words of sympathy, to the same effect as those received from OLD\nCAT.\n\nHECLA and MARTREB are the only two who have used a method _certain_\neither to produce the answer, or else to prove it impossible: so they\nmust share between them the highest honours.\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   HECLA.\n   MARTREB.\n\nII.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1 (2 _steps_).\n\n   ADELAIDE.\n   CLIFTON C....\n   E.

TROJANUS however says \"assuming, in default of any\ninformation, that the street enters the square in the middle of each\nside, it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street.\" But\nsurely the other is the more natural assumption?\n\nIn Knot VI., the first Problem was of course a mere _jeu de mots_, whose\npresence I thought excusable in a series of Problems whose aim is to\nentertain rather than to instruct: but it has not escaped the\ncontemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents, who seem to think\nthat Apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch.\nNeither of them has guessed it: and this is true human nature. Only the\nother day--the 31st of September, to be quite exact--I met my old friend\nBrown, and gave him a riddle I had just heard. With one great effort of\nhis colossal mind, Brown guessed it. \"Right!\" said I. \"Ah,\" said he,\n\"it's very neat--very neat. And it isn't an answer that would occur to\neverybody. Very neat indeed.\" A few yards further on, I fell in with\nSmith and to him I propounded the same riddle. He frowned over it for a\nminute, and then gave it up. Meekly I faltered out the answer. \"A poor\nthing, sir!\" Smith growled, as he turned away. \"A very poor thing! I\nwonder you care to repeat such rubbish!\" Yet Smith's mind is, if\npossible, even more colossal than Brown's.\n\nThe second Problem of Knot VI. is an example in ordinary Double Rule of\nThree, whose essential feature is that the result depends on the\nvariation of several elements, which are so related to it that, if all\nbut one be constant, it varies as that one: hence, if none be constant,\nit varies as their product. Thus, for example, the cubical contents of a\nrectangular tank vary as its length, if breadth and depth be constant,\nand so on; hence, if none be constant, it varies as the product of the\nlength, breadth, and depth.\n\nWhen the result is not thus connected with the varying elements, the\nProblem ceases to be Double Rule of Three and often becomes one of great\ncomplexity.\n\nTo illustrate this, let us take two candidates for a prize, _A_ and _B_,\nwho are to compete in French, German, and Italian:\n\n(_a_) Let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their\n_relative_ knowledge of each subject, so that, whether their marks, for\nFrench, be \"1, 2\" or \"100, 200,\" the result will be the same: and let it\nalso be laid down that, if they get equal marks on 2 papers, the final\nmarks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper. This is a\ncase of ordinary Double Rule of Three. We multiply _A_'s 3 marks\ntogether, and do the same for _B_. Note that, if _A_ gets a single \"0,\"\nhis final mark is \"0,\" even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while _B_\ngets only one mark for each paper. This of course would be very unfair\non _A_, though a correct solution under the given conditions.\n\n(_b_) The result is to depend, as before, on _relative_ knowledge; but\nFrench is to have twice as much weight as German or Italian. This is an\nunusual form of question. I should be inclined to say \"the resulting\nratio is to be nearer to the French ratio than if we multiplied as in\n(_a_), and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other\nmultipliers _twice_ to produce the same result as in (_a_):\" _e.g._ if\nthe French Ratio were 9\/10, and the others 4\/9, 1\/9 so that the ultimate\nratio, by method (_a_), would be 2\/45, I should multiply instead by 2\/3,\n1\/3, giving the result, 1\/3 which is nearer to 9\/10 than if he had used\nmethod (_a_).\n\n(_c_) The result is to depend on _actual_ amount of knowledge of the 3\nsubjects collectively. Here we have to ask two questions. (1) What is\nto be the \"unit\" (_i.e._ \"standard to measure by\") in each subject? (2)\nAre these units to be of equal, or unequal value? The usual \"unit\" is\nthe knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly; calling this\n\"100,\" all lower amounts are represented by numbers between \"0\" and\n\"100.\" Then, if these units are to be of equal value, we simply add\n_A_'s 3 marks together, and do the same for _B_.\n\n(_d_) The conditions are the same as (_c_), but French is to have double\nweight. Here we simply double the French marks, and add as before.\n\n(_e_) French is to have such weight, that, if other marks be equal, the\nultimate ratio is to be that of the French paper, so that a \"0\" in this\nwould swamp the candidate: but the other two subjects are only to affect\nthe result collectively, by the amount of knowledge shown, the two being\nreckoned of equal value. Here I should add _A_'s German and Italian\nmarks together, and multiply by his French mark.\n\nBut I need not go on: the problem may evidently be set with many varying\nconditions, each requiring its own method of solution. The Problem in\nKnot VI. was meant to belong to variety (_a_), and to make this clear, I\ninserted the following passage:\n\n\"Usually the competitors differ in one point only. Thus, last year, Fifi\nand Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week, and they\nwere equally light; but Fifi's were twice as warm as Gogo's, and she was\npronounced twice as good.\"\n\nWhat I have said will suffice, I hope, as an answer to BALBUS, who holds\nthat (_a_) and (_c_) are the only possible varieties of the problem, and\nthat to say \"We cannot use addition, therefore we must be intended to\nuse multiplication,\" is \"no more illogical than, from knowledge that one\nwas not born in the night, to infer that he was born in the daytime\";\nand also to FIFEE, who says \"I think a little more consideration will\nshow you that our 'error of _adding_ the proportional numbers together\nfor each candidate instead of _multiplying_' is no error at all.\" Why,\neven if addition _had_ been the right method to use, not one of the\nwriters (I speak from memory) showed any consciousness of the necessity\nof fixing a \"unit\" for each subject. \"No error at all!\" They were\npositively steeped in error!\n\nOne correspondent (I do not name him, as the communication is not quite\nfriendly in tone) writes thus:--\"I wish to add, very respectfully, that\nI think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very\ntrenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when\ncriticising the answer. That such a tone must not be\" (\"be not\"?)\n\"agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly\nhave no great weight with you, but I hope you will feel that it would be\nas well not to employ it, _unless you are quite certain of being correct\nyourself_.\" The only instances the writer gives of the \"trenchant\nexpressions\" are \"hapless\" and \"malefactors.\" I beg to assure him (and\nany others who may need the assurance: I trust there are none) that all\nsuch words have been used in jest, and with no idea that they could\npossibly annoy any one, and that I sincerely regret any annoyance I may\nhave thus inadvertently given. May I hope that in future they will\nrecognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest,\nand the \"words of unmeant bitterness,\" which Coleridge has alluded to in\nthat lovely passage beginning \"A little child, a limber elf\"? If the\nwriter will refer to that passage, or to the preface to \"Fire, Famine,\nand Slaughter,\" he will find the distinction, for which I plead, far\nbetter drawn out than I could hope to do in any words of mine.\n\nThe writer's insinuation that I care not how much annoyance I give to my\nreaders I think it best to pass over in silence; but to his concluding\nremark I must entirely demur. I hold that to use language likely to\nannoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by\nthe plea that I was \"quite certain of being correct.\" I trust that the\nknot-untiers and I are not on such terms as those!\n\nI beg to thank _G. B._ for the offer of a puzzle--which, however, is too\nlike the old one \"Make four 9's into 100.\"\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT VIII.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1. THE PIGS.\n\n_Problem._--Place twenty-four pigs in four sties so that, as you go\nround and round, you may always find the number in each sty nearer to\nten than the number in the last.\n\n_Answer._--Place 8 pigs in the first sty, 10 in the second, nothing in\nthe third, and 6 in the fourth: 10 is nearer ten than 8; nothing is\nnearer ten than 10; 6 is nearer ten than nothing; and 8 is nearer ten\nthan 6.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis problem is noticed by only two correspondents. BALBUS says \"it\ncertainly cannot be solved mathematically, nor do I see how to solve it\nby any verbal quibble.\" NOLENS VOLENS makes Her Radiancy change the\ndirection of going round; and even then is obliged to add \"the pigs must\nbe carried in front of her\"!\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2. THE GRURMSTIPTHS.\n\n_Problem._--Omnibuses start from a certain point, both ways, every 15\nminutes. A traveller, starting on foot along with one of them, meets\none in 12-1\/2 minutes: when will he be overtaken by one?\n\n_Answer._--In 6-1\/4 minutes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Solution._--Let \"_a_\" be the distance an omnibus goes in 15 minutes,\nand \"_x_\" the distance from the starting-point to where the traveller is\novertaken. Since the omnibus met is due at the starting-point in 2-1\/2\nminutes, it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 12-1\/2;\n_i.e._ it goes 5 times as fast. Now the overtaking omnibus is \"_a_\"\nbehind the traveller when he starts, and therefore goes \"_a_ + _x_\"\nwhile he goes \"_x_.\" Hence _a_ + _x_ = 5_x_; _i.e._ 4_x_ = _a_, and _x_\n= _a_\/4. This distance would be traversed by an omnibus in 15\/4 minutes,\nand therefore by the traveller in 5 \u00c3\u0097 15\/4. Hence he is overtaken in\n18-3\/4 minutes after starting, _i.e._ in 6-1\/4 minutes after meeting the\nomnibus.\n\nFour answers have been received, of which two are wrong. DINAH MITE\nrightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they\nmet the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left, but wrongly concludes\nthat, going 5 times as fast, it would overtake them in another minute.\nThe travellers are 5-minutes-walk ahead of the omnibus, and must walk\n1-4th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them, which\nwill be 1-5th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time:\nthis will require 1-1\/4 minutes more. NOLENS VOLENS tries it by a\nprocess like \"Achilles and the Tortoise.\" He rightly states that, when\nthe overtaking omnibus leaves the gate, the travellers are 1-5th of\n\"_a_\" ahead, and that it will take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse\nthis distance; \"during which time\" the travellers, he tells us, go\n1-15th of \"_a_\" (this should be 1-25th). The travellers being now 1-15th\nof \"_a_\" ahead, he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for\nthe travellers to go 1-60th of \"_a_,\" while the omnibus goes 1-12th. The\n_principle_ is correct, and might have been applied earlier.\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   BALBUS.\n   DELTA.\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT IX.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1. THE BUCKETS.\n\n_Problem._--Lardner states that a solid, immersed in a fluid, displaces\nan amount equal to itself in bulk. How can this be true of a small\nbucket floating in a larger one?\n\n_Solution._--Lardner means, by \"displaces,\" \"occupies a space which\nmight be filled with water without any change in the surroundings.\" If\nthe portion of the floating bucket, which is above the water, could be\nannihilated, and the rest of it transformed into water, the surrounding\nwater would not change its position: which agrees with Lardner's\nstatement.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive answers have been received, none of which explains the difficulty\narising from the well-known fact that a floating body is the same weight\nas the displaced fluid. HECLA says that \"only that portion of the\nsmaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can\nbe properly said to be immersed, and only an equal bulk of water is\ndisplaced.\" Hence, according to HECLA, a solid, whose weight was equal\nto that of an equal bulk of water, would not float till the whole of it\nwas below \"the original level\" of the water: but, as a matter of fact,\nit would float as soon as it was all under water. MAGPIE says the\nfallacy is \"the assumption that one body can displace another from a\nplace where it isn't,\" and that Lardner's assertion is incorrect, except\nwhen the containing vessel \"was originally full to the brim.\" But the\nquestion of floating depends on the present state of things, not on past\nhistory. OLD KING COLE takes the same view as HECLA. TYMPANUM and VINDEX\nassume that \"displaced\" means \"raised above its original level,\" and\nmerely explain how it comes to pass that the water, so raised, is less\nin bulk than the immersed portion of bucket, and thus land\nthemselves--or rather set themselves floating--in the same boat as\nHECLA.\n\nI regret that there is no Class-list to publish for this Problem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2. BALBUS' ESSAY.\n\n_Problem._--Balbus states that if a certain solid be immersed in a\ncertain vessel of water, the water will rise through a series of\ndistances, two inches, one inch, half an inch, &c., which series has no\nend. He concludes that the water will rise without limit. Is this true?\n\n_Solution._--No. This series can never reach 4 inches, since, however\nmany terms we take, we are always short of 4 inches by an amount equal\nto the last term taken.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree answers have been received--but only two seem to me worthy of\nhonours.\n\nTYMPANUM says that the statement about the stick \"is merely a blind, to\nwhich the old answer may well be applied, _solvitur ambulando_, or\nrather _mergendo_.\" I trust TYMPANUM will not test this in his own\nperson, by taking the place of the man in Balbus' Essay! He would\ninfallibly be drowned.\n\nOLD KING COLE rightly points out that the series, 2, 1, &c., is a\ndecreasing Geometrical Progression: while VINDEX rightly identifies the\nfallacy as that of \"Achilles and the Tortoise.\"\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   OLD KING COLE.\n   VINDEX.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3. THE GARDEN.\n\n_Problem._--An oblong garden, half a yard longer than wide, consists\nentirely of a gravel-walk, spirally arranged, a yard wide and 3,630\nyards long. Find the dimensions of the garden.\n\n_Answer._--60, 60-1\/2.\n\n_Solution._--The number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in\nwalking along a straight piece of walk, is evidently the same as the\nnumber of square-yards and fractions of a square-yard, contained in that\npiece of walk: and the distance, traversed in passing through a\nsquare-yard at a corner, is evidently a yard. Hence the area of the\ngarden is 3,630 square-yards: _i.e._, if _x_ be the width, _x_ (_x_ +\n1\/2) = 3,630. Solving this Quadratic, we find _x_ = 60. Hence the\ndimensions are 60, 60-1\/2.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwelve answers have been received--seven right and five wrong.\n\nC. G. L., NABOB, OLD CROW, and TYMPANUM assume that the number of yards\nin the length of the path is equal to the number of square-yards in the\ngarden. This is true, but should have been proved. But each is guilty of\ndarker deeds. C. G. L.'s \"working\" consists of dividing 3,630 by 60.\nWhence came this divisor, oh Segiel? Divination? Or was it a dream? I\nfear this solution is worth nothing. OLD CROW'S is shorter, and so (if\npossible) worth rather less. He says the answer \"is at once seen to be\n60 \u00c3\u0097 60-1\/2\"! NABOB'S calculation is short, but \"as rich as a Nabob\" in\nerror. He says that the square root of 3,630, multiplied by 2, equals\nthe length plus the breadth. That is 60.25 \u00c3\u0097 2 = 120-1\/2. His first\nassertion is only true of a _square_ garden. His second is irrelevant,\nsince 60.25 is _not_ the square-root of 3,630! Nay, Bob, this will _not_\ndo! TYMPANUM says that, by extracting the square-root of 3,630, we get\n60 yards with a remainder of 30\/60, or half-a-yard, which we add so as\nto make the oblong 60 \u00c3\u0097 60-1\/2. This is very terrible: but worse remains\nbehind. TYMPANUM proceeds thus:--\"But why should there be the half-yard\nat all? Because without it there would be no space at all for flowers.\nBy means of it, we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of\nground, two yards long by half-a-yard wide, the only space not occupied\nby walk.\" But Balbus expressly said that the walk \"used up the whole of\nthe area.\" Oh, TYMPANUM! My tympa is exhausted: my brain is num! I can\nsay no more.\n\nHECLA indulges, again and again, in that most fatal of all habits in\ncomputation--the making _two_ mistakes which cancel each other. She\ntakes _x_ as the width of the garden, in yards, and _x_ + 1\/2 as its\nlength, and makes her first \"coil\" the sum of _x_-1\/2, _x_-1\/2, _x_-1,\n_x_-1, _i.e._ 4_x_-3: but the fourth term should be _x_-1-1\/2, so that\nher first coil is 1\/2 a yard too long. Her second coil is the sum of\n_x_-2-1\/2, _x_-2-1\/2, _x_-3, _x_-3: here the first term should be _x_-2\nand the last _x_-3-1\/2: these two mistakes cancel, and this coil is\ntherefore right. And the same thing is true of every other coil but the\nlast, which needs an extra half-yard to reach the _end_ of the path: and\nthis exactly balances the mistake in the first coil. Thus the sum total\nof the coils comes right though the working is all wrong.\n\nOf the seven who are right, DINAH MITE, JANET, MAGPIE, and TAFFY make\nthe same assumption as C. G. L. and Co. They then solve by a Quadratic.\nMAGPIE also tries it by Arithmetical Progression, but fails to notice\nthat the first and last \"coils\" have special values.\n\nALUMNUS ETON\u00c3\u0086 attempts to prove what C. G. L. assumes by a particular\ninstance, taking a garden 6 by 5-1\/2. He ought to have proved it\ngenerally: what is true of one number is not always true of others. OLD\nKING COLE solves it by an Arithmetical Progression. It is right, but too\nlengthy to be worth as much as a Quadratic.\n\nVINDEX proves it very neatly, by pointing out that a yard of walk\nmeasured along the middle represents a square yard of garden, \"whether\nwe consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the\nangles, in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and\nthen turns a right angle and goes half a yard in another direction.\"\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   VINDEX.\n\nII.\n\n   ALUMNUS ETON\u00c3\u0086.\n   OLD KING COLE.\n\nIII.\n\n   DINAH MITE.\n   JANET.\n   MAGPIE.\n   TAFFY.\n\n\nANSWERS TO KNOT X.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1. THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS.\n\n_Problem._--If 70 per cent. have lost an eye, 75 per cent. an ear, 80\nper cent. an arm, 85 per cent. a leg: what percentage, _at least_, must\nhave lost all four?\n\n_Answer._--Ten.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Solution._--(I adopt that of POLAR STAR, as being better than my own).\nAdding the wounds together, we get 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 = 310, among 100\nmen; which gives 3 to each, and 4 to 10 men. Therefore the least\npercentage is 10.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNineteen answers have been received. One is \"5,\" but, as no working is\ngiven with it, it must, in accordance with the rule, remain \"a deed\nwithout a name.\" JANET makes it \"35 and 7\/10ths.\" I am sorry she has\nmisunderstood the question, and has supposed that those who had lost an\near were 75 per cent. _of those who had lost an eye_; and so on. Of\ncourse, on this supposition, the percentages must all be multiplied\ntogether. This she has done correctly, but I can give her no honours,\nas I do not think the question will fairly bear her interpretation,\nTHREE SCORE AND TEN makes it \"19 and 3\/8ths.\" Her solution has given\nme--I will not say \"many anxious days and sleepless nights,\" for I wish\nto be strictly truthful, but--some trouble in making any sense at all of\nit. She makes the number of \"pensioners wounded once\" to be 310 (\"per\ncent.,\" I suppose!): dividing by 4, she gets 77 and a half as \"average\npercentage:\" again dividing by 4, she gets 19 and 3\/8ths as \"percentage\nwounded four times.\" Does she suppose wounds of different kinds to\n\"absorb\" each other, so to speak? Then, no doubt, the _data_ are\nequivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each, and a half-pensioner\nwith a half-wound. And does she then suppose these concentrated wounds\nto be _transferable_, so that 3\/4ths of these unfortunates can obtain\nperfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining 1\/4th?\nGranting these suppositions, her answer is right; or rather, _if_ the\nquestion had been \"A road is covered with one inch of gravel, along 77\nand a half per cent. of it. How much of it could be covered 4 inches\ndeep with the same material?\" her answer _would_ have been right. But\nalas, that _wasn't_ the question! DELTA makes some most amazing\nassumptions: \"let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear,\"\n\"let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm.\"\nHer ideas of a battle-field are grim indeed. Fancy a warrior who would\ncontinue fighting after losing both eyes, both ears, and both arms! This\nis a case which she (or \"it?\") evidently considers _possible_.\n\nNext come eight writers who have made the unwarrantable assumption that,\nbecause 70 per cent. have lost an eye, _therefore_ 30 per cent. have\n_not_ lost one, so that they have _both_ eyes. This is illogical. If you\ngive me a bag containing 100 sovereigns, and if in an hour I come to you\n(my face _not_ beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when I received\nthe bag) to say \"I am sorry to tell you that 70 of these sovereigns are\nbad,\" do I thereby guarantee the other 30 to be good? Perhaps I have not\ntested them yet. The sides of this illogical octagon are as follows, in\nalphabetical order:--ALGERNON BRAY, DINAH MITE, G. S. C., JANE E., J. D.\nW., MAGPIE (who makes the delightful remark \"therefore 90 per cent. have\ntwo of something,\" recalling to one's memory that fortunate monarch,\nwith whom Xerxes was so much pleased that \"he gave him ten of\neverything!\"), S. S. G., and TOKIO.\n\nBRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE and T. R. do the question in a piecemeal\nfashion--on the principle that the 70 per cent. and the 75 per cent.,\nthough commenced at opposite ends of the 100, must overlap by _at least_\n45 per cent.; and so on. This is quite correct working, but not, I\nthink, quite the best way of doing it.\n\nThe other five competitors will, I hope, feel themselves sufficiently\nglorified by being placed in the first class, without my composing a\nTriumphal Ode for each!\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   OLD CAT.\n   OLD HEN.\n   POLAR STAR.\n   SIMPLE SUSAN.\n   WHITE SUGAR.\n\nII.\n\n   BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE.\n   T.

CHANGE OF DAY.\n\nI must postpone, _sine die_, the geographical problem--partly because I\nhave not yet received the statistics I am hoping for, and partly because\nI am myself so entirely puzzled by it; and when an examiner is himself\ndimly hovering between a second class and a third how is he to decide\nthe position of others?\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3. THE SONS' AGES.\n\n_Problem._--\"At first, two of the ages are together equal to the third.\nA few years afterwards, two of them are together double of the third.\nWhen the number of years since the first occasion is two-thirds of the\nsum of the ages on that occasion, one age is 21. What are the other two?\n\n_Answer._--\"15 and 18.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Solution._--Let the ages at first be _x_, _y_, (_x_ + _y_). Now, if _a_\n+ _b_ = 2_c_, then (_a_-_n_) + (_b_-_n_) = 2(_c_-_n_), whatever be the\nvalue of _n_. Hence the second relationship, if _ever_ true, was\n_always_ true. Hence it was true at first. But it cannot be true that\n_x_ and _y_ are together double of (_x_ + _y_). Hence it must be true of\n(_x_ + _y_), together with _x_ or _y_; and it does not matter which we\ntake. We assume, then, (_x_ + _y_) + _x_ = 2_y_; _i.e._ _y_ = 2_x_.\nHence the three ages were, at first, _x_, 2_x_, 3_x_; and the number of\nyears, since that time is two-thirds of 6_x_, _i.e._ is 4_x_. Hence the\npresent ages are 5_x_, 6_x_, 7_x_. The ages are clearly _integers_,\nsince this is only \"the year when one of my sons comes of age.\" Hence\n7_x_ = 21, _x_ = 3, and the other ages are 15, 18.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEighteen answers have been received. One of the writers merely asserts\nthat the first occasion was 12 years ago, that the ages were then 9, 6,\nand 3; and that on the second occasion they were 14, 11, and 8! As a\nRoman father, I _ought_ to withhold the name of the rash writer; but\nrespect for age makes me break the rule: it is THREE SCORE AND TEN. JANE\nE. also asserts that the ages at first were 9, 6, 3: then she calculates\nthe present ages, leaving the _second_ occasion unnoticed. OLD HEN is\nnearly as bad; she \"tried various numbers till I found one that fitted\n_all_ the conditions\"; but merely scratching up the earth, and pecking\nabout, is _not_ the way to solve a problem, oh venerable bird! And close\nafter OLD HEN prowls, with hungry eyes, OLD CAT, who calmly assumes, to\nbegin with, that the son who comes of age is the _eldest_. Eat your\nbird, Puss, for you will get nothing from me!\n\nThere are yet two zeroes to dispose of. MINERVA assumes that, on _every_\noccasion, a son comes of age; and that it is only such a son who is\n\"tipped with gold.\" Is it wise thus to interpret \"now, my boys,\ncalculate your ages, and you shall have the money\"? BRADSHAW OF THE\nFUTURE says \"let\" the ages at first be 9, 6, 3, then assumes that the\nsecond occasion was 6 years afterwards, and on these baseless\nassumptions brings out the right answers. Guide _future_ travellers, an\nthou wilt: thou art no Bradshaw for _this_ Age!\n\nOf those who win honours, the merely \"honourable\" are two. DINAH MITE\nascertains (rightly) the relationship between the three ages at first,\nbut then _assumes_ one of them to be \"6,\" thus making the rest of her\nsolution tentative. M. F. C. does the algebra all right up to the\nconclusion that the present ages are 5_z_, 6_z_, and 7_z_; it then\nassumes, without giving any reason, that 7_z_ = 21.\n\nOf the more honourable, DELTA attempts a novelty--to discover _which_\nson comes of age by elimination: it assumes, successively, that it is\nthe middle one, and that it is the youngest; and in each case it\n_apparently_ brings out an absurdity. Still, as the proof contains the\nfollowing bit of algebra, \"63 = 7_x_ + 4_y_; [** therefore] 21 = _x_ + 4\nsevenths of _y_,\" I trust it will admit that its proof is not _quite_\nconclusive. The rest of its work is good. MAGPIE betrays the deplorable\ntendency of her tribe--to appropriate any stray conclusion she comes\nacross, without having any _strict_ logical right to it. Assuming _A_,\n_B_, _C_, as the ages at first, and _D_ as the number of the years that\nhave elapsed since then, she finds (rightly) the 3 equations, 2_A_ =\n_B_, _C_ = _B_ + _A_, _D_ = 2_B_. She then says \"supposing that _A_ = 1,\nthen _B_ = 2, _C_ = 3, and _D_ = 4. Therefore for _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_,\nfour numbers are wanted which shall be to each other as 1:2:3:4.\" It is\nin the \"therefore\" that I detect the unconscientiousness of this bird.\nThe conclusion _is_ true, but this is only because the equations are\n\"homogeneous\" (_i.e._ having one \"unknown\" in each term), a fact which I\nstrongly suspect had not been grasped--I beg pardon, clawed--by her.\nWere I to lay this little pitfall, \"_A_ + 1 = _B_, _B_ + 1 = _C_;\nsupposing _A_ = 1, then _B_ = 2 and _C_ = 3. _Therefore_ for _A_, _B_,\n_C_, three numbers are wanted which shall be to one another as 1:2:3,\"\nwould you not flutter down into it, oh MAGPIE, as amiably as a Dove?\nSIMPLE SUSAN is anything but simple to _me_. After ascertaining that the\n3 ages at first are as 3:2:1, she says \"then, as two-thirds of their\nsum, added to one of them, = 21, the sum cannot exceed 30, and\nconsequently the highest cannot exceed 15.\" I suppose her (mental)\nargument is something like this:--\"two-thirds of sum, + one age, = 21;\n[** therefore] sum, + 3 halves of one age, = 31 and a half. But 3 halves of\none age cannot be less than 1 and-a-half (here I perceive that SIMPLE\nSUSAN would on no account present a guinea to a new-born baby!) hence\nthe sum cannot exceed 30.\" This is ingenious, but her proof, after that,\nis (as she candidly admits) \"clumsy and roundabout.\" She finds that\nthere are 5 possible sets of ages, and eliminates four of them. Suppose\nthat, instead of 5, there had been 5 million possible sets? Would SIMPLE\nSUSAN have courageously ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and ream\nof paper?\n\nThe solution sent in by C. R. is, like that of SIMPLE SUSAN, partly\ntentative, and so does not rise higher than being Clumsily Right.\n\nAmong those who have earned the highest honours, ALGERNON BRAY solves\nthe problem quite correctly, but adds that there is nothing to exclude\nthe supposition that all the ages were _fractional_. This would make the\nnumber of answers infinite. Let me meekly protest that I _never_\nintended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out\nanswers! E. M. RIX points out that, if fractional ages be admissible,\nany one of the three sons might be the one \"come of age\"; but she\nrightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the\nproblem indeterminate. WHITE SUGAR is the only one who has detected an\noversight of mine: I had forgotten the possibility (which of course\nought to be allowed for) that the son, who came of age that _year_, need\nnot have done so by that _day_, so that he _might_ be only 20. This\ngives a second solution, viz., 20, 24, 28. Well said, pure Crystal!\nVerily, thy \"fair discourse hath been as sugar\"!\n\n\nCLASS LIST.\n\nI.\n\n   ALGERNON BRAY.\n   AN OLD FOGEY.\n   E. M.

ALGERNON\nBRAY states, as a parallel case, \"suppose Tommy's father gives him 4\napples, and he eats one of them, how many has he left?\" and says \"I\nthink we are justified in answering, 3.\" I think so too. There is no\n\"must\" here, and the _data_ are evidently meant to fix the answer\n_exactly_: but, if the question were set me \"how many _must_ he have\nleft?\", I should understand the _data_ to be that his father gave him 4\n_at least_, but _may_ have given him more.\n\nI take this opportunity of thanking those who have sent, along with\ntheir answers to the Tenth Knot, regrets that there are no more Knots to\ncome, or petitions that I should recall my resolution to bring them to\nan end. I am most grateful for their kind words; but I think it wisest\nto end what, at best, was but a lame attempt. \"The stretched metre of an\nantique song\" is beyond my compass; and my puppets were neither\ndistinctly _in_ my life (like those I now address), nor yet (like Alice\nand the Mock Turtle) distinctly _out_ of it. Yet let me at least fancy,\nas I lay down the pen, that I carry with me into my silent life, dear\nreader, a farewell smile from your unseen face, and a kindly farewell\npressure from your unfelt hand! And so, good night!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":631,"split":"train"}
