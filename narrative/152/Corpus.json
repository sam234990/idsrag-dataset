At the outset of the play, the father, Alfred, has just returned from a trip to the mountains. While there, he resolved to focus foremost on raising his son Eyolf, rather than continue work on his book, Human Responsibility. Eyolf, though described as having \"beautiful, intelligent eyes,\" is paralyzed in one of his legs, and thus his life is a sheltered one. He craves more than anything else to live the life of a normal boy, but his father knows that this is not possible. As such, Alfred wants to turn Eyolf towards loftier, intellectual pursuits.\nThe Allmer household is soon visited by the Rat-Wife, a woman capable of enchanting rodents into following her into the sea, where they drown. She leaves when informed that her services are unnecessary, and Eyolf follows her, unnoticed by Alfred, his wife Rita, and Alfred's sister Asta. Once Eyolf is gone, Alfred details his plan for being a better father to Eyolf and allowing him to attain happiness. In the course of his description, they are visited by Borghejm, an engineer, who is interested in Asta. While Asta and Borghejm walk outside, Rita's possessiveness of Alfred is revealed, during which she even wishes that Eyolf had never been born, as he diverts Alfred's attention from herself. Rita and Alfred's conversation is interrupted by the return of Asta and Borghejm, and then followed by sounds of shouts down by the sea, which reveal that Eyolf has drowned after following the Rat-Wife into the sea.\nDown by the sea, Alfred mourns and is comforted by Asta. Rita and Borghejm follow, and once again Borghejm removes Asta from the action allowing for confrontation between Rita and Alfred. In the course of their conversation, Rita talks more about needing Alfred wholly while Alfred reveals that he married Rita in order to be able to better Asta's life. They also each blame each other for Eyolf's injury (as a baby, he fell off a table while they were making love), with Alfred accusing Rita of \"luring me in to you,\" distracting him from his duty to watch over Eyolf.\nBorghejm and Asta return, and Borghejm is once again unsuccessful at convincing Asta to marry him. However, when asked by Alfred and Rita to stay with them and take Eyolf's place, somehow allowing them to ease their guilt and avoid the problems in their relationship, Asta decides to marry Borghejm and follow him north. With Alfred indicating a continued unwillingness to be the husband Rita desires, she shares her new plan to try to better the lives of the poorer children who live down by the sea. In this, Alfred sees something positive again in Rita, and Alfred decides to remain, so that together they can atone for their mistakes.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Little Eyolf, by Henrik Ibsen\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

By this time Ibsen's\ncorrespondence has become so scanty as to afford us no clue to what may\nbe called the biographical antecedents of the play. Even of anecdotic\nhistory very little attaches to it. For only one of the characters has a\ndefinite model been suggested. Ibsen himself told his French translator,\nCount Prozor, that the original of the Rat-Wife was \"a little old woman\nwho came to kill rats at the school where he was educated. She carried\na little dog in a bag, and it was said that children had been drowned\nthrough following her.\" This means that Ibsen did not himself adapt\nto his uses the legend so familiar to us in Browning's _Pied Piper of\nHamelin_, but found it ready adapted by the popular imagination of his\nnative place, Skien. \"This idea,\" Ibsen continued to Count Prozor, \"was\njust what I wanted for bringing about the disappearance of Little Eyolf,\nin whom the infatuation [Note: The French word used by Count Prozor is\n\"infatuation.\" I can think of no other rendering for it; but I do not\nquite know what it means as applied to Allmers and Eyolf.] and the\nfeebleness of his father reproduced, but concentrated, exaggerated, as\none often sees them in the son of such a father.\" Dr. Elias tells us\nthat a well-known lady-artist, who in middle life suggested to him the\nfigure of Lona Hessel, was in later years the model for the Rat-Wife.\nThere is no inconsistency between these two accounts of the matter. The\nidea was doubtless suggested by his recollection of the rat-catcher of\nSkien, while traits of manner and physiognomy might be borrowed from the\nlady in question.\n\nThe verse quoted on pp. 52 and 53 [Transcriber's Note: \"There stood the\nchampagne,\" etc., in ACT I] is the last line of a very well-known poem\nby Johan Sebastian Welhaven, entitled _Republikanerne_, written in 1839.\nAn unknown guest in a Paris restaurant has been challenged by a noisy\nparty of young Frenchmen to join them in drinking a health to Poland. He\nrefuses; they denounce him as a craven and a slave; he bares his breast\nand shows the scars of wounds received in fighting for the country whose\nlost cause has become a subject for conventional enthusiasm and windy\nrhetoric.\n\n   \"De saae pas hverandre. Han vandred sin vei.\n    De havde champagne, men r\u00c3\u00b6rte den ei.\"\n\n\"They looked at each other. He went on his way. There stood their\nchampagne, but they did not touch it.\" The champagne incident leads me\nto wonder whether the relation between Rita and Allmers may not have\nbeen partly suggested to Ibsen by the relation between Charlotte\nStieglitz and her weakling of a husband. Their story must have been\nknown to him through George Brandes's _Young Germany_, if not more\ndirectly. \"From time to time,\" says Dr. Brandes, \"there came over her\nwhat she calls her champagne-mood; she grieves that this is no longer\nthe case with him.\" [Note: _Main Currents of Nineteenth Century\nLiterature_, vol. vi. p. 299] Did the germ of the incident lie in these\nwords?\n\nThe first performance of the play in Norway took place at the\nChristiania Theatre on January 15, 1895, Fru Wettergren playing Rita And\nFru Dybwad, Asta. In Copenhagen (March 13, 1895) Fru Oda Nielsen and Fru\nHennings played Rita and Asta respectively, while Emil Poulsen played\nAllmers. The first German Rita (Deutsches Theater, Berlin, January 12,\n1895) was Frau Agnes Sorma, with Reicher as Allmers. Six weeks later\nFrl. Sandrock played Rita at the Burgtheater, Vienna. In May 1895 the\nplay was acted by M. Lugn\u00c3\u00a9-Po\u00c3\u00ab's company in Paris. The first performance\nin English took place at the Avenue Theatre, London, on the afternoon\nof November 23, 1896, with Miss Janet Achurch as Rita, Miss Elizabeth\nRobins as Asta, and Mrs. Patrick Campbell as the Rat-Wife. Miss\nAchurch's Rita made a profound impression. Mrs. Patrick Campbell\nafterwards played the part in a short series of evening performances.\nIn the spring of 1895 the play was acted in Chicago by a company of\nScandinavian amateurs, presumably in Norwegian. Fru Oda Nielsen has\nrecently (I understand) given some performances of it in New York, and\nMadame Alla Nazimova has announced it for production during the coming\nseason (1907-1908).\n\nAs the external history of _Little Eyolf_ is so short. I am tempted to\ndepart from my usual practice, and say a few words as to its matter and\nmeaning.\n\nGeorge Brandes, writing of this play, has rightly observed that \"a kind\nof dualism has always been perceptible in Ibsen; he pleads the cause of\nNature, and he castigates Nature with mystic morality; only sometimes\nNature is allowed the first voice, sometimes morality. In _The Master\nBuilder_ and in _Ghosts_ the lover of Nature in Ibsen was predominant;\nhere, as in _Brand_ and _The Wild Duck_, the castigator is in the\nascendant.\" So clearly is this the case in _Little Eyolf_ that Ibsen\nseems almost to fall into line with Mr. Thomas Hardy. To say nothing of\nanalogies of detail between _Little Eyolf_ and _Jude the Obscure_, there\nis this radical analogy, that they are both utterances of a profound\npessimism, both indictments of Nature.\n\nBut while Mr. Hardy's pessimism is plaintive and passive, Ibsen's is\nstoical and almost bracing. It is true that in this play he is no\nlonger the mere \"indignation pessimist\" whom Dr. Brandes quite justly\nrecognised in his earlier works. His analysis has gone deeper into the\nheart of things, and he has put off the satirist and the iconoclast. But\nthere is in his thought an incompressible energy of revolt. A pessimist\nin contemplation, he remains a meliorist in action. He is not, like Mr.\nHardy, content to let the flag droop half-mast high; his protagonist\nstill runs it up to the mast-head, and looks forward steadily to the\n\"heavy day of work\" before him. But although the note of the conclusion\nis resolute, almost serene, the play remains none the less an indictment\nof Nature, or at least of that egoism of passion which is one of her\nmost potent subtleties. In this view, Allmers becomes a type of what\nwe may roughly call the \"free moral agent\"; Eyolf, a type of humanity\nconceived as passive and suffering, thrust will-less into existence,\nwith boundless aspirations and cruelly limited powers; Rita, a type of\nthe egoistic instinct which is \"a consuming fire\"; and Asta, a type of\nthe beneficent love which is possible only so long as it is exempt from\n\"the law of change.\" Allmers, then, is self-conscious egoism, egoism\nwhich can now and then break its chains, look in its own visage, realise\nand shrink from itself; while Rita, until she has passed through\nthe awful crisis which forms the matter of the play, is unconscious,\nreckless, and ruthless egoism, exigent and jealous, \"holding to its\nrights,\" and incapable even of rising into the secondary stage of\nmaternal love. The offspring and the victim of these egoisms is Eyolf,\n\"little wounded warrior,\" who longs to scale the heights and dive into\nthe depths, but must remain for ever chained to the crutch of human\ninfirmity. For years Allmers has been a restless and half-reluctant\nslave to Rita's imperious temperament. He has dreamed and theorised\nabout \"responsibility,\" and has kept Eyolf poring over his books, in the\nhope that, despite his misfortune, he may one day minister to parental\nvanity. Finally he breaks away from Rita, for the first time \"in all\nthese ten years,\" goes up \"into the infinite solitudes,\" looks Death in\nthe face, and returns shrinking from passion, yearning towards selfless\nlove, and filled with a profound and remorseful pity for the lot of poor\nmaimed humanity. He will \"help Eyolf to bring his desires into harmony\nwith what lies attainable before him.\" He will \"create a conscious\nhappiness in his mind.\" And here the drama opens.\n\nBefore the Rat-Wife enters, let me pause for a moment to point out that\nhere again Ibsen adopts that characteristic method which, in writing of\n_The Lady from the Sea_ and _The Master Builder_, I have compared to\nthe method of Hawthorne. The story he tells is not really, or rather not\ninevitably, supernatural. Everything is explicable within this limits\nof nature; but supernatural agency is also vaguely suggested, and the\nreader's imagination is stimulated, without any absolute violence to his\nsense of reality. On the plane of everyday life, then, the Rat-Wife is a\ncrazy and uncanny old woman, fabled by the peasants to be a were-wolf in\nher leisure moments, who goes about the country killing vermin. Coming\nacross an impressionable child, she tells him a preposterous tale,\nadapted from the old \"Pied Piper\" legends, of her method of fascinating\nher victims. The child, whose imagination has long dwelt on this\npersonage, is in fact hypnotised by her, follows her down to the sea,\nand, watching her row away, turns dizzy, falls in, and is drowned. There\nis nothing impossible, nothing even improbable, in this. At the same\ntime, there cannot be the least doubt, I think, that in the poet's mind\nthe Rat-Wife is the symbol of Death, of the \"still, soft darkness\" that\nis at once so fearful and so fascinating to humanity. This is clear not\nonly in the text of her single scene, but in the fact that Allmers, in\nthe last act, treats her and his \"fellow-traveller\" of that night among\nthe mountains, not precisely as identical, but as interchangeable,\nideas. To tell the truth, I have even my own suspicions as to who is\nmeant by \"her sweetheart,\" whom she \"lured\" long ago, and who is now\n\"down where all the rats are.\" This theory I shall keep to myself; it\nmay be purely fantastic, and is at best inessential. What is certain is\nthat death carries off Little Eyolf, and that, of all he was, only the\ncrutch is left, mute witness to his hapless lot.\n\nHe is gone; there was so little to bind him to life that he made not\neven a moment's struggle against the allurement of the \"long, sweet\nsleep.\" Then, for the first time, the depth of the egoism which had\ncreated and conditioned his little life bursts upon his parents'\nhorror-stricken gaze. Like accomplices in crime, they turn upon and\naccuse each other--\"sorrow makes them wicked and hateful.\" Allmers, as\nthe one whose eyes were already half opened, is the first to carry war\ninto the enemy's country; but Rita is not slow to retort, and presently\nthey both have to admit that their recriminations are only a vain\nattempt to drown the voice of self-reproach. In a sort of fierce frenzy\nthey tear away veil after veil from their souls, until they realise that\nEyolf never existed at all, so to speak, for his own sake, but only for\nthe sake of their passions and vanities. \"Isn't it curious,\" says Rita,\nsumming up the matter, \"that we should grieve like this over a little\nstranger boy?\"\n\nIn blind self-absorption they have played with life and death, and now\n\"the great open eyes\" of the stranger boy will be for ever upon them.\nAllmers would fain take refuge in a love untainted by the egoism, and\nunexposed to the revulsions, of passion. But not only is Asta's pity\nfor Rita too strong to let her countenance this desertion: she has\ndiscovered that her relation to Allmers is _not_ \"exempt from the law of\nchange,\" and she \"takes flight from him--and from herself.\" Meanwhile\nit appears that the agony which Allmers and Rita have endured in\nprobing their wounds has been, as Halvard Solness would say, \"salutary\nself-torture.\" The consuming fire of passion is now quenched, but \"it,\nhas left an empty place within them,\" and they feel it common need \"to\nfill it up with something that is a little like love.\" They come to\nremember that there are other children in the world on whom reckless\ninstinct has thrust the gift, of life--neglected children, stunted and\nmaimed in mind if not in body. And now that her egoism is seared to the\nquick, the mother-instinct asserts itself in Rita. She will take these\nchildren to her--these children to whom her hand and her heart have\nhitherto been closed. They shall be outwardly in Eyolf's place, and\nperhaps in time they may fill the place in her heart that should have\nbeen Eyolf's. Thus she will try to \"make her peace with the great open\neyes.\" For now, at last, she has divined the secret of the unwritten\nbook on \"human responsibility\" and has realised that motherhood\nmeans--atonement.\n\nSo I read this terrible and beautiful work of art. This, I think, is _a_\nmeaning inherent in it--not perhaps _the_ meaning, and still less all\nthe meanings. Indeed, its peculiar fascination for me, among all Ibsen's\nworks, lies in the fact that it seems to touch life at so many different\npoints. But I must not be understood as implying that Ibsen constructed\nthe play with any such definitely allegoric design as is here set forth.\nI do not believe that this creator of men and women ever started from an\nabstract conception. He did not first compose his philosophic tune and\nthen set his puppets dancing to it. The germ in his mind was dramatic,\nnot ethical; it was only as the drama developed that its meanings dawned\nupon him; and he left them implicit and fragmentary, like the symbolism\nof life itself, seldom formulated, never worked out with schematic\nprecision. He simply took a cutting from the tree of life, and, planting\nit in the rich soil of his imagination, let it ramify and burgeon as it\nwould.\n\nEven if one did not know the date of _Little Eyolf_, one could\nconfidently assign it to the latest period of Ibsen's career, on\nnoting a certain difference of scale between its foundations and its\nsuperstructure. In his earlier plays, down to and including _Hedda\nGabler_, we feel his invention at work to the very last moment, often\nwith more intensity in the last act than in the first; in his later\nplays he seems to be in haste to pass as early as possible from\ninvention to pure analysis. In this play, after the death of Eyolf\n(surely one of the most inspired \"situations\" in all drama) there is\npractically no external action whatsoever. Nothing happens save in the\nsouls of the characters; there is no further invention, but rather what\none may perhaps call inquisition. This does not prevent the second act\nfrom being quite the most poignant or the third act from being one of\nthe most moving that Ibsen ever wrote. Far from wishing to depreciate\nthe play, I rate it more highly, perhaps, than most critics--among the\nvery greatest of Ibsen's achievements. I merely note as a characteristic\nof the poet's latest manner this disparity of scale between the work\nforeshadowed, so to speak, and the work completed. We shall find it\nstill more evident in the case of _John Gabriel Borkman_.\n\n\n\n\nLITTLE EYOLF\n\n(1894)\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n     ALFRED ALLMERS, landed proprietor and man of letters\n        formerly a tutor.\n     MRS.

At the back, open glass doors, leading out to a verandah. An\nextensive view over the fiord. In the distance, wooded hillsides. A door\nin each of the side walls, the one on the right a folding door, placed\nfar back. In front on the right, a sofa, with cushions and rugs. Beside\nthe sofa, a small table, and chairs. In front, on the left, a larger\ntable, with arm-chairs around it. On the table stands an open hand-bag.\nIt is an early summer morning, with warm sunshine.]\n\n[Mrs. RITA ALLMERS stands beside the table, facing towards the\nleft, engaged in unpacking the bag. She is a handsome, rather tall,\nwell-developed blonde, about thirty years of age, dressed in a\nlight-coloured morning-gown.]\n\n[Shortly after, Miss ASTA ALLMERS enters by the door on the right,\nwearing a light brown summer dress, with hat, jacket, and parasol. Under\nher arm she carries a locked portfolio of considerable size. She\nis slim, of middle height, with dark hair, and deep, earnest eyes.\nTwenty-five years old.]\n\nASTA. [As she enters.] Good-morning, my dear Rita.\n\nRITA. [Turns her head, and nods to her.] What! is that you, Asta? Come\nall the way from town so early?\n\nASTA. [Takes of her things, and lays them on a chair beside the door.]\nYes, such a restless feeling came over me. I felt I must come out\nto-day, and see how little Eyolf was getting on--and you too. [Lays the\nportfolio on the table beside the sofa.] So I took the steamer, and here\nI am.\n\nRITA. [Smiling to her.] And I daresay you met one or other of your\nfriends on board? Quite by chance, of course.\n\nASTA. [Quietly.] No, I did not meet a soul I knew. [Sees the bag.] Why,\nRita, what have you got there?\n\nRITA. [Still unpacking.] Alfred's travelling-bag. Don't you recognise\nit?\n\nASTA. [Joyfully, approaching her.] What! Has Alfred come home?\n\nRITA. Yes, only think--he came quite unexpectedly by the late train last\nnight.\n\nASTA. Oh, then that was what my feeling meant! It was that that drew\nme out here! And he hadn't written a line to let you know? Not even a\npost-card?\n\nRITA. Not a single word.\n\nASTA. Did he not even telegraph?\n\nRITA. Yes, an hour before he arrived--quite curtly and coldly. [Laughs.]\nDon't you think that was like him, Asta?\n\nASTA. Yes; he goes so quietly about everything.\n\nRITA. But that made it all the more delightful to have him again.\n\nASTA. Yes, I am sure it would.\n\nRITA. A whole fortnight before I expected him!\n\nASTA. And is he quite well? Not in low spirits?\n\nRITA. [Closes the bag with a snap, and smiles at her.] He looked quite\ntransfigured as he stood in the doorway.\n\nASTA. And was he not the least bit tired either?\n\nRITA. Oh, yes, he seemed to be tired enough--very tired, in fact. But,\npoor fellow, he had come on foot the greater part of the way.\n\nASTA. And then perhaps the high mountain air may have been rather too\nkeen for him.\n\nRITA. Oh, no; I don't think so at all. I haven't heard him cough once.\n\nASTA. Ah, there you see now! It was a good thing, after all, that the\ndoctor talked him into taking this tour.\n\nRITA. Yes, now that it is safely over.--But I can tell you it has been a\nterrible time for me, Asta. I have never cared to talk about it--and you\nso seldom came out to see me, too--\n\nASTA. Yes, I daresay that wasn't very nice of me--but--\n\nRITA. Well, well, well, of course you had your school to attend to in\ntown. [Smiling.] And then our road-maker friend--of course he was away\ntoo.\n\nASTA. Oh, don't talk like that, Rita.\n\nRITA. Very well, then; we will leave the road-maker out of the\nquestion.--You can't think how I have been longing for Alfred! How empty\nthe place seemed! How desolate! Ugh, it felt as if there had been a\nfuneral in the house!\n\nASTA. Why, dear me, only six or seven weeks--\n\nRITA. Yes; but you must remember that Alfred has never been away from\nme before--never so much as twenty-four hours. Not once in all these ten\nyears.\n\nASTA. No; but that is just why I really think it was high time he should\nhave a little outing this year. He ought to have gone for a tramp in the\nmountains every summer--he really ought.\n\nRITA. [Half smiling.] Oh yes, it's all very well for you to talk. If\nI were as--as reasonable its you, I suppose I should have let him go\nbefore--perhaps. But I positively could not, Asta! It seemed to me I\nshould never get him back again. Surely you can understand that?\n\nASTA. No. But I daresay that is because I have no one to lose.\n\nRITA. [With a teasing smile.] Really? No one at all?\n\nASTA. Not that _I_ know of. [Changing the subject.] But tell me, Rita,\nwhere is Alfred? Is he still asleep?\n\nRITA. Oh, not at all. He got up as early as ever to-day.\n\nASTA. Then he can't have been so very tired after all.\n\nRITA. Yes, he was last night--when he arrived. But now he has had little\nEyolf with him in his room for a whole hour and more.\n\nASTA. Poor little white-faced boy! Has he to be for ever at his lessons\nagain?\n\nRITA. [With a slight shrug.] Alfred will have it so, you know.\n\nASTA. Yes; but I think you ought to put down your foot about it, Rita.\n\nRITA. [Somewhat impatiently.] Oh no; come now, I really cannot meddle\nwith that. Alfred knows so much better about these things than I do. And\nwhat would you have Eyolf do? He can't run about and play, you see--like\nother children.\n\nASTA. [With decision.] I will talk to Alfred about this.\n\nRITA. Yes, do; I wish you would.--Oh! here he is.\n\n[ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed in light summer clothes, enters by the door on\nthe left, leading EYOLF by the hand. He is a slim, lightly-built man of\nabout thirty-six or thirty-seven, with gentle eyes, and thin brown hair\nand beard. His expression is serious and thoughtful. EYOLF wears a suit\ncut like a uniform, with gold braid and gilt military buttons. He is\nlame, and walks with a crutch under his left arm. His leg is shrunken.\nHe is undersized, and looks delicate, but has beautiful intelligent\neyes.]\n\nALLMERS. [Drops EYOLF's hand, goes up to ASTA with an expression of\nmarked pleasure, and holds out both his hands to her.] Asta! My dearest\nAsta! To think of your coming! To think of my seeing you so soon!\n\nASTA. I felt I must--. Welcome home again!\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking her hands.] Thank you for coming.\n\nRITA. Doesn't he look well?\n\nASTA. [Gazes fixedly at him.] Splendid! Quite splendid! His eyes are so\nmuch brighter! And I suppose you have done a great deal of writing on\nyour travels? [With an outburst of joy.] I shouldn't wonder if you had\nfinished the whole book, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] The book? Oh, the book--\n\nASTA. Yes, I was sure you would find it go so easily when once you got\naway.\n\nALLMERS. So I thought too. But, do you know, I didn't find it so at all.\nThe truth is, I have not written a line of the book.\n\nASTA. Not a line?\n\nRITA. Oho! I wondered when I found all the paper lying untouched in your\nbag.\n\nASTA. But, my dear Alfred, what have you been doing all this time?\n\nALLMERS. [Smiling.] Only thinking and thinking and thinking.\n\nRITA. [Putting her arm round his neck.] And thinking a little, too, of\nthose you had left at home?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure of that. I have thought a great deal of\nyou--every single day.\n\nRITA. [Taking her arm away.] Ah, that is all I care about.\n\nASTA. But you haven't even touched the book! And yet you can look so\nhappy and contented! That is not what you generally do--I mean when your\nwork is going badly.\n\nALLMERS. You are right there. You see, I have been such a fool hitherto.\nAll the best that is in you goes into thinking. What you put on paper is\nworth very little.\n\nASTA. [Exclaiming.] Worth very little!\n\nRITA. [Laughing.] What an absurd thing to say, Alfred.\n\nEYOLF. [Looks confidingly up at him.] Oh yes, Papa, what you write is\nworth a great deal!\n\nALLMERS. [Smiling and stroking his hair.] Well, well, since you say\nso.--But I can tell you, someone is coming after me who will do it\nbetter.\n\nEYOLF. Who can that be? Oh, tell me!\n\nALLMERS. Only wait--you may be sure he will come, and let us hear of\nhim.\n\nEYOLF. And what will you do then?\n\nALLMERS. [Seriously.] Then I will go to the mountains again--\n\nRITA. Fie, Alfred! For shame!\n\nALLMERS.--up to the peaks and the great waste places.\n\nEYOLF. Papa, don't you think I shall soon be well enough for you to take\nme with you?\n\nALLMERS. [With painful emotion.] Oh, yes, perhaps, my little boy.\n\nEYOLF. It would be so splendid, you know, if I could climb the\nmountains, like you.\n\nASTA. [Changing the subject.] Why, how beautifully you are dressed\nto-day, Eyolf!\n\nEYOLF. Yes, don't you think so, Auntie?\n\nASTA. Yes, indeed. Is it in honour of Papa that you have got your new\nclothes on?\n\nEYOLF. Yes, I asked Mama to let me. I wanted so to let Papa see me in\nthem.\n\nALLMERS. [In a low voice, to RITA.] You shouldn't have given him clothes\nlike that.\n\nRITA. [In a low voice.] Oh, he has teased me so long about them--he had\nset his heart on them. He gave me no peace.\n\nEYOLF. And I forgot to tell you, Papa--Borgheim has bought me a new bow.\nAnd he has taught me how to shoot with it too.\n\nALLMERS. Ah, there now--that's just the sort of thing for you, Eyolf.\n\nEYOLF. And next time he comes, I shall ask him to teach me to swim, too.\n\nALLMERS. To swim! Oh, what makes you want to learn swimming?\n\nEYOLF. Well, you know, all the boys down at the beach can swim. I am the\nonly one that can't.\n\nALLMERS. [With emotion, taking him in his arms.] You shall learn\nwhatever you like--everything you really want to.\n\nEYOLF. Then do you know what I want most of all, Papa?\n\nALLMERS. No; tell me.\n\nEYOLF. I want most of all to be a soldier.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, little Eyolf, there are many, many other things that are\nbetter than that.\n\nEYOLF. Ah, but when I grow big, then I shall have to be a soldier. You\nknow that, don't you?\n\nALLMERS. [Clenching his hands together.] Well, well, well: we shall\nsee--\n\nASTA. [Seating herself at the table on the left.] Eyolf! Come here to\nme, and I will tell you something.\n\nEYOLF. [Goes up to her.] What is it, Auntie?\n\nASTA. What do you think, Eyolf--I have seen the Rat-Wife.\n\nEYOLF. What! Seen the Rat-Wife! Oh, you're only making a fool of me!\n\nASTA. No; it's quite true. I saw her yesterday.\n\nEYOLF. Where did you see her?\n\nASTA. I saw her on the road, outside the town.\n\nALLMERS. I saw her, too, somewhere up in the country.\n\nRITA. [Who is sitting on the sofa.] Perhaps it will be our turn to see\nher next, Eyolf.\n\nEYOLF. Auntie, isn't it strange that she should be called the Rat-Wife?\n\nASTA. Oh, people just give her that name because she wanders round the\ncountry driving away all the rats.\n\nALLMERS. I have heard that her real name is Varg.\n\nEYOLF. Varg! That means a wolf, doesn't it?\n\nALLMERS. [Patting him on the head.] So you know that, do you?\n\nEYOLF. [Cautiously.] Then perhaps it may be true, after all, that she is\na were-wolf at night. Do you believe that, Papa?\n\nALLMERS. Oh, no; I don't believe it. Now you ought to go and play a\nlittle in the garden.\n\nEYOLF. Should I not take some books with me?\n\nALLMERS. No, no books after this. You had better go down to the beach to\nthe other boys.\n\nEYOLF. [Shyly.] No, Papa, I won't go down to the boys to-day.\n\nALLMERS. Why not?\n\nEYOLF. Oh, because I have these clothes on.\n\nALLMERS. [Knitting his brows.] Do you mean that they make fun of--of\nyour pretty clothes?\n\nEYOLF. [Evasively.] No, they daren't--for then I would thrash them.\n\nALLMERS. Aha!--then why--?\n\nEYOLF. You see, they are so naughty, these boys. And then they say I can\nnever be a soldier.\n\nALLMERS. [With suppressed indignation.] Why do they say that, do you\nthink?\n\nEYOLF. I suppose they are jealous of me. For you know, Papa, they are so\npoor, they have to go about barefoot.\n\nALLMERS. [Softly, with choking voice.] Oh, Rita--how it wrings my heart!\n\nRITA. [Soothingly, rising.] There, there, there!\n\nALLMERS. [Threateningly.] But these rascals shall soon find out who is\nthe master down at the beach!\n\nASTA. [Listening.] There is someone knocking.\n\nEYOLF. Oh, I'm sure it's Borgheim!\n\nRITA. Come in.\n\n[The RAT-WIFE comes softly and noiselessly in by the door on the right.\nShe is a thin little shrunken figure, old and grey-haired, with keen,\npiercing eyes, dressed in an old-fashioned flowered gown, with a black\nhood and cloak. She has in her hand a large red umbrella, and carries a\nblack bag by a loop over her arm.]\n\nEYOLF. [Softly, taking hold of ASTA's dress.] Auntie! That must surely\nbe her!\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Curtseying at the door.] I humbly beg pardon--but are\nyour worships troubled with any gnawing things in the house?\n\nALLMERS. Here? No, I don't think so.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. For it would be such a pleasure to me to rid your\nworships' house of them.\n\nRITA. Yes, yes; we understand. But we have nothing of the sort here.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. That's very unlucky, that is; for I just happened to be\non my rounds now, and goodness knows when I may be in these parts\nagain.--Oh, how tired I am!\n\nALLMERS. [Pointing to a chair.] Yes, you look tired.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. I know one ought never to get tired of doing good to the\npoor little things that are hated and persecuted so cruelly. But it\ntakes your strength out of you, it does.\n\nRITA. Won't you sit down and rest a little?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. I thank your ladyship with all my heart. [Seats herself on\na chair between the door and the sofa.] I have been out all night at my\nwork.\n\nALLMERS. Have you indeed?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Yes, over on the islands. [With a chuckling laugh.] The\npeople sent for me, I can assure you. They didn't like it a bit; but\nthere was nothing else to be done. They had to put a good face on it,\nand bite the sour apple. [Looks at EYOLF, and nods.] The sour apple,\nlittle master, the sour apple.\n\nEYOLF. [Involuntarily, a little timidly.] Why did they have to--?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. What?\n\nEYOLF. To bite it?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Why, because they couldn't keep body and soul together\non account of the rats and all the little rat-children, you see, young\nmaster.\n\nRITA. Ugh! Poor people! Have they so many of them?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Yes, it was all alive and swarming with them. [Laughs with\nquiet glee.] They came creepy-crawly up into the beds all night long.\nThey plumped into the milk-cans, and they went pittering and pattering\nall over the floor, backwards and forwards, and up and down.\n\nEYOLF. [Softly, to ASTA.] I shall never go there, Auntie.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. But then I came--I, and another along with me. And we took\nthem with us, every one--the sweet little creatures! We made an end of\nevery one of them.\n\nEYOLF. [With a shriek.] Papa--look! look!\n\nRITA. Good Heavens, Eyolf!\n\nALLMERS. What's the matter?\n\nEYOLF. [Pointing.] There's something wriggling in the bag!\n\nRITA. [At the extreme left, shrieks.] Ugh! Send her away, Alfred.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] Oh, dearest lady, you needn't be frightened of\nsuch a little mannikin.\n\nALLMERS. But what is the thing?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Why, it's only little Mops\u00c3\u00abman. [Loosening the string of\nthe bag.] Come up out of the dark, my own little darling friend.\n\n[A little dog with a broad black snout pokes its head out of the bag.]\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding and beckoning to EYOLF.] Come along, don't be\nafraid, my little wounded warrior! He won't bite. Come here! Come here!\n\nEYOLF. [Clinging to ASTA.] No, I dare not.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Don't you think he has a gentle, lovable countenance, my\nyoung master?\n\nEYOLF. [Astonished, pointing.] That thing there?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Yes, this thing here.\n\nEYOLF. [Almost under his breath, staring fixedly at the dog.] I think he\nhas the horriblest--countenance I ever saw.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Closing the bag.] Oh, it will come--it will come, right\nenough.\n\nEYOLF. [Involuntarily drawing nearer, at last goes right up to her, and\nstrokes the bag.] But he is lovely--lovely all the same.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [In a tone of caution.] But now he is so tired and weary,\npoor thing. He's utterly tired out, he is. [Looks at ALLMERS.] For it\ntakes the strength out of you, that sort of game, I can tell you, sir.\n\nALLMERS. What sort of game do you mean?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. The luring game.\n\nALLMERS. Do you mean that it is the dog that lures the rats?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Nodding.] Mops\u00c3\u00abman and I--we two do it together. And it\ngoes so smoothly--for all you can see, at any rate. I just slip a string\nthrough his collar, and then I lead him three times round the house, and\nplay on my Pan's-pipes. When they hear that, they have got to come up\nfrom the cellars, and down from the garrets, and out of their holes, all\nthe blessed little creatures.\n\nEYOLF. And does he bite them to death then?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Oh, not at all! No, we go down to the boat, he and I\ndo--and then they follow after us, both the big ones and the little\nratikins.\n\nEYOLF. [Eagerly.] And what then--tell me!\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Then we push out from the land, and I scull with one\noar, and play on my Pan's-pipes. And Mops\u00c3\u00abman, he swims behind. [With\nglittering eyes.] And all the creepers and crawlers, they follow and\nfollow us out into the deep, deep waters. Ay, for they have to.\n\nEYOLF. Why do they have to?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Just because they want not to--just because they are so\ndeadly afraid of the water. That is why they have got to plunge into it.\n\nEYOLF. Are they drowned, then?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Every blessed one. [More softly.] And there it is all as\nstill, and soft, and dark as their hearts can desire, the lovely little\nthings. Down there they sleep a long, sweet sleep, with no one to hate\nthem or persecute them any more. [Rises.] In the old days, I can tell\nyou, I didn't need any Mops\u00c3\u00abman. Then I did the luring myself--I alone.\n\nEYOLF. And what did you lure then?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Men. One most of all.\n\nEYOLF. [With eagerness.] Oh, who was that one? Tell me!\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Laughing.] It was my own sweetheart, it was, little\nheart-breaker!\n\nEYOLF. And where is he now, then?\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. [Harshly.] Down where all the rats are. [Resuming her\nmilder tone.] But now I must be off and get to business again. Always on\nthe move. [To RITA.] So your ladyship has no sort of use for me to-day?\nI could finish it all off while I am about it.\n\nRITA. No, thank you; I don't think we require anything.\n\nTHE RAT-WIFE. Well, well, your sweet ladyship, you can never tell.\nIf your ladyship should find that there is anything here that keeps\nnibbling and gnawing, and creeping and crawling, then just see and get\nhold of me and Mops\u00c3\u00abman.--Good-bye, good-bye, a kind good-bye to you\nall. [She goes out by the door on the right.]\n\nEYOLF. [Softly and triumphantly, to ASTA.] Only think, Auntie, now I\nhave seen the Rat-Wife too!\n\n[RITA goes out upon the verandah, and fans herself with her\npocket-handkerchief. Shortly afterwards, EYOLF slips cautiously and\nunnoticed out to the right.]\n\nALLMERS. [Takes up the portfolio from the table by the sofa.] Is this\nyour portfolio, Asta?\n\nASTA. Yes. I have some of the old letters in it.\n\nALLMERS. Ah, the family letters--\n\nASTA. You know you asked me to arrange them for you while you were away.\n\nALLMERS. [Pats her on the head.] And you have actually found time to do\nthat, dear?\n\nASTA. Oh, yes. I have done it partly out here and partly at my own rooms\nin town.\n\nALLMERS. Thanks, dear. Did you find anything particular in them?\n\nASTA. [Lightly.] Oh, you know you always find something or other in such\nold papers. [Speaking lower and seriously.] It is the letters to mother\nthat are in this portfolio.\n\nALLMERS. Those, of course, you must keep yourself.\n\nASTA. [With an effort.] No; I am determined that you shall look through\nthem, too, Alfred. Some time--later on in life. I haven't the key of the\nportfolio with me just now.\n\nALLMERS. It doesn't matter, my dear Asta, for I shall never read your\nmother's letters in any case.\n\nASTA. [Fixing her eyes on him.] Then some time or other--some quiet\nevening--I will tell you a little of what is in them.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, that will be much better. But do you keep your mother's\nletters--you haven't so many mementos of her.\n\n[He hands ASTA the portfolio. She takes it, and lays it on the chair\nunder her outdoor things. RITA comes into the room again.]\n\nRITA. Ugh! I feel as if that horrible old woman had brought a sort of\ngraveyard smell with her.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, she was rather horrible.\n\nRITA. I felt almost sick while she was in the room.\n\nALLMERS. However, I can very well understand the sort of spellbound\nfascination that she talked about. The loneliness of the mountain-peaks\nand of the great waste places has something of the same magic about it.\n\nASTA. [Looks attentively at him.] What is it that has happened to you,\nAlfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Smiling.] To me?\n\nASTA. Yes, something has happened--something seems almost to have\ntransformed you. Rita noticed it too.\n\nRITA. Yes, I saw it the moment you came. A change for the better, I\nhope, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. It ought to be for the better. And it must and shall come to\ngood.\n\nRITA. [With an outburst.] You have had some adventure on your journey!\nDon't deny it! I can see it in your face!\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No adventure in the world--outwardly at\nleast. But--\n\nRITA. [Eagerly.] But--?\n\nALLMERS. It is true that within me there has been something of a\nrevolution.\n\nRITA. Oh Heavens--!\n\nALLMERS. [Soothingly, patting her hand.] Only for the better, my dear\nRita. You may be perfectly certain of that.\n\nRITA. [Seats herself on the sofa.] You must tell us all about it, at\nonce--tell us everything!\n\nALLMERS. [Turning to ASTA.] Yes, let us sit down, too, Asta. Then I will\ntry to tell you as well as I can.\n\n[He seats himself on the sofa at RITA's side. ASTA moves a chair\nforward, and places herself near him.]\n\nRITA. [Looking at him expectantly.] Well--?\n\nALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] When I look back over my\nlife--and my fortunes--for the last ten or eleven years, it seems to me\nalmost like a fairy-tale or a dream. Don't you think so too, Asta?\n\nASTA. Yes, in many ways I think so.\n\nALLMERS. [Continuing.] When I remember what we two used to be, Asta--we\ntwo poor orphan children--\n\nRITA. [Impatiently.] Oh, that is such an old, old story.\n\nALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] And now here I am in comfort and\nluxury. I have been able to follow my vocation. I have been able to work\nand study--just as I had always longed to. [Holds out his hand.] And all\nthis great--this fabulous good fortune we owe to you, my dearest Rita.\n\nRITA. [Half playfully, half angrily, slaps his hand.] Oh, I do wish you\nwould stop talking like that.\n\nALLMERS. I speak of it only as a sort of introduction.\n\nRITA. Then do skip the introduction!\n\nALLMERS. Rita,--you must not think it was the doctor's advice that drove\nme up to the mountains.\n\nASTA. Was it not, Alfred?\n\nRITA. What was it, then?\n\nALLMERS. It was this: I found there was no more peace for me, there in\nmy study.\n\nRITA. No peace! Why, who disturbed you?\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] No one from without. But I felt as though\nI were positively abusing--or, say rather, wasting--my best\npowers--frittering away the time.\n\nASTA. [With wide eyes.] When you were writing at your book?\n\nALLMERS. [Nodding.] For I cannot think that my powers are confined to\nthat alone. I must surely have it in me to do one or two other things as\nwell.\n\nRITA. Was that what you sat there brooding over?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, mainly that.\n\nRITA. And so that is what has made you so discontented with yourself\nof late; and with the rest of us as well. For you know you were\ndiscontented, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Gazing straight before him.] There I sat bent over my table,\nday after day, and often half the night too--writing and writing at the\ngreat thick book on \"Human Responsibility.\" H'm!\n\nASTA. [Laying her hand upon his arm.] But, Alfred--that book is to be\nyour life-work.\n\nRITA. Yes, you have said so often enough.\n\nALLMERS. I thought so. Ever since I grew up, I have thought so. [With an\naffectionate expression in his eyes.] And it was you that enabled me to\ndevote myself to it, my dear Rita--\n\nRITA. Oh, nonsense!\n\nALLMERS. [Smiling to her.]--you, with your gold, and your green\nforests--\n\nRITA. [Half laughing, half vexed.] If you begin all that rubbish again,\nI shall beat you.\n\nASTA. [Looking sorrowfully at him.] But the book, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. It began, as it were, to drift away from me. But I was more and\nmore beset by the thought of the higher duties that laid their claims\nupon me.\n\nRITA. [Beaming, seizes his hand.] Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. The thought of Eyolf, my dear Rita.\n\nRITA. [Disappointed, drops his hand.] Ah--of Eyolf!\n\nALLMERS. Poor little Eyolf has taken deeper and deeper hold of me. After\nthat unlucky fall from the table--and especially since we have been\nassured that the injury is incurable--\n\nRITA. [Insistently.] But you take all the care you possibly can of him,\nAlfred!\n\nALLMERS. As a schoolmaster, yes; but not as a father. And it is a father\nthat I want henceforth to be to Eyolf.\n\nRITA. [Looking at him and shaking her head.] I don't think I quite\nunderstand you.\n\nALLMERS. I mean that I will try with all my might to make his misfortune\nas painless and easy to him as it can possibly be.\n\nRITA. Oh, but, dear--thank Heaven, I don't think he feels it so deeply.\n\nASTA. [With emotion.] Yes, Rita, he does.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, you may be sure he feels it deeply.\n\nRITA. [Impatiently.] But, Alfred, what more can you do for him?\n\nALLMERS. I will try to perfect all the rich possibilities that are\ndawning in his childish soul. I will foster all the germs of good in his\nnature--make them blossom and bear fruit. [With more and more warmth,\nrising.] And I will do more than that! I will help him to bring his\ndesires into harmony with what lies attainable before him. That is just\nwhat at present they are not. All his longings are for things that\nmust for ever remain unattainable to him. But I will create a conscious\nhappiness in his mind. [He goes once or twice up and down the room. ASTA\nand RITA follow him with their eyes.]\n\nRITA. You should take these things more quietly, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. [Stops beside the table on the left, and looks at them.] Eyolf\nshall carry on my life-work--if he wants to. Or he shall choose one\nthat is altogether his own. Perhaps that would be best. At all events, I\nshall let mine rest as it is.\n\nRITA. [Rising.] But, Alfred dear, can you not work both for yourself and\nfor Eyolf?\n\nALLMERS. No, I cannot. It is impossible! I cannot divide myself in this\nmatter--and therefore I efface myself. Eyolf shall be the complete man\nof our race. And it shall be my new life-work to make him the complete\nman.\n\nASTA. [Has risen and now goes up to him.] This must have cost you a\nterribly hard struggle, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, it has. At home here, I should never have conquered\nmyself, never brought myself to the point of renunciation. Never at\nhome!\n\nRITA. Then that was why you went away this summer?\n\nALLMERS. [With shining eyes.] Yes! I went up into the infinite\nsolitudes. I saw the sunrise gleaming on the mountain peaks. I felt\nmyself nearer the stars--I seemed almost to be in sympathy and communion\nwith them. And then I found the strength for it.\n\nASTA. [Looking sadly at him.] But you will never write any more of your\nbook on \"Human Responsibility\"?\n\nALLMERS. No, never, Asta. I tell you I cannot split up my life between\ntwo vocations. But I will act out my \"human responsibility\"--in my own\nlife.\n\nRITA. [With a smile.] Do you think you can live up to such high resolves\nat home here?\n\nALLMERS. [Taking her hand.] With you to help me, I can. [Holds out the\nother hand.] And with you too, Asta.\n\nRITA. [Drawing her hand away.] Ah--with both of us! So, after all, you\ncan divide yourself.\n\nALLMERS. Why, my dearest Rita--!\n\n[RITA moves away from him and stands in the garden doorway. A light and\nrapid knock is heard at the door on the right. Engineer BORGHEIM enters\nquickly. He is a young man of a little over thirty. His expression is\nbright and cheerful, and he holds himself erect.]\n\nBORGHEIM. Good morning, Mrs. Allmers. [Stops with an expression of\npleasure on seeing ALLMERS.] Why, what's this? Home again already, Mr.\nAllmers?\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking hands with him.] Yes, I arrived list night.\n\nRITA. [Gaily.] His leave was up, Mr. Borgheim.\n\nALLMERS. No, you know it wasn't, Rita--\n\nRITA. [Approaching.] Oh yes, but it was, though. His furlough had run\nout.\n\nBORGHEIM. I see you hold your husband well in hand, Mrs. Allmers.\n\nRITA. I hold to my rights. And besides, everything must have an end.\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, not everything--I hope. Good morning, Miss Allmers!\n\nASTA. [Holding aloof from him.] Good morning.\n\nRITA. [Looking at BORGHEIM.] Not everything, you say?\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, I am firmly convinced that there are some things in the\nworld that will never come to an end.\n\nRITA. I suppose you are thinking of love--and that sort of thing.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Warmly.] I am thinking of all that is lovely!\n\nRITA. And that never comes to an end. Yes, let us think of that, hope\nfor that, all of us.\n\nALLMERS. [Coming up to them.] I suppose you will soon have finished your\nroad-work out here?\n\nBORGHEIM. I have finished it already--finished it yesterday. It has been\na long business, but, thank Heaven, that has come to an end.\n\nRITA. And you are beaming with joy over that?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, I am indeed!\n\nRITA. Well, I must say--\n\nBORGHEIM. What, Mrs. Allmers?\n\nRITA. I don't think it is particularly nice of you, Mr. Borgheim.\n\nBORGHEIM. Indeed! Why not?\n\nRITA. Well, I suppose we sha'n't often see you in these parts after\nthis.\n\nBORGHEIM. No, that is true. I hadn't thought of that.\n\nRITA. Oh well, I suppose you will be able to look in upon us now and\nthen all the same.\n\nBORGHEIM. No, unfortunately that will be out of my power for a very long\ntime.\n\nALLMERS. Indeed! How so?\n\nBORGHEIM. The fact is, I have got a big piece of new work that I must\nset about at once.\n\nALLMERS. Have you indeed?--[Pressing his hand.]--I am heartily glad to\nhear it.\n\nRITA. I congratulate you, Mr. Borgheim!\n\nBORGHEIM. Hush, hush--I really ought not to talk openly of it as\nyet! But I can't help coming out with it! It is a great piece of\nroad-making--up in the north--with mountain ranges to cross, and\nthe most tremendous difficulties to overcome!--[With an outburst of\ngladness.]--Oh, what a glorious world this is--and what a joy it is to\nbe a road-maker in it!\n\nRITA. [Smiling, and looking teasingly at him.] Is it road-making\nbusiness that has brought you out here to-day in such wild spirits?\n\nBORGHEIM. No, not that alone. I am thinking of all the bright and\nhopeful prospects that are opening out before me.\n\nRITA. Aha, then perhaps you have something still more exquisite in\nreserve!\n\nBORGHEIM. [Glancing towards ASTA.] Who knows! When once happiness comes\nto us, it is apt to come like a spring flood. [Turns to ASTA.] Miss\nAllmers, would you not like to take a little walk with me? As we used\nto?\n\nASTA. [Quickly.] No--no, thank you. Not now. Not to-day.\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, do come! Only a little bit of a walk! I have so much I\nwant to talk to you about before I go.\n\nRITA. Something else, perhaps, that you must not talk openly about as\nyet?\n\nBORGHEIM. H'm, that depends--\n\nRITA. But there is nothing to prevent your whispering, you know. [Half\naside.] Asta, you must really go with him.\n\nASTA. But, my dear Rita--\n\nBORGHEIM. [Imploringly.] Miss Asta--remember it is to be a farewell\nwalk--the last for many a day.\n\nASTA. [Takes her hat and parasol.] Very well, suppose we take a stroll\nin the garden, then.\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, thank you, thank you!\n\nALLMERS. And while you are there you can see what Eyolf is doing.\n\nBORGHEIM. Ah, Eyolf, by the bye! Where is Eyolf to-day? I've got\nsomething for him.\n\nALLMERS. He is out playing somewhere.\n\nBORGHEIM. Is he really! Then he has begun to play now? He used always to\nbe sitting indoors over his books.\n\nALLMERS. There is to be an end of that now. I am going to make a regular\nopen-air boy of him.\n\nBORGHEIM. Ah, now, that's right! Out into the open air with him, poor\nlittle fellow! Good Lord, what can we possibly do better than play\nin this blessed world? For my part, I think all life is one long\nplaytime!--Come, Miss Asta!\n\n[BORGHEIM and ASTA go out on the verandah and down through the garden.]\n\nALLMERS. [Stands looking after them.] Rita--do you think there is\nanything between those two?\n\nRITA. I don't know what to say. I used to think there was. But Asta has\ngrown so strange to me--so utterly incomprehensible of late.\n\nALLMERS. Indeed! Has she? While I have been away?\n\nRITA. Yes, within the last week or two.\n\nALLMERS. And you think she doesn't care very much about him now?\n\nRITA. Not, seriously; not utterly and entirely; not unreservedly--I am\nsure she doesn't. [Looks searchingly at him.] Would it displease you if\nshe did?\n\nALLMERS. It would not exactly displease me. But it would certainly be a\ndisquieting thought--\n\nRITA. Disquieting?\n\nALLMERS. Yes; you must remember that I am responsible for Asta--for her\nlife's happiness.\n\nRITA. Oh, come--responsible! Surely Asta has come to years of\ndiscretion? I should say she was capable of choosing for herself.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, we must hope so, Rita.\n\nRITA. For my part, I don't think at all ill of Borgheim.\n\nALLMERS. No, dear--no more do I--quite the contrary. But all the same--\n\nRITA. [Continuing.] And I should be very glad indeed if he and Asta were\nto make a match of it.\n\nALLMERS. [Annoyed.] Oh, why should you be?\n\nRITA. [With increasing excitement.] Why, for then she would have to go\nfar, far away with him! And she could never come out here to us, as she\ndoes now.\n\nALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] What! Can you really wish Asta\nto go away?\n\nRITA. Yes, yes, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. Why in all the world--?\n\nRITA. [Throwing her arms passionately round his neck.] For then, at\nlast, I should have you to myself alone! And yet--not even then!\nNot wholly to myself! [Bursts into convulsive weeping.] Oh, Alfred,\nAlfred--I cannot give you up!\n\nALLMERS. [Gently releasing himself.] My dearest Rita, do be reasonable!\n\nRITA. I don't care a bit about being reasonable! I care only for you!\nOnly for you in all the world! [Again throwing her arms round his neck.]\nFor you, for you, for you!\n\nALLMERS. Let me go, let me go--you are strangling me!\n\nRITA. [Letting him go.] How I wish I could! [Looking at him with\nflashing eyes.] Oh, if you knew how I have hated you--!\n\nALLMERS. Hated me--!\n\nRITA. Yes--when you shut yourself up in your room and brooded over your\nwork--till long, long into the night. [Plaintively.] So long, so late,\nAlfred. Oh, how I hated your work!\n\nALLMERS. But now I have done with that.\n\nRITA. [With a cutting laugh.] Oh yes! Now you have given yourself up to\nsomething worse.\n\nALLMERS. [Shocked.] Worse! Do you call our child something worse?\n\nRITA. [Vehemently.] Yes, I do. As he comes between you and me, I call\nhim so. For the book--the book was not a living being, as the child is.\n[With increasing impetuosity.] But I won't endure it, Alfred! I will not\nendure it--I tell you so plainly!\n\nALLMERS. [Looks steadily at her, and says in a low voice.] I am often\nalmost afraid of you, Rita.\n\nRITA. [Gloomily.] I am often afraid of myself. And for that very reason\nyou must not awake the evil in me.\n\nALLMERS. Why, good Heavens, do I do that?\n\nRITA. Yes, you do--when you tear to shreds the holiest bonds between us.\n\nALLMERS. [Urgently.] Think what you're saying, Rita. It is your own\nchild--our only child, that you are speaking of.\n\nRITA. The child is only half mine. [With another outburst.] But you\nshall be mine alone! You shall be wholly mine! That I have a right to\ndemand of you!\n\nALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Oh, my dear Rita, it is of no use\ndemanding anything. Everything must be freely given.\n\nRITA. [Looks anxiously at him.] And that you cannot do henceforth?\n\nALLMERS. No, I cannot. I must divide myself between Eyolf and you.\n\nRITA. But if Eyolf had never been born? What then?\n\nALLMERS. [Evasively.] Oh, that would be another matter. Then I should\nhave only you to care for.\n\nRITA. [Softly, her voice quivering.] Then I wish he had never been born.\n\nALLMERS. [Flashing out.] Rita! You don't know what you are saying!\n\nRITA. [Trembling with emotion.] It was in pain unspeakable that I\nbrought him into the world. But I bore it all with joy and rapture for\nyour sake.\n\nALLMERS. [Warmly.] Oh yes, I know, I know.\n\nRITA. [With decision.] But there it must end. I will live my\nlife--together with you--wholly with you. I cannot go on being only\nEyolf's mother--only his mother and nothing more. I will not, I tell\nyou! I cannot! I will be all in all to you! To you, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. But that is just what you are, Rita. Through our child--\n\nRITA. Oh--vapid, nauseous phrases--nothing else! No, Alfred, I am not to\nbe put off like that. I was fitted to become the child's mother, but not\nto be a mother to him. You must take me as I am, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. And yet you used to be so fond of Eyolf.\n\nRITA. I was so sorry for him--because you troubled yourself so little\nabout him. You kept him reading and grinding at books. You scarcely even\nsaw him.\n\nALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] No; I was blind. The time had not yet come\nfor me--\n\nRITA. [Looking in his face.] But now, I suppose, it has come?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, at, last. Now I see that the highest task I can have in\nthe world is to be a true father to Eyolf.\n\nRITA. And to me?--what will you be to me?\n\nALLMERS. [Gently.] I will always go on caring for you--with calm, deep\ntenderness. [ He tries to take her hands.]\n\nRITA. [Evading him.] I don't care a bit for your calm, deep tenderness.\nI want you utterly and entirely--and alone! Just as I had you in the\nfirst rich, beautiful days. [Vehemently and harshly.] Never, never will\nI consent to be put off with scraps and leavings, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. [In a conciliatory tone.] I should have thought there was\nhappiness in plenty for all three of us, Rita.\n\nRITA. [Scornfully.] Then you are easy to please. [Seats herself at the\ntable on the left.] Now listen to me.\n\nALLMERS. [Approaching.] Well, what is it?\n\nRITA. [Looking up at him with a veiled glow in her eyes.] When I got\nyour telegram yesterday evening--\n\nALLMERS. Yes? What then?\n\nRITA.--then I dressed myself in white--\n\nALLMERS. Yes, I noticed you were in white when I arrived.\n\nRITA. I had let down my hair--\n\nALLMERS. Your sweet masses of hair--\n\nRITA.--so that it flowed down my neck and shoulders--\n\nALLMERS. I saw it, I saw it. Oh, how lovely you were, Rita!\n\nRITA. There were rose-tinted shades over both the lamps. And we were\nalone, we two--the only waking beings in the whole house. And there was\nchampagne on the table.\n\nALLMERS. I did not drink any of it.\n\nRITA. [Looking bitterly at him.] No, that is true. [Laughs harshly.]\n\"There stood the champagne, but you tasted it not\"--as the poet says.\n\n[She rises from the armchair, goes with an air of weariness over to the\nsofa, and seats herself, half reclining, upon it.]\n\nALLMERS. [Crosses the room and stands before her.] I was so taken up\nwith serious thoughts. I had made up my mind to talk to you of our\nfuture, Rita--and first and foremost of Eyolf.\n\nRITA. [Smiling.] And so you did--\n\nALLMERS. No, I had not time to--for you began to undress.\n\nRITA. Yes, and meanwhile you talked about Eyolf. Don't you remember? You\nwanted to know all about little Eyolf's digestion.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking reproachfully at her.] Rita--!\n\nRITA. And then you got into your bed, and slept the sleep of the just.\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] Rita--Rita!\n\nRITA. [Lying at full length and looking up at him.] Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. Yes?\n\nRITA. \"There stood your champagne, but you tasted it not.\"\n\nALLMERS. [Almost harshly.] No. I did not taste it.\n\n[He goes away from her and stands in the garden doorway. RITA lies for\nsome time motionless, with closed eyes.]\n\nRITA. [Suddenly springing up.] But let me tell you one thing, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Turning in the doorway.] Well?\n\nRITA. You ought not to feel quite so secure as you do!\n\nALLMERS. Not secure?\n\nRITA. No, you ought not to be so indifferent! Not certain of your\nproperty in me!\n\nALLMERS. [Drawing nearer.] What do you mean by that?\n\nRITA. [With trembling lips.] Never in a single thought have I been\nuntrue to you, Alfred! Never for an instant.\n\nALLMERS. No, Rita, I know that--I, who know you so well.\n\nRITA. [With sparkling eyes.] But if you disdain me--!\n\nALLMERS. Disdain! I don't understand what you mean!\n\nRITA. Oh, you don't know all that might rise up within me, if--\n\nALLMERS. If?\n\nRITA. If I should ever see that you did not care for me--that you did\nnot love me as you used to.\n\nALLMERS. But, my dearest Rita--years bring a certain change with\nthem--and that must one day occur even in us--as in everyone else.\n\nRITA. Never in me! And I will not hear of any change in you either--I\ncould not bear it, Alfred. I want to keep you to myself alone.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking at her with concern.] You have a terribly jealous\nnature--\n\nRITA. I can't make myself different from what I am. [Threateningly.] If\nyou go and divide yourself between me and anyone else--\n\nALLMERS. What then--?\n\nRITA. Then I will take my revenge on you, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. How \"take your revenge\"?\n\nRITA. I don't know how.--Oh yes, I do know, well enough!\n\nALLMERS. Well?\n\nRITA. I will go and throw myself away--\n\nALLMERS. Throw yourself away, do you say?\n\nRITA. Yes, that I will. I'll throw myself straight into the arms of--of\nthe first man that comes in my way--\n\nALLMERS. [Looking tenderly at her and shaking his head.] That you will\nnever do--my loyal, proud, true-hearted Rita!\n\nRITA. [Putting her arms round his neck.] Oh, you don't know what I might\ncome to be if you--if you did not love me any more.\n\nALLMERS. Did not love you, Rita? How can you say such a thing!\n\nRITA. [Half laughing, lets him go.] Why should I not spread my nets for\nthat--that road-maker man that hangs about here?\n\nALLMERS. [Relieved.] Oh, thank goodness--you are only joking.\n\nRITA. Not at all. He would do as well as anyone else.\n\nALLMERS. Ah, but I suspect he is more or less taken up already.\n\nRITA. So much the better! For then I should take him away from someone\nelse; and that is just what Eyolf has done to me.\n\nALLMERS. Can you say that our little Eyolf has done that?\n\nRITA. [Pointing with her forefinger.] There, you see! You see! The\nmoment you mention Eyolf's name, you grow tender and your voice quivers!\n[Threateningly, clenching her hands.] Oh, you almost tempt me to wish--\n\nALLMERS. [Looking at her anxiously.] What do I tempt you to wish,\nRita?--\n\nRITA. [Vehemently, going away from him.] No, no, no--I won't tell you\nthat! Never!\n\nALLMERS. [Drawing nearer to her.] Rita! I implore you--for my sake and\nfor your own--do not let yourself be tempted into evil.\n\n[BORGHEIM and ASTA come up from the garden. They both show signs of\nrestrained emotion. They look serious and dejected. ASTA remains out on\nthe verandah. BORGHEIM comes into the room.]\n\nBORGHEIM. So that is over--Miss Allmers and I have had our last walk\ntogether.\n\nRITA. [Looks at him with surprise.] Ah! And there is no longer journey\nto follow the walk?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, for me.\n\nRITA. For you alone?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, for me alone.\n\nRITA. [Glances darkly at ALLMERS.] Do you hear that? [Turns to\nBORGHEIM.] I'll wager it is someone with the evil eye that has played\nyou this trick.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Looks at her.] The evil eye?\n\nRITA. [Nodding.] Yes, the evil eye.\n\nBORGHEIM. Do you believe in the evil eye, Mrs. Allmers?\n\nRITA. Yes. I have begun to believe in the evil eye. Especially in a\nchild's evil eye.\n\nALLMERS. [Shocked, whispers.] Rita--how can you--?\n\nRITA. [Speaking low.] It is you that make me so wicked and hateful,\nAlfred.\n\n[Confused cries and shrieks are heard in the distance, from the\ndirection of the fiord.]\n\nBORGHEIM. [Going to the glass door.] What noise is that?\n\nASTA. [In the doorway.] Look at all those people running down to the\npier!\n\nALLMERS. What can it be? [Looks out for a moment.] No doubt it's those\nstreet urchins at some mischief again.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Calls, leaning over the verandah railings.] I say, you boys\ndown there! What's the matter?\n\n[Several voices are heard answering indistinctly and confusedly.]\n\nRITA. What do they say?\n\nBORGHEIM. They say it's a child that's drowned.\n\nALLMERS. A child drowned?\n\nASTA. [Uneasily.] A little boy, they say.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, they can all swim, every one of them.\n\nRITA. [Shrieks in terror.] Where is Eyolf?\n\nALLMERS. Keep quiet--quiet. Eyolf is down in the garden, playing.\n\nASTA. No, he wasn't in the garden.\n\nRITA. [With upstretched arms.] Oh, if only it isn't he!\n\nBORGHEIM. [Listens, and calls down.] Whose child is it, do you say?\n\n[Indistinct voices are heard. BORGHEIM and ASTA utter a suppressed cry,\nand rush out through the garden.]\n\nALLMERS. [In an agony of dread.] It isn't Eyolf! It isn't Eyolf, Rita!\n\nRITA. [On the verandah, listening.] Hush! Be quiet! Let me hear what\nthey are saying!\n\n[RITA rushes back with a piercing shriek, into the room.]\n\nALLMERS. [Following her.] What did they say?\n\nRITA. [Sinking down beside the armchair on the left.] They said: \"The\ncrutch is floating!\"\n\nALLMERS. [Almost paralysed.] No! No! No!\n\nRITA. [Hoarsely.] Eyolf! Eyolf! Oh, but they must save him!\n\nALLMERS. [Half distracted.] They must, they must! So precious a life!\n\n[He rushes down through the garden.]\n\n\n\n\nACT SECOND\n\n[A little narrow glen by the side of the fiord, on ALLMERS'S property.\nOn the left, lofty old trees overarch the spot. Down the slope in the\nbackground a brook comes leaping, and loses itself among the stones on\nthe margin of the wood. A path winds along by the brook-side. To the\nright there are only a few single trees, between which the fiord is\nvisible. In front is seen the corner of a boat-shed with a boat drawn\nup. Under the old trees on the left stands a table with a bench and one\nor two chairs, all made of thin birch-staves. It is a heavy, damp day,\nwith driving mist wreaths.]\n\n[ALFRED ALLMERS, dressed as before, sits on the bench, leaning his arms\non the table. His hat lies before him. He gazes absently and immovably\nout over the water.]\n\n[Presently ASTA ALLMERS comes down the woodpath. She is carrying an open\numbrella.]\n\nASTA. [Goes quietly and cautiously up to him.] You ought not to sit down\nhere in this gloomy weather, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Nods slowly without answering.]\n\nASTA. [Closing her umbrella.] I have been searching for you such a long\ntime.\n\nALLMERS. [Without expression.] Thank you.\n\nASTA. [Moves a chair and seats herself close to him.] Have you been\nsitting here long? All the time?\n\nALLMERS. [Does not answer at first. Presently he says.] No, I cannot\ngrasp it. It seems so utterly impossible.\n\nASTA. [Laying her hand compassionately on his arm.] Poor Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. [Gazing at her.] Is it really true then, Asta? Or have I gone\nmad? Or am I only dreaming? Oh, if it were only a dream! Just think, if\nI were to waken now!\n\nASTA. Oh, if I could only waken you!\n\nALLMERS. [Looking out over the water.] How pitiless the fiord looks\nto-day, lying so heavy and drowsy--leaden-grey--with splashes of\nyellow--and reflecting the rain-clouds.\n\nASTA. [Imploringly.] Oh, Alfred, don't sit staring out over the fiord!\n\nALLMERS. [Not heeding her.] Over the surface, yes. But in the\ndepths--there sweeps the rushing undertow--\n\nASTA. [In terror.] Oh, for God's sake don't think of the depths!\n\nALLMERS. [Looking gently at her.] I suppose you think he is lying close\noutside here? But he is not, Asta. You must not think that. You must\nremember how fiercely the current sweeps out here straight to the open\nsea.\n\nASTA. [Throws herself forward against the table, and, sobbing, buries\nher face in her hands.] Oh, God! Oh, God!\n\nALLMERS. [Heavily.] So you see, little Eyolf has passed so far--far away\nfrom us now.\n\nASTA. [Looks imploringly up at him.] Oh, Alfred, don't say such things!\n\nALLMERS. Why, you can reckon it out for yourself--you that are so\nclever. In eight-and-twenty hours--nine-and-twenty hours--Let me see--!\nLet me see--!\n\nASTA. [Shrieking and stopping her ears.] Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. [Clenching his hand firmly upon the table.] Can you conceive\nthe meaning of a thing like this?\n\nASTA. [Looks at him.] Of what?\n\nALLMERS. Of this that has been done to Rita and me.\n\nASTA. The meaning of it?\n\nALLMERS. [Impatiently.] Yes, the meaning, I say. For, after all, there\nmust be a meaning in it. Life, existence--destiny, cannot be so utterly\nmeaningless.\n\nASTA. Oh, who can say anything with certainty about these things, my\ndear Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Laughs bitterly.] No, no; I believe you are right there.\nPerhaps the whole thing goes simply by hap-hazard--taking its own\ncourse, like a drifting wreck without a rudder. I daresay that is how it\nis. At least, it seems very like it.\n\nASTA. [Thoughtfully.] What if it only seems--?\n\nALLMERS. [Vehemently.] Ah? Perhaps you can unravel the mystery for me?\nI certainly cannot. [More gently.] Here is Eyolf, just entering\nupon conscious life: full of such infinite possibilities--splendid\npossibilities perhaps: he would have filled my life with pride and\ngladness. And then a crazy old woman has only to come this way--and show\na cur in a bag--\n\nASTA. But we don't in the least know how it really happened.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, we do. The boys saw her row out over the fiord. They saw\nEyolf standing alone at the very end of the pier. They saw him gazing\nafter her--and then he seemed to turn giddy. [Quivering.] And that was\nhow he fell over--and disappeared.\n\nASTA. Yes, yes. But all the same--\n\nALLMERS. She has drawn him down into the depths--that you may be sure\nof, dear.\n\nASTA. But, Alfred, why should she?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, that is just the question! Why should she? There is no\nretribution behind it all--no atonement, I mean. Eyolf never did her any\nharm. He never called names after her; he never threw stones at her dog.\nWhy, he had never set eyes either on her or her dog till yesterday.\nSo there is no retribution; the whole thing is utterly groundless and\nmeaningless, Asta.--And yet the order of the world requires it.\n\nASTA. Have you spoken to Rita of these things?\n\nALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] I feel as if I can talk better to you about\nthem. [Drawing a deep breath.] And about everything else as well.\n\n[ASTA takes sewing-materials and a little paper parcel out of her\npocket. ALLMERS sits looking on absently.]\n\nALLMERS. What leave you got there, Asta?\n\nASTA. [Taking his hat.] Some black crape.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, what is the use of that?\n\nASTA. Rita asked me to put it on. May I?\n\nALLMERS. Oh, yes; as far as I'm concerned--[She sews the crape on his\nhat.]\n\nALLMERS. [Sitting and looking at her.] Where is Rita?\n\nASTA. She is walking about the garden a little, I think. Borgheim is\nwith her.\n\nALLMERS. [Slightly surprised.] Indeed! Is Borgheim out here to-day\nagain?\n\nASTA. Yes. He came out by the mid-day train.\n\nALLMERS. I didn't expect that.\n\nASTA. [Serving.] He was so fond of Eyolf.\n\nALLMERS. Borgheim is a faithful soul, Asta.\n\nASTA. [With quiet warmth.] Yes, faithful he is, indeed. That is certain.\n\nALLMERS. [Fixing his eyes upon her.] You are really fond of him?\n\nASTA. Yes, I am.\n\nALLMERS. And yet you cannot make up your mind to--?\n\nASTA. [Interrupting.] Oh, my dear Alfred, don't talk of that!\n\nALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me why you cannot?\n\nASTA. Oh, no! Please! You really must not ask me. You see, it's so\npainful for me.--There now! The hat is done.\n\nALLMERS. Thank you.\n\nASTA. And now for the left arm.\n\nALLMERS. Am I to have crape on it too?\n\nASTA. Yes, that is the custom.\n\nALLMERS. Well--as you please.\n\n[She moves close up to him and begins to sew.]\n\nASTA. Keep your arm still--then I won't prick you.\n\nALLMERS. [With a half-smile.] This is like the old days.\n\nASTA. Yes, don't you think so?\n\nALLMERS. When you were a little girl you used to sit just like this,\nmending my clothes. The first thing you ever sewed for me--that was\nblack crape, too.\n\nASTA. Was it?\n\nALLMERS. Round my student's cap--at the time of father's death.\n\nASTA. Could I sew then? Fancy, I have forgotten it.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, you were such a little thing then.\n\nASTA. Yes, I was little then.\n\nALLMERS. And then, two years afterwards--when we lost your mother--then\nagain you sewed a big crape band on my sleeve.\n\nASTA. I thought it was the right thing to do.\n\nALLMERS. [Patting her hand.] Yes, yes, it was the right thing to do,\nAsta. And then when we were left alone in the world, we two--. Are you\ndone already?\n\nASTA. Yes. [Putting together her sewing-materials.] It was really a\nbeautiful time for us, Alfred. We two alone.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, it was--though we had to toil so hard.\n\nASTA. You toiled.\n\nALLMERS. [With more life.] Oh, you toiled too, in your way, I can assure\nyou--[smiling]--my dear, faithful--Eyolf.\n\nASTA. Oh--you mustn't remind me of that stupid nonsense about the name.\n\nALLMERS. Well, if you had been a boy, you would have been called Eyolf.\n\nASTA. Yes, if! But when you began to go to college--. [Smiling\ninvoluntarily.] I wonder how you could be so childish.\n\nALLMERS. Was it I that was childish?\n\nASTA. Yes, indeed, I think it was, as I look back upon it all. You were\nashamed of having no brother--only a sister.\n\nALLMERS. No, no, it was you, dear--you were ashamed.\n\nASTA. Oh yes, I too, perhaps--a little. And somehow or other I was sorry\nfor you--\n\nALLMERS. Yes, I believe you were. And then you hunted up some of my old\nboy's clothes--\n\nASTA. Your fine Sunday clothes--yes. Do you remember the blue blouse and\nknickerbockers?\n\nALLMERS. [His eyes dwelling upon her.] I remember so well how you looked\nwhen you used to wear them.\n\nASTA. Only when we were at home, alone, though.\n\nALLMERS. And how serious we were, dear, and how mightily pleased with\nourselves. I always called you Eyolf.\n\nASTA. Oh, Alfred, I hope you have never told Rita this?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, I believe I did once tell her.\n\nASTA. Oh, Alfred, how could you do that?\n\nALLMERS. Well, you see--one tells one's wife everything--very nearly.\n\nASTA. Yes, I suppose one does.\n\nALLMERS. [As if awakening, clutches at his forehead and starts up.] Oh,\nhow can I sit here and--\n\nASTA. [Rising, looks sorrowfully at him.] What is the matter?\n\nALLMERS. He had almost passed away from me. He had passed quite away.\n\nASTA. Eyolf!\n\nALLMERS. Here I sat, living in these recollections--and he had no part\nin them.\n\nASTA. Yes, Alfred--little Eyolf was behind it all.\n\nALLMERS. No, he was not. He slipped out of my memory--out of my\nthoughts. I did not see him for a moment as we sat here talking. I\nutterly forgot him all that time.\n\nASTA. But surely you must take some rest in your sorrow.\n\nALLMERS. No, no, no; that is just what I will not do! I must not--I\nhave no right--and no heart for it, either. [Going in great excitement\ntowards the right.] All my thoughts must be out there, where he lies\ndrifting in the depths!\n\nASTA. [Following him and holding him back.] Alfred--Alfred! Don't go to\nthe fiord.\n\nALLMERS. I must go out to him! Let me go, Asta! I will take the boat.\n\nASTA. [In terror.] Don't go to the fiord, I say!\n\nALLMERS. [Yielding.] No, no--I will not. Only let me alone.\n\nASTA. [Leading him back to the table.] You must rest from your thoughts,\nAlfred. Come here and sit down.\n\nALLMERS. [Making as if to seat himself on the bench.] Well, well--as you\nplease.\n\nASTA. No, I won't let you sit there.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, let me.\n\nASTA. No, don't. For then you will only sit looking out--[Forces him\ndown upon a chair, with his back to the right.] There now. Now that's\nright. [Seats herself upon the bench.] And now we can talk a little\nagain.\n\nALLMERS. [Drawing a deep breath audibly.] It was good to deaden the\nsorrow and heartache for a moment.\n\nASTA. You must do so, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. But don't you think it is terribly weak and unfeeling of me--to\nbe able to do so?\n\nASTA. Oh, no--I am sure it is impossible to keep circling for ever round\none fixed thought.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, for me it is impossible. Before you came to me, here I\nsat, torturing myself unspeakably with this crushing, gnawing sorrow--\n\nASTA. Yes?\n\nALLMERS. And would you believe it, Asta--? H'm--\n\nASTA. Well?\n\nALLMERS. In the midst of all the agony, I found myself speculating what\nwe should have for dinner to-day.\n\nASTA. [Soothingly.] Well, well, if only it rests you to--\n\nALLMERS. Yes, just fancy, dear--it seemed as if it did give me rest.\n[Holds out, his hand to her across the table.] How good it is, Asta,\nthat I have you with me. I am so glad of that. Glad, glad--even in my\nsorrow.\n\nASTA. [Looking earnestly at him.] You ought most of all to be glad that\nyou have Rita.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, of course I should. But Rita is no kin to me--it isn't\nlike having a sister.\n\nASTA. [Eagerly.] Do you say that, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. Yes, our family is a thing apart. [Half jestingly.] We have\nalways had vowels for our initials. Don't you remember how often we used\nto speak of that? And all our relations--all equally poor. And we have\nall the same colour of eyes.\n\nASTA. Do you think I have--?\n\nALLMERS. No, you take entirely after your mother. You are not in the\nleast like the rest of us--not even like father. But all the same--\n\nASTA. All the same--?\n\nALLMERS. Well, I believe that living together has, as it were, stamped\nus in each other's image--mentally, I mean.\n\nASTA. [With warm emotion.] Oh, you must never say that, Alfred. It is\nonly I that have taken my stamp from you; and it is to you that I owe\neverything--every good thing in the world.\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] You owe me nothing, Asta. On the contrary--\n\nASTA. I owe you everything! You must never doubt that. No sacrifice has\nbeen too great for you--\n\nALLMERS. [Interrupting.] Oh, nonsense--sacrifice! Don't talk of such a\nthing.--I have only loved you, Asta, ever since you were a little child.\n[After a short pause.] And then it always seemed to me that I had so\nmuch injustice to make up to you for.\n\nASTA. [Astonished.] Injustice? You?\n\nALLMERS. Not precisely on my own account. But--\n\nASTA. [Eagerly.] But--?\n\nALLMERS. On father's.\n\nASTA. [Half rising from the bench.] On--father's! [Sitting down again.]\nWhat do you mean by that, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. Father was never really kind to you.\n\nASTA. [Vehemently.] Oh, don't say that!\n\nALLMERS. Yes, it is true. He did not love you--not as he ought to have.\n\nASTA. [Evasively.] No, perhaps not as he loved you. That was only\nnatural.\n\nALLMERS. [Continuing.] And he was often hard to your mother, too--at\nleast in the last years.\n\nASTA. [Softly.] Mother was so much, much younger than he--remember that.\n\nALLMERS. Do you think they were not quite suited to each other?\n\nASTA. Perhaps not.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, but still--. Father, who in other ways was so gentle and\nwarm-hearted--so kindly towards everyone--\n\nASTA. [Quietly.] Mother, too, was not always as she ought to have been.\n\nALLMERS. Your mother was not!\n\nASTA. Perhaps not always.\n\nALLMERS. Towards father, do you mean?\n\nASTA. Yes.\n\nALLMERS. I never noticed that.\n\nASTA. [Struggling with her tears, rises.] Oh, my dear Alfred--let them\nrest--those who are gone. [She goes towards the right.]\n\nALLMERS. [Rising.] Yes, let them rest. [Wringing his hands.] But those\nwho are gone--it is they that won't let us rest, Asta. Neither day nor\nnight.\n\nASTA. [Looks warmly at him.] Time will make it all seem easier, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking helplessly at her.] Yes, don't you think it will?--But\nhow I am to get over these terrible first days [Hoarsely.]--that is what\nI cannot imagine.\n\nASTA. [Imploringly, laying her hands on his shoulders.] Go up to Rita.\nOh, please do--\n\nALLMERS. [Vehemently, withdrawing from her.] No, no, no--don't talk to\nme of that! I cannot, I tell you. [More calmly.] Let me remain here,\nwith you.\n\nASTA. Well, I will not leave you.\n\nALLMERS. [Seizing her hand and holding it fast.] Thank you for that!\n[Looks out for a time over the fiord.] Where is my little Eyolf now?\n[Smiling sadly to her.] Can you tell me that my big, wise Eyolf?\n[Shaking his head.] No one in all the world can tell me that. I know\nonly this one terrible thing--that he is gone from me.\n\nASTA. [Looking up to the left, and withdrawing her hand.] Here they are\ncoming.\n\n[MRS. ALLMERS and Engineer BORGHEIM come down by the wood-path, she\nleading the way. She wears a dark dress and a black veil over her head.\nHe has an umbrella under his arm.]\n\nALLMERS. [Going to meet her.] How is it with you, Rita?\n\nRITA. [Passing him.] Oh, don't ask.\n\nALLMERS. Why do you come here?\n\nRITA. Only to look for you. What are you doing?\n\nALLMERS. Nothing. Asta came down to me.\n\nRITA. Yes, but before Asta came? You have been away from me all the\nmorning.\n\nALLMERS. I have been sitting here looking out over the water.\n\nRITA. Ugh,--how can you?\n\nALLMERS. [Impatiently.] I like best to be alone now.\n\nRITA. [Moving restlessly about.] And then to sit still! To stay in one\nplace!\n\nALLMERS. I have nothing in the world to move for.\n\nRITA. I cannot bear to be anywhere long. Least of all here--with the\nfiord at my very feet.\n\nALLMERS. It is just the nearness of the fiord--\n\nRITA. [To BORGHEIM.] Don't you think he should come back with the rest\nof us?\n\nBORGHEIM. [To ALLMERS.] I believe it would be better for you.\n\nALLMERS. No, no; let me stay where I am.\n\nRITA. Then I will stay with you, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. Very well; do so, then. You remain too, Asta.\n\nASTA. [Whispers to BORGHEIM.] Let us leave them alone!\n\nBORGHEIM. [With a glance of comprehension.] Miss Allmers, shall we go a\nlittle further--along the shore? For the very last time?\n\nASTA. [Taking her umbrella.] Yes, come. Let us go a little further.\n\n[ASTA and BORGHEIM go out together behind the boat-shed. ALLMERS wanders\nabout for a little. Then he seats himself on a stone under the trees on\nthe left.]\n\nRITA. [Comes up and stands before him, her hands folded and hanging\ndown.] Can you think the thought, Alfred--that we have lost Eyolf?\n\nALLMERS. [Looking sadly at the ground.] We must accustom ourselves to\nthink it.\n\nRITA. I cannot. I cannot. And then that horrible sight that will haunt\nme all my life long.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking up.] What sight? What have you seen?\n\nRITA. I have seen nothing myself. I have only heard it told. Oh--!\n\nALLMERS. You may as well tell me at once.\n\nRITA. I got Borgheim to go down with me to the pier--\n\nALLMERS. What did you want there?\n\nRITA. To question the boys as to how it happened.\n\nALLMERS. But we know that.\n\nRITA. We got to know more.\n\nALLMERS. Well?\n\nRITA. It is not true that he disappeared all at once.\n\nALLMERS. Do they say that now?\n\nRITA. Yes. They say they saw him lying down on the bottom. Deep down in\nthe clear water.\n\nALLMERS. [Grinding his teeth.] And they didn't save him!\n\nRITA. I suppose they could not.\n\nALLMERS. They could swim--every one of them. Did they tell you how he\nwas lying whilst they could see him?\n\nRITA. Yes. They said he was lying on his back. And with great, open\neyes.\n\nALLMERS. Open eyes. But quite still?\n\nRITA. Yes, quite still. And then something came and swept him away. They\ncalled it the undertow.\n\nALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] So that was the last they saw of him.\n\nRITA. [Suffocated with tears.] Yes.\n\nALLMERS. [In a dull voice.] And never--never will anyone see him again.\n\nRITA. [Wailing.] I shall see him day and night, as he lay down there.\n\nALLMERS. With great, open eyes.\n\nRITA. [Shuddering.] Yes, with great, open eyes. I see them! I see them\nnow!\n\nALLMERS. [Rises slowly and looks with quiet menace at her.] Were they\nevil, those eyes, Rita?\n\nRITA. [Turning pale.] Evil--!\n\nALLMERS. [Going close up to her.] Were they evil eyes that stared up? Up\nfrom the depths?\n\nRITA. [Shrinking from him.] Alfred--!\n\nALLMERS. [Following her.] Answer me! Were they a child's evil eyes?\n\nRITA. [Shrieks.] Alfred! Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. Now things have come about--just as you wished, Rita.\n\nRITA. I! What did I wish?\n\nALLMERS. That Eyolf were not here.\n\nRITA. Never for a moment have I wished that! That Eyolf should not stand\nbetween us--that was what I wished.\n\nALLMERS. Well, well--he does not stand between us any more.\n\nRITA. [Softly, gazing straight before her.] Perhaps now more than ever.\n[With a sudden shudder.] Oh, that horrible sight!\n\nALLMERS. [Nods.] The child's evil eyes.\n\nRITA. [In dread, recoiling from him.] Let me be, Alfred! I am afraid of\nyou. I have never seen you like this before.\n\nALLMERS. [Looks harshly and coldly at her.] Sorrow makes us wicked and\nhateful.\n\nRITA. [Terrified, and yet defiant.] That is what I feel, too.\n\n[ALLMERS goes towards the right and looks out over the fiord. RITA seats\nherself at the table. A short pause.]\n\nALLMERS. [Turning his head towards her.] You never really and truly\nloved him--never!\n\nRITA. [With cold self-control.] Eyolf would never let me take him really\nand truly to my heart.\n\nALLMERS. Because you did not want to.\n\nRITA. Oh yes, I did. I did want to. But someone stood in the way--even\nfrom the first.\n\nALLMERS. [Turning right round.] Do you mean that _I_ stood in the way?\n\nRITA. Oh, no--not at first.\n\nALLMERS. [Coming nearer her.] Who, then?\n\nRITA. His aunt.\n\nALLMERS. Asta?\n\nRITA. Yes. Asta stood and barred the way for me.\n\nALLMERS. Can you say that, Rita?\n\nRITA. Yes. Asta--she took him to her heart--from the moment that\nhappened--that miserable fall.\n\nALLMERS. If she did so, she did it in love.\n\nRITA. [Vehemently.] That is just it! I cannot endure to share anything\nwith anyone! Not in love.\n\nALLMERS. We two should have shared him between us in love.\n\nRITA. [Looking scornfully at him.] We? Oh, the truth is you have never\nhad any real love for him either.\n\nALLMERS. [Looks at her in astonishment.] _I_ have not--!\n\nRITA. No, you have not. At first you were so utterly taken up by that\nbook of yours--about Responsibility.\n\nALLMERS. [Forcibly.] Yes, I was. But my very book--I sacrificed for\nEyolf's sake.\n\nRITA. Not out of love for him.\n\nALLMERS. Why then, do you suppose?\n\nRITA. Because you were consumed with mistrust of yourself. Because you\nhad begun to doubt whether you had any great vocation to live for in the\nworld.\n\nALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] Could you see that in me?\n\nRITA. Oh, yes--little by little. And then you needed something new to\nfill up your life.--It seems _I_ was not enough for you any longer.\n\nALLMERS. That is the law of change, Rita.\n\nRITA. And that was why you wanted to make a prodigy of poor little\nEyolf.\n\nALLMERS. That was not what I wanted. I wanted to make a happy human\nbeing of him.--That, and nothing more.\n\nRITA. But not out of love for him. Look into yourself! [With a certain\nshyness of expression.] Search out all that lies under--and behind your\naction.\n\nALLMERS. [Avoiding her eyes.] There is something you shrink from saying.\n\nRITA. And you too.\n\nALLMERS. [Looks thoughtfully at her.] If it is as you say, then we two\nhave never really possessed our own child.\n\nRITA. No. Not in perfect love.\n\nALLMERS. And yet we are sorrowing so bitterly for him.\n\nRITA. [With sarcasm.] Yes, isn't it curious that we should grieve like\nthis over a little stranger boy?\n\nALLMERS. [With an outburst.] Oh, don't call him a stranger!\n\nRITA. [Sadly shaking her head.] We never won the boy, Alfred. Not I--nor\nyou either.\n\nALLMERS. [Wringing his hands.] And now it is too late! Too late!\n\nRITA. And no consolation anywhere--in anything.\n\nALLMERS. [With sudden passion.] You are the guilty one in this!\n\nRITA. [Rising.] I!\n\nALLMERS. Yes, you! It was your fault that he became--what he was! It was\nyour fault that he could not save himself when he fell into the water.\n\nRITA. [With a gesture of repulsion.] Alfred--you shall not throw the\nblame upon me!\n\nALLMERS. [More and more beside himself.] Yes, yes, I do! It was you that\nleft the helpless child unwatched upon the table.\n\nRITA. He was lying so comfortably among the cushions, and sleeping so\nsoundly. And you had promised to look after him.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, I had. [Lowering his voice.] But then you came--you, you,\nyou--and lured me to you.\n\nRITA. [Looking defiantly at him.] Oh, better own at once that you forgot\nthe child and everything else.\n\nALLMERS. [In suppressed desperation.] Yes, that is true. [Lower.] I\nforgot the child--in your arms!\n\nRITA. [Exasperated.] Alfred! Alfred--this is intolerable of you!\n\nALLMERS. [In a low voice, clenching his fists before her face.] In that\nhour you condemned little Eyolf to death.\n\nRITA. [Wildly.] You, too! You, too--if it is as you say!\n\nALLMERS. Oh yes--call me to account, too--if you will. We have sinned,\nboth of us. And so, after all, there was retribution in Eyolf's death.\n\nRITA. Retribution?\n\nALLMERS. [With more self-control.] Yes. Judgment upon you and me. Now,\nas we stand here, we have our deserts. While he lived, we let ourselves\nshrink away from him in secret, abject remorse. We could not bear to see\nit--the thing he had to drag with him--\n\nRITA. [Whispers.] The crutch.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, that. And now, what we now call sorrow and heartache--is\nreally the gnawing of conscience, Rita. Nothing else.\n\nRITA. [Gazing helplessly at him.] I feel as if all this must end in\ndespair--in madness for both of us. For we can never--never make it good\nagain.\n\nALLMERS. [Passing into a calmer mood.] I dreamed about Eyolf last night.\nI thought I saw him coming up from the pier. He could run like other\nboys. So nothing had happened to him--neither the one thing nor the\nother. And the torturing reality was nothing but a dream, I thought. Oh,\nhow I thanked and blessed--[Checking himself.] H'm!\n\nRITA. [Looking at him.] Whom?\n\nALLMERS. [Evasively.] Whom--?\n\nRITA. Yes; whom did you thank and bless?\n\nALLMERS. [Putting aside the question.] I was only dreaming, you know--\n\nRITA. One whom you yourself do not believe in?\n\nALLMERS. That was how I felt, all the same. Of course, I was sleeping--\n\nRITA. [Reproachfully.] You should not have taught me to doubt, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. Would it have been right of me to let you go through life with\nyour mind full of empty fictions?\n\nRITA. It would have been better for me; for then I should have had\nsomething to take refuge in. Now I am utterly at sea.\n\nALLMERS. [Observing her closely.] If you had the choice now--. If you\ncould follow Eyolf to where he is--?\n\nRITA. Yes? What then?\n\nALLMERS. If you were fully assured that you would find him again--know\nhim--understand him--?\n\nRITA. Yes, yes; what then?\n\nALLMERS. Would you, of your own free will, take the leap over to him?\nOf your own free will leave everything behind you? Renounce your whole\nearthly life? Would you, Rita?\n\nRITA. [Softly.] Now, at once?\n\nALLMERS. Yes; to-day. This very hour. Answer me--would you?\n\nRITA. [Hesitating.] Oh, I don't know, Alfred. No! I think I should have\nto stay here with you, a little while.\n\nALLMERS. For my sake?\n\nRITA. Yes. Only for your sake.\n\nALLMERS. And afterwards? Would you then--? Answer!\n\nRITA. Oh, what can I answer? I could not go away from you. Never! Never!\n\nALLMERS. But suppose now _I_ went to Eyolf? And you had the fullest\nassurance that you would meet both him and me there. Then would you come\nover to us?\n\nRITA. I should want to--so much! so much! But--\n\nALLMERS. Well? I I?\n\nRITA. [Moaning softly.] I could not--I feel it. No, no, I never could!\nNot for all the glory of heaven!\n\nALLMERS. Nor I.\n\nRITA. No, you feel it so, too, don't you, Alfred! You could not either,\ncould you?\n\nALLMERS. No. For it is here, in the life of earth, that we living beings\nare at home.\n\nRITA. Yes, here lies the kind of happiness that we can understand.\n\nALLMERS. [Darkly.] Oh, happiness--happiness--\n\nRITA. You mean that happiness--that we can never find it again? [Looks\ninquiringly at him.] But if--? [Vehemently.] No, no; I dare not say it!\nNor even think it!\n\nALLMERS. Yes, say it--say it, Rita.\n\nRITA. [Hesitatingly.] Could we not try to--? Would it not be possible to\nforget him?\n\nALLMERS. Forget Eyolf?\n\nRITA. Forget the anguish and remorse, I mean.\n\nALLMERS. Can you wish it?\n\nRITA. Yes,--if it were possible. [With an outburst.] For this--I cannot\nbear this for ever! Oh, can we not think of something that will bring\nits forgetfulness!\n\nALLMERS. [Shakes his head.] What could that be?\n\nRITA. Could we not see what travelling would do--far away from here?\n\nALLMERS. From home? When you know you are never really well anywhere but\nhere.\n\nRITA. Well, then, let us have crowds of people about us! Keep open\nhouse! Plunge into something that can deaden and dull our thoughts!\n\nALLMERS. Such a life would be impossible for me.--No,--rather than\nthat, I would try to take up my work again.\n\nRITA. [Bitingly.] Your work--the work that has always stood like a dead\nwall between us!\n\nALLMERS. [Slowly, looking fixedly at her.] There must always be a dead\nwall between us two, from this time forth.\n\nRITA. Why must there--?\n\nALLMERS. Who knows but that a child's great, open eyes are watching us\nday and night.\n\nRITA. [Softly, shuddering.] Alfred--how terrible to think of!\n\nALLMERS. Our love has been like a consuming fire. Now it must be\nquenched--\n\nRITA. [With a movement towards him.] Quenched!\n\nALLMERS. [Hardly.] It is quenched--in one of us.\n\nRITA. [As if petrified.] And you dare say that to me!\n\nALLMERS. [More gently.] It is dead, Rita. But in what I now feel for\nyou--in our common guilt and need of atonement--I seem to foresee a sort\nof resurrection--\n\nRITA. [Vehemently.] I don't care a bit about any resurrection!\n\nALLMERS. Rita!\n\nRITA. I am a warm-blooded being! I don't go drowsing about--with fishes'\nblood in my veins. [Wringing her hands.] And now to be imprisoned for\nlife--in anguish and remorse! Imprisoned with one who is no longer mine,\nmine, mine!\n\nALLMERS. It must have ended so, sometime, Rita.\n\nRITA. Must have ended so! The love that in the beginning rushed forth so\neagerly to meet with love!\n\nALLMERS. My love did not rush forth to you in the beginning.\n\nRITA. What did you feel for me, first of all?\n\nALLMERS. Dread.\n\nRITA. That I can understand. How was it, then, that I won you after all?\n\nALLMERS. [In a low voice.] You were so entrancingly beautiful, Rita.\n\nRITA. [Looks searchingly at him.] Then that was the only reason? Say it,\nAlfred! The only reason?\n\nALLMERS. [Conquering himself.] No, there was another as well.\n\nRITA. [With an outburst.] I can guess what that was! It was \"my gold,\nand my green forests,\" as you call it. Was it not so, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. Yes.\n\nRITA. [Looks at him with deep reproach.] How could you--how could you!\n\nALLMERS. I had Asta to think of.\n\nRITA. [Angrily.] Yes, Asta! [Bitterly.] Then it was really Asta that\nbrought us two together?\n\nALLMERS. She knew nothing about it. She has no suspicion of it, even to\nthis day.\n\nRITA. [Rejecting the plea.] It was Asta, nevertheless! [Smiling, with a\nsidelong glance of scorn. ] Or, no--it was little Eyolf. Little Eyolf,\nmy dear!\n\nALLMERS. Eyolf--?\n\nRITA. Yes, you used to call her Eyolf, did you not? I seem to remember\nyour telling me so--once, in a moment of confidence. [Coming up to him.]\nDo you remember it--that entrancingly beautiful hour, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Recoiling, as if in horror.] I remember nothing! I will not\nremember!\n\nRITA. [Following him.] It was in that hour--when your other little Eyolf\nwas crippled for life!\n\nALLMERS. [In a hollow voice, supporting himself against the table.]\nRetribution!\n\nRITA. [Menacingly.] Yes, retribution!\n\n[ASTA and BORGHEIM return by way of the boat-shed. She is carrying some\nwater-lilies in her hand.]\n\nRITA. [With self-control.] Well, Asta, have you and Mr. Borgheim talked\nthings thoroughly over?\n\nASTA. Oh, yes--pretty well.\n\n[She puts down her umbrella and lays the flowers upon a chair.]\n\nBORGHEIM. Miss Allmers has been very silent during our walk.\n\nRITA. Indeed, has she? Well, Alfred and I have talked things out\nthoroughly enough--\n\nASTA. [Looking eagerly at both of them.] What is this--?\n\nRITA. Enough to last all our lifetime, I say. [Breaking off.] Come now,\nlet us go up to the house, all four of us. We must have company about us\nin future. It will never do for Alfred and me to be alone.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, do you go ahead, you two. [Turning.] I must speak a word\nto you before we go, Asta.\n\nRITA. [Looking at him.] Indeed? Well then, you come with me, Mr.\nBorgheim.\n\n[RITA and BORGHEIM go up the wood-path.]\n\nASTA. [Anxiously.] Alfred, what is the matter?\n\nALLMERS. [Darkly.] Only that I cannot endure to be here any more.\n\nASTA. Here! With Rita, do you mean?\n\nALLMERS. Yes. Rita and I cannot go on living together.\n\nASTA. [Seizes his arm and shakes it.] Oh, Alfred--don't say anything so\nterrible!\n\nALLMERS. It is the truth. I am telling you. We are making each other\nwicked and hateful.\n\nASTA. [With painful emotion.] I had never--never dreamt of anything like\nthis!\n\nALLMERS. I did not realise it either, till to-day.\n\nASTA. And now you want to--! What is it you really want, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. I want to get away from everything here--far, far away from it\nall.\n\nASTA. And to stand quite alone in the world?\n\nALLMERS. [Nods.] As I used to, before, yes.\n\nASTA. But you are not fitted for living alone!\n\nALLMERS. Oh, yes. I was so in the old days, at any rate.\n\nASTA. In the old days, yes; for then you had me with you.\n\nALLMERS. [Trying to take her hand.] Yes. And it is to you, Asta, that I\nnow want to come home again.\n\nASTA. [Eluding him.] To me! No, no, Alfred! That is quite impossible.\n\nALLMERS. [Looks sadly at her.] Then Borgheim stands in the way after\nall?\n\nASTA. [Earnestly.] No, no; he does not! That is quite a mistake!\n\nALLMERS. Good. Then I will come to you--my dear, dear sister. I must\ncome to you again--home to you, to be purified and ennobled after my\nlife with--\n\nASTA. [Shocked.] Alfred,--you are doing Rita a great wrong!\n\nALLMERS. I have done her a great wrong. But not in this. Oh, think of\nit, Asta--think of our life together, yours and mine. Was it not like\none long holy-day from first to last?\n\nASTA. Yes, it was, Alfred. But we can never live it over again.\n\nALLMERS. [Bitterly.] Do you mean that marriage has so irreparably ruined\nme?\n\nASTA. [Quietly.] No, that is not what I mean.\n\nALLMERS. Well, then we two will live our old life over again.\n\nASTA. [With decision.] We cannot, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, we can. For the love of a brother and sister--\n\nASTA. [Eagerly.] What of it?\n\nALLMERS. That is the only relation in life that is not subject to the\nlaw of change.\n\nASTA. [Softly and tremblingly.] But if that relation were not--\n\nALLMERS. Not--?\n\nASTA.--not our relation?\n\nALLMERS. [Stares at her in astonishment.] Not ours? Why, what can you\nmean by that?\n\nASTA. It is best I should tell you at once, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, yes; tell me!\n\nASTA. The letters to mother--. Those in my portfolio--\n\nALLMERS. Well?\n\nASTA. You must read them--when I am gone.\n\nALLMERS. Why must I?\n\nASTA. [Struggling with herself.] For then you will see that--\n\nALLMERS. Well?\n\nASTA.--that I have no right to bear your father's name.\n\nALLMERS. [Staggering backwards.] Asta! What is this you say!\n\nASTA. Read the letters. Then you will see--and understand. And perhaps\nhave some forgiveness--for mother, too.\n\nALLMERS. [Clutching at his forehead.] I cannot grasp this--I cannot\nrealise the thought. You, Asta--you are not--\n\nASTA. You are not my brother, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Quickly, half defiantly, looking at her.] Well, but what\ndifference does that really make in our relation? Practically none at\nall.\n\nASTA. [Shaking her head.] It makes all the difference, Alfred. Our\nrelation is not that of brother and sister.\n\nALLMERS. No, no. But it is none the less sacred for that--it will always\nbe equally sacred.\n\nASTA. Do not forget--that it is subject to the law of change, as you\nsaid just now.\n\nALLMERS. [Looks inquiringly at her.] Do you mean that--\n\nASTA. [Quietly, but with warm emotion.] Not a word more--my dear,\ndear Alfred. [Takes up the flowers from the chair.] Do you see these\nwater-lilies?\n\nALLMERS. [Nodding slowly.] They are the sort that shoot up--from the\nvery depth.\n\nASTA. I pulled them in the tarn--where it flows out into the fiord.\n[Holds them out to him.] Will you take them, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Taking them.] Thanks.\n\nASTA. [With tears in her eyes.] They are a last greeting to you,\nfrom--from little Eyolf.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking at her.] From Eyolf out yonder? Or from you?\n\nASTA. [Softly.] From both of us. [Taking up her umbrella.] Now come with\nme to Rita.\n\n[She goes up the wood-path.]\n\nALLMERS. [Takes up his hat from the table, and whispers sadly.] Asta.\nEyolf. Little Eyolf--!\n\n[He follows her up the path.]\n\n\n\n\nACT THIRD\n\n[An elevation, overgrown with shrubs, in ALLMERS'S garden. At the back\na sheer cliff, with a railing along its edge, and with steps on the left\nleading downwards. An extensive view over the fiord, which lies deep\nbelow. A flagstaff with lines, but no flag, stands by the railing. In\nfront, on the right, a summer-house, covered with creepers and wild\nvines. Outside it, a bench. It is a late summer evening, with clear sky.\nDeepening twilight.]\n\n[ASTA is sitting on the bench, with her hands in her lap. She is wearing\nher outdoor dress and a hat, has her parasol at her side, and a little\ntravelling-bag on a strap over her shoulder.]\n\n[BORGHEIM comes up from the back on the left. He, too, has a\ntravelling-bag over his shoulder. He is carrying a rolled-up flag.]\n\nBORGHEIM. [Catching sight of ASTA.] Oh, so you are up here!\n\nASTA. Yes, I am taking my last look out over the fiord.\n\nBORGHEIM. Then I am glad I happened to come up.\n\nASTA. Have you been searching for me?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, I have. I wanted to say good-bye to you for the present.\nNot for good and all, I hope.\n\nASTA. [With a faint smile.] You are persevering.\n\nBORGHEIM. A road-maker has got to be.\n\nASTA. Have you seen anything of Alfred? Or of Rita?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, I saw them both.\n\nASTA. Together?\n\nBORGHEIM. No--apart.\n\nASTA. What are you going to do with that flag?\n\nBORGHEIM. Mrs. Allmers asked me to come up and hoist it.\n\nASTA. Hoist a flag just now?\n\nBORGHEIM. Half-mast high. She wants it to fly both night and day, she\nsays.\n\nASTA. [Sighing.] Poor Rita! And poor Alfred!\n\nBORGHEIM. [Busied with the flag.] Have you the heart to leave them? I\nask, because I see you are in travelling-dress.\n\nASTA. [In a low voice.] I must go.\n\nBORGHEIM. Well, if you must, then--\n\nASTA. And you are going, too, to-night?\n\nBORGHEIM. I must, too. I am going by the train. Are you going that way?\n\nASTA. No. I shall take the steamer.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Glancing at her.] We each take our own way, then?\n\nASTA. Yes.\n\n[She sits and looks on while he hoists the flag half-mast high. When he\nhas done he goes up to her.]\n\nBORGHEIM. Miss Asta--you can't think how grieved I am about little\nEyolf.\n\nASTA. [Looks up at him.] Yes, I am sure you feel it deeply.\n\nBORGHEIM. And the feeling tortures me. For the fact is, grief is not\nmuch in my way.\n\nASTA. [Raising her eyes to the flag.] It will pass over in time--all of\nit. All our sorrow.\n\nBORGHEIM. All? Do you believe that?\n\nASTA. Like a squall at sea. When once you have got far away from here,\nthen--\n\nBORGHEIM. It will have to be very far away indeed.\n\nASTA. And then you have this great new road-work, too.\n\nBORGHEIM. But no one to help me in it.\n\nASTA. Oh yes, surely you have.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] No one. No one to share the gladness with.\nFor it is gladness that most needs sharing.\n\nASTA. Not the labour and trouble?\n\nBORGHEIM. Pooh--that sort of thing one can always get through alone.\n\nASTA. But the gladness--that must be shared with someone, you think?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes; for if not, where would be the pleasure in being glad?\n\nASTA. Ah yes--perhaps there is something in that.\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, of course, for a certain time you can go on feeling glad\nin your own heart. But it won't do in the long run. No, it takes two to\nbe glad.\n\nASTA. Always two? Never more? Never many?\n\nBORGHEIM. Well, you see--then it becomes a quite different matter. Miss\nAsta--are you sure you can never make up your mind to share gladness and\nsuccess and--and labour and trouble, with one--with one alone in all the\nworld?\n\nASTA. I have tried it--once.\n\nBORGHEIM. Have you?\n\nASTA. Yes, all the time that my brother--that Alfred and I lived\ntogether.\n\nBORGHEIM. Oh, with your brother, yes. But that is altogether different.\nThat ought rather to be called peace than happiness, I should say.\n\nASTA. It was delightful, all the same.\n\nBORGHEIM. There now--you see even that seemed to you delightful. But\njust think now--if he had not been your brother!\n\nASTA. [Makes a movement to rise, but remains sitting.] Then we should\nnever have been together. For I was a child then--and he wasn't much\nmore.\n\nBORGHEIM. [After a pause.] Was it so delightful--that time?\n\nASTA. Oh yes, indeed it was.\n\nBORGHEIM. Was there much that was really bright and happy in your life\nthen?\n\nASTA. Oh yes, so much. You cannot think how much.\n\nBORGHEIM. Tell me a little about it, Miss Asta.\n\nASTA. Oh, there are only trifles to tell.\n\nBORGHEIM. Such as--? Well?\n\nASTA. Such as the time when Alfred had passed his examination--and had\ndistinguished himself. And then, from time, to time, when he got a post\nin some school or other. Or when he would sit at home working at an\narticle--and would read it aloud to me. And then when it would appear in\nsome magazine.\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes, I can quite see that it must have been a peaceful,\ndelightful life--a brother and sister sharing all their joys. [Shaking\nhis head.] What I cannot understand is that your brother could ever give\nyou up, Asta.\n\nASTA. [With suppressed emotion.] Alfred married, you know.\n\nBORGHEIM. Was not that very hard for you?\n\nASTA. Yes, at first. It seemed as though I had utterly lost him all at\nonce.\n\nBORGHEIM. Well, luckily it was not so bad as that.\n\nASTA. No.\n\nBORGHEIM. But, all the same--how could he! Go and marry, I mean--when he\ncould have kept you with him, alone!\n\nASTA. [Looking straight in front of her.] He was subject to the law of\nchange, I suppose.\n\nBORGHEIM. The law of change?\n\nASTA. So Alfred calls it.\n\nBORGHEIM. Pooh--what a stupid law that must be! I don't believe a bit in\nthat law.\n\nASTA. [Rising.] You may come to believe in it, in time.\n\nBORGHEIM. Never in all my life! [Insistently.] But listen now, Miss\nAsta! Do be reasonable for once in a way--in this matter, I mean--\n\nASTA. [Interrupting him.] Oh, no, no--don't let us begin upon that\nagain!\n\nBORGHEIM. [Continuing as before.] Yes, Asta--I can't possibly give you\nup so easily. Now your brother has everything as he wishes it. He can\nlive his life quite contentedly without you. He doesn't require you at\nall. Then this--this--that at one blow has changed your whole position\nhere--\n\nASTA. [With a start.] What do you mean by that?\n\nBORGHEIM. The loss of the child. What else should I mean?\n\nASTA. [Recovering her self-control.] Little Eyolf is gone, yes.\n\nBORGHEIM. And what more does that leave you to do here? You have not the\npoor little boy to take care of now. You have no duties--no claims upon\nyou of any sort.\n\nASTA. Oh, please, Mr. Borgheim--don't make it so hard for me.\n\nBORGHEIM. I must; I should be mad if I did not try my uttermost. I\nshall be leaving town before very long, and perhaps I shall have no\nopportunity of meeting you there. Perhaps I shall not see you again for\na long, long time. And who knows what may happen in the meanwhile?\n\nASTA. [With a grave smile.] So you are afraid of the law of change,\nafter all?\n\nBORGHEIM. No, not in the least. [Laughing bitterly.] And there is\nnothing to be changed, either--not in you, I mean. For I can see you\ndon't care much about me.\n\nASTA. You know very well that I do.\n\nBORGHEIM. Perhaps, but not nearly enough. Not as I want you to. [More\nforcibly.] By Heaven, Asta--Miss Asta--I cannot tell you how strongly I\nfeel that you are wrong in this! A little onward, perhaps, from to-day\nand to-morrow, all life's happiness may be awaiting us. And we must\nneeds pass it by! Do you think we will not come to repent of it, Asta?\n\nASTA. [Quietly.] I don't know. I only know that they are not for us--all\nthese bright possibilities.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Looks at her with self-control.] Then I must make my roads\nalone?\n\nASTA. [Warmly.] Oh, how I wish I could stand by you in it all! Help you\nin the labour--share the gladness with you--\n\nBORGHEIM. Would you--if you could?\n\nASTA. Yes, that I would.\n\nBORGHEIM. But you cannot?\n\nASTA. [Looking down.] Would you be content to have only half of me?\n\nBORGHEIM. No. You must be utterly and entirely mine.\n\nASTA. [Looks at him, and says quietly.] Then I cannot.\n\nBORGHEIM. Good-bye then, Miss Asta.\n\n[He is on the point of going. ALLMERS comes up from the left at the\nback. BORGHEIM stops.]\n\nALLMERS. [The moment he has reached the top of the steps, points, and\nsays in a low voice.] Is Rita in there--in the summer-house?\n\nBORGHEIM. No; there is no one here but Miss Asta.\n\n[ALLMERS comes forward.]\n\nASTA. [Going towards him.] Shall I go down and look for her? Shall I get\nher to come up here?\n\nALLMERS. [With a negative gesture.] No, no, no--let it alone. [To\nBORGHEIM.] Is it you that have hoisted the flag?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes. Mrs. Allmers asked me to. That was what brought me up\nhere.\n\nALLMERS. And you are going to start to-night?\n\nBORGHEIM. Yes. To-night I go away in good earnest.\n\nALLMERS. [With a glance at ASTA.] And you have made sure of pleasant\ncompany, I daresay.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Shaking his head.] I am going alone.\n\nALLMERS. [With surprise.] Alone!\n\nBORGHEIM. Utterly alone.\n\nALLMERS. [Absently.] Indeed?\n\nBORGHEIM. And I shall have to remain alone, too.\n\nALLMERS. There is something horrible in being alone. The thought of it\nruns like ice through my blood--\n\nASTA. Oh, but, Alfred, you are not alone.\n\nALLMERS. There may be something horrible in that too, Asta.\n\nASTA. [Oppressed.] Oh, don't talk like that! Don't think like that!\n\nALLMERS. [Not listening to her.] But since you are not going with him--?\nSince there is nothing to bind you--? Why will you not remain out here\nwith me--and with Rita?\n\nASTA. [Uneasily.] No, no, I cannot. I must go back to town now.\n\nALLMERS. But only in to town, Asta. Do you hear!\n\nASTA. Yes.\n\nALLMERS. And you must promise me that you will soon come out again.\n\nASTA. [Quickly.] No, no, I dare not promise you that, for the present.\n\nALLMERS. Well as you will. We shall soon meet in town, then.\n\nASTA. [Imploringly.] But, Alfred, you must stay at home here with Rita\nnow.\n\nALLMERS. [Without answering, turns to BORGHEIM.] You may find it a good\nthing, after all, that you have to take your journey alone.\n\nBORGHEIM. [Annoyed.] Oh, how can you say such a thing?\n\nALLMERS. You see, you can never tell whom you might happen to meet\nafterwards--on the way.\n\nASTA. [Involuntarily.] Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. The right fellow-traveller--when it is too late--too late.\n\nASTA. [Softly, quivering.] Alfred! Alfred!\n\nBORGHEIM. [Looking front one to the other.] What is the meaning of this?\nI don't understand--\n\n[RITA comes up from the left at the back.]\n\nRITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, don't go away from me, all of you!\n\nASTA. [Going towards her.] You said you preferred to be alone.\n\nRITA. Yes, but I dare not. It is getting so horribly dark. I seem to see\ngreat, open eyes fixed upon me!\n\nASTA. [Tenderly and sympathetically.] What if it were so, Rita? You\nought not to be afraid of those eyes.\n\nRITA. How can you say so! Not afraid!\n\nALLMERS. [Insistently.] Asta, I beg you--for Heaven's sake--remain here\nwith Rita!\n\nRITA. Yes! And with Alfred, too. Do! Do, Asta!\n\nASTA. [Struggling with herself.] Oh, I want to so much--\n\nRITA. Well, then, do it! For Alfred and I cannot go alone through the\nsorrow and heartache.\n\nALLMERS. [Darkly.] Say, rather--through the ranklings of remorse.\n\nRITA. Oh, whatever you like to call it--we cannot bear it alone, we two.\nOh, Asta, I beg and implore you! Stay here and help us! Take Eyolf's\nplace for us--\n\nASTA. [Shrinking.] Eyolf's--\n\nRITA. Yes, would you not have it so, Alfred?\n\nALLMERS. If she can and will.\n\nRITA. You used to call her your little Eyolf. [Seizes her hand.]\nHenceforth you shall be our Eyolf, Asta! Eyolf, as you were before.\n\nALLMERS. [With concealed emotion.] Remain--and share our life with us,\nAsta. With Rita. With me. With me--your brother!\n\nASTA. [With decision, snatches her hand away.] No. I cannot. [Turning.]\nMr. Borgheim--what time does the steamer start?\n\nBORGHEIM. Now--at once.\n\nASTA. Then I must go on board. Will you go with me?\n\nBORGHEIM. [With a suppressed outburst of joy.] Will I? Yes, yes!\n\nASTA. Then come!\n\nRITA. [Slowly.] Ah! That is how it is. Well, then, you cannot stay with\nus.\n\nASTA. [Throwing her arms round her neck.] Thanks for everything, Rita!\n(Goes up to ALLMERS and grasps his hand.) Alfred-good-bye! A thousand\ntimes, good-bye!\n\nALLMERS. [Softly and eagerly.] What is this, Asta? It seems as though you\nwere taking flight.\n\nASTA. [In subdued anguish.] Yes, Alfred--I am taking flight.\n\nALLMERS. Flight--from me!\n\nASTA. [Whispering.] From you--and from myself.\n\nALLMERS. [Shrinking back.] Ah--!\n\n[ASTA rushes down the steps at the back. BORGHEIM waves his hat and\nfollows her. RITA leans against the entrance to the summer-house.\nALLMERS goes, in strong inward emotion, up to the railing, and stands\nthere gazing downwards. A pause.]\n\nALLMERS. [Turns, and says with hard-won composure.] There comes the\nsteamer. Look, Rita.\n\nRITA. I dare not look at it.\n\nALLMERS. You dare not?\n\nRITA. No. For it has a red eye--and a green one, too. Great, glowing\neyes.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, those are only the lights, you know.\n\nRITA. Henceforth they are eyes--for me. They stare and stare out of the\ndarkness--and into the darkness.\n\nALLMERS. Now she is putting in to shore.\n\nRITA. Where are they mooring her this evening, then?\n\nALLMERS. [Coming forward.] At the pier, as usual--\n\nRITA. [Drawing herself up.] How can they moor her there!\n\nALLMERS. They must.\n\nRITA. But it was there that Eyolf--! How can they moor her there!\n\nALLMERS. Yes, life is pitiless, Rita.\n\nRITA. Men are heartless. They take no thought--whether for the living or\nfor the dead.\n\nALLMERS. There you are right. Life goes its own way--just as if nothing\nin the world had happened.\n\nRITA. [Gazing straight before her.] And nothing has happened, either.\nNot to others. Only to us two.\n\nALLMERS. [The pain re-awakening.] Yes, Rita--so it was to no purpose\nthat you bore him in sorrow and anguish. For now he is gone again--and\nhas left no trace behind him.\n\nRITA. Only the crutch was saved.\n\nALLMERS. [Angrily.] Be silent! Do not let me hear that word!\n\nRITA. [Plaintively.] Oh, I cannot bear the thought that he is gone from\nus.\n\nALLMERS. [Coldly and bitterly.] You could very well do without him while\nhe was with us. Half the day would often pass without your setting eyes\non him.\n\nRITA. Yes, for I knew that I could see him whenever I wanted to.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, that is how we have gone and squandered the short time we\nhad with Little Eyolf.\n\nRITA. [Listening, in dread.] Do you hear, Alfred! Now it is ringing\nagain!\n\nALLMERS. [Looking over the fiord.] It is the steamer's bell that is\nringing. She is just starting.\n\nRITA. Oh, it's not that bell I mean. All day I have heard it ringing in\nmy ears.--Now it is ringing again!\n\nALLMERS. [Going up to her.] You are mistaken, Rita.\n\nRITA. No, I hear it so plainly. It sounds like a knell. Slow. Slow. And\nalways the same words.\n\nALLMERS. Words? What words?\n\nRITA. [Nodding her head in the rhythm.] \"The cr\u00c3\u00batch is--fl\u00c3\u00b3ating. The\ncr\u00c3\u00batch is--fl\u00c3\u00b3ating.\" Oh, surely you must hear it, too!\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I hear nothing. And there is nothing to\nhear.\n\nRITA. Oh, you may say what you will--I hear it so plainly.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking out over the railing.] Now they are on board, Rita.\nNow the steamer is on her way to the town.\n\nRITA. Is it possible you do not hear it? \"The cr\u00c3\u00batch is--fl\u00c3\u00b3ating. The\ncr\u00c3\u00batch is ------\"\n\nALLMERS. [Coming forward.] You shall not stand there listening to a\nsound that does not exist. I tell you, Asta and Borgheim are on board.\nThey have started already. Asta is gone.\n\nRITA. [Looks timidly at him.] Then I suppose you will soon be gone, too,\nAlfred?\n\nALLMERS. [Quickly.] What do you mean by that?\n\nRITA. That you will follow your sister.\n\nALLMERS. Has Asta told you anything?\n\nRITA. No. But you said yourself it was for Asta's sake that--that we\ncame together.\n\nALLMERS. Yes, but you, you yourself, have bound me to you--by our life\ntogether.\n\nRITA. Oh, in your eyes I am not--I am not--entrancingly beautiful any\nmore.\n\nALLMERS. The law of change may perhaps keep us together, none the less.\n\nRITA. [Nodding slowly.] There is a change in me now--I feel the anguish\nof it.\n\nALLMERS. Anguish?\n\nRITA. Yes, for change, too, is a sort of birth.\n\nALLMERS. It is--or a resurrection. Transition to a higher life.\n\nRITA. [Gazing sadly before her.] Yes--with the loss of all, all life's\nhappiness.\n\nALLMERS. That loss is just the gain.\n\nRITA. [Vehemently.] Oh, phrases! Good God, we are creatures of earth\nafter all.\n\nALLMERS. But something akin to the sea and the heavens too, Rita.\n\nRITA. You perhaps. Not I.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, yes--you too, more than you yourself suspect.\n\nRITA. [Advancing a pace towards him.] Tell me, Alfred--could you think\nof taking up your work again?\n\nALLMERS. The work that you have hated so?\n\nRITA. I am easier to please now. I am willing to share you with the\nbook.\n\nALLMERS. Why?\n\nRITA. Only to keep you here with me--to have you near me.\n\nALLMERS. Oh, it is so little I can do to help you, Rita.\n\nRITA. But perhaps I could help you.\n\nALLMERS. With my book, do you mean?\n\nRITA. No; but to live your life.\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] I seem to have no life to live.\n\nRITA. Well then, to endure your life.\n\nALLMERS. [Darkly, looking away from her.] I think it would be best for\nboth of us that we should part.\n\nRITA. [Looking curiously at him.] Then where would you go? Perhaps to\nAsta, after all?\n\nALLMERS. No--never again to Asta.\n\nRITA. Where then?\n\nALLMERS. Up into the solitudes.\n\nRITA. Up among the mountains? Is that what you mean?\n\nALLMERS. Yes.\n\nRITA. But all that is mere dreaming, Alfred! You could not live up\nthere.\n\nALLMERS. And yet I feel myself drawn to them.\n\nRITA. Why? Tell me!\n\nALLMERS. Sit down--and I will tell you something.\n\nRITA. Something that happened to you up there?\n\nALLMERS. Yes.\n\nRITA. And that you never told Asta and me?\n\nALLMERS. Yes.\n\nRITA. Oh, you are so silent about everything. You ought not to be.\n\nALLMERS. Sit down there--and I will tell you about it.\n\nRITA. Yes, yes--tell me!\n\n[She sits on the bench beside the summer-house.]\n\nALLMERS. I was alone up there, in the heart of the great mountains. I\ncame to a wide, dreary mountain lake; and that lake I had to cross. But\nI could not--for there was neither a boat nor anyone there.\n\nRITA. Well? And then?\n\nALLMERS. Then I went without any guidance into a side valley. I thought\nthat by that way I could push on over the heights and between the\npeaks--and then down again on the other side of the lake.\n\nRITA. Oh, and you lost yourself, Alfred!\n\nALLMERS. Yes; I mistook the direction--for there was no path or track.\nAnd all day I went on--and all the next night. And at last I thought I\nshould never see the face of man again.\n\nRITA. Not come home to us? Oh, then, I am sure your thoughts were with\nus here.\n\nALLMERS. No--they were not.\n\nRITA. Not?\n\nALLMERS. No. It was so strange. Both you and Eyolf seemed to have\ndrifted far, far away from me--and Asta, too.\n\nRITA. Then what did you think of?\n\nALLMERS. I did not think. I dragged myself along among the\nprecipices--and revelled in the peace and luxury of death.\n\nRITA. [Springing up.] Oh, don't speak in that way of that horror!\n\nALLMERS. I did not feel it so. I had no fear. Here went death and I,\nit seemed to me, like two good fellow-travellers. It all seemed so\nnatural--so simple, I thought. In my family, we don't live to be old--\n\nRITA. Oh, don't say such things, Alfred! You see you came safely out of\nit, after all.\n\nALLMERS. Yes; all of a sudden, I found myself where I wanted to be--on\nthe other side of the lake.\n\nRITA. It must have been a night of terror for you, Alfred. But now that\nit is over, you will not admit it to yourself.\n\nALLMERS. That night sealed my resolution. And it was then that I turned\nabout and came straight homewards. To Eyolf.\n\nRITA. [Softly.] Too late.\n\nALLMERS. Yes. And then when--my fellow-traveller came and took him--then\nI felt the horror of it; of it all; of all that, in spite of everything,\nwe dare not tear ourselves away from. So earthbound are we, both of us,\nRita.\n\nRITA. [With a gleam of joy.] Yes, you are, too, are you not! [Coming\nclose to him.] Oh, let us live our life together as long as we can!\n\nALLMERS. [Shrugging his shoulders.] Live our life, yes! And have nothing\nto fill life with. An empty void on all sides--wherever I look.\n\nRITA. [In fear.] Oh, sooner or later you will go away from me, Alfred! I\nfeel it! I can see it in your face! You will go away from me.\n\nALLMERS. With my fellow-traveller, do you mean?\n\nRITA. No, I mean worse than that. Of your own free will--you will leave\nme--for you think it's only here, with me, that you have nothing to live\nfor. Is not that what is in your thoughts?\n\nALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] What if it were--?\n\n[A disturbance, and the noise of angry, quarrelling voices is heard from\ndown below, in the distance. ALLMERS goes to the railing.]\n\nRITA. What is that? [With an outburst.] Oh, you'll see, they have found\nhim!\n\nALLMERS. He will never be found.\n\nRITA. But what is it then?\n\nALLMERS. [Coming forward.] Only fighting--as usual.\n\nRITA. Down on the beach?\n\nALLMERS. Yes. The whole village down there ought to be swept away. Now\nthe men have come home--drunk, as they always are. They are beating the\nchildren--do you hear the boys crying! The women are shrieking for help\nfor them--\n\nRITA. Should we not get someone to go down and help them?\n\nALLMERS. [Harshly and angrily.] Help them, who did not help Eyolf! Let\nthem go--as they let Eyolf go.\n\nRITA. Oh, you must not talk like that, Alfred! Nor think like that!\n\nALLMERS. I cannot think otherwise. All the old hovels ought to be torn\ndown.\n\nRITA. And then what is to become of all the poor people?\n\nALLMERS. They must go somewhere else.\n\nRITA. And the children, too?\n\nALLMERS. Does it make much difference where they go to the dogs?\n\nRITA. [Quietly and reproachfully.] You are forcing yourself into this\nharshness, Alfred.\n\nALLMERS. [Vehemently.] I have a right to be harsh now! It is my duty.\n\nRITA. Your duty?\n\nALLMERS. My duty to Eyolf. He must not lie unavenged. Once for all,\nRita--it is as I tell you! Think it over! Have the whole place down\nthere razed to the ground--when I am gone.\n\nRITA. [Looks intently at him.] When you are gone?\n\nALLMERS. Yes. For that will at least give you something to fill your\nlife with--and something you must have.\n\nRITA. [Firmly and decidedly.] There you are right---I must. But can you\nguess what I will set about--when you are gone?\n\nALLMERS. Well, what?\n\nRITA. [Slowly and with resolution.] As soon as you are gone from me,\nI will go down to the beach, and bring all the poor neglected children\nhome with me. All the mischievous boys--\n\nALLMERS. What will you do with them here?\n\nRITA. I will take them to my heart.\n\nALLMERS. You!\n\nRITA. Yes, I will. From the day you leave me, they shall all be here,\nall of them, as if they were mine.\n\nALLMERS. [Shocked.] In our little Eyolf's place!\n\nRITA. Yes, in our little Eyolf's place. They shall live in Eyolf's\nrooms. They shall read his books. They shall play with his toys. They\nshall take it in turns to sit in his chair at table.\n\nALLMERS. But this is sheer madness in you! I do not know a creature in\nthe world that is less fitted than you for anything of that sort.\n\nRITA. Then I shall have to educate myself for it; to train myself; to\ndiscipline myself.\n\nALLMERS. If you are really in earnest about this--about all you\nsay--then there must indeed be a change in you.\n\nRITA. Yes, there is, Alfred--and for that I have you to thank. You\nhave made an empty place within me; and I must try to fill it up with\nsomething--with something that is a little like love.\n\nALLMERS. [Stands for a moment lost in thought; then looks at her.] The\ntruth is, we have not done much for the poor people down there.\n\nRITA. We have done nothing for them.\n\nALLMERS. Scarcely even thought of them.\n\nRITA. Never thought of them in sympathy.\n\nALLMERS. We, who had \"the gold, and the green forests\"--\n\nRITA. Our hands were closed to them. And our hearts too.\n\nALLMERS. [Nods.] Then it was perhaps natural enough, after all, that\nthey should not risk their lives to save little Eyolf.\n\nRITA. [Softly.] Think, Alfred! Are you so certain that--that we would\nhave risked ours?\n\nALLMERS. [With an uneasy gesture of repulsion.] You must never doubt\nthat.\n\nRITA. Oh, we are children of earth.\n\nALLMERS. What do you really think you can do with all these neglected\nchildren?\n\nRITA. I suppose I must try if I cannot lighten and--and ennoble their\nlot in life.\n\nALLMERS. If you can do that--then Eyolf was not born in vain.\n\nRITA. Nor taken from us in vain, either.\n\nALLMERS. [Looking steadfastly at her.] Be quite clear about one thing,\nRita--it is not love that is driving you to this.\n\nRITA. No, it is not--at any rate, not yet.\n\nALLMERS. Well, then what is it?\n\nRITA. [Half-evasively.] You have so often talked to Asta of human\nresponsibility--\n\nALLMERS. Of the book that you hated.\n\nRITA. I hate that book still. But I used to sit and listen to what you\ntold her. And now I will try to continue it--in my own way.\n\nALLMERS. [Shaking his head.] It is not for the sake of that unfinished\nbook--\n\nRITA. No, I have another reason as well.\n\nALLMERS. What is that?\n\nRITA. [Softly, with a melancholy smile.] I want to make my peace with\nthe great, open eyes, you see.\n\nALLMERS. [Struck, fixing his eyes upon her.] Perhaps, I could join you\nin that? And help you, Rita?\n\nRITA. Would you?\n\nALLMERS. Yes--if I were only sure I could.\n\nRITA. [Hesitatingly.] But then you would have to remain here.\n\nALLMERS. [Softly.] Let us try if it could not be so.\n\nRITA. [Almost inaudibly.] Yes, let us, Alfred.\n\n[Both are silent. Then ALLMERS goes up to the flagstaff and hoists the\nflag to the top. RITA stands beside the summer-house and looks at him in\nsilence.]\n\nALLMERS. [Coming forward again.] We have a heavy day of work before us,\nRita.\n\nRITA. You will see--that now and then a Sabbath peace will descend on\nus.\n\nALLMERS.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":152,"split":"train"}
