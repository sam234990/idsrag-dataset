{"ori_id":"e66f82b7832a43751dabfd9dce3180dd28bbd0b3","title":"Three Men in a Boat","context":"Three Men in a Boat\n The story begins by introducing George, Harris, Jerome (always referred to as \"J.\"), and Jerome's dog, a fox terrier called Montmorency. The men are spending an evening in J.'s room, smoking and discussing illnesses from which they fancy they suffer. They conclude that they are all suffering from \"overwork\" and need a holiday. A stay in the country and a sea trip are both considered. The country stay is rejected because Harris claims that it would be dull, the sea-trip after J. describes bad experiences of his brother-in-law and a friend on sea trips. The three eventually decide on a boating holiday up the River Thames, from Kingston upon Thames to Oxford, during which they will camp, notwithstanding more of J.'s anecdotes about previous mishaps with tents and camping stoves.\nThey set off the following Saturday. George must go to work that day, so J. and Harris make their way to Kingston by train. They cannot find the right train at Waterloo Station (the station's confusing layout was a well-known theme of Victorian comedy) so they bribe a train driver to take his train to Kingston, where they collect the hired boat and start the journey. They meet George further up river at Weybridge.\nThe remainder of the story describes their river journey and the incidents that occur. The book's original purpose as a guidebook is apparent as J., the narrator, describes passing landmarks and villages such as Hampton Court Palace, Hampton Church, Magna Carta Island and Monkey Island, and muses on historical associations of these places. However, he frequently digresses into humorous anecdotes that range from the unreliability of barometers for weather forecasting to the difficulties encountered when learning to play the Scottish bagpipes. The most frequent topics of J.'s anecdotes are river pastimes such as fishing and boating and the difficulties they present to the inexperienced and unwary and to the three men on previous boating trips.\nThe book includes classic comedy set pieces, such as the story of two drunken men who slide into the same bed in the dark, the Plaster of Paris trout in chapter 17, and the \"Irish stew\" in chapter 14 \u2013 made by mixing most of the leftovers in the party's food hamper:\nI forget the other ingredients, but I know nothing was wasted; and I remember that, towards the end, Montmorency, who had evinced great interest in the proceedings throughout, strolled away with an earnest and thoughtful air, reappearing, a few minutes afterwards, with a dead water-rat in his mouth, which he evidently wished to present as his contribution to the dinner; whether in a sarcastic spirit, or with a genuine desire to assist, I cannot say.\n\u2014\u2009Chapter 16\nOther memorable sections include chapter 3's description of the author's Uncle Podger creating chaos while hanging a picture, and chapter 4's discussion of \"Advantages of cheese as a travelling companion\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Three Men in a Boat, by Jerome K.

We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how\nbad we were\u00e2\u0080\u0094bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.\n\nWe were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.\nHarris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him at\ntimes, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said that\n_he_ had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what _he_ was doing.\nWith me, it was my liver that was out of order.  I knew it was my liver\nthat was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent\nliver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which\na man could tell when his liver was out of order.  I had them all.\n\nIt is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine\nadvertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am\nsuffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most\nvirulent form.  The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly\nwith all the sensations that I have ever felt.\n\n[Picture: Man reading book] I remember going to the British Museum one\nday to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had a\ntouch\u00e2\u0080\u0094hay fever, I fancy it was.  I got down the book, and read all I\ncame to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the\nleaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally.  I forget\nwhich was the first distemper I plunged into\u00e2\u0080\u0094some fearful, devastating\nscourge, I know\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, before I had glanced half down the list of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpremonitory symptoms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got it.\n\nI sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of\ndespair, I again turned over the pages.  I came to typhoid fever\u00e2\u0080\u0094read the\nsymptoms\u00e2\u0080\u0094discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it for months\nwithout knowing it\u00e2\u0080\u0094wondered what else I had got; turned up St. Vitus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nDance\u00e2\u0080\u0094found, as I expected, that I had that too,\u00e2\u0080\u0094began to get interested\nin my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom, and so started\nalphabetically\u00e2\u0080\u0094read up ague, and learnt that I was sickening for it, and\nthat the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.  Bright\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisease, I was relieved to find, I had only in a modified form, and, so\nfar as that was concerned, I might live for years.  Cholera I had, with\nsevere complications; and diphtheria I seemed to have been born with.  I\nplodded conscientiously through the twenty-six letters, and the only\nmalady I could conclude I had not got was housemaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee.\n\nI felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of\nslight.  Why hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I got housemaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee?  Why this invidious\nreservation?  After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.\nI reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology, and\nI grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee.\nGout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without\nmy being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been suffering with\nfrom boyhood.  There were no more diseases after zymosis, so I concluded\nthere was nothing else the matter with me.\n\nI sat and pondered.  I thought what an interesting case I must be from a\nmedical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!\nStudents would have no need to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwalk the hospitals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they had me.  I\nwas a hospital in myself.  All they need do would be to walk round me,\nand, after that, take their diploma.\n\nThen I wondered how long I had to live.  I tried to examine myself.  I\nfelt my pulse.  I could not at first feel any pulse at all.  Then, all of\na sudden, it seemed to start off.  I pulled out my watch and timed it.  I\nmade it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute.  I tried to feel my\nheart.  I could not feel my heart.  It had stopped beating.  I have since\nbeen induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the\ntime, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.  I patted\nmyself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I\nwent a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.  But I could\nnot feel or hear anything.  I tried to look at my tongue.  I stuck it out\nas far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it\nwith the other.  I could only see the tip, and the only thing that I\ncould gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had\nscarlet fever.\n\n[Picture: Man with walking stick] I had walked into that reading-room a\nhappy, healthy man.  I crawled out a decrepit wreck.\n\nI went to my medical man.  He is an old chum of mine, and feels my pulse,\nand looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for nothing,\nwhen I fancy I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to\nhim now.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a doctor wants,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis practice.  He shall have me.\nHe will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your\nordinary, commonplace patients, with only one or two diseases each.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  So\nI went straight up and saw him, and he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the\nmatter with me.  Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had\nfinished.  But I will tell you what is _not_ the matter with me.  I have\nnot got housemaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee.  Why I have not got housemaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee, I cannot\ntell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it.  Everything else,\nhowever, I _have_ got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd I told him how I came to discover it all.\n\nThen he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist, and\nthen he hit me over the chest when I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expecting it\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cowardly thing\nto do, I call it\u00e2\u0080\u0094and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of\nhis head.  After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription, and\nfolded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.\n\nI did not open it.  I took it to the nearest chemist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and handed it in.\nThe man read it, and then handed it back.\n\nHe said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep it.\n\nI said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a chemist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a chemist.  If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel\ncombined, I might be able to oblige you.  Being only a chemist hampers\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI read the prescription.  It ran:\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009c1 lb. beefsteak, with\n    1 pt. bitter beer\n\n                                                            every 6 hours.\n\n    1 ten-mile walk every morning.\n\n    1 bed at 11 sharp every night.\n\n    And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stuff up your head with things you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nI followed the directions, with the happy result\u00e2\u0080\u0094speaking for myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\nmy life was preserved, and is still going on.\n\nIn the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had the\nsymptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being \u00e2\u0080\u009ca general\ndisinclination to work of any kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat I suffer in that way no tongue can tell.  From my earliest infancy I\nhave been a martyr to it.  As a boy, the disease hardly ever left me for\na day.  They did not know, then, that it was my liver.  Medical science\nwas in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put it down\nto laziness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you skulking little devil, you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cget up and do\nsomething for your living, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094not knowing, of course, that I was\nill.\n\nAnd they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the\nhead.  And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often\ncured me\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the time being.  I have known one clump on the head have\nmore effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight\naway then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further\nloss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.\n\nYou know, it often is so\u00e2\u0080\u0094those simple, old-fashioned remedies are\nsometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.\n\nWe sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies.  I\nexplained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the\nmorning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed; and\nGeorge stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful piece\nof acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.\n\nGeorge _fancies_ he is ill; but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never anything really the matter\nwith him, you know.\n\nAt this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were ready\nfor supper.  We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed we had\nbetter try to swallow a bit.  Harris said a little something in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought the\ntray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak and\nonions, and some rhubarb tart.\n\nI must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first\nhalf-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food\u00e2\u0080\u0094an\nunusual thing for me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any cheese.\n\nThis duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed the\ndiscussion upon our state of health.  What it was that was actually the\nmatter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous opinion\nwas that it\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever it was\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been brought on by overwork.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we want is rest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRest and a complete change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe overstrain upon our\nbrains has produced a general depression throughout the system.  Change\nof scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the\nmental equilibrium.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet as a\nmedical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat family-physicianary\nway of putting things.\n\nI agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out some retired\nand old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, and dream away a sunny\nweek among its drowsy lanes\u00e2\u0080\u0094some half-forgotten nook, hidden away by the\nfairies, out of reach of the noisy world\u00e2\u0080\u0094some quaint-perched eyrie on the\ncliffs of Time, from whence the surging waves of the nineteenth century\nwould sound far-off and faint.\n\nHarris said he thought it would be humpy.  He said he knew the sort of\nplace I meant; where everybody went to bed at eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and you\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a _Referee_ for love or money, and had to walk ten miles to\nget your baccy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you want rest and change, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t beat a sea\ntrip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI objected to the sea trip strongly.  A sea trip does you good when you\nare going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is\nwicked.\n\nYou start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you are\ngoing to enjoy yourself.  You wave an airy adieu to the boys on shore,\nlight your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were\nCaptain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all rolled into\none.  On Tuesday, you wish you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come.  On Wednesday, Thursday, and\nFriday, you wish you were dead.  On Saturday, you are able to swallow a\nlittle beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet\nsmile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now.  On Sunday, you\nbegin to walk about again, and take solid food.  And on Monday morning,\nas, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale,\nwaiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.\n\nI remember my brother-in-law going for a short sea trip once, for the\nbenefit of his health.  He took a return berth from London to Liverpool;\nand when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to\nsell that return ticket.\n\nIt was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so I am told;\nand was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious-looking youth who\nhad just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea-side, and take\nexercise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSea-side!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my brother-in-law, pressing the ticket affectionately\ninto his hand; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as\nfor exercise! why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship,\nthan you would turning somersaults on dry land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094my brother-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0094came back by train.  He said the\nNorth-Western Railway was healthy enough for him.\n\nAnother fellow I knew went for a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voyage round the coast, and,\nbefore they started, the steward came to him to ask whether he would pay\nfor each meal as he had it, or arrange beforehand for the whole series.\n\nThe steward recommended the latter course, as it would come so much\ncheaper.  He said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds\nfive.  He said for breakfast there would be fish, followed by a grill.\nLunch was at one, and consisted of four courses.  Dinner at six\u00e2\u0080\u0094soup,\nfish, entree, joint, poultry, salad, sweets, cheese, and dessert.  And a\nlight meat supper at ten.\n\nMy friend thought he would close on the two-pound-five job (he is a\nhearty eater), and did so.\n\nLunch came just as they were off Sheerness.  He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel so hungry as\nhe thought he should, and so contented himself with a bit of boiled beef,\nand some strawberries and cream.  He pondered a good deal during the\nafternoon, and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating\nnothing but boiled beef for weeks, and at other times it seemed that he\nmust have been living on strawberries and cream for years.\n\nNeither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy,\neither\u00e2\u0080\u0094seemed discontented like.\n\nAt six, they came and told him dinner was ready.  The announcement\naroused no enthusiasm within him, but he felt that there was some of that\ntwo-pound-five to be worked off, and he held on to ropes and things and\nwent down.  A pleasant odour of onions and hot ham, mingled with fried\nfish and greens, greeted him at the bottom of the ladder; and then the\nsteward came up with an oily smile, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I get you, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: Man feeling ill] \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet me out of this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the feeble reply.\n\nAnd they ran him up quick, and propped him up, over to leeward, and left\nhim.\n\nFor the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin\ncaptain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biscuits (I mean that the biscuits were thin, not the captain)\nand soda-water; but, towards Saturday, he got uppish, and went in for\nweak tea and dry toast, and on Monday he was gorging himself on chicken\nbroth.  He left the ship on Tuesday, and as it steamed away from the\nlanding-stage he gazed after it regretfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere she goes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere she goes, with two pounds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth of\nfood on board that belongs to me, and that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have\nput it straight.\n\nSo I set my face against the sea trip.  Not, as I explained, upon my own\naccount.  I was never queer.  But I was afraid for George.  George said\nhe should be all right, and would rather like it, but he would advise\nHarris and me not to think of it, as he felt sure we should both be ill.\nHarris said that, to himself, it was always a mystery how people managed\nto get sick at sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094said he thought people must do it on purpose, from\naffectation\u00e2\u0080\u0094said he had often wished to be, but had never been able.\n\nThen he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the Channel when it\nwas so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths, and he\nand the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not ill.\nSometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill; but it was\ngenerally he and one other man.  If not he and another man, then it was\nhe by himself.\n\nIt is a curious fact, but nobody ever is sea-sick\u00e2\u0080\u0094on land.  At sea, you\ncome across plenty of people very bad indeed, whole boat-loads of them;\nbut I never met a man yet, on land, who had ever known at all what it was\nto be sea-sick.  Where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors that\nswarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a mystery.\n\nIf most men were like a fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat one day, I\ncould account for the seeming enigma easily enough.  It was just off\nSouthend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out through one of the\nport-holes in a very dangerous position.  I went up to him to try and\nsave him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHi! come further in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, shaking him by the shoulder.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\noverboard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my! I wish I was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the only answer I could get; and there I had\nto leave him.\n\nThree weeks afterwards, I met him in the coffee-room of a Bath hotel,\ntalking about his voyages, and explaining, with enthusiasm, how he loved\nthe sea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood sailor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied in answer to a mild young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s envious query;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, I did feel a little queer _once_, I confess.  It was off Cape\nHorn.  The vessel was wrecked the next morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWeren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be\nthrown overboard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSouthend Pier!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, with a puzzled expression.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, ah\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, brightening up; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember now.  I did have a\nheadache that afternoon.  It was the pickles, you know.  They were the\nmost disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat.  Did _you_\nhave any?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against\nsea-sickness, in balancing myself.  You stand in the centre of the deck,\nand, as the ship heaves and pitches, you move your body about, so as to\nkeep it always straight.  When the front of the ship rises, you lean\nforward, till the deck almost touches your nose; and when its back end\ngets up, you lean backwards.  This is all very well for an hour or two;\nbut you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t balance yourself for a week.\n\nGeorge said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go up the river.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said we should have fresh air, exercise and quiet; the constant change\nof scene would occupy our minds (including what there was of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s);\nand the hard work would give us a good appetite, and make us sleep well.\n\nHarris said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think George ought to do anything that would have a\ntendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might be\ndangerous.  He said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well understand how George was going\nto sleep any more than he did now, seeing that there were only\ntwenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; but thought that\nif he _did_ sleep any more, he might just as well be dead, and so save\nhis board and lodging.\n\nHarris said, however, that the river would suit him to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cT.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow what a \u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u009d is (except a sixpenny one, which includes\nbread-and-butter and cake _ad lib._, and is cheap at the price, if you\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had any dinner).  It seems to suit everybody, however, which is\ngreatly to its credit.\n\nIt suited me to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u009d too, and Harris and I both said it was a good idea\nof George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that\nwe were surprised that George should have come out so sensible.\n\n[Picture: Montmorency] The only one who was not struck with the\nsuggestion was Montmorency.  He never did care for the river, did\nMontmorency.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all very well for you fellows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou like it, but _I_\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing for me to do.  Scenery is not in my line, and I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t smoke.  If I see a rat, you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop; and if I go to sleep, you\nget fooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard.  If you ask me, I\ncall the whole thing bally foolishness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nPlans discussed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pleasures of \u00e2\u0080\u009ccamping-out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on fine nights.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ditto, wet\nnights.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Compromise decided on.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Montmorency, first impressions of.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fears\nlest he is too good for this world, fears subsequently dismissed as\ngroundless.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Meeting adjourns.\n\nWe pulled out the maps, and discussed plans.\n\nWe arranged to start on the following Saturday from Kingston.  Harris and\nI would go down in the morning, and take the boat up to Chertsey, and\nGeorge, who would not be able to get away from the City till the\nafternoon (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day,\nexcept Saturdays, when they wake him up and put him outside at two),\nwould meet us there.\n\nShould we \u00e2\u0080\u009ccamp out\u00e2\u0080\u009d or sleep at inns?\n\nGeorge and I were for camping out.  We said it would be so wild and free,\nso patriarchal like.\n\nSlowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the\ncold, sad clouds.  Silent, like sorrowing children, the birds have ceased\ntheir song, and only the moorhen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plaintive cry and the harsh croak of\nthe corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters, where the\ndying day breathes out her last.\n\nFrom the dim woods on either bank, Night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ghostly army, the grey\nshadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering\nrear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above the\nwaving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes; and Night, upon her\nsombre throne, folds her black wings above the darkening world, and, from\nher phantom palace, lit by the pale stars, reigns in stillness.\n\n                          [Picture: River scene]\n\nThen we run our little boat into some quiet nook, and the tent is\npitched, and the frugal supper cooked and eaten.  Then the big pipes are\nfilled and lighted, and the pleasant chat goes round in musical\nundertone; while, in the pauses of our talk, the river, playing round the\nboat, prattles strange old tales and secrets, sings low the old child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsong that it has sung so many thousand years\u00e2\u0080\u0094will sing so many thousand\nyears to come, before its voice grows harsh and old\u00e2\u0080\u0094a song that we, who\nhave learnt to love its changing face, who have so often nestled on its\nyielding bosom, think, somehow, we understand, though we could not tell\nyou in mere words the story that we listen to.\n\nAnd we sit there, by its margin, while the moon, who loves it too, stoops\ndown to kiss it with a sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kiss, and throws her silver arms around\nit clingingly; and we watch it as it flows, ever singing, ever\nwhispering, out to meet its king, the sea\u00e2\u0080\u0094till our voices die away in\nsilence, and the pipes go out\u00e2\u0080\u0094till we, common-place, everyday young men\nenough, feel strangely full of thoughts, half sad, half sweet, and do not\ncare or want to speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094till we laugh, and, rising, knock the ashes from\nour burnt-out pipes, and say \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, lulled by the lapping\nwater and the rustling trees, we fall asleep beneath the great, still\nstars, and dream that the world is young again\u00e2\u0080\u0094young and sweet as she\nused to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her fair face,\nere her children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sins and follies had made old her loving heart\u00e2\u0080\u0094sweet\nas she was in those bygone days when, a new-made mother, she nursed us,\nher children, upon her own deep breast\u00e2\u0080\u0094ere the wiles of painted\ncivilization had lured us away from her fond arms, and the poisoned\nsneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life we led\nwith her, and the simple, stately home where mankind was born so many\nthousands years ago.\n\nHarris said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about when it rained?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou can never rouse Harris.  There is no poetry about Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0094no wild\nyearning for the unattainable.  Harris never \u00e2\u0080\u009cweeps, he knows not why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIf Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes fill with tears, you can bet it is because Harris has\nbeen eating raw onions, or has put too much Worcester over his chop.\n\n[Picture: Mermaid] If you were to stand at night by the sea-shore with\nHarris, and say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHark! do you not hear?  Is it but the mermaids singing deep below the\nwaving waters; or sad spirits, chanting dirges for white corpses, held by\nseaweed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Harris would take you by the arm, and say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what it is, old man; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a chill.  Now, you come along\nwith me.  I know a place round the corner here, where you can get a drop\nof the finest Scotch whisky you ever tasted\u00e2\u0080\u0094put you right in less than no\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris always does know a place round the corner where you can get\nsomething brilliant in the drinking line.  I believe that if you met\nHarris up in Paradise (supposing such a thing likely), he would\nimmediately greet you with:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo glad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come, old fellow; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found a nice place round the\ncorner here, where you can get some really first-class nectar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the present instance, however, as regarded the camping out, his\npractical view of the matter came as a very timely hint.  Camping out in\nrainy weather is not pleasant.\n\nIt is evening.  You are wet through, and there is a good two inches of\nwater in the boat, and all the things are damp.  You find a place on the\nbanks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen, and you\nland and lug out the tent, and two of you proceed to fix it.\n\nIt is soaked and heavy, and it flops about, and tumbles down on you, and\nclings round your head and makes you mad.  The rain is pouring steadily\ndown all the time.  It is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry weather:\nin wet, the task becomes herculean.  Instead of helping you, it seems to\nyou that the other man is simply playing the fool.  Just as you get your\nside beautifully fixed, he gives it a hoist from his end, and spoils it\nall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere! what are you up to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d you call out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are _you_ up to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorts; \u00e2\u0080\u009cleggo, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull it; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it all wrong, you stupid ass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you shout.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he yells back; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet go your side!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it all wrong!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you roar, wishing that you could\nget at him; and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, the bally idiot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you hear him mutter to himself; and then comes a\nsavage haul, and away goes your side.  You lay down the mallet and start\nto go round and tell him what you think about the whole business, and, at\nthe same time, he starts round in the same direction to come and explain\nhis views to you.  And you follow each other round and round, swearing at\none another, until the tent tumbles down in a heap, and leaves you\nlooking at each other across its ruins, when you both indignantly\nexclaim, in the same breath:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are! what did I tell you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile the third man, who has been baling out the boat, and who has\nspilled the water down his sleeve, and has been cursing away to himself\nsteadily for the last ten minutes, wants to know what the thundering\nblazes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re playing at, and why the blarmed tent isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t up yet.\n\nAt last, somehow or other, it does get up, and you land the things.  It\nis hopeless attempting to make a wood fire, so you light the methylated\nspirit stove, and crowd round that.\n\nRainwater is the chief article of diet at supper.  The bread is\ntwo-thirds rainwater, the beefsteak-pie is exceedingly rich in it, and\nthe jam, and the butter, and the salt, and the coffee have all combined\nwith it to make soup.\n\nAfter supper, you find your tobacco is damp, and you cannot smoke.\nLuckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates, if\ntaken in proper quantity, and this restores to you sufficient interest in\nlife to induce you to go to bed.\n\nThere you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest, and\nthat the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom of the\nsea\u00e2\u0080\u0094the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom.  You wake up\nand grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened.  Your\nfirst impression is that the end of the world has come; and then you\nthink that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers, or else\nfire, and this opinion you express in the usual method.  No help comes,\nhowever, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you,\nand you are being smothered.\n\nSomebody else seems in trouble, too.  You can hear his faint cries coming\nfrom underneath your bed.  Determining, at all events, to sell your life\ndearly, you struggle frantically, hitting out right and left with arms\nand legs, and yelling lustily the while, and at last something gives way,\nand you find your head in the fresh air.  Two feet off, you dimly observe\na half-dressed ruffian, waiting to kill you, and you are preparing for a\nlife-and-death struggle with him, when it begins to dawn upon you that\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, recognising you at the same moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you answer, rubbing your eyes; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBally tent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blown down, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bill?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen you both raise up your voices and shout for \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the ground\nbeneath you heaves and rocks, and the muffled voice that you heard before\nreplies from out the ruin:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet off my head, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Bill struggles out, a muddy, trampled wreck, and in an unnecessarily\naggressive mood\u00e2\u0080\u0094he being under the evident belief that the whole thing\nhas been done on purpose.\n\nIn the morning you are all three speechless, owing to having caught\nsevere colds in the night; you also feel very quarrelsome, and you swear\nat each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast time.\n\nWe therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights; and hotel\nit, and inn it, and pub. it, like respectable folks, when it was wet, or\nwhen we felt inclined for a change.\n\nMontmorency hailed this compromise with much approval.  He does not revel\nin romantic solitude.  Give him something noisy; and if a trifle low, so\nmuch the jollier.  To look at Montmorency you would imagine that he was\nan angel sent upon the earth, for some reason withheld from mankind, in\nthe shape of a small fox-terrier.  There is a sort of\nOh-what-a-wicked-world-this-is-and-how-I-wish-I-could-do-something-to-\nmake-it-better-and-nobler expression about Montmorency that has been\nknown to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and gentlemen.\n\nWhen first he came to live at my expense, I never thought I should be\nable to get him to stop long.  I used to sit down and look at him, as he\nsat on the rug and looked up at me, and think: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that dog will never\nlive.  He will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot, that is\nwhat will happen to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut, when I had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed; and\nhad dragged him, growling and kicking, by the scruff of his neck, out of\na hundred and fourteen street fights; and had had a dead cat brought\nround for my inspection by an irate female, who called me a murderer; and\nhad been summoned by the man next door but one for having a ferocious dog\nat large, that had kept him pinned up in his own tool-shed, afraid to\nventure his nose outside the door for over two hours on a cold night; and\nhad learned that the gardener, unknown to myself, had won thirty\nshillings by backing him to kill rats against time, then I began to think\nthat maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let him remain on earth for a bit longer, after all.\n\nTo hang about a stable, and collect a gang of the most disreputable dogs\nto be found in the town, and lead them out to march round the slums to\nfight other disreputable dogs, is Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009clife;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and so,\nas I before observed, he gave to the suggestion of inns, and pubs., and\nhotels his most emphatic approbation.\n\nHaving thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of all\nfour of us, the only thing left to discuss was what we should take with\nus; and this we had begun to argue, when Harris said he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had enough\noratory for one night, and proposed that we should go out and have a\nsmile, saying that he had found a place, round by the square, where you\ncould really get a drop of Irish worth drinking.\n\n[Picture: Whisky glass] George said he felt thirsty (I never knew George\nwhen he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t); and, as I had a presentiment that a little whisky, warm,\nwith a slice of lemon, would do my complaint good, the debate was, by\ncommon assent, adjourned to the following night; and the assembly put on\nits hats and went out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nArrangements settled.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method of doing work.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How the elderly,\nfamily-man puts up a picture.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George makes a sensible, remark.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Delights\nof early morning bathing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Provisions for getting upset.\n\nSo, on the following evening, we again assembled, to discuss and arrange\nour plans.  Harris said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, the first thing to settle is what to take with us.  Now, you get a\nbit of paper and write down, J., and you get the grocery catalogue,\nGeorge, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make out a\nlist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harris all over\u00e2\u0080\u0094so ready to take the burden of everything himself,\nand put it on the backs of other people.\n\nHe always reminds me of my poor Uncle Podger.  You never saw such a\ncommotion up and down a house, in all your life, as when my Uncle Podger\nundertook to do a job.  A picture would have come home from the\nframe-maker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and be standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put up;\nand Aunt Podger would ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle Podger\nwould say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you leave that to _me_.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, any of you, worry yourselves\nabout that.  _I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll_ do all that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he would take off his coat, and begin.  He would send the girl\nout for sixpen\u00e2\u0080\u0099orth of nails, and then one of the boys after her to tell\nher what size to get; and, from that, he would gradually work down, and\nstart the whole house.\n\n[Picture: Candle] \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you go and get me my hammer, Will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would\nshout; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the step-ladder,\nand I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you run round to\nMr. Goggles, and tell him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind regards, and hopes his leg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbetter; and will he lend him his spirit-level?\u00e2\u0080\u0099  And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go, Maria,\nbecause I shall want somebody to hold me the light; and when the girl\ncomes back, she must go out again for a bit of picture-cord; and\nTom!\u00e2\u0080\u0094where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tom?\u00e2\u0080\u0094Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me up the\npicture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he would lift up the picture, and drop it, and it would come out\nof the frame, and he would try to save the glass, and cut himself; and\nthen he would spring round the room, looking for his handkerchief.  He\ncould not find his handkerchief, because it was in the pocket of the coat\nhe had taken off, and he did not know where he had put the coat, and all\nthe house had to leave off looking for his tools, and start looking for\nhis coat; while he would dance round and hinder them.\n\n[Picture: Nails etc.] \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anybody in the whole house know where my\ncoat is?  I never came across such a set in all my life\u00e2\u0080\u0094upon my word I\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  Six of you!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a coat that I put down not five\nminutes ago!  Well, of all the\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get up, and find that he had been sitting on it, and would call\nout:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can give it up!  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found it myself now.  Might just as well\nask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger, and a new\nglass had been got, and the tools, and the ladder, and the chair, and the\ncandle had been brought, he would have another go, the whole family,\nincluding the girl and the charwoman, standing round in a semi-circle,\nready to help.  Two people would have to hold the chair, and a third\nwould help him up on it, and hold him there, and a fourth would hand him\na nail, and a fifth would pass him up the hammer, and he would take hold\nof the nail, and drop it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, in an injured tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow the nail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it, while he\nwould stand on the chair, and grunt, and want to know if he was to be\nkept there all the evening.\n\nThe nail would be found at last, but by that time he would have lost the\nhammer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hammer?  What did I do with the hammer?  Great heavens!\nSeven of you, gaping round there, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I did with the\nhammer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe would find the hammer for him, and then he would have lost sight of\nthe mark he had made on the wall, where the nail was to go in, and each\nof us had to get up on the chair, beside him, and see if we could find\nit; and we would each discover it in a different place, and he would call\nus all fools, one after another, and tell us to get down.  And he would\ntake the rule, and re-measure, and find that he wanted half thirty-one\nand three-eighths inches from the corner, and would try to do it in his\nhead, and go mad.\n\nAnd we would all try to do it in our heads, and all arrive at different\nresults, and sneer at one another.  And in the general row, the original\nnumber would be forgotten, and Uncle Podger would have to measure it\nagain.\n\nHe would use a bit of string this time, and at the critical moment, when\nthe old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty-five, and\ntrying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for him to\nreach, the string would slip, and down he would slide on to the piano, a\nreally fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness with which\nhis head and body struck all the notes at the same time.\n\nAnd Aunt Maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand\nround and hear such language.\n\nAt last, Uncle Podger would get the spot fixed again, and put the point\nof the nail on it with his left hand, and take the hammer in his right\nhand.  And, with the first blow, he would smash his thumb, and drop the\nhammer, with a yell, on somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toes.\n\nAunt Maria would mildly observe that, next time Uncle Podger was going to\nhammer a nail into the wall, she hoped he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let her know in time, so that\nshe could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother while\nit was being done.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! you women, you make such a fuss over everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Uncle Podger would\nreply, picking himself up.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I _like_ doing a little job of this\nsort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                [Picture: Uncle Podger admiring his work]\n\nAnd then he would have another try, and, at the second blow, the nail\nwould go clean through the plaster, and half the hammer after it, and\nUncle Podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly\nsufficient to flatten his nose.\n\nThen we had to find the rule and the string again, and a new hole was\nmade; and, about midnight, the picture would be up\u00e2\u0080\u0094very crooked and\ninsecure, the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed\ndown with a rake, and everybody dead beat and wretched\u00e2\u0080\u0094except Uncle\nPodger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, stepping heavily off the chair on to the\ncharwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corns, and surveying the mess he had made with evident pride.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, some people would have had a man in to do a little thing like\nthat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris will be just that sort of man when he grows up, I know, and I told\nhim so.  I said I could not permit him to take so much labour upon\nhimself.  I said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; _you_ get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, and George\nwrite down, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do the work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe first list we made out had to be discarded.  It was clear that the\nupper reaches of the Thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat\nsufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable;\nso we tore the list up, and looked at one another!\n\nGeorge said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know we are on a wrong track altogether.  We must not think of the\nthings we could do with, but only of the things that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nwithout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge comes out really quite sensible at times.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be surprised.  I\ncall that downright wisdom, not merely as regards the present case, but\nwith reference to our trip up the river of life, generally.  How many\npeople, on that voyage, load up the boat till it is ever in danger of\nswamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to the\npleasure and comfort of the trip, but which are really only useless\nlumber.\n\nHow they pile the poor little craft mast-high with fine clothes and big\nhouses; with useless servants, and a host of swell friends that do not\ncare twopence for them, and that they do not care three ha\u00e2\u0080\u0099pence for;\nwith expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and\nfashions, with pretence and ostentation, and with\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, heaviest, maddest\nlumber of all!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dread of what will my neighbour think, with luxuries\nthat only cloy, with pleasures that bore, with empty show that, like the\ncriminal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iron crown of yore, makes to bleed and swoon the aching head\nthat wears it!\n\nIt is lumber, man\u00e2\u0080\u0094all lumber!  Throw it overboard.  It makes the boat so\nheavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars.  It makes it so cumbersome\nand dangerous to manage, you never know a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freedom from anxiety\nand care, never gain a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest for dreamy laziness\u00e2\u0080\u0094no time to watch\nthe windy shadows skimming lightly o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er the shallows, or the glittering\nsunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the great trees by the\nmargin looking down at their own image, or the woods all green and\ngolden, or the lilies white and yellow, or the sombre-waving rushes, or\nthe sedges, or the orchis, or the blue forget-me-nots.\n\nThrow the lumber over, man!  Let your boat of life be light, packed with\nonly what you need\u00e2\u0080\u0094a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two\nfriends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a cat,\na dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a little\nmore than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.\n\nYou will find the boat easier to pull then, and it will not be so liable\nto upset, and it will not matter so much if it does upset; good, plain\nmerchandise will stand water.  You will have time to think as well as to\nwork.  Time to drink in life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sunshine\u00e2\u0080\u0094time to listen to the \u00c3\u0086olian\nmusic that the wind of God draws from the human heart-strings around\nus\u00e2\u0080\u0094time to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nI beg your pardon, really.  I quite forgot.\n\nWell, we left the list to George, and he began it.\n\n[Picture: Tent] \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a tent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will have a\nboat with a cover.  It is ever so much simpler, and more comfortable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed a good thought, and we adopted it.  I do not know whether you\nhave ever seen the thing I mean.  You fix iron hoops up over the boat,\nand stretch a huge canvas over them, and fasten it down all round, from\nstem to stern, and it converts the boat into a sort of little house, and\nit is beautifully cosy, though a trifle stuffy; but there, everything has\nits drawbacks, as the man said when his mother-in-law died, and they came\ndown upon him for the funeral expenses.\n\nGeorge said that in that case we must take a rug each, a lamp, some soap,\na brush and comb (between us), a toothbrush (each), a basin, some\ntooth-powder, some shaving tackle (sounds like a French exercise, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit?), and a couple of big-towels for bathing.  I notice that people\nalways make gigantic arrangements for bathing when they are going\nanywhere near the water, but that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bathe much when they are\nthere.\n\n[Picture: Sea-side scene] It is the same when you go to the sea-side.  I\nalways determine\u00e2\u0080\u0094when thinking over the matter in London\u00e2\u0080\u0094that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get up\nearly every morning, and go and have a dip before breakfast, and I\nreligiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel.  I always get red\nbathing drawers.  I rather fancy myself in red drawers.  They suit my\ncomplexion so.  But when I get to the sea I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel somehow that I\nwant that early morning bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in town.\n\nOn the contrary, I feel more that I want to stop in bed till the last\nmoment, and then come down and have my breakfast.  Once or twice virtue\nhas triumphed, and I have got out at six and half-dressed myself, and\nhave taken my drawers and towel, and stumbled dismally off.  But I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoyed it.  They seem to keep a specially cutting east wind,\nwaiting for me, when I go to bathe in the early morning; and they pick\nout all the three-cornered stones, and put them on the top, and they\nsharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so that\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out, so that\nI have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shivering, through six\ninches of water.  And when I do get to the sea, it is rough and quite\ninsulting.\n\nOne huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture, as hard\nas ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me.  And,\nbefore I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Ugh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and found out what has gone, the wave comes\nback and carries me out to mid-ocean.  I begin to strike out frantically\nfor the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and\nwish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I\nmean).  Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and leaves me\nsprawling like a star-fish on the sand, and I get up and look back and\nfind that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water.  I hop\nback and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked it.\n\nIn the present instance, we all talked as if we were going to have a long\nswim every morning.\n\nGeorge said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh\nmorning, and plunge into the limpid river.  Harris said there was nothing\nlike a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite.  He said it always\ngave him an appetite.  George said that if it was going to make Harris\neat more than Harris ordinarily ate, then he should protest against\nHarris having a bath at all.\n\nHe said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food\nfor Harris up against stream, as it was.\n\nI urged upon George, however, how much pleasanter it would be to have\nHarris clean and fresh about the boat, even if we did have to take a few\nmore hundredweight of provisions; and he got to see it in my light, and\nwithdrew his opposition to Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bath.\n\nAgreed, finally, that we should take _three_ bath towels, so as not to\nkeep each other waiting.\n\nFor clothes, George said two suits of flannel would be sufficient, as we\ncould wash them ourselves, in the river, when they got dirty.  We asked\nhim if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river, and he replied:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not exactly himself like; but he knew some fellows who had, and it\nwas easy enough;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Harris and I were weak enough to fancy he knew what\nhe was talking about, and that three respectable young men, without\nposition or influence, and with no experience in washing, could really\nclean their own shirts and trousers in the river Thames with a bit of\nsoap.\n\nWe were to learn in the days to come, when it was too late, that George\nwas a miserable impostor, who could evidently have known nothing whatever\nabout the matter.  If you had seen these clothes after\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, as the\nshilling shockers say, we anticipate.\n\nGeorge impressed upon us to take a change of under-things and plenty of\nsocks, in case we got upset and wanted a change; also plenty of\nhandkerchiefs, as they would do to wipe things, and a pair of leather\nboots as well as our boating shoes, as we should want them if we got\nupset.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe food question.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Objections to paraffine oil as an\natmosphere.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Advantages of cheese as a travelling companion.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A married\nwoman deserts her home.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Further provision for getting upset.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\npack.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cussedness of tooth-brushes.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and Harris pack.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Awful\nbehaviour of Montmorency.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We retire to rest.\n\nThen we discussed the food question.  George said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBegin with breakfast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  (George is so practical.)  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow for breakfast we\nshall want a frying-pan\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094(Harris said it was indigestible; but we merely\nurged him not to be an ass, and George went on)\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca tea-pot and a kettle,\nand a methylated spirit stove.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo oil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, with a significant look; and Harris and I agreed.\n\nWe had taken up an oil-stove once, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cnever again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It had been like\nliving in an oil-shop that week.  It oozed.  I never saw such a thing as\nparaffine oil is to ooze.  We kept it in the nose of the boat, and, from\nthere, it oozed down to the rudder, impregnating the whole boat and\neverything in it on its way, and it oozed over the river, and saturated\nthe scenery and spoilt the atmosphere.  Sometimes a westerly oily wind\nblew, and at other times an easterly oily wind, and sometimes it blew a\nnortherly oily wind, and maybe a southerly oily wind; but whether it came\nfrom the Arctic snows, or was raised in the waste of the desert sands, it\ncame alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil.\n\nAnd that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset; and as for the moonbeams,\nthey positively reeked of paraffine.\n\nWe tried to get away from it at Marlow.  We left the boat by the bridge,\nand took a walk through the town to escape it, but it followed us.  The\nwhole town was full of oil.  We passed through the church-yard, and it\nseemed as if the people had been buried in oil.  The High Street stunk of\noil; we wondered how people could live in it.  And we walked miles upon\nmiles out Birmingham way; but it was no use, the country was steeped in\noil.\n\nAt the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field,\nunder a blasted oak, and took an awful oath (we had been swearing for a\nwhole week about the thing in an ordinary, middle-class way, but this was\na swell affair)\u00e2\u0080\u0094an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us in a\nboat again-except, of course, in case of sickness.\n\nTherefore, in the present instance, we confined ourselves to methylated\nspirit.  Even that is bad enough.  You get methylated pie and methylated\ncake.  But methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the system\nin large quantities than paraffine oil.\n\nFor other breakfast things, George suggested eggs and bacon, which were\neasy to cook, cold meat, tea, bread and butter, and jam.  For lunch, he\nsaid, we could have biscuits, cold meat, bread and butter, and jam\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\n_no cheese_.  Cheese, like oil, makes too much of itself.  It wants the\nwhole boat to itself.  It goes through the hamper, and gives a cheesy\nflavour to everything else there.  You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell whether you are eating\napple-pie or German sausage, or strawberries and cream.  It all seems\ncheese.  There is too much odour about cheese.\n\nI remember a friend of mine, buying a couple of cheeses at Liverpool.\nSplendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and with a two hundred\nhorse-power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry\nthree miles, and knock a man over at two hundred yards.  I was in\nLiverpool at the time, and my friend said that if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind he would\nget me to take them back with me to London, as he should not be coming up\nfor a day or two himself, and he did not think the cheeses ought to be\nkept much longer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, with pleasure, dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith pleasure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI called for the cheeses, and took them away in a cab.  It was a\nramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-winded\nsomnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of enthusiasm, during\nconversation, referred to as a horse.  I put the cheeses on the top, and\nwe started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the swiftest\nsteam-roller ever built, and all went merry as a funeral bell, until we\nturned the corner.  There, the wind carried a whiff from the cheeses full\non to our steed.  It woke him up, and, with a snort of terror, he dashed\noff at three miles an hour.  The wind still blew in his direction, and\nbefore we reached the end of the street he was laying himself out at the\nrate of nearly four miles an hour, leaving the cripples and stout old\nladies simply nowhere.\n\nIt took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the station;\nand I do not think they would have done it, even then, had not one of the\nmen had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his nose, and to\nlight a bit of brown paper.\n\nI took my ticket, and marched proudly up the platform, with my cheeses,\nthe people falling back respectfully on either side.  The train was\ncrowded, and I had to get into a carriage where there were already seven\nother people.  One crusty old gentleman objected, but I got in,\nnotwithstanding; and, putting my cheeses upon the rack, squeezed down\nwith a pleasant smile, and said it was a warm day.\n\nA few moments passed, and then the old gentleman began to fidget.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery close in here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite oppressive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man next him.\n\nAnd then they both began sniffing, and, at the third sniff, they caught\nit right on the chest, and rose up without another word and went out.\nAnd then a stout lady got up, and said it was disgraceful that a\nrespectable married woman should be harried about in this way, and\ngathered up a bag and eight parcels and went.  The remaining four\npassengers sat on for a while, until a solemn-looking man in the corner,\nwho, from his dress and general appearance, seemed to belong to the\nundertaker class, said it put him in mind of dead baby; and the other\nthree passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time, and hurt\nthemselves.\n\n                       [Picture: Railway carriage]\n\nI smiled at the black gentleman, and said I thought we were going to have\nthe carriage to ourselves; and he laughed pleasantly, and said that some\npeople made such a fuss over a little thing.  But even he grew strangely\ndepressed after we had started, and so, when we reached Crewe, I asked\nhim to come and have a drink.  He accepted, and we forced our way into\nthe buffet, where we yelled, and stamped, and waved our umbrellas for a\nquarter of an hour; and then a young lady came, and asked us if we wanted\nanything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, turning to my friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have half-a-crown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of brandy, neat, if you please, miss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nresponded.\n\nAnd he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another\ncarriage, which I thought mean.\n\nFrom Crewe I had the compartment to myself, though the train was crowded.\nAs we drew up at the different stations, the people, seeing my empty\ncarriage, would rush for it.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere y\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are, Maria; come along, plenty of\nroom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, Tom; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get in here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they would shout.  And they\nwould run along, carrying heavy bags, and fight round the door to get in\nfirst.  And one would open the door and mount the steps, and stagger back\ninto the arms of the man behind him; and they would all come and have a\nsniff, and then droop off and squeeze into other carriages, or pay the\ndifference and go first.\n\nFrom Euston, I took the cheeses down to my friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.  When his wife\ncame into the room she smelt round for an instant.  Then she said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it?  Tell me the worst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeses.  Tom bought them in Liverpool, and asked me to bring them\nup with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd I added that I hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with\nme; and she said that she was sure of that, but that she would speak to\nTom about it when he came back.\n\nMy friend was detained in Liverpool longer than he expected; and, three\ndays later, as he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t returned home, his wife called on me.  She said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did Tom say about those cheeses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place, and\nthat nobody was to touch them.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to touch them.  Had he smelt them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI thought he had, and added that he seemed greatly attached to them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think he would be upset,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she queried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I gave a man a sovereign\nto take them away and bury them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI answered that I thought he would never smile again.\n\nAn idea struck her.  She said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mind keeping them for him?  Let me send them round to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor myself I like the smell of cheese, and the\njourney the other day with them from Liverpool I shall ever look back\nupon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday.  But, in this world, we\nmust consider others.  The lady under whose roof I have the honour of\nresiding is a widow, and, for all I know, possibly an orphan too.  She\nhas a strong, I may say an eloquent, objection to being what she terms\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098put upon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  The presence of your husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeses in her house she\nwould, I instinctively feel, regard as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098put upon\u00e2\u0080\u0099; and it shall never\nbe said that I put upon the widow and the orphan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said my friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, rising, \u00e2\u0080\u009call I have to say is,\nthat I shall take the children and go to an hotel until those cheeses are\neaten.  I decline to live any longer in the same house with them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe kept her word, leaving the place in charge of the charwoman, who,\nwhen asked if she could stand the smell, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat smell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and who,\nwhen taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard, said she could\ndetect a faint odour of melons.  It was argued from this that little\ninjury could result to the woman from the atmosphere, and she was left.\n\nThe hotel bill came to fifteen guineas; and my friend, after reckoning\neverything up, found that the cheeses had cost him eight-and-sixpence a\npound.  He said he dearly loved a bit of cheese, but it was beyond his\nmeans; so he determined to get rid of them.  He threw them into the\ncanal; but had to fish them out again, as the bargemen complained.  They\nsaid it made them feel quite faint.  And, after that, he took them one\ndark night and left them in the parish mortuary.  But the coroner\ndiscovered them, and made a fearful fuss.\n\nHe said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the\ncorpses.\n\nMy friend got rid of them, at last, by taking them down to a sea-side\ntown, and burying them on the beach.  It gained the place quite a\nreputation.  Visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the\nair was, and weak-chested and consumptive people used to throng there for\nyears afterwards.\n\nFond as I am of cheese, therefore, I hold that George was right in\ndeclining to take any.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any tea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George (Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face fell at this); \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have a good round, square, slap-up meal at seven\u00e2\u0080\u0094dinner, tea, and\nsupper combined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris grew more cheerful.  George suggested meat and fruit pies, cold\nmeat, tomatoes, fruit, and green stuff.  For drink, we took some\nwonderful sticky concoction of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which you mixed with water and\ncalled lemonade, plenty of tea, and a bottle of whisky, in case, as\nGeorge said, we got upset.\n\nIt seemed to me that George harped too much on the getting-upset idea.\nIt seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.\n\nBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad we took the whisky.\n\nWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take beer or wine.  They are a mistake up the river.  They make\nyou feel sleepy and heavy.  A glass in the evening when you are doing a\nmouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough; but\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink when the sun is blazing down on your head, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\nhard work to do.\n\nWe made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it\nwas, before we parted that evening.  The next day, which was Friday, we\ngot them all together, and met in the evening to pack.  We got a big\nGladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and\nthe cooking utensils.  We moved the table up against the window, piled\neverything in a heap in the middle of the floor, and sat round and looked\nat it.\n\nI said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pack.\n\nI rather pride myself on my packing.  Packing is one of those many things\nthat I feel I know more about than any other person living.  (It\nsurprises me myself, sometimes, how many of these subjects there are.)  I\nimpressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they had\nbetter leave the whole matter entirely to me.  They fell into the\nsuggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it.  George\nput on a pipe and spread himself over the easy-chair, and Harris cocked\nhis legs on the table and lit a cigar.\n\nThis was hardly what I intended.  What I had meant, of course, was, that\nI should boss the job, and that Harris and George should potter about\nunder my directions, I pushing them aside every now and then with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, let me do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere you are, simple enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094really\nteaching them, as you might say.  Their taking it in the way they did\nirritated me.  There is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other\npeople sitting about doing nothing when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m working.\n\nI lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way.  He would loll\non the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together, following me\nround the room with his eyes, wherever I went.  He said it did him real\ngood to look on at me, messing about.  He said it made him feel that life\nwas not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through, but a noble task,\nfull of duty and stern work.  He said he often wondered now how he could\nhave gone on before he met me, never having anybody to look at while they\nworked.\n\nNow, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not like that.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit still and see another man slaving\nand working.  I want to get up and superintend, and walk round with my\nhands in my pockets, and tell him what to do.  It is my energetic nature.\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.\n\nHowever, I did not say anything, but started the packing.  It seemed a\nlonger job than I had thought it was going to be; but I got the bag\nfinished at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAin\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you going to put the boots in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\nAnd I looked round, and found I had forgotten them.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like\nHarris.  He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have said a word until I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d got the bag shut and\nstrapped, of course.  And George laughed\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of those irritating,\nsenseless, chuckle-headed, crack-jawed laughs of his.  They do make me so\nwild.\n\nI opened the bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was going\nto close it, a horrible idea occurred to me.  Had I packed my\ntooth-brush?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how it is, but I never do know whether I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\npacked my tooth-brush.\n\nMy tooth-brush is a thing that haunts me when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m travelling, and makes\nmy life a misery.  I dream that I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t packed it, and wake up in a\ncold perspiration, and get out of bed and hunt for it.  And, in the\nmorning, I pack it before I have used it, and have to unpack again to get\nit, and it is always the last thing I turn out of the bag; and then I\nrepack and forget it, and have to rush upstairs for it at the last moment\nand carry it to the railway station, wrapped up in my\npocket-handkerchief.\n\n[Picture: Boot] Of course I had to turn every mortal thing out now, and,\nof course, I could not find it.  I rummaged the things up into much the\nsame state that they must have been before the world was created, and\nwhen chaos reigned.  Of course, I found George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eighteen\ntimes over, but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find my own.  I put the things back one by\none, and held everything up and shook it.  Then I found it inside a boot.\nI repacked once more.\n\nWhen I had finished, George asked if the soap was in.  I said I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ncare a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; and I slammed\nthe bag to and strapped it, and found that I had packed my tobacco-pouch\nin it, and had to re-open it.  It got shut up finally at 10.5 p.m., and\nthen there remained the hampers to do.  Harris said that we should be\nwanting to start in less than twelve hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time, and thought that he and\nGeorge had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat down, and they had a\ngo.\n\nThey began in a light-hearted spirit, evidently intending to show me how\nto do it.  I made no comment; I only waited.  When George is hanged,\nHarris will be the worst packer in this world; and I looked at the piles\nof plates and cups, and kettles, and bottles and jars, and pies, and\nstoves, and cakes, and tomatoes, &c., and felt that the thing would soon\nbecome exciting.\n\nIt did.  They started with breaking a cup.  That was the first thing they\ndid.  They did that just to show you what they _could_ do, and to get you\ninterested.\n\nThen Harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed it,\nand they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon.\n\nAnd then it was George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn, and he trod on the butter.  I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say\nanything, but I came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched\nthem.  It irritated them more than anything I could have said.  I felt\nthat.  It made them nervous and excited, and they stepped on things, and\nput things behind them, and then couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find them when they wanted\nthem; and they packed the pies at the bottom, and put heavy things on\ntop, and smashed the pies in.\n\nThey upset salt over everything, and as for the butter!  I never saw two\nmen do more with one-and-twopence worth of butter in my whole life than\nthey did.  After George had got it off his slipper, they tried to put it\nin the kettle.  It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go in, and what _was_ in wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out.\nThey did scrape it out at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris\nsat on it, and it stuck to him, and they went looking for it all over the\nroom.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my oath I put it down on that chair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, staring at\nthe empty seat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\nThen they started round the room again looking for it; and then they met\nagain in the centre, and stared at one another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMost extraordinary thing I ever heard of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo mysterious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\nThen George got round at the back of Harris and saw it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, here it is all the time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, indignantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harris, spinning round.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStand still, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared George, flying after him.\n\nAnd they got it off, and packed it in the teapot.\n\nMontmorency was in it all, of course.  Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition in life, is\nto get in the way and be sworn at.  If he can squirm in anywhere where he\nparticularly is not wanted, and be a perfect nuisance, and make people\nmad, and have things thrown at his head, then he feels his day has not\nbeen wasted.\n\nTo get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him steadily for an hour,\nis his highest aim and object; and, when he has succeeded in\naccomplishing this, his conceit becomes quite unbearable.\n\nHe came and sat down on things, just when they were wanted to be packed;\nand he laboured under the fixed belief that, whenever Harris or George\nreached out their hand for anything, it was his cold, damp nose that they\nwanted.  He put his leg into the jam, and he worried the teaspoons, and\nhe pretended that the lemons were rats, and got into the hamper and\nkilled three of them before Harris could land him with the frying-pan.\n\nHarris said I encouraged him.  I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t encourage him.  A dog like that\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any encouragement.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the natural, original sin that is\nborn in him that makes him do things like that.\n\nThe packing was done at 12.50; and Harris sat on the big hamper, and said\nhe hoped nothing would be found broken.  George said that if anything was\nbroken it was broken, which reflection seemed to comfort him.  He also\nsaid he was ready for bed.  We were all ready for bed.  Harris was to\nsleep with us that night, and we went upstairs.\n\nWe tossed for beds, and Harris had to sleep with me.  He said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI said I generally preferred to sleep _inside_ a bed.\n\nHarris said it was old.\n\nGeorge said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat time shall I wake you fellows?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094six,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because I wanted to write some letters.\n\nHarris and I had a bit of a row over it, but at last split the\ndifference, and said half-past six.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWake us at 6.30, George,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said.\n\nGeorge made no answer, and we found, on going over, that he had been\nasleep for some time; so we placed the bath where he could tumble into it\non getting out in the morning, and went to bed ourselves.\n\n                    [Picture: Luggage with dog on top]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nMrs. P. arouses us.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George, the sluggard.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The \u00e2\u0080\u009cweather forecast\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nswindle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our luggage.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Depravity of the small boy.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The people gather round\nus.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We drive off in great style, and arrive at Waterloo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Innocence of\nSouth Western Officials concerning such worldly things as trains.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We are\nafloat, afloat in an open boat.\n\n[Picture: Mrs. Poppets] It was Mrs. Poppets that woke me up next morning.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried, starting up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, through the keyhole.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you was\na-oversleeping yourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI woke Harris, and told him.  He said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you wanted to get up at six?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you wake me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could I wake you, when you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wake me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorted.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we\nshan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get on the water till after twelve.

If I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t woke you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nhave lain there for the whole fortnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: George snoring] We snarled at one another in this strain for\nthe next few minutes, when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from\nGeorge.  It reminded us, for the first time since our being called, of\nhis existence.  There he lay\u00e2\u0080\u0094the man who had wanted to know what time he\nshould wake us\u00e2\u0080\u0094on his back, with his mouth wide open, and his knees stuck\nup.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why it should be, I am sure; but the sight of another man\nasleep in bed when I am up, maddens me.  It seems to me so shocking to\nsee the precious hours of a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life\u00e2\u0080\u0094the priceless moments that will\nnever come back to him again\u00e2\u0080\u0094being wasted in mere brutish sleep.\n\nThere was George, throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift of\ntime; his valuable life, every second of which he would have to account\nfor hereafter, passing away from him, unused.  He might have been up\nstuffing himself with eggs and bacon, irritating the dog, or flirting\nwith the slavey, instead of sprawling there, sunk in soul-clogging\noblivion.\n\nIt was a terrible thought.  Harris and I appeared to be struck by it at\nthe same instant.  We determined to save him, and, in this noble resolve,\nour own dispute was forgotten.  We flew across and slung the clothes off\nhim, and Harris landed him one with a slipper, and I shouted in his ear,\nand he awoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasermarrer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he observed, sitting up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet up, you fat-headed chunk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared Harris.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarter to ten.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shrieked, jumping out of bed into the bath; \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho the thunder\nput this thing here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath.\n\nWe finished dressing, and, when it came to the extras, we remembered that\nwe had packed the tooth-brushes and the brush and comb (that tooth-brush\nof mine will be the death of me, I know), and we had to go downstairs,\nand fish them out of the bag.  And when we had done that George wanted\nthe shaving tackle.  We told him that he would have to go without shaving\nthat morning, as we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to unpack that bag again for him, nor\nfor anyone like him.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be absurd.  How can I go into the City like this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was certainly rather rough on the City, but what cared we for human\nsuffering?  As Harris said, in his common, vulgar way, the City would\nhave to lump it.\n\n[Picture: Two dogs and umbrella] We went downstairs to breakfast.\nMontmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off, and they\nwere whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep.  We calmed them\nwith an umbrella, and sat down to chops and cold beef.\n\nHarris said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe great thing is to make a good breakfast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he started with a\ncouple of chops, saying that he would take these while they were hot, as\nthe beef could wait.\n\nGeorge got hold of the paper, and read us out the boating fatalities, and\nthe weather forecast, which latter prophesied \u00e2\u0080\u009crain, cold, wet to fine\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n(whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that may be),\n\u00e2\u0080\u009coccasional local thunder-storms, east wind, with general depression over\nthe Midland Counties (London and Channel).  Bar. falling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI do think that, of all the silly, irritating tomfoolishness by which we\nare plagued, this \u00e2\u0080\u009cweather-forecast\u00e2\u0080\u009d fraud is about the most aggravating.\nIt \u00e2\u0080\u009cforecasts\u00e2\u0080\u009d precisely what happened yesterday or the day before, and\nprecisely the opposite of what is going to happen to-day.\n\nI remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn by\nour paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeavy showers, with thunderstorms, may be expected to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it would say\non Monday, and so we would give up our picnic, and stop indoors all day,\nwaiting for the rain.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And people would pass the house, going off in\nwagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be, the sun shining\nout, and not a cloud to be seen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said, as we stood looking out at them through the window, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthey come home soaked!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get, and came back\nand stirred the fire, and got our books, and arranged our specimens of\nseaweed and cockle shells.  By twelve o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, with the sun pouring into\nthe room, the heat became quite oppressive, and we wondered when those\nheavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come in the afternoon, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said to each other.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, _won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ those people get wet.  What a lark!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, the landlady would come in to ask if we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going\nout, as it seemed such a lovely day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we replied, with a knowing chuckle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot we.  _We_ don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean\nto get wet\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd when the afternoon was nearly gone, and still there was no sign of\nrain, we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come\ndown all at once, just as the people had started for home, and were out\nof the reach of any shelter, and that they would thus get more drenched\nthan ever.  But not a drop ever fell, and it finished a grand day, and a\nlovely night after it.\n\nThe next morning we would read that it was going to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarm, fine to\nset-fair day; much heat;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we would dress ourselves in flimsy things,\nand go out, and, half-an-hour after we had started, it would commence to\nrain hard, and a bitterly cold wind would spring up, and both would keep\non steadily for the whole day, and we would come home with colds and\nrheumatism all over us, and go to bed.\n\nThe weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether.  I never can\nunderstand it.  The barometer is useless: it is as misleading as the\nnewspaper forecast.\n\nThere was one hanging up in a hotel at Oxford at which I was staying last\nspring, and, when I got there, it was pointing to \u00e2\u0080\u009cset fair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It was\nsimply pouring with rain outside, and had been all day; and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nquite make matters out.  I tapped the barometer, and it jumped up and\npointed to \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery dry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The Boots stopped as he was passing, and said he\nexpected it meant to-morrow.  I fancied that maybe it was thinking of the\nweek before last, but Boots said, No, he thought not.\n\nI tapped it again the next morning, and it went up still higher, and the\nrain came down faster than ever.  On Wednesday I went and hit it again,\nand the pointer went round towards \u00e2\u0080\u009cset fair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery dry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuch\nheat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d until it was stopped by the peg, and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go any further.  It\ntried its best, but the instrument was built so that it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prophesy\nfine weather any harder than it did without breaking itself.  It\nevidently wanted to go on, and prognosticate drought, and water famine,\nand sunstroke, and simooms, and such things, but the peg prevented it,\nand it had to be content with pointing to the mere commonplace \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery\ndry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile, the rain came down in a steady torrent, and the lower part of\nthe town was under water, owing to the river having overflowed.\n\nBoots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell of\ngrand weather _some time_, and read out a poem which was printed over the\ntop of the oracle, about\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong foretold, long last;\n    Short notice, soon past.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe fine weather never came that summer.  I expect that machine must have\nbeen referring to the following spring.\n\nThen there are those new style of barometers, the long straight ones.  I\nnever can make head or tail of those.  There is one side for 10 a.m.\nyesterday, and one side for 10 a.m. to-day; but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always get\nthere as early as ten, you know.  It rises or falls for rain and fine,\nwith much or less wind, and one end is \u00e2\u0080\u009cNly\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the other \u00e2\u0080\u009cEly\u00e2\u0080\u009d (what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nEly got to do with it?), and if you tap it, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you anything.\nAnd you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to correct it to sea-level, and reduce it to Fahrenheit,\nand even then I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the answer.\n\nBut who wants to be foretold the weather?  It is bad enough when it\ncomes, without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand.  The\nprophet we like is the old man who, on the particularly gloomy-looking\nmorning of some day when we particularly want it to be fine, looks round\nthe horizon with a particularly knowing eye, and says:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, sir, I think it will clear up all right.  It will break all right\nenough, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, he knows\u00e2\u0080\u009d, we say, as we wish him good-morning, and start off;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwonderful how these old fellows can tell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by the\ncircumstances of its _not_ clearing up, but continuing to rain steadily\nall day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we feel, \u00e2\u0080\u009che did his best.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor the man that prophesies us bad weather, on the contrary, we entertain\nonly bitter and revengeful thoughts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing to clear up, d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d we shout, cheerily, as we pass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no, sir; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settled down for the day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replies,\nshaking his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStupid old fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d we mutter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _he_ know about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And, if his\nportent proves correct, we come back feeling still more angry against\nhim, and with a vague notion that, somehow or other, he has had something\nto do with it.\n\nIt was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nblood-curdling readings about \u00e2\u0080\u009cBar. falling,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009catmospheric disturbance,\npassing in an oblique line over Southern Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpressure\nincreasing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to very much upset us: and so, finding that he could not\nmake us wretched, and was only wasting his time, he sneaked the cigarette\nthat I had carefully rolled up for myself, and went.\n\nThen Harris and I, having finished up the few things left on the table,\ncarted out our luggage on to the doorstep, and waited for a cab.\n\n                          [Picture: The luggage]\n\nThere seemed a good deal of luggage, when we put it all together.  There\nwas the Gladstone and the small hand-bag, and the two hampers, and a\nlarge roll of rugs, and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes, and\na few umbrellas, and then there was a melon by itself in a bag, because\nit was too bulky to go in anywhere, and a couple of pounds of grapes in\nanother bag, and a Japanese paper umbrella, and a frying pan, which,\nbeing too long to pack, we had wrapped round with brown paper.\n\nIt did look a lot, and Harris and I began to feel rather ashamed of it,\nthough why we should be, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see.  No cab came by, but the street\nboys did, and got interested in the show, apparently, and stopped.\n\nBiggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy was the first to come round.  Biggs is our greengrocer, and\nhis chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned and\nunprincipled errand-boys that civilisation has as yet produced.  If\nanything more than usually villainous in the boy-line crops up in our\nneighbourhood, we know that it is Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest.  I was told that, at\nthe time of the Great Coram Street murder, it was promptly concluded by\nour street that Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy (for that period) was at the bottom of it,\nand had he not been able, in reply to the severe cross-examination to\nwhich he was subjected by No. 19, when he called there for orders the\nmorning after the crime (assisted by No. 21, who happened to be on the\nstep at the time), to prove a complete _alibi_, it would have gone hard\nwith him.  I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy at that time, but, from what I have\nseen of them since, I should not have attached much importance to that\n_alibi_ myself.\n\nBiggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy, as I have said, came round the corner.  He was evidently in\na great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision, but, on catching\nsight of Harris and me, and Montmorency, and the things, he eased up and\nstared.  Harris and I frowned at him.  This might have wounded a more\nsensitive nature, but Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boys are not, as a rule, touchy.  He came\nto a dead stop, a yard from our step, and, leaning up against the\nrailings, and selecting a straw to chew, fixed us with his eye.  He\nevidently meant to see this thing out.\n\nIn another moment, the grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy passed on the opposite side of the\nstreet.  Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy hailed him:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHi! ground floor o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 42\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a-moving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy came across, and took up a position on the other side of\nthe step.  Then the young gentleman from the boot-shop stopped, and\njoined Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy; while the empty-can superintendent from \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Blue\nPosts\u00e2\u0080\u009d took up an independent position on the curb.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a-going to starve, are they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gentleman from the\nboot-shop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d want to take a thing or two with _you_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Blue\nPosts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you was a-going to cross the Atlantic in a small boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a-going to cross the Atlantic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d struck in Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a-going to find Stanley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy this time, quite a small crowd had collected, and people were asking\neach other what was the matter.  One party (the young and giddy portion\nof the crowd) held that it was a wedding, and pointed out Harris as the\nbridegroom; while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace\ninclined to the idea that it was a funeral, and that I was probably the\ncorpse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother.\n\nAt last, an empty cab turned up (it is a street where, as a rule, and\nwhen they are not wanted, empty cabs pass at the rate of three a minute,\nand hang about, and get in your way), and packing ourselves and our\nbelongings into it, and shooting out a couple of Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends,\nwho had evidently sworn never to forsake him, we drove away amidst the\ncheers of the crowd, Biggs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy shying a carrot after us for luck.\n\nWe got to Waterloo at eleven, and asked where the eleven-five started\nfrom.  Of course nobody knew; nobody at Waterloo ever does know where a\ntrain is going to start from, or where a train when it does start is\ngoing to, or anything about it.  The porter who took our things thought\nit would go from number two platform, while another porter, with whom he\ndiscussed the question, had heard a rumour that it would go from number\none.  The station-master, on the other hand, was convinced it would start\nfrom the local.\n\nTo put an end to the matter, we went upstairs, and asked the traffic\nsuperintendent, and he told us that he had just met a man, who said he\nhad seen it at number three platform.  We went to number three platform,\nbut the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was\nthe Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop.  But they were sure it\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say.\n\nThen our porter said he thought that must be it on the high-level\nplatform; said he thought he knew the train.  So we went to the\nhigh-level platform, and saw the engine-driver, and asked him if he was\ngoing to Kingston.  He said he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say for certain of course, but\nthat he rather thought he was.  Anyhow, if he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the 11.5 for\nKingston, he said he was pretty confident he was the 9.32 for Virginia\nWater, or the 10 a.m. express for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in that\ndirection, and we should all know when we got there.  We slipped\nhalf-a-crown into his hand, and begged him to be the 11.5 for Kingston.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody will ever know, on this line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you are, or where\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going.  You know the way, you slip off quietly and go to\nKingston.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, gents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the noble fellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I suppose\n_some_ train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to go to Kingston; and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it.  Gimme the\nhalf-crown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus we got to Kingston by the London and South-Western Railway.\n\nWe learnt, afterwards, that the train we had come by was really the\nExeter mail, and that they had spent hours at Waterloo, looking for it,\nand nobody knew what had become of it.\n\nOur boat was waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, and to it we\nwended our way, and round it we stored our luggage, and into it we\nstepped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you all right, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we answered; and with Harris at the sculls and I at the\ntiller-lines, and Montmorency, unhappy and deeply suspicious, in the\nprow, out we shot on to the waters which, for a fortnight, were to be our\nhome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nKingston.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Instructive remarks on early English history.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Instructive\nobservations on carved oak and life in general.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sad case of Stivvings,\njunior.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Musings on antiquity.\u00e2\u0080\u0094I forget that I am steering.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Interesting\nresult.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hampton Court Maze.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris as a guide.\n\nIt was a glorious morning, late spring or early summer, as you care to\ntake it, when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a deeper\ngreen; and the year seems like a fair young maid, trembling with strange,\nwakening pulses on the brink of womanhood.\n\nThe quaint back streets of Kingston, where they came down to the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nedge, looked quite picturesque in the flashing sunlight, the glinting\nriver with its drifting barges, the wooded towpath, the trim-kept villas\non the other side, Harris, in a red and orange blazer, grunting away at\nthe sculls, the distant glimpses of the grey old palace of the Tudors,\nall made a sunny picture, so bright but calm, so full of life, and yet so\npeaceful, that, early in the day though it was, I felt myself being\ndreamily lulled off into a musing fit.\n\nI mused on Kingston, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cKyningestun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it was once called in the days\nwhen Saxon \u00e2\u0080\u009ckinges\u00e2\u0080\u009d were crowned there.  Great C\u00c3\u00a6sar crossed the river\nthere, and the Roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands.  C\u00c3\u00a6sar,\nlike, in later years, Elizabeth, seems to have stopped everywhere: only\nhe was more respectable than good Queen Bess; he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put up at the\npublic-houses.\n\nShe was nuts on public-houses, was England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Virgin Queen.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nscarcely a pub. of any attractions within ten miles of London that she\ndoes not seem to have looked in at, or stopped at, or slept at, some time\nor other.  I wonder now, supposing Harris, say, turned over a new leaf,\nand became a great and good man, and got to be Prime Minister, and died,\nif they would put up signs over the public-houses that he had patronised:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHarris had a glass of bitter in this house;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarris had two of Scotch\ncold here in the summer of \u00e2\u0080\u009988;\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarris was chucked from here in\nDecember, 1886.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo, there would be too many of them!  It would be the houses that he had\nnever entered that would become famous.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly house in South London that\nHarris never had a drink in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The people would flock to it to see what\ncould have been the matter with it.\n\nHow poor weak-minded King Edwy must have hated Kyningestun!  The\ncoronation feast had been too much for him.  Maybe boar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head stuffed\nwith sugar-plums did not agree with him (it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t with me, I know),\nand he had had enough of sack and mead; so he slipped from the noisy\nrevel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved Elgiva.\n\nPerhaps, from the casement, standing hand-in-hand, they were watching the\ncalm moonlight on the river, while from the distant halls the boisterous\nrevelry floated in broken bursts of faint-heard din and tumult.\n\nThen brutal Odo and St. Dunstan force their rude way into the quiet room,\nand hurl coarse insults at the sweet-faced Queen, and drag poor Edwy back\nto the loud clamour of the drunken brawl.\n\nYears later, to the crash of battle-music, Saxon kings and Saxon revelry\nwere buried side by side, and Kingston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatness passed away for a\ntime, to rise once more when Hampton Court became the palace of the\nTudors and the Stuarts, and the royal barges strained at their moorings\non the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bank, and bright-cloaked gallants swaggered down the\nwater-steps to cry: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat Ferry, ho!  Gadzooks, gramercy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMany of the old houses, round about, speak very plainly of those days\nwhen Kingston was a royal borough, and nobles and courtiers lived there,\nnear their King, and the long road to the palace gates was gay all day\nwith clanking steel and prancing palfreys, and rustling silks and\nvelvets, and fair faces.  The large and spacious houses, with their\noriel, latticed windows, their huge fireplaces, and their gabled roofs,\nbreathe of the days of hose and doublet, of pearl-embroidered stomachers,\nand complicated oaths.  They were upraised in the days \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen men knew how\nto build.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The hard red bricks have only grown more firmly set with\ntime, and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try to go down\nthem quietly.\n\nSpeaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent carved\noak staircase in one of the houses in Kingston.  It is a shop now, in the\nmarket-place, but it was evidently once the mansion of some great\npersonage.  A friend of mine, who lives at Kingston, went in there to buy\na hat one day, and, in a thoughtless moment, put his hand in his pocket\nand paid for it then and there.\n\nThe shopman (he knows my friend) was naturally a little staggered at\nfirst; but, quickly recovering himself, and feeling that something ought\nto be done to encourage this sort of thing, asked our hero if he would\nlike to see some fine old carved oak.  My friend said he would, and the\nshopman, thereupon, took him through the shop, and up the staircase of\nthe house.  The balusters were a superb piece of workmanship, and the\nwall all the way up was oak-panelled, with carving that would have done\ncredit to a palace.\n\nFrom the stairs, they went into the drawing-room, which was a large,\nbright room, decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper of\na blue ground.  There was nothing, however, remarkable about the\napartment, and my friend wondered why he had been brought there.  The\nproprietor went up to the paper, and tapped it.  It gave forth a wooden\nsound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll carved oak, right up to the ceiling, just the\nsame as you saw on the staircase.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, great C\u00c3\u00a6sar! man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d expostulated my friend; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to say\nyou have covered over carved oak with blue wall-paper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the reply: \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was expensive work.  Had to match-board it all\nover first, of course.  But the room looks cheerful now.  It was awful\ngloomy before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I altogether blame the man (which is doubtless a great relief\nto his mind).  From his point of view, which would be that of the average\nhouseholder, desiring to take life as lightly as possible, and not that\nof the old-curiosity-shop maniac, there is reason on his side.  Carved\noak is very pleasant to look at, and to have a little of, but it is no\ndoubt somewhat depressing to live in, for those whose fancy does not lie\nthat way.  It would be like living in a church.\n\nNo, what was sad in his case was that he, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for carved oak,\nshould have his drawing-room panelled with it, while people who do care\nfor it have to pay enormous prices to get it.  It seems to be the rule of\nthis world.  Each person has what he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want, and other people have\nwhat he does want.\n\nMarried men have wives, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to want them; and young single\nfellows cry out that they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get them.  Poor people who can hardly\nkeep themselves have eight hearty children.  Rich old couples, with no\none to leave their money to, die childless.\n\nThen there are girls with lovers.  The girls that have lovers never want\nthem.  They say they would rather be without them, that they bother them,\nand why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they go and make love to Miss Smith and Miss Brown, who are\nplain and elderly, and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got any lovers?  They themselves don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nwant lovers.  They never mean to marry.\n\nIt does not do to dwell on these things; it makes one so sad.\n\nThere was a boy at our school, we used to call him Sandford and Merton.\nHis real name was Stivvings.  He was the most extraordinary lad I ever\ncame across.  I believe he really liked study.  He used to get into awful\nrows for sitting up in bed and reading Greek; and as for French irregular\nverbs there was simply no keeping him away from them.  He was full of\nweird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents and an\nhonour to the school; and he yearned to win prizes, and grow up and be a\nclever man, and had all those sorts of weak-minded ideas.  I never knew\nsuch a strange creature, yet harmless, mind you, as the babe unborn.\n\nWell, that boy used to get ill about twice a week, so that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go\nto school.  There never was such a boy to get ill as that Sandford and\nMerton.  If there was any known disease going within ten miles of him, he\nhad it, and had it badly.  He would take bronchitis in the dog-days, and\nhave hay-fever at Christmas.  After a six weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 period of drought, he\nwould be stricken down with rheumatic fever; and he would go out in a\nNovember fog and come home with a sunstroke.\n\nThey put him under laughing-gas one year, poor lad, and drew all his\nteeth, and gave him a false set, because he suffered so terribly with\ntoothache; and then it turned to neuralgia and ear-ache.  He was never\nwithout a cold, except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever;\nand he always had chilblains.  During the great cholera scare of 1871,\nour neighbourhood was singularly free from it.  There was only one\nreputed case in the whole parish: that case was young Stivvings.\n\nHe had to stop in bed when he was ill, and eat chicken and custards and\nhot-house grapes; and he would lie there and sob, because they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet him do Latin exercises, and took his German grammar away from him.\n\nAnd we other boys, who would have sacrificed ten terms of our school-life\nfor the sake of being ill for a day, and had no desire whatever to give\nour parents any excuse for being stuck-up about us, couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch so\nmuch as a stiff neck.  We fooled about in draughts, and it did us good,\nand freshened us up; and we took things to make us sick, and they made us\nfat, and gave us an appetite.  Nothing we could think of seemed to make\nus ill until the holidays began.  Then, on the breaking-up day, we caught\ncolds, and whooping cough, and all kinds of disorders, which lasted till\nthe term recommenced; when, in spite of everything we could man\u00c5\u0093uvre to\nthe contrary, we would get suddenly well again, and be better than ever.\n\nSuch is life; and we are but as grass that is cut down, and put into the\noven and baked.\n\nTo go back to the carved-oak question, they must have had very fair\nnotions of the artistic and the beautiful, our great-great-grandfathers.\nWhy, all our art treasures of to-day are only the dug-up commonplaces of\nthree or four hundred years ago.  I wonder if there is real intrinsic\nbeauty in the old soup-plates, beer-mugs, and candle-snuffers that we\nprize so now, or if it is only the halo of age glowing around them that\ngives them their charms in our eyes.  The \u00e2\u0080\u009cold blue\u00e2\u0080\u009d that we hang about\nour walls as ornaments were the common every-day household utensils of a\nfew centuries ago; and the pink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses\nthat we hand round now for all our friends to gush over, and pretend they\nunderstand, were the unvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the\neighteenth century would have given the baby to suck when he cried.\n\nWill it be the same in the future?  Will the prized treasures of to-day\nalways be the cheap trifles of the day before?  Will rows of our\nwillow-pattern dinner-plates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the\ngreat in the years 2000 and odd?  Will the white cups with the gold rim\nand the beautiful gold flower inside (species unknown), that our Sarah\nJanes now break in sheer light-heartedness of spirit, be carefully\nmended, and stood upon a bracket, and dusted only by the lady of the\nhouse?\n\n[Picture: China dog] That china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my\nfurnished lodgings.  It is a white dog.  Its eyes blue.  Its nose is a\ndelicate red, with spots.  Its head is painfully erect, its expression is\namiability carried to verge of imbecility.  I do not admire it myself.\nConsidered as a work of art, I may say it irritates me.  Thoughtless\nfriends jeer at it, and even my landlady herself has no admiration for\nit, and excuses its presence by the circumstance that her aunt gave it to\nher.\n\nBut in 200 years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time it is more than probable that that dog will be dug\nup from somewhere or other, minus its legs, and with its tail broken, and\nwill be sold for old china, and put in a glass cabinet.  And people will\npass it round, and admire it.  They will be struck by the wonderful depth\nof the colour on the nose, and speculate as to how beautiful the bit of\nthe tail that is lost no doubt was.\n\nWe, in this age, do not see the beauty of that dog.  We are too familiar\nwith it.  It is like the sunset and the stars: we are not awed by their\nloveliness because they are common to our eyes.  So it is with that china\ndog.  In 2288 people will gush over it.  The making of such dogs will\nhave become a lost art.  Our descendants will wonder how we did it, and\nsay how clever we were.  We shall be referred to lovingly as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose grand\nold artists that flourished in the nineteenth century, and produced those\nchina dogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009csampler\u00e2\u0080\u009d that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken of as\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctapestry of the Victorian era,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and be almost priceless.  The\nblue-and-white mugs of the present-day roadside inn will be hunted up,\nall cracked and chipped, and sold for their weight in gold, and rich\npeople will use them for claret cups; and travellers from Japan will buy\nup all the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPresents from Ramsgate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSouvenirs of Margate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that may\nhave escaped destruction, and take them back to Jedo as ancient English\ncurios.\n\nAt this point Harris threw away the sculls, got up and left his seat, and\nsat on his back, and stuck his legs in the air.  Montmorency howled, and\nturned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the things\ncame out.\n\nI was somewhat surprised, but I did not lose my temper.  I said,\npleasantly enough:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHulloa! what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that for?  Why\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo, on second thoughts, I will not repeat what Harris said.  I may have\nbeen to blame, I admit it; but nothing excuses violence of language and\ncoarseness of expression, especially in a man who has been carefully\nbrought up, as I know Harris has been.  I was thinking of other things,\nand forgot, as any one might easily understand, that I was steering, and\nthe consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the\ntow-path.  It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us and\nwhich was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found out after a\nwhile, and separated ourselves.\n\nHarris, however, said he had done enough for a bit, and proposed that I\nshould take a turn; so, as we were in, I got out and took the tow-line,\nand ran the boat on past Hampton Court.  What a dear old wall that is\nthat runs along by the river there!  I never pass it without feeling\nbetter for the sight of it.  Such a mellow, bright, sweet old wall; what\na charming picture it would make, with the lichen creeping here, and the\nmoss growing there, a shy young vine peeping over the top at this spot,\nto see what is going on upon the busy river, and the sober old ivy\nclustering a little farther down!  There are fifty shades and tints and\nhues in every ten yards of that old wall.  If I could only draw, and knew\nhow to paint, I could make a lovely sketch of that old wall, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often thought I should like to live at Hampton Court.  It looks so\npeaceful and so quiet, and it is such a dear old place to ramble round in\nthe early morning before many people are about.\n\nBut, there, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose I should really care for it when it came to\nactual practice.  It would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the\nevening, when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls, and\nthe echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors, and now\ndrew nearer, and now died away, and all was death-like silence, save the\nbeating of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own heart.\n\nWe are creatures of the sun, we men and women.  We love light and life.\nThat is why we crowd into the towns and cities, and the country grows\nmore and more deserted every year.  In the sunlight\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the daytime, when\nNature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and\nthe deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has\ngone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome, and\nwe get frightened, like children in a silent house.  Then we sit and sob,\nand long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human voices, and the\nanswering throb of human life.  We feel so helpless and so little in the\ngreat stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the night-wind.  There are\nso many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make us feel so sad.  Let us\ngather together in the great cities, and light huge bonfires of a million\ngas-jets, and shout and sing together, and feel brave.\n\n[Picture: People at Hampton Maze] Harris asked me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever been in the\nmaze at Hampton Court.  He said he went in once to show somebody else the\nway.  He had studied it up in a map, and it was so simple that it seemed\nfoolish\u00e2\u0080\u0094hardly worth the twopence charged for admission.  Harris said he\nthought that map must have been got up as a practical joke, because it\nwasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bit like the real thing, and only misleading.  It was a country\ncousin that Harris took in.  He said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just go in here, so that you can say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very\nsimple.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absurd to call it a maze.  You keep on taking the first\nturning to the right.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just walk round for ten minutes, and then go\nand get some lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey met some people soon after they had got inside, who said they had\nbeen there for three-quarters of an hour, and had had about enough of it.\nHarris told them they could follow him, if they liked; he was just going\nin, and then should turn round and come out again.  They said it was very\nkind of him, and fell behind, and followed.\n\nThey picked up various other people who wanted to get it over, as they\nwent along, until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze.  People\nwho had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out, or of ever\nseeing their home and friends again, plucked up courage at the sight of\nHarris and his party, and joined the procession, blessing him.  Harris\nsaid he should judge there must have been twenty people, following him,\nin all; and one woman with a baby, who had been there all the morning,\ninsisted on taking his arm, for fear of losing him.\n\nHarris kept on turning to the right, but it seemed a long way, and his\ncousin said he supposed it was a very big maze.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, one of the largest in Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it must be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the cousin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve walked a good two\nmiles already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris began to think it rather strange himself, but he held on until, at\nlast, they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago.  Harris said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\nimpossible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the woman with the baby said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she\nherself had taken it from the child, and thrown it down there, just\nbefore she met Harris.  She also added that she wished she never had met\nHarris, and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor.  That made\nHarris mad, and he produced his map, and explained his theory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe map may be all right enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the party, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you know\nwhereabouts in it we are now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, and suggested that the best thing to do would be to\ngo back to the entrance, and begin again.  For the beginning again part\nof it there was not much enthusiasm; but with regard to the advisability\nof going back to the entrance there was complete unanimity, and so they\nturned, and trailed after Harris again, in the opposite direction.  About\nten minutes more passed, and then they found themselves in the centre.\n\nHarris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been\naiming at; but the crowd looked dangerous, and he decided to treat it as\nan accident.\n\nAnyhow, they had got something to start from then.  They did know where\nthey were, and the map was once more consulted, and the thing seemed\nsimpler than ever, and off they started for the third time.\n\nAnd three minutes later they were back in the centre again.\n\nAfter that, they simply couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anywhere else.  Whatever way they\nturned brought them back to the middle.  It became so regular at length,\nthat some of the people stopped there, and waited for the others to take\na walk round, and come back to them.  Harris drew out his map again,\nafter a while, but the sight of it only infuriated the mob, and they told\nhim to go and curl his hair with it.  Harris said that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help\nfeeling that, to a certain extent, he had become unpopular.\n\nThey all got crazy at last, and sang out for the keeper, and the man came\nand climbed up the ladder outside, and shouted out directions to them.\nBut all their heads were, by this time, in such a confused whirl that\nthey were incapable of grasping anything, and so the man told them to\nstop where they were, and he would come to them.  They huddled together,\nand waited; and he climbed down, and came in.\n\nHe was a young keeper, as luck would have it, and new to the business;\nand when he got in, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find them, and he wandered about, trying\nto get to them, and then _he_ got lost.  They caught sight of him, every\nnow and then, rushing about the other side of the hedge, and he would see\nthem, and rush to get to them, and they would wait there for about five\nminutes, and then he would reappear again in exactly the same spot, and\nask them where they had been.\n\nThey had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner\nbefore they got out.\n\nHarris said he thought it was a very fine maze, so far as he was a judge;\nand we agreed that we would try to get George to go into it, on our way\nback.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nThe river in its Sunday garb.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dress on the river.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A chance for the\nmen.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Absence of taste in Harris.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blazer.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A day with the\nfashion-plate young lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mrs. Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomb.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The man who loves not\ngraves and coffins and skulls.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris mad.\u00e2\u0080\u0094His views on George and Banks\nand lemonade.\u00e2\u0080\u0094He performs tricks.\n\nIt was while passing through Moulsey Lock that Harris told me about his\nmaze experience.  It took us some time to pass through, as we were the\nonly boat, and it is a big lock.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I ever remember to have\nseen Moulsey Lock, before, with only one boat in it.  It is, I suppose,\nBoulter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even excepted, the busiest lock on the river.\n\nI have stood and watched it, sometimes, when you could not see any water\nat all, but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers, and gay caps, and\nsaucy hats, and many-coloured parasols, and silken rugs, and cloaks, and\nstreaming ribbons, and dainty whites; when looking down into the lock\nfrom the quay, you might fancy it was a huge box into which flowers of\nevery hue and shade had been thrown pell-mell, and lay piled up in a\nrainbow heap, that covered every corner.\n\nOn a fine Sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long, while,\nup the stream, and down the stream, lie, waiting their turn, outside the\ngates, long lines of still more boats; and boats are drawing near and\npassing away, so that the sunny river, from the Palace up to Hampton\nChurch, is dotted and decked with yellow, and blue, and orange, and\nwhite, and red, and pink.  All the inhabitants of Hampton and Moulsey\ndress themselves up in boating costume, and come and mouch round the lock\nwith their dogs, and flirt, and smoke, and watch the boats; and,\naltogether, what with the caps and jackets of the men, the pretty\ncoloured dresses of the women, the excited dogs, the moving boats, the\nwhite sails, the pleasant landscape, and the sparkling water, it is one\nof the gayest sights I know of near this dull old London town.\n\nThe river affords a good opportunity for dress.  For once in a way, we\nmen are able to show _our_ taste in colours, and I think we come out very\nnatty, if you ask me.  I always like a little red in my things\u00e2\u0080\u0094red and\nblack.  You know my hair is a sort of golden brown, rather a pretty shade\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been told, and a dark red matches it beautifully; and then I always\nthink a light-blue necktie goes so well with it, and a pair of those\nRussian-leather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the waist\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nhandkerchief looks so much better than a belt.\n\nHarris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow, but I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he is at all wise in this.  His complexion is too dark for\nyellows.  Yellows don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suit him: there can be no question about it.  I\nwant him to take to blue as a background, with white or cream for relief;\nbut, there! the less taste a person has in dress, the more obstinate he\nalways seems to be.  It is a great pity, because he will never be a\nsuccess as it is, while there are one or two colours in which he might\nnot really look so bad, with his hat on.\n\nGeorge has bought some new things for this trip, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m rather vexed\nabout them.  The blazer is loud.  I should not like George to know that I\nthought so, but there really is no other word for it.  He brought it home\nand showed it to us on Thursday evening.  We asked him what colour he\ncalled it, and he said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there was a name\nfor the colour.  The man had told him it was an Oriental design.  George\nput it on, and asked us what we thought of it.  Harris said that, as an\nobject to hang over a flower-bed in early spring to frighten the birds\naway, he should respect it; but that, considered as an article of dress\nfor any human being, except a Margate nigger, it made him ill.  George\ngot quite huffy; but, as Harris said, if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want his opinion, why\ndid he ask for it?\n\nWhat troubles Harris and myself, with regard to it, is that we are afraid\nit will attract attention to the boat.\n\n[Picture: Young lady] Girls, also, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look half bad in a boat, if\nprettily dressed.  Nothing is more fetching, to my thinking, than a\ntasteful boating costume.  But a \u00e2\u0080\u009cboating costume,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it would be as well\nif all ladies would understand, ought to be a costume that can be worn in\na boat, and not merely under a glass-case.  It utterly spoils an\nexcursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a\ngood deal more of their dress than of the trip.  It was my misfortune\nonce to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind.  We did have\na lively time!\n\nThey were both beautifully got up\u00e2\u0080\u0094all lace and silky stuff, and flowers,\nand ribbons, and dainty shoes, and light gloves.  But they were dressed\nfor a photographic studio, not for a river picnic.  They were the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cboating costumes\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a French fashion-plate.  It was ridiculous, fooling\nabout in them anywhere near real earth, air, and water.\n\nThe first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean.  We dusted\nall the seats for them, and then assured them that it was, but they\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe us.  One of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger of\nher glove, and showed the result to the other, and they both sighed, and\nsat down, with the air of early Christian martyrs trying to make\nthemselves comfortable up against the stake.  You are liable to\noccasionally splash a little when sculling, and it appeared that a drop\nof water ruined those costumes.  The mark never came out, and a stain was\nleft on the dress for ever.\n\nI was stroke.  I did my best.  I feathered some two feet high, and I\npaused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before returning\nthem, and I picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them into again each\ntime.  (Bow said, after a while, that he did not feel himself a\nsufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me, but that he would sit\nstill, if I would allow him, and study my stroke.  He said it interested\nhim.)  But, notwithstanding all this, and try as I would, I could not\nhelp an occasional flicker of water from going over those dresses.\n\nThe girls did not complain, but they huddled up close together, and set\ntheir lips firm, and every time a drop touched them, they visibly shrank\nand shuddered.  It was a noble sight to see them suffering thus in\nsilence, but it unnerved me altogether.  I am too sensitive.  I got wild\nand fitful in my rowing, and splashed more and more, the harder I tried\nnot to.\n\nI gave it up at last; I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d row bow.  Bow thought the arrangement\nwould be better too, and we changed places.  The ladies gave an\ninvoluntary sigh of relief when they saw me go, and quite brightened up\nfor a moment.  Poor girls! they had better have put up with me.  The man\nthey had got now was a jolly, light-hearted, thick-headed sort of a chap,\nwith about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a\nNewfoundland puppy.  You might look daggers at him for an hour and he\nwould not notice it, and it would not trouble him if he did.  He set a\ngood, rollicking, dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the\nboat like a fountain, and made the whole crowd sit up straight in no\ntime.  When he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses,\nhe would give a pleasant little laugh, and say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and offer them his handkerchief to wipe it\noff with.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of no consequence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the poor girls would murmur in reply, and\ncovertly draw rugs and coats over themselves, and try and protect\nthemselves with their lace parasols.\n\nAt lunch they had a very bad time of it.  People wanted them to sit on\nthe grass, and the grass was dusty; and the tree-trunks, against which\nthey were invited to lean, did not appear to have been brushed for weeks;\nso they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat on those, bolt\nupright.  Somebody, in walking about with a plate of beef-steak pie,\ntripped up over a root, and sent the pie flying.  None of it went over\nthem, fortunately, but the accident suggested a fresh danger to them, and\nagitated them; and, whenever anybody moved about, after that, with\nanything in his hand that could fall and make a mess, they watched that\nperson with growing anxiety until he sat down again.\n\n                          [Picture: Washing up]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow then, you girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our friend Bow to them, cheerily, after it\nwas all over, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome along, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to wash up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand him at first.  When they grasped the idea, they\nsaid they feared they did not know how to wash up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon show you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare fun!  You lie down on\nyour\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and sloush the things about\nin the water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got on dresses\nsuited to the work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he light-heartedly; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctuck \u00e2\u0080\u0099em up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he made them do it, too.  He told them that that sort of thing was\nhalf the fun of a picnic.  They said it was very interesting.\n\nNow I come to think it over, was that young man as dense-headed as we\nthought? or was he\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, impossible! there was such a simple, child-like\nexpression about him!\n\nHarris wanted to get out at Hampton Church, to go and see Mrs. Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntomb.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is Mrs. Thomas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow should I know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harris.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lady that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a funny\ntomb, and I want to see it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI objected.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it is that I am built wrong, but I\nnever did seem to hanker after tombstones myself.  I know that the proper\nthing to do, when you get to a village or town, is to rush off to the\nchurchyard, and enjoy the graves; but it is a recreation that I always\ndeny myself.  I take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly\nchurches behind wheezy old men, and reading epitaphs.  Not even the sight\nof a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what I call real\nhappiness.\n\nI shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability I am able to assume\nbefore exciting inscriptions, and by my lack of enthusiasm for the local\nfamily history, while my ill-concealed anxiety to get outside wounds\ntheir feelings.\n\nOne golden morning of a sunny day, I leant against the low stone wall\nthat guarded a little village church, and I smoked, and drank in deep,\ncalm gladness from the sweet, restful scene\u00e2\u0080\u0094the grey old church with its\nclustering ivy and its quaint carved wooden porch, the white lane winding\ndown the hill between tall rows of elms, the thatched-roof cottages\npeeping above their trim-kept hedges, the silver river in the hollow, the\nwooded hills beyond!\n\nIt was a lovely landscape.  It was idyllic, poetical, and it inspired me.\nI felt good and noble.  I felt I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be sinful and wicked any\nmore.  I would come and live here, and never do any more wrong, and lead\na blameless, beautiful life, and have silver hair when I got old, and all\nthat sort of thing.\n\nIn that moment I forgave all my friends and relations for their\nwickedness and cussedness, and I blessed them.  They did not know that I\nblessed them.  They went their abandoned way all unconscious of what I,\nfar away in that peaceful village, was doing for them; but I did it, and\nI wished that I could let them know that I had done it, because I wanted\nto make them happy.  I was going on thinking away all these grand, tender\nthoughts, when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice\ncrying out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, sur, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a-coming, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a-coming.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right, sur; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou be in a hurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI looked up, and saw an old bald-headed man hobbling across the\nchurchyard towards me, carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that\nshook and jingled at every step.\n\nI motioned him away with silent dignity, but he still advanced,\nscreeching out the while:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a-coming, sur, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a-coming.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little lame.  I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as spry as\nI used to be.  This way, sur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away, you miserable old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come as soon as I could, sur,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy missis never see\nyou till just this minute.  You follow me, sur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave me before I get over the wall, and slay\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe seemed surprised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to see the tombs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  I want to stop here, leaning up against this\ngritty old wall.  Go away, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disturb me.  I am chock full of\nbeautiful and noble thoughts, and I want to stop like it, because it\nfeels nice and good.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come fooling about, making me mad,\nchivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense\nof yours.  Go away, and get somebody to bury you cheap, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay half\nthe expense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was bewildered for a moment.  He rubbed his eyes, and looked hard at\nme.  I seemed human enough on the outside: he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it out.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYuise a stranger in these parts?  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: Graves] \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  _You_ wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if _I_ did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want to see the tombs\u00e2\u0080\u0094graves\u00e2\u0080\u0094folks been\nburied, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094coffins!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are an untruther,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, getting roused; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not want to see\ntombs\u00e2\u0080\u0094not your tombs.  Why should I?  We have graves of our own, our\nfamily has.  Why my uncle Podger has a tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery,\nthat is the pride of all that country-side; and my grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vault at\nBow is capable of accommodating eight visitors, while my great-aunt Susan\nhas a brick grave in Finchley Churchyard, with a headstone with a\ncoffee-pot sort of thing in bas-relief upon it, and a six-inch best white\nstone coping all the way round, that cost pounds.  When I want graves, it\nis to those places that I go and revel.  I do not want other folk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nWhen you yourself are buried, I will come and see yours.  That is all I\ncan do for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe burst into tears.  He said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone\nupon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of the\nremains of the figure of a man, and that another had some words, carved\nupon it, that nobody had ever been able to decipher.\n\nI still remained obdurate, and, in broken-hearted tones, he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come and see the memorial window?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI would not even see that, so he fired his last shot.  He drew near, and\nwhispered hoarsely:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a couple of skulls down in the crypt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome and see\nthose.  Oh, do come and see the skulls!  You are a young man out for a\nholiday, and you want to enjoy yourself.  Come and see the skulls!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen I turned and fled, and as I sped I heard him calling to me:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, come and see the skulls; come back and see the skulls!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris, however, revels in tombs, and graves, and epitaphs, and\nmonumental inscriptions, and the thought of not seeing Mrs. Thomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngrave made him crazy.  He said he had looked forward to seeing Mrs.\nThomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed\u00e2\u0080\u0094said he\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have joined if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for the idea of seeing Mrs.\nThomas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tomb.\n\nI reminded him of George, and how we had to get the boat up to Shepperton\nby five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock to meet him, and then he went for George.  Why was George\nto fool about all day, and leave us to lug this lumbering old top-heavy\nbarge up and down the river by ourselves to meet him?  Why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nGeorge come and do some work?  Why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he have got the day off, and\ncome down with us?  Bank be blowed!  What good was he at the bank?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never see him doing any work there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Harris, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhenever I go\nin.  He sits behind a bit of glass all day, trying to look as if he was\ndoing something.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of a man behind a bit of glass?  I have\nto work for my living.  Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he work.  What use is he there, and\nwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of their banks?  They take your money, and then, when you\ndraw a cheque, they send it back smeared all over with \u00e2\u0080\u0098No effects,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Refer to drawer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of that?  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sort of trick\nthey served me twice last week.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to stand it much longer.\nI shall withdraw my account.  If he was here, we could go and see that\ntomb.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the bank at all.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s larking about\nsomewhere, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing, leaving us to do all the work.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ngoing to get out, and have a drink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub.; and then he\nwent on about the river, and what was the good of the river, and was\neveryone who came on the river to die of thirst?\n\nIt is always best to let Harris have his head when he gets like this.\nThen he pumps himself out, and is quiet afterwards.\n\nI reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper, and a\ngallon-jar of water in the nose of the boat, and that the two only wanted\nmixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage.\n\nThen he flew off about lemonade, and \u00e2\u0080\u009csuch-like Sunday-school slops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as\nhe termed them, ginger-beer, raspberry syrup, &c., &c.  He said they all\nproduced dyspepsia, and ruined body and soul alike, and were the cause of\nhalf the crime in England.\n\nHe said he must drink something, however, and climbed upon the seat, and\nleant over to get the bottle.  It was right at the bottom of the hamper,\nand seemed difficult to find, and he had to lean over further and\nfurther, and, in trying to steer at the same time, from a topsy-turvy\npoint of view, he pulled the wrong line, and sent the boat into the bank,\nand the shock upset him, and he dived down right into the hamper, and\nstood there on his head, holding on to the sides of the boat like grim\ndeath, his legs sticking up into the air.  He dared not move for fear of\ngoing over, and had to stay there till I could get hold of his legs, and\nhaul him back, and that made him madder than ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nBlackmailing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The proper course to pursue.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Selfish boorishness of\nriver-side landowner.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNotice\u00e2\u0080\u009d boards.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Unchristianlike feelings of\nHarris.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How Harris sings a comic song.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A high-class party.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shameful\nconduct of two abandoned young men.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Some useless information.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George buys\na banjo.\n\nWe stopped under the willows by Kempton Park, and lunched.  It is a\npretty little spot there: a pleasant grass plateau, running along by the\nwater\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, and overhung by willows.  We had just commenced the third\ncourse\u00e2\u0080\u0094the bread and jam\u00e2\u0080\u0094when a gentleman in shirt-sleeves and a short\npipe came along, and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing.\nWe said we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to\nenable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point, but that, if\nhe assured us on his word as a gentleman that we _were_ trespassing, we\nwould, without further hesitation, believe it.\n\nHe gave us the required assurance, and we thanked him, but he still hung\nabout, and seemed to be dissatisfied, so we asked him if there was\nanything further that we could do for him; and Harris, who is of a chummy\ndisposition, offered him a bit of bread and jam.\n\nI fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from bread\nand jam; for he declined it quite gruffly, as if he were vexed at being\ntempted with it, and he added that it was his duty to turn us off.\n\nHarris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done, and asked the man\nwhat was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing it.\nHarris is what you would call a well-made man of about number one size,\nand looks hard and bony, and the man measured him up and down, and said\nhe would go and consult his master, and then come back and chuck us both\ninto the river.\n\nOf course, we never saw him any more, and, of course, all he really\nwanted was a shilling.  There are a certain number of riverside roughs\nwho make quite an income, during the summer, by slouching about the banks\nand blackmailing weak-minded noodles in this way.  They represent\nthemselves as sent by the proprietor.  The proper course to pursue is to\noffer your name and address, and leave the owner, if he really has\nanything to do with the matter, to summon you, and prove what damage you\nhave done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it.  But the majority\nof people are so intensely lazy and timid, that they prefer to encourage\nthe imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to it by the\nexertion of a little firmness.\n\nWhere it is really the owners that are to blame, they ought to be shown\nup.  The selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every year.\nIf these men had their way they would close the river Thames altogether.\nThey actually do this along the minor tributary streams and in the\nbackwaters.  They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and draw chains\nacross from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on every tree.  The\nsight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct in my nature.  I\nfeel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over the head of the man\nwho put it up, until I have killed him, and then I would bury him, and\nput the board up over the grave as a tombstone.\n\nI mentioned these feelings of mine to Harris, and he said he had them\nworse than that.  He said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who\ncaused the board to be put up, but that he should like to slaughter the\nwhole of his family and all his friends and relations, and then burn down\nhis house.  This seemed to me to be going too far, and I said so to\nHarris; but he answered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a bit of it.  Serve \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all jolly well right, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go and sing\ncomic songs on the ruins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI was vexed to hear Harris go on in this blood-thirsty strain.  We never\nought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere\nvindictiveness.  It was a long while before I could get Harris to take a\nmore Christian view of the subject, but I succeeded at last, and he\npromised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all events,\nand would not sing comic songs on the ruins.\n\nYou have never heard Harris sing a comic song, or you would understand\nthe service I had rendered to mankind.  It is one of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fixed ideas\nthat he _can_ sing a comic song; the fixed idea, on the contrary, among\nthose of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends who have heard him try, is that he _can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ and\nnever will be able to, and that he ought not to be allowed to try.\n\nWhen Harris is at a party, and is asked to sing, he replies: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I can\nonly sing a _comic_ song, you know;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he says it in a tone that\nimplies that his singing of _that_, however, is a thing that you ought to\nhear once, and then die.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that _is_ nice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the hostess.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo sing one, Mr. Harris;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nHarris gets up, and makes for the piano, with the beaming cheeriness of a\ngenerous-minded man who is just about to give somebody something.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, silence, please, everybody\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the hostess, turning round; \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr.\nHarris is going to sing a comic song!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how jolly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they murmur; and they hurry in from the conservatory,\nand come up from the stairs, and go and fetch each other from all over\nthe house, and crowd into the drawing-room, and sit round, all smirking\nin anticipation.\n\nThen Harris begins.\n\nWell, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look for much of a voice in a comic song.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nexpect correct phrasing or vocalization.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind if a man does\nfind out, when in the middle of a note, that he is too high, and comes\ndown with a jerk.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother about time.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind a man\nbeing two bars in front of the accompaniment, and easing up in the middle\nof a line to argue it out with the pianist, and then starting the verse\nafresh.  But you do expect the words.\n\nYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect a man to never remember more than the first three lines\nof the first verse, and to keep on repeating these until it is time to\nbegin the chorus.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect a man to break off in the middle of a\nline, and snigger, and say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very funny, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blest if he can\nthink of the rest of it, and then try and make it up for himself, and,\nafterwards, suddenly recollect it, when he has got to an entirely\ndifferent part of the song, and break off, without a word of warning, to\ngo back and let you have it then and there.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, I will just\ngive you an idea of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comic singing, and then you can judge of it\nfor yourself.\n\n[Picture: Harris] HARRIS (_standing up in front of piano and addressing\nthe expectant mob_): \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very old thing, you know.

He honestly\nimagines that he has given them a treat, and says he will sing another\ncomic song after supper.\n\nSpeaking of comic songs and parties, reminds me of a rather curious\nincident at which I once assisted; which, as it throws much light upon\nthe inner mental working of human nature in general, ought, I think, to\nbe recorded in these pages.\n\nWe were a fashionable and highly cultured party.  We had on our best\nclothes, and we talked pretty, and were very happy\u00e2\u0080\u0094all except two young\nfellows, students, just returned from Germany, commonplace young men, who\nseemed restless and uncomfortable, as if they found the proceedings slow.\nThe truth was, we were too clever for them.  Our brilliant but polished\nconversation, and our high-class tastes, were beyond them.  They were out\nof place, among us.  They never ought to have been there at all.\nEverybody agreed upon that, later on.\n\nWe played _morceaux_ from the old German masters.  We discussed\nphilosophy and ethics.  We flirted with graceful dignity.  We were even\nhumorous\u00e2\u0080\u0094in a high-class way.\n\nSomebody recited a French poem after supper, and we said it was\nbeautiful; and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in Spanish, and it\nmade one or two of us weep\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was so pathetic.\n\nAnd then those two young men got up, and asked us if we had ever heard\nHerr Slossenn Boschen (who had just arrived, and was then down in the\nsupper-room) sing his great German comic song.\n\nNone of us had heard it, that we could remember.\n\nThe young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written,\nand that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slossenn Boschen, whom they\nknew very well, to sing it.  They said it was so funny that, when Herr\nSlossenn Boschen had sung it once before the German Emperor, he (the\nGerman Emperor) had had to be carried off to bed.\n\nThey said nobody could sing it like Herr Slossenn Boschen; he was so\nintensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting a\ntragedy, and that, of course, made it all the funnier.  They said he\nnever once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything\nfunny\u00e2\u0080\u0094that would spoil it.  It was his air of seriousness, almost of\npathos, that made it so irresistibly amusing.\n\nWe said we yearned to hear it, that we wanted a good laugh; and they went\ndownstairs, and fetched Herr Slossenn Boschen.\n\nHe appeared to be quite pleased to sing it, for he came up at once, and\nsat down to the piano without another word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it will amuse you.  You will laugh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered the two young men, as\nthey passed through the room, and took up an unobtrusive position behind\nthe Professor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back.\n\nHerr Slossenn Boschen accompanied himself.  The prelude did not suggest a\ncomic song exactly.  It was a weird, soulful air.  It quite made one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nflesh creep; but we murmured to one another that it was the German\nmethod, and prepared to enjoy it.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand German myself.  I learned it at school, but forgot\nevery word of it two years after I had left, and have felt much better\never since.  Still, I did not want the people there to guess my\nignorance; so I hit upon what I thought to be rather a good idea.  I kept\nmy eye on the two young students, and followed them.  When they tittered,\nI tittered; when they roared, I roared; and I also threw in a little\nsnigger all by myself now and then, as if I had seen a bit of humour that\nhad escaped the others.  I considered this particularly artful on my\npart.\n\nI noticed, as the song progressed, that a good many other people seemed\nto have their eye fixed on the two young men, as well as myself.  These\nother people also tittered when the young men tittered, and roared when\nthe young men roared; and, as the two young men tittered and roared and\nexploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went\nexceedingly well.\n\nAnd yet that German Professor did not seem happy.  At first, when we\nbegan to laugh, the expression of his face was one of intense surprise,\nas if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted\nwith.  We thought this very funny: we said his earnest manner was half\nthe humour.  The slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he was\nwould have completely ruined it all.  As we continued to laugh, his\nsurprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation, and he scowled\nfiercely round upon us all (except upon the two young men who, being\nbehind him, he could not see).  That sent us into convulsions.  We told\neach other that it would be the death of us, this thing.  The words\nalone, we said, were enough to send us into fits, but added to his mock\nseriousness\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, it was too much!\n\nIn the last verse, he surpassed himself.  He glowered round upon us with\na look of such concentrated ferocity that, but for our being forewarned\nas to the German method of comic singing, we should have been nervous;\nand he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that, if\nwe had not known it was a funny song, we might have wept.\n\nHe finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter.  We said it was the\nfunniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives.  We said how strange\nit was that, in the face of things like these, there should be a popular\nnotion that the Germans hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any sense of humour.  And we asked the\nProfessor why he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t translate the song into English, so that the\ncommon people could understand it, and hear what a real comic song was\nlike.\n\nThen Herr Slossenn Boschen got up, and went on awful.  He swore at us in\nGerman (which I should judge to be a singularly effective language for\nthat purpose), and he danced, and shook his fists, and called us all the\nEnglish he knew.  He said he had never been so insulted in all his life.\n\nIt appeared that the song was not a comic song at all.  It was about a\nyoung girl who lived in the Hartz Mountains, and who had given up her\nlife to save her lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul; and he died, and met her spirit in the\nair; and then, in the last verse, he jilted her spirit, and went on with\nanother spirit\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not quite sure of the details, but it was something\nvery sad, I know.  Herr Boschen said he had sung it once before the\nGerman Emperor, and he (the German Emperor) had sobbed like a little\nchild.  He (Herr Boschen) said it was generally acknowledged to be one of\nthe most tragic and pathetic songs in the German language.\n\nIt was a trying situation for us\u00e2\u0080\u0094very trying.  There seemed to be no\nanswer.  We looked around for the two young men who had done this thing,\nbut they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately after\nthe end of the song.\n\nThat was the end of that party.  I never saw a party break up so quietly,\nand with so little fuss.  We never said good-night even to one another.\nWe came downstairs one at a time, walking softly, and keeping the shady\nside.  We asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers, and\nopened the door for ourselves, and slipped out, and got round the corner\nquickly, avoiding each other as much as possible.\n\nI have never taken much interest in German songs since then.\n\nWe reached Sunbury Lock at half-past three.  The river is sweetly pretty\njust there before you come to the gates, and the backwater is charming;\nbut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t attempt to row up it.\n\nI tried to do so once.  I was sculling, and asked the fellows who were\nsteering if they thought it could be done, and they said, oh, yes, they\nthought so, if I pulled hard.  We were just under the little foot-bridge\nthat crosses it between the two weirs, when they said this, and I bent\ndown over the sculls, and set myself up, and pulled.\n\nI pulled splendidly.  I got well into a steady rhythmical swing.  I put\nmy arms, and my legs, and my back into it.  I set myself a good, quick,\ndashing stroke, and worked in really grand style.  My two friends said it\nwas a pleasure to watch me.  At the end of five minutes, I thought we\nought to be pretty near the weir, and I looked up.  We were under the\nbridge, in exactly the same spot that we were when I began, and there\nwere those two idiots, injuring themselves by violent laughing.  I had\nbeen grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that\nbridge.  I let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams\nnow.\n\nWe sculled up to Walton, a rather large place for a riverside town.  As\nwith all riverside places, only the tiniest corner of it comes down to\nthe water, so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of some\nhalf-dozen houses, all told.  Windsor and Abingdon are the only towns\nbetween London and Oxford that you can really see anything of from the\nstream.  All the others hide round corners, and merely peep at the river\ndown one street: my thanks to them for being so considerate, and leaving\nthe river-banks to woods and fields and water-works.\n\nEven Reading, though it does its best to spoil and sully and make hideous\nas much of the river as it can reach, is good-natured enough to keep its\nugly face a good deal out of sight.\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar, of course, had a little place at Walton\u00e2\u0080\u0094a camp, or an\nentrenchment, or something of that sort.  C\u00c3\u00a6sar was a regular up-river\nman.  Also Queen Elizabeth, she was there, too.  You can never get away\nfrom that woman, go where you will.  Cromwell and Bradshaw (not the guide\nman, but the King Charles\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head man) likewise sojourned here.  They must\nhave been quite a pleasant little party, altogether.\n\nThere is an iron \u00e2\u0080\u009cscold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridle\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Walton Church.  They used these\nthings in ancient days for curbing women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongues.  They have given up\nthe attempt now.  I suppose iron was getting scarce, and nothing else\nwould be strong enough.\n\nThere are also tombs of note in the church, and I was afraid I should\nnever get Harris past them; but he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to think of them, and we\nwent on.  Above the bridge the river winds tremendously.  This makes it\nlook picturesque; but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point of\nview, and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man who\nis steering.\n\nYou pass Oatlands Park on the right bank here.  It is a famous old place.\nHenry VIII. stole it from some one or the other, I forget whom now, and\nlived in it.  There is a grotto in the park which you can see for a fee,\nand which is supposed to be very wonderful; but I cannot see much in it\nmyself.  The late Duchess of York, who lived at Oatlands, was very fond\nof dogs, and kept an immense number.  She had a special graveyard made,\nin which to bury them when they died, and there they lie, about fifty of\nthem, with a tombstone over each, and an epitaph inscribed thereon.\n\nWell, I dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average Christian\ndoes.\n\nAt \u00e2\u0080\u009cCorway Stakes\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094the first bend above Walton Bridge\u00e2\u0080\u0094was fought a battle\nbetween C\u00c3\u00a6sar and Cassivelaunus.  Cassivelaunus had prepared the river\nfor C\u00c3\u00a6sar, by planting it full of stakes (and had, no doubt, put up a\nnotice-board).  But C\u00c3\u00a6sar crossed in spite of this.  You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choke\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar off that river.  He is the sort of man we want round the backwaters\nnow.\n\nHalliford and Shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch\nthe river; but there is nothing remarkable about either of them.  There\nis a tomb in Shepperton churchyard, however, with a poem on it, and I was\nnervous lest Harris should want to get out and fool round it.  I saw him\nfix a longing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it, so I managed,\nby an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water, and in the\nexcitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my clumsiness, he\nforgot all about his beloved graves.\n\nAt Weybridge, the Wey (a pretty little stream, navigable for small boats\nup to Guildford, and one which I have always been making up my mind to\nexplore, and never have), the Bourne, and the Basingstoke Canal all enter\nthe Thames together.  The lock is just opposite the town, and the first\nthing that we saw, when we came in view of it, was George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blazer on one\nof the lock gates, closer inspection showing that George was inside it.\n\nMontmorency set up a furious barking, I shrieked, Harris roared; George\nwaved his hat, and yelled back.  The lock-keeper rushed out with a drag,\nunder the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock, and appeared\nannoyed at finding that no one had.\n\nGeorge had rather a curious oilskin-covered parcel in his hand.  It was\nround and flat at one end, with a long straight handle sticking out of\nit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009ca frying-pan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, with a strange, wild look glittering in his eyes;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey are all the rage this season; everybody has got them up the river.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a banjo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never knew you played the banjo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harris and I, in one breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot exactly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied George: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very easy, they tell me; and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the instruction book!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                     [Picture: George and the banjo]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nGeorge is introduced to work.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heathenish instincts of\ntow-lines.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ungrateful conduct of a double-sculling skiff.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Towers and\ntowed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A use discovered for lovers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Strange disappearance of an elderly\nlady.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Much haste, less speed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Being towed by girls: exciting\nsensation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The missing lock or the haunted river.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Music.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Saved!\n\nWe made George work, now we had got him.  He did not want to work, of\ncourse; that goes without saying.  He had had a hard time in the City, so\nhe explained.  Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to\npity, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a change;\nchange is good for everyone.  Out you get!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe could not in conscience\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conscience\u00e2\u0080\u0094object, though he\ndid suggest that, perhaps, it would be better for him to stop in the\nboat, and get tea ready, while Harris and I towed, because getting tea\nwas such a worrying work, and Harris and I looked tired.  The only reply\nwe made to this, however, was to pass him over the tow-line, and he took\nit, and stepped out.\n\n[Picture: Dog wrapped in tow-line] There is something very strange and\nunaccountable about a tow-line.  You roll it up with as much patience and\ncare as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers, and five\nminutes afterwards, when you pick it up, it is one ghastly,\nsoul-revolting tangle.\n\nI do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you took an\naverage tow-line, and stretched it out straight across the middle of a\nfield, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that, when you\nlooked round again, you would find that it had got itself altogether in a\nheap in the middle of the field, and had twisted itself up, and tied\nitself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all loops; and it\nwould take you a good half-hour, sitting down there on the grass and\nswearing all the while, to disentangle it again.\n\nThat is my opinion of tow-lines in general.  Of course, there may be\nhonourable exceptions; I do not say that there are not.  There may be\ntow-lines that are a credit to their profession\u00e2\u0080\u0094conscientious,\nrespectable tow-lines\u00e2\u0080\u0094tow-lines that do not imagine they are\ncrochet-work, and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the\ninstant they are left to themselves.  I say there _may_ be such\ntow-lines; I sincerely hope there are.  But I have not met with them.\n\nThis tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock.\nI would not let Harris touch it, because he is careless.  I had looped it\nround slowly and cautiously, and tied it up in the middle, and folded it\nin two, and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat.  Harris had\nlifted it up scientifically, and had put it into George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.  George\nhad taken it firmly, and held it away from him, and had begun to unravel\nit as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a new-born infant; and,\nbefore he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing was more like a badly-made\ndoor-mat than anything else.\n\nIt is always the same, and the same sort of thing always goes on in\nconnection with it.  The man on the bank, who is trying to disentangle\nit, thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up; and when a\nman up the river thinks a thing, he says it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-net of it?\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you wind it up properly,\nyou silly dummy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly with\nit, and lays it out flat on the tow-path, and runs round and round it,\ntrying to find the end.\n\nOn the other hand, the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of the\nmuddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was all right when you took it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaims indignantly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou think what you are doing?  You go about things in such a slap-dash\nstyle.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get a scaffolding pole entangled _you_ would!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang each\nother with the thing.  Ten minutes go by, and the first man gives a yell\nand goes mad, and dances on the rope, and tries to pull it straight by\nseizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and hauling at it.\nOf course, this only gets it into a tighter tangle than ever.  Then the\nsecond man climbs out of the boat and comes to help him, and they get in\neach other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, and hinder one another.  They both get hold of the same\nbit of line, and pull at it in opposite directions, and wonder where it\nis caught.  In the end, they do get it clear, and then turn round and\nfind that the boat has drifted off, and is making straight for the weir.\n\nThis really happened once to my own knowledge.  It was up by Boveney, one\nrather windy morning.  We were pulling down stream, and, as we came round\nthe bend, we noticed a couple of men on the bank.  They were looking at\neach other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable expression as I\nhave ever witnessed on any human countenance before or since, and they\nheld a long tow-line between them.  It was clear that something had\nhappened, so we eased up and asked them what was the matter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, our boat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone off!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they replied in an indignant tone.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just\ngot out to disentangle the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was\ngone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and\nungrateful act on the part of the boat.\n\nWe found the truant for them half a mile further down, held by some\nrushes, and we brought it back to them.  I bet they did not give that\nboat another chance for a week.\n\nI shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down the\nbank with a tow-line, looking for their boat.\n\nOne sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with\ntowing.  One of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers,\nwalking briskly along, deep in an animated discussion, while the man in\nthe boat, a hundred yards behind them, is vainly shrieking to them to\nstop, and making frantic signs of distress with a scull.  Something has\ngone wrong; the rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped\noverboard, or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating rapidly\ndown stream.\n\nHe calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.\n\n[Picture: Hat in the water] \u00e2\u0080\u009cHi! stop a minute, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouts\ncheerily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dropped my hat over-board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHi!  Tom\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dick! can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d not quite so affably this time.\n\nThen: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHi!  Confound _you_, you dunder-headed idiots!  Hi! stop!  Oh\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter that he springs up, and dances about, and roars himself red in the\nface, and curses everything he knows.  And the small boys on the bank\nstop and jeer at him, and pitch stones at him as he is pulled along past\nthem, at the rate of four miles an hour, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get out.\n\nMuch of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing would\nkeep remembering that they are towing, and give a pretty frequent look\nround to see how their man is getting on.  It is best to let one person\ntow.  When two are doing it, they get chattering, and forget, and the\nboat itself, offering, as it does, but little resistance, is of no real\nservice in reminding them of the fact.\n\nAs an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their\nwork, George told us, later on in the evening, when we were discussing\nthe subject after supper, of a very curious instance.\n\n                [Picture: Two people towing, boat adrift]\n\nHe and three other men, so he said, were sculling a very heavily laden\nboat up from Maidenhead one evening, and a little above Cookham lock they\nnoticed a fellow and a girl, walking along the towpath, both deep in an\napparently interesting and absorbing conversation.  They were carrying a\nboat-hook between them, and, attached to the boat-hook was a tow-line,\nwhich trailed behind them, its end in the water.  No boat was near, no\nboat was in sight.  There must have been a boat attached to that tow-line\nat some time or other, that was certain; but what had become of it, what\nghastly fate had overtaken it, and those who had been left in it, was\nburied in mystery.  Whatever the accident may have been, however, it had\nin no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman, who were towing.  They\nhad the boat-hook and they had the line, and that seemed to be all that\nthey thought necessary to their work.\n\nGeorge was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that moment, a\nbright idea flashed across him, and he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  He got the hitcher\ninstead, and reached over, and drew in the end of the tow-line; and they\nmade a loop in it, and put it over their mast, and then they tidied up\nthe sculls, and went and sat down in the stern, and lit their pipes.\n\nAnd that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a\nheavy boat up to Marlow.\n\nGeorge said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into one\nglance before, as when, at the lock, that young couple grasped the idea\nthat, for the last two miles, they had been towing the wrong boat.\nGeorge fancied that, if it had not been for the restraining influence of\nthe sweet woman at his side, the young man might have given way to\nviolent language.\n\nThe maiden was the first to recover from her surprise, and, when she did,\nshe clasped her hands, and said, wildly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Henry, then _where_ is auntie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid they ever recover the old lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Harris.\n\nGeorge replied he did not know.\n\nAnother example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and towed\nwas witnessed by George and myself once up near Walton.  It was where the\ntow-path shelves gently down into the water, and we were camping on the\nopposite bank, noticing things in general.  By-and-by a small boat came\nin sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace by a powerful\nbarge horse, on which sat a very small boy.  Scattered about the boat, in\ndreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fellows, the man who was\nsteering having a particularly restful appearance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to see him pull the wrong line,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured George, as they\npassed.  And at that precise moment the man did it, and the boat rushed\nup the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand linen\nsheets.  Two men, a hamper, and three oars immediately left the boat on\nthe larboard side, and reclined on the bank, and one and a half moments\nafterwards, two other men disembarked from the starboard, and sat down\namong boat-hooks and sails and carpet-bags and bottles.  The last man\nwent on twenty yards further, and then got out on his head.\n\nThis seemed to sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much easier, the\nsmall boy shouting at the top of his voice, and urging his steed into a\ngallop.  The fellows sat up and stared at one another.  It was some\nseconds before they realised what had happened to them, but, when they\ndid, they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop.  He, however, was\ntoo much occupied with the horse to hear them, and we watched them,\nflying after him, until the distance hid them from view.\n\nI cannot say I was sorry at their mishap.  Indeed, I only wish that all\nthe young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion\u00e2\u0080\u0094and plenty\ndo\u00e2\u0080\u0094could meet with similar misfortunes.  Besides the risk they run\nthemselves, they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat\nthey pass.  Going at the pace they do, it is impossible for them to get\nout of anybody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, or for anybody else to get out of theirs.\nTheir line gets hitched across your mast, and overturns you, or it\ncatches somebody in the boat, and either throws them into the water, or\ncuts their face open.  The best plan is to stand your ground, and be\nprepared to keep them off with the butt-end of a mast.\n\nOf all experiences in connection with towing, the most exciting is being\ntowed by girls.  It is a sensation that nobody ought to miss.  It takes\nthree girls to tow always; two hold the rope, and the other one runs\nround and round, and giggles.  They generally begin by getting themselves\ntied up.  They get the line round their legs, and have to sit down on the\npath and undo each other, and then they twist it round their necks, and\nare nearly strangled.  They fix it straight, however, at last, and start\noff at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace.  At the\nend of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless, and suddenly stop,\nand all sit down on the grass and laugh, and your boat drifts out to\nmid-stream and turns round, before you know what has happened, or can get\nhold of a scull.  Then they stand up, and are surprised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they say; \u00e2\u0080\u009che\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone right out into the middle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: Lady pinning up frock] They pull on pretty steadily for a bit,\nafter this, and then it all at once occurs to one of them that she will\npin up her frock, and they ease up for the purpose, and the boat runs\naground.\n\nYou jump up, and push it off, and you shout to them not to stop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they shout back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you roar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop\u00e2\u0080\u0094go on\u00e2\u0080\u0094go on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo back, Emily, and see what it is they want,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says one; and Emily comes\nback, and asks what it is.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says; \u00e2\u0080\u009canything happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right; only go on, you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t steer, if you keep stopping.  You must keep some way on\nthe boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep some what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome way\u00e2\u0080\u0094you must keep the boat moving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, all right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Are we doing it all right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem difficult at all.  I thought it was so hard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple enough.  You want to keep on steady at it, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see.  Give me out my red shawl, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under the cushion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou find the shawl, and hand it out, and by this time another one has\ncome back and thinks she will have hers too, and they take Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on\nchance, and Mary does not want it, so they bring it back and have a\npocket-comb instead.  It is about twenty minutes before they get off\nagain, and, at the next corner, they see a cow, and you have to leave the\nboat to chivy the cow out of their way.\n\nThere is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it.\n\nGeorge got the line right after a while, and towed us steadily on to\nPenton Hook.  There we discussed the important question of camping.  We\nhad decided to sleep on board that night, and we had either to lay up\njust about there, or go on past Staines.  It seemed early to think about\nshutting up then, however, with the sun still in the heavens, and we\nsettled to push straight on for Runnymead, three and a half miles\nfurther, a quiet wooded part of the river, and where there is good\nshelter.\n\nWe all wished, however, afterward that we had stopped at Penton Hook.\nThree or four miles up stream is a trifle, early in the morning, but it\nis a weary pull at the end of a long day.  You take no interest in the\nscenery during these last few miles.  You do not chat and laugh.  Every\nhalf-mile you cover seems like two.  You can hardly believe you are only\nwhere you are, and you are convinced that the map must be wrong; and,\nwhen you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles, and\nstill the lock is not in sight, you begin to seriously fear that somebody\nmust have sneaked it, and run off with it.\n\nI remember being terribly upset once up the river (in a figurative sense,\nI mean).  I was out with a young lady\u00e2\u0080\u0094cousin on my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we\nwere pulling down to Goring.  It was rather late, and we were anxious to\nget in\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least _she_ was anxious to get in.  It was half-past six when\nwe reached Benson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lock, and dusk was drawing on, and she began to get\nexcited then.  She said she must be in to supper.  I said it was a thing\nI felt I wanted to be in at, too; and I drew out a map I had with me to\nsee exactly how far it was.  I saw it was just a mile and a half to the\nnext lock\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wallingford\u00e2\u0080\u0094and five on from there to Cleeve.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right!\u00e2\u0080\u009d I said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be through the next lock before\nseven, and then there is only one more;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and I settled down and pulled\nsteadily away.\n\nWe passed the bridge, and soon after that I asked if she saw the lock.\nShe said no, she did not see any lock; and I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pulled on.\nAnother five minutes went by, and then I asked her to look again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any signs of a lock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I asked\nhesitatingly, not wishing to offend her.\n\nThe question did offend her, however, and she suggested that I had better\nlook for myself; so I laid down the sculls, and took a view.  The river\nstretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a mile; not a\nghost of a lock was to be seen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we have lost our way, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked my companion.\n\nI did not see how that was possible; though, as I suggested, we might\nhave somehow got into the weir stream, and be making for the falls.\n\nThis idea did not comfort her in the least, and she began to cry.  She\nsaid we should both be drowned, and that it was a judgment on her for\ncoming out with me.\n\nIt seemed an excessive punishment, I thought; but my cousin thought not,\nand hoped it would all soon be over.\n\nI tried to reassure her, and to make light of the whole affair.  I said\nthat the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied I\nwas, but that we should soon reach the lock now; and I pulled on for\nanother mile.\n\nThen I began to get nervous myself.  I looked again at the map.  There\nwas Wallingford lock, clearly marked, a mile and a half below Benson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nIt was a good, reliable map; and, besides, I recollected the lock myself.\nI had been through it twice.  Where were we?  What had happened to us?  I\nbegan to think it must be all a dream, and that I was really asleep in\nbed, and should wake up in a minute, and be told it was past ten.\n\nI asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream, and she replied\nthat she was just about to ask me the same question; and then we both\nwondered if we were both asleep, and if so, who was the real one that was\ndreaming, and who was the one that was only a dream; it got quite\ninteresting.\n\nI still went on pulling, however, and still no lock came in sight, and\nthe river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering\nshadows of night, and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny.  I\nthought of hobgoblins and banshees, and will-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-the-wisps, and those\nwicked girls who sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into\nwhirl-pools and things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew\nmore hymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the blessed\nstrains of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got \u00e2\u0080\u0099em on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d played, badly, on a concertina, and knew\nthat we were saved.\n\nI do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a rule; but, oh! how\nbeautiful the music seemed to us both then\u00e2\u0080\u0094far, far more beautiful than\nthe voice of Orpheus or the lute of Apollo, or anything of that sort\ncould have sounded.  Heavenly melody, in our then state of mind, would\nonly have still further harrowed us.  A soul-moving harmony, correctly\nperformed, we should have taken as a spirit-warning, and have given up\nall hope.  But about the strains of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got \u00e2\u0080\u0099em on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d jerked\nspasmodically, and with involuntary variations, out of a wheezy\naccordion, there was something singularly human and reassuring.\n\nThe sweet sounds drew nearer, and soon the boat from which they were\nworked lay alongside us.\n\nIt contained a party of provincial \u00e2\u0080\u0099Arrys and \u00e2\u0080\u0099Arriets, out for a\nmoonlight sail.  (There was not any moon, but that was not their fault.)\nI never saw more attractive, lovable people in all my life.  I hailed\nthem, and asked if they could tell me the way to Wallingford lock; and I\nexplained that I had been looking for it for the last two hours.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWallingford lock!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they answered.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cLor\u00e2\u0080\u0099 love you, sir, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done\naway with for over a year.  There ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no Wallingford lock now, sir.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re close to Cleeve now.  Blow me tight if \u00e2\u0080\u0099ere ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a gentleman been\nlooking for Wallingford lock, Bill!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had never thought of that.  I wanted to fall upon all their necks and\nbless them; but the stream was running too strong just there to allow of\nthis, so I had to content myself with mere cold-sounding words of\ngratitude.\n\nWe thanked them over and over again, and we said it was a lovely night,\nand we wished them a pleasant trip, and, I think, I invited them all to\ncome and spend a week with me, and my cousin said her mother would be so\npleased to see them.  And we sang the soldiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 chorus out of _Faust_,\nand got home in time for supper, after all.\n\n                     [Picture: People in rowing boat]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nOur first night.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Under canvas.\u00e2\u0080\u0094An appeal for help.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Contrariness of\ntea-kettles, how to overcome.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Supper.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How to feel virtuous.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wanted! a\ncomfortably-appointed, well-drained desert island, neighbourhood of South\nPacific Ocean preferred.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Funny thing that happened to George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father.\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nrestless night.\n\nHarris and I began to think that Bell Weir lock must have been done away\nwith after the same manner.  George had towed us up to Staines, and we\nhad taken the boat from there, and it seemed that we were dragging fifty\ntons after us, and were walking forty miles.  It was half-past seven when\nwe were through, and we all got in, and sculled up close to the left\nbank, looking out for a spot to haul up in.\n\nWe had originally intended to go on to Magna Charta Island, a sweetly\npretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, green valley,\nand to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round that\ntiny shore.  But, somehow, we did not feel that we yearned for the\npicturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day.  A bit of\nwater between a coal-barge and a gas-works would have quite satisfied us\nfor that night.  We did not want scenery.  We wanted to have our supper\nand go to bed.  However, we did pull up to the point\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cPicnic Point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it\nis called\u00e2\u0080\u0094and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a great elm-tree,\nto the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat.\n\nThen we thought we were going to have supper (we had dispensed with tea,\nso as to save time), but George said no; that we had better get the\ncanvas up first, before it got quite dark, and while we could see what we\nwere doing.  Then, he said, all our work would be done, and we could sit\ndown to eat with an easy mind.\n\nThat canvas wanted more putting up than I think any of us had bargained\nfor.  It looked so simple in the abstract.  You took five iron arches,\nlike gigantic croquet hoops, and fitted them up over the boat, and then\nstretched the canvas over them, and fastened it down: it would take quite\nten minutes, we thought.\n\nThat was an under-estimate.\n\nWe took up the hoops, and began to drop them into the sockets placed for\nthem.  You would not imagine this to be dangerous work; but, looking back\nnow, the wonder to me is that any of us are alive to tell the tale.  They\nwere not hoops, they were demons.  First they would not fit into their\nsockets at all, and we had to jump on them, and kick them, and hammer at\nthem with the boat-hook; and, when they were in, it turned out that they\nwere the wrong hoops for those particular sockets, and they had to come\nout again.\n\nBut they would not come out, until two of us had gone and struggled with\nthem for five minutes, when they would jump up suddenly, and try and\nthrow us into the water and drown us.  They had hinges in the middle,\nand, when we were not looking, they nipped us with these hinges in\ndelicate parts of the body; and, while we were wrestling with one side of\nthe hoop, and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty, the other side\nwould come behind us in a cowardly manner, and hit us over the head.\n\nWe got them fixed at last, and then all that was to be done was to\narrange the covering over them.  George unrolled it, and fastened one end\nover the nose of the boat.  Harris stood in the middle to take it from\nGeorge and roll it on to me, and I kept by the stern to receive it.  It\nwas a long time coming down to me.  George did his part all right, but it\nwas new work to Harris, and he bungled it.\n\nHow he managed it I do not know, he could not explain himself; but by\nsome mysterious process or other he succeeded, after ten minutes of\nsuperhuman effort, in getting himself completely rolled up in it.  He was\nso firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over, that he could not\nget out.  He, of course, made frantic struggles for freedom\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nbirthright of every Englishman,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, in doing so (I learned this\nafterwards), knocked over George; and then George, swearing at Harris,\nbegan to struggle too, and got _himself_ entangled and rolled up.\n\n[Picture: Watching and waiting] I knew nothing about all this at the\ntime.  I did not understand the business at all myself.  I had been told\nto stand where I was, and wait till the canvas came to me, and\nMontmorency and I stood there and waited, both as good as gold.  We could\nsee the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about, pretty\nconsiderably; but we supposed this was part of the method, and did not\ninterfere.\n\nWe also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it, and we\nguessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome, and concluded\nthat we would wait until things had got a little simpler before we joined\nin.\n\nWe waited some time, but matters seemed to get only more and more\ninvolved, until, at last, George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head came wriggling out over the side\nof the boat, and spoke up.\n\nIt said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive us a hand here, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, you cuckoo; standing there like a\nstuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffocated, you dummy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI never could withstand an appeal for help, so I went and undid them; not\nbefore it was time, either, for Harris was nearly black in the face.\n\nIt took us half an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard labour, after that, before it was properly\nup, and then we cleared the decks, and got out supper.  We put the kettle\non to boil, up in the nose of the boat, and went down to the stern and\npretended to take no notice of it, but set to work to get the other\nthings out.\n\nThat is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river.  If it sees\nthat you are waiting for it and are anxious, it will never even sing.\nYou have to go away and begin your meal, as if you were not going to have\nany tea at all.  You must not even look round at it.  Then you will soon\nhear it sputtering away, mad to be made into tea.\n\nIt is a good plan, too, if you are in a great hurry, to talk very loudly\nto each other about how you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need any tea, and are not going to have\nany.  You get near the kettle, so that it can overhear you, and then you\nshout out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any tea; do you, George?\u00e2\u0080\u009d to which George shouts\nback, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like tea; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have lemonade instead\u00e2\u0080\u0094tea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so\nindigestible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Upon which the kettle boils over, and puts the stove out.\n\nWe adopted this harmless bit of trickery, and the result was that, by the\ntime everything else was ready, the tea was waiting.  Then we lit the\nlantern, and squatted down to supper.\n\nWe wanted that supper.\n\nFor five-and-thirty minutes not a sound was heard throughout the length\nand breadth of that boat, save the clank of cutlery and crockery, and the\nsteady grinding of four sets of molars.  At the end of five-and-thirty\nminutes, Harris said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and took his left leg out from under him and\nput his right one there instead.\n\nFive minutes afterwards, George said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d too, and threw his plate out\non the bank; and, three minutes later than that, Montmorency gave the\nfirst sign of contentment he had exhibited since we had started, and\nrolled over on his side, and spread his legs out; and then I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nand bent my head back, and bumped it against one of the hoops, but I did\nnot mind it.  I did not even swear.\n\nHow good one feels when one is full\u00e2\u0080\u0094how satisfied with ourselves and with\nthe world!  People who have tried it, tell me that a clear conscience\nmakes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach does the business\nquite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily obtained.  One feels so\nforgiving and generous after a substantial and well-digested meal\u00e2\u0080\u0094so\nnoble-minded, so kindly-hearted.\n\nIt is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our digestive\norgans.  We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our stomach wills so.\nIt dictates to us our emotions, our passions.  After eggs and bacon, it\nsays, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWork!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  After beefsteak and porter, it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSleep!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  After a cup\nof tea (two spoonsful for each cup, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it stand more than\nthree minutes), it says to the brain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, rise, and show your strength.\nBe eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear eye, into Nature and\ninto life; spread your white wings of quivering thought, and soar, a\ngod-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath you, up through long\nlanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter hot muffins, it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe dull and soulless, like a beast of the\nfield\u00e2\u0080\u0094a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any ray of fancy,\nor of hope, or fear, or love, or life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And after brandy, taken in\nsufficient quantity, it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, come, fool, grin and tumble, that\nyour fellow-men may laugh\u00e2\u0080\u0094drivel in folly, and splutter in senseless\nsounds, and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will are\ndrowned, like kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe are but the veriest, sorriest slaves of our stomach.  Reach not after\nmorality and righteousness, my friends; watch vigilantly your stomach,\nand diet it with care and judgment.  Then virtue and contentment will\ncome and reign within your heart, unsought by any effort of your own; and\nyou will be a good citizen, a loving husband, and a tender father\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nnoble, pious man.\n\nBefore our supper, Harris and George and I were quarrelsome and snappy\nand ill-tempered; after our supper, we sat and beamed on one another, and\nwe beamed upon the dog, too.  We loved each other, we loved everybody.\nHarris, in moving about, trod on George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corn.  Had this happened before\nsupper, George would have expressed wishes and desires concerning\nHarris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate in this world and the next that would have made a\nthoughtful man shudder.\n\nAs it was, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSteady, old man; \u00e2\u0080\u0099ware wheat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Harris, instead of merely observing, in his most unpleasant tones,\nthat a fellow could hardly help treading on some bit of George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot, if\nhe had to move about at all within ten yards of where George was sitting,\nsuggesting that George never ought to come into an ordinary sized boat\nwith feet that length, and advising him to hang them over the side, as he\nwould have done before supper, now said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sorry, old chap; I\nhope I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: Smoking pipes] And George said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all;\u00e2\u0080\u009d that it was his\nfault; and Harris said no, it was his.\n\nIt was quite pretty to hear them.\n\nWe lit our pipes, and sat, looking out on the quiet night, and talked.\n\nGeorge said why could not we be always like this\u00e2\u0080\u0094away from the world,\nwith its sin and temptation, leading sober, peaceful lives, and doing\ngood.  I said it was the sort of thing I had often longed for myself; and\nwe discussed the possibility of our going away, we four, to some handy,\nwell-fitted desert island, and living there in the woods.\n\nHarris said that the danger about desert islands, as far as he had heard,\nwas that they were so damp: but George said no, not if properly drained.\n\nAnd then we got on to drains, and that put George in mind of a very funny\nthing that happened to his father once.  He said his father was\ntravelling with another fellow through Wales, and, one night, they\nstopped at a little inn, where there were some other fellows, and they\njoined the other fellows, and spent the evening with them.\n\nThey had a very jolly evening, and sat up late, and, by the time they\ncame to go to bed, they (this was when George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father was a very young\nman) were slightly jolly, too.  They (George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father and George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend) were to sleep in the same room, but in different beds.\nThey took the candle, and went up.  The candle lurched up against the\nwall when they got into the room, and went out, and they had to undress\nand grope into bed in the dark.  This they did; but, instead of getting\ninto separate beds, as they thought they were doing, they both climbed\ninto the same one without knowing it\u00e2\u0080\u0094one getting in with his head at the\ntop, and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the compass, and\nlying with his feet on the pillow.\n\nThere was silence for a moment, and then George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJoe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter, Tom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Joe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice from the other end of the\nbed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man in my bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father; \u00e2\u0080\u009chere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his feet on\nmy pillow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an extraordinary thing, Tom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the other; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nblest if there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a man in my bed, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to chuck him out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Joe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo am I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, valiantly.\n\nThere was a brief struggle, followed by two heavy bumps on the floor, and\nthen a rather doleful voice said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Tom!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow have you got on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, to tell you the truth, my man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chucked _me_ out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine!  I say, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think much of this inn, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the name of that inn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Pig and Whistle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, no, then it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d queried George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so curious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Harris, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut precisely that very same\nthing happened to _my_ father once at a country inn.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often heard\nhim tell the tale.  I thought it might have been the same inn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe turned in at ten that night, and I thought I should sleep well, being\ntired; but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  As a rule, I undress and put my head on the pillow,\nand then somebody bangs at the door, and says it is half-past eight: but,\nto-night, everything seemed against me; the novelty of it all, the\nhardness of the boat, the cramped position (I was lying with my feet\nunder one seat, and my head on another), the sound of the lapping water\nround the boat, and the wind among the branches, kept me restless and\ndisturbed.\n\nI did get to sleep for a few hours, and then some part of the boat which\nseemed to have grown up in the night\u00e2\u0080\u0094for it certainly was not there when\nwe started, and it had disappeared by the morning\u00e2\u0080\u0094kept digging into my\nspine.  I slept through it for a while, dreaming that I had swallowed a\nsovereign, and that they were cutting a hole in my back with a gimlet, so\nas to try and get it out.  I thought it very unkind of them, and I told\nthem I would owe them the money, and they should have it at the end of\nthe month.  But they would not hear of that, and said it would be much\nbetter if they had it then, because otherwise the interest would\naccumulate so.  I got quite cross with them after a bit, and told them\nwhat I thought of them, and then they gave the gimlet such an\nexcruciating wrench that I woke up.\n\nThe boat seemed stuffy, and my head ached; so I thought I would step out\ninto the cool night-air.  I slipped on what clothes I could find\nabout\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of my own, and some of George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094and crept under\nthe canvas on to the bank.\n\nIt was a glorious night.  The moon had sunk, and left the quiet earth\nalone with the stars.  It seemed as if, in the silence and the hush,\nwhile we her children slept, they were talking with her, their\nsister\u00e2\u0080\u0094conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for\nchildish human ears to catch the sound.\n\nThey awe us, these strange stars, so cold, so clear.  We are as children\nwhose small feet have strayed into some dim-lit temple of the god they\nhave been taught to worship but know not; and, standing where the echoing\ndome spans the long vista of the shadowy light, glance up, half hoping,\nhalf afraid to see some awful vision hovering there.\n\nAnd yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength, the night.  In its\ngreat presence, our small sorrows creep away, ashamed.  The day has been\nso full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and of\nbitter thoughts, and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us.  Then\nNight, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon our\nfevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers, and\nsmiles; and, though she does not speak, we know what she would say, and\nlay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, and the pain is gone.\n\nSometimes, our pain is very deep and real, and we stand before her very\nsilent, because there is no language for our pain, only a moan.  Night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nheart is full of pity for us: she cannot ease our aching; she takes our\nhand in hers, and the little world grows very small and very far away\nbeneath us, and, borne on her dark wings, we pass for a moment into a\nmightier Presence than her own, and in the wondrous light of that great\nPresence, all human life lies like a book before us, and we know that\nPain and Sorrow are but the angels of God.\n\nOnly those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that\nwondrous light; and they, when they return, may not speak of it, or tell\nthe mystery they know.\n\nOnce upon a time, through a strange country, there rode some goodly\nknights, and their path lay by a deep wood, where tangled briars grew\nvery thick and strong, and tore the flesh of them that lost their way\ntherein.  And the leaves of the trees that grew in the wood were very\ndark and thick, so that no ray of light came through the branches to\nlighten the gloom and sadness.\n\nAnd, as they passed by that dark wood, one knight of those that rode,\nmissing his comrades, wandered far away, and returned to them no more;\nand they, sorely grieving, rode on without him, mourning him as one dead.\n\nNow, when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been\njourneying, they stayed there many days, and made merry; and one night,\nas they sat in cheerful ease around the logs that burned in the great\nhall, and drank a loving measure, there came the comrade they had lost,\nand greeted them.  His clothes were ragged, like a beggar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and many sad\nwounds were on his sweet flesh, but upon his face there shone a great\nradiance of deep joy.\n\nAnd they questioned him, asking him what had befallen him: and he told\nthem how in the dark wood he had lost his way, and had wandered many days\nand nights, till, torn and bleeding, he had lain him down to die.\n\nThen, when he was nigh unto death, lo! through the savage gloom there\ncame to him a stately maiden, and took him by the hand and led him on\nthrough devious paths, unknown to any man, until upon the darkness of the\nwood there dawned a light such as the light of day was unto but as a\nlittle lamp unto the sun; and, in that wondrous light, our way-worn\nknight saw as in a dream a vision, and so glorious, so fair the vision\nseemed, that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more, but stood as one\nentranced, whose joy is deep as is the sea, whereof no man can tell the\ndepth.\n\nAnd the vision faded, and the knight, kneeling upon the ground, thanked\nthe good saint who into that sad wood had strayed his steps, so he had\nseen the vision that lay there hid.\n\nAnd the name of the dark forest was Sorrow; but of the vision that the\ngood knight saw therein we may not speak nor tell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nHow George, once upon a time, got up early in the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George,\nHarris, and Montmorency do not like the look of the cold water.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heroism\nand determination on the part of J.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and his shirt: story with a\nmoral.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris as cook.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Historical retrospect, specially inserted for the\nuse of schools.\n\nI woke at six the next morning; and found George awake too.  We both\nturned round, and tried to go to sleep again, but we could not.  Had\nthere been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep\nagain, but have got up and dressed then and there, we should have dropped\noff while we were looking at our watches, and have slept till ten.  As\nthere was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours\nat the very least, and our getting up at that time was an utter\nabsurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things\nin general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more\nwould be death to us.\n\nGeorge said that the same kind of thing, only worse, had happened to him\nsome eighteen months ago, when he was lodging by himself in the house of\na certain Mrs. Gippings.  He said his watch went wrong one evening, and\nstopped at a quarter-past eight.  He did not know this at the time\nbecause, for some reason or other, he forgot to wind it up when he went\nto bed (an unusual occurrence with him), and hung it up over his pillow\nwithout ever looking at the thing.\n\nIt was in the winter when this happened, very near the shortest day, and\na week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that it was still very dark\nwhen George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the time.  He\nreached up, and hauled down his watch.  It was a quarter-past eight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAngels and ministers of grace defend us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand here\nhave I got to be in the City by nine.  Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t somebody call me?  Oh,\nthis is a shame!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And he flung the watch down, and sprang out of bed,\nand had a cold bath, and washed himself, and dressed himself, and shaved\nhimself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the hot, and\nthen rushed and had another look at the watch.\n\nWhether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had\nstarted it, or how it was, George could not say, but certain it was that\nfrom a quarter-past eight it had begun to go, and now pointed to twenty\nminutes to nine.\n\nGeorge snatched it up, and rushed downstairs.  In the sitting-room, all\nwas dark and silent: there was no fire, no breakfast.  George said it was\na wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what he\nthought of her when he came home in the evening.  Then he dashed on his\ngreat-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made for the front door.\nThe door was not even unbolted.  George anathematized Mrs. G. for a lazy\nold woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not get up\nat a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door, and ran\nout.\n\nHe ran hard for a quarter of a mile, and at the end of that distance it\nbegan to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that there\nwere so few people about, and that there were no shops open.  It was\ncertainly a very dark and foggy morning, but still it seemed an unusual\ncourse to stop all business on that account.  _He_ had to go to business:\nwhy should other people stop in bed merely because it was dark and foggy!\n\nAt length he reached Holborn.  Not a shutter was down! not a bus was\nabout!  There were three men in sight, one of whom was a policeman; a\nmarket-cart full of cabbages, and a dilapidated looking cab.  George\npulled out his watch and looked at it: it was five minutes to nine!  He\nstood still and counted his pulse.  He stooped down and felt his legs.\nThen, with his watch still in his hand, he went up to the policeman, and\nasked him if he knew what the time was.\n\n[Picture: George and the policeman] \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man,\neyeing George up and down with evident suspicion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, if you listen you\nwill hear it strike.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only gone three!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George in an injured tone, when it had\nfinished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, and how many did you want it to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the constable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, nine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, showing his watch.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know where you live?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the guardian of public order,\nseverely.\n\nGeorge thought, and gave the address.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it is, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the man; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, you take my\nadvice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours with you; and\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have any more of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd George went home again, musing as he walked along, and let himself\nin.\n\nAt first, when he got in, he determined to undress and go to bed again;\nbut when he thought of the redressing and re-washing, and the having of\nanother bath, he determined he would not, but would sit up and go to\nsleep in the easy-chair.\n\nBut he could not get to sleep: he never felt more wakeful in his life; so\nhe lit the lamp and got out the chess-board, and played himself a game of\nchess.  But even that did not enliven him: it seemed slow somehow; so he\ngave chess up and tried to read.  He did not seem able to take any sort\nof interest in reading either, so he put on his coat again and went out\nfor a walk.\n\nIt was horribly lonesome and dismal, and all the policemen he met\nregarded him with undisguised suspicion, and turned their lanterns on him\nand followed him about, and this had such an effect upon him at last that\nhe began to feel as if he really had done something, and he got to\nslinking down the by-streets and hiding in dark doorways when he heard\nthe regulation flip-flop approaching.\n\nOf course, this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him than\never, and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was doing\nthere; and when he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he had merely come out for a\nstroll (it was then four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning), they looked as though\nthey did not believe him, and two plain-clothes constables came home with\nhim to see if he really did live where he had said he did.  They saw him\ngo in with his key, and then they took up a position opposite and watched\nthe house.\n\nHe thought he would light the fire when he got inside, and make himself\nsome breakfast, just to pass away the time; but he did not seem able to\nhandle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without dropping\nit or falling over it, and making such a noise that he was in mortal fear\nthat it would wake Mrs. G. up, and that she would think it was burglars\nand open the window and call \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolice!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then these two detectives\nwould rush in and handcuff him, and march him off to the police-court.\n\nHe was in a morbidly nervous state by this time, and he pictured the\ntrial, and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury, and\nnobody believing him, and his being sentenced to twenty years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 penal\nservitude, and his mother dying of a broken heart.  So he gave up trying\nto get breakfast, and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the\neasy-chair till Mrs. G came down at half-past seven.\n\nHe said he had never got up too early since that morning: it had been\nsuch a warning to him.\n\nWe had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while George had been telling\nme this true story, and on his finishing it I set to work to wake up\nHarris with a scull.  The third prod did it: and he turned over on the\nother side, and said he would be down in a minute, and that he would have\nhis lace-up boots.  We soon let him know where he was, however, by the\naid of the hitcher, and he sat up suddenly, sending Montmorency, who had\nbeen sleeping the sleep of the just right on the middle of his chest,\nsprawling across the boat.\n\nThen we pulled up the canvas, and all four of us poked our heads out over\nthe off-side, and looked down at the water and shivered.  The idea,\novernight, had been that we should get up early in the morning, fling off\nour rugs and shawls, and, throwing back the canvas, spring into the river\nwith a joyous shout, and revel in a long delicious swim.  Somehow, now\nthe morning had come, the notion seemed less tempting.  The water looked\ndamp and chilly: the wind felt cold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be first in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris at last.\n\nThere was no rush for precedence.  George settled the matter so far as he\nwas concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks.\nMontmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl, as if merely thinking of\nthe thing had given him the horrors; and Harris said it would be so\ndifficult to get into the boat again, and went back and sorted out his\ntrousers.\n\nI did not altogether like to give in, though I did not relish the plunge.\nThere might be snags about, or weeds, I thought.  I meant to compromise\nmatters by going down to the edge and just throwing the water over\nmyself; so I took a towel and crept out on the bank and wormed my way\nalong on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into the water.\n\n[Picture: In the Thames] It was bitterly cold.  The wind cut like a\nknife.  I thought I would not throw the water over myself after all.  I\nwould go back into the boat and dress; and I turned to do so; and, as I\nturned, the silly branch gave way, and I and the towel went in together\nwith a tremendous splash, and I was out mid-stream with a gallon of\nThames water inside me before I knew what had happened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Jove! old J.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I heard Harris say, as I came blowing to the\nsurface.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have the pluck to do it.  Did you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it all right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d sung out George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLovely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I spluttered back.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are duffers not to come in.  I\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have missed this for worlds.  Why won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you try it?  It only\nwants a little determination.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut I could not persuade them.\n\nRather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning.  I was very\ncold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my shirt on,\nI accidentally jerked it into the water.  It made me awfully wild,\nespecially as George burst out laughing.  I could not see anything to\nlaugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more.  I never\nsaw a man laugh so much.  I quite lost my temper with him at last, and I\npointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot he was;\nbut he only roared the louder.  And then, just as I was landing the\nshirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, which I\nhad mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck me for\nthe first time, and I began to laugh.  And the more I looked from\nGeorge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was\namused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back into\nthe water again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAr\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0094going to get it out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, between his shrieks.\n\nI could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at\nlast, between my peals I managed to jerk out:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my shirt\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _yours_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI never saw a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in all\nmy life before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he yelled, springing up.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou silly cuckoo!  Why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you be\nmore careful what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing?  Why the deuce don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go and dress on\nthe bank?  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not fit to be in a boat, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not.  Gimme the\nhitcher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI tried to make him see the fun of the thing, but he could not.  George\nis very dense at seeing a joke sometimes.\n\nHarris proposed that we should have scrambled eggs for breakfast.  He\nsaid he would cook them.  It seemed, from his account, that he was very\ngood at doing scrambled eggs.  He often did them at picnics and when out\non yachts.  He was quite famous for them.  People who had once tasted his\nscrambled eggs, so we gathered from his conversation, never cared for any\nother food afterwards, but pined away and died when they could not get\nthem.\n\nIt made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things, and we handed\nhim out the stove and the frying-pan and all the eggs that had not\nsmashed and gone over everything in the hamper, and begged him to begin.\n\nHe had some trouble in breaking the eggs\u00e2\u0080\u0094or rather not so much trouble in\nbreaking them exactly as in getting them into the frying-pan when broken,\nand keeping them off his trousers, and preventing them from running up\nhis sleeve; but he fixed some half-a-dozen into the pan at last, and then\nsquatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them about with a\nfork.\n\nIt seemed harassing work, so far as George and I could judge.  Whenever\nhe went near the pan he burned himself, and then he would drop everything\nand dance round the stove, flicking his fingers about and cursing the\nthings.  Indeed, every time George and I looked round at him he was sure\nto be performing this feat.  We thought at first that it was a necessary\npart of the culinary arrangements.\n\nWe did not know what scrambled eggs were, and we fancied that it must be\nsome Red Indian or Sandwich Islands sort of dish that required dances and\nincantations for its proper cooking.  Montmorency went and put his nose\nover it once, and the fat spluttered up and scalded him, and then _he_\nbegan dancing and cursing.  Altogether it was one of the most interesting\nand exciting operations I have ever witnessed.  George and I were both\nquite sorry when it was over.\n\nThe result was not altogether the success that Harris had anticipated.\nThere seemed so little to show for the business.  Six eggs had gone into\nthe frying-pan, and all that came out was a teaspoonful of burnt and\nunappetizing looking mess.\n\nHarris said it was the fault of the frying-pan, and thought it would have\ngone better if we had had a fish-kettle and a gas-stove; and we decided\nnot to attempt the dish again until we had those aids to housekeeping by\nus.\n\nThe sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished breakfast, and\nthe wind had dropped, and it was as lovely a morning as one could desire.\nLittle was in sight to remind us of the nineteenth century; and, as we\nlooked out upon the river in the morning sunlight, we could almost fancy\nthat the centuries between us and that ever-to-be-famous June morning of\n1215 had been drawn aside, and that we, English yeomen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sons in homespun\ncloth, with dirk at belt, were waiting there to witness the writing of\nthat stupendous page of history, the meaning whereof was to be translated\nto the common people some four hundred and odd years later by one Oliver\nCromwell, who had deeply studied it.\n\nIt is a fine summer morning\u00e2\u0080\u0094sunny, soft, and still.  But through the air\nthere runs a thrill of coming stir.  King John has slept at Duncroft\nHall, and all the day before the little town of Staines has echoed to the\nclang of armed men, and the clatter of great horses over its rough\nstones, and the shouts of captains, and the grim oaths and surly jests of\nbearded bowmen, billmen, pikemen, and strange-speaking foreign spearmen.\n\nGay-cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in, all\ntravel-stained and dusty.  And all the evening long the timid townsmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndoors have had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers, for\nwhom there must be found both board and lodging, and the best of both, or\nwoe betide the house and all within; for the sword is judge and jury,\nplaintiff and executioner, in these tempestuous times, and pays for what\nit takes by sparing those from whom it takes it, if it pleases it to do\nso.\n\nRound the camp-fire in the market-place gather still more of the Barons\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ntroops, and eat and drink deep, and bellow forth roystering drinking\nsongs, and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens into\nnight.  The firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piled-up arms and on\ntheir uncouth forms.  The children of the town steal round to watch them,\nwondering; and brawny country wenches, laughing, draw near to bandy\nale-house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers, so unlike the\nvillage swains, who, now despised, stand apart behind, with vacant grins\nupon their broad, peering faces.  And out from the fields around, glitter\nthe faint lights of more distant camps, as here some great lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfollowers lie mustered, and there false John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s French mercenaries hover\nlike crouching wolves without the town.\n\nAnd so, with sentinel in each dark street, and twinkling watch-fires on\neach height around, the night has worn away, and over this fair valley of\nold Thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close so big\nwith the fate of ages yet unborn.\n\nEver since grey dawn, in the lower of the two islands, just above where\nwe are standing, there has been great clamour, and the sound of many\nworkmen.  The great pavilion brought there yester eve is being raised,\nand carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats, while \u00e2\u0080\u0099prentices from\nLondon town are there with many-coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of\ngold and silver.\n\nAnd now, lo! down upon the road that winds along the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bank from\nStaines there come towards us, laughing and talking together in deep\nguttural bass, a half-a-score of stalwart halbert-men\u00e2\u0080\u0094Barons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 men,\nthese\u00e2\u0080\u0094and halt at a hundred yards or so above us, on the other bank, and\nlean upon their arms, and wait.\n\nAnd so, from hour to hour, march up along the road ever fresh groups and\nbands of armed men, their casques and breastplates flashing back the long\nlow lines of morning sunlight, until, as far as eye can reach, the way\nseems thick with glittering steel and prancing steeds.  And shouting\nhorsemen are galloping from group to group, and little banners are\nfluttering lazily in the warm breeze, and every now and then there is a\ndeeper stir as the ranks make way on either side, and some great Baron on\nhis war-horse, with his guard of squires around him, passes along to take\nhis station at the head of his serfs and vassals.\n\nAnd up the slope of Cooper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hill, just opposite, are gathered the\nwondering rustics and curious townsfolk, who have run from Staines, and\nnone are quite sure what the bustle is about, but each one has a\ndifferent version of the great event that they have come to see; and some\nsay that much good to all the people will come from this day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work; but\nthe old men shake their heads, for they have heard such tales before.\n\nAnd all the river down to Staines is dotted with small craft and boats\nand tiny coracles\u00e2\u0080\u0094which last are growing out of favour now, and are used\nonly by the poorer folk.  Over the rapids, where in after years trim Bell\nWeir lock will stand, they have been forced or dragged by their sturdy\nrowers, and now are crowding up as near as they dare come to the great\ncovered barges, which lie in readiness to bear King John to where the\nfateful Charter waits his signing.\n\nIt is noon, and we and all the people have been waiting patient for many\nan hour, and the rumour has run round that slippery John has again\nescaped from the Barons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grasp, and has stolen away from Duncroft Hall\nwith his mercenaries at his heels, and will soon be doing other work than\nsigning charters for his people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liberty.\n\nNot so!  This time the grip upon him has been one of iron, and he has\nslid and wriggled in vain.  Far down the road a little cloud of dust has\nrisen, and draws nearer and grows larger, and the pattering of many hoofs\ngrows louder, and in and out between the scattered groups of drawn-up\nmen, there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of gay-dressed lords\nand knights.  And front and rear, and either flank, there ride the yeomen\nof the Barons, and in the midst King John.\n\nHe rides to where the barges lie in readiness, and the great Barons step\nforth from their ranks to meet him.  He greets them with a smile and\nlaugh, and pleasant honeyed words, as though it were some feast in his\nhonour to which he had been invited.  But as he rises to dismount, he\ncasts one hurried glance from his own French mercenaries drawn up in the\nrear to the grim ranks of the Barons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 men that hem him in.\n\nIs it too late?  One fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman at his\nside, one cry to his French troops, one desperate charge upon the unready\nlines before him, and these rebellious Barons might rue the day they\ndared to thwart his plans!  A bolder hand might have turned the game even\nat that point.  Had it been a Richard there! the cup of liberty might\nhave been dashed from England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, and the taste of freedom held back\nfor a hundred years.\n\nBut the heart of King John sinks before the stern faces of the English\nfighting men, and the arm of King John drops back on to his rein, and he\ndismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge.  And the Barons\nfollow in, with each mailed hand upon the sword-hilt, and the word is\ngiven to let go.\n\nSlowly the heavy, bright-decked barges leave the shore of Runningmede.\nSlowly against the swift current they work their ponderous way, till,\nwith a low grumble, they grate against the bank of the little island that\nfrom this day will bear the name of Magna Charta Island.  And King John\nhas stepped upon the shore, and we wait in breathless silence till a\ngreat shout cleaves the air, and the great cornerstone in England\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntemple of liberty has, now we know, been firmly laid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nHenry VIII. and Anne Boleyn.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Disadvantages of living in same house with\npair of lovers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A trying time for the English nation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A night search for\nthe picturesque.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Homeless and houseless.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris prepares to die.\u00e2\u0080\u0094An angel\ncomes along.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Effect of sudden joy on Harris.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A little supper.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Lunch.\u00e2\u0080\u0094High\nprice for mustard.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A fearful battle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Maidenhead.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sailing.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Three\nfishers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We are cursed.\n\nI was sitting on the bank, conjuring up this scene to myself, when George\nremarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps I would not mind helping\nto wash up; and, thus recalled from the days of the glorious past to the\nprosaic present, with all its misery and sin, I slid down into the boat\nand cleaned out the frying-pan with a stick of wood and a tuft of grass,\npolishing it up finally with George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wet shirt.\n\nWe went over to Magna Charta Island, and had a look at the stone which\nstands in the cottage there and on which the great Charter is said to\nhave been signed; though, as to whether it really was signed there, or,\nas some say, on the other bank at \u00e2\u0080\u009cRunningmede,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I decline to commit\nmyself.  As far as my own personal opinion goes, however, I am inclined\nto give weight to the popular island theory.  Certainly, had I been one\nof the Barons, at the time, I should have strongly urged upon my comrades\nthe advisability of our getting such a slippery customer as King John on\nto the island, where there was less chance of surprises and tricks.\n\nThere are the ruins of an old priory in the grounds of Ankerwyke House,\nwhich is close to Picnic Point, and it was round about the grounds of\nthis old priory that Henry VIII. is said to have waited for and met Anne\nBoleyn.  He also used to meet her at Hever Castle in Kent, and also\nsomewhere near St. Albans.  It must have been difficult for the people of\nEngland in those days to have found a spot where these thoughtless young\nfolk were _not_ spooning.\n\nHave you ever been in a house where there are a couple courting?  It is\nmost trying.  You think you will go and sit in the drawing-room, and you\nmarch off there.  As you open the door, you hear a noise as if somebody\nhad suddenly recollected something, and, when you get in, Emily is over\nby the window, full of interest in the opposite side of the road, and\nyour friend, John Edward, is at the other end of the room with his whole\nsoul held in thrall by photographs of other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatives.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d you say, pausing at the door, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anybody was here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Emily, coldly, in a tone which implies that she\ndoes not believe you.\n\nYou hang about for a bit, then you say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very dark.  Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you light the gas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJohn Edward says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed it; and Emily says that papa\ndoes not like the gas lit in the afternoon.\n\nYou tell them one or two items of news, and give them your views and\nopinions on the Irish question; but this does not appear to interest\nthem.  All they remark on any subject is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  And, after ten minutes of such style of\nconversation, you edge up to the door, and slip out, and are surprised to\nfind that the door immediately closes behind you, and shuts itself,\nwithout your having touched it.\n\nHalf an hour later, you think you will try a pipe in the conservatory.\nThe only chair in the place is occupied by Emily; and John Edward, if the\nlanguage of clothes can be relied upon, has evidently been sitting on the\nfloor.  They do not speak, but they give you a look that says all that\ncan be said in a civilised community; and you back out promptly and shut\nthe door behind you.\n\nYou are afraid to poke your nose into any room in the house now; so,\nafter walking up and down the stairs for a while, you go and sit in your\nown bedroom.  This becomes uninteresting, however, after a time, and so\nyou put on your hat and stroll out into the garden.  You walk down the\npath, and as you pass the summer-house you glance in, and there are those\ntwo young idiots, huddled up into one corner of it; and they see you, and\nare evidently under the idea that, for some wicked purpose of your own,\nyou are following them about.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they have a special room for this sort of thing, and make\npeople keep to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d you mutter; and you rush back to the hall and get\nyour umbrella and go out.\n\nIt must have been much like this when that foolish boy Henry VIII. was\ncourting his little Anne.  People in Buckinghamshire would have come upon\nthem unexpectedly when they were mooning round Windsor and Wraysbury, and\nhave exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! you here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Henry would have blushed and said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just come over to see a man;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Anne would have said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad to see you!  Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it funny?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just met Mr. Henry VIII.\nin the lane, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going the same way I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen those people would have gone away and said to themselves: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbetter get out of here while this billing and cooing is on.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go\ndown to Kent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they would go to Kent, and the first thing they would see in Kent,\nwhen they got there, would be Henry and Anne fooling round Hever Castle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, drat this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they would have said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go away.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nstand any more of it.  Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go to St. Albans\u00e2\u0080\u0094nice quiet place, St.\nAlbans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                          [Picture: River scene]\n\nAnd when they reached St. Albans, there would be that wretched couple,\nkissing under the Abbey walls.  Then these folks would go and be pirates\nuntil the marriage was over.\n\nFrom Picnic Point to Old Windsor Lock is a delightful bit of the river.\nA shady road, dotted here and there with dainty little cottages, runs by\nthe bank up to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBells of Ouseley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a picturesque inn, as most\nup-river inns are, and a place where a very good glass of ale may be\ndrunk\u00e2\u0080\u0094so Harris says; and on a matter of this kind you can take Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nword.  Old Windsor is a famous spot in its way.  Edward the Confessor had\na palace here, and here the great Earl Godwin was proved guilty by the\njustice of that age of having encompassed the death of the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbrother.  Earl Godwin broke a piece of bread and held it in his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I am guilty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the Earl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay this bread choke me when I eat it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he put the bread into his mouth and swallowed it, and it choked him,\nand he died.\n\nAfter you pass Old Windsor, the river is somewhat uninteresting, and does\nnot become itself again until you are nearing Boveney.  George and I\ntowed up past the Home Park, which stretches along the right bank from\nAlbert to Victoria Bridge; and as we were passing Datchet, George asked\nme if I remembered our first trip up the river, and when we landed at\nDatchet at ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night, and wanted to go to bed.\n\nI answered that I did remember it.  It will be some time before I forget\nit.\n\nIt was the Saturday before the August Bank Holiday.  We were tired and\nhungry, we same three, and when we got to Datchet we took out the hamper,\nthe two bags, and the rugs and coats, and such like things, and started\noff to look for diggings.  We passed a very pretty little hotel, with\nclematis and creeper over the porch; but there was no honeysuckle about\nit, and, for some reason or other, I had got my mind fixed on\nhoneysuckle, and I said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go in there!  Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go on a bit further, and see if\nthere isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one with honeysuckle over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we went on till we came to another hotel.  That was a very nice hotel,\ntoo, and it had honey-suckle on it, round at the side; but Harris did not\nlike the look of a man who was leaning against the front door.  He said\nhe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look a nice man at all, and he wore ugly boots: so we went on\nfurther.  We went a goodish way without coming across any more hotels,\nand then we met a man, and asked him to direct us to a few.\n\nHe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you are coming away from them.  You must turn right round and go\nback, and then you will come to the Stag.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, we had been there, and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it\u00e2\u0080\u0094no honeysuckle over it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Manor House, just opposite.  Have you\ntried that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris replied that we did not want to go there\u00e2\u0080\u0094didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the looks of\na man who was stopping there\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris did not like the colour of his hair,\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like his boots, either.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our informant;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause they are the only two inns in the place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo other inns!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat on earth are we to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Harris.\n\nThen George spoke up.  He said Harris and I could get an hotel built for\nus, if we liked, and have some people made to put in.  For his part, he\nwas going back to the Stag.\n\nThe greatest minds never realise their ideals in any matter; and Harris\nand I sighed over the hollowness of all earthly desires, and followed\nGeorge.\n\nWe took our traps into the Stag, and laid them down in the hall.\n\nThe landlord came up and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood evening, gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, good evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe want three beds, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery sorry, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the landlord; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t manage\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, never mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo will do.  Two of us can sleep\nin one bed, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, turning to Harris and me.\n\nHarris said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes;\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought George and I could sleep in one bed\nvery easily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery sorry, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d again repeated the landlord: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we really haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngot a bed vacant in the whole house.  In fact, we are putting two, and\neven three gentlemen in one bed, as it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis staggered us for a bit.\n\nBut Harris, who is an old traveller, rose to the occasion, and, laughing\ncheerily, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.  We must rough it.  You must give us a\nshake-down in the billiard-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery sorry, sir.  Three gentlemen sleeping on the billiard-table\nalready, and two in the coffee-room.  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly take you in\nto-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe picked up our things, and went over to the Manor House.  It was a\npretty little place.  I said I thought I should like it better than the\nother house; and Harris said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it would be all right, and we\nneedn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look at the man with the red hair; besides, the poor fellow\ncouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help having red hair.\n\nHarris spoke quite kindly and sensibly about it.\n\nThe people at the Manor House did not wait to hear us talk.  The landlady\nmet us on the doorstep with the greeting that we were the fourteenth\nparty she had turned away within the last hour and a half.  As for our\nmeek suggestions of stables, billiard-room, or coal-cellars, she laughed\nthem all to scorn: all these nooks had been snatched up long ago.\n\nDid she know of any place in the whole village where we could get shelter\nfor the night?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind roughing it\u00e2\u0080\u0094she did not recommend it, mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nthere was a little beershop half a mile down the Eton road\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe waited to hear no more; we caught up the hamper and the bags, and the\ncoats and rugs, and parcels, and ran.  The distance seemed more like a\nmile than half a mile, but we reached the place at last, and rushed,\npanting, into the bar.\n\nThe people at the beershop were rude.  They merely laughed at us.  There\nwere only three beds in the whole house, and they had seven single\ngentlemen and two married couples sleeping there already.  A kind-hearted\nbargeman, however, who happened to be in the tap-room, thought we might\ntry the grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, next door to the Stag, and we went back.\n\nThe grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was full.  An old woman we met in the shop then kindly took\nus along with her for a quarter of a mile, to a lady friend of hers, who\noccasionally let rooms to gentlemen.\n\nThis old woman walked very slowly, and we were twenty minutes getting to\nher lady friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  She enlivened the journey by describing to us, as we\ntrailed along, the various pains she had in her back.\n\nHer lady friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rooms were let.  From there we were recommended to No.\n27.  No. 27 was full, and sent us to No. 32, and 32 was full.\n\nThen we went back into the high road, and Harris sat down on the hamper\nand said he would go no further.  He said it seemed a quiet spot, and he\nwould like to die there.  He requested George and me to kiss his mother\nfor him, and to tell all his relations that he forgave them and died\nhappy.\n\nAt that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small boy (and I\ncannot think of any more effective disguise an angel could have assumed),\nwith a can of beer in one hand, and in the other something at the end of\na string, which he let down on to every flat stone he came across, and\nthen pulled up again, this producing a peculiarly unattractive sound,\nsuggestive of suffering.\n\nWe asked this heavenly messenger (as we discovered him afterwards to be)\nif he knew of any lonely house, whose occupants were few and feeble (old\nladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred), who could be easily frightened\ninto giving up their beds for the night to three desperate men; or, if\nnot this, could he recommend us to an empty pigstye, or a disused\nlimekiln, or anything of that sort.  He did not know of any such place\u00e2\u0080\u0094at\nleast, not one handy; but he said that, if we liked to come with him, his\nmother had a room to spare, and could put us up for the night.\n\nWe fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed him, and it\nwould have made a very beautiful picture if the boy himself had not been\nso over-powered by our emotion as to be unable to sustain himself under\nit, and sunk to the ground, letting us all down on top of him.  Harris\nwas so overcome with joy that he fainted, and had to seize the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbeer-can and half empty it before he could recover consciousness, and\nthen he started off at a run, and left George and me to bring on the\nluggage.\n\nIt was a little four-roomed cottage where the boy lived, and his\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0094good soul!\u00e2\u0080\u0094gave us hot bacon for supper, and we ate it all\u00e2\u0080\u0094five\npounds\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a jam tart afterwards, and two pots of tea, and then we went\nto bed.  There were two beds in the room; one was a 2ft. 6in. truckle\nbed, and George and I slept in that, and kept in by tying ourselves\ntogether with a sheet; and the other was the little boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed, and Harris\nhad that all to himself, and we found him, in the morning, with two feet\nof bare leg sticking out at the bottom, and George and I used it to hang\nthe towels on while we bathed.\n\nWe were not so uppish about what sort of hotel we would have, next time\nwe went to Datchet.\n\nTo return to our present trip: nothing exciting happened, and we tugged\nsteadily on to a little below Monkey Island, where we drew up and\nlunched.  We tackled the cold beef for lunch, and then we found that we\nhad forgotten to bring any mustard.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I ever in my life,\nbefore or since, felt I wanted mustard as badly as I felt I wanted it\nthen.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for mustard as a rule, and it is very seldom that I\ntake it at all, but I would have given worlds for it then.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how many worlds there may be in the universe, but anyone who\nhad brought me a spoonful of mustard at that precise moment could have\nhad them all.  I grow reckless like that when I want a thing and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nget it.\n\nHarris said he would have given worlds for mustard too.  It would have\nbeen a good thing for anybody who had come up to that spot with a can of\nmustard, then: he would have been set up in worlds for the rest of his\nlife.\n\nBut there!  I daresay both Harris and I would have tried to back out of\nthe bargain after we had got the mustard.  One makes these extravagant\noffers in moments of excitement, but, of course, when one comes to think\nof it, one sees how absurdly out of proportion they are with the value of\nthe required article.  I heard a man, going up a mountain in Switzerland,\nonce say he would give worlds for a glass of beer, and, when he came to a\nlittle shanty where they kept it, he kicked up a most fearful row because\nthey charged him five francs for a bottle of Bass.  He said it was a\nscandalous imposition, and he wrote to the _Times_ about it.\n\nIt cast a gloom over the boat, there being no mustard.  We ate our beef\nin silence.  Existence seemed hollow and uninteresting.  We thought of\nthe happy days of childhood, and sighed.  We brightened up a bit,\nhowever, over the apple-tart, and, when George drew out a tin of\npine-apple from the bottom of the hamper, and rolled it into the middle\nof the boat, we felt that life was worth living after all.\n\nWe are very fond of pine-apple, all three of us.  We looked at the\npicture on the tin; we thought of the juice.  We smiled at one another,\nand Harris got a spoon ready.\n\nThen we looked for the knife to open the tin with.  We turned out\neverything in the hamper.  We turned out the bags.  We pulled up the\nboards at the bottom of the boat.  We took everything out on to the bank\nand shook it.  There was no tin-opener to be found.\n\nThen Harris tried to open the tin with a pocket-knife, and broke the\nknife and cut himself badly; and George tried a pair of scissors, and the\nscissors flew up, and nearly put his eye out.  While they were dressing\ntheir wounds, I tried to make a hole in the thing with the spiky end of\nthe hitcher, and the hitcher slipped and jerked me out between the boat\nand the bank into two feet of muddy water, and the tin rolled over,\nuninjured, and broke a teacup.\n\nThen we all got mad.  We took that tin out on the bank, and Harris went\nup into a field and got a big sharp stone, and I went back into the boat\nand brought out the mast, and George held the tin and Harris held the\nsharp end of his stone against the top of it, and I took the mast and\npoised it high up in the air, and gathered up all my strength and brought\nit down.\n\nIt was George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s straw hat that saved his life that day.  He keeps that\nhat now (what is left of it), and, of a winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evening, when the pipes\nare lit and the boys are telling stretchers about the dangers they have\npassed through, George brings it down and shows it round, and the\nstirring tale is told anew, with fresh exaggerations every time.\n\nHarris got off with merely a flesh wound.\n\nAfter that, I took the tin off myself, and hammered at it with the mast\ntill I was worn out and sick at heart, whereupon Harris took it in hand.\n\n[Picture: Flattened tin] We beat it out flat; we beat it back square; we\nbattered it into every form known to geometry\u00e2\u0080\u0094but we could not make a\nhole in it.  Then George went at it, and knocked it into a shape, so\nstrange, so weird, so unearthly in its wild hideousness, that he got\nfrightened and threw away the mast.  Then we all three sat round it on\nthe grass and looked at it.\n\nThere was one great dent across the top that had the appearance of a\nmocking grin, and it drove us furious, so that Harris rushed at the\nthing, and caught it up, and flung it far into the middle of the river,\nand as it sank we hurled our curses at it, and we got into the boat and\nrowed away from the spot, and never paused till we reached Maidenhead.\n\nMaidenhead itself is too snobby to be pleasant.  It is the haunt of the\nriver swell and his overdressed female companion.  It is the town of\nshowy hotels, patronised chiefly by dudes and ballet girls.  It is the\nwitch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kitchen from which go forth those demons of the\nriver\u00e2\u0080\u0094steam-launches.  The _London Journal_ duke always has his \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle\nplace\u00e2\u0080\u009d at Maidenhead; and the heroine of the three-volume novel always\ndines there when she goes out on the spree with somebody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband.\n\n                          [Picture: River scene]\n\nWe went through Maidenhead quickly, and then eased up, and took leisurely\nthat grand reach beyond Boulter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Cookham locks.  Clieveden Woods\nstill wore their dainty dress of spring, and rose up, from the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nedge, in one long harmony of blended shades of fairy green.  In its\nunbroken loveliness this is, perhaps, the sweetest stretch of all the\nriver, and lingeringly we slowly drew our little boat away from its deep\npeace.\n\nWe pulled up in the backwater, just below Cookham, and had tea; and, when\nwe were through the lock, it was evening.  A stiffish breeze had sprung\nup\u00e2\u0080\u0094in our favour, for a wonder; for, as a rule on the river, the wind is\nalways dead against you whatever way you go.  It is against you in the\nmorning, when you start for a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trip, and you pull a long distance,\nthinking how easy it will be to come back with the sail.  Then, after\ntea, the wind veers round, and you have to pull hard in its teeth all the\nway home.\n\nWhen you forget to take the sail at all, then the wind is consistently in\nyour favour both ways.  But there! this world is only a probation, and\nman was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.\n\nThis evening, however, they had evidently made a mistake, and had put the\nwind round at our back instead of in our face.  We kept very quiet about\nit, and got the sail up quickly before they found it out, and then we\nspread ourselves about the boat in thoughtful attitudes, and the sail\nbellied out, and strained, and grumbled at the mast, and the boat flew.\n\nI steered.\n\nThere is no more thrilling sensation I know of than sailing.  It comes as\nnear to flying as man has got to yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094except in dreams.  The wings of the\nrushing wind seem to be bearing you onward, you know not where.  You are\nno longer the slow, plodding, puny thing of clay, creeping tortuously\nupon the ground; you are a part of Nature!  Your heart is throbbing\nagainst hers!  Her glorious arms are round you, raising you up against\nher heart!  Your spirit is at one with hers; your limbs grow light!  The\nvoices of the air are singing to you.  The earth seems far away and\nlittle; and the clouds, so close above your head, are brothers, and you\nstretch your arms to them.\n\nWe had the river to ourselves, except that, far in the distance, we could\nsee a fishing-punt, moored in mid-stream, on which three fishermen sat;\nand we skimmed over the water, and passed the wooded banks, and no one\nspoke.\n\nI was steering.\n\nAs we drew nearer, we could see that the three men fishing seemed old and\nsolemn-looking men.  They sat on three chairs in the punt, and watched\nintently their lines.  And the red sunset threw a mystic light upon the\nwaters, and tinged with fire the towering woods, and made a golden glory\nof the piled-up clouds.  It was an hour of deep enchantment, of ecstatic\nhope and longing.  The little sail stood out against the purple sky, the\ngloaming lay around us, wrapping the world in rainbow shadows; and,\nbehind us, crept the night.\n\nWe seemed like knights of some old legend, sailing across some mystic\nlake into the unknown realm of twilight, unto the great land of the\nsunset.\n\nWe did not go into the realm of twilight; we went slap into that punt,\nwhere those three old men were fishing.  We did not know what had\nhappened at first, because the sail shut out the view, but from the\nnature of the language that rose up upon the evening air, we gathered\nthat we had come into the neighbourhood of human beings, and that they\nwere vexed and discontented.\n\nHarris let the sail down, and then we saw what had happened.  We had\nknocked those three old gentlemen off their chairs into a general heap at\nthe bottom of the boat, and they were now slowly and painfully sorting\nthemselves out from each other, and picking fish off themselves; and as\nthey worked, they cursed us\u00e2\u0080\u0094not with a common cursory curse, but with\nlong, carefully-thought-out, comprehensive curses, that embraced the\nwhole of our career, and went away into the distant future, and included\nall our relations, and covered everything connected with us\u00e2\u0080\u0094good,\nsubstantial curses.\n\nHarris told them they ought to be grateful for a little excitement,\nsitting there fishing all day, and he also said that he was shocked and\ngrieved to hear men their age give way to temper so.\n\nBut it did not do any good.\n\nGeorge said he would steer, after that.  He said a mind like mine ought\nnot to be expected to give itself away in steering boats\u00e2\u0080\u0094better let a\nmere commonplace human being see after that boat, before we jolly well\nall got drowned; and he took the lines, and brought us up to Marlow.\n\nAnd at Marlow we left the boat by the bridge, and went and put up for the\nnight at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                           [Picture: The boat]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nMarlow.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bisham Abbey.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Medmenham Monks.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Montmorency thinks he will\nmurder an old Tom cat.\u00e2\u0080\u0094But eventually decides that he will let it\nlive.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Shameful conduct of a fox terrier at the Civil Service Stores.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our\ndeparture from Marlow.\u00e2\u0080\u0094An imposing procession.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The steam launch, useful\nreceipts for annoying and hindering it.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We decline to drink the river.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A\npeaceful dog.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Strange disappearance of Harris and a pie.\n\nMarlow is one of the pleasantest river centres I know of.  It is a\nbustling, lively little town; not very picturesque on the whole, it is\ntrue, but there are many quaint nooks and corners to be found in it,\nnevertheless\u00e2\u0080\u0094standing arches in the shattered bridge of Time, over which\nour fancy travels back to the days when Marlow Manor owned Saxon Algar\nfor its lord, ere conquering William seized it to give to Queen Matilda,\nere it passed to the Earls of Warwick or to worldly-wise Lord Paget, the\ncouncillor of four successive sovereigns.\n\nThere is lovely country round about it, too, if, after boating, you are\nfond of a walk, while the river itself is at its best here.  Down to\nCookham, past the Quarry Woods and the meadows, is a lovely reach.  Dear\nold Quarry Woods! with your narrow, climbing paths, and little winding\nglades, how scented to this hour you seem with memories of sunny summer\ndays!  How haunted are your shadowy vistas with the ghosts of laughing\nfaces! how from your whispering leaves there softly fall the voices of\nlong ago!\n\n[Picture: Bisham Abbey] From Marlow up to Sonning is even fairer yet.\nGrand old Bisham Abbey, whose stone walls have rung to the shouts of the\nKnights Templars, and which, at one time, was the home of Anne of Cleves\nand at another of Queen Elizabeth, is passed on the right bank just half\na mile above Marlow Bridge.  Bisham Abbey is rich in melodramatic\nproperties.  It contains a tapestry bed-chamber, and a secret room hid\nhigh up in the thick walls.  The ghost of the Lady Holy, who beat her\nlittle boy to death, still walks there at night, trying to wash its\nghostly hands clean in a ghostly basin.\n\nWarwick, the king-maker, rests there, careless now about such trivial\nthings as earthly kings and earthly kingdoms; and Salisbury, who did good\nservice at Poitiers.  Just before you come to the abbey, and right on the\nriver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bank, is Bisham Church, and, perhaps, if any tombs are worth\ninspecting, they are the tombs and monuments in Bisham Church.  It was\nwhile floating in his boat under the Bisham beeches that Shelley, who was\nthen living at Marlow (you can see his house now, in West street),\ncomposed _The Revolt of Islam_.\n\nBy Hurley Weir, a little higher up, I have often thought that I could\nstay a month without having sufficient time to drink in all the beauty of\nthe scene.  The village of Hurley, five minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 walk from the lock, is\nas old a little spot as there is on the river, dating, as it does, to\nquote the quaint phraseology of those dim days, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom the times of King\nSebert and King Offa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Just past the weir (going up) is Danes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Field,\nwhere the invading Danes once encamped, during their march to\nGloucestershire; and a little further still, nestling by a sweet corner\nof the stream, is what is left of Medmenham Abbey.\n\nThe famous Medmenham monks, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cHell Fire Club,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as they were commonly\ncalled, and of whom the notorious Wilkes was a member, were a fraternity\nwhose motto was \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo as you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that invitation still stands over\nthe ruined doorway of the abbey.  Many years before this bogus abbey,\nwith its congregation of irreverent jesters, was founded, there stood\nupon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind, whose monks were of a\nsomewhat different type to the revellers that were to follow them, five\nhundred years afterwards.\n\nThe Cistercian monks, whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth century,\nwore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls, and ate no flesh, nor fish,\nnor eggs.  They lay upon straw, and they rose at midnight to mass.  They\nspent the day in labour, reading, and prayer; and over all their lives\nthere fell a silence as of death, for no one spoke.\n\nA grim fraternity, passing grim lives in that sweet spot, that God had\nmade so bright!  Strange that Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voices all around them\u00e2\u0080\u0094the soft\nsinging of the waters, the whisperings of the river grass, the music of\nthe rushing wind\u00e2\u0080\u0094should not have taught them a truer meaning of life than\nthis.  They listened there, through the long days, in silence, waiting\nfor a voice from heaven; and all day long and through the solemn night it\nspoke to them in myriad tones, and they heard it not.\n\nFrom Medmenham to sweet Hambledon Lock the river is full of peaceful\nbeauty, but, after it passes Greenlands, the rather uninteresting looking\nriver residence of my newsagent\u00e2\u0080\u0094a quiet unassuming old gentleman, who may\noften be met with about these regions, during the summer months, sculling\nhimself along in easy vigorous style, or chatting genially to some old\nlock-keeper, as he passes through\u00e2\u0080\u0094until well the other side of Henley, it\nis somewhat bare and dull.\n\nWe got up tolerably early on the Monday morning at Marlow, and went for a\nbathe before breakfast; and, coming back, Montmorency made an awful ass\nof himself.  The only subject on which Montmorency and I have any serious\ndifference of opinion is cats.  I like cats; Montmorency does not.\n\n[Picture: Cat] When I meet a cat, I say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor Pussy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and stop down and\ntickle the side of its head; and the cat sticks up its tail in a rigid,\ncast-iron manner, arches its back, and wipes its nose up against my\ntrousers; and all is gentleness and peace.  When Montmorency meets a cat,\nthe whole street knows about it; and there is enough bad language wasted\nin ten seconds to last an ordinarily respectable man all his life, with\ncare.\n\nI do not blame the dog (contenting myself, as a rule, with merely\nclouting his head or throwing stones at him), because I take it that it\nis his nature.  Fox-terriers are born with about four times as much\noriginal sin in them as other dogs are, and it will take years and years\nof patient effort on the part of us Christians to bring about any\nappreciable reformation in the rowdiness of the fox-terrier nature.\n\nI remember being in the lobby of the Haymarket Stores one day, and all\nround about me were dogs, waiting for the return of their owners, who\nwere shopping inside.  There were a mastiff, and one or two collies, and\na St. Bernard, a few retrievers and Newfoundlands, a boar-hound, a French\npoodle, with plenty of hair round its head, but mangy about the middle; a\nbull-dog, a few Lowther Arcade sort of animals, about the size of rats,\nand a couple of Yorkshire tykes.\n\nThere they sat, patient, good, and thoughtful.  A solemn peacefulness\nseemed to reign in that lobby.  An air of calmness and resignation\u00e2\u0080\u0094of\ngentle sadness pervaded the room.\n\nThen a sweet young lady entered, leading a meek-looking little\nfox-terrier, and left him, chained up there, between the bull-dog and the\npoodle.  He sat and looked about him for a minute.  Then he cast up his\neyes to the ceiling, and seemed, judging from his expression, to be\nthinking of his mother.  Then he yawned.  Then he looked round at the\nother dogs, all silent, grave, and dignified.\n\nHe looked at the bull-dog, sleeping dreamlessly on his right.  He looked\nat the poodle, erect and haughty, on his left.  Then, without a word of\nwarning, without the shadow of a provocation, he bit that poodle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near\nfore-leg, and a yelp of agony rang through the quiet shades of that\nlobby.\n\nThe result of his first experiment seemed highly satisfactory to him, and\nhe determined to go on and make things lively all round.  He sprang over\nthe poodle and vigorously attacked a collie, and the collie woke up, and\nimmediately commenced a fierce and noisy contest with the poodle.  Then\nFoxey came back to his own place, and caught the bull-dog by the ear, and\ntried to throw him away; and the bull-dog, a curiously impartial animal,\nwent for everything he could reach, including the hall-porter, which gave\nthat dear little terrier the opportunity to enjoy an uninterrupted fight\nof his own with an equally willing Yorkshire tyke.\n\nAnyone who knows canine nature need hardly, be told that, by this time,\nall the other dogs in the place were fighting as if their hearths and\nhomes depended on the fray.  The big dogs fought each other\nindiscriminately; and the little dogs fought among themselves, and filled\nup their spare time by biting the legs of the big dogs.\n\nThe whole lobby was a perfect pandemonium, and the din was terrific.  A\ncrowd assembled outside in the Haymarket, and asked if it was a vestry\nmeeting; or, if not, who was being murdered, and why?  Men came with\npoles and ropes, and tried to separate the dogs, and the police were sent\nfor.\n\nAnd in the midst of the riot that sweet young lady returned, and snatched\nup that sweet little dog of hers (he had laid the tyke up for a month,\nand had on the expression, now, of a new-born lamb) into her arms, and\nkissed him, and asked him if he was killed, and what those great nasty\nbrutes of dogs had been doing to him; and he nestled up against her, and\ngazed up into her face with a look that seemed to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so glad\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to take me away from this disgraceful scene!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said that the people at the Stores had no right to allow great savage\nthings like those other dogs to be put with respectable people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dogs,\nand that she had a great mind to summon somebody.\n\nSuch is the nature of fox-terriers; and, therefore, I do not blame\nMontmorency for his tendency to row with cats; but he wished he had not\ngiven way to it that morning.\n\nWe were, as I have said, returning from a dip, and half-way up the High\nStreet a cat darted out from one of the houses in front of us, and began\nto trot across the road.  Montmorency gave a cry of joy\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cry of a\nstern warrior who sees his enemy given over to his hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sort of cry\nCromwell might have uttered when the Scots came down the hill\u00e2\u0080\u0094and flew\nafter his prey.\n\nHis victim was a large black Tom.  I never saw a larger cat, nor a more\ndisreputable-looking cat.  It had lost half its tail, one of its ears,\nand a fairly appreciable proportion of its nose.  It was a long,\nsinewy-looking animal.  It had a calm, contented air about it.\n\nMontmorency went for that poor cat at the rate of twenty miles an hour;\nbut the cat did not hurry up\u00e2\u0080\u0094did not seem to have grasped the idea that\nits life was in danger.  It trotted quietly on until its would-be\nassassin was within a yard of it, and then it turned round and sat down\nin the middle of the road, and looked at Montmorency with a gentle,\ninquiring expression, that said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!  You want me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMontmorency does not lack pluck; but there was something about the look\nof that cat that might have chilled the heart of the boldest dog.  He\nstopped abruptly, and looked back at Tom.\n\nNeither spoke; but the conversation that one could imagine was clearly as\nfollows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nTHE CAT: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I do anything for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMONTMORENCY: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, thanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTHE CAT: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you mind speaking, if you really want anything, you\nknow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMONTMORENCY (_backing down the High Street_): \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094not at\nall\u00e2\u0080\u0094certainly\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you trouble.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am afraid I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a mistake.  I\nthought I knew you.  Sorry I disturbed you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTHE CAT: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite a pleasure.  Sure you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anything,\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMONTMORENCY (_still backing_): \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all, thanks\u00e2\u0080\u0094not at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094very kind\nof you.  Good morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTHE CAT: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the cat rose, and continued his trot; and Montmorency, fitting what\nhe calls his tail carefully into its groove, came back to us, and took up\nan unimportant position in the rear.\n\nTo this day, if you say the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cCats!\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Montmorency, he will visibly\nshrink and look up piteously at you, as if to say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe did our marketing after breakfast, and revictualled the boat for three\ndays.  George said we ought to take vegetables\u00e2\u0080\u0094that it was unhealthy not\nto eat vegetables.  He said they were easy enough to cook, and that he\nwould see to that; so we got ten pounds of potatoes, a bushel of peas,\nand a few cabbages.  We got a beefsteak pie, a couple of gooseberry\ntarts, and a leg of mutton from the hotel; and fruit, and cakes, and\nbread and butter, and jam, and bacon and eggs, and other things we\nforaged round about the town for.\n\nOur departure from Marlow I regard as one of our greatest successes.  It\nwas dignified and impressive, without being ostentatious.  We had\ninsisted at all the shops we had been to that the things should be sent\nwith us then and there.  None of your \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir, I will send them off at\nonce: the boy will be down there before you are, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then fooling\nabout on the landing-stage, and going back to the shop twice to have a\nrow about them, for us.  We waited while the basket was packed, and took\nthe boy with us.\n\nWe went to a good many shops, adopting this principle at each one; and\nthe consequence was that, by the time we had finished, we had as fine a\ncollection of boys with baskets following us around as heart could\ndesire; and our final march down the middle of the High Street, to the\nriver, must have been as imposing a spectacle as Marlow had seen for many\na long day.\n\nThe order of the procession was as follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n                      Montmorency, carrying a stick.\n         Two disreputable-looking curs, friends of Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n        George, carrying coats and rugs, and smoking a short pipe.\n                 Harris, trying to walk with easy grace,\n          while carrying a bulged-out Gladstone bag in one hand\n                 and a bottle of lime-juice in the other.\n                    Greengrocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy and baker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy,\n                              with baskets.\n                  Boots from the hotel, carrying hamper.\n                     Confectioner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy, with basket.\n                        Grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy, with basket.\n                             Long-haired dog.\n                     Cheesemonger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy, with basket.\n                         Odd man carrying a bag.\n        Bosom companion of odd man, with his hands in his pockets,\n                          smoking a short clay.\n                      Fruiterer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy, with basket.\n             Myself, carrying three hats and a pair of boots,\n                and trying to look as if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it.\n                   Six small boys, and four stray dogs.\n\nWhen we got down to the landing-stage, the boatman said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me see, sir; was yours a steam-launch or a house-boat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: The bring of the provisions] On our informing him it was a\ndouble-sculling skiff, he seemed surprised.\n\nWe had a good deal of trouble with steam launches that morning.  It was\njust before the Henley week, and they were going up in large numbers;\nsome by themselves, some towing houseboats.  I do hate steam launches: I\nsuppose every rowing man does.  I never see a steam launch but I feel I\nshould like to lure it to a lonely part of the river, and there, in the\nsilence and the solitude, strangle it.\n\nThere is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the knack\nof rousing every evil instinct in my nature, and I yearn for the good old\ndays, when you could go about and tell people what you thought of them\nwith a hatchet and a bow and arrows.  The expression on the face of the\nman who, with his hands in his pockets, stands by the stern, smoking a\ncigar, is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself; and the\nlordly whistle for you to get out of the way would, I am confident,\nensure a verdict of \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustifiable homicide\u00e2\u0080\u009d from any jury of river men.\n\nThey used to _have_ to whistle for us to get out of their way.  If I may\ndo so, without appearing boastful, I think I can honestly say that our\none small boat, during that week, caused more annoyance and delay and\naggravation to the steam launches that we came across than all the other\ncraft on the river put together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteam launch, coming!\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of us would cry out, on sighting the enemy in\nthe distance; and, in an instant, everything was got ready to receive\nher.  I would take the lines, and Harris and George would sit down beside\nme, all of us with our backs to the launch, and the boat would drift out\nquietly into mid-stream.\n\nOn would come the launch, whistling, and on we would go, drifting.  At\nabout a hundred yards off, she would start whistling like mad, and the\npeople would come and lean over the side, and roar at us; but we never\nheard them!  Harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother, and\nGeorge and I would not have missed a word of it for worlds.\n\nThen that launch would give one final shriek of a whistle that would\nnearly burst the boiler, and she would reverse her engines, and blow off\nsteam, and swing round and get aground; everyone on board of it would\nrush to the bow and yell at us, and the people on the bank would stand\nand shout to us, and all the other passing boats would stop and join in,\ntill the whole river for miles up and down was in a state of frantic\ncommotion.  And then Harris would break off in the most interesting part\nof his narrative, and look up with mild surprise, and say to George:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, George, bless me, if here isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a steam launch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd George would answer:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, do you know, I _thought_ I heard something!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpon which we would get nervous and confused, and not know how to get the\nboat out of the way, and the people in the launch would crowd round and\ninstruct us:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPull your right\u00e2\u0080\u0094you, you idiot! back with your left.  No, not _you_\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nother one\u00e2\u0080\u0094leave the lines alone, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\u00e2\u0080\u0094now, both together.  NOT\n_that_ way.  Oh, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen they would lower a boat and come to our assistance; and, after\nquarter of an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effort, would get us clean out of their way, so that\nthey could go on; and we would thank them so much, and ask them to give\nus a tow.  But they never would.\n\nAnother good way we discovered of irritating the aristocratic type of\nsteam launch, was to mistake them for a beanfeast, and ask them if they\nwere Messrs. Cubit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars, and could they\nlend us a saucepan.\n\nOld ladies, not accustomed to the river, are always intensely nervous of\nsteam launches.  I remember going up once from Staines to Windsor\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nstretch of water peculiarly rich in these mechanical monstrosities\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a\nparty containing three ladies of this description.  It was very exciting.\nAt the first glimpse of every steam launch that came in view, they\ninsisted on landing and sitting down on the bank until it was out of\nsight again.  They said they were very sorry, but that they owed it to\ntheir families not to be fool-hardy.\n\nWe found ourselves short of water at Hambledon Lock; so we took our jar\nand went up to the lock-keeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house to beg for some.\n\nGeorge was our spokesman.  He put on a winning smile, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, please could you spare us a little water?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the old gentleman; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake as much as you want, and\nleave the rest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured George, looking about him.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0094where do\nyou keep it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always in the same place my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the stolid reply: \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust\nbehind you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, turning round.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, bless us, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your eyes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment, as he twisted\nGeorge round and pointed up and down the stream.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough of it\nto see, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed George, grasping the idea; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink the river,\nyou know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; but you can drink _some_ of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the old fellow.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\n_I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve_ drunk for the last fifteen years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGeorge told him that his appearance, after the course, did not seem a\nsufficiently good advertisement for the brand; and that he would prefer\nit out of a pump.\n\nWe got some from a cottage a little higher up.  I daresay _that_ was only\nriver water, if we had known.  But we did not know, so it was all right.\nWhat the eye does not see, the stomach does not get upset over.\n\nWe tried river water once, later on in the season, but it was not a\nsuccess.  We were coming down stream, and had pulled up to have tea in a\nbackwater near Windsor.  Our jar was empty, and it was a case of going\nwithout our tea or taking water from the river.  Harris was for chancing\nit.  He said it must be all right if we boiled the water.  He said that\nthe various germs of poison present in the water would be killed by the\nboiling.  So we filled our kettle with Thames backwater, and boiled it;\nand very careful we were to see that it did boil.\n\nWe had made the tea, and were just settling down comfortably to drink it,\nwhen George, with his cup half-way to his lips, paused and exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Harris and I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, looking westward.\n\n[Picture: The dog] Harris and I followed his gaze, and saw, coming down\ntowards us on the sluggish current, a dog.  It was one of the quietest\nand peacefullest dogs I have ever seen.  I never met a dog who seemed\nmore contented\u00e2\u0080\u0094more easy in its mind.  It was floating dreamily on its\nback, with its four legs stuck up straight into the air.  It was what I\nshould call a full-bodied dog, with a well-developed chest.  On he came,\nserene, dignified, and calm, until he was abreast of our boat, and there,\namong the rushes, he eased up, and settled down cosily for the evening.\n\nGeorge said he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want any tea, and emptied his cup into the water.\nHarris did not feel thirsty, either, and followed suit.  I had drunk half\nmine, but I wished I had not.\n\nI asked George if he thought I was likely to have typhoid.\n\nHe said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no;\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought I had a very good chance indeed of escaping\nit.  Anyhow, I should know in about a fortnight, whether I had or had\nnot.\n\nWe went up the backwater to Wargrave.  It is a short cut, leading out of\nthe right-hand bank about half a mile above Marsh Lock, and is well worth\ntaking, being a pretty, shady little piece of stream, besides saving\nnearly half a mile of distance.\n\nOf course, its entrance is studded with posts and chains, and surrounded\nwith notice boards, menacing all kinds of torture, imprisonment, and\ndeath to everyone who dares set scull upon its waters\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wonder some of\nthese riparian boors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t claim the air of the river and threaten\neveryone with forty shillings fine who breathes it\u00e2\u0080\u0094but the posts and\nchains a little skill will easily avoid; and as for the boards, you\nmight, if you have five minutes to spare, and there is nobody about, take\none or two of them down and throw them into the river.\n\nHalf-way up the backwater, we got out and lunched; and it was during this\nlunch that George and I received rather a trying shock.\n\nHarris received a shock, too; but I do not think Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shock could\nhave been anything like so bad as the shock that George and I had over\nthe business.\n\nYou see, it was in this way: we were sitting in a meadow, about ten yards\nfrom the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, and we had just settled down comfortably to feed.\nHarris had the beefsteak pie between his knees, and was carving it, and\nGeorge and I were waiting with our plates ready.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you got a spoon there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Harris; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want a spoon to help the\ngravy with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hamper was close behind us, and George and I both turned round to\nreach one out.  We were not five seconds getting it.  When we looked\nround again, Harris and the pie were gone!\n\nIt was a wide, open field.  There was not a tree or a bit of hedge for\nhundreds of yards.  He could not have tumbled into the river, because we\nwere on the water side of him, and he would have had to climb over us to\ndo it.\n\nGeorge and I gazed all about.  Then we gazed at each other.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas he been snatched up to heaven?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hardly have taken the pie too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George.\n\nThere seemed weight in this objection, and we discarded the heavenly\ntheory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose the truth of the matter is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested George, descending to\nthe commonplace and practicable, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat there has been an earthquake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he added, with a touch of sadness in his voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish he\nhadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been carving that pie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith a sigh, we turned our eyes once more towards the spot where Harris\nand the pie had last been seen on earth; and there, as our blood froze in\nour veins and our hair stood up on end, we saw Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head\u00e2\u0080\u0094and nothing\nbut his head\u00e2\u0080\u0094sticking bolt upright among the tall grass, the face very\nred, and bearing upon it an expression of great indignation!\n\nGeorge was the first to recover.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand tell us whether you are alive or dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094and where\nis the rest of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a stupid ass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you did it\non purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed George and I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, put me to sit here\u00e2\u0080\u0094darn silly trick!  Here, catch hold of the pie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n[Picture: Rescuing the pie] And out of the middle of the earth, as it\nseemed to us, rose the pie\u00e2\u0080\u0094very much mixed up and damaged; and, after it,\nscrambled Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0094tumbled, grubby, and wet.\n\nHe had been sitting, without knowing it, on the very verge of a small\ngully, the long grass hiding it from view; and in leaning a little back\nhe had shot over, pie and all.\n\nHe said he had never felt so surprised in all his life, as when he first\nfelt himself going, without being able to conjecture in the slightest\nwhat had happened.  He thought at first that the end of the world had\ncome.\n\nHarris believes to this day that George and I planned it all beforehand.\nThus does unjust suspicion follow even the most blameless for, as the\npoet says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho shall escape calumny?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWho, indeed!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n    Wargrave.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Waxworks.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sonning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our stew.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Montmorency is\n    sarcastic.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fight between Montmorency and the tea-kettle.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n    banjo studies.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Meet with discouragement.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Difficulties in the way of\n    the musical amateur.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Learning to play the bagpipes.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris feels sad\n    after supper.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and I go for a walk.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Return hungry and\n    wet.\u00e2\u0080\u0094There is a strangeness about Harris.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris and the swans, a\n    remarkable story.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Harris has a troubled night.\n\nWe caught a breeze, after lunch, which took us gently up past Wargrave\nand Shiplake.  Mellowed in the drowsy sunlight of a summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afternoon,\nWargrave, nestling where the river bends, makes a sweet old picture as\nyou pass it, and one that lingers long upon the retina of memory.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cGeorge and Dragon\u00e2\u0080\u009d at Wargrave boasts a sign, painted on the one\nside by Leslie, R.A., and on the other by Hodgson of that ilk.  Leslie\nhas depicted the fight; Hodgson has imagined the scene, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter the\nFight\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094George, the work done, enjoying his pint of beer.\n\nDay, the author of _Sandford and Merton_, lived and\u00e2\u0080\u0094more credit to the\nplace still\u00e2\u0080\u0094was killed at Wargrave.  In the church is a memorial to Mrs.\nSarah Hill, who bequeathed 1 pound annually, to be divided at Easter,\nbetween two boys and two girls who \u00e2\u0080\u009chave never been undutiful to their\nparents; who have never been known to swear or to tell untruths, to\nsteal, or to break windows.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Fancy giving up all that for five shillings\na year!  It is not worth it.\n\nIt is rumoured in the town that once, many years ago, a boy appeared who\nreally never had done these things\u00e2\u0080\u0094or at all events, which was all that\nwas required or could be expected, had never been known to do them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nthus won the crown of glory.  He was exhibited for three weeks afterwards\nin the Town Hall, under a glass case.\n\nWhat has become of the money since no one knows.  They say it is always\nhanded over to the nearest wax-works show.\n\nShiplake is a pretty village, but it cannot be seen from the river, being\nupon the hill.  Tennyson was married in Shiplake Church.\n\nThe river up to Sonning winds in and out through many islands, and is\nvery placid, hushed, and lonely.  Few folk, except at twilight, a pair or\ntwo of rustic lovers, walk along its banks.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Arry and Lord Fitznoodle\nhave been left behind at Henley, and dismal, dirty Reading is not yet\nreached.  It is a part of the river in which to dream of bygone days, and\nvanished forms and faces, and things that might have been, but are not,\nconfound them.\n\nWe got out at Sonning, and went for a walk round the village.  It is the\nmost fairy-like little nook on the whole river.  It is more like a stage\nvillage than one built of bricks and mortar.  Every house is smothered in\nroses, and now, in early June, they were bursting forth in clouds of\ndainty splendour.  If you stop at Sonning, put up at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBull,\u00e2\u0080\u009d behind\nthe church.  It is a veritable picture of an old country inn, with green,\nsquare courtyard in front, where, on seats beneath the trees, the old men\ngroup of an evening to drink their ale and gossip over village politics;\nwith low, quaint rooms and latticed windows, and awkward stairs and\nwinding passages.\n\nWe roamed about sweet Sonning for an hour or so, and then, it being too\nlate to push on past Reading, we decided to go back to one of the\nShiplake islands, and put up there for the night.  It was still early\nwhen we got settled, and George said that, as we had plenty of time, it\nwould be a splendid opportunity to try a good, slap-up supper.  He said\nhe would show us what could be done up the river in the way of cooking,\nand suggested that, with the vegetables and the remains of the cold beef\nand general odds and ends, we should make an Irish stew.\n\nIt seemed a fascinating idea.  George gathered wood and made a fire, and\nHarris and I started to peel the potatoes.  I should never have thought\nthat peeling potatoes was such an undertaking.  The job turned out to be\nthe biggest thing of its kind that I had ever been in.  We began\ncheerfully, one might almost say skittishly, but our light-heartedness\nwas gone by the time the first potato was finished.  The more we peeled,\nthe more peel there seemed to be left on; by the time we had got all the\npeel off and all the eyes out, there was no potato left\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least none\nworth speaking of.  George came and had a look at it\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was about the\nsize of a pea-nut.  He said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wasting them.  You must scrape them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo we scraped them, and that was harder work than peeling.  They are such\nan extraordinary shape, potatoes\u00e2\u0080\u0094all bumps and warts and hollows.  We\nworked steadily for five-and-twenty minutes, and did four potatoes.  Then\nwe struck.  We said we should require the rest of the evening for\nscraping ourselves.\n\nI never saw such a thing as potato-scraping for making a fellow in a\nmess.  It seemed difficult to believe that the potato-scrapings in which\nHarris and I stood, half smothered, could have come off four potatoes.\nIt shows you what can be done with economy and care.\n\nGeorge said it was absurd to have only four potatoes in an Irish stew, so\nwe washed half-a-dozen or so more, and put them in without peeling.  We\nalso put in a cabbage and about half a peck of peas.  George stirred it\nall up, and then he said that there seemed to be a lot of room to spare,\nso we overhauled both the hampers, and picked out all the odds and ends\nand the remnants, and added them to the stew.  There were half a pork pie\nand a bit of cold boiled bacon left, and we put them in.  Then George\nfound half a tin of potted salmon, and he emptied that into the pot.\n\nHe said that was the advantage of Irish stew: you got rid of such a lot\nof things.  I fished out a couple of eggs that had got cracked, and put\nthose in.  George said they would thicken the gravy.\n\nI forget the other ingredients, but I know nothing was wasted; and I\nremember that, towards the end, Montmorency, who had evinced great\ninterest in the proceedings throughout, strolled away with an earnest and\nthoughtful air, reappearing, a few minutes afterwards, with a dead\nwater-rat in his mouth, which he evidently wished to present as his\ncontribution to the dinner; whether in a sarcastic spirit, or with a\ngenuine desire to assist, I cannot say.\n\nWe had a discussion as to whether the rat should go in or not.  Harris\nsaid that he thought it would be all right, mixed up with the other\nthings, and that every little helped; but George stood up for precedent.\nHe said he had never heard of water-rats in Irish stew, and he would\nrather be on the safe side, and not try experiments.\n\nHarris said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you never try a new thing, how can you tell what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men\nsuch as you that hamper the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress.  Think of the man who first\ntried German sausage!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a great success, that Irish stew.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I ever enjoyed a\nmeal more.  There was something so fresh and piquant about it.  One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npalate gets so tired of the old hackneyed things: here was a dish with a\nnew flavour, with a taste like nothing else on earth.\n\nAnd it was nourishing, too.  As George said, there was good stuff in it.\nThe peas and potatoes might have been a bit softer, but we all had good\nteeth, so that did not matter much: and as for the gravy, it was a poem\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\nlittle too rich, perhaps, for a weak stomach, but nutritious.\n\nWe finished up with tea and cherry tart.  Montmorency had a fight with\nthe kettle during tea-time, and came off a poor second.\n\nThroughout the trip, he had manifested great curiosity concerning the\nkettle.  He would sit and watch it, as it boiled, with a puzzled\nexpression, and would try and rouse it every now and then by growling at\nit.  When it began to splutter and steam, he regarded it as a challenge,\nand would want to fight it, only, at that precise moment, some one would\nalways dash up and bear off his prey before he could get at it.\n\nTo-day he determined he would be beforehand.  At the first sound the\nkettle made, he rose, growling, and advanced towards it in a threatening\nattitude.  It was only a little kettle, but it was full of pluck, and it\nup and spit at him.\n\n[Picture: Montmorency and the kettle] \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! would ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d growled\nMontmorency, showing his teeth; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach ye to cheek a hard-working,\nrespectable dog; ye miserable, long-nosed, dirty-looking scoundrel, ye.\nCome on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he rushed at that poor little kettle, and seized it by the spout.\n\nThen, across the evening stillness, broke a blood-curdling yelp, and\nMontmorency left the boat, and did a constitutional three times round the\nisland at the rate of thirty-five miles an hour, stopping every now and\nthen to bury his nose in a bit of cool mud.\n\nFrom that day Montmorency regarded the kettle with a mixture of awe,\nsuspicion, and hate.  Whenever he saw it he would growl and back at a\nrapid rate, with his tail shut down, and the moment it was put upon the\nstove he would promptly climb out of the boat, and sit on the bank, till\nthe whole tea business was over.\n\nGeorge got out his banjo after supper, and wanted to play it, but Harris\nobjected: he said he had got a headache, and did not feel strong enough\nto stand it.  George thought the music might do him good\u00e2\u0080\u0094said music often\nsoothed the nerves and took away a headache; and he twanged two or three\nnotes, just to show Harris what it was like.\n\nHarris said he would rather have the headache.\n\nGeorge has never learned to play the banjo to this day.  He has had too\nmuch all-round discouragement to meet.  He tried on two or three\nevenings, while we were up the river, to get a little practice, but it\nwas never a success.  Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language used to be enough to unnerve any\nman; added to which, Montmorency would sit and howl steadily, right\nthrough the performance.  It was not giving the man a fair chance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he want to howl like that for when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m playing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d George would\nexclaim indignantly, while taking aim at him with a boot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want to play like that for when he is howling?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harris would\nretort, catching the boot.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou let him alone.  He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help howling.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a musical ear, and your playing _makes_ him howl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo George determined to postpone study of the banjo until he reached\nhome.  But he did not get much opportunity even there.  Mrs. P. used to\ncome up and say she was very sorry\u00e2\u0080\u0094for herself, she liked to hear him\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nthe lady upstairs was in a very delicate state, and the doctor was afraid\nit might injure the child.\n\nThen George tried taking it out with him late at night, and practising\nround the square.  But the inhabitants complained to the police about it,\nand a watch was set for him one night, and he was captured.  The evidence\nagainst him was very clear, and he was bound over to keep the peace for\nsix months.\n\nHe seemed to lose heart in the business after that.  He did make one or\ntwo feeble efforts to take up the work again when the six months had\nelapsed, but there was always the same coldness\u00e2\u0080\u0094the same want of sympathy\non the part of the world to fight against; and, after awhile, he\ndespaired altogether, and advertised the instrument for sale at a great\nsacrifice\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cowner having no further use for same\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094and took to learning\ncard tricks instead.\n\nIt must be disheartening work learning a musical instrument.  You would\nthink that Society, for its own sake, would do all it could to assist a\nman to acquire the art of playing a musical instrument.  But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\n\nI knew a young fellow once, who was studying to play the bagpipes, and\nyou would be surprised at the amount of opposition he had to contend\nwith.  Why, not even from the members of his own family did he receive\nwhat you could call active encouragement.  His father was dead against\nthe business from the beginning, and spoke quite unfeelingly on the\nsubject.\n\nMy friend used to get up early in the morning to practise, but he had to\ngive that plan up, because of his sister.  She was somewhat religiously\ninclined, and she said it seemed such an awful thing to begin the day\nlike that.\n\nSo he sat up at night instead, and played after the family had gone to\nbed, but that did not do, as it got the house such a bad name.  People,\ngoing home late, would stop outside to listen, and then put it about all\nover the town, the next morning, that a fearful murder had been committed\nat Mr. Jefferson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the night before; and would describe how they had\nheard the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shrieks and the brutal oaths and curses of the\nmurderer, followed by the prayer for mercy, and the last dying gurgle of\nthe corpse.\n\nSo they let him practise in the day-time, in the back-kitchen with all\nthe doors shut; but his more successful passages could generally be heard\nin the sitting-room, in spite of these precautions, and would affect his\nmother almost to tears.\n\nShe said it put her in mind of her poor father (he had been swallowed by\na shark, poor man, while bathing off the coast of New Guinea\u00e2\u0080\u0094where the\nconnection came in, she could not explain).\n\nThen they knocked up a little place for him at the bottom of the garden,\nabout quarter of a mile from the house, and made him take the machine\ndown there when he wanted to work it; and sometimes a visitor would come\nto the house who knew nothing of the matter, and they would forget to\ntell him all about it, and caution him, and he would go out for a stroll\nround the garden and suddenly get within earshot of those bagpipes,\nwithout being prepared for it, or knowing what it was.  If he were a man\nof strong mind, it only gave him fits; but a person of mere average\nintellect it usually sent mad.\n\nThere is, it must be confessed, something very sad about the early\nefforts of an amateur in bagpipes.  I have felt that myself when\nlistening to my young friend.  They appear to be a trying instrument to\nperform upon.  You have to get enough breath for the whole tune before\nyou start\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least, so I gathered from watching Jefferson.\n\nHe would begin magnificently with a wild, full, come-to-the-battle sort\nof a note, that quite roused you.  But he would get more and more piano\nas he went on, and the last verse generally collapsed in the middle with\na splutter and a hiss.\n\nYou want to be in good health to play the bagpipes.\n\nYoung Jefferson only learnt to play one tune on those bagpipes; but I\nnever heard any complaints about the insufficiency of his repertoire\u00e2\u0080\u0094none\nwhatever.  This tune was \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Campbells are Coming, Hooray\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hooray!\u00e2\u0080\u009d so he\nsaid, though his father always held that it was \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Blue Bells of\nScotland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Nobody seemed quite sure what it was exactly, but they all\nagreed that it sounded Scotch.\n\nStrangers were allowed three guesses, and most of them guessed a\ndifferent tune each time.\n\nHarris was disagreeable after supper,\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think it must have been the stew\nthat had upset him: he is not used to high living,\u00e2\u0080\u0094so George and I left\nhim in the boat, and settled to go for a mouch round Henley.  He said he\nshould have a glass of whisky and a pipe, and fix things up for the\nnight.  We were to shout when we returned, and he would row over from the\nisland and fetch us.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to sleep, old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we said as we started.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot much fear of that while this stew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grunted, as he pulled\nback to the island.\n\nHenley was getting ready for the regatta, and was full of bustle.  We met\na goodish number of men we knew about the town, and in their pleasant\ncompany the time slipped by somewhat quickly; so that it was nearly\neleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock before we set off on our four-mile walk home\u00e2\u0080\u0094as we had\nlearned to call our little craft by this time.\n\nIt was a dismal night, coldish, with a thin rain falling; and as we\ntrudged through the dark, silent fields, talking low to each other, and\nwondering if we were going right or not, we thought of the cosy boat,\nwith the bright light streaming through the tight-drawn canvas; of Harris\nand Montmorency, and the whisky, and wished that we were there.\n\nWe conjured up the picture of ourselves inside, tired and a little\nhungry; of the gloomy river and the shapeless trees; and, like a giant\nglow-worm underneath them, our dear old boat, so snug and warm and\ncheerful.  We could see ourselves at supper there, pecking away at cold\nmeat, and passing each other chunks of bread; we could hear the cheery\nclatter of our knives, the laughing voices, filling all the space, and\noverflowing through the opening out into the night.  And we hurried on to\nrealise the vision.\n\nWe struck the tow-path at length, and that made us happy; because prior\nto this we had not been sure whether we were walking towards the river or\naway from it, and when you are tired and want to go to bed uncertainties\nlike that worry you.  We passed Skiplake as the clock was striking the\nquarter to twelve; and then George said, thoughtfully:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen to remember which of the islands it was, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I replied, beginning to grow thoughtful too, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  How many\nare there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly four,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered George.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be all right, if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I queried; but we dismissed that train of thought.\n\nWe shouted when we came opposite the first island, but there was no\nresponse; so we went to the second, and tried there, and obtained the\nsame result.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!  I remember now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was the third one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd we ran on hopefully to the third one, and hallooed.\n\nNo answer!\n\nThe case was becoming serious. it was now past midnight.  The hotels at\nSkiplake and Henley would be crammed; and we could not go round, knocking\nup cottagers and householders in the middle of the night, to know if they\nlet apartments!  George suggested walking back to Henley and assaulting a\npoliceman, and so getting a night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lodging in the station-house.  But\nthen there was the thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose he only hits us back and refuses to\nlock us up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe could not pass the whole night fighting policemen.  Besides, we did\nnot want to overdo the thing and get six months.\n\nWe despairingly tried what seemed in the darkness to be the fourth\nisland, but met with no better success.  The rain was coming down fast\nnow, and evidently meant to last.  We were wet to the skin, and cold and\nmiserable.  We began to wonder whether there were only four islands or\nmore, or whether we were near the islands at all, or whether we were\nanywhere within a mile of where we ought to be, or in the wrong part of\nthe river altogether; everything looked so strange and different in the\ndarkness.  We began to understand the sufferings of the Babes in the\nWood.\n\nJust when we had given up all hope\u00e2\u0080\u0094yes, I know that is always the time\nthat things do happen in novels and tales; but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it.  I\nresolved, when I began to write this book, that I would be strictly\ntruthful in all things; and so I will be, even if I have to employ\nhackneyed phrases for the purpose.\n\nIt _was_ just when we had given up all hope, and I must therefore say so.\nJust when we had given up all hope, then, I suddenly caught sight, a\nlittle way below us, of a strange, weird sort of glimmer flickering among\nthe trees on the opposite bank.  For an instant I thought of ghosts: it\nwas such a shadowy, mysterious light.  The next moment it flashed across\nme that it was our boat, and I sent up such a yell across the water that\nmade the night seem to shake in its bed.\n\nWe waited breathless for a minute, and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh! divinest music of the\ndarkness!\u00e2\u0080\u0094we heard the answering bark of Montmorency.  We shouted back\nloud enough to wake the Seven Sleepers\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never could understand myself\nwhy it should take more noise to wake seven sleepers than one\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, after\nwhat seemed an hour, but what was really, I suppose, about five minutes,\nwe saw the lighted boat creeping slowly over the blackness, and heard\nHarris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleepy voice asking where we were.\n\nThere was an unaccountable strangeness about Harris.  It was something\nmore than mere ordinary tiredness.  He pulled the boat against a part of\nthe bank from which it was quite impossible for us to get into it, and\nimmediately went to sleep.  It took us an immense amount of screaming and\nroaring to wake him up again and put some sense into him; but we\nsucceeded at last, and got safely on board.\n\nHarris had a sad expression on him, so we noticed, when we got into the\nboat.  He gave you the idea of a man who had been through trouble.  We\nasked him if anything had happened, and he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n[Picture: Swans] \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed we had moored close to a swan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest, and, soon after George\nand I had gone, the female swan came back, and kicked up a row about it.\nHarris had chivied her off, and she had gone away, and fetched up her old\nman.  Harris said he had had quite a fight with these two swans; but\ncourage and skill had prevailed in the end, and he had defeated them.\n\nHalf-an-hour afterwards they returned with eighteen other swans!  It must\nhave been a fearful battle, so far as we could understand Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\naccount of it.  The swans had tried to drag him and Montmorency out of\nthe boat and drown them; and he had defended himself like a hero for four\nhours, and had killed the lot, and they had all paddled away to die.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many swans did you say there were?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThirty-two,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Harris, sleepily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said eighteen just now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d grunted Harris; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said twelve.  Think I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat were the real facts about these swans we never found out.  We\nquestioned Harris on the subject in the morning, and he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\nswans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and seemed to think that George and I had been dreaming.\n\nOh, how delightful it was to be safe in the boat, after our trials and\nfears!  We ate a hearty supper, George and I, and we should have had some\ntoddy after it, if we could have found the whisky, but we could not.  We\nexamined Harris as to what he had done with it; but he did not seem to\nknow what we meant by \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhisky,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or what we were talking about at all.\nMontmorency looked as if he knew something, but said nothing.\n\nI slept well that night, and should have slept better if it had not been\nfor Harris.  I have a vague recollection of having been woke up at least\na dozen times during the night by Harris wandering about the boat with\nthe lantern, looking for his clothes.  He seemed to be worrying about his\nclothes all night.\n\nTwice he routed up George and myself to see if we were lying on his\ntrousers.  George got quite wild the second time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the thunder do you want your trousers for, in the middle of the\nnight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked indignantly.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you lie down, and go to sleep?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI found him in trouble, the next time I awoke, because he could not find\nhis socks; and my last hazy remembrance is of being rolled over on my\nside, and of hearing Harris muttering something about its being an\nextraordinary thing where his umbrella could have got to.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nHousehold duties.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Love of work.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The old river hand, what he does and what\nhe tells you he has done.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Scepticism of the new generation.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Early boating\nrecollections.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rafting.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George does the thing in style.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The old boatman,\nhis method.\u00e2\u0080\u0094So calm, so full of peace.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The beginner.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Punting.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A sad\naccident.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pleasures of friendship.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sailing, my first experience.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Possible\nreason why we were not drowned.\n\n[Picture: Woman at housework] We woke late the next morning, and, at\nHarris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnest desire, partook of a plain breakfast, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon\ndainties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Then we cleaned up, and put everything straight (a continual\nlabour, which was beginning to afford me a pretty clear insight into a\nquestion that had often posed me\u00e2\u0080\u0094namely, how a woman with the work of\nonly one house on her hands manages to pass away her time), and, at about\nten, set out on what we had determined should be a good day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey.\n\nWe agreed that we would pull this morning, as a change from towing; and\nHarris thought the best arrangement would be that George and I should\nscull, and he steer.  I did not chime in with this idea at all; I said I\nthought Harris would have been showing a more proper spirit if he had\nsuggested that he and George should work, and let me rest a bit.  It\nseemed to me that I was doing more than my fair share of the work on this\ntrip, and I was beginning to feel strongly on the subject.\n\nIt always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do.  It\nis not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it fascinates\nme.  I can sit and look at it for hours.  I love to keep it by me: the\nidea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.\n\nYou cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a\npassion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly an\ninch of room for any more.  I shall have to throw out a wing soon.\n\nAnd I am careful of my work, too.  Why, some of the work that I have by\nme now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\nfinger-mark on it.  I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now\nand then and dust it.  No man keeps his work in a better state of\npreservation than I do.\n\nBut, though I crave for work, I still like to be fair.  I do not ask for\nmore than my proper share.\n\nBut I get it without asking for it\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least, so it appears to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this\nworries me.\n\nGeorge says he does not think I need trouble myself on the subject.  He\nthinks it is only my over-scrupulous nature that makes me fear I am\nhaving more than my due; and that, as a matter of fact, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have half\nas much as I ought.  But I expect he only says this to comfort me.\n\nIn a boat, I have always noticed that it is the fixed idea of each member\nof the crew that he is doing everything.  Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notion was, that it\nwas he alone who had been working, and that both George and I had been\nimposing upon him.  George, on the other hand, ridiculed the idea of\nHarris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s having done anything more than eat and sleep, and had a\ncast-iron opinion that it was he\u00e2\u0080\u0094George himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094who had done all the\nlabour worth speaking of.\n\nHe said he had never been out with such a couple of lazily skulks as\nHarris and I.\n\nThat amused Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy old George talking about work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, about\nhalf-an-hour of it would kill him.  Have you ever seen George work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, turning to me.\n\nI agreed with Harris that I never had\u00e2\u0080\u0094most certainly not since we had\nstarted on this trip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how _you_ can know much about it, one way or the\nother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d George retorted on Harris; \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m blest if you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been\nasleep half the time.  Have you ever seen Harris fully awake, except at\nmeal-time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked George, addressing me.\n\nTruth compelled me to support George.  Harris had been very little good\nin the boat, so far as helping was concerned, from the beginning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, hang it all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done more than old J., anyhow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d rejoined Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very well have done less,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added George.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose J. thinks he is the passenger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Harris.\n\nAnd that was their gratitude to me for having brought them and their\nwretched old boat all the way up from Kingston, and for having\nsuperintended and managed everything for them, and taken care of them,\nand slaved for them.  It is the way of the world.\n\nWe settled the present difficulty by arranging that Harris and George\nshould scull up past Reading, and that I should tow the boat on from\nthere.  Pulling a heavy boat against a strong stream has few attractions\nfor me now.  There was a time, long ago, when I used to clamour for the\nhard work: now I like to give the youngsters a chance.\n\nI notice that most of the old river hands are similarly retiring,\nwhenever there is any stiff pulling to be done.  You can always tell the\nold river hand by the way in which he stretches himself out upon the\ncushions at the bottom of the boat, and encourages the rowers by telling\nthem anecdotes about the marvellous feats he performed last season.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCall what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing hard work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he drawls, between his contented\nwhiffs, addressing the two perspiring novices, who have been grinding\naway steadily up stream for the last hour and a half; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy, Jim Biffles\nand Jack and I, last season, pulled up from Marlow to Goring in one\nafternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0094never stopped once.  Do you remember that, Jack?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJack, who has made himself a bed up in the prow of all the rugs and coats\nhe can collect, and who has been lying there asleep for the last two\nhours, partially wakes up on being thus appealed to, and recollects all\nabout the matter, and also remembers that there was an unusually strong\nstream against them all the way\u00e2\u0080\u0094likewise a stiff wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout thirty-four miles, I suppose, it must have been,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adds the first\nspeaker, reaching down another cushion to put under his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u0094no; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exaggerate, Tom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmurs Jack, reprovingly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthirty-three\nat the outside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Jack and Tom, quite exhausted by this conversational effort, drop off\nto sleep once more.  And the two simple-minded youngsters at the sculls\nfeel quite proud of being allowed to row such wonderful oarsmen as Jack\nand Tom, and strain away harder than ever.\n\nWhen I was a young man, I used to listen to these tales from my elders,\nand take them in, and swallow them, and digest every word of them, and\nthen come up for more; but the new generation do not seem to have the\nsimple faith of the old times.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0094George, Harris, and myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094took a \u00e2\u0080\u009craw\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099un\u00e2\u0080\u009d up with us once last season, and we plied him with the customary\nstretchers about the wonderful things we had done all the way up.\n\nWe gave him all the regular ones\u00e2\u0080\u0094the time-honoured lies that have done\nduty up the river with every boating-man for years past\u00e2\u0080\u0094and added seven\nentirely original ones that we had invented for ourselves, including a\nreally quite likely story, founded, to a certain extent, on an all but\ntrue episode, which had actually happened in a modified degree some years\nago to friends of ours\u00e2\u0080\u0094a story that a mere child could have believed\nwithout injuring itself, much.\n\nAnd that young man mocked at them all, and wanted us to repeat the feats\nthen and there, and to bet us ten to one that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nWe got to chatting about our rowing experiences this morning, and to\nrecounting stories of our first efforts in the art of oarsmanship.  My\nown earliest boating recollection is of five of us contributing\nthreepence each and taking out a curiously constructed craft on the\nRegent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park lake, drying ourselves subsequently, in the park-keeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlodge.\n\nAfter that, having acquired a taste for the water, I did a good deal of\nrafting in various suburban brickfields\u00e2\u0080\u0094an exercise providing more\ninterest and excitement than might be imagined, especially when you are\nin the middle of the pond and the proprietor of the materials of which\nthe raft is constructed suddenly appears on the bank, with a big stick in\nhis hand.\n\nYour first sensation on seeing this gentleman is that, somehow or other,\nyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel equal to company and conversation, and that, if you could\ndo so without appearing rude, you would rather avoid meeting him; and\nyour object is, therefore, to get off on the opposite side of the pond to\nwhich he is, and to go home quietly and quickly, pretending not to see\nhim.  He, on the contrary is yearning to take you by the hand, and talk\nto you.\n\nIt appears that he knows your father, and is intimately acquainted with\nyourself, but this does not draw you towards him.  He says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach\nyou to take his boards and make a raft of them; but, seeing that you know\nhow to do this pretty well already, the offer, though doubtless kindly\nmeant, seems a superfluous one on his part, and you are reluctant to put\nhim to any trouble by accepting it.\n\nHis anxiety to meet you, however, is proof against all your coolness, and\nthe energetic manner in which he dodges up and down the pond so as to be\non the spot to greet you when you land is really quite flattering.\n\nIf he be of a stout and short-winded build, you can easily avoid his\nadvances; but, when he is of the youthful and long-legged type, a meeting\nis inevitable.  The interview is, however, extremely brief, most of the\nconversation being on his part, your remarks being mostly of an\nexclamatory and mono-syllabic order, and as soon as you can tear yourself\naway you do so.\n\nI devoted some three months to rafting, and, being then as proficient as\nthere was any need to be at that branch of the art, I determined to go in\nfor rowing proper, and joined one of the Lea boating clubs.\n\nBeing out in a boat on the river Lea, especially on Saturday afternoons,\nsoon makes you smart at handling a craft, and spry at escaping being run\ndown by roughs or swamped by barges; and it also affords plenty of\nopportunity for acquiring the most prompt and graceful method of lying\ndown flat at the bottom of the boat so as to avoid being chucked out into\nthe river by passing tow-lines.\n\nBut it does not give you style.  It was not till I came to the Thames\nthat I got style.  My style of rowing is very much admired now.  People\nsay it is so quaint.\n\nGeorge never went near the water until he was sixteen.  Then he and eight\nother gentlemen of about the same age went down in a body to Kew one\nSaturday, with the idea of hiring a boat there, and pulling to Richmond\nand back; one of their number, a shock-headed youth, named Joskins, who\nhad once or twice taken out a boat on the Serpentine, told them it was\njolly fun, boating!\n\nThe tide was running out pretty rapidly when they reached the\nlanding-stage, and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the river, but\nthis did not trouble them at all, and they proceeded to select their\nboat.\n\nThere was an eight-oared racing outrigger drawn up on the stage; that was\nthe one that took their fancy.  They said they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have that one, please.\nThe boatman was away, and only his boy was in charge.  The boy tried to\ndamp their ardour for the outrigger, and showed them two or three very\ncomfortable-looking boats of the family-party build, but those would not\ndo at all; the outrigger was the boat they thought they would look best\nin.\n\nSo the boy launched it, and they took off their coats and prepared to\ntake their seats.  The boy suggested that George, who, even in those\ndays, was always the heavy man of any party, should be number four.\nGeorge said he should be happy to be number four, and promptly stepped\ninto bow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place, and sat down with his back to the stern.  They got him\ninto his proper position at last, and then the others followed.\n\nA particularly nervous boy was appointed cox, and the steering principle\nexplained to him by Joskins.  Joskins himself took stroke.  He told the\nothers that it was simple enough; all they had to do was to follow him.\n\nThey said they were ready, and the boy on the landing stage took a\nboat-hook and shoved him off.\n\nWhat then followed George is unable to describe in detail.  He has a\nconfused recollection of having, immediately on starting, received a\nviolent blow in the small of the back from the butt-end of number five\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nscull, at the same time that his own seat seemed to disappear from under\nhim by magic, and leave him sitting on the boards.  He also noticed, as a\ncurious circumstance, that number two was at the same instant lying on\nhis back at the bottom of the boat, with his legs in the air, apparently\nin a fit.\n\nThey passed under Kew Bridge, broadside, at the rate of eight miles an\nhour. Joskins being the only one who was rowing.  George, on recovering\nhis seat, tried to help him, but, on dipping his oar into the water, it\nimmediately, to his intense surprise, disappeared under the boat, and\nnearly took him with it.\n\nAnd then \u00e2\u0080\u009ccox\u00e2\u0080\u009d threw both rudder lines over-board, and burst into tears.\n\nHow they got back George never knew, but it took them just forty minutes.\nA dense crowd watched the entertainment from Kew Bridge with much\ninterest, and everybody shouted out to them different directions.  Three\ntimes they managed to get the boat back through the arch, and three times\nthey were carried under it again, and every time \u00e2\u0080\u009ccox\u00e2\u0080\u009d looked up and saw\nthe bridge above him he broke out into renewed sobs.\n\nGeorge said he little thought that afternoon that he should ever come to\nreally like boating.\n\nHarris is more accustomed to sea rowing than to river work, and says\nthat, as an exercise, he prefers it.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  I remember taking a small\nboat out at Eastbourne last summer: I used to do a good deal of sea\nrowing years ago, and I thought I should be all right; but I found I had\nforgotten the art entirely.  When one scull was deep down underneath the\nwater, the other would be flourishing wildly about in the air.  To get a\ngrip of the water with both at the same time I had to stand up.  The\nparade was crowded with nobility and gentry, and I had to pull past them\nin this ridiculous fashion.  I landed half-way down the beach, and\nsecured the services of an old boatman to take me back.\n\nI like to watch an old boatman rowing, especially one who has been hired\nby the hour.  There is something so beautifully calm and restful about\nhis method.  It is so free from that fretful haste, that vehement\nstriving, that is every day becoming more and more the bane of\nnineteenth-century life.  He is not for ever straining himself to pass\nall the other boats.  If another boat overtakes him and passes him it\ndoes not annoy him; as a matter of fact, they all do overtake him and\npass him\u00e2\u0080\u0094all those that are going his way.  This would trouble and\nirritate some people; the sublime equanimity of the hired boatman under\nthe ordeal affords us a beautiful lesson against ambition and uppishness.\n\nPlain practical rowing of the get-the-boat-along order is not a very\ndifficult art to acquire, but it takes a good deal of practice before a\nman feels comfortable, when rowing past girls.  It is the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime\u00e2\u0080\u009d that\nworries a youngster.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jolly funny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, as for the twentieth\ntime within five minutes he disentangles his sculls from yours; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\nget on all right when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m by myself!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo see two novices try to keep time with one another is very amusing.\nBow finds it impossible to keep pace with stroke, because stroke rows in\nsuch an extraordinary fashion.  Stroke is intensely indignant at this,\nand explains that what he has been endeavouring to do for the last ten\nminutes is to adapt his method to bow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s limited capacity.  Bow, in turn,\nthen becomes insulted, and requests stroke not to trouble his head about\nhim (bow), but to devote his mind to setting a sensible stroke.\n\n                     [Picture: Two novices in a boat]\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOr, shall _I_ take stroke?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he adds, with the evident idea that that\nwould at once put the whole matter right.\n\nThey splash along for another hundred yards with still moderate success,\nand then the whole secret of their trouble bursts upon stroke like a\nflash of inspiration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you what it is: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got my sculls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cries, turning to bow;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cpass yours over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, do you know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wondering how it was I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get on with\nthese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answers bow, quite brightening up, and most willingly assisting\nin the exchange.  \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Now_ we shall be all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut they are not\u00e2\u0080\u0094not even then.  Stroke has to stretch his arms nearly\nout of their sockets to reach his sculls now; while bow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pair, at each\nrecovery, hit him a violent blow in the chest.  So they change back\nagain, and come to the conclusion that the man has given them the wrong\nset altogether; and over their mutual abuse of this man they become quite\nfriendly and sympathetic.\n\nGeorge said he had often longed to take to punting for a change.  Punting\nis not as easy as it looks.  As in rowing, you soon learn how to get\nalong and handle the craft, but it takes long practice before you can do\nthis with dignity and without getting the water all up your sleeve.\n\nOne young man I knew had a very sad accident happen to him the first time\nhe went punting.  He had been getting on so well that he had grown quite\ncheeky over the business, and was walking up and down the punt, working\nhis pole with a careless grace that was quite fascinating to watch.  Up\nhe would march to the head of the punt, plant his pole, and then run\nalong right to the other end, just like an old punter.  Oh! it was grand.\n\n[Picture: Man and pole] And it would all have gone on being grand if he\nhad not unfortunately, while looking round to enjoy the scenery, taken\njust one step more than there was any necessity for, and walked off the\npunt altogether.  The pole was firmly fixed in the mud, and he was left\nclinging to it while the punt drifted away.  It was an undignified\nposition for him.  A rude boy on the bank immediately yelled out to a\nlagging chum to \u00e2\u0080\u009churry up and see a real monkey on a stick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could not go to his assistance, because, as ill-luck would have it, we\nhad not taken the proper precaution to bring out a spare pole with us.  I\ncould only sit and look at him.  His expression as the pole slowly sank\nwith him I shall never forget; there was so much thought in it.\n\nI watched him gently let down into the water, and saw him scramble out,\nsad and wet.  I could not help laughing, he looked such a ridiculous\nfigure.  I continued to chuckle to myself about it for some time, and\nthen it was suddenly forced in upon me that really I had got very little\nto laugh at when I came to think of it.  Here was I, alone in a punt,\nwithout a pole, drifting helplessly down mid-stream\u00e2\u0080\u0094possibly towards a\nweir.\n\nI began to feel very indignant with my friend for having stepped\noverboard and gone off in that way.  He might, at all events, have left\nme the pole.\n\nI drifted on for about a quarter of a mile, and then I came in sight of a\nfishing-punt moored in mid-stream, in which sat two old fishermen.  They\nsaw me bearing down upon them, and they called out to me to keep out of\ntheir way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I shouted back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they answered.\n\nI explained the matter to them when I got nearer, and they caught me and\nlent me a pole.  The weir was just fifty yards below.  I am glad they\nhappened to be there.\n\nThe first time I went punting was in company with three other fellows;\nthey were going to show me how to do it.  We could not all start\ntogether, so I said I would go down first and get out the punt, and then\nI could potter about and practice a bit until they came.\n\nI could not get a punt out that afternoon, they were all engaged; so I\nhad nothing else to do but to sit down on the bank, watching the river,\nand waiting for my friends.\n\nI had not been sitting there long before my attention became attracted to\na man in a punt who, I noticed with some surprise, wore a jacket and cap\nexactly like mine.  He was evidently a novice at punting, and his\nperformance was most interesting.  You never knew what was going to\nhappen when he put the pole in; he evidently did not know himself.\nSometimes he shot up stream and sometimes he shot down stream, and at\nother times he simply spun round and came up the other side of the pole.\nAnd with every result he seemed equally surprised and annoyed.\n\nThe people about the river began to get quite absorbed in him after a\nwhile, and to make bets with one another as to what would be the outcome\nof his next push.\n\nIn the course of time my friends arrived on the opposite bank, and they\nstopped and watched him too.  His back was towards them, and they only\nsaw his jacket and cap.  From this they immediately jumped to the\nconclusion that it was I, their beloved companion, who was making an\nexhibition of himself, and their delight knew no bounds.  They commenced\nto chaff him unmercifully.\n\nI did not grasp their mistake at first, and I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow rude of them\nto go on like that, with a perfect stranger, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  But before I could\ncall out and reprove them, the explanation of the matter occurred to me,\nand I withdrew behind a tree.\n\nOh, how they enjoyed themselves, ridiculing that young man!  For five\ngood minutes they stood there, shouting ribaldry at him, deriding him,\nmocking him, jeering at him.  They peppered him with stale jokes, they\neven made a few new ones and threw at him.  They hurled at him all the\nprivate family jokes belonging to our set, and which must have been\nperfectly unintelligible to him.  And then, unable to stand their brutal\njibes any longer, he turned round on them, and they saw his face!\n\nI was glad to notice that they had sufficient decency left in them to\nlook very foolish.  They explained to him that they had thought he was\nsome one they knew.  They said they hoped he would not deem them capable\nof so insulting any one except a personal friend of their own.\n\n[Picture: Bathing] Of course their having mistaken him for a friend\nexcused it.  I remember Harris telling me once of a bathing experience he\nhad at Boulogne.  He was swimming about there near the beach, when he\nfelt himself suddenly seized by the neck from behind, and forcibly\nplunged under water.  He struggled violently, but whoever had got hold of\nhim seemed to be a perfect Hercules in strength, and all his efforts to\nescape were unavailing.  He had given up kicking, and was trying to turn\nhis thoughts upon solemn things, when his captor released him.\n\nHe regained his feet, and looked round for his would-be murderer.  The\nassassin was standing close by him, laughing heartily, but the moment he\ncaught sight of Harris\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, as it emerged from the water, he started\nback and seemed quite concerned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI really beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered confusedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I took you for\na friend of mine!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHarris thought it was lucky for him the man had not mistaken him for a\nrelation, or he would probably have been drowned outright.\n\nSailing is a thing that wants knowledge and practice too\u00e2\u0080\u0094though, as a\nboy, I did not think so.  I had an idea it came natural to a body, like\nrounders and touch.  I knew another boy who held this view likewise, and\nso, one windy day, we thought we would try the sport.  We were stopping\ndown at Yarmouth, and we decided we would go for a trip up the Yare.  We\nhired a sailing boat at the yard by the bridge, and started off.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rather a rough day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the man to us, as we put off: \u00e2\u0080\u009cbetter\ntake in a reef and luff sharp when you get round the bend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe said we would make a point of it, and left him with a cheery\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d wondering to ourselves how you \u00e2\u0080\u009cluffed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and where we\nwere to get a \u00e2\u0080\u009creef\u00e2\u0080\u009d from, and what we were to do with it when we had got\nit.\n\nWe rowed until we were out of sight of the town, and then, with a wide\nstretch of water in front of us, and the wind blowing a perfect hurricane\nacross it, we felt that the time had come to commence operations.\n\nHector\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think that was his name\u00e2\u0080\u0094went on pulling while I unrolled the\nsail.  It seemed a complicated job, but I accomplished it at length, and\nthen came the question, which was the top end?\n\nBy a sort of natural instinct, we, of course, eventually decided that the\nbottom was the top, and set to work to fix it upside-down.  But it was a\nlong time before we could get it up, either that way or any other way.\nThe impression on the mind of the sail seemed to be that we were playing\nat funerals, and that I was the corpse and itself was the winding-sheet.\n\nWhen it found that this was not the idea, it hit me over the head with\nthe boom, and refused to do anything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWet it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hector; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrop it over and get it wet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said people in ships always wetted the sails before they put them up.\nSo I wetted it; but that only made matters worse than they were before.\nA dry sail clinging to your legs and wrapping itself round your head is\nnot pleasant, but, when the sail is sopping wet, it becomes quite vexing.\n\nWe did get the thing up at last, the two of us together.  We fixed it,\nnot exactly upside down\u00e2\u0080\u0094more sideways like\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we tied it up to the mast\nwith the painter, which we cut off for the purpose.\n\nThat the boat did not upset I simply state as a fact.  Why it did not\nupset I am unable to offer any reason.  I have often thought about the\nmatter since, but I have never succeeded in arriving at any satisfactory\nexplanation of the phenomenon.\n\nPossibly the result may have been brought about by the natural obstinacy\nof all things in this world.  The boat may possibly have come to the\nconclusion, judging from a cursory view of our behaviour, that we had\ncome out for a morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suicide, and had thereupon determined to\ndisappoint us.  That is the only suggestion I can offer.\n\nBy clinging like grim death to the gunwale, we just managed to keep\ninside the boat, but it was exhausting work.  Hector said that pirates\nand other seafaring people generally lashed the rudder to something or\nother, and hauled in the main top-jib, during severe squalls, and thought\nwe ought to try to do something of the kind; but I was for letting her\nhave her head to the wind.\n\nAs my advice was by far the easiest to follow, we ended by adopting it,\nand contrived to embrace the gunwale and give her her head.\n\nThe boat travelled up stream for about a mile at a pace I have never\nsailed at since, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to again.  Then, at a bend, she heeled\nover till half her sail was under water.  Then she righted herself by a\nmiracle and flew for a long low bank of soft mud.\n\nThat mud-bank saved us.  The boat ploughed its way into the middle of it\nand then stuck.  Finding that we were once more able to move according to\nour ideas, instead of being pitched and thrown about like peas in a\nbladder, we crept forward, and cut down the sail.\n\nWe had had enough sailing.  We did not want to overdo the thing and get a\nsurfeit of it.  We had had a sail\u00e2\u0080\u0094a good all-round exciting, interesting\nsail\u00e2\u0080\u0094and now we thought we would have a row, just for a change like.\n\nWe took the sculls and tried to push the boat off the mud, and, in doing\nso, we broke one of the sculls.  After that we proceeded with great\ncaution, but they were a wretched old pair, and the second one cracked\nalmost easier than the first, and left us helpless.\n\nThe mud stretched out for about a hundred yards in front of us, and\nbehind us was the water.  The only thing to be done was to sit and wait\nuntil someone came by.\n\nIt was not the sort of day to attract people out on the river, and it was\nthree hours before a soul came in sight.  It was an old fisherman who,\nwith immense difficulty, at last rescued us, and we were towed back in an\nignominious fashion to the boat-yard.\n\nWhat between tipping the man who had brought us home, and paying for the\nbroken sculls, and for having been out four hours and a half, it cost us\na pretty considerable number of weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pocket-money, that sail.  But we\nlearned experience, and they say that is always cheap at any price.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nReading.\u00e2\u0080\u0094We are towed by steam launch.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Irritating behaviour of small\nboats.\u00e2\u0080\u0094How they get in the way of steam launches.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and Harris again\nshirk their work.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Rather a hackneyed story.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Streatley and Goring.\n\nWe came in sight of Reading about eleven.  The river is dirty and dismal\nhere.  One does not linger in the neighbourhood of Reading.  The town\nitself is a famous old place, dating from the dim days of King Ethelred,\nwhen the Danes anchored their warships in the Kennet, and started from\nReading to ravage all the land of Wessex; and here Ethelred and his\nbrother Alfred fought and defeated them, Ethelred doing the praying and\nAlfred the fighting.\n\nIn later years, Reading seems to have been regarded as a handy place to\nrun down to, when matters were becoming unpleasant in London.  Parliament\ngenerally rushed off to Reading whenever there was a plague on at\nWestminster; and, in 1625, the Law followed suit, and all the courts were\nheld at Reading.  It must have been worth while having a mere ordinary\nplague now and then in London to get rid of both the lawyers and the\nParliament.\n\nDuring the Parliamentary struggle, Reading was besieged by the Earl of\nEssex, and, a quarter of a century later, the Prince of Orange routed\nKing James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troops there.\n\nHenry I. lies buried at Reading, in the Benedictine abbey founded by him\nthere, the ruins of which may still be seen; and, in this same abbey,\ngreat John of Gaunt was married to the Lady Blanche.\n\nAt Reading lock we came up with a steam launch, belonging to some friends\nof mine, and they towed us up to within about a mile of Streatley.  It is\nvery delightful being towed up by a launch.  I prefer it myself to\nrowing.  The run would have been more delightful still, if it had not\nbeen for a lot of wretched small boats that were continually getting in\nthe way of our launch, and, to avoid running down which, we had to be\ncontinually easing and stopping.  It is really most annoying, the manner\nin which these rowing boats get in the way of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch up the river;\nsomething ought to done to stop it.\n\nAnd they are so confoundedly impertinent, too, over it.  You can whistle\ntill you nearly burst your boiler before they will trouble themselves to\nhurry.  I would have one or two of them run down now and then, if I had\nmy way, just to teach them all a lesson.\n\nThe river becomes very lovely from a little above Reading.  The railway\nrather spoils it near Tilehurst, but from Mapledurham up to Streatley it\nis glorious.  A little above Mapledurham lock you pass Hardwick House,\nwhere Charles I. played bowls.  The neighbourhood of Pangbourne, where\nthe quaint little Swan Inn stands, must be as familiar to the _habitues_\nof the Art Exhibitions as it is to its own inhabitants.\n\nMy friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 launch cast us loose just below the grotto, and then Harris\nwanted to make out that it was my turn to pull.  This seemed to me most\nunreasonable.  It had been arranged in the morning that I should bring\nthe boat up to three miles above Reading.  Well, here we were, ten miles\nabove Reading!  Surely it was now their turn again.\n\nI could not get either George or Harris to see the matter in its proper\nlight, however; so, to save argument, I took the sculls.  I had not been\npulling for more than a minute or so, when George noticed something black\nfloating on the water, and we drew up to it.  George leant over, as we\nneared it, and laid hold of it.  And then he drew back with a cry, and a\nblanched face.\n\nIt was the dead body of a woman.  It lay very lightly on the water, and\nthe face was sweet and calm.  It was not a beautiful face; it was too\nprematurely aged-looking, too thin and drawn, to be that; but it was a\ngentle, lovable face, in spite of its stamp of pinch and poverty, and\nupon it was that look of restful peace that comes to the faces of the\nsick sometimes when at last the pain has left them.\n\nFortunately for us\u00e2\u0080\u0094we having no desire to be kept hanging about coroners\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ncourts\u00e2\u0080\u0094some men on the bank had seen the body too, and now took charge of\nit from us.\n\nWe found out the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story afterwards.  Of course it was the old, old\nvulgar tragedy.  She had loved and been deceived\u00e2\u0080\u0094or had deceived herself.\nAnyhow, she had sinned\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of us do now and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094and her family and\nfriends, naturally shocked and indignant, had closed their doors against\nher.\n\nLeft to fight the world alone, with the millstone of her shame around her\nneck, she had sunk ever lower and lower.  For a while she had kept both\nherself and the child on the twelve shillings a week that twelve hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndrudgery a day procured her, paying six shillings out of it for the\nchild, and keeping her own body and soul together on the remainder.\n\nSix shillings a week does not keep body and soul together very unitedly.\nThey want to get away from each other when there is only such a very\nslight bond as that between them; and one day, I suppose, the pain and\nthe dull monotony of it all had stood before her eyes plainer than usual,\nand the mocking spectre had frightened her.  She had made one last appeal\nto friends, but, against the chill wall of their respectability, the\nvoice of the erring outcast fell unheeded; and then she had gone to see\nher child\u00e2\u0080\u0094had held it in her arms and kissed it, in a weary, dull sort of\nway, and without betraying any particular emotion of any kind, and had\nleft it, after putting into its hand a penny box of chocolate she had\nbought it, and afterwards, with her last few shillings, had taken a\nticket and come down to Goring.\n\n                      [Picture: Woman in the water]\n\nIt seemed that the bitterest thoughts of her life must have centred about\nthe wooded reaches and the bright green meadows around Goring; but women\nstrangely hug the knife that stabs them, and, perhaps, amidst the gall,\nthere may have mingled also sunny memories of sweetest hours, spent upon\nthose shadowed deeps over which the great trees bend their branches down\nso low.\n\nShe had wandered about the woods by the river\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brink all day, and then,\nwhen evening fell and the grey twilight spread its dusky robe upon the\nwaters, she stretched her arms out to the silent river that had known her\nsorrow and her joy.  And the old river had taken her into its gentle\narms, and had laid her weary head upon its bosom, and had hushed away the\npain.\n\nThus had she sinned in all things\u00e2\u0080\u0094sinned in living and in dying.  God\nhelp her! and all other sinners, if any more there be.\n\nGoring on the left bank and Streatley on the right are both or either\ncharming places to stay at for a few days.  The reaches down to\nPangbourne woo one for a sunny sail or for a moonlight row, and the\ncountry round about is full of beauty.  We had intended to push on to\nWallingford that day, but the sweet smiling face of the river here lured\nus to linger for a while; and so we left our boat at the bridge, and went\nup into Streatley, and lunched at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBull,\u00e2\u0080\u009d much to Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsatisfaction.\n\nThey say that the hills on each ride of the stream here once joined and\nformed a barrier across what is now the Thames, and that then the river\nended there above Goring in one vast lake.  I am not in a position either\nto contradict or affirm this statement.  I simply offer it.\n\nIt is an ancient place, Streatley, dating back, like most river-side\ntowns and villages, to British and Saxon times.  Goring is not nearly so\npretty a little spot to stop at as Streatley, if you have your choice;\nbut it is passing fair enough in its way, and is nearer the railway in\ncase you want to slip off without paying your hotel bill.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nWashing day.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Fish and fishers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094On the art of angling.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A conscientious\nfly-fisher.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A fishy story.\n\n[Picture: Washing line] We stayed two days at Streatley, and got our\nclothes washed.  We had tried washing them ourselves, in the river, under\nGeorge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superintendence, and it had been a failure.  Indeed, it had been\nmore than a failure, because we were worse off after we had washed our\nclothes than we were before.  Before we had washed them, they had been\nvery, very dirty, it is true; but they were just wearable.  _After_ we\nhad washed them\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, the river between Reading and Henley was much\ncleaner, after we had washed our clothes in it, than it was before.  All\nthe dirt contained in the river between Reading and Henley, we collected,\nduring that wash, and worked it into our clothes.\n\nThe washerwoman at Streatley said she felt she owed it to herself to\ncharge us just three times the usual prices for that wash.  She said it\nhad not been like washing, it had been more in the nature of excavating.\n\nWe paid the bill without a murmur.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Streatley and Goring is a great fishing centre.\nThere is some excellent fishing to be had here.  The river abounds in\npike, roach, dace, gudgeon, and eels, just here; and you can sit and fish\nfor them all day.\n\nSome people do.  They never catch them.  I never knew anybody catch\nanything, up the Thames, except minnows and dead cats, but that has\nnothing to do, of course, with fishing!  The local fisherman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guide\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a word about catching anything.  All it says is the place is\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ca good station for fishing;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and, from what I have seen of the district,\nI am quite prepared to bear out this statement.\n\nThere is no spot in the world where you can get more fishing, or where\nyou can fish for a longer period.  Some fishermen come here and fish for\na day, and others stop and fish for a month.  You can hang on and fish\nfor a year, if you want to: it will be all the same.\n\nThe _Angler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide to the Thames_ says that \u00e2\u0080\u009cjack and perch are also to\nbe had about here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but there the _Angler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide_ is wrong.  Jack and\nperch may _be_ about there.  Indeed, I know for a fact that they are.\nYou can _see_ them there in shoals, when you are out for a walk along the\nbanks: they come and stand half out of the water with their mouths open\nfor biscuits.  And, if you go for a bathe, they crowd round, and get in\nyour way, and irritate you.  But they are not to be \u00e2\u0080\u009chad\u00e2\u0080\u009d by a bit of\nworm on the end of a hook, nor anything like it\u00e2\u0080\u0094not they!\n\nI am not a good fisherman myself.  I devoted a considerable amount of\nattention to the subject at one time, and was getting on, as I thought,\nfairly well; but the old hands told me that I should never be any real\ngood at it, and advised me to give it up.  They said that I was an\nextremely neat thrower, and that I seemed to have plenty of gumption for\nthe thing, and quite enough constitutional laziness.  But they were sure\nI should never make anything of a fisherman.  I had not got sufficient\nimagination.\n\nThey said that as a poet, or a shilling shocker, or a reporter, or\nanything of that kind, I might be satisfactory, but that, to gain any\nposition as a Thames angler, would require more play of fancy, more power\nof invention than I appeared to possess.\n\nSome people are under the impression that all that is required to make a\ngood fisherman is the ability to tell lies easily and without blushing;\nbut this is a mistake.  Mere bald fabrication is useless; the veriest\ntyro can manage that.  It is in the circumstantial detail, the\nembellishing touches of probability, the general air of scrupulous\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost\nof pedantic\u00e2\u0080\u0094veracity, that the experienced angler is seen.\n\nAnybody can come in and say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I caught fifteen dozen perch yesterday\nevening;\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast Monday I landed a gudgeon, weighing eighteen pounds,\nand measuring three feet from the tip to the tail.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere is no art, no skill, required for that sort of thing.  It shows\npluck, but that is all.\n\nNo; your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie, that way.  His\nmethod is a study in itself.\n\nHe comes in quietly with his hat on, appropriates the most comfortable\nchair, lights his pipe, and commences to puff in silence.  He lets the\nyoungsters brag away for a while, and then, during a momentary lull, he\nremoves the pipe from his mouth, and remarks, as he knocks the ashes out\nagainst the bars:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I had a haul on Tuesday evening that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much good my telling\nanybody about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! why\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they ask.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anybody would believe me if I did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replies the\nold fellow calmly, and without even a tinge of bitterness in his tone, as\nhe refills his pipe, and requests the landlord to bring him three of\nScotch, cold.\n\nThere is a pause after this, nobody feeling sufficiently sure of himself\nto contradict the old gentleman.  So he has to go on by himself without\nany encouragement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continues thoughtfully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it myself if\nanybody told it to me, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact, for all that.  I had been sitting\nthere all the afternoon and had caught literally nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0094except a few\ndozen dace and a score of jack; and I was just about giving it up as a\nbad job when I suddenly felt a rather smart pull at the line.  I thought\nit was another little one, and I went to jerk it up.  Hang me, if I could\nmove the rod!  It took me half-an-hour\u00e2\u0080\u0094half-an-hour, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u0094to land that\nfish; and every moment I thought the line was going to snap!  I reached\nhim at last, and what do you think it was?  A sturgeon! a forty pound\nsturgeon! taken on a line, sir!  Yes, you may well look surprised\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave another three of Scotch, landlord, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he goes on to tell of the astonishment of everybody who saw it;\nand what his wife said, when he got home, and of what Joe Buggles thought\nabout it.\n\nI asked the landlord of an inn up the river once, if it did not injure\nhim, sometimes, listening to the tales that the fishermen about there\ntold him; and he said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no; not now, sir.  It did used to knock me over a bit at first, but,\nlor love you! me and the missus we listens to \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all day now.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to, you know.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI knew a young man once, he was a most conscientious fellow, and, when he\ntook to fly-fishing, he determined never to exaggerate his hauls by more\nthan twenty-five per cent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I have caught forty fish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen I will tell people that I\nhave caught fifty, and so on.  But I will not lie any more than that,\nbecause it is sinful to lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the twenty-five per cent. plan did not work well at all.  He never\nwas able to use it.  The greatest number of fish he ever caught in one\nday was three, and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add twenty-five per cent. to three\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least,\nnot in fish.\n\nSo he increased his percentage to thirty-three-and-a-third; but that,\nagain, was awkward, when he had only caught one or two; so, to simplify\nmatters, he made up his mind to just double the quantity.\n\nHe stuck to this arrangement for a couple of months, and then he grew\ndissatisfied with it.  Nobody believed him when he told them that he only\ndoubled, and he, therefore, gained no credit that way whatever, while his\nmoderation put him at a disadvantage among the other anglers.  When he\nhad really caught three small fish, and said he had caught six, it used\nto make him quite jealous to hear a man, whom he knew for a fact had only\ncaught one, going about telling people he had landed two dozen.\n\nSo, eventually, he made one final arrangement with himself, which he has\nreligiously held to ever since, and that was to count each fish that he\ncaught as ten, and to assume ten to begin with.  For example, if he did\nnot catch any fish at all, then he said he had caught ten fish\u00e2\u0080\u0094you could\nnever catch less than ten fish by his system; that was the foundation of\nit.  Then, if by any chance he really did catch one fish, he called it\ntwenty, while two fish would count thirty, three forty, and so on.\n\nIt is a simple and easily worked plan, and there has been some talk\nlately of its being made use of by the angling fraternity in general.\nIndeed, the Committee of the Thames Angler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Association did recommend\nits adoption about two years ago, but some of the older members opposed\nit.  They said they would consider the idea if the number were doubled,\nand each fish counted as twenty.\n\nIf ever you have an evening to spare, up the river, I should advise you\nto drop into one of the little village inns, and take a seat in the\ntap-room.  You will be nearly sure to meet one or two old rod-men,\nsipping their toddy there, and they will tell you enough fishy stories,\nin half an hour, to give you indigestion for a month.\n\nGeorge and I\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what had become of Harris; he had gone out and\nhad a shave, early in the afternoon, and had then come back and spent\nfull forty minutes in pipeclaying his shoes, we had not seen him\nsince\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and I, therefore, and the dog, left to ourselves, went for a\nwalk to Wallingford on the second evening, and, coming home, we called in\nat a little river-side inn, for a rest, and other things.\n\nWe went into the parlour and sat down.  There was an old fellow there,\nsmoking a long clay pipe, and we naturally began chatting.\n\nHe told us that it had been a fine day to-day, and we told him that it\nhad been a fine day yesterday, and then we all told each other that we\nthought it would be a fine day to-morrow; and George said the crops\nseemed to be coming up nicely.\n\nAfter that it came out, somehow or other, that we were strangers in the\nneighbourhood, and that we were going away the next morning.\n\n[Picture: The trout] Then a pause ensued in the conversation, during\nwhich our eyes wandered round the room.  They finally rested upon a dusty\nold glass-case, fixed very high up above the chimney-piece, and\ncontaining a trout.  It rather fascinated me, that trout; it was such a\nmonstrous fish.  In fact, at first glance, I thought it was a cod.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the old gentleman, following the direction of my gaze, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfine\nfellow that, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite uncommon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I murmured; and George asked the old man how much he\nthought it weighed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEighteen pounds six ounces,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our friend, rising and taking down his\ncoat.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit wur sixteen year ago, come the third o\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nnext month, that I landed him.  I caught him just below the bridge with a\nminnow.  They told me he wur in the river, and I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have him, and\nso I did.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see many fish that size about here now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nthinking.  Good-night, gentlemen, good-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd out he went, and left us alone.\n\nWe could not take our eyes off the fish after that.  It really was a\nremarkably fine fish.  We were still looking at it, when the local\ncarrier, who had just stopped at the inn, came to the door of the room\nwith a pot of beer in his hand, and he also looked at the fish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-sized trout, that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, turning round to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you may well say that, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the man; and then, after a pull\nat his beer, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe you wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here, sir, when that fish was\ncaught?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we told him.  We were strangers in the neighbourhood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the carrier, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen, of course, how should you?  It was nearly\nfive years ago that I caught that trout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! was it you who caught it, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said I.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the genial old fellow.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI caught him just below the\nlock\u00e2\u0080\u0094leastways, what was the lock then\u00e2\u0080\u0094one Friday afternoon; and the\nremarkable thing about it is that I caught him with a fly.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gone out\npike fishing, bless you, never thinking of a trout, and when I saw that\nwhopper on the end of my line, blest if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite take me aback.\nWell, you see, he weighed twenty-six pound.  Good-night, gentlemen,\ngood-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFive minutes afterwards, a third man came in, and described how _he_ had\ncaught it early one morning, with bleak; and then he left, and a stolid,\nsolemn-looking, middle-aged individual came in, and sat down over by the\nwindow.\n\nNone of us spoke for a while; but, at length, George turned to the new\ncomer, and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive the liberty that we\u00e2\u0080\u0094perfect\nstrangers in the neighbourhood\u00e2\u0080\u0094are taking, but my friend here and myself\nwould be so much obliged if you would tell us how you caught that trout\nup there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, who told you I caught that trout!\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the surprised query.\n\nWe said that nobody had told us so, but somehow or other we felt\ninstinctively that it was he who had done it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a most remarkable thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094most remarkable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the stolid\nstranger, laughing; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause, as a matter of fact, you are quite right.\nI did catch it.  But fancy your guessing it like that.  Dear me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreally a most remarkable thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he went on, and told us how it had taken him half an hour to\nland it, and how it had broken his rod.  He said he had weighed it\ncarefully when he reached home, and it had turned the scale at\nthirty-four pounds.\n\nHe went in his turn, and when he was gone, the landlord came in to us.\nWe told him the various histories we had heard about his trout, and he\nwas immensely amused, and we all laughed very heartily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFancy Jim Bates and Joe Muggles and Mr. Jones and old Billy Maunders all\ntelling you that they had caught it.  Ha! ha! ha!  Well, that is good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid the honest old fellow, laughing heartily.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, they are the sort\nto give it _me_, to put up in _my_ parlour, if _they_ had caught it, they\nare!  Ha! ha! ha!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then he told us the real history of the fish.  It seemed that he had\ncaught it himself, years ago, when he was quite a lad; not by any art or\nskill, but by that unaccountable luck that appears to always wait upon a\nboy when he plays the wag from school, and goes out fishing on a sunny\nafternoon, with a bit of string tied on to the end of a tree.\n\nHe said that bringing home that trout had saved him from a whacking, and\nthat even his school-master had said it was worth the rule-of-three and\npractice put together.\n\nHe was called out of the room at this point, and George and I again\nturned our gaze upon the fish.\n\nIt really was a most astonishing trout.  The more we looked at it, the\nmore we marvelled at it.\n\nIt excited George so much that he climbed up on the back of a chair to\nget a better view of it.\n\nAnd then the chair slipped, and George clutched wildly at the trout-case\nto save himself, and down it came with a crash, George and the chair on\ntop of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t injured the fish, have you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I cried in alarm, rushing up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said George, rising cautiously and looking about.\n\nBut he had.  That trout lay shattered into a thousand fragments\u00e2\u0080\u0094I say a\nthousand, but they may have only been nine hundred.  I did not count\nthem.\n\nWe thought it strange and unaccountable that a stuffed trout should break\nup into little pieces like that.\n\nAnd so it would have been strange and unaccountable, if it had been a\nstuffed trout, but it was not.\n\nThat trout was plaster-of-Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nLocks.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George and I are\nphotographed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Wallingford.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dorchester.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Abingdon.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A family man.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A good\nspot for drowning.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A difficult bit of water.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Demoralizing effect of river\nair.\n\nWe left Streatley early the next morning, and pulled up to Culham, and\nslept under the canvas, in the backwater there.\n\nThe river is not extraordinarily interesting between Streatley and\nWallingford.  From Cleve you get a stretch of six and a half miles\nwithout a lock.  I believe this is the longest uninterrupted stretch\nanywhere above Teddington, and the Oxford Club make use of it for their\ntrial eights.\n\nBut however satisfactory this absence of locks may be to rowing-men, it\nis to be regretted by the mere pleasure-seeker.\n\nFor myself, I am fond of locks.  They pleasantly break the monotony of\nthe pull.  I like sitting in the boat and slowly rising out of the cool\ndepths up into new reaches and fresh views; or sinking down, as it were,\nout of the world, and then waiting, while the gloomy gates creak, and the\nnarrow strip of day-light between them widens till the fair smiling river\nlies full before you, and you push your little boat out from its brief\nprison on to the welcoming waters once again.\n\nThey are picturesque little spots, these locks.  The stout old\nlock-keeper, or his cheerful-looking wife, or bright-eyed daughter, are\npleasant folk to have a passing chat with. {287}  You meet other boats\nthere, and river gossip is exchanged.  The Thames would not be the\nfairyland it is without its flower-decked locks.\n\nTalking of locks reminds me of an accident George and I very nearly had\none summer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morning at Hampton Court.\n\nIt was a glorious day, and the lock was crowded; and, as is a common\npractice up the river, a speculative photographer was taking a picture of\nus all as we lay upon the rising waters.\n\nI did not catch what was going on at first, and was, therefore, extremely\nsurprised at noticing George hurriedly smooth out his trousers, ruffle up\nhis hair, and stick his cap on in a rakish manner at the back of his\nhead, and then, assuming an expression of mingled affability and sadness,\nsit down in a graceful attitude, and try to hide his feet.\n\nMy first idea was that he had suddenly caught sight of some girl he knew,\nand I looked about to see who it was.  Everybody in the lock seemed to\nhave been suddenly struck wooden.  They were all standing or sitting\nabout in the most quaint and curious attitudes I have ever seen off a\nJapanese fan.  All the girls were smiling.  Oh, they did look so sweet!\nAnd all the fellows were frowning, and looking stern and noble.\n\nAnd then, at last, the truth flashed across me, and I wondered if I\nshould be in time.  Ours was the first boat, and it would be unkind of me\nto spoil the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture, I thought.\n\nSo I faced round quickly, and took up a position in the prow, where I\nleant with careless grace upon the hitcher, in an attitude suggestive of\nagility and strength.  I arranged my hair with a curl over the forehead,\nand threw an air of tender wistfulness into my expression, mingled with a\ntouch of cynicism, which I am told suits me.\n\nAs we stood, waiting for the eventful moment, I heard someone behind call\nout:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHi! look at your nose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI could not turn round to see what was the matter, and whose nose it was\nthat was to be looked at.  I stole a side-glance at George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose!  It\nwas all right\u00e2\u0080\u0094at all events, there was nothing wrong with it that could\nbe altered.  I squinted down at my own, and that seemed all that could be\nexpected also.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at your nose, you stupid ass!\u00e2\u0080\u009d came the same voice again, louder.\n\nAnd then another voice cried:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPush your nose out, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you two with the dog!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNeither George nor I dared to turn round.  The man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand was on the cap,\nand the picture might be taken any moment.  Was it us they were calling\nto?  What was the matter with our noses?  Why were they to be pushed out!\n\nBut now the whole lock started yelling, and a stentorian voice from the\nback shouted:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at your boat, sir; you in the red and black caps.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your two\ncorpses that will get taken in that photo, if you ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWe looked then, and saw that the nose of our boat had got fixed under the\nwoodwork of the lock, while the in-coming water was rising all around it,\nand tilting it up.  In another moment we should be over.  Quick as\nthought, we each seized an oar, and a vigorous blow against the side of\nthe lock with the butt-ends released the boat, and sent us sprawling on\nour backs.\n\n[Picture: The photograph] We did not come out well in that photograph,\nGeorge and I.  Of course, as was to be expected, our luck ordained it,\nthat the man should set his wretched machine in motion at the precise\nmoment that we were both lying on our backs with a wild expression of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere am I? and what is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d on our faces, and our four feet waving\nmadly in the air.\n\nOur feet were undoubtedly the leading article in that photograph.\nIndeed, very little else was to be seen.  They filled up the foreground\nentirely.  Behind them, you caught glimpses of the other boats, and bits\nof the surrounding scenery; but everything and everybody else in the lock\nlooked so utterly insignificant and paltry compared with our feet, that\nall the other people felt quite ashamed of themselves, and refused to\nsubscribe to the picture.\n\nThe owner of one steam launch, who had bespoke six copies, rescinded the\norder on seeing the negative.  He said he would take them if anybody\ncould show him his launch, but nobody could.  It was somewhere behind\nGeorge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right foot.\n\nThere was a good deal of unpleasantness over the business.  The\nphotographer thought we ought to take a dozen copies each, seeing that\nthe photo was about nine-tenths us, but we declined.  We said we had no\nobjection to being photo\u00e2\u0080\u0099d full-length, but we preferred being taken the\nright way up.\n\nWallingford, six miles above Streatley, is a very ancient town, and has\nbeen an active centre for the making of English history.  It was a rude,\nmud-built town in the time of the Britons, who squatted there, until the\nRoman legions evicted them; and replaced their clay-baked walls by mighty\nfortifications, the trace of which Time has not yet succeeded in sweeping\naway, so well those old-world masons knew how to build.\n\nBut Time, though he halted at Roman walls, soon crumbled Romans to dust;\nand on the ground, in later years, fought savage Saxons and huge Danes,\nuntil the Normans came.\n\nIt was a walled and fortified town up to the time of the Parliamentary\nWar, when it suffered a long and bitter siege from Fairfax.  It fell at\nlast, and then the walls were razed.\n\nFrom Wallingford up to Dorchester the neighbourhood of the river grows\nmore hilly, varied, and picturesque.  Dorchester stands half a mile from\nthe river.  It can be reached by paddling up the Thame, if you have a\nsmall boat; but the best way is to leave the river at Day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lock, and\ntake a walk across the fields.  Dorchester is a delightfully peaceful old\nplace, nestling in stillness and silence and drowsiness.\n\nDorchester, like Wallingford, was a city in ancient British times; it was\nthen called Caer Doren, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe city on the water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  In more recent times\nthe Romans formed a great camp here, the fortifications surrounding which\nnow seem like low, even hills.  In Saxon days it was the capital of\nWessex.  It is very old, and it was very strong and great once.  Now it\nsits aside from the stirring world, and nods and dreams.\n\nRound Clifton Hampden, itself a wonderfully pretty village,\nold-fashioned, peaceful, and dainty with flowers, the river scenery is\nrich and beautiful.  If you stay the night on land at Clifton, you cannot\ndo better than put up at the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarley Mow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  It is, without exception, I\nshould say, the quaintest, most old-world inn up the river.  It stands on\nthe right of the bridge, quite away from the village.  Its low-pitched\ngables and thatched roof and latticed windows give it quite a story-book\nappearance, while inside it is even still more once-upon-a-timeyfied.\n\nIt would not be a good place for the heroine of a modern novel to stay\nat.  The heroine of a modern novel is always \u00e2\u0080\u009cdivinely tall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she is\never \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrawing herself up to her full height.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  At the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarley Mow\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nwould bump her head against the ceiling each time she did this.\n\nIt would also be a bad house for a drunken man to put up at.  There are\ntoo many surprises in the way of unexpected steps down into this room and\nup into that; and as for getting upstairs to his bedroom, or ever finding\nhis bed when he got up, either operation would be an utter impossibility\nto him.\n\nWe were up early the next morning, as we wanted to be in Oxford by the\nafternoon.  It is surprising how early one _can_ get up, when camping\nout.  One does not yearn for \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust another five minutes\u00e2\u0080\u009d nearly so much,\nlying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag\nfor a pillow, as one does in a featherbed.  We had finished breakfast,\nand were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight.\n\nFrom Clifton to Culham the river banks are flat, monotonous, and\nuninteresting, but, after you get through Culhalm Lock\u00e2\u0080\u0094the coldest and\ndeepest lock on the river\u00e2\u0080\u0094the landscape improves.\n\nAt Abingdon, the river passes by the streets.  Abingdon is a typical\ncountry town of the smaller order\u00e2\u0080\u0094quiet, eminently respectable, clean,\nand desperately dull.  It prides itself on being old, but whether it can\ncompare in this respect with Wallingford and Dorchester seems doubtful.\nA famous abbey stood here once, and within what is left of its sanctified\nwalls they brew bitter ale nowadays.\n\nIn St. Nicholas Church, at Abingdon, there is a monument to John\nBlackwall and his wife Jane, who both, after leading a happy married\nlife, died on the very same day, August 21, 1625; and in St. Helen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nChurch, it is recorded that W. Lee, who died in 1637, \u00e2\u0080\u009chad in his\nlifetime issue from his loins two hundred lacking but three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  If you\nwork this out you will find that Mr. W. Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family numbered one hundred\nand ninety-seven.  Mr. W. Lee\u00e2\u0080\u0094five times Mayor of Abingdon\u00e2\u0080\u0094was, no doubt,\na benefactor to his generation, but I hope there are not many of his kind\nabout in this overcrowded nineteenth century.\n\nFrom Abingdon to Nuneham Courteney is a lovely stretch.  Nuneham Park is\nwell worth a visit.  It can be viewed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The\nhouse contains a fine collection of pictures and curiosities, and the\ngrounds are very beautiful.\n\nThe pool under Sandford lasher, just behind the lock, is a very good\nplace to drown yourself in.  The undercurrent is terribly strong, and if\nyou once get down into it you are all right.  An obelisk marks the spot\nwhere two men have already been drowned, while bathing there; and the\nsteps of the obelisk are generally used as a diving-board by young men\nnow who wish to see if the place really _is_ dangerous.\n\n                          [Picture: River scene]\n\nIffley Lock and Mill, a mile before you reach Oxford, is a favourite\nsubject with the river-loving brethren of the brush.  The real article,\nhowever, is rather disappointing, after the pictures.  Few things, I have\nnoticed, come quite up to the pictures of them, in this world.\n\nWe passed through Iffley Lock at about half-past twelve, and then, having\ntidied up the boat and made all ready for landing, we set to work on our\nlast mile.\n\nBetween Iffley and Oxford is the most difficult bit of the river I know.\nYou want to be born on that bit of water, to understand it.  I have been\nover it a fairish number of times, but I have never been able to get the\nhang of it.  The man who could row a straight course from Oxford to\nIffley ought to be able to live comfortably, under one roof, with his\nwife, his mother-in-law, his elder sister, and the old servant who was in\nthe family when he was a baby.\n\nFirst the current drives you on to the right bank, and then on to the\nleft, then it takes you out into the middle, turns you round three times,\nand carries you up stream again, and always ends by trying to smash you\nup against a college barge.\n\nOf course, as a consequence of this, we got in the way of a good many\nother boats, during the mile, and they in ours, and, of course, as a\nconsequence of that, a good deal of bad language occurred.\n\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why it should be, but everybody is always so exceptionally\nirritable on the river.  Little mishaps, that you would hardly notice on\ndry land, drive you nearly frantic with rage, when they occur on the\nwater.  When Harris or George makes an ass of himself on dry land, I\nsmile indulgently; when they behave in a chuckle-head way on the river, I\nuse the most blood-curdling language to them.  When another boat gets in\nmy way, I feel I want to take an oar and kill all the people in it.\n\nThe mildest tempered people, when on land, become violent and\nblood-thirsty when in a boat.  I did a little boating once with a young\nlady.  She was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition\nimaginable, but on the river it was quite awful to hear her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, drat the man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would exclaim, when some unfortunate sculler\nwould get in her way; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he look where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, bother the silly old thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would say indignantly, when\nthe sail would not go up properly.  And she would catch hold of it, and\nshake it quite brutally.\n\nYet, as I have said, when on shore she was kind-hearted and amiable\nenough.\n\n[Picture: Man at the lock] [Picture: Man at the lock] The air of the\nriver has a demoralising effect upon one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temper, and this it is, I\nsuppose, which causes even barge men to be sometimes rude to one another,\nand to use language which, no doubt, in their calmer moments they regret.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nOxford.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Montmorency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea of Heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The hired up-river boat, its\nbeauties and advantages.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The \u00e2\u0080\u009cPride of the Thames.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094The weather\nchanges.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The river under different aspects.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Not a cheerful\nevening.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yearnings for the unattainable.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The cheery chat goes\nround.\u00e2\u0080\u0094George performs upon the banjo.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A mournful melody.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Another wet\nday.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Flight.\u00e2\u0080\u0094A little supper and a toast.\n\n[Picture: Dog running] We spent two very pleasant days at Oxford.  There\nare plenty of dogs in the town of Oxford.  Montmorency had eleven fights\non the first day, and fourteen on the second, and evidently thought he\nhad got to heaven.\n\n[Picture: Dogs fighting] Among folk too constitutionally weak, or too\nconstitutionally lazy, whichever it may be, to relish up-stream work, it\nis a common practice to get a boat at Oxford, and row down.  For the\nenergetic, however, the up-stream journey is certainly to be preferred.\nIt does not seem good to be always going with the current.  There is more\nsatisfaction in squaring one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back, and fighting against it, and winning\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way forward in spite of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least, so I feel, when Harris and\nGeorge are sculling and I am steering.\n\n[Picture: Dog running] To those who do contemplate making Oxford their\nstarting-place, I would say, take your own boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless, of course, you\ncan take someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s without any possible danger of being found out.\nThe boats that, as a rule, are let for hire on the Thames above Marlow,\nare very good boats.  They are fairly water-tight; and so long as they\nare handled with care, they rarely come to pieces, or sink.  There are\nplaces in them to sit down on, and they are complete with all the\nnecessary arrangements\u00e2\u0080\u0094or nearly all\u00e2\u0080\u0094to enable you to row them and steer\nthem.\n\nBut they are not ornamental.  The boat you hire up the river above Marlow\nis not the sort of boat in which you can flash about and give yourself\nairs.  The hired up-river boat very soon puts a stop to any nonsense of\nthat sort on the part of its occupants.  That is its chief\u00e2\u0080\u0094one may say,\nits only recommendation.\n\n[Picture: Dog] The man in the hired up-river boat is modest and retiring.\nHe likes to keep on the shady side, underneath the trees, and to do most\nof his travelling early in the morning or late at night, when there are\nnot many people about on the river to look at him.\n\nWhen the man in the hired up-river boat sees anyone he knows, he gets out\non to the bank, and hides behind a tree.\n\nI was one of a party who hired an up-river boat one summer, for a few\ndays\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trip.  We had none of us ever seen the hired up-river boat before;\nand we did not know what it was when we did see it.\n\nWe had written for a boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094a double sculling skiff; and when we went down\nwith our bags to the yard, and gave our names, the man said:\n\n[Picture: The Pride of the Thames] \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the party that wrote\nfor a double sculling skiff.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right.  Jim, fetch round _The\nPride of the Thames_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy went, and re-appeared five minutes afterwards, struggling with an\nantediluvian chunk of wood, that looked as though it had been recently\ndug out of somewhere, and dug out carelessly, so as to have been\nunnecessarily damaged in the process.\n\nMy own idea, on first catching sight of the object, was that it was a\nRoman relic of some sort,\u00e2\u0080\u0094relic of _what_ I do not know, possibly of a\ncoffin.\n\nThe neighbourhood of the upper Thames is rich in Roman relics, and my\nsurmise seemed to me a very probable one; but our serious young man, who\nis a bit of a geologist, pooh-poohed my Roman relic theory, and said it\nwas clear to the meanest intellect (in which category he seemed to be\ngrieved that he could not conscientiously include mine) that the thing\nthe boy had found was the fossil of a whale; and he pointed out to us\nvarious evidences proving that it must have belonged to the preglacial\nperiod.\n\nTo settle the dispute, we appealed to the boy.  We told him not to be\nafraid, but to speak the plain truth: Was it the fossil of a pre-Adamite\nwhale, or was it an early Roman coffin?\n\nThe boy said it was _The Pride of the Thames_.\n\nWe thought this a very humorous answer on the part of the boy at first,\nand somebody gave him twopence as a reward for his ready wit; but when he\npersisted in keeping up the joke, as we thought, too long, we got vexed\nwith him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, my lad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said our captain sharply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us have any\nnonsense.  You take your mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s washing-tub home again, and bring us a\nboat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boat-builder himself came up then, and assured us, on his word, as a\npractical man, that the thing really was a boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094was, in fact, _the_ boat,\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cdouble sculling skiff\u00e2\u0080\u009d selected to take us on our trip down the\nriver.\n\nWe grumbled a good deal.  We thought he might, at least, have had it\nwhitewashed or tarred\u00e2\u0080\u0094had _something_ done to it to distinguish it from a\nbit of a wreck; but he could not see any fault in it.\n\nHe even seemed offended at our remarks.  He said he had picked us out the\nbest boat in all his stock, and he thought we might have been more\ngrateful.\n\nHe said it, _The Pride of the Thames_, had been in use, just as it now\nstood (or rather as it now hung together), for the last forty years, to\n_his_ knowledge, and nobody had complained of it before, and he did not\nsee why we should be the first to begin.\n\nWe argued no more.\n\nWe fastened the so-called boat together with some pieces of string, got a\nbit of wall-paper and pasted over the shabbier places, said our prayers,\nand stepped on board.\n\nThey charged us thirty-five shillings for the loan of the remnant for six\ndays; and we could have bought the thing out-and-out for\nfour-and-sixpence at any sale of drift-wood round the coast.\n\nThe weather changed on the third day,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh! I am talking about our present\ntrip now,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and we started from Oxford upon our homeward journey in the\nmidst of a steady drizzle.\n\nThe river\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the sunlight flashing from its dancing wavelets, gilding\ngold the grey-green beech-trunks, glinting through the dark, cool wood\npaths, chasing shadows o\u00e2\u0080\u0099er the shallows, flinging diamonds from the\nmill-wheels, throwing kisses to the lilies, wantoning with the weirs\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nwhite waters, silvering moss-grown walls and bridges, brightening every\ntiny townlet, making sweet each lane and meadow, lying tangled in the\nrushes, peeping, laughing, from each inlet, gleaming gay on many a far\nsail, making soft the air with glory\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a golden fairy stream.\n\nBut the river\u00e2\u0080\u0094chill and weary, with the ceaseless rain-drops falling on\nits brown and sluggish waters, with a sound as of a woman, weeping low in\nsome dark chamber; while the woods, all dark and silent, shrouded in\ntheir mists of vapour, stand like ghosts upon the margin; silent ghosts\nwith eyes reproachful, like the ghosts of evil actions, like the ghosts\nof friends neglected\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a spirit-haunted water through the land of vain\nregrets.\n\nSunlight is the life-blood of Nature.  Mother Earth looks at us with such\ndull, soulless eyes, when the sunlight has died away from out of her.  It\nmakes us sad to be with her then; she does not seem to know us or to care\nfor us.  She is as a widow who has lost the husband she loved, and her\nchildren touch her hand, and look up into her eyes, but gain no smile\nfrom her.\n\nWe rowed on all that day through the rain, and very melancholy work it\nwas.  We pretended, at first, that we enjoyed it.  We said it was a\nchange, and that we liked to see the river under all its different\naspects.  We said we could not expect to have it all sunshine, nor should\nwe wish it.  We told each other that Nature was beautiful, even in her\ntears.\n\n                     [Picture: The boat in the rain]\n\nIndeed, Harris and I were quite enthusiastic about the business, for the\nfirst few hours.  And we sang a song about a gipsy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, and how\ndelightful a gipsy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence was!\u00e2\u0080\u0094free to storm and sunshine, and to\nevery wind that blew!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how he enjoyed the rain, and what a lot of good\nit did him; and how he laughed at people who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.\n\nGeorge took the fun more soberly, and stuck to the umbrella.\n\nWe hoisted the cover before we had lunch, and kept it up all the\nafternoon, just leaving a little space in the bow, from which one of us\ncould paddle and keep a look-out.  In this way we made nine miles, and\npulled up for the night a little below Day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lock.\n\nI cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening.  The rain poured down\nwith quiet persistency.  Everything in the boat was damp and clammy.\nSupper was not a success.  Cold veal pie, when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel hungry, is\napt to cloy.  I felt I wanted whitebait and a cutlet; Harris babbled of\nsoles and white-sauce, and passed the remains of his pie to Montmorency,\nwho declined it, and, apparently insulted by the offer, went and sat over\nat the other end of the boat by himself.\n\nGeorge requested that we would not talk about these things, at all events\nuntil he had finished his cold boiled beef without mustard.\n\nWe played penny nap after supper.  We played for about an hour and a\nhalf, by the end of which time George had won fourpence\u00e2\u0080\u0094George always is\nlucky at cards\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Harris and I had lost exactly twopence each.\n\nWe thought we would give up gambling then.  As Harris said, it breeds an\nunhealthy excitement when carried too far.  George offered to go on and\ngive us our revenge; but Harris and I decided not to battle any further\nagainst Fate.\n\nAfter that, we mixed ourselves some toddy, and sat round and talked.\nGeorge told us about a man he had known, who had come up the river two\nyears ago and who had slept out in a damp boat on just such another night\nas that was, and it had given him rheumatic fever, and nothing was able\nto save him, and he had died in great agony ten days afterwards.  George\nsaid he was quite a young man, and was engaged to be married.  He said it\nwas one of the saddest things he had ever known.\n\nAnd that put Harris in mind of a friend of his, who had been in the\nVolunteers, and who had slept out under canvas one wet night down at\nAldershot, \u00e2\u0080\u009con just such another night as this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris; and he had\nwoke up in the morning a cripple for life.  Harris said he would\nintroduce us both to the man when we got back to town; it would make our\nhearts bleed to see him.\n\nThis naturally led to some pleasant chat about sciatica, fevers, chills,\nlung diseases, and bronchitis; and Harris said how very awkward it would\nbe if one of us were taken seriously ill in the night, seeing how far\naway we were from a doctor.\n\nThere seemed to be a desire for something frolicksome to follow upon this\nconversation, and in a weak moment I suggested that George should get out\nhis banjo, and see if he could not give us a comic song.\n\nI will say for George that he did not want any pressing.  There was no\nnonsense about having left his music at home, or anything of that sort.\nHe at once fished out his instrument, and commenced to play \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo Lovely\nBlack Eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI had always regarded \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo Lovely Black Eyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d as rather a commonplace\ntune until that evening.  The rich vein of sadness that George extracted\nfrom it quite surprised me.\n\nThe desire that grew upon Harris and myself, as the mournful strains\nprogressed, was to fall upon each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necks and weep; but by great\neffort we kept back the rising tears, and listened to the wild yearnful\nmelody in silence.\n\nWhen the chorus came we even made a desperate effort to be merry.  We\nre-filled our glasses and joined in; Harris, in a voice trembling with\nemotion, leading, and George and I following a few words behind:\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo lovely black eyes;\n          Oh! what a surprise!\n    Only for telling a man he was wrong,\n          Two\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere we broke down.  The unutterable pathos of George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accompaniment to\nthat \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo\u00e2\u0080\u009d we were, in our then state of depression, unable to bear.\nHarris sobbed like a little child, and the dog howled till I thought his\nheart or his jaw must surely break.\n\nGeorge wanted to go on with another verse.  He thought that when he had\ngot a little more into the tune, and could throw more \u00e2\u0080\u009cabandon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it\nwere, into the rendering, it might not seem so sad.  The feeling of the\nmajority, however, was opposed to the experiment.\n\nThere being nothing else to do, we went to bed\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, we undressed\nourselves, and tossed about at the bottom of the boat for some three or\nfour hours.  After which, we managed to get some fitful slumber until\nfive a.m., when we all got up and had breakfast.\n\nThe second day was exactly like the first.  The rain continued to pour\ndown, and we sat, wrapped up in our mackintoshes, underneath the canvas,\nand drifted slowly down.\n\nOne of us\u00e2\u0080\u0094I forget which one now, but I rather think it was myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094made a\nfew feeble attempts during the course of the morning to work up the old\ngipsy foolishness about being children of Nature and enjoying the wet;\nbut it did not go down well at all.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n    \u00e2\u0080\u009cI care not for the rain, not I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nwas so painfully evident, as expressing the sentiments of each of us,\nthat to sing it seemed unnecessary.\n\nOn one point we were all agreed, and that was that, come what might, we\nwould go through with this job to the bitter end.  We had come out for a\nfortnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enjoyment on the river, and a fortnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enjoyment on the\nriver we meant to have.  If it killed us! well, that would be a sad thing\nfor our friends and relations, but it could not be helped.  We felt that\nto give in to the weather in a climate such as ours would be a most\ndisastrous precedent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only two days more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we are young and strong.  We\nmay get over it all right, after all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt about four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock we began to discuss our arrangements for the\nevening.  We were a little past Goring then, and we decided to paddle on\nto Pangbourne, and put up there for the night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother jolly evening!\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured George.\n\nWe sat and mused on the prospect.  We should be in at Pangbourne by five.\nWe should finish dinner at, say, half-past six.  After that we could walk\nabout the village in the pouring rain until bed-time; or we could sit in\na dimly-lit bar-parlour and read the almanac.\n\n[Picture: Lady in skirt] \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, the Alhambra would be almost more lively,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nsaid Harris, venturing his head outside the cover for a moment and taking\na survey of the sky.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith a little supper at the --- {311} to follow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I added, half\nunconsciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost a pity we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made up our minds to stick to this boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nanswered Harris; and then there was silence for a while.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we _hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ made up our minds to contract our certain deaths in this\nbally old coffin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed George, casting a glance of intense\nmalevolence over the boat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit might be worth while to mention that\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a train leaves Pangbourne, I know, soon after five, which would\njust land us in town in comfortable time to get a chop, and then go on to\nthe place you mentioned afterwards.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNobody spoke.  We looked at one another, and each one seemed to see his\nown mean and guilty thoughts reflected in the faces of the others.  In\nsilence, we dragged out and overhauled the Gladstone.  We looked up the\nriver and down the river; not a soul was in sight!\n\nTwenty minutes later, three figures, followed by a shamed-looking dog,\nmight have been seen creeping stealthily from the boat-house at the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSwan\u00e2\u0080\u009d towards the railway station, dressed in the following neither neat\nnor gaudy costume:\n\nBlack leather shoes, dirty; suit of boating flannels, very dirty; brown\nfelt hat, much battered; mackintosh, very wet; umbrella.\n\nWe had deceived the boatman at Pangbourne.  We had not had the face to\ntell him that we were running away from the rain.  We had left the boat,\nand all it contained, in his charge, with instructions that it was to be\nready for us at nine the next morning.  If, we said\u00e2\u0080\u0094_if_ anything\nunforeseen should happen, preventing our return, we would write to him.\n\nWe reached Paddington at seven, and drove direct to the restaurant I have\nbefore described, where we partook of a light meal, left Montmorency,\ntogether with suggestions for a supper to be ready at half-past ten, and\nthen continued our way to Leicester Square.\n\nWe attracted a good deal of attention at the Alhambra.  On our presenting\nourselves at the paybox we were gruffly directed to go round to Castle\nStreet, and were informed that we were half-an-hour behind our time.\n\nWe convinced the man, with some difficulty, that we were _not_ \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nworld-renowned contortionists from the Himalaya Mountains,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he took\nour money and let us pass.\n\nInside we were a still greater success.  Our fine bronzed countenances\nand picturesque clothes were followed round the place with admiring gaze.\nWe were the cynosure of every eye.\n\nIt was a proud moment for us all.\n\nWe adjourned soon after the first ballet, and wended our way back to the\nrestaurant, where supper was already awaiting us.\n\nI must confess to enjoying that supper.  For about ten days we seemed to\nhave been living, more or less, on nothing but cold meat, cake, and bread\nand jam.  It had been a simple, a nutritious diet; but there had been\nnothing exciting about it, and the odour of Burgundy, and the smell of\nFrench sauces, and the sight of clean napkins and long loaves, knocked as\na very welcome visitor at the door of our inner man.\n\nWe pegged and quaffed away in silence for a while, until the time came\nwhen, instead of sitting bolt upright, and grasping the knife and fork\nfirmly, we leant back in our chairs and worked slowly and carelessly\u00e2\u0080\u0094when\nwe stretched out our legs beneath the table, let our napkins fall,\nunheeded, to the floor, and found time to more critically examine the\nsmoky ceiling than we had hitherto been able to do\u00e2\u0080\u0094when we rested our\nglasses at arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-length upon the table, and felt good, and thoughtful,\nand forgiving.\n\nThen Harris, who was sitting next the window, drew aside the curtain and\nlooked out upon the street.\n\nIt glistened darkly in the wet, the dim lamps flickered with each gust,\nthe rain splashed steadily into the puddles and trickled down the\nwater-spouts into the running gutters.  A few soaked wayfarers hurried\npast, crouching beneath their dripping umbrellas, the women holding up\ntheir skirts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Harris, reaching his hand out for his glass, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have had a\npleasant trip, and my hearty thanks for it to old Father Thames\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I\nthink we did well to chuck it when we did.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to Three Men well out\nof a Boat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Montmorency, standing on his hind legs, before the window, peering\nout into the night, gave a short bark of decided concurrence with the\ntoast.\n\n                   [Picture: Neptune drinking a toast]\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes.\n\n\n{287}  Or rather _were_.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1000,"split":"train"}
