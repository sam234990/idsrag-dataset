Each story is set against a specific background.\nIn Cardinal Manning's story, the background is the creation of the Oxford Movement and the defection of an influential group of Church of England clergy to the Catholic Church. This aspect is covered in depth to explain the movement and its main protagonists, particularly Manning's hostile relationship with John Henry Newman. Strachey is critical of Manning's underhand manipulations in attempting to prevent Newman being made a Cardinal.\nThe background features of Florence Nightingale's story are the machinations of the War Office, and the obtuseness of the military and politicians. Influenced by Sigmund Freud, Strachey depicts Florence Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who is both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.\nDr Arnold is hailed as an exemplar who established the Public School system. Strachey describes this as an education based on chapel and the classics, with a prefectorial system to maintain order. He points out that it was not Arnold who was responsible for the obsession with sport, but does make it clear that Arnold was at fault in ignoring the sciences. Although Arnold was revered at the time, in retrospect Strachey sees his approach as very damaging. Strachey also mocks Arnold's efforts at moral improvement of the general public, for example his unsuccessful weekly newspaper.\nGordon\u2019s is the story of a maverick soldier and adventurer, whose original military achievements in China would have been forgotten. He was a mercenary who got into and out of conflicts on behalf of various dubious governments, but much of his experience was in the Sudan. The final disaster was when the Egyptian occupation of Sudan was almost completely overthrown by fundamentalist rebels, and someone was needed to retrieve the situation in Khartoum. The job fell to Gordon, whose instincts were to do anything but withdraw, and he became embroiled in a siege. The British government was put in an almost impossible dilemma, and when eventually they did send a relief expedition it arrived just two days too late. Strachey based Gordon\u2019s story on his diaries and letters to give an account of a strong individual almost at odds with the world.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Eminent Victorians, by Lytton Strachey\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

For ignorance is the first requisite of the historian--ignorance,\nwhich simplifies and clarifies, which selects and omits, with a placid\nperfection unattainable by the highest art. Concerning the Age which has\njust passed, our fathers and our grandfathers have poured forth and\naccumulated so vast a quantity of information that the industry of a\nRanke would be submerged by it, and the perspicacity of a Gibbon would\nquail before it. It is not by the direct method of a scrupulous\nnarration that the explorer of the past can hope to depict that singular\nepoch. If he is wise, he will adopt a subtler strategy. He will attack\nhis subject in unexpected places; he will fall upon the flank, or the\nrear; he will shoot a sudden, revealing searchlight into obscure\nrecesses, hitherto undivined. He will row out over that great ocean of\nmaterial, and lower down into it, here and there, a little bucket, which\nwill bring up to the light of day some characteristic specimen, from\nthose far depths, to be examined with a careful curiosity. Guided by\nthese considerations, I have written the ensuing studies. I have\nattempted, through the medium of biography, to present some Victorian\nvisions to the modern eye. They are, in one sense, haphazard\nvisions--that is to say, my choice of subjects has been determined by no\ndesire to construct a system or to prove a theory, but by simple motives\nof convenience and of art. It has been my purpose to illustrate rather\nthan to explain. It would have been futile to hope to tell even a precis\nof the truth about the Victorian age, for the shortest precis must fill\ninnumerable volumes. But, in the lives of an ecclesiastic, an\neducational authority, a woman of action, and a man of adventure, I have\nsought to examine and elucidate certain fragments of the truth which\ntook my fancy and lay to my hand.\n\nI hope, however, that the following pages may prove to be of interest\nfrom the strictly biographical, no less than from the historical point\nof view. Human beings are too important to be treated as mere symptoms\nof the past. They have a value which is independent of any temporal\nprocesses--which is eternal, and must be felt for its own sake. The art\nof biography seems to have fallen on evil times in England. We have had,\nit is true, a few masterpieces, but we have never had, like the French,\na great biographical tradition; we have had no Fontenelles and\nCondorcets, with their incomparable eloges, compressing into a few\nshining pages the manifold existences of men. With us, the most delicate\nand humane of all the branches of the art of writing has been relegated\nto the journeymen of letters; we do not reflect that it is perhaps as\ndifficult to write a good life as to live one. Those two fat volumes,\nwith which it is our custom to commemorate the dead--who does not know\nthem, with their ill-digested masses of material, their slipshod style,\ntheir tone of tedious panegyric, their lamentable lack of selection, of\ndetachment, of design? They are as familiar as the cortege of the\nundertaker, and wear the same air of slow, funereal barbarism. One is\ntempted to suppose, of some of them, that they were composed by that\nfunctionary as the final item of his job. The studies in this book are\nindebted, in more ways than one, to such works--works which certainly\ndeserve the name of Standard Biographies. For they have provided me not\nonly with much indispensable information, but with something even more\nprecious--an example. How many lessons are to be learned from them! But\nit is hardly necessary to particularise. To preserve, for instance, a\nbecoming brevity--a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant\nand nothing that is significant--that, surely, is the first duty of the\nbiographer. The second, no less surely, is to maintain his own freedom\nof spirit. It is not his business to be complimentary; it is his\nbusiness to lay bare the facts of the case, as he understands them. That\nis what I have aimed at in this book--to lay bare the facts of some\ncases, as I understand them, dispassionately, impartially, and without\nulterior intentions. To quote the words of a Master--'Je n'impose rien;\nje ne propose rien: j'expose.'\n\nL.S.\n\nA list of the principal sources from which I have drawn is appended to\neach Biography. I would indicate, as an honourable exception to the\ncurrent commodity, Sir Edward Cook's excellent Life of Florence\nNightingale, without which my own study, though composed on a very\ndifferent scale and from a decidedly different angle, could not have\nbeen written.\n\n\n\nCardinal Manning\n\n\nHENRY EDWARD MANNING was born in 1807 and died in 1892. His life was\nextraordinary in many ways, but its interest for the modern inquirer\ndepends mainly upon two considerations--the light which his career\nthrows upon the spirit of his age, and the psychological problems\nsuggested by his inner history. He belonged to that class of eminent\necclesiastics--and it is by no means a small class--who have been\ndistinguished less for saintliness and learning than for practical\nability. Had he lived in the Middle Ages he would certainly have been\nneither a Francis nor an Aquinas, but he might have been an Innocent. As\nit was, born in the England of the nineteenth century, growing up in the\nvery seed-time of modern progress, coming to maturity with the first\nonrush of Liberalism, and living long enough to witness the victories of\nScience and Democracy, he yet, by a strange concatenation of\ncircumstances, seemed almost to revive in his own person that long line\nof diplomatic and administrative clerics which, one would have thought,\nhad come to an end for ever with Cardinal Wolsey.\n\nIn Manning, so it appeared, the Middle Ages lived again. The tall gaunt\nfigure, with the face of smiling asceticism, the robes, and the biretta,\nas it passed in triumph from High Mass at the Oratory to philanthropic\ngatherings at Exeter Hall, from Strike Committees at the Docks to\nMayfair drawing-rooms where fashionable ladies knelt to the Prince of\nthe Church, certainly bore witness to a singular condition of affairs.\nWhat had happened? Had a dominating character imposed itself upon a\nhostile environment? Or was the nineteenth century, after all, not so\nhostile? Was there something in it, scientific and progressive as it\nwas, which went out to welcome the representative of ancient tradition\nand uncompromising faith? Had it, perhaps, a place in its heart for such\nas Manning--a soft place, one might almost say? Or, on the other hand,\nwas it he who had been supple and yielding? He who had won by art what\nhe would never have won by force, and who had managed, so to speak, to\nbe one of the leaders of the procession less through merit than through\na superior faculty for gliding adroitly to the front rank? And, in any\ncase, by what odd chances, what shifts and struggles, what combinations\nof circumstance and character, had this old man come to be where he was?\nSuch questions are easier to ask than to answer; but it may be\ninstructive, and even amusing, to look a little more closely into the\ncomplexities of so curious a story.\n\n\nI\n\nUNDOUBTEDLY, what is most obviously striking in the history of Manning's\ncareer is the persistent strength of his innate characteristics. Through\nall the changes of his fortunes the powerful spirit of the man worked on\nundismayed. It was as if the Fates had laid a wager that they would\ndaunt him; and in the end they lost their bet.\n\nHis father was a rich West Indian merchant, a governor of the Bank of\nEngland, a Member of Parliament, who drove into town every day from his\ncountry seat in a coach and four, and was content with nothing short of\na bishop for the christening of his children. Little Henry, like the\nrest, had his bishop; but he was obliged to wait for him--for as long as\neighteen months. In those days, and even a generation later, as Keble\nbears witness, there was great laxity in regard to the early baptism of\nchildren. The delay has been noted by Manning's biographer as the first\nstumbling-block in the spiritual life of the future Cardinal; but he\nsurmounted it with success.\n\nHis father was more careful in other ways.\n\n'His refinement and delicacy of mind were such,' wrote Manning long\nafterwards, 'that I never heard out of his mouth a word which might not\nhave been spoken in the presence of the most pure and sensitive--except,'\nhe adds, 'on one occasion. He was then forced by others to repeat a\nnegro story which, though free from all evil de sexu, was indelicate. He\ndid it with great resistance. His example gave me a hatred of all such\ntalk.'\n\nThe family lived in an atmosphere of Evangelical piety. One day the\nlittle boy came in from the farmyard, and his mother asked him whether\nhe had seen the peacock. 'I said yes, and the nurse said no, and my\nmother made me kneel down and beg God to forgive me for not speaking the\ntruth.' At the age of four the child was told by a cousin of the age of\nsix that 'God had a book in which He wrote down everything we did wrong.\nThis so terrified me for days that I remember being found by my mother\nsitting under a kind of writing-table in great fear. I never forgot this\nat any time in my life,' the Cardinal tells us, 'and it has been a great\ngrace to me.' When he was nine years old he 'devoured the Apocalypse;\nand I never all through my life forgot the \"lake that burneth with fire\nand brimstone\". That verse has kept me like an audible voice through all\nmy life, and through worlds of danger in my youth.'\n\nAt Harrow the worlds of danger were already around him; but yet he\nlistened to the audible voice. 'At school and college I never failed to\nsay my prayers, so far as memory serves me, even for a day.' And he\nunderwent another religious experience: he read Paley's Evidences. 'I\ntook in the whole argument,' wrote Manning, when he was over seventy,\n'and I thank God that nothing has ever shaken it.' Yet on the whole he\nled the unspiritual life of an ordinary schoolboy. We have glimpses of\nhim as a handsome lad, playing cricket, or strutting about in tasselled\nHessian top-boots. And on one occasion at least he gave proof of a\ncertain dexterity of conduct which deserved to be remembered. He went\nout of bounds, and a master, riding by and seeing him on the other side\nof a field, tied his horse to a gate, and ran after him. The astute\nyouth outran the master, fetched a circle, reached the gate, jumped on\nto the horse's back and rode off. For this he was very properly\nchastised; but, of what use was chastisement? No whipping, however\nsevere, could have eradicated from little Henry's mind a quality at\nleast as firmly planted in it as his fear of Hell and his belief in the\narguments of Paley.\n\nIt had been his father's wish that Manning should go into the Church;\nbut the thought disgusted him; and when he reached Oxford, his tastes,\nhis ambitions, his successes at the Union, all seemed to mark him out\nfor a political career. He was a year junior to Samuel Wilberforce, and\na year senior to Gladstone. In those days the Union was the\nrecruiting-ground for young politicians; Ministers came down from London\nto listen to the debates; and a few years later the Duke of Newcastle\ngave Gladstone a pocket borough on the strength of his speech at the\nUnion against the Reform Bill. To those three young men, indeed, the\nwhole world lay open. Were they not rich, well-connected, and endowed\nwith an infinite capacity for making speeches? The event justified the\nhighest expectations of their friends; for the least distinguished of\nthe three died a bishop. The only danger lay in another direction.\n\n'Watch, my dear Samuel,' wrote the elder Wilberforce to his son, 'watch\nwith jealousy whether you find yourself unduly solicitous about\nacquitting yourself; whether you are too much chagrined when you fail,\nor are puffed up by your success. Undue solicitude about popular\nestimation is a weakness against which all real Christians must guard\nwith the utmost jealous watchfulness. The more you can retain the\nimpression of your being surrounded by a cloud of witnesses of the\ninvisible world, to use the scripture phrase, the more you will be armed\nagainst this besetting sin.'\n\nBut suddenly it seemed as if such a warning could, after all, have very\nlittle relevance to Manning; for, on his leaving Oxford, the brimming\ncup was dashed from his lips. He was already beginning to dream of\nhimself in the House of Commons, the solitary advocate of some great\ncause whose triumph was to be eventually brought about by his\nextraordinary efforts, when his father was declared a bankrupt, and all\nhis hopes of a political career came to an end forever.\n\nIt was at this time that Manning became intimate with a pious lady, the\nsister of one of his College friends, whom he used to describe as his\nSpiritual Mother. He made her his confidante; and one day, as they\nwalked together in the shrubbery, he revealed the bitterness of the\ndisappointment into which his father's failure had plunged him. She\ntried to cheer him, and then she added that there were higher aims open\nto him which he had not considered. 'What do you mean?' he asked. 'The\nkingdom of Heaven,' she answered; 'heavenly ambitions are not closed\nagainst you.' The young man listened, was silent, and said at last that\nhe did not know but she was right. She suggested reading the Bible\ntogether; and they accordingly did so during the whole of that Vacation,\nevery morning after breakfast. Yet, in spite of these devotional\nexercises, and in spite of a voluminous correspondence on religious\nsubjects with his Spiritual Mother, Manning still continued to indulge\nin secular hopes. He entered the Colonial Office as a supernumerary\nclerk, and it was only when the offer of a Merton Fellowship seemed to\ndepend upon his taking orders that his heavenly ambitions began to\nassume a definite shape. Just then he fell in love with Miss Deffell,\nwhose father would have nothing to say to a young man without prospects,\nand forbade him the house. It was only too true; what WERE the prospects\nof a supernumerary clerk in the Colonial Office? Manning went to Oxford\nand took orders. He was elected to the Merton Fellowship, and obtained\nthrough the influence of the Wilberforces a curacy in Sussex. At the\nlast moment he almost drew back. 'I think the whole step has been too\nprecipitate,' he wrote to his brother-in-law. 'I have rather allowed the\ninstance of my friends, and the allurements of an agreeable curacy in\nmany respects, to get the better of my sober judgment.' His vast\nambitions, his dreams of public service, of honours, and of power, was\nall this to end in a little country curacy 'agreeable in many respects'?\nBut there was nothing for it; the deed was done; and the Fates had\napparently succeeded very effectively in getting rid of Manning. All he\ncould do was to make the best of a bad business.\n\nAccordingly, in the first place, he decided that he had received a call\nfrom God 'ad veritatem et ad seipsum'; and, in the second, forgetting\nMiss Deffell, he married his rector's daughter. Within a few months the\nrector died, and Manning stepped into his shoes; and at least it could\nbe said that the shoes were not uncomfortable. For the next seven years\nhe fulfilled the functions of a country clergyman. He was energetic and\ndevout; he was polite and handsome; his fame grew in the diocese. At\nlast he began to be spoken of as the probable successor to the old\nArchdeacon of Chichester. When Mrs. Manning prematurely died, he was at\nfirst inconsolable, but he found relief in the distraction of redoubled\nwork. How could he have guessed that one day he would come to number\nthat loss among 'God's special mercies? Yet so it was to be. In after\nyears, the memory of his wife seemed to be blotted from his mind; he\nnever spoke of her; every letter, every record, of his married life he\ndestroyed; and when word was sent to him that her grave was falling into\nruin: 'It is best so,' the Cardinal answered, 'let it be. Time effaces\nall things.' But, when the grave was yet fresh, the young Rector would\nsit beside it, day after day, writing his sermons.\n\n\nII\n\nIN the meantime, a series of events was taking place in another part of\nEngland, which was to have a no less profound effect upon Manning's\nhistory than the merciful removal of his wife. In the same year in which\nhe took up his Sussex curacy, the Tracts for the Times had begun to\nappear at Oxford. The 'Oxford Movement', in fact, had started on its\ncourse. The phrase is still familiar; but its meaning has become\nsomewhat obscured both by the lapse of time and the intrinsic ambiguity\nof the subjects connected with it. Let us borrow for a moment the wings\nof Historic Imagination, and, hovering lightly over the Oxford of the\nthirties, take a rapid bird's-eye view.\n\nFor many generations the Church of England had slept the sleep of the\n...comfortable. The sullen murmurings of dissent, the loud battle-cry of\nRevolution, had hardly disturbed her slumbers. Portly divines subscribed\nwith a sigh or a smile to the Thirty-nine Articles, sank quietly into\neasy living, rode gaily to hounds of a morning as gentlemen should, and,\nas gentlemen should, carried their two bottles of an evening. To be in\nthe Church was in fact simply to pursue one of those professions which\nNature and Society had decided were proper to gentlemen and gentlemen\nalone. The fervours of piety, the zeal of Apostolic charity, the\nenthusiasm of self-renunciation--these things were all very well in\ntheir way and in their place; but their place was certainly not the\nChurch of England. Gentlemen were neither fervid nor zealous, and above\nall they were not enthusiastic. There were, it was true, occasionally to\nbe found within the Church some strait-laced parsons of the high Tory\nschool who looked back with regret to the days of Laud or talked of the\nApostolical Succession; and there were groups of square-toed\nEvangelicals who were earnest over the Atonement, confessed to a\npersonal love of Jesus Christ, and seemed to have arranged the whole of\ntheir lives, down to the minutest details of act and speech, with\nreference to Eternity. But such extremes were the rare exceptions. The\ngreat bulk of the clergy walked calmly along the smooth road of ordinary\nduty. They kept an eye on the poor of the parish, and they conducted the\nSunday Services in a becoming manner; for the rest, they differed\nneither outwardly nor inwardly from the great bulk of the laity, to whom\nthe Church was a useful organisation for the maintenance of Religion, as\nby law established.\n\nThe awakening came at last, however, and it was a rude one. The liberal\nprinciples of the French Revolution, checked at first in the terrors of\nreaction, began to make their way into England. Rationalists lifted up\ntheir heads; Bentham and the Mills propounded Utilitarianism; the Reform\nBill was passed; and there were rumours abroad of disestablishment. Even\nChurchmen seemed to have caught the infection. Dr. Whately was so bold\nas to assert that, in the interpretation of Scripture, different\nopinions might be permitted upon matters of doubt; and, Dr. Arnold drew\nup a disquieting scheme for allowing Dissenters into the Church, though\nit is true that he did not go quite so far as to contemplate the\nadmission of Unitarians.\n\nAt this time, there was living in a country parish, a young clergyman of\nthe name of John Keble. He had gone to Oxford at the age of fifteen,\nwhere, after a successful academic career, he had been made a Fellow of\nOriel. He had then returned to his father's parish and taken up the\nduties of a curate. He had a thorough knowledge of the contents of the\nPrayer-book, the ways of a Common Room, the conjugations of the Greek\nIrregular Verbs, and the small jests of a country parsonage; and the\ndefects of his experience in other directions were replaced by a zeal\nand a piety which were soon to prove themselves equal, and more than\nequal, to whatever calls might be made upon them. The superabundance of\nhis piety overflowed into verse; and the holy simplicity of the\nChristian Year carried his name into the remotest lodging-houses of\nEngland.\n\nAs for his zeal, however, it needed another outlet. Looking forth upon\nthe doings of his fellow-men through his rectory windows in\nGloucestershire, Keble felt his whole soul shaken with loathing, anger,\nand dread. Infidelity was stalking through the land; authority was\nlaughed at; the hideous doctrines of Democracy were being openly\npreached. Worse still, if possible, the Church herself was ignorant and\nlukewarm; she had forgotten the mysteries of the sacraments, she had\nlost faith in the Apostolical Succession; she was no longer interested\nin the Early Fathers; and she submitted herself to the control of a\nsecular legislature, the members of which were not even bound to profess\nbelief in the Atonement. In the face of such enormities what could Keble\ndo? He was ready to do anything, but he was a simple and an unambitious\nman, and his wrath would in all probability have consumed itself\nunappeased within him had he not chanced to come into contact, at the\ncritical moment, with a spirit more excitable and daring than his own.\n\nHurrell Froude, one of Keble's pupils, was a clever young man to whom\nhad fallen a rather larger share of self-assurance and intolerance than\neven clever young men usually possess. What was singular about him,\nhowever, was not so much his temper as his tastes. The sort of ardour\nwhich impels more normal youths to haunt Music Halls and fall in love\nwith actresses took the form, in Froude's case, of a romantic devotion\nto the Deity and an intense interest in the state of his own soul. He\nwas obsessed by the ideals of saintliness, and convinced of the supreme\nimportance of not eating too much. He kept a diary in which he recorded\nhis delinquencies, and they were many. 'I cannot say much for myself\ntoday,' he writes on September 29th, 1826 (he was twenty-three years\nold). 'I did not read the Psalms and Second Lesson after breakfast,\nwhich I had neglected to do before, though I had plenty of time on my\nhands. Would have liked to be thought adventurous for a scramble I had\nat the Devil's Bridge. Looked with greediness to see if there was a\ngoose on the table for dinner; and though what I ate was of the plainest\nsort, and I took no variety, yet even this was partly the effect of\naccident, and I certainly rather exceeded in quantity, as I was fuzzy\nand sleepy after dinner.' 'I allowed myself to be disgusted, with--'s\npomposity,' he writes a little later, 'also smiled at an allusion in the\nLessons to abstemiousness in eating. I hope not from pride or vanity,\nbut mistrust; it certainly was unintentional.' And again, 'As to my\nmeals, I can say that I was always careful to see that no one else would\ntake a thing before I served myself; and I believe as to the kind of my\nfood, a bit of cold endings of a dab at breakfast, and a scrap of\nmackerel at dinner, are the only things that diverged from the strict\nrule of simplicity.' 'I am obliged to confess,' he notes, 'that in my\nintercourse with the Supreme Being, I am be come more and more\nsluggish.' And then he exclaims: 'Thine eye trieth my inward parts, and\nknoweth my thoughts ... Oh that my ways were made so direct that I might\nkeep Thy statutes. I will walk in Thy Commandments when Thou hast set my\nheart at liberty.'\n\nSuch were the preoccupations of this young man. Perhaps they would have\nbeen different, if he had had a little less of what Newman describes as\nhis 'high severe idea of the intrinsic excellence of Virginity'; but it\nis useless to speculate.\n\nNaturally enough the fierce and burning zeal of Keble had a profound\neffect upon his mind. The two became intimate friends, and Froude,\neagerly seizing upon the doctrines of the elder man, saw to it that they\nhad as full a measure of controversial notoriety as an Oxford common\nroom could afford. He plunged the metaphysical mysteries of the Holy\nCatholic Church into the atmosphere of party politics. Surprised Doctors\nof Divinity found themselves suddenly faced with strange questions which\nhad never entered their heads before. Was the Church of England, or was\nit not, a part of the Church Catholic? If it was, were not the Reformers\nof the sixteenth century renegades? Was not the participation of the\nBody and Blood of Christ essential to the maintenance of Christian life\nand hope in each individual? Were Timothy and Titus Bishops? Or were\nthey not? If they were, did it not follow that the power of\nadministering the Holy Eucharist was the attribute of a sacred order\nfounded by Christ Himself? Did not the Fathers refer to the tradition of\nthe Church as to something independent of the written word, and\nsufficient to refute heresy, even alone? Was it not, therefore, God's\nunwritten word? And did it not demand the same reverence from us as the\nScriptures, and for exactly the same reason--BECAUSE IT WAS HIS WORD?\nThe Doctors of Divinity were aghast at such questions, which seemed to\nlead they hardly knew whither; and they found it difficult to think of\nvery apposite answers. But Hurrell Froude supplied the answers himself\nreadily enough. All Oxford, all England, should know the truth. The time\nwas out of joint, and he was only too delighted to have been born to set\nit right.\n\nBut, after all, something more was needed than even the excitement of\nFroude combined with the conviction of Keble to ruffle seriously the\nvast calm waters of Christian thought; and it so happened that that\nthing was not wanting: it was the genius of John Henry Newman. If Newman\nhad never lived, or if his father, when the gig came round on the fatal\nmorning, still undecided between the two Universities, had chanced to\nturn the horse's head in the direction of Cambridge, who can doubt that\nthe Oxford Movement would have flickered out its little flame unobserved\nin the Common Room of Oriel? And how different, too, would have been the\nfate of Newman himself! He was a child of the Romantic Revival, a\ncreature of emotion and of memory, a dreamer whose secret spirit dwelt\napart in delectable mountains, an artist whose subtle senses caught,\nlike a shower in the sunshine, the impalpable rainbow of the immaterial\nworld. In other times, under other skies, his days would have been more\nfortunate. He might have helped to weave the garland of Meleager, or to\nmix the lapis lazuli of Fra Angelico, or to chase the delicate truth in\nthe shade of an Athenian palaestra, or his hands might have fashioned\nthose ethereal faces that smile in the niches of Chartres. Even in his\nown age he might, at Cambridge, whose cloisters have ever been\nconsecrated to poetry and common sense, have followed quietly in Gray's\nfootsteps and brought into flower those seeds of inspiration which now\nlie embedded amid the faded devotion of the Lyra Apostolica.\n\nAt Oxford, he was doomed. He could not withstand the last enchantment of\nthe Middle Age. It was in vain that he plunged into the pages of Gibbon\nor communed for long hours with Beethoven over his beloved violin. The\nair was thick with clerical sanctity, heavy with the odours of tradition\nand the soft warmth of spiritual authority; his friendship with Hurrell\nFroude did the rest. All that was weakest in him hurried him onward, and\nall that was strongest in him too. His curious and vaulting imagination\nbegan to construct vast philosophical fabrics out of the writings of\nancient monks, and to dally with visions of angelic visitations and the\nefficacy of the oil of St Walburga; his emotional nature became absorbed\nin the partisan passions of a University clique; and his subtle\nintellect concerned itself more and more exclusively with the\ndialectical splitting of dogmatical hairs. His future course was marked\nout for him all too clearly; and yet by a singular chance the true\nnature of the man was to emerge triumphant in the end. If Newman had\ndied at the age of sixty, today he would have been already forgotten,\nsave by a few ecclesiastical historians; but he lived to write his\nApologia, and to reach immortality, neither as a thinker nor as a\ntheologian, but as an artist who has embalmed the poignant history of an\nintensely human spirit in the magical spices of words.\n\nWhen Froude succeeded in impregnating Newman with the ideas of Keble,\nthe Oxford Movement began. The original and remarkable characteristic of\nthese three men was that they took the Christian Religion au pied de la\nlettre. This had not been done in England for centuries. When they\ndeclared every Sunday that they believed in the Holy Catholic Church,\nthey meant it. When they repeated the Athanasian Creed, they meant it.\nEven, when they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles, they meant it-or\nat least they thought they did. Now such a state of mind was\ndangerous--more dangerous indeed--than they at first realised. They had\nstarted with the innocent assumption that the Christian Religion was\ncontained in the doctrines of the Church of England; but, the more they\nexamined this matter, the more difficult and dubious it became. The\nChurch of England bore everywhere upon it the signs of human\nimperfection; it was the outcome of revolution and of compromise, of the\nexigencies of politicians and the caprices of princes, of the prejudices\nof theologians and the necessities of the State. How had it happened\nthat this piece of patchwork had become the receptacle for the august\nand infinite mysteries of the Christian Faith? This was the problem with\nwhich Newman and his friends found themselves confronted. Other men\nmight, and apparently did, see nothing very strange in such a situation;\nbut other men saw in Christianity itself scarcely more than a convenient\nand respectable appendage to existence, by which a sound system of\nmorals was inculcated, and through which one might hope to attain to\neverlasting bliss.\n\nTo Newman and Keble it was otherwise. They saw a transcendent\nmanifestation of Divine power flowing down elaborate and immense through\nthe ages; a consecrated priesthood, stretching back, through the mystic\nsymbol of the laying on of hands, to the very Godhead; a whole universe\nof spiritual beings brought into communion with the Eternal by means of\nwafers; a great mass of metaphysical doctrines, at once incomprehensible\nand of incalculable import, laid down with infinite certitude; they saw\nthe supernatural everywhere and at all times, a living force, floating\ninvisible in angels, inspiring saints, and investing with miraculous\nproperties the commonest material things. No wonder that they found such\na spectacle hard to bring into line with the institution which had been\nevolved from the divorce of Henry VIII, the intrigues of Elizabethan\nparliaments, and the Revolution of 1688. They did, no doubt, soon\nsatisfy themselves that they had succeeded in this apparently hopeless\ntask; but, the conclusions which they came to in order to do so were\ndecidedly startling.\n\nThe Church of England, they declared, was indeed the one true Church,\nbut she had been under an eclipse since the Reformation; in fact, since\nshe had begun to exist. She had, it is true, escaped the corruptions of\nRome; but she had become enslaved by the secular power, and degraded by\nthe false doctrines of Protestantism. The Christian Religion was still\npreserved intact by the English priesthood, but it was preserved, as it\nwere, unconsciously--a priceless deposit, handed down blindly from\ngeneration to generation, and subsisting less by the will of man than\nthrough the ordinance of God as expressed in the mysterious virtue of\nthe Sacraments. Christianity, in short, had become entangled in a series\nof unfortunate circumstances from which it was the plain duty of Newman\nand his friends to rescue it forthwith. What was curious was that this\ntask had been reserved, in so marked a manner, for them. Some of the\ndivines of the seventeenth century had, perhaps, been vouchsafed\nglimpses of the truth; but they were glimpses and nothing more. No, the\nwaters of the true Faith had dived underground at the Reformation, and\nthey were waiting for the wand of Newman to strike the rock before they\nshould burst forth once more into the light of day. The whole matter, no\ndoubt, was Providential--what other explanation could there be?\n\nThe first step, it was clear, was to purge the Church of her shames and\nher errors. The Reformers must be exposed; the yoke of the secular power\nmust be thrown off; dogma must be reinstated in its old pre-eminence;\nand Christians must be reminded of what they had apparently\nforgotten--the presence of the supernatural in daily life. 'It would be\na gain to this country,' Keble observed, 'were it vastly more\nsuperstitious, more bigoted, more gloomy, more fierce in its religion,\nthan at present it shows itself to be.' 'The only good I know of\nCranmer,' said Hurrell Froude, 'was that he burned well.' Newman\npreached, and soon the new views began to spread. Among the earliest of\nthe converts was Dr Pusey, a man of wealth and learning, a professor, a\ncanon of Christ Church, who had, it was rumoured, been to Germany. Then\nthe Tracts for the Times were started under Newman's editorship, and the\nMovement was launched upon the world.\n\nThe Tracts were written 'with the hope of rousing members of our Church\nto comprehend her alarming position ... as a man might give notice of a\nfire or inundation, to startle all who heard him'. They may be said to\nhave succeeded in their objective, for the sensation which they caused\namong clergymen throughout the country was extreme. They dealt with a\ngreat variety of questions, but the underlying intention of all of them\nwas to attack the accepted doctrines and practices of the Church of\nEngland. Dr. Pusey wrote learnedly on Baptismal Regeneration; he also\nwrote on Fasting. His treatment of the latter subject met with\nconsiderable disapproval, which surprised the Doctor. 'I was not\nprepared,' he said, 'for people questioning, even in the abstract, the\nduty of fasting; I thought serious-minded persons at least supposed they\npractised fasting in some way or other. I assumed the duty to be\nacknowledged and thought it only undervalued.' We live and learn, even\nthough we have been to Germany.\n\nOther tracts discussed the Holy Catholic Church, the Clergy, and the\nLiturgy. One treated of the question 'whether a clergyman of the Church\nof England be now bound to have morning and evening prayers daily in his\nparish church?' Another pointed out the 'Indications of a superintending\nProvidence in the preservation of the Prayer-book and in the changes\nwhich it has undergone'. Another consisted of a collection of 'Advent\nSermons on Antichrist'. Keble wrote a long and elaborate tract 'On the\nMysticism attributed to the Early Fathers of the Church', in which he\nexpressed his opinions upon a large number of curious matters.\n\n'According to men's usual way of talking,' he wrote, 'it would be called\nan accidental circumstance that there were five loaves, not more nor\nless, in the store of Our Lord and His disciples wherewith to provide\nthe miraculous feast. But the ancient interpreters treat it as designed\nand providential, in this surely not erring: and their conjecture is\nthat it represents the sacrifice of the whole world of sense, and\nespecially of the Old Dispensation, which, being outward and visible,\nmight be called the dispensation of the senses, to the FATHER of our\nLORD JESUS CHRIST, to be a pledge and means of communion with Him\naccording to the terms of the new or evangelical law.\n\nThey arrived at this idea by considering the number five, the number of\nthe senses, as the mystical opponent of the visible and sensible\nuniverse--ta aistheta, as distinguished from ta noita. Origen lays down\nthe rule in express terms. '\"The number five,\"' he says, '\"frequently,\nnay almost always, is taken for the five senses.\"' In another passage,\nKeble deals with an even more recondite question. He quotes the teaching\nof St. Barnabas that 'Abraham, who first gave men circumcision, did\nthereby perform a spiritual and typical action, looking forward to the\nSon'. St. Barnabas's argument is as follows: Abraham circumcised of his\nhouse men to the number of 318. Why 318? Observe first the 18, then the\n300. Of the two letters which stand for 18, 10 is represented by 1, 8 by\nH. 'Thou hast here,' says St. Barnabas, 'the word of Jesus.' As for the\n300, 'the Cross is represented by Tau, and the letter Tau represents\nthat number'.\n\nUnfortunately, however, St. Barnabas's premise was of doubtful validity,\nas the Rev. Mr. Maitland pointed out, in a pamphlet impugning the\nconclusions of the Tract. 'The simple fact is,' he wrote, 'that when\nAbraham pursued Chedorlaomer \"he armed his trained servants, BORN IN HIS\nOWN HOUSE, three hundred and eighteen\". When, more than thirteen\n(according to the common chronology, fifteen) years after, he\ncircumcised \"all the men of his house, BORN IN THE HOUSE, AND BOUGHT\nWITH MONEY OF THE STRANGER\", and, in fact, every male who was as much as\neight days old, we are not told what the number amounted to. Shall we\nsuppose (just for the sake of the interpretation) that Abraham's family\nhad so dwindled in the interval as that now all the males of his\nhousehold, trained men, slaves, and children, equalled only and exactly\nthe number of his warriors fifteen years before?'\n\nThe question seems difficult to answer, but Keble had, as a matter of\nfact, forestalled the argument in the following passage, which had\napparently escaped the notice of the Rev. Mr. Maitland:\n\n'Now whether the facts were really so or not (if it were, it was surely\nby special providence), that Abraham's household at the time of the\ncircumcision was exactly the same number as before; still the argument\nof St. Barnabas will stand. As thus: circumcision had from the\nbeginning, a reference to our SAVIOUR, as in other respects, so in this;\nthat the mystical number, which is the cipher of Jesus crucified, was\nthe number of the first circumcised household in the strength of which\nAbraham prevailed against the powers of the world. So St. Clement of\nAlexandria, as cited by Fell.'\n\nAnd Keble supports his contention through ten pages of close print, with\nreferences to Aristeas, St. Augustine, St. Jerome, and Dr. Whitby.\n\nWritings of this kind could not fail in their effect. Pious youths in\nOxford were carried away by them, and began to flock around the standard\nof Newman. Newman himself became a party chief--encouraging, organising,\npersuading. His long black figure, swiftly passing through the streets,\nwas pointed at with awe; crowds flocked to his sermons; his words were\nrepeated from mouth to mouth; 'Credo in Newmannum' became a common\ncatchword. Jokes were made about the Church of England, and practices,\nunknown for centuries, began to be revived. Young men fasted and did\npenance, recited the hours of the Roman Breviary, and confessed their\nsins to Dr. Pusey. Nor was the movement confined to Oxford; it spread in\nwidening circles through the parishes of England; the dormant devotion\nof the country was suddenly aroused. The new strange notion of taking\nChristianity literally was delightful to earnest minds; but it was also\nalarming. Really to mean every word you said, when you repeated the\nAthanasian Creed! How wonderful! And what enticing and mysterious vistas\nburst upon the view! But then, those vistas, where were they leading?\nSupposing--oh heavens!--supposing after all they were to lead to--!\n\n\nIII\n\nIN due course, the Tracts made their appearance at the remote rectory in\nSussex. Manning was some years younger than Newman, and the two men had\nonly met occasionally at the University; but now, through common\nfriends, a closer relationship began to grow up between them. It was\nonly to be expected that Newman should be anxious to enroll the rising\nyoung Rector among his followers; and, on Manning's side, there were\nmany causes which impelled him to accept the overtures from Oxford.\n\nHe was a man of a serious and vigorous temperament, to whom it was\ninevitable that the bold high principles of the Movement should strongly\nappeal. There was also an element in his mind that element which had\nterrified him in his childhood with Apocalyptic visions, and urged him\nin his youth to Bible readings after breakfast--which now brought him\nunder the spell of the Oxford theories of sacramental mysticism. And\nbesides, the Movement offered another attraction: it imputed an\nextraordinary, transcendent merit to the profession which Manning\nhimself pursued. The cleric was not as his lay brethren; he was a\ncreature apart, chosen by Divine will and sanctified by Divine\nmysteries. It was a relief to find, when one had supposed that one was\nnothing but a clergyman, that one might, after all, be something\nelse--one might be a priest.\n\nAccordingly, Manning shook off his early Evangelical convictions,\nstarted an active correspondence with Newman, and was soon working for\nthe new cause. He collected quotations, and began to translate the works\nof Optatus for Dr. Pusey. He wrote an article on Justin for the British\nCritic, \"Newman's Magazine\". He published a sermon on Faith, with notes\nand appendices, which was condemned by an evangelical bishop, and\nfiercely attacked by no less a person than the celebrated Mr. Bowdler.\n'The sermon,' said Mr Bowdler, in a book which he devoted to the\nsubject, 'was bad enough, but the appendix was abominable.' At the same\ntime he was busy asserting the independence of the Church of England,\nopposing secular education, and bringing out pamphlets against the\nEcclesiastical Commission, which had been appointed by Parliament to\nreport on Church Property. Then we find him in the role of a spiritual\ndirector of souls. Ladies met him by stealth in his church, and made\ntheir confessions. Over one case--that of a lady, who found herself\ndrifting towards Rome--he consulted Newman. Newman advised him to\n'enlarge upon the doctrine of I Cor. vii';\n\n'also, I think you must press on her the prospect of benefiting the poor\nChurch, through which she has her baptism, by stopping in it. Does she\nnot care for the souls of all around her, steeped and stifled in\nProtestantism? How will she best care for them by indulging her own\nfeelings in the communion of Rome, or in denying herself, and staying in\nsackcloth and ashes to do them good?'\n\nWhether these arguments were successful does not appear.\n\nFor several years after his wife's death, Manning was occupied with\nthese new activities, while his relations with Newman developed into\nwhat was apparently a warm friendship. 'And now vive valeque, my dear\nManning', we find Newman writing in a letter dated 'in festo S. Car.\n1838', 'as wishes and prays yours affectionately, John H. Newman'. But,\nas time went on, the situation became more complicated. Tractarianism\nbegan to arouse the hostility, not only of the evangelical, but of the\nmoderate churchmen, who could not help perceiving in the ever-deepening,\n'catholicism' of the Oxford party, the dread approaches of Rome. The\n\"Record\" newspaper an influential Evangelical journal--took up the\nmatter and sniffed Popery in every direction; it spoke of certain\nclergymen as 'tainted'; and after that, preferment seemed to pass those\nclergymen by. The fact that Manning found it wise to conduct his\nconfessional ministrations in secret was in itself highly significant.\nIt was necessary to be careful, and Manning was very careful indeed. The\nneighbouring Archdeacon, Mr. Hare, was a low churchman; Manning made\nfriends with him, as warmly, it seemed, as he had made friends with\nNewman. He corresponded with him, asked his advice about the books he\nshould read, and discussed questions of Theology--'As to Gal. vi 15, we\ncannot differ.... With a man who reads and reasons I can have no\ncontroversy; and you do both.' Archdeacon Hare was pleased, but soon a\nrumour reached him, which was, to say the least of it, upsetting.\nManning had been removing the high pews from a church in Brighton, and\nputting in open benches in their place. Everyone knew what that meant;\neveryone knew that a high pew was one of the bulwarks of Protestantism,\nand that an open bench had upon it the taint of Rome. But Manning\nhastened to explain:\n\n'My dear friend,' he wrote, 'I did not exchange pews for open benches,\nbut got the pews (the same in number) moved from the nave of the church\nto the walls of the side aisles, so that the whole church has a regular\narrangement of open benches, which (irregularly) existed before ... I am\nnot today quite well, so farewell, with much regard--Yours ever, H. E.\nM.'\n\nArchdeacon Hare was reassured.\n\nIt was important that he should be, for the Archdeacon of Chichester was\ngrowing very old, and Hare's influence might be exceedingly useful when\na vacancy occurred. So, indeed, it fell out. A new bishop, Dr.\nShuttleworth, was appointed to the See, and the old Archdeacon took the\nopportunity of retiring. Manning was obviously marked out as his\nsuccessor, but the new bishop happened to be a low churchman, an\naggressive low churchman, who went so far as to parody the Tractarian\nfashion of using Saints' days for the dating of letters by writing 'The\nPalace, washing-day', at the beginning of his. And--what was equally\nserious--his views were shared by Mrs. Shuttleworth, who had already\ndecided that the pushing young Rector was 'tainted'. But at the critical\nmoment Archdeacon Hare came to the rescue; he persuaded the Bishop that\nManning was safe; and the appointment was accordingly made--behind Mrs.\nShuttleworth's back. She was furious, but it was too late; Manning was\nan Archdeacon. All the lady could do, to indicate her disapprobation,\nwas to put a copy of Mr. Bowdler's book in a conspicuous position on the\ndrawing-room table, when he came to pay his respects at the Palace.\n\nAmong the letters of congratulation which Manning received, was one from\nMr Gladstone, with whom he had remained on terms of close friendship\nsince their days together at Oxford.\n\n'I rejoice,' Mr Gladstone wrote, 'on your account personally; but more\nfor the sake of the Church. All my brothers-in-law are here and scarcely\nless delighted than I am. With great glee am I about to write your new\naddress; but, the occasion really calls for higher sentiments; and sure\nam I that you are one of the men to whom it is specially given to\ndevelop the solution of that great problem--how all our minor\ndistractions are to be either abandoned, absorbed, or harmonised through\nthe might of the great principle of communion in the body of Christ.'\n\nManning was an Archdeacon; but he was not yet out of the woods. His\nrelations with the Tractarians had leaked out, and the Record was\nbeginning to be suspicious. If Mrs. Shuttleworth's opinion of him were\nto become general, it would certainly be a grave matter. Nobody could\nwish to live and die a mere Archdeacon. And then, at that very moment,\nan event occurred which made it imperative to take a definite step, one\nway or the other. That event was the publication of Tract No. 90.\n\nFor some time it had been obvious to every impartial onlooker that\nNewman was slipping down an inclined plane at the bottom of which lay\none thing, and one thing only--the Roman Catholic Church. What was\nsurprising was the length of time which he was taking to reach the\ninevitable destination. Years passed before he came to realise that his\ngrandiose edifice of a Church Universal would crumble to pieces if one\nof its foundation stones was to be an amatory intrigue of Henry VIII.\nBut, at last he began to see that terrible monarch glowering at him\nwherever he turned his eyes. First he tried to exorcise the spectre with\nthe rolling periods of the Caroline divines; but it only strutted the\nmore truculently. Then in despair he plunged into the writings of the\nearly Fathers, and sought to discover some way out of his difficulties\nin the complicated labyrinth of ecclesiastical history. After months\nspent in the study of the Monophysite heresy, the alarming conclusion\nbegan to force itself upon him that the Church of England was perhaps in\nschism. Eventually he read an article by a Roman Catholic on St.\nAugustine and the Donatists, which seemed to put the matter beyond\ndoubt. St. Augustine, in the fifth century, had pointed out that the\nDonatists were heretics because the Bishop of Rome had said so. The\nargument was crushing; it rang in Newman's ears for days and nights;\nand, though he continued to linger on in agony for six years more, he\nnever could discover any reply to it. All he could hope to do was to\npersuade himself and anyone else who liked to listen to him that the\nholding of Anglican orders was not inconsistent with a belief in the\nwhole cycle of Roman doctrine as laid down at the Council of Trent. In\nthis way he supposed that he could at once avoid the deadly sin of\nheresy and conscientiously remain a clergyman in the Church of England;\nand with this end in view, he composed Tract No. 90.\n\nThe object of the Tract was to prove that there was nothing in the\nThirty-nine Articles incompatible with the creed of the Roman Church.\nNewman pointed out, for instance, that it was generally supposed that\nthe Articles condemned the doctrine of Purgatory; but they did not; they\nmerely condemned the Romish doctrine of Purgatory--and Romish, clearly,\nwas not the same thing as Roman. Hence it followed that believers in the\nRoman doctrine of Purgatory might subscribe the Articles with a good\nconscience. Similarly, the Articles condemned 'the sacrifices of\nmasses', but they did not condemn 'the sacrifice of the Mass'. Thus, the\nMass might be lawfully celebrated in English Churches. Newman took the\ntrouble to examine the Articles in detail from this point of view, and\nthe conclusion he came to in every case supported his contention in a\nsingular manner.\n\nThe Tract produced an immense sensation, for it seemed to be a deadly\nand treacherous blow aimed at the very heart of the Church of England.\nDeadly it certainly was, but it was not so treacherous as it appeared at\nfirst sight. The members of the English Church had ingenuously imagined\nup to that moment that it was possible to contain, in a frame of words,\nthe subtle essence of their complicated doctrinal system, involving the\nmysteries of the Eternal and the Infinite on the one hand, and the\nelaborate adjustments of temporal government on the other. They did not\nunderstand that verbal definitions in such a case will only perform\ntheir functions so long as there is no dispute about the matters which\nthey are intended to define: that is to say, so long as there is no need\nfor them. For generations this had been the case with the Thirty-nine\nArticles. Their drift was clear enough; and nobody bothered over their\nexact meaning. But directly someone found it important to give them a\nnew and untraditional interpretation, it appeared that they were a mass\nof ambiguity, and might be twisted into meaning very nearly anything\nthat anybody liked. Steady-going churchmen were appalled and outraged\nwhen they saw Newman, in Tract No. 90, performing this operation. But,\nafter all, he was only taking the Church of England at its word. And\nindeed, since Newman showed the way, the operation has become so\nexceedingly common that the most steady-going churchman hardly raises an\neyebrow at it now.\n\nAt the time, however, Newman's treatment of the Articles seemed to\ndisplay not only a perverted supersubtlety of intellect, but a temper of\nmind that was fundamentally dishonest. It was then that he first began\nto be assailed by those charges of untruthfulness which reached their\nculmination more than twenty years later in the celebrated controversy\nwith Charles Kingsley, which led to the writing of the Apologia. The\ncontroversy was not a very fruitful one, chiefly because Kingsley could\nno more understand the nature of Newman's intelligence than a subaltern\nin a line regiment can understand a Brahmin of Benares. Kingsley was a\nstout Protestant, whose hatred of Popery was, at bottom, simply\nethical--an honest, instinctive horror of the practices of priestcraft\nand the habits of superstition; and it was only natural that he should\nsee in those innumerable delicate distinctions which Newman was\nperpetually drawing, and which he himself had not only never thought of,\nbut could not even grasp, simply another manifestation of the inherent\nfalsehood of Rome. But, in reality, no one, in one sense of the word,\nwas more truthful than Newman. The idea of deceit would have been\nabhorrent to him; and indeed it was owing to his very desire to explain\nwhat he had in his mind exactly and completely, with all the refinements\nof which his subtle brain was capable, that persons such as Kingsley\nwere puzzled into thinking him dishonest. Unfortunately, however, the\npossibilities of truth and falsehood depend upon other things besides\nsincerity. A man may be of a scrupulous and impeccable honesty, and yet\nhis respect for the truth--it cannot be denied--may be insufficient. He\nmay be, like the lunatic, the lover, and the poet, 'of imagination all\ncompact'; he may be blessed, or cursed, with one of those 'seething\nbrains', one of those 'shaping fanatasies' that 'apprehend more than\ncool reason ever comprehends'; he may be by nature incapable of sifting\nevidence, or by predilection simply indisposed to do so. 'When we were\nthere,' wrote Newman in a letter to a friend after his conversion,\ndescribing a visit to Naples, and the miraculous circumstances connected\nwith the liquefaction of St. Januarius's blood,\n\n'the feast of St. Gennaro was coming on, and the Jesuits were eager for\nus to stop--they have the utmost confidence in the miracle--and were the\nmore eager because many Catholics, till they have seen it, doubt it. Our\nfather director here tells us that before he went to Naples he did not\nbelieve it. That is, they have vague ideas of natural means,\nexaggeration, etc., not of course imputing fraud. They say conversions\noften take place in consequence. It is exposed for the Octave, and the\nmiracle continues--it is not simple liquefaction, but sometimes it\nswells, sometimes boils, sometimes melts--no one can tell what is going\nto take place. They say it is quite overcoming-and people cannot help\ncrying to see it. I understand that Sir H. Davy attended everyday, and\nit was this extreme variety of the phenomenon which convinced him that\nnothing physical would account for it. Yet there is this remarkable fact\nthat liquefactions of blood are common at Naples--and, unless it is\nirreverent to the Great Author of Miracles to be obstinate in the\ninquiry, the question certainly rises whether there is something in the\nair. (Mind, I don't believe there is--and, speaking humbly, and without\nhaving seen it, think it a true miracle--but I am arguing.) We saw the\nblood of St Patrizia, half liquid; i.e. liquefying, on her feast day. St\nJohn Baptist's blood sometimes liquefies on the 29th of August, and did\nwhen we were at Naples, but we had not time to go to the church. We saw\nthe liquid blood of an Oratorian Father; a good man, but not a saint,\nwho died two centuries ago, I think; and we saw the liquid blood of Da\nPonte, the great and holy Jesuit, who, I suppose, was almost a saint.\nBut these instances do not account for liquefaction on certain days, if\nthis is the case. But the most strange phenomenon is what happens at\nRavello, a village or town above Amalfi. There is the blood of St.\nPantaleon. It is in a vessel amid the stonework of the Altar-it is not\ntouched but on his feast in June it liquefies. And more, there is an\nexcommunication against those who bring portions of the True Cross into\nthe Church. Why? Because the blood liquefies, whenever it is brought. A\nperson I know, not knowing the prohibition, brought in a portion, and\nthe Priest suddenly said, who showed the blood, \"Who has got the Holy\nCross about him?\" I tell you what was told me by a grave and religious\nman. It is a curious coincidence that in telling this to our Father\nDirector here, he said, \"Why, we have a portion of St. Pantaleon's blood\nat the Chiesa Nuova, and it is always liquid.\"'\n\nAfter leaving Naples, Newman visited Loreto, and inspected the house of\nthe Holy Family, which, as is known to the faithful, was transported\nthither, in three hops, from Palestine.\n\n'I went to Loreto,' he wrote, 'with a simple faith, believing what I\nstill more believed when I saw it. I have no doubt now. If you ask me\nwhy I believe it, it is because everyone believes it at Rome; cautious\nas they are and sceptical about some other things. I have no antecedent\ndifficulty in the matter. He who floated the Ark on the surges of a\nworld-wide sea, and enclosed in it all living things, who has hidden the\nterrestrial paradise, who said that faith might move mountains, who\nsustained thousands for forty years in a sterile wilderness, who\ntransported Elias and keeps him hidden till the end, could do this\nwonder also.'\n\nHere, whatever else there may be, there is certainly no trace of a\ndesire to deceive. Could a state of mind, in fact, be revealed with more\nabsolute transparency?\n\nWhen Newman was a child he 'wished that he could believe the Arabian\nNights were true'. When he came to be a man, his wish seems to have been\ngranted.\n\nTract No. 90 was officially condemned by the authorities at Oxford, and\nin the hubbub that followed, the contending parties closed their ranks;\nhenceforward, any compromise between the friends and the enemies of the\nMovement was impossible. Archdeacon Manning was in too conspicuous a\nposition to be able to remain silent; he was obliged to declare himself,\nand he did not hesitate. In an archidiaconal charge, delivered within a\nfew months of his appointment, he firmly repudiated the Tractarians. But\nthe repudiation was not deemed sufficient, and a year later he repeated\nit with greater emphasis. Still, however, the horrid rumours were\nafloat. The \"Record\" began to investigate matters, and its vigilance was\nsoon rewarded by an alarming discovery: the sacrament had been\nadministered in Chichester Cathedral on a weekday, and 'Archdeacon\nManning, one of the most noted and determined of the Tractarians, had\nacted a conspicuous part on the occasion'. It was clear that the only\nway of silencing these malevolent whispers was by some public\ndemonstration whose import nobody could doubt. The annual sermon\npreached on Guy Fawkes Day before the University of Oxford seemed to\noffer the very opportunity that Manning required. He seized it; got\nhimself appointed preacher; and delivered from the pulpit of St. Mary's\na virulently Protestant harangue. This time there could indeed be no\ndoubt about the matter: Manning had shouted 'No Popery!' in the very\ncitadel of the Movement, and every one, including Newman, recognised\nthat he had finally cut himself off from his old friends. Everyone, that\nis to say, except the Archdeacon himself. On the day after the sermon,\nManning walked out to the neighbouring village of Littlemore, where\nNewman was now living in retirement with a few chosen disciples, in the\nhope of being able to give a satisfactory explanation of what he had\ndone. But he was disappointed; for when, after an awkward interval, one\nof the disciples appeared at the door, he was informed that Mr. Newman\nwas not at home.\n\nWith his retirement to Littlemore, Newman had entered upon the final\nperiod of his Anglican career. Even he could no longer help perceiving\nthat the end was now only a matter of time. His progress was hastened in\nan agitating manner by the indiscreet activity of one of his proselytes,\nW. G. Ward. a young man who combined an extraordinary aptitude for a\npriori reasoning with a passionate devotion to Opera Bouffe. It was\ndifficult, in fact, to decide whether the inner nature of Ward was more\ntruly expressing itself when he was firing off some train of scholastic\nparadoxes on the Eucharist or when he was trilling the airs of Figaro\nand plunging through the hilarious roulades of the Largo al Factotum.\nEven Dr. Pusey could not be quite sure, though he was Ward's spiritual\ndirector. On one occasion his young penitent came to him, and confessed\nthat a vow which he had taken to abstain from music during Lent was\nbeginning to affect his health. Could Dr. Pusey see his way to releasing\nhim from the vow? The Doctor decided that a little sacred music would\nnot be amiss. Ward was all gratitude, and that night a party was\narranged in a friend's rooms. The concert began with the solemn\nharmonies of Handel, which were followed by the holy strains of the 'Oh\nSalutaris' of Cherubini. Then came the elevation and the pomp of\n'Possenti Numi' from the Magic Flute. But, alas! there lies much danger\nin Mozart. The page was turned and there was the delicious duet between\nPapageno and Papagena. Flesh and blood could not resist that; then song\nfollowed song, the music waxed faster and lighter, until, at last Ward\nburst into the intoxicating merriment of the Largo al Factotum. When it\nwas over, a faint but persistent knocking made itself heard upon the\nwall; and it was only then that the company remembered that the rooms\nnext door were Dr. Pusey's.\n\nThe same entrainment which carried Ward away when he sat down to a piano\npossessed him whenever he embarked on a religious discussion. 'The thing\nthat was utterly abhorrent to him,' said one of his friends, 'was to\nstop short.' Given the premises, he would follow out their implications\nwith the mercilessness of a medieval monk, and when he had reached the\nlast limits of argument, be ready to maintain whatever propositions he\nmight find there with his dying breath. He had the extreme innocence of\na child and a mathematician. Captivated by the glittering eye of Newman,\nhe swallowed whole the supernatural conception of the universe which\nNewman had evolved, accepted it as a fundamental premise, and 'began at\nonce to deduce from it whatsoever there might be to be deduced.' His\nvery first deductions included irrefutable proofs of (I) God's\nparticular providence for individuals; (2) the real efficacy of\nintercessory prayer; (3) the reality of our communion with the saints\ndeparted; (4) the constant presence and assistance of the angels of God.\nLater on he explained mathematically the importance of the Ember Days:\n'Who can tell,' he added, 'the degree of blessing lost to us in this\nland by neglecting, as we alone of Christian Churches do neglect, these\nholy days?' He then proceeded to convict the Reformers, not only of\nrebellion, but'--for my own part I see not how we can avoid adding--of\nperjury.' Every day his arguments became more extreme, more rigorously\nexact, and more distressing to his master. Newman was in the position of\na cautious commander-in-chief being hurried into an engagement against\nhis will by a dashing cavalry officer. Ward forced him forward step by\nstep towards-no! he could not bear it; he shuddered and drew back. But\nit was of no avail. In vain did Keble and Pusey wring their hands and\nstretch forth their pleading arms to their now vanishing brother. The\nfatal moment was fast approaching. Ward at last published a devastating\nbook in which he proved conclusively, by a series of syllogisms, that\nthe only proper course for the Church of England was to repent in\nsackcloth and ashes her separation from the Communion of Rome. The\nreckless author was deprived of his degree by an outraged University,\nand a few weeks later was received into the Catholic Church.\n\nNewman, in a kind of despair, had flung himself into the labours of\nhistorical compilation. His views of history had changed since the days\nwhen, as an undergraduate, he had feasted on the worldly pages of\nGibbon.\n\n'Revealed religion,' he now thought, 'furnishes facts to other sciences,\nwhich those sciences, left to themselves, would never reach. Thus, in\nthe science of history, the preservation of our race in Noah's Ark is an\nhistorical fact, which history never would arrive at without\nrevelation.'\n\nWith these principles to guide him, he plunged with his disciples into a\nprolonged study of the English Saints. Biographies soon appeared of St.\nBega, St. Adamnan, St. Gundleus, St. Guthlake, Brother Drithelm, St.\nAmphibalus, St. Wuistan, St. Ebba, St. Neot, St. Ninian, and Cunibert\nthe Hermit. Their austerities, their virginity, and their miraculous\npowers were described in detail. The public learned with astonishment\nthat St Ninian had turned a staff into a tree; that St. German had\nstopped a cock from crowing, and that a child had been raised from the\ndead to convert St. Helier. The series has subsequently been continued\nby a more modern writer whose relation of the history of the blessed St.\nMael contains, perhaps, even more matter for edification than Newman's\nbiographies.\n\nAt the time, indeed, those works caused considerable scandal. Clergymen\ndenounced them in pamphlets. St. Cuthbert was described by his\nbiographer as having 'carried the jealousy of women, characteristic of\nall the saints, to an extraordinary pitch'. An example was given,\nwhenever he held a spiritual conversation with St Ebba, he was careful\nto spend the ensuing ours of darkness 'in prayer, up to his neck in\nwater'. 'Persons who invent such tales,' wrote one indignant\ncommentator, 'cast very grave and just suspicions on the purity of their\nown minds. And young persons, who talk and think in this way, are in\nextreme danger of falling into sinful habits. As to the volumes before\nus, the authors have, in their fanatical panegyrics of virginity, made\nuse of language downright profane.'\n\nOne of the disciples at Littlemore was James Anthony Froude, the younger\nbrother of Hurrell, and it fell to his lot to be responsible for the\nbiography of St. Neot. While he was composing it, he began to feel some\nqualms. Saints who lighted fires with icicles, changed bandits into\nwolves, and floated across the Irish Channel on altar-stones, produced a\ndisturbing effect on his historical conscience. But he had promised his\nservices to Newman, and he determined to carry through the work in the\nspirit in which he had begun it. He did so; but he thought it proper to\nadd the following sentence by way of conclusion: 'This is all, and\nindeed rather more than all, that is known to men of the blessed St.\nNeot; but not more than is known to the angels in heaven.'\n\nMeanwhile, the English Roman Catholics were growing impatient; was the\ngreat conversion never coming, for which they had prayed so fervently\nand so long? Dr. Wiseman, at the head of them, was watching and waiting\nwith special eagerness. His hand was held out under the ripening fruit;\nthe delicious morsel seemed to be trembling on its stalk; and yet it did\nnot fall. At last, unable to bear the suspense any longer, he dispatched\nto Littlemore Father Smith, an old pupil of Newman's, who had lately\njoined the Roman communion, with instructions that he should do his\nbest, under cover of a simple visit of friendship, to discover how the\nland lay. Father Smith was received somewhat coldly, and the\nconversation ran entirely on topics which had nothing to do with\nreligion. When the company separated before dinner, he was beginning to\nthink that his errand had been useless; but, on their reassembling, he\nsuddenly noticed that Newman had changed his trousers, and that the\ncolour of the pair which he was now wearing was grey. At the earliest\nmoment, the emissary rushed back post-haste to Dr. Wiseman. 'All is\nwell,' he exclaimed; 'Newman no longer considers that he is in Anglican\norders.\" Praise be to God!' answered Dr Wiseman. 'But how do you know?'\nFather Smith described what he had seen. 'Oh, is that all? My dear\nfather, how can you be so foolish?' But Father Smith was not to be\nshaken. 'I know the man,' he said, and I know what it means. 'Newman will\ncome, and he will come soon.'\n\nAnd Father Smith was right. A few weeks later, Newman suddenly slipped\noff to a priest, and all was over. Perhaps he would have hesitated\nlonger still, if he could have foreseen how he was to pass the next\nthirty years of his unfortunate existence; but the future was hidden,\nand all that was certain was that the past had gone forever, and that\nhis eyes would rest no more upon the snapdragons of Trinity.\n\nThe Oxford Movement was now ended. The University breathed such a sigh\nof relief as usually follows the difficult expulsion of a hard piece of\nmatter from a living organism, and actually began to attend to\neducation. As for the Church of England, she had tasted blood, and it\nwas clear that she would never again be content with a vegetable diet.\nHer clergy, however, maintained their reputation for judicious\ncompromise, for they followed Newman up to the very point beyond which\nhis conclusions were logical, and, while they intoned, confessed, swung\nincense, and burned candles with the exhilaration of converts, they yet\nmanaged to do so with a subtle nuance which showed that they had nothing\nto do with Rome. Various individuals underwent more violent changes.\nSeveral had preceded Newman into the Roman fold; among others an unhappy\nMr. Sibthorpe, who subsequently changed his mind, and returned to the\nChurch of his fathers, and then--perhaps it was only natural--changed\nhis mind again. Many more followed Newman, and Dr. Wiseman was\nparticularly pleased by the conversion of a Mr. Morris, who, as he said,\nwas 'the author of the essay, which won the prize on the best method of\nproving Christianity to the Hindus'. Hurrell Froude had died before\nNewman had read the fatal article on St. Augustine; but his brother,\nJames Anthony, together with Arthur Clough, the poet, went through an\nexperience which was more distressing in those days than it has since\nbecome; they lost their faith. With this difference, however, that while\nin Froude's case the loss of his faith turned out to be rather like the\nloss of a heavy portmanteau, which one afterwards discovers to have been\nfull of old rags and brickbats, Clough was made so uneasy by the loss of\nhis that he went on looking for it everywhere as long as he lived; but\nsomehow he never could find it. On the other hand, Keble and Pusey\ncontinued for the rest of their lives to dance in an exemplary manner\nupon the tight-rope of High Anglicanism; in such an exemplary manner,\nindeed, that the tight-rope has its dancers still.\n\n\nIV\n\nMANNING was now thirty-eight, and it was clear that he was the rising\nman in the Church of England. He had many powerful connections: he was\nthe brother-in-law of Samuel Wilberforce, who had been lately made a\nbishop; he was a close friend of Mr. Gladstone, who was a Cabinet\nMinister; and he was becoming well known in the influential circles of\nsociety in London. His talent for affairs was recognised not only in the\nChurch, but in the world at large, and he busied himself with matters of\nsuch varied scope as National Education, the administration of the Poor\nLaw, and the Employment of Women. Mr. Gladstone kept up an intimate\ncorrespondence with him on these and on other subjects, mingling in his\nletters the details of practical statesmanship with the speculations of\na religious thinker. 'Sir James Graham,' he wrote, in a discussion of\nthe bastardy clauses of the Poor Law, 'is much pleased with the tone of\nyour two communications. He is disposed, without putting an end to the\napplication of the workhouse test against the mother, to make the remedy\nagainst the putative father \"real and effective\" for expenses incurred\nin the workhouse. I am not enough acquainted to know whether it would be\nadvisable to go further. You have not proposed it; and I am disposed to\nbelieve that only with a revived and improved discipline in the Church\ncan we hope for any generally effective check upon lawless lust.' 'I\nagree with you EMINENTLY,' he writes, in a later letter, 'in your\ndoctrine of FILTRATION. But it sometimes occurs to me, though the\nquestion may seem a strange one, how far was the Reformation, but\nespecially the Continental Reformation, designed by God, in the region\nof final causes, for that purification of the Roman Church which it has\nactually realised?'\n\nIn his archdeaconry, Manning lived to the full the active life of a\ncountry clergyman. His slim, athletic figure was seen everywhere in the\nstreets of Chichester, or on the lawns of the neighbouring rectories, or\ngalloping over the downs in breeches and gaiters, or cutting brilliant\nfigures on the ice. He was an excellent judge of horse-flesh, and the\npair of greys which drew his hooded phaeton so swiftly through the lanes\nwere the admiration of the county. His features were already beginning\nto assume their ascetic cast, but the spirit of youth had not yet fled\nfrom them, so that he seemed to combine the attractions of dignity and\ngrace. He was a good talker, a sympathetic listener, a man who\nunderstood the difficult art of preserving all the vigour of a manly\ncharacter and yet never giving offence. No wonder that his sermons drew\ncrowds, no wonder that his spiritual advice was sought for eagerly by an\never-growing group of penitents; no wonder that men would say, when his\nname was mentioned, 'Oh, Manning! No power on earth can keep HIM from a\nbishopric!'\n\nSuch was the fair outward seeming of the Archdeacon's life; but, the\ninward reality was different. The more active, the more fortunate, the\nmore full of happy promise his existence became, the more persistently\nwas his secret imagination haunted by a dreadful vision--the lake that\nburneth forever with brimstone and fire. The temptations of the Evil One\nare many, Manning knew; and he knew also that, for him at least, the\nmost subtle and terrible of all temptations was the temptation of\nworldly success. He tried to reassure himself, but it was in vain. He\ncommitted his thoughts to a diary, weighing scrupulously his every\nmotive, examining with relentless searchings into the depths of his\nheart. Perhaps, after all, his longings for preferment were merely\nlegitimatehopes for 'an elevation into a sphere of higher usefulness'.\nBut no, there was something more than that. 'I do feel pleasure,' he\nnoted, 'in honour, precedence, elevation, the society of great people,\nand all this is very shameful and mean.'\n\nAfter Newman's conversion, he almost convinced himself that his 'visions\nof an ecclesiastical future' were justified by the role that he would\nplay as a 'healer of the breach in the Church of England'. Mr. Gladstone\nagreed with him; but there was One higher than Mr. Gladstone, and did He\nagree?\n\n'I am pierced by anxious thoughts. God knows what my desires have been\nand are, and why they are crossed.... I am flattering myself with a\nfancy about depth and reality.... The great question is: Is God enough\nfor you now? And if you are as now even to the end of life, will it\nsuffice you?... Certainly I would rather choose to be stayed on God,\nthan to be in the thrones of the world and the Church. Nothing else will\ngo into Eternity.'\n\nIn a moment of ambition, he had applied for the Readership of Lincoln's\nInn, but, owing chiefly to the hostile influence of the Record, the\nappointment had gone elsewhere. A little later, a more important\nposition was offered to him--the office of sub-almoner to the Queen,\nwhich had just been vacated by the Archbishop of York, and was almost\ncertain to lead to a mitre. The offer threw Manning into an agony of\nself-examination. He drew up elaborate tables, after the manner of\nRobinson Crusoe, with the reasons for and against his acceptance of the\npost:\n\n               FOR                      AGAINST\n\n    1. That it comes unsought.  1. Not therefore to be accepted. Such\n                                  things are trials as well as leadings.\n\n    2. That it is honourable.   2. Being what I am, ought I\n                                   not therefore to decline it--\n                                  (1) as humiliation;\n                                  (2) as revenge on myself\n                                      for Lincoln's Inn;\n\n                                  (3) as a testimony?\n\nAnd so on. He found in the end ten 'negative reasons', with no\naffirmative ones to balance them, and, after a week's deliberation, he\nrejected the offer.\n\nBut peace of mind was as far off from him as ever. First the bitter\nthought came to him that 'in all this Satan tells me I am doing it to be\nthought mortified and holy'; and then he was obsessed by the still\nbitterer feelings of ineradicable disappointment and regret. He had lost\na great opportunity, and it brought him small comfort to consider that\n'in the region of counsels, self-chastisement, humiliation,\nself-discipline, penance, and of the Cross', he had perhaps done right.\n\nThe crisis passed, but it was succeeded by a fiercer one. Manning was\ntaken seriously ill, and became convinced that he might die at any\nmoment. The entries in his Diary grew more elaborate than ever; his\nremorse for the past, his resolutions for the future, his protestations\nof submission to the will of God, filled page after page of parallel\ncolumns, headings and sub-headings, numbered clauses, and analytical\ntables. 'How do I feel about Death?' he wrote.\n\n    'Certainly great fear:\n\n    1. Because of the uncertainty of our state before God.\n    2. Because of the consciousness--\n       (1) of great sins past,\n       (2) of great sinfulness,\n       (3) of most shallow repentance.\n\n    What shall I do?'\n\nHe decided to mortify himself, to read St Thomas Aquinas, and to make\nhis 'night prayers forty instead of thirty minutes'. He determined\nduring Lent 'to use no pleasant bread (except on Sundays and feasts)\nsuch as cake and sweetmeat'; but he added the proviso 'I do not include\nplain biscuits'. Opposite this entry appears the word 'KEPT'. And yet\nhis back-slidings were many. Looking back over a single week, he was\nobliged to register 'petulance twice' and 'complacent visions'. He heard\nhis curate being commended for bringing so many souls to God during\nLent, and he 'could not bear it'; but the remorse was terrible: 'I\nabhorred myself on the spot, and looked upward for help.' He made out\nlist upon list of the Almighty's special mercies towards him, and they\nincluded his creation, his regeneration, and (No. 5) 'the preservation\nof my life six times to my knowledge:\n\n    (1) In illness at the age of nine.\n    (2) In the water.\n    (3) By a runaway horse at Oxford.\n    (4) By the same.\n    (5) By falling nearly through the ceiling of a church.\n    (6) Again by a fall of a horse. And I know not\n        how often in shooting, riding, etc.'\n\nAt last he became convalescent; but the spiritual experiences of those\nagitated weeks left an indelible mark upon his mind, and prepared the\nway for the great change which was to follow.\n\nFor he had other doubts besides those which held him in torment as to\nhis own salvation; he was in doubt about the whole framework of his\nfaith. Newman's conversion, he found, had meant something more to him\nthan he had first realised. It had seemed to come as a call to the\nredoubling of his Anglican activities; but supposing, in reality, it\nwere a call towards something very different--towards an abandonment of\nthose activities altogether? It might be 'a trial', or again it might be\na 'leading'; how was he to judge? Already, before his illness, these\ndoubts had begun to take possession of his mind.\n\n'I am conscious to myself,' he wrote in his Diary, 'of an extensively\nchanged feeling towards the Church of Rome ... The Church of England\nseems to me to be diseased: 1. ORGANICALLY (six sub-headings). 2.\nFUNCTIONALLY (seven sub-headings) ... Wherever it seems healthy, it\napproximates the system of Rome.'\n\nThen thoughts of the Virgin Mary suddenly began to assail him:\n\n    (1) If John the Baptist were sanctified from the womb,\n        how much more the B.V.!\n\n    (2) If Enoch and Elijah were exempted from death,\n        why not the B.V. from sin?\n\n    (3) It is a strange way of loving the Son to slight\n        the mother!'\n\nThe arguments seemed irresistible, and a few weeks later the following\nentry occurs--'Strange thoughts have visited me:\n\n    (1) I have felt that the Episcopate of the Church of England is\n        secularised and bound down beyond hope....\n\n    (2) I feel as if a light had fallen upon me. My feeling about the\n        Roman Church is not intellectual. I have intellectual\n        difficulties, but the great moral difficulties seem melting.\n\n    (3) Something keeps rising and saying, \"You will end in the Roman\n        Church\".\n\nHe noted altogether twenty-five of these 'strange thoughts'. His mind\nhovered anxiously round--\n\n    (1) The Incarnation,\n    (2) The Real Presence,\n           i. Regeneration,\n          ii. Eucharist, and\n    (3) The Exaltation of S. M. and Saints.\n\nHis twenty-second strange thought was as follows: 'How do I know where I\nmay be two years hence? Where was Newman five years ago?'\n\nIt was significant, but hardly surprising, that, after his illness,\nManning should have chosen to recuperate in Rome. He spent several\nmonths there, and his Diary during the whole of that period is concerned\nentirely with detailed descriptions of churches, ceremonies, and relics,\nand with minute accounts of conversations with priests and nuns. There\nis not a single reference either to the objects of art or to the\nantiquities of the place; but another omission was still more\nremarkable. Manning had a long interview with Pius IX, and his only\nrecord of it is contained in the bald statement: 'Audience today at the\nVatican'. Precisely what passed on that occasion never transpired; all\nthat is known is that His Holiness expressed considerable surprise on\nlearning from the Archdeacon that the chalice was used in the Anglican\nChurch in the administration of Communion. 'What!' he exclaimed, is the\nsame chalice made use of by everyone?' 'I remember the pain I felt,'\nsaid Manning, long afterwards, 'at seeing how unknown we were to the\nVicar of Jesus Christ. It made me feel our isolation.'\n\nOn his return to England, he took up once more the work in his\nArchdeaconry with what appetite he might. Ravaged by doubt, distracted\nby speculation, he yet managed to maintain an outward presence of\nunshaken calm. His only confidant was Robert Wilberforce, to whom, for\nthe next two years, he poured forth in a series of letters, headed\n'UNDER THE SEAL' to indicate that they contained the secrets of the\nconfessional--the whole history of his spiritual perturbations. The\nirony of his position was singular; for, during the whole of this time,\nManning was himself holding back from the Church of Rome a host of\nhesitating penitents by means of arguments which he was at the very\nmoment denouncing as fallacious to his own confessor. But what else\ncould he do? When he received, for instance, a letter such as the\nfollowing from an agitated lady, what was he to say?\n\n'MY DEAR FATHER IN CHRIST,\n\n' ... I am sure you would pity me and like to help me, if you knew the\nunhappy, unsettled state my mind is in, and the misery of being\nENTIRELY, WHEREVER I AM, with those who look upon joining the Church of\nRome as the most awful \"fall\" conceivable to any one, and are devoid of\nthe smallest comprehension of how any enlightened person can do it....\nMy old Evangelical friends, with all my deep, deep love for them, do not\nsucceed in shaking me in the least....\n\n'My brother has just published a book called \"Regeneration\", which all\nmy friends are reading and highly extolling; it has a very contrary\neffect to what he would desire on my mind. I can read and understand it\nall in an altogether different sense, and the facts which he quotes\nabout the articles as drawn up in 1536, and again in 1552, and of the\nIrish articles of 1615 and 1634, STARTLE and SHAKE me about the Reformed\nChurch in England far more than anything else, and have done so ever\nsince I first saw them in Mr. Maskell's pamphlet (as quoted from Mr\nDodsworth's).\n\n'I do hope you have some time and thought to pray for me still. Mr.\nGalton's letters long ago grew into short formal notes, which hurt me\nand annoyed me particularly, and I never answered his last, so,\nliterally, I have no one to say things to and get help from, which in\none sense is a comfort when my convictions seem to be leading me on and\non, and gaining strength in spite of all the dreariness of my lot.\n\n'Do you know I can't help being very anxious and unhappy about poor\nSister Harriet. I am afraid of her GOING OUT OF HER MIND. She comforts\nherself by an occasional outpouring of everything to me, and I had a\nletter this morning.... She says Sister May has promised the Vicar never\nto talk to her or allow her to talk on the subject with her, and I doubt\nwhether this can be good for her, because though she has lost her faith,\nshe says, in the Church of England, yet she never thinks of what she\ncould have faith in, and resolutely without inquiring into the question\ndetermines not to be a Roman Catholic, so that really, you see, she is\nallowing her mind to run adrift and yet perfectly powerless.\n\n'Forgive my troubling you with this letter, and believe me to be always\nyour faithful, grateful and affectionate daughter,\n\n'EMMA RYLE.\n\n'P.S. I wish I could see you once more so very much.'\n\nHow was Manning, a director of souls, and a clergyman of the Church of\nEngland, to reply that in sober truth there was very little to choose\nbetween the state of mind of Sister Emma, or even of Sister Harriet, and\nhis own? The dilemma was a grievous one: when a soldier finds himself\nfighting for a cause in which he has lost faith, it is treachery to\nstop, and it is treachery to go on.\n\nAt last, in the seclusion of his library, Manning turned in agony to\nthose old writings which had provided Newman with so much instruction\nand assistance; perhaps the Fathers would do something for him as well.\nHe ransacked the pages of St. Cyprian and St. Cyril; he went through the\ncomplete works of St. Optatus and St. Leo; he explored the vast\ntreatises of Tertullian and Justin Martyr. He had a lamp put into his\nphaeton, so that he might lose no time during his long winter drives.\nThere he sat, searching St. Chrysostom for some mitigation of his\nanguish, while he sped along between the hedges to distant sufferers, to\nwhom he duly administered the sacraments according to the rites of the\nEnglish Church. He hurried back to commit to his Diary the analysis of\nhis reflections, and to describe, under the mystic formula of secrecy,\nthe intricate workings of his conscience to Robert Wilberforce. But,\nalas! he was no Newman; and even the fourteen folios of St. Augustine\nhimself, strange to say, gave him very little help.\n\nThe final propulsion was to come from an entirely different quarter. In\nNovember, 1847, the Reverend Mr. Gorham was presented by the Lord\nChancellor to the living of Bramford Speke in the diocese of Exeter. The\nBishop, Dr. Phillpotts, was a High Churchman, and he had reason to\nbelieve that Mr. Gorham held evangelical opinions; he therefore\nsubjected him to an examination on doctrine, which took the form partly\nof a verbal interrogatory, lasting thirty-eight hours, and partly of a\nseries of one hundred and forty-nine written questions. At the end of\nthe examination he came to the conclusion that Mr. Gorham held heretical\nviews on the subject of Baptismal Regeneration, and he therefore refused\nto institute. Mr. Gorham, thereupon, took proceedings against the Bishop\nin the Court of Arches. He lost his case; and he then appealed to the\njudicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nThe questions at issue were taken very seriously by a large number of\npersons. In the first place, there was the question of Baptismal\nRegeneration itself. This is by no means an easy one to disentangle; but\nit may be noted that the doctrine of Baptism includes: (1) God's\nintention, that is to say, His purpose in electing certain persons to\neternal life--an abstruse and greatly controverted subject, upon which\nthe Church of England abstains from strict definition; (2) God's action,\nwhether by means of sacraments or otherwise--concerning which the Church\nof England maintains the efficacy of sacraments,' but does not formally\ndeny that grace may be given by other means, repentance and faith being\npresent; and (3) the question whether sacramental grace is given\ninstrumentally, by and at the moment of the act of baptism, or in\nconsequence of an act of prevenient grace rendering the receiver\nworthy--that is to say, whether sacramental grace in baptism is given\nabsolutely or conditionally.\n\nIt was over this last question that the dispute raged hottest in the\nGorham Case. The High Church party, represented by Dr. Phillpotts,\nasserted that the mere act of baptism conferred regeneration upon the\nrecipient and washed away his original sin. To this the Evangelicals,\nheaded by Mr. Gorham, replied that, according to the Articles,\nregeneration would not follow unless baptism was RIGHTLY received. What,\nthen, was the meaning of 'rightly'? Clearly it implied not merely lawful\nadministration, but worthy reception; worthiness, therefore, is the\nessence of the sacrament; and worthiness means faith and repentance.\nNow, two propositions were accepted by both parties--that all infants\nare born in original sin, and that original sin could be washed away by\nbaptism. But how could both these propositions be true, argued Mr.\nGorham, if it was also true that faith and repentance were necessary\nbefore baptism could come into operation at all? How could an infant in\narms be said to be in a state of faith and repentance? How, therefore,\ncould its original sin be washed away by baptism? And yet, as every one\nagreed, washed away it was.\n\nThe only solution of the difficulty lay in the doctrine of prevenient\ngrace; and Mr. Gorham maintained that unless God performed an act of\nprevenient grace by which the infant was endowed with faith and\nrepentance, no act of baptism could be effectual; though to whom, and\nunder what conditions, prevenient grace was given, Mr. Gorham confessed\nhimself unable to decide. The light thrown by the Bible upon the whole\nmatter seemed somewhat dubious, for whereas the baptism of St. Peter's\ndisciples at Jerusalem and St. Philip's at Samaria was followed by the\ngift of the Spirit, in the case of Cornelius the sacrament succeeded the\ngift. St. Paul also was baptised; and as for the language of St. John\niii 5; Rom. vi 3, 4; I Peter iii 21, it admits of more than one\ninterpretation. There could, however, be no doubt that the Church of\nEngland assented to Dr. Phillpotts' opinion; the question was whether or\nnot she excluded Mr. Gorham's. If it was decided that she did, it was\nclear that henceforward, there would be very little peace for\nEvangelicals within her fold.\n\nBut there was another issue, even more fundamental than that of\nBaptismal Regeneration itself, involved in the Gorham trial. An Act\npassed in 1833 had constituted the Judicial Committee of the Privy\nCouncil the supreme court of appeal for such cases; and this Committee\nwas a body composed entirely of laymen. It was thus obvious that the\nRoyal Supremacy was still a fact, and that a collection of lawyers\nappointed by the Crown had the legal right to formulate the religious\ndoctrine of the Church of England. In 1850 their judgment was delivered;\nthey reversed the decision of the Court of Arches, and upheld the\nposition of Mr. Gorham. Whether his views were theologically correct or\nnot, they said, was not their business; it was their business to decide\nwhether the opinions under consideration were contrary or repugnant to\nthe doctrine of the Church of England as enjoined upon the clergy by its\nArticles, Formularies, and Rubrics; and they had come to the conclusion\nthat they were not. The judgement still holds good; and to this day, a\nclergyman of the Church of England is quite at liberty to believe that\nRegeneration does not invariably take place when an infant is baptised.\n\nThe blow fell upon no one with greater violence than upon Manning. Not\nonly was the supreme efficacy of the sign of the cross upon a baby's\nforehead one of his favourite doctrines, but up to that moment he had\nbeen convinced that the Royal Supremacy was a mere accident--a temporary\nusurpation which left the spiritual dominion of the Church essentially\nuntouched. But now the horrid reality rose up before him, crowned and\ntriumphant; it was all too clear that an Act of Parliament, passed by\nJews, Roman Catholics, and Dissenters, was the ultimate authority which\ndecided upon the momentous niceties of the Anglican faith. Mr. Gladstone\nalso, was deeply perturbed. It was absolutely necessary, he wrote, to\n'rescue and defend the conscience of the Church from the present hideous\nsystem'. An agitation was set on foot, and several influential\nAnglicans, with Manning at their head, drew up and signed a formal\nprotest against the Gorham judgment. Mr. Gladstone however, proposed\nanother method of procedure: precipitate action, he declared, must be\navoided at all costs, and he elaborated a scheme for securing\nprocrastination, by which a covenant was to bind all those who believed\nthat an article of the creed had been abolished by Act of Parliament to\ntake no steps in any direction, nor to announce their intention of doing\nso, until a given space of time had elapsed. Mr. Gladstone was hopeful\nthat some good might come of this--though indeed he could not be sure.\n'Among others,' he wrote to Manning, 'I have consulted Robert\nWilberforce and Wegg-Prosser, and they seemed inclined to favour my\nproposal. It might, perhaps, have kept back Lord Feilding. But he is\nlike a cork.'\n\nThe proposal was certainly not favoured by Manning. Protests and\nprocrastinations, approving Wegg-Prossers and cork-like Lord\nFeildings--all this was feeding the wind and folly; the time for action\nhad come.\n\n'I can no longer continue,' he wrote to Robert Wilberforce, 'under oath\nand subscription binding me to the Royal Supremacy in Ecclesiastical\ncauses, being convinced:\n\n  (1) That it is a violation of the Divine Office of the Church.\n\n  (2) That it has involved the Church of England in a separation\n  from the Universal Church, which separation I cannot clear of the\n  character of schism.\n\n  (3) That it has thereby suspended and prevented the functions of\n  the Church of England.'\n\nIt was in vain that Robert Wilberforce pleaded, in vain that Mr.\nGladstone urged upon his mind the significance of John iii 8. ['The wind\nbloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst\nnot tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is everyone that is\nborn of the Spirit.']\n\n'I admit,' Mr. Gladstone wrote, 'that the words might in some way be\nsatisfied by supposing our Lord simply to mean \"the facts of nature are\nunintelligible, therefore, be not afraid if revealed truths be likewise\nbeyond the compass of the understanding\"; but this seems to me a meagre\nmeaning.'\n\nSuch considerations could hold him no longer, and Manning executed the\nresignation of his office and benefice before a public notary. Soon\nafterwards, in the little Chapel off Buckingham Palace Road, kneeling\nbeside Mr. Gladstone, he worshipped for the last time as an Anglican.\nThirty years later the Cardinal told how, just before the Communion\nservice commenced, he turned to his friends with the words:\n\n'I can no longer take the Communion in the Church of England.' 'I rose\nup, and laying my hand on Mr. Gladstone's shoulder, said \"Come\". It was\nthe parting of the ways. Mr. Gladstone remained; and I went my way. Mr.\nGladstone still remains where I left him.'\n\nOn April 6th, 1851, the final step was taken: Manning was received into\nthe Roman Catholic Church. Now at last, after the long struggle, his\nmind was at rest.\n\n'I know what you mean,' he wrote to Robert Wilberforce, 'by saying that\none sometimes feels as if all this might turn out to be only another\n\"Land of Shadows\". I have felt it in time past, but not now. The\ntheologia from Nice to St. Thomas Aquinas, and the undivided unity\nsuffused throughout the world, of which the Cathedra Petri is the\ncentre, is now 1800 years old, and mightier in every power now than\never--in intellect, in science, in separation from the world; and purer\ntoo, refined by 300 years of conflict with the modern infidel\ncivilisation--all of this is a fact more solid than the earth.'\n\n\nV.\n\nWHEN Manning joined the Church of Rome, he acted under the combined\nimpulse of the two dominating forces in his nature. His preoccupation\nwith the supernatural might, alone, have been satisfied within the fold\nof the Anglican communion; and so might his preoccupation with\nhimself--the one might have found vent in the elaborations of High\nChurch ritual, and the other in the activities of a bishopric. But the\ntwo together could not be quieted so easily. The Church of England is a\ncommodious institution; she is very anxious to please, but somehow or\nother, she has never managed to supply a happy home to superstitious\negotists. 'What an escape for my poor soul!' Manning is said to have\nexclaimed when, shortly after his conversion, a mitre was going\na-begging. But, in truth, Manning's 'poor soul' had scented nobler\nquarry. To one of his temperament, how was it possible, when once the\nchoice was plainly put, to hesitate for a moment between the respectable\ndignity of an English bishop, harnessed by the secular power, with the\nGorham judgment as a bit between his teeth, and the illimitable\npretensions of the humblest priest of Rome?\n\nFor the moment, however, it seemed as if the Fates had at last been\nsuccessful in their little game of shunting Manning. The splendid career\nwhich he had so laboriously built up from the small beginnings of his\nSussex curacy was shattered--and shattered by the inevitable operation\nof his own essential needs. He was over forty, and he had been put back\nonce more to the very bottom rung of the ladder--a middle-aged neophyte\nwith, so far as could be seen, no special claim to the attention of his\nnew superiors. The example of Newman, a far more illustrious convert,\nwas hardly reassuring: he had been relegated to a complete obscurity, in\nwhich he was to remain until extreme old age. Why should there be\nanything better in store for Manning? Yet it so happened that within\nfourteen years of his conversion Manning was Archbishop of Westminster\nand the supreme ruler of the Roman Catholic community in England. This\ntime the Fates gave up the unequal struggle; they paid over their stakes\nin despair, and retired from the game.\n\nNevertheless it is difficult to feel quite sure that Manning's plunge\nwas as hazardous as it appeared. Certainly he was not a man who was\nlikely to forget to look before he leaped, nor one who, if he happened\nto know that there was a mattress spread to receive him, would leap with\nless conviction. In the light of after-events, one would be glad to know\nwhat precisely passed at that mysterious interview of his with the Pope,\nthree years before his conversion. It is at least possible that the\nauthorities in Rome had their eye on Manning; the may well have felt\nthat the Archdeacon of Chichester would be a great catch. What did Pio\nNono say? It is easy to imagine the persuasive innocence of his Italian\nvoice. 'Ah, dear Signor Manning, why don't you come over to us? Do you\nsuppose that we should not look after you?'\n\nAt any rate, when he did go over, Manning was looked after very\nthoroughly. There was, it is true, a momentary embarrassment at the\noutset: it was only with the greatest difficulty that he could bring\nhimself to abandon his faith in the validity of Anglican Orders, in\nwhich he believed 'with consciousness stronger than all reasoning'. He\nwas convinced that he was still a priest. When the Rev. Mr. Tierney, who\nhad received him into the Roman Catholic communion, assured him that\nthis was not the case, he was filled with dismay and mortification.\nAfter a five hour discussion, he started to his feet in a rage. 'Then,\nMr. Tierney,' he exclaimed, 'you think me insincere.'\n\nThe bitter draught was swallowed at last, and, after that, all went\nsmoothly. Manning hastened to Rome, and was immediately placed by the\nPope in the highly select Accademia Ecclesiastica, commonly known as the\n'Nursery of Cardinals', for the purpose of completing his theological\nstudies. When the course was finished, he continued, by the Pope's\nspecial request, to spend six months of every year in Rome, where he\npreached to the English visitors, became acquainted with the great\npersonages of the Papal court, and enjoyed the privilege of constant\ninterviews with the Holy Father. At the same time, he was able to make\nhimself useful in London, where Cardinal Wiseman, the newly created\nArchbishop of Westminster, was seeking to reanimate the Roman Catholic\ncommunity. Manning was not only extremely popular in the pulpit and in\nthe confessional; he was not only highly efficient as a gleaner of\nsouls--and of souls who moved in the best society; he also possessed a\nfamiliarity with official persons and official ways, which was\ninvaluable. When the question arose of the appointment of Catholic\nchaplains in the Crimea during the war, it was Manning who approached\nthe Minister, interviewed the Permanent Secretary, and finally succeeded\nin obtaining all that was required. When a special Reformatory for\nCatholic children was proposed, Manning carried through the negotiation\nwith the Government. When an attempt was made to remove Catholic\nchildren from the Workhouses, Manning was again indispensable. No wonder\nCardinal Wiseman soon determined to find some occupation of special\nimportance for the energetic convert. He had long wished to establish a\ncongregation of secular priests in London particularly devoted to his\nservice, and the opportunity for the experiment had clearly now arisen.\nThe order of the Oblates of St. Charles was founded in Bayswater, and\nManning was put at its head. Unfortunately, no portion of the body of\nSt. Charles could be obtained for the new community, but two relics of\nhis blood were brought over to Bayswater from Milan. Almost at the same\ntime the Pope signified his appreciation of Manning's efforts by\nappointing him Provost of the Chapter of Westminster--a position which\nplaced him at the head of the Canons of the diocese.\n\nThis double promotion was the signal for the outbreak of an\nextraordinary internal struggle, which raged without intermission for\nthe next seven years, and was to end only with the accession of Manning\nto the Archbishopric. The condition of the Roman Catholic community in\nEngland was at that time a singular one. On the one hand the old\nrepressive laws of the seventeenth century had been repealed by liberal\nlegislation, and on the other a large new body of distinguished converts\nhad entered the Roman Church as a result of the Oxford Movement. It was\nevident that there was a 'boom' in English Catholicism, and, in 1850,\nPius IX recognised the fact by dividing up the whole of England into\ndioceses, and placing Wiseman at the head of them as Archbishop of\nWestminster. Wiseman's encyclical, dated 'from without the Flaminian\nGate', in which he announced the new departure, was greeted in England\nby a storm of indignation, culminating in the famous and furibund letter\nof Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister, against the insolence of the\n'Papal Aggression'. Though the particular point against which the outcry\nwas raised--the English territorial titles of the new Roman bishops--was\nan insignificant one, the instinct of Lord John and of the English\npeople was in reality sound enough. Wiseman's installation did mean, in\nfact, a new move in the Papal game; it meant an advance, if not an\naggression--a quickening in England of the long-dormant energies of the\nRoman Church. That Church has never had the reputation of being an\ninstitution to be trifled with; and, in those days, the Pope was still\nruling as a temporal Prince over the fairest provinces of Italy. Surely,\nif the images of Guy Fawkes had not been garnished, on that fifth of\nNovember, with triple crowns, it would have been a very poor compliment\nto His Holiness.\n\nBut it was not only the honest Protestants of England who had cause to\ndread the arrival of the new Cardinal Archbishop; there was a party\namong the Catholics themselves who viewed his installation with alarm\nand disgust. The families in which the Catholic tradition had been\nhanded down uninterruptedly since the days of Elizabeth, which had known\nthe pains of exile and of martyrdom, and which clung together an alien\nand isolated group in the midst of English society, now began to feel\nthat they were, after all, of small moment in the counsels of Rome. They\nhad laboured through the heat of the day, but now it seemed as if the\nharvest was to be gathered in by a crowd of converts who were\nproclaiming on every side as something new and wonderful the truths\nwhich the Old Catholics, as they came to be called, had not only known,\nbut for which they had suffered for generations. Cardinal Wiseman, it is\ntrue, was no convert; he belonged to one of the oldest of the Catholic\nfamilies; but he had spent most of his life in Rome, he was out of touch\nwith English traditions, and his sympathy with Newman and his followers\nwas only too apparent. One of his first acts as Archbishop was to\nappoint the convert W. G. Ward, who was not even in holy orders, to be\nProfessor of Theology at St. Edmund's College--the chief seminary for\nyoung priests, in which the ancient traditions of Douay were still\nflourishing. Ward was an ardent Papalist and his appointment indicated\nclearly enough that in Wiseman's opinion there was too little of the\nItalian spirit in the English community. The uneasiness of the Old\nCatholics was becoming intense, when they were reassured by Wiseman's\nappointing as his co-adjutor and successor his intimate friend, Dr.\nErrington, who was created on the occasion Archbishop of Trebizond in\npartibus infidelium. Not only was Dr. Errington an Old Catholic of the\nmost rigid type, he was a man of extreme energy, whose influence was\ncertain to be great; and, in any case, Wiseman was growing old, so that\nbefore very long it seemed inevitable that the policy of the diocese\nwould be in proper hands. Such was the position of affairs when, two\nyears after Errington's appointment, Manning became head of the Oblates\nof St. Charles and Provost of the Chapter of Westminster.\n\nThe Archbishop of Trebizond had been for some time growing more and more\nsuspicious of Manning's influence, and this sudden elevation appeared to\njustify his worst fears. But his alarm was turned to fury when he\nlearned that St. Edmund's College, from which he had just succeeded in\nremoving the obnoxious W. G. Ward, was to be placed under the control of\nthe Oblates of St. Charles. The Oblates did not attempt to conceal the\nfact that one of their principal aims was to introduce the customs of a\nRoman Seminary into England. A grim perspective of espionage and\ntale-bearing, foreign habits, and Italian devotions opened out before\nthe dismayed eyes of the Old Catholics; they determined to resist to the\nutmost; and it was upon the question of the control of St. Edmund's that\nthe first battle in the long campaign between Errington and Manning was\nfought.\n\nCardinal Wiseman was now obviously declining towards the grave. A man of\nvast physique--'your immense', an Irish servant used respectfully to\ncall him--of sanguine temperament, of genial disposition, of versatile\ncapacity, he seemed to have engrafted upon the robustness of his English\nnature the facile, child-like, and expansive qualities of the South. So\nfar from being a Bishop Blougram (as the rumour went) he was, in fact,\nthe very antithesis of that subtle and worldly-wise ecclesiastic. He had\ninnocently looked forward all his life to the reunion of England to the\nSee of Peter, and eventually had come to believe that, in God's hand, he\nwas the instrument destined to bring about this miraculous consummation.\nWas not the Oxford Movement, with its flood of converts, a clear sign of\nthe Divine will? Had he not himself been the author of that momentous\narticle on St. Augustine and the Donatists, which had finally convinced\nNewman that the Church of England was in schism? And then, had he not\nbeen able to set afoot a Crusade of Prayer throughout Catholic Europe\nfor the conversion of England?\n\nHe awaited the result with eager expectation, and in the meantime he set\nhimself to smooth away the hostility of his countrymen by delivering\ncourses of popular lectures on literature and archaeology. He devoted\nmuch time and attention to the ceremonial details of his princely\noffice. His knowledge of rubric and ritual, and of the symbolical\nsignifications of vestments, has rarely been equalled, and he took a\nprofound delight in the ordering and the performance of elaborate\nprocessions. During one of these functions, an unexpected difficulty\narose: the Master of Ceremonies suddenly gave the word for a halt, and,\non being asked the reason, replied that he had been instructed that\nmoment by special revelation to stop the procession. The Cardinal,\nhowever, was not at a loss. 'You may let the procession go on,' he\nsmilingly replied. 'I have just obtained permission, by special\nrevelation, to proceed with it.' His leisure hours he spent in the\nwriting of edifying novels, the composition of acrostics in Latin Verse,\nand in playing battledore and shuttlecock with his little nieces. There\nwas, indeed, only one point in which he resembled Bishop Blougram--his\nlove of a good table. Some of Newman's disciples were astonished and\ngrieved to find that he sat down to four courses of fish during Lent. 'I\nam sorry to say,' remarked one of them afterwards, 'that there is a\nlobster salad side to the Cardinal.'\n\nIt was a melancholy fate which ordained that the last years of this\ncomfortable, easygoing, innocent old man should be distracted and\nembittered by the fury of opposing principles and the venom of personal\nanimosities. But so it was. He had fallen into the hands of one who\ncared very little for the gentle pleasures of repose. Left to himself,\nWiseman might have compromised with the Old Catholics and Dr. Errington;\nbut when Manning had once appeared upon the scene, all compromise became\nimpossible. The late Archdeacon of Chichester, who had understood so\nwell and practised with such careful skill the precept of the golden\nmean so dear to the heart of the Church of England, now, as Provost of\nWestminster, flung himself into the fray with that unyielding intensity\nof fervour, that passion for the extreme and the absolute, which is the\nvery lifeblood of the Church of Rome. Even the redoubtable Dr.\nErrington, short, thickset, determined, with his `hawk-like expression\nof face', as a contemporary described him, 'as he looked at you through\nhis blue spectacles', had been known to quail in the presence of his,\nantagonist, with his tall and graceful figure, his pale ascetic\nfeatures, his compressed and icy lips, his calm and penetrating gaze. As\nfor the poor Cardinal, he was helpless indeed.\n\nHenceforward, there was to be no paltering with that dangerous spirit of\nindependence--was it not almost Gallicanism which possessed the Old\nCatholic families of England? The supremacy of the Vicar of Christ must\nbe maintained at all hazards. Compared with such an object, what were\nthe claims of personal affection and domestic peace? The Cardinal\npleaded in vain; his lifelong friendship with Dr. Errington was plucked\nup by the roots, and the harmony of his private life was utterly\ndestroyed. His own household was turned against him. His favourite\nnephew, whom he had placed among the Oblates under Manning's special\ncare, left the congregation and openly joined the party of Dr.\nErrington. His secretary followed suit; but saddest of all was the case\nof Monsignor Searle. Monsignor Searle, in the capacity of confidential\nman of affairs, had dominated over the Cardinal in private for years\nwith the autocratic fidelity of a servant who has grown indispensable.\nHis devotion, in fact, seemed to have taken the form of physical\nimitation, for he was hardly less gigantic than his master. The two were\ninseparable; their huge figures loomed together like neighbouring\nmountains; and on one occasion, meeting them in the street, a gentleman\ncongratulated Wiseman on 'your Eminence's fine son'. Yet now even this\ncompanionship was broken up. The relentless Provost here too brought a\nsword. There were explosions and recriminations. Monsignor Searle,\nfinding that his power was slipping from him, made scenes and protests,\nand at last was foolish enough to accuse Manning of peculation to his\nface; after that it was clear that his day was over; he was forced to\nslink snarling into the background, while the Cardinal shuddered through\nall his immensity, and wished many times that he were already dead.\n\nYet, he was not altogether without his consolations; Manning took care\nto see to that. His piercing eye had detected the secret way into the\nrecesses of the Cardinal's heart--had discerned the core of simple faith\nwhich underlay that jovial manner and that facile talk. Others were\ncontent to laugh and chatter and transact their business; Manning was\nmore artistic. He watched his opportunity, and then, when the moment\ncame, touched with a deft finger the chord of the Conversion of England.\nThere was an immediate response, and he struck the same chord again, and\nyet again. He became the repository of the Cardinal's most intimate\naspirations. He alone sympathised and understood. 'If God gives me\nstrength to undertake a great wrestling-match with infidelity,' Wiseman\nwrote, 'I shall owe it to him.'\n\nBut what he really found himself undertaking was a wrestling-match with\nDr. Errington. The struggle over St. Edmund's College grew more and more\nacute. There were high words in the Chapter, where Monsignor Searle led\nthe assault against the Provost, and carried a resolution declaring that\nthe Oblates of St. Charles had intruded themselves illegally into the\nSeminary. The Cardinal quashed the proceedings of the Chapter;\nwhereupon, the Chapter appealed to Rome. Dr. Errington, carried away by\nthe fury of the controversy, then appeared as the avowed opponent of the\nProvost and the Cardinal. With his own hand he drew up a document\njustifying the appeal of the Chapter to Rome by Canon Law and the\ndecrees of the Council of Trent. Wiseman was deeply pained: 'My own\nco-adjutor,' he exclaimed, 'is acting as solicitor against me in a\nlawsuit.' There was a rush to Rome, where, for several ensuing years,\nthe hostile English parties were to wage a furious battle in the\nantechambers of the Vatican. But the dispute over the Oblates now sank\ninto insignificance beside the rage of contention which centred round a\nnew and far more deadly question; for the position of Dr. Errington\nhimself was at stake. The Cardinal, in spite of illness, indolence, and\nthe ties of friendship, had been brought at last to an extraordinary\nstep--he was petitioning the Pope for nothing less than the deprivation\nand removal of the Archbishop of Trebizond.\n\nThe precise details of what followed are doubtful. It is only possible\nto discern with clearness, amid a vast cloud of official documents and\nunofficial correspondences in English, Italian, and Latin, of Papal\ndecrees and voluminous scritture, of confidential reports of episcopal\nwhispers and the secret agitations of Cardinals, the form of Manning,\nrestless and indomitable, scouring like a stormy petrel the angry ocean\nof debate. Wiseman, dilatory, unbusinesslike, and infirm, was ready\nenough to leave the conduct of affairs in his hands. Nor was it long\nbefore Manning saw where the key of the whole position lay. As in the\nold days, at Chichester, he had secured the goodwill of Bishop\nShuttleworth by cultivating the friendship of Archdeacon Hare, so now,\non this vaster scale of operations, his sagacity led him swiftly and\nunerringly up the little winding staircase in the Vatican and through\nthe humble door which opened into the cabinet of Monsignor Talbot, the\nprivate secretary of the Pope. Monsignor Talbot was a priest who\nembodied in a singular manner, if not the highest, at least the most\npersistent traditions of the Roman Curia. He was a master of various\narts which the practice of ages has brought to perfection under the\nfriendly shadow of the triple tiara. He could mingle together astuteness\nand holiness without any difficulty; he could make innuendoes as\nnaturally as an ordinary man makes statements of fact; he could apply\nflattery with so unsparing a hand that even Princes of the Church found\nit sufficient; and, on occasion, he could ring the changes of torture on\na human soul with a tact which called forth universal approbation. With\nsuch accomplishments, it could hardly be expected that Monsignor Talbot\nshould be remarkable either for a delicate sense of conscientiousness or\nfor an extreme refinement of feeling, but then it was not for those\nqualities that Manning was in search when he went up the winding stair.\nHe was looking for the man who had the ear of Pio Nono; and, on the\nother side of the low-arched door, he found him. Then he put forth all\nhis efforts; his success was complete; and an alliance began which was\ndestined to have the profoundest effect upon Manning's career, and was\nonly dissolved when, many years later, Monsignor Talbot was\nunfortunately obliged to exchange his apartment in the Vatican for a\nprivate lunatic asylum at Passy.\n\nIt was determined that the coalition should be ratified by the ruin of\nDr. Errington. When the moment of crisis was seen to be approaching,\nWiseman was summoned to Rome, where he began to draw up an immense\nscrittura containing his statement of the case. For months past, the\nredoubtable energies of the Archbishop of Trebizond had been absorbed in\na similar task. Folio was being piled upon folio, when a sudden blow\nthreatened to put an end to the whole proceeding in a summary manner.\nThe Cardinal was seized by violent illness, and appeared to be upon his\ndeathbed. Manning thought for a moment that his labours had been in vain\nand that all was lost. But the Cardinal recovered; Monsignor Talbot used\nhis influence as he alone knew how; and a papal decree was issued by\nwhich Dr. Errington was 'liberated' from the Coadjutorship of\nWestminster, together with the right of succession to the See.\n\nIt was a supreme act of authority--a 'colpo di stato di Dominiddio', as\nthe Pope himself said--and the blow to the Old Catholics was\ncorrespondingly severe. They found themselves deprived at one fell swoop\nboth of the influence of their most energetic supporter and of the\ncertainty of coming into power at Wiseman's death. And in the meantime,\nManning was redoubling his energies at Bayswater. Though his Oblates had\nbeen checked over St. Edmund's, there was still no lack of work for them\nto do. There were missions to be carried on, schools to be managed,\nfunds to be collected. Several new churches were built; a community of\nmost edifying nuns of the Third Order of St. Francis was established;\nand L30,000, raised from Manning's private resources and from those of\nhis friends, was spent in three years. 'I hate that man,' one of the Old\nCatholics exclaimed, 'he is such a forward piece.' The words were\nreported to Manning, who shrugged his shoulders.\n\n'Poor man,' he said, 'what is he made of? Does he suppose, in his\nfoolishness, that after working day and night for twenty years in heresy\nand schism, on becoming a Catholic, I should sit in an easy-chair and\nfold my hands all the rest of my life?'\n\nBut his secret thoughts were of a different caste.\n\n'I am conscious of a desire,' he wrote in his Diary, 'to be in such a\nposition: (I) as I had in times past; (2) as my present circumstances\nimply; (3) as my friends think me fit for; and (4) as I feel my own\nfaculties tend to.\n\n'But, God being my helper, I will not seek it by the lifting of a finger\nor the speaking, of a word.'\n\nSo Manning wrote, and thought, and prayed; but what are words, and\nthoughts, and even prayers, to the mysterious and relentless powers of\ncircumstance and character? Cardinal Wiseman was slowly dying; the\ntiller of the Church was slipping from his feeble hand; and Manning was\nbeside him, the one man with the energy, the ability, the courage, and\nthe conviction to steer the ship upon her course. More than that; there\nwas the sinister figure of a Dr. Errington crouching close at hand,\nready to seize the helm and make straight--who could doubt it?--for the\nrocks. In such a situation the voice of self-abnegation must needs grow\nstill and small indeed. Yet it spoke on, for it was one of the paradoxes\nin Manning's soul that that voice was never silent. Whatever else he\nwas, he was not unscrupulous. Rather, his scruples deepened with his\ndesires; and he could satisfy his most exorbitant ambitions in a\nprofundity of self-abasement. And so now he vowed to Heaven that he\nwould SEEK nothing--no, not by the lifting of a finger or the speaking\nof a word. But, if something came to him--? He had vowed not to seek; he\nhad not vowed not to take. Might it not be his plain duty to take? Might\nit not be the will of God?\n\nSomething, of course, did come to him, though it seemed for a moment\nthat it would elude his grasp. Wiseman died, and there ensued in Rome a\ncrisis of extraordinary intensity. 'Since the creation of the\nhierarchy,' Monsignor Talbot wrote, it is the greatest moment for the\nChurch that I have yet seen.' It was the duty of the Chapter of\nWestminster to nominate three candidates for succession to the\nArchbishopric; they made one last effort, and had the temerity to place\nupon the list, besides the names of two Old Catholic bishops, that of\nDr. Errington. It was a fatal blunder. Pius IX was furious; the Chapter\nhad committed an 'insulta al Papa', he exclaimed, striking his breast\nthree times in his rage. 'It was the Chapter that did it,' said Manning,\nafterwards; but even after the Chapter's indiscretion, the fatal\ndecision hung in the balance for weeks.\n\n'The great point of anxiety with me, wrote Monsignor Talbot to Manning,\n'is whether a Congregation will be held, or whether the Holy Father will\nperform a Pontifical act. He himself is doubting. I therefore say mass\nand pray every morning that he may have the courage to choose for\nhimself, instead of submitting the matter to a Congregation. Although\nthe Cardinals are determined to reject Dr. Errington, nevertheless I am\nafraid that they should select one of the others. You know very well\nthat Congregations are guided by the documents that are placed before\nthem; it is for this reason that I should prefer the Pope's acting\nhimself.'\n\nBut the Holy Father himself was doubting. In his indecision, he ordered\na month of prayers and masses. The suspense grew and grew. Everything\nseemed against Manning. The whole English episcopate was opposed to him;\nhe had quarrelled with the Chapter; he was a convert of but few years'\nstanding; even the congregated Cardinals did not venture to suggest the\nappointment of such a man. But suddenly, the Holy Father's doubts came\nto an end. He heard a voice--a mysterious inward voice--whispering\nsomething in his ear. 'Mettetelo li! Mettetelo li!' the voice repeated,\nover and over again. Mettetelo li! It was an inspiration; and Pius IX,\nbrushing aside the recommendations of the Chapter and the deliberations\nof the Cardinals, made Manning, by a Pontifical act, Archbishop of\nWestminster.\n\nMonsignor Talbot's felicity was complete; and he took occasion in\nconveying his congratulations to his friend, to make some illuminating\nreflections upon the great event.\n\n'MY policy throughout,' he wrote, 'was never to propose you DIRECTLY to\nthe Pope, but, to make others do so, so that both you and I can always\nsay that it was not I who induced the Holy Father to name you--which\nwould lessen the weight of your appointment. This I say, because many\nhave said that your being named was all my doing. I do not say that the\nPope did not know that I thought you the only man eligible--as I took\ncare to tell him over and over again what was against all the other\ncandidates--and in consequence, he was almost driven into naming you.\nAfter he had named you, the Holy Father said to me, \"What a diplomatist\nyou are, to make what you wished come to pass!\"\n\n'Nevertheless,' concluded Monsignor Talbot, 'I believe your appointment\nwas specially directed by the Holy Ghost.'\n\nManning himself was apparently of the same opinion.\n\n'My dear Child,' he wrote to a lady penitent, 'I have in these last\nthree weeks felt as if our Lord had called me by name. Everything else\nhas passed out of my mind. The firm belief that I have long had that the\nHoly Father is the most supernatural person I have ever seen has given\nme this feeling more deeply. 'Still, I feel as if I had been brought,\ncontrary to all human wills, by the Divine Will, into an immediate\nrelation to our Divine Lord.'\n\n'If indeed,' he wrote to Lady Herbert, 'it were the will of our Divine\nLord to lay upon me this heavy burden, He could have done it in no way\nmore strengthening and consoling to me. To receive it from the hands of\nHis Vicar, and from Pius IX, and after long invocation of the Holy\nGhost, and not only without human influences, but in spite of manifold\naria powerful human opposition, gives me the last strength for such a\ncross.'\n\n\nVI\n\nMANNING'S appointment filled his opponents with alarm. Wrath and\nvengeance seemed to be hanging over them; what might not be expected\nfrom the formidable enemy against whom they had struggled for so long,\nand who now stood among them armed with archiepiscopal powers and\ninvested with the special confidence of Rome? Great was their amazement,\ngreat was their relief, when they found that their dreaded master\nbreathed nothing but kindness, gentleness, and conciliation. The old\nscores, they found, were not to be paid off, but to be wiped out. The\nnew archbishop poured forth upon every side all the tact, all the\ncourtesy, all the dignified graces of a Christian magnanimity. It was\nimpossible to withstand such treatment. Bishops who had spent years in\nthwarting him became his devoted adherents; even the Chapter of\nWestminster forgot its hatred. Monsignor Talbot was extremely surprised.\n'Your greatest enemies have entirely come round,' he wrote. 'I received\nthe other day a panegyric of you from Searle. This change of feeling I\ncannot attribute to anything but the Holy Ghost.' Monsignor Talbot was\nvery fond of the Holy Ghost; but, so far, at any rate as Searle was\nconcerned, there was another explanation. Manning, instead of dismissing\nSearle from his position of 'oeconomus' in the episcopal household, had\nkept him on--at an increased salary; and the poor man, who had not\nscrupled in the days of his pride to call Manning a thief, was now duly\ngrateful.\n\nAs to Dr. Errington, he gave an example of humility and submission by at\nonce withdrawing into a complete obscurity. For years the Archbishop of\nTrebizond, the ejected heir to the See of Westminster, laboured as a\nparish priest in the Isle of Man. He nursed no resentment in his heart,\nand, after a long and edifying life of peace and silence, he died in\n1886, a professor of theology at Clifton.\n\nIt might be supposed that Manning could now feel that his triumph was\ncomplete. His position was secure; his power was absolute; his prestige\nwas daily growing. Yet there was something that irked him still. As he\ncast his eyes over the Roman Catholic community in England, he was aware\nof one figure which, by virtue of a peculiar eminence, seemed to\nchallenge the supremacy of his own. That figure was Newman's.\n\nSince his conversion, Newman's life had been a long series of\nmisfortunes and disappointments. When he had left the Church of England,\nhe was its most distinguished, its most revered member, whose words,\nhowever strange, were listened to with profound attention, and whose\nopinions, however dubious, were followed in all their fluctuations with\nan eager and indeed a trembling respect. He entered the Church of Rome,\nand found himself forthwith an unimportant man. He was received at the\nPapal Court with a politeness which only faintly concealed a total lack\nof interest and understanding. His delicate mind, with its refinements,\nits hesitations, its complexities--his soft, spectacled, Oxford manner,\nwith its half-effeminate diffidence-such things were ill calculated to\nimpress a throng of busy Cardinals and Bishops, whose days were spent\namid the practical details of ecclesiastical organisation, the\nlong-drawn involutions of papal diplomacy, and the delicious bickerings\nof personal intrigue. And when, at last, he did succeed in making some\nimpression upon these surroundings, it was no better; it was worse. An\nuneasy suspicion gradually arose; it began to dawn upon the Roman\nauthorities that Dr. Newman was a man of ideas. Was it possible that Dr.\nNewman did not understand that ideas in Rome were, to say the least of\nit, out of place? Apparently, he did not--nor was that all; not content\nwith having ideas, he positively seemed anxious to spread them. When\nthat was known, the politeness in high places was seen to be wearing\ndecidedly thin. His Holiness, who on Newman's arrival had graciously\nexpressed the wish to see him 'again and again', now, apparently, was\nconstantly engaged. At first Newman supposed that the growing coolness\nwas the result of misapprehension; his Italian was faulty, Latin was not\nspoken at Rome, his writings had only appeared in garbled translations.\nAnd even Englishmen had sometimes found his arguments difficult to\nfollow. He therefore determined to take the utmost care to make his\nviews quite clear; his opinions upon religious probability, his\ndistinction between demonstrative and circumstantial evidence, his\ntheory of the development of doctrine and the aspects of ideas--these\nand many other matters, upon which he had written so much, he would now\nexplain in the simplest language. He would show that there was nothing\ndangerous in what he held, that there was a passage in De Lugo which\nsupported him--that Perrone, by maintaining that the Immaculate\nConception could be defined, had implicitly admitted one of his main\npositions, and that his language about Faith had been confused, quite\nerroneously, with the fideism of M. Bautain.\n\nCardinal Barnabo, Cardinal Reisach, Cardinal Antonelli, looked at him\nwith their shrewd eyes and hard faces, while he poured into their ears\nwhich, as he had already noticed with distress, were large and not too\nclean--his careful disquisitions; but, it was all in vain--they had\nclearly never read De Lugo or Perrone, and as for M. Bautain, they had\nnever heard of him. Newman, in despair, fell back upon St. Thomas\nAquinas; but, to his horror, he observed that St. Thomas himself did not\nmean very much to the Cardinals. With a sinking heart, he realised at\nlast the painful truth: it was not the nature of his views, it was his\nhaving views at all, that was objectionable. He had hoped to devote the\nrest of his life to the teaching of Theology; but what sort of Theology\ncould he teach which would be acceptable to such superiors? He left\nRome, and settled down in Birmingham as the head of a small community of\nOratorians. He did not complain; it was God's will; it was better so. He\nwould watch and pray.\n\nBut God's will was not quite so simple as that. Was it right, after all,\nthat a man with Newman's intellectual gifts, his devoted ardour, his\npersonal celebrity, should sink away out of sight and use in the dim\nrecesses of the Oratory at Birmingham? If the call were to come to him\nto take his talent out of the napkin, how could he refuse? And the call\ndid come. A Catholic University was being started in Ireland and Dr.\nCullen, the Archbishop of Armagh, begged Newman to become the Rector. At\nfirst he hesitated, but when he learned that it was the Holy Father's\nwish that he should take up the work, he could doubt no longer; the\noffer was sent from Heaven. The difficulties before him were very great;\nnot only had a new University to be called up out of the void, but the\nposition was complicated by the presence of a rival institution--the\nundenominational Queen's Colleges, founded by Peel a few years earlier\nwith the object of giving Irish Catholics facilities for University\neducation on the same terms as their fellow-countrymen. Yet Newman had\nthe highest hopes. He dreamt of something greater than a merely Irish\nUniversity--of a noble and flourishing centre of learning for the\nCatholics of Ireland and England alike. And why should not his dream\ncome true? 'In the midst of our difficulties, he said, 'I have one\nground of hope, just one stay, but, as I think, a sufficient one, which\nserves me in the stead of all other argument whatever. It is the\ndecision of the Holy See; St. Peter has spoken.'\n\nThe years that followed showed to what extent it was safe to depend upon\nSt. Peter. Unforeseen obstacles cropped up on every side. Newman's\nenergies were untiring, but so was the inertia of the Irish authorities.\nOn his appointment, he wrote to Dr. Cullen asking that arrangements\nmight be made for his reception in Dublin. Dr. Cullen did not reply.\nNewman wrote again, but still there was no answer. Weeks passed, months\npassed, years passed, and not a word, not a sign, came from Dr. Cullen.\nAt last, after dangling for more than two years in the uncertainties and\nperplexities of so strange a situation, Newman was summoned to Dublin.\nThere he found nothing but disorder and discouragement. The laity took\nno interest in the scheme; the clergy actively disliked it; Newman's\nauthority was disregarded. He appealed to Cardinal Wiseman, and then at\nlast a ray of hope dawned. The cardinal suggested that a bishopric\nshould be conferred upon him, to give him a status suitable to his\nposition; Dr. Cullen acquiesced, and Pius IX was all compliance.\n'Manderemo a Newman la crocetta,' he said to Wiseman, smilingly drawing\nhis hands down each side of his neck to his breast, 'lo faremo vescovo\ndi Porfirio, o qualche luogo.' The news spread among Newman's friends,\nand congratulations began to come in. But the official intimation seemed\nto be unaccountably delayed; no crocetta came from Rome, and Cardinal\nWiseman never again referred to the matter. Newman was left to gather\nthat the secret representations of Dr. Cullen had brought about a change\nof counsel in high quarters. His pride did not allow him to inquire\nfurther; but one of his lady penitents, Miss Giberne, was less discreet.\n'Holy Father,' she suddenly said to the Pope in an audience one day,\n'why don't you make Father Newman a bishop?' Upon which the Holy Father\nlooked much confused and took a great deal of snuff.\n\nFor the next five years Newman, unaided and ignored, struggled\ndesperately, like a man in a bog, with the overmastering difficulties of\nhis task. His mind, whose native haunt was among the far aerial\nboundaries of fancy and philosophy, was now clamped down under the\nfetters of petty detail and fed upon the mean diet of compromise and\nroutine. He had to force himself to scrape together money, to write\narticles for the students' Gazette, to make plans for medical\nlaboratories, to be ingratiating with the City Council; he was obliged\nto spend months travelling through the remote regions of Ireland in the\ncompany of extraordinary ecclesiastics and barbarous squireens. He was a\nthoroughbred harnessed to a four-wheeled cab--and he knew it.\nEventually, he realised something else: he saw that the whole project of\na Catholic University had been evolved as a political and ecclesiastical\nweapon against the Queen's Colleges of Peel, and that was all. As an\ninstrument of education, it was simply laughed at; and he himself had\nbeen called in because his name would be a valuable asset in a party\ngame. When he understood that, he resigned his rectorship and returned\nto the Oratory.\n\nBut, his tribulations were not yet over. It seemed to be God's will that\nhe should take part in a whole succession of schemes, which, no less\nthan the project of the Irish University, were to end in disillusionment\nand failure. He was persuaded by Cardinal Wiseman to undertake the\neditorship of a new English version of the Scriptures, which was to be a\nmonument of Catholic scholarship and an everlasting glory to Mother\nChurch. He made elaborate preparations; he collected subscriptions,\nengaged contributors, and composed a long and learned prolegomena to the\nwork. It was all useless; Cardinal Wiseman began to think of other\nthings; and the scheme faded imperceptibly into thin air. Then a new\ntask was suggested to him: \"The Rambler\", a Catholic periodical, had\nfallen on evil days; would Dr Newman come to the rescue, and accept the\neditorship? This time he hesitated rather longer than usual; he had\nburned his fingers so often--he must be specially careful now. 'I did\nall I could to ascertain God's Will,' he said, and he came to the\nconclusion that it was his duty to undertake the work. He did so, and\nafter two numbers had appeared, Dr. Ullathorne, the Bishop of\nBirmingham, called upon him, and gently hinted that he had better leave\nthe paper alone. Its tone was not liked at Rome; it had contained an\narticle criticising St. Pius V, and, most serious of all, the orthodoxy\nof one of Newman's own essays had appeared to be doubtful. He resigned,\nand in the anguish of his heart, determined never to write again. One of\nhis friends asked him why he was publishing nothing. 'Hannibal's\nelephants,' he replied, 'never could learn the goose-step.'\n\nNewman was now an old man--he was sixty-three years of age. What had he\nto look forward to? A few last years of insignificance and silence. What\nhad he to look back upon? A long chronicle of wasted efforts,\ndisappointed hopes, neglected possibilities, unappreciated powers. And\nnow all his labours had ended by his being accused at Rome of lack of\northodoxy. He could no longer restrain his indignation, and in a letter\nto one of his lady penitents, he gave vent to the bitterness of his\nsoul. When his Rambler article had been complained of, he said, there\nhad been some talk of calling him to Rome.\n\n'Call me to Rome,' he burst out--'what does that mean? It means to sever\nan old man from his home, to subject him to intercourse with persons\nwhose languages are strange to him--to food and to fashions which are\nalmost starvation on the one hand, and involve restless days and nights\non the other--it means to oblige him to dance attendance on Propaganda\nweek after week and month after month--it means his death. (It was the\npunishment on Dr. Baines, 1840-1, to keep him at the door of Propaganda\nfor a year.)\n\n'This is the prospect which I cannot but feel probable, did I say\nanything which one Bishop in England chose to speak against and report.\nOthers have been killed before me. Lucas went of his own accord\nindeed--but when he got there, oh!' How much did he, as loyal a son of\nthe Church and the Holy See as ever was, what did he suffer because Dr.\nCullen was against him? He wandered (as Dr. Cullen said in a letter he\npublished in a sort of triumph), he wandered from Church to Church\nwithout a friend, and hardly got an audience from the Pope. 'And I too\nshould go from St. Philip to Our Lady, and to St. Peter and St. Paul,\nand to St. Laurence and to St. Cecilia, and, if it happened to me as to\nLucas, should come back to die.'\n\nYet, in spite of all, in spite of these exasperations of the flesh,\nthese agitations of the spirit, what was there to regret? Had he not a\nmysterious consolation which outweighed every grief? Surely, surely, he\nhad.\n\n    'Unveil, O Lord, and on us shine,\n        In glory and in grace,'\n\nhe exclaims in a poem written at this time, called 'The Two Worlds':\n\n    'This gaudy world grows pale before\n       The beauty of Thy face.\n\n    'Till Thou art seen it seems to he\n       A sort of fairy ground,\n    Where suns unsetting light the sky,\n       And flowers and fruit abound.\n\n    'But when Thy keener, purer beam\n       Is poured upon our sight,\n    It loses all its power to charm,\n       And what was day is night ...\n\n    'And thus, when we renounce for Thee\n       Its restless aims and fears,\n    The tender memories of the past,\n       The hopes of coming years,\n\n    'Poor is our sacrifice, whose eyes\n       Are lighted from above;\n    We offer what we cannot keep,\n       What we have ceased to love.'\n\nSuch were Newman's thoughts when an unexpected event occurred which\nproduced a profound effect upon his life: Charles Kingsley attacked his\ngood faith, and the good faith of Catholics in general, in a magazine\narticle. Newman protested, and Kingsley rejoined in an irate pamphlet.\nNewman's reply was the Apologia pro Vita Sua, which he wrote in seven\nweeks, sometimes working twenty-two hours at a stretch, 'constantly in\ntears, and constantly crying out with distress'. The success of the\nbook, with its transparent candour, its controversial brilliance, the\nsweep and passion of its rhetoric, the depth of its personal feeling,\nwas immediate and overwhelming; it was recognised at once as a classic,\nnot only by Catholics, but by the whole English world. From every side\nexpressions of admiration, gratitude, and devotion poured in. It was\nimpossible for one so sensitive as Newman to the opinions of other\npeople to resist the happy influence of such an unlooked-for, such an\nenormous triumph. The cloud of his dejection began to lift; et l'espoir\nmalgre lui s'est glisse dans son coeur.\n\nIt was only natural that at such a moment his thoughts should return to\nOxford. For some years past proposals had been on foot for establishing\nthere a Hall, under Newman's leadership, for Catholic undergraduates.\nThe scheme had been looked upon with disfavour in Rome, and it had been\nabandoned; but now a new opportunity presented itself--some land in a\nsuitable position came into the market. Newman, with his reviving\nspirits, felt that he could not let this chance go by, and bought the\nland. It was his intention to build there not a Hall, but a Church, and\nto set on foot a 'House of the Oratory'. What possible objection could\nthere be to such a scheme? He approached the Bishop of Birmingham, who\ngave his approval; in Rome itself there was no hostile sign. The laity\nwere enthusiastic and subscriptions began to flow in. Was it possible\nthat all was well at last? Was it conceivable that the strange and weary\npilgrimage of so many years should end at length in quietude, if not in\nhappiness, where it had begun?\n\nIt so happened that it was at this very time that Manning was appointed\nto the See of Westminster. The destinies of the two men, which had run\nparallel to one another in so strange a fashion and for so many years,\nwere now for a moment suddenly to converge. Newly clothed with all the\nattributes of ecclesiastical supremacy, Manning found himself face to\nface with Newman, upon whose brows were glittering the fresh laurels of\nspiritual victory--the crown of an apostolical life. It was the meeting\nof the eagle and the dove. What followed showed, more clearly perhaps\nthan any other incident in his career, the stuff that Manning was made\nof. Power had come to him at last; and he seized it with all the avidity\nof a born autocrat, whose appetite for supreme dominion had been whetted\nby long years of enforced abstinence and the hated simulations of\nsubmission. He was the ruler of Roman Catholic England, and he would\nrule. The nature of Newman's influence it was impossible for him to\nunderstand, but he saw that it existed; for twenty years he had been\nunable to escape the unwelcome iterations of that singular, that alien,\nthat rival renown; and now it stood in his path, alone and inexplicable,\nlike a defiant ghost. 'It is remarkably interesting,' he observed\ncoldly, when somebody asked him what he thought of the Apologia: 'it is\nlike listening to the voice of one from the dead.' And such voices, with\ntheir sepulchral echoes, are apt to be more dangerous than living ones;\nthey attract too much attention; they must be silenced at all costs. It\nwas the meeting of the eagle and the dove; there was a hovering, a\nswoop, and then the quick beak and the relentless talons did their work.\n\nEven before his accession to the Archbishopric, Manning had scented a\npeculiar peril in Newman's Oxford scheme, and so soon as he came into\npower, he privately determined that the author of the Apologia should\nnever be allowed to return to his old University. Nor was there any lack\nof excellent reasons for such a decision. Oxford was by this time a nest\nof liberalism; it was no fit place for Catholic youths, and they would\ninevitably be attracted there by the presence of Father Newman. And\nthen, had not Father Newman's orthodoxy been impugned? Had he not been\nheard to express opinions of most doubtful propriety upon the question\nof the Temporal Power? Was it not known that he might almost be said to\nhave an independent mind? An influence? Yes, he had an influence no\ndoubt; but what a fatal kind of influence to which to subject the rising\ngeneration of Catholic Englishmen!\n\nSuch were the reflections which Manning was careful to pour into the\nreceptive car of Monsignor Talbot. That useful priest, at his post of\nvantage in the Vatican, was more than ever the devoted servant of the\nnew Archbishop. A league, offensive and defensive, had been established\nbetween the two friends.\n\n'I daresay I shall have many opportunities to serve you in Rome,' wrote\nMonsignor Talbot modestly, 'and I do not think any support will be\nuseless to you, especially on account of the peculiar character of the\nPope, and the spirit which pervades Propaganda; therefore, I wish you to\nunderstand that a compact exists between us; if you help me, I shall\nhelp you.' And a little later he added, 'I am glad you accept the\nleague. As I have already done for years, I shall support you, and I\nhave a hundred ways of doing so. A word dropped at the proper occasion\nworks wonders.'\n\nPerhaps it was hardly necessary to remind his correspondent of that.\n\nSo far as Newman was concerned, it so fell out that Monsignor Talbot\nneeded no prompting. During the sensation caused by the appearance of\nthe Apologia, it had occurred to him that it would be an excellent plan\nto secure Newman as a preacher during Lent for the fashionable\ncongregation which attended his church in the Piazza del Popolo; and, he\nhad accordingly written to invite him to Rome. His letter was\nunfortunately not a tactful one. He assured Newman that he would find in\nthe Piazza del Popolo 'an audience of Protestants more educated than\ncould ever be the case in England', and 'I think myself,' he had added\nby way of extra inducement, 'that you will derive great benefit from\nvisiting Rome, and showing yourself to the Ecclesiastical Authorities.'\nNewman smiled grimly at this; he declared to a friend that the letter\nwas 'insolent'; and he could not resist the temptation of using his\nsharp pen.\n\n'Dear Monsignor Talbot,' he wrote in reply, 'I have received your\nletter, inviting me to preach in your Church at Rome to an audience of\nProtestants more educated than could ever be the case in England.\n\n'However, Birmingham people have souls; and I have neither taste nor\ntalent for the sort of work which you cut out for me. And I beg to\ndecline your offer.\n\nI am, yours truly,\n\nJOHN H. NEWMAN.'\n\nSuch words were not the words of wisdom. It is easy to imagine the\nfeelings of Monsignor Talbot. 'Newman's work none here can understand,'\nhe burst out to his friend. 'Poor man, by living almost ever since he\nhas been a Catholic, surrounded by a set of inferior men who idolise\nhim, I do not think he has ever acquired the Catholic instincts.' As for\nhis views on the Temporal Power--'well, people said that he had actually\nsent a subscription to Garibaldi. Yes, the man was incomprehensible,\nheretical, dangerous; he was \"uncatholic and unchristian.\"' Monsignor\nTalbot even trembled for the position of Manning in England.\n\n'I am afraid that the old school of Catholics will rally round Newman in\nopposition to you and Rome. Stand firm, do not yield a bit in the line\nyou have taken. As I have promised, I shall stand by you. You will have\nbattles to fight because every Englishman is naturally anti-Roman. To be\nRoman is an effort to an Englishman an effort. Dr. Newman is more English than\nthe English. His spirit must be crushed.'\n\nHis spirit must be crushed! Certainly there could be no doubt of that.\n\n'What you write about Dr Newman,' Manning replied, 'is true. Whether he\nknows it or not, he has become the centre of those who hold low views\nabout the Holy See, are anti-Roman, cold and silent, to say no more,\nabout the Temporal Power; national, English, critical of Catholic\ndevotions, and always on the lower side.... You will take care,' he\nconcluded, 'that things are correctly known and understood where you\nare.'\n\nThe confederates matured their plans. While Newman was making his\narrangements for the Oxford Oratory, Cardinal Reisach visited London.\n'Cardinal Reisach has just left,' wrote Manning to Monsignor Talbot: 'he\nhas seen and understands all that is going on in England.' But Newman\nhad no suspicions. It was true that persistent rumours of his\nunorthodoxy and his anti-Roman leanings had begun to float about, and\nthese rumours had been traced to Rome. But what were rumours? Then, too,\nNewman found out that Cardinal Reisach had been to Oxford without his\nknowledge, and had inspected the land for the Oratory. That seemed odd;\nbut all doubts were set at rest by the arrival from Propaganda of an\nofficial ratification of his scheme. There would be nothing but plain\nsailing now. Newman was almost happy; radiant visions came into his mind\nof a wonderful future in Oxford, the gradual growth of Catholic\nprinciples, the decay of liberalism, the inauguration of a second Oxford\nMovement, the conversion--who knows?--of Mark Pattison, the triumph of\nthe Church.... 'Earlier failures do not matter now,' he exclaimed to a\nfriend. 'I see that I have been reserved by God for this.'\n\nJust then a long blue envelope was brought into the room. Newman opened\nit. 'All is over,' he said, 'I am not allowed to go.' The envelope\ncontained a letter from the Bishop announcing that, together with the\nformal permission for an Oratory at Oxford, Propaganda had issued a\nsecret instruction to the effect that Newman himself was by no means to\nreside there. If he showed signs of doing so, he was blandly and suavely\n('blande suaviterque' were the words of the Latin instrument) to be\nprevented. And now the secret instruction had come into\noperation--blande suaviterque: Dr. Newman's spirit had been crushed.\n\nHis friends made some gallant efforts to retrieve the situation; but, it\nwas in vain. Father St. John hurried to Rome and the indignant laity of\nEngland, headed by Lord Edward Howard, the guardian of the young Duke of\nNorfolk, seized the opportunity of a particularly virulent anonymous\nattack upon Newman, to send him an address in which they expressed their\nfeeling that 'every blow that touches you inflicts a wound upon the\nCatholic Church in this country'. The only result was an outburst of\nredoubled fury upon the part of Monsignor Talbot. The address, he\ndeclared, was an insult to the Holy See. 'What is the province of the\nlaity?' he interjected. 'To hunt, to shoot, to entertain. These matters\nthey understand, but to meddle with ecclesiastical matters they have no\nright at all.' Once more he warned Manning to be careful.\n\n'Dr. Newman is the most dangerous man in England, and you will see that\nhe will make use of the laity against your Grace. You must not be afraid\nof him. It will require much prudence, but you must be firm. The Holy\nFather still places his confidence in you; but if you yield and do not\nfight the battle of the Holy See against the detestable spirit growing\nup in England, he will begin to regret Cardinal Wiseman, who knew how to\nkeep the laity in order.' Manning had no thought of 'yielding'; but, he\npointed out to his agitated friend that an open conflict between himself\nand Newman would be 'as great a scandal to the Church in England, and as\ngreat a victory to the Anglicans, as could be'. He would act quietly,\nand there would be no more difficulty. The Bishops were united, and the\nChurch was sound.\n\nOn this, Monsignor Talbot hurried to Father St. John's lodgings in Rome\nto express his regret at the misunderstanding that had arisen, to wonder\nhow it could possibly have occurred, and to hope that Dr. Newman might\nconsent to be made a Protonotary Apostolic. That was all the\nsatisfaction that Father St. John was to obtain from his visit to Rome.\nA few weeks later, the scheme of the Oxford Oratory was finally quashed.\n\nWhen all was over, Manning thought that the time had come for a\nreconciliation. He made advances through a common friend; what had he\ndone, he asked, to offend Dr. Newman? Letters passed, and, naturally\nenough, they only widened the breach. Newman was not the man to be\npolite.\n\n'I can only repeat,' he wrote at last, 'what I said when you last heard\nfrom me. I do not know whether I am on my head or my heels when I have\nactive relations with you. In spite of my friendly feelings, this is the\njudgment of my intellect.' 'Meanwhile,' he concluded, 'I propose to say\nseven masses for your intention amid the difficulties and anxieties of\nyour ecclesiastical duties.'\n\nAnd Manning could only return the compliment.\n\nAt about this time, the Curate of Littlemore had a singular experience.\nAs he was passing by the Church he noticed an old man, very poorly\ndressed in an old grey coat with the collar turned up, leaning over the\nlych gate, in floods of tears. He was apparently in great trouble, and\nhis hat was pulled down over his eyes as if he wished to hide his\nfeatures. For a moment, however, he turned towards the Curate, who was\nsuddenly struck by something familiar in the face. Could it be--? A\nphotograph hung over the Curate's mantelpiece of the man who had made\nLittlemore famous by his sojourn there more than twenty years ago--he\nhad never seen the original; but now, was it possible--? He looked\nagain, and he could doubt no longer. It was Dr. Newman. He sprang\nforward, with proffers of assistance. Could he be of any use? 'Oh no,\nno!' was the reply. 'Oh no, no!' But the Curate felt that he could not\nrun away and leave so eminent a character in such distress. 'Was it not\nDr. Newman he had the honour of addressing?' he asked, with all the\nrespect and sympathy at his command. 'Was there nothing that could be\ndone?' But the old man hardly seemed to understand what was being said\nto him. 'Oh no, no!' he repeated, with the tears streaming down his\nface, 'Oh no, no!'\n\n\nVII\n\nMEANWHILE, a remarkable problem was absorbing the attention of the\nCatholic Church. Once more, for a moment, the eyes of all Christendom\nwere fixed upon Rome. The temporal Power of the Pope had now almost\nvanished; but, as his worldly dominions steadily diminished, the\nspiritual pretensions of the Holy Father no less steadily increased. For\nseven centuries the immaculate conception of the Virgin had been highly\nproblematical; Pio Nono spoke, and the doctrine became an article of\nfaith. A few years later, the Court of Rome took another step: a\nSyllabus Errorum was issued, in which all the favourite beliefs of the\nmodern world--the rights of democracies, the claims of science, the\nsanctity of free speech, the principles of toleration--were\ncategorically denounced, and their supporters abandoned to the Divine\nwrath.\n\nYet it was observed that the modern world proceeded as before. Something\nmore drastic appeared to be necessary--some bold and striking measure\nwhich should concentrate the forces of the faithful, and confound their\nenemies. The tremendous doctrine of Papal Infallibility, beloved of all\ngood Catholics, seemed to offer just the opening that was required. Let\nthat doctrine be proclaimed, with the assent of the whole Church, an\narticle of faith, and, in the face of such an affirmation, let the\nmodern world do its worst! Accordingly, a General Council--the first to\nbe held since the Council of Trent more than 300 years before--was\nsummoned to the Vatican, for the purpose, so it was announced, of\nproviding 'an adequate remedy to the disorders, intellectual and moral,\nof Christendom'. The programme might seem a large one, even for a\nGeneral Council; but everyone knew what it meant.\n\nEveryone, however, was not quite of one mind. There were those to whom\neven the mysteries of infallibility caused some searchings of heart. It\nwas true, no doubt, that Our Lord, by saying to Peter, 'Thou art Cephas,\nwhich is by interpretation a stone', thereby endowed that Apostle with\nthe supreme and full primacy and principality over the Universal\nCatholic Church; it was equally certain that Peter afterwards became the\nBishop of Rome; nor could it be doubted that the Roman Pontiff was his\nsuccessor. Thus it followed directly that the Roman Pontiff was the\nhead, heart, mind, and tongue of the Catholic Church; and moreover, it\nwas plain that when Our Lord prayed for Peter that his faith should not\nfail, that prayer implied the doctrine of Papal Infallibility. All these\nthings were obvious, and yet--and yet--might not the formal declaration\nof such truths in the year of his grace 1870 be, to say the least of it,\ninopportune? Might it not come as an offence, as a scandal even, to\nthose unacquainted with the niceties of Catholic dogma? Such were the\nuneasy reflections of grave and learned ecclesiastics and theologians in\nEngland, France, and Germany. Newman was more than usually upset;\nMonseigneur Dupanloup was disgusted; and Dr. Dollinger prepared himself\nfor resistance. It was clear that there would be a disaffected minority\nat the Council.\n\nCatholic apologists have often argued that the Pope's claim to\ninfallibility implies no more than the necessary claim of every ruler,\nof every government, to the right of supreme command. In England, for\ninstance, the Estates of the Realm exercise an absolute authority in\nsecular matters; no one questions this authority, no one suggests that\nit is absurd or exorbitant; in other words, by general consent the\nEstates of the Realm are, within their sphere, infallible. Why,\ntherefore, should the Pope, within his sphere--the sphere of the\nCatholic Church--be denied a similar infallibility? If there is nothing\nmonstrous in an Act of Parliament laying down what all men shall do, why\nshould there be anything monstrous in a Papal Encyclical laying down\nwhat all men shall believe? The argument is simple; in fact, it is too\nsimple; for it takes for granted the very question which is in dispute.\nIs there indeed no radical and essential distinction between supremacy\nand infallibility? Between the right of a Borough Council to regulate\nthe traffic and the right of the Vicar of Christ to decide upon the\nqualifications for Everlasting Bliss?\n\nThere is one distinction, at any rate, which is palpable: the decisions\nof a supreme authority can be altered; those of an infallible authority\ncannot. A Borough Council may change its traffic regulations at the next\nmeeting; but the Vicar of Christ, when in certain circumstances and with\ncertain precautions, he has once spoken, has expressed, for all the\nages, a part of the immutable, absolute, and eternal Truth. It is this\nthat makes the papal pretensions so extraordinary and so enormous. It is\nalso this that gives them their charm. Catholic apologists, when they\ntry to tone down those pretensions and to explain them away, forget that\nit is in their very exorbitance that their fascination lies. If the Pope\nwere indeed nothing more than a magnified Borough Councillor, we should\nhardly have heard so much of him. It is not because he satisfies the\nreason, but because he astounds it, that men abase themselves before the\nVicar of Christ.\n\nAnd certainly the doctrine of Papal Infallibility presents to the reason\na sufficiency of stumbling-blocks. In the fourteenth century, for\ninstance, the following case arose. John XXII asserted in his bull 'Cum\ninter nonnullos' that the doctrine of the poverty of Christ was\nheretical. Now, according to the light of reason, one of two things must\nfollow from this--either John XXII was himself a heretic, or he was no\nPope. For his predecessor, Nicholas III, had asserted in his bull 'Exiit\nqui seminat' that the doctrine of the poverty of Christ was the true\ndoctrine, the denial of which was heresy. Thus if John XXII was right,\nNicholas III was a heretic, and in that case Nicholas's nominations of\nCardinals were void, and the conclave which elected John was illegal--so\nthat John was no Pope, his nominations of Cardinals were void, and the\nwhole Papal succession vitiated. On the other hand, if John was\nwrong--well, he was a heretic; and the same inconvenient results\nfollowed. And, in either case, what becomes of Papal Infallibility?\n\nBut such crude and fundamental questions as these were not likely to\ntrouble the Council. The discordant minority took another line.\nInfallibility they admitted readily enough, the infallibility, that is\nto say, of the Church; what they shrank from was the pronouncement that\nthis infallibility was concentrated in the Bishop of Rome. They would\nnot actually deny that, as a matter of fact, it was so concentrated; but\nto declare that it was, to make the belief that it was an article of\nfaith--what could be more--it was their favourite expression--more\ninopportune? In truth, the Gallican spirit still lingered among them. At\nheart, they hated the autocracy of Rome--the domination of the\ncentralised Italian organisation over the whole vast body of the Church.\nThey secretly hankered, even at this late hour, after some form of\nconstitutional government, and they knew that the last faint vestige of\nsuch a dream would vanish utterly with the declaration of the\ninfallibility of the Pope. It did not occur to them, apparently, that a\nconstitutional Catholicism might be a contradiction in terms, and that\nthe Catholic Church, without the absolute dominion of the Pope, might\nresemble the play of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.\n\nPius IX himself was troubled by doubts. 'Before I was Pope,' he\nobserved, 'I believed in Papal Infallibility, now I feel it.' As for\nManning, his certainty was no less complete than his master's. Apart\nfrom the Holy Ghost, his appointment to the See of Westminster had been\ndue to Pio Nono's shrewd appreciation of the fact that he was the one\nman in England upon whose fidelity the Roman Government could absolutely\nrely. The voice which kept repeating 'Mettetelo li, mettetelo li' in his\nHoliness's ear, whether or not it was inspired by God, was certainly\ninspired by political sagacity. For now Manning was to show that he was\nnot unworthy of the trust which had been reposed in him. He flew to Rome\nin a whirlwind of Papal enthusiasm. On the way, in Paris, he stopped for\na moment to interview those two great props of French respectability, M.\nGuizot and M. Thiers. Both were careful not to commit themselves, but\nboth were exceedingly polite. 'I am awaiting your Council,' said M.\nGuizot, 'with great anxiety. It is the last great moral power and may\nrestore the peace of Europe.' M. Thiers delivered a brief harangue in\nfavour of the principles of the Revolution, which, he declared, were the\nvery marrow of all Frenchmen; yet, he added, he had always supported the\nTemporal Power of the Pope. 'Mais, M. Thiers,' said Manning, 'vous etes\neffectivement croyant.' 'En Dieu,' replied M. Thiers.\n\nThe Rome which Manning reached towards the close of 1869 was still the\nRome which, for so many centuries, had been the proud and visible apex,\nthe palpitating heart, the sacred sanctuary, of the most extraordinary\nmingling of spiritual and earthly powers that the world has ever known.\nThe Pope now, it is true, ruled over little more than the City\nitself--the Patrimony of St. Peter--and he ruled there less by the Grace\nof God than by the goodwill of Napoleon III; yet he was still a\nsovereign Prince, and Rome was still the capital of the Papal State; she\nwas not yet the capital of Italy. The last hour of this strange dominion\nhad almost struck. As if she knew that her doom was upon her, the\nEternal City arrayed herself to meet it in all her glory.\n\nThe whole world seemed to be gathered together within her walls. Her\nstreets were filled with crowned heads and Princes of the Church, great\nladies and great theologians, artists and friars, diplomats and\nnewspaper reporters. Seven hundred bishops were there from all the\ncorners of Christendom, and in all the varieties of ecclesiastical\nmagnificence in falling lace and sweeping purple and flowing violet\nveils. Zouaves stood in the colonnade of St Peter's, and Papal troops\nwere on the Quirinal. Cardinals passed, hatted and robed, in their\nenormous carriage of state, like mysterious painted idols. Then there\nwas a sudden hush: the crowd grew thicker and expectation filled, the\nair. Yes! it was he! He was coming! The Holy Father! But first there\nappeared, mounted on a white mule and clothed in a magenta mantle, a\ngrave dignitary bearing aloft a silver cross. The golden coach followed,\ndrawn by six horses gorgeously caparisoned, and within, the smiling\nwhite-haired Pio Nono, scattering his benedictions, while the multitude\nfell upon its knees as one man. Such were the daily spectacles of\ncoloured pomp and of antique solemnity, which so long as the sun was\nshining, at any rate--dazzled the onlooker into a happy forgetfulness of\nthe reverse side of the Papal dispensation--the nauseating filth of the\nhighways, the cattle stabled in the palaces of the great, and the fever\nflitting through the ghastly tenements of the poor.\n\nIn St. Peter's, the North Transept had been screened off; rows of wooden\nseats had been erected covered with Brussels carpet; and upon these\nseats sat each crowned with a white mitre, the 700 Bishops in Council.\nHere all day long rolled forth, in sonorous Latin, the interminable\nperiods of episcopal oratory; but it was not here that the issue of the\nCouncil was determined. The assembled Fathers might talk till the\nmarbles of St. Peter's themselves grew weary of the reverberations; the\nfate of the Church was decided in a very different manner--by little\nknots of influential persons meeting quietly of a morning in the back\nroom of some inconspicuous lodging-house, by a sunset rendezvous in the\nBorghese Gardens between a Cardinal and a Diplomatist by a whispered\nconference in an alcove at a Princess's evening party, with the gay\nworld chattering all about. And, of course, on such momentous occasions\nas these, Manning was in his element. None knew those difficult ropes\nbetter than he; none used them with a more serviceable and yet discreet\nalacrity. In every juncture he had the right word, or the right silence;\nhis influence ramified in all directions, from the Pope's audience\nchamber to the English Cabinet. 'Il Diavolo del Concilio' his enemies\ncalled him; and he gloried in the name.\n\nThe real crux of the position was less ecclesiastical than diplomatic.\nThe Papal Court, with its huge majority of Italian Bishops, could make\nsure enough, when it came to the point, of carrying its wishes through\nthe Council; what was far more dubious was the attitude of the foreign\nGovernments--especially those of France and England. The French\nGovernment dreaded a schism among its Catholic subjects; it disliked the\nprospect of an extension of the influence of the Pope over the mass of\nthe population of France; and, since the very existence of the last\nremnant of the Pope's Temporal Power depended upon the French army, it\nwas able to apply considerable pressure upon the Vatican. The interests\nof England were less directly involved, but it happened that at this\nmoment Mr. Gladstone was Prime Minister, and Mr. Gladstone entertained\nstrong views upon the Infallibility of the Pope. His opinions upon the\nsubject were in part the outcome of his friendship with Lord Acton, a\nhistorian to whom learning and judgment had not been granted in equal\nproportions, and who, after years of incredible and indeed well-nigh\nmythical research, had come to the conclusion that the Pope could err.\nIn this Mr. Gladstone entirely concurred, though he did not share the\nrest of his friend's theological opinions; for Lord Acton, while\nstraining at the gnat of Infallibility, had swallowed the camel of the\nRoman Catholic Faith. 'Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere?'\none cannot help asking, as one watched that laborious and scrupulous\nscholar, that lifelong enthusiast for liberty, that almost hysterical\nreviler of priesthood and persecution, trailing his learning so\ndiscrepantly along the dusty Roman way. But, there are some who know how\nto wear their Rome with a difference; and Lord Acton was one of these.\n\nHe was now engaged in fluttering like a moth round the Council and in\nwriting long letters to Mr. Gladstone, impressing upon him the gravity\nof the situation, and urging him to bring his influence to bear. If the\nDogma were carried--he declared, no man who accepted it could remain a\nloyal subject and Catholics would everywhere become 'irredeemable\nenemies of civil and religious liberty'. In these circumstances, was it\nnot plainly incumbent upon the English Government, involved as it was\nwith the powerful Roman Catholic forces in Ireland, to intervene? Mr.\nGladstone allowed himself to become convinced, and Lord Acton began to\nhope that his efforts would be successful. But, he had forgotten one\nelement in the situation; he had reckoned without the Archbishop of\nWestminster. The sharp nose of Manning sniffed out the whole intrigue.\nThough he despised Lord Acton almost as much as he disliked him--'such\nmen,' he said, 'are all vanity: they have the inflation of German\nprofessors, and the ruthless talk of undergraduates'--yet he realised\nclearly enough the danger of his correspondence with the Prime Minister,\nand immediately took steps to counteract it. There was a semi-official\nagent of the English Government in Rome, Mr. Odo Russell, and around him\nManning set to work to spin his spider's web of delicate and clinging\ndiplomacy. Preliminary politenesses were followed by long walks upon the\nPincio, and the gradual interchange of more and more important and\nconfidential communications. Soon poor Mr. Russell was little better\nthan a fly buzzing in gossamer. And Manning was careful to see that he\nbuzzed on the right note. In his dispatches to the Foreign Secretary,\nLord Clarendon, Mr. Russell explained in detail the true nature of the\nCouncil, that it was merely a meeting of a few Roman Catholic prelates\nto discuss some internal matters of Church discipline, that it had no\npolitical significance whatever, that the question of Infallibility,\nabout which there had been so much random talk, was a purely theological\nquestion, and that, whatever decision might be come to on the subject,\nthe position of Roman Catholics throughout the world would remain\nunchanged.\n\nWhether the effect of these affirmations upon Lord Clarendon was as\ngreat as Manning supposed is somewhat doubtful; but it is at any rate\ncertain that Mr. Gladstone failed to carry the Cabinet with him; and,\nwhen at last a proposal was definitely made that the English Government\nshould invite the Powers of Europe to intervene at the Vatican, it was\nrejected. Manning always believed that this was the direct result of Mr.\nRussell's dispatches, which had acted as an antidote to the poison of\nLord Acton's letters, and thus carried the day. If that was so, the\ndiscretion of biographers has not yet entirely lifted the veil from\nthese proceedings Manning had assuredly performed no small service for\nhis cause. Yet his modesty would not allow him to assume for himself a\ncredit which, after all, was due elsewhere; and when he told the story\nof those days, he would add, with more than wonted seriousness, 'It was\nby the Divine Will that the designs of His enemies were frustrated'.\n\nMeanwhile, in the North Transept of St. Peter's a certain amount of\npreliminary business had been carried through. Various miscellaneous\npoints in Christian doctrine had been satisfactorily determined. Among\nothers, the following Canons were laid down by the Fathers: 'If anyone\ndoes not accept for sacred and canonical the whole and every part of the\nBooks of Holy Scripture, or deny that they are divinely inspired, let\nhim be anathema.' 'If anyone says that miracles cannot be, and\ntherefore, the accounts of them, even those in Holy Scriptures must be\nassigned a place among fables and myths, or that the divine origin of\nthe Christian religion cannot rightly be proved from them, let him be\nanathema.' 'If anyone says that the doctrines of the Church can ever\nreceive a sense in accordance with the progress of science, other than\nthat sense which the Church has understood and still understands, let\nhim be anathema.' 'If anyone says that it is not possible, by the\nnatural light of human reason, to acquire a certain knowledge of the One\nand True God, let him be anathema.' In other words, it became an article\nof Faith that Faith was not necessary for a true knowledge of God.\nHaving disposed of these minor matters, the Fathers found themselves at\nlast approaching the great question of Infallibility.\n\nTwo main issues, it soon appeared, were before them: the. Pope's\ninfallibility was admitted, ostensibly at least, by all; what remained\nto be determined was: (1) whether the definition of the Pope's\nInfallibility was opportune, and (2) what the definition of the Pope's\nInfallibility was.\n\n(1) It soon became clear that the sense of the Council was\noverwhelmingly in favour of a definition. The Inopportunists were a\nsmall minority; they were outvoted, and they were obliged to give way.\nIt only remained, therefore, to come to a decision upon the second\nquestion--what the definition should actually be.\n\n(2) It now became the object of the Inopportunists to limit the scope of\nthe definition as much as possible, while the Infallibilists were no\nless eager to extend it. Now everyone, or nearly everyone, was ready to\nlimit the Papal Infallibility to pronouncements ex cathedra--that is to\nsay, to those made by the Pope in his capacity of Universal Doctor; but\nthis only served to raise the ulterior, the portentous, and indeed the\nreally crucial question--to WHICH of the Papal pronouncements ex\ncathedra did Infallibility adhere?\n\nThe discussions which followed were, naturally enough, numerous,\ncomplicated, and embittered, and in all of them Manning played a\nconspicuous part. For two months the Fathers deliberated; through fifty\nsessions they sought the guidance of the Holy Ghost. The wooden seats,\ncovered though they were with Brussels carpet, grew harder and harder;\nand still the mitred Councillors sat on. The Pope himself began to grow\nimpatient; for one thing, he declared, he was being ruined by the mere\nexpense of lodging and keeping the multitude of his adherents. 'Questi\ninfallibilisti mi faranno fallire', said his Holiness. At length it\nappeared that the Inopportunists were dragging out the proceedings in\nthe hope of obtaining an indefinite postponement. Then the authorities\nbegan to act; a bishop was shouted down, and the closure was brought\ninto operation. At this point the French Government, after long\nhesitation, finally decided to intervene, and Cardinal Antonelli was\ninformed that if the Definition was proceeded with, the French troops\nwould be withdrawn from Rome. But the astute Cardinal judged that he\ncould safely ignore the threat. He saw that Napoleon III was tottering\nto his fall and would never risk an open rupture with the Vatican.\nAccordingly, it was determined to bring the proceedings to a close by a\nfinal vote. Already the Inopportunists, seeing that the game was up, had\nshaken the dust of Rome from their feet. On July 18th, 1870, the Council\nmet for the last time. As the first of the Fathers stepped forward to\ndeclare his vote, a storm of thunder and lightning suddenly burst over\nSt. Peter's. All through the morning the voting continued, and every\nvote was accompanied by a flash and a roar from heaven. Both sides, with\nequal justice, claimed the portent as a manifestation of the Divine\nOpinion. When the votes were examined, it was found that 533 were in\nfavour of the proposed definition and two against it. Next day, war was\ndeclared between France and Germany, and a few weeks later the French\ntroops were withdrawn from Rome. Almost in the same moment, the\nsuccessor of St. Peter had lost his Temporal Power, and gained\nInfallibility.\n\nWhat the Council had done was merely to assent to a definition of the\ndogma of the Infallibility of the Roman Pontiff which Pius IX had\nissued, proprio motu, a few days before. The definition itself was\nperhaps somewhat less extreme than might have been expected. The Pope,\nit declared, is possessed, when he speaks ex cathedra, of 'that\ninfallibility with which the Redeemer willed that His Church should be\nendowed for defining doctrine regarding faith or morals'. Thus it became\na dogma of faith that a Papal definition regarding faith or morals is\ninfallible; but beyond that, both the Holy Father and the Council\nmaintained a judicious reserve. Over what OTHER matters besides faith\nand morals the Papal infallibility might or might not extend still\nremained in doubt. And there were further questions, no less serious, to\nwhich no decisive answer was then, or ever has been since, provided.\n\nHow was it to be determined, for instance, which particular Papal\ndecisions did in fact come within the scope of the definition? Who was\nto decide what was or was not a matter of faith or morals? Or precisely\nWHEN the Roman Pontiff was speaking ex cathedra? Was the famous Syllabus\nErrorum, for example, issued ex cathedra or not? Grave theologians have\nnever been able to make up their minds. Yet to admit doubts in such\nmatters as these is surely dangerous. 'In duty to our supreme pastoral\noffice,' proclaimed the Sovereign Pontiff, 'by the bowels of Christ we\nearnestly entreat all Christ's faithful people, and we also command them\nby the authority of God and our Saviour, that they study and labour to\nexpel and eliminate errors and display the light of the purest faith.'\nWell might the faithful study and labour to such ends! For, while the\noffence remained ambiguous, there was no ambiguity about the penalty.\nOne hair's-breadth from the unknown path of truth, one shadow of\nimpurity in the mysterious light of faith, and there shall be anathema!\nanathema! anathema! When the framers of such edicts called upon the\nbowels of Christ to justify them, might they not have done well to have\npaused a little, and to have called to mind the counsel of another\nsovereign ruler, though a heretic--Oliver Cromwell? 'Bethink ye, bethink\nye, in the bowels of Christ, that ye may be mistaken!'\n\nOne of the secondary results of the Council was the excommunication of\nDr. Dollinger, and a few more of the most uncompromising of the\nInopportunists. Among these, however, Lord Acton was not included.\nNobody ever discovered why. Was it because he was too important for the\nHoly See to care to interfere with him? Or was it because he was not\nimportant enough?\n\nAnother ulterior consequence was the appearance of a pamphlet by Mr.\nGladstone, entitled 'Vaticanism', in which the awful implications\ninvolved in the declaration of Infallibility were laid before the\nBritish Public. How was it possible, Mr. Gladstone asked, with all the\nfulminating accompaniments of his most agitated rhetoric, to depend\nhenceforward upon the civil allegiance of Roman Catholics? To this\nquestion the words of Cardinal Antonelli to the Austrian Ambassador\nmight have seemed a sufficient reply. 'There is a great difference,'\nsaid his Eminence, between theory and practice. No one will ever prevent\nthe Church from proclaiming the great principles upon which its Divine\nfabric is based; but, as regards the application of those sacred laws,\nthe Church, imitating the example of its Divine Founder, is inclined to\ntake into consideration the natural weaknesses of mankind.' And, in any\ncase, it was hard to see how the system of Faith, which had enabled Pope\nGregory XIII to effect, by the hands of English Catholics, a whole\nseries of attempts to murder Queen Elizabeth, can have been rendered a\nmuch more dangerous engine of disloyalty by the Definition of 1870. But\nsuch considerations failed to reassure Mr. Gladstone; the British Public\nwas of a like mind; and 145,000 copies of the pamphlet were sold within\ntwo months. Various replies appeared, and Manning was not behindhand.\nHis share in the controversy led to a curious personal encounter.\n\nHis conversion had come as a great shock to Mr. Gladstone. Manning had\nbreathed no word of its approach to his old and intimate friend, and\nwhen the news reached him, it seemed almost an act of personal injury.\n'I felt,' Mr. Gladstone said, 'as if Manning had murdered my mother by\nmistake.' For twelve years the two men did not meet, after which they\noccasionally saw each other and renewed their correspondence. This was\nthe condition of affairs when Mr. Gladstone published his pamphlet. As\nsoon as it appeared, Manning wrote a letter to the New York Herald,\ncontradicting its conclusions and declaring that its publication was\n'the first event that has overcast a friendship of forty-five years'.\nMr. Gladstone replied to this letter in a second pamphlet. At the close\nof his theological arguments, he added the following passage:\n\n'I feel it necessary, in concluding this answer, to state that\nArchbishop Manning has fallen into most serious inaccuracy in his letter\nof November 10th, wherein he describes 'my Expostulation as the first\nevent which has overcast a friendship of forty-five years. I allude to\nthe subject with regret; and without entering into details.'\n\nManning replied in a private letter:\n\n'My dear Gladstone,' he wrote, 'you say that I am in error in stating\nthat your former pamphlet is the first act which has overcast our\nfriendship.\n\n'If you refer to my act in 1851 in submitting to the Catholic Church, by\nwhich we were separated for some twelve years, I can understand it.\n\n'If you refer to any other act either on your part or mine I am not\nconscious of it, and would desire to know what it may be.\n\n'My act in 1851 may have overcast your friendship for me. It did not\novercast my friendship for you, as I think the last years have shown.\n\n'You will not, I hope, think me over-sensitive in asking for this\nexplanation. Believe me, yours affectionately,\n\n'H. E. M.'\n\n'My dear Archbishop Manning,' Mr. Gladstone answered, 'it did, I\nconfess, seem to me an astonishing error to state in public that a\nfriendship had not been overcast for forty-five years until now, which\nyour letter declares has been suspended as to all action for twelve ...\n\n'I wonder, too, at your forgetting that during the forty-five years I\nhad been charged by you with doing the work of the Antichrist in regard\nto the Temporal Power of the Pope.\n\n'Our differences, my dear Archbishop, are indeed profound. We refer\nthem, I suppose, in humble silence to a Higher Power ... You assured me\nonce of your prayers at all and at the most solemn time. I received that\nassurance with gratitude, and still cherish it. As and when they move\nupwards, there is a meeting-point for those whom a chasm separates\nbelow. I remain always, affectionately yours,\n\n'W. E. GLADSTONE.'\n\nSpeaking of this correspondence in after years, Cardinal Manning said:\n'From the way in which Mr. Gladstone alluded to the overcasting of our\nfriendship, people might have thought that I had picked his pocket.'\n\n\nVIII\n\nIN 1875, Manning's labours received their final reward: he was made a\nCardinal. His long and strange career, with its high hopes, its bitter\ndisappointments, its struggles, its renunciations, had come at last to\nfruition in a Princedom of the Church.\n\n'Ask in faith and in perfect confidence,' he himself once wrote, and God\nwill give us what we ask. You may say, \"But do you mean that He will\ngive us the very thing?\" That, God has not said. God has said that He\nwill give you whatsoever you ask; but the form in which it will come,\nand the time in which He will give it, He keeps in His own power.\nSometimes our prayers are answered in the very things which we put from\nus; sometimes it may be a chastisement, or a loss, or a visitation\nagainst which our hearts rise, and we seem to see that God has not only\nforgotten us, but has begun to deal with us in severity. Those very\nthings are the answers to our prayers. He knows what we desire, and He\ngives us the things for which we ask; but in the form which His own\nDivine Wisdom sees to be best.'\n\nThere was one to whom Manning's elevation would no doubt have given a\npeculiar satisfaction--his old friend Monsignor Talbot. But this was not\nto be. That industrious worker in the cause of Rome had been removed\nsome years previously to a sequestered home at Passy, whose padded walls\nwere impervious to the rumours of the outer world. Pius IX had been much\nafflicted by this unfortunate event; he had not been able to resign\nhimself to the loss of his secretary, and he had given orders that\nMonsignor Talbot's apartment in the Vatican should be preserved\nprecisely as he had left it, in case of his return. But Monsignor Talbot\nnever returned. Manning's feelings upon the subject appear to have been\nless tender than the Pope's. In all his letters, in all his papers, in\nall his biographical memoranda, not a word of allusion is to be found to\nthe misfortune, nor to the death, of the most loyal of his adherents.\nMonsignor Talbot's name disappears suddenly and for ever--like a stone\ncast into the waters.\n\nManning was now an old man, and his outward form had assumed that\nappearance of austere asceticism which is, perhaps, the one thing\nimmediately suggested by his name to the ordinary Englishman. The spare\nand stately form, the head--massive, emaciated, terrible--with the great\nnose, the glittering eyes, and the mouth drawn back and compressed into\nthe grim rigidities of age, self-mortification, and authority--such is\nthe vision that still lingers in the public mind--the vision which,\nactual and palpable like some embodied memory of the Middle Ages, used\nto pass and repass, less than a generation since, through the streets of\nLondon. For the activities of this extraordinary figure were great and\nvaried. He ruled his diocese with the despotic zeal of a born\nadministrator. He threw himself into social work of every kind; he\norganised charities, he lectured on temperance; he delivered innumerable\nsermons; he produced an unending series of devotional books. And he\nbrooked no brother near the throne: Newman languished in Birmingham; and\neven the Jesuits trembled and obeyed.\n\nNor was it only among his own community that his energy and his\nexperience found scope. He gradually came to play an important part in\npublic affairs, upon questions of labour, poverty, and education. He sat\non Royal Commissions and corresponded with Cabinet Ministers. At last,\nno philanthropic meeting at the Guildhall was considered complete\nwithout the presence of Cardinal Manning. A special degree of precedence\nwas accorded to him. Though the rank of a Cardinal-Archbishop is\nofficially unknown in England, his name appeared in public documents--as\na token, it must be supposed, of personal consideration--above the names\nof peers and bishops, and immediately below that of the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn his private life he was secluded. The ambiguities of his social\nposition, and his desire to maintain intact the peculiar eminence of his\noffice, combined to hold him aloof from the ordinary gatherings of\nsociety, though on the rare occasions of his appearance among\nfashionable and exalted persons, he carried all before him. His\nfavourite haunt was the Athenaeum Club, where he sat scanning the\nnewspapers, or conversing with the old friends of former days. He was a\nmember, too, of that distinguished body, the Metaphysical Society, which\nmet once a month during the palmy years of the seventies to discuss, in\nstrict privacy, the fundamental problems of the destiny of man.\n\nAfter a comfortable dinner at the Grosvenor Hotel, the Society, which\nincluded Professor Huxley and Professor Tyndall, Mr. John Morley and Sir\nJames Stephen, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Tennyson, and Dean Church, would\ngather around to hear and discuss a paper read by one of the members\nupon such questions as: 'What is death?' 'Is God unknowable?' or 'The\nnature of the Moral Principle'. Sometimes, however, the speculations of\nthe Society ranged in other directions.\n\n'I think the paper that interested me most of all that were ever read at\nour meetings,' says Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff, 'was one on\n\"Wherein consists the special beauty of imperfection and decay?\" in\nwhich were propounded the questions \"Are not ruins recognised and felt\nto be more beautiful than perfect structures? Why are they so? Ought\nthey to be so?'\n\n'Unfortunately, however, the answers given to these questions by the\nMetaphysical Society have not been recorded for the instruction of\nmankind.\n\nManning read several papers, and Professor Huxley and Mr. John Morley\nlistened with attention while he expressed his views upon 'The Soul\nbefore and after Death', or explained why it is 'That legitimate\nAuthority is an Evidence of Truth'. Yet, somehow or other, his Eminence\nnever felt quite at ease in these assemblies; he was more at home with\naudiences of a different kind; and we must look in other directions for\nthe free and full manifestation of his speculative gifts.\n\nIn a series of lectures, for instance, delivered in 1861--it was the\nfirst year of the unification of Italy--upon 'The Present Crisis of the\nHoly See, tested by prophecy', we catch some glimpses of the kind of\nproblems which were truly congenial to his mind.\n\n'In the following pages,' he said, 'I have endeavoured, but for so great\na subject most insufficiently, to show that what is passing in our times\nis the prelude of the antichristian period of the final dethronement of\nChristendom, and of the restoration of society without God in the\nworld.' 'My intention is,' he continued, 'to examine the present\nrelation of the Church to the civil powers of the world by the light of\na prophecy recorded by St Paul.'\n\nThis prophecy (2 Thess. ii 3 to 11) is concerned with the coming of the\nAntichrist, and the greater part of the lectures is devoted to a minute\nexamination of this subject. There is no passage in Scripture, Manning\npointed out, relating to the coming of Christ more explicit and express\nthan those foretelling Antichrist; it therefore behoved the faithful to\nconsider the matter more fully than they are wont to do. In the first\nplace, Antichrist is a person. 'To deny the personality of Antichrist is\nto deny the plain testimony of Holy Scripture.' And we must remember\nthat 'it is a law of Holy Scripture that when persons are prophesied of,\npersons appear'.\n\nAgain, there was every reason to believe that Antichrist, when he did\nappear, would turn out to be a Jew.\n\n'Such was the opinion of St. Irenaeus, St. Jerome, and of the author of\nthe work De Consummatione Mundi, ascribed to St. Hippolytus, and of a\nwriter of a Commentary on the Epistle to the Thessalonians, ascribed to\nSt. Ambrose, of many others, who said that he will be of the tribe of\nDan: as, for instance, St. Gregory the Great, Theodoret, Aretas of\nCaesarea, and many more. Such also is the opinion of Bellarmine, who\ncalls it certain. Lessius affirms that the Fathers, with unanimous\nconsent, teach as undoubted that Antichrist will be a Jew. Ribera\nrepeats the same opinion, and adds that Aretas, St. Bede, Haymo, St.\nAnselm, and Rupert affirm that for this reason the tribe of Dan is not\nnumbered among those who are sealed in the Apocalypse ... Now, I think\nno one can consider the dispersion and providential preservation of the\nJews among all the nations of the world and the indestructible vitality\nof their race without believing that they are reserved for some future\naction of His judgment and Grace. And this is foretold again and again\nin the New Testament.'\n\n'Our Lord,' continued Manning, widening the sweep of his speculations,\n'has said of these latter times: \"There shall arise false Christs and\nfalse prophets, insomuch as to deceive even the elect\"; that is, they\nshall not be deceived; but those who have lost faith in the Incarnation,\nsuch as humanitarians, rationalists, and pantheists, may well be\ndeceived by any person of great political power and success, who should\nrestore the Jews to their own land, and people Jerusalem once more with\nthe sons of the Patriarchs. And, there is nothing in the political\naspect of the world which renders such a combination impossible; indeed,\nthe state of Syria, and the tide of European diplomacy, which 'is\ncontinually moving eastward, render such an event within a reasonable\nprobability.'\n\nThen Manning threw out a bold suggestion. 'A successful medium,' he\nsaid, 'might well pass himself off by his preternatural endowments as\nthe promised Messiahs.'\n\nManning went on to discuss the course of events which would lead to the\nfinal catastrophe. But this subject, he confessed,\n\n'deals with agencies so transcendent and mysterious, that all I shall\nventure to do will be to sketch in outline what the broad and luminous\nprophecies, especially of the Book of Daniel and the Apocalypse, set\nforth without attempting to enter into minute details, which can only be\ninterpreted by the event'.\n\nWhile applauding his modesty, we need follow Manning no further in his\ncommentary upon those broad and luminous works; except to observe that\n'the apostasy of the City of Rome from the Vicar of Christ and its\ndestruction by the Antichrist' was, in his opinion, certain. Nor was he\nwithout authority for this belief. For it was held by 'Malvenda, who\nwrites expressly on the subject', and who, besides, 'states as the\nopinion of Ribera, Gaspar Melus, Viegas, Suarez, Bellarmine, and Bosius\nthat Rome shall apostatise from the faith'.\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE death of Pius IX brought to Manning a last flattering testimony of\nthe confidence with which he was regarded at the Court of Rome. In one\nof the private consultations preceding the Conclave, a Cardinal\nsuggested that Manning should succeed to the Papacy. He replied that he\nwas unfit for the position, because it was essential for the interests\nof the Holy See that the next Pope should be an Italian. The suggestion\nwas pressed, but Manning held firm. Thus it happened that the Triple\nTiara seemed to come, for a moment, within the grasp of the late\nArchdeacon of Chichester; and the cautious hand refrained.\n\nLeo XIII was elected, and there was a great change in the policy of the\nVatican. Liberalism became the order of the day. And now at last the\nopportunity seemed ripe for an act which, in the opinion of the majority\nof English Catholics, had long been due--the bestowal of some mark of\nrecognition from the Holy See upon the labours and the sanctity of\nFather Newman. It was felt that a Cardinal's hat was the one fitting\nreward for such a life, and accordingly the Duke of Norfolk,\nrepresenting the Catholic laity of England, visited Manning, and\nsuggested that he should forward the proposal to the Vatican. Manning\nagreed, and then there followed a curious series of incidents--the last\nencounter in the jarring lives of those two men. A letter was drawn up\nby Manning for the eye of the Pope, embodying the Duke of Norfolk's\nproposal; but there was an unaccountable delay in the transmission of\nthis letter; months passed, and it had not reached the Holy Father. The\nwhole matter would, perhaps, have dropped out of sight and been\nforgotten, in a way which had become customary when honours for Newman\nwere concerned, had not the Duke of Norfolk himself, when he was next in\nRome, ventured to recommend to Leo XIII that Dr. Newman should be made a\nCardinal. His Holiness welcomed the proposal; but, he said, he could do\nnothing until he knew the views of Cardinal Manning. Thereupon, the Duke\nof Norfolk wrote to Manning, explaining what had occurred; shortly\nafterwards, Manning's letter of recommendation, after a delay of six\nmonths, reached the Pope, and the offer of a Cardinalate was immediately\ndispatched to Newman.\n\nBut the affair was not yet over. The offer had been made; would it be\naccepted? There was one difficulty in the way. Newman was now an infirm\nold man of seventy-eight; and it is a rule that all Cardinals who are\nnot also diocesan Bishops or Archbishops reside, as a matter of course,\nat Rome. The change would have been impossible for one of his years--for\none, too, whose whole life was now bound up with the Oratory at\nBirmingham. But, of course, there was nothing to prevent His Holiness\nfrom making an exception in Newman's case, and allowing him to end his\ndays in England. Yet how was Newman himself to suggest this? The offer\nof the Hat had come to him as an almost miraculous token of renewed\nconfidence, of ultimate reconciliation. The old, long, bitter\nestrangement was ended at last. 'The cloud is lifted from me for ever!'\nhe exclaimed when the news reached him. It would be melancholy indeed if\nthe cup were now to be once more dashed from his lips and he was obliged\nto refuse the signal honour. In his perplexity he went to the Bishop of\nBirmingham and explained the whole situation. The Bishop assured him\nthat all would be well; that he himself would communicate with the\nauthorities, and put the facts of the case before them. Accordingly,\nwhile Newman wrote formally refusing the Hat, on the ground of his\nunwillingness to leave the Oratory, the Bishop wrote two letters to\nManning, one official and one private, in which the following passages\noccurred:\n\n'Dr. Newman has far too humble and delicate a mind to dream of thinking\nor saying anything which would look like hinting at any kind of terms\nwith the Sovereign Pontiff.... I think, however, that I ought to express\nmy own sense of what Dr. Newman's dispositions are, and that it will be\nexpected of me ... I am thoroughly confident that nothing stands in the\nway of his most grateful acceptance, except what he tells me greatly\ndistresses him--namely, the having to leave the Oratory at a critical\nperiod of its existence, and the impossibility of his beginning a new\nlife at his advanced age.'\n\nAnd in his private letter the Bishop said:\n\n'Dr. Newman is very much aged, and softened with age and the trials he\nhas had, especially the loss of his two brethren, St. John and Caswall;\nhe can never refer to these losses without weeping and becoming\nspeechless for a time. He is very much affected by the Pope's kindness\nand would, I know, like to receive the great honour offered him, but\nfeels the whole difficulty at his age of changing his life or having to\nleave the Oratory--which I am sure he could not do. If the Holy Father\nthinks well to confer on him the dignity, leaving him where he is, I\nknow how immensely he would be gratified, and you will know how\ngenerally the conferring on him the Cardinalate will be applauded.'\n\nThese two letters, together with Newman's refusal, reached Manning as he\nwas on the point of starting for Rome. After he had left England, the\nfollowing statement appeared in \"The Times\":\n\n'Pope Leo XIII has intimated his desire to raise Dr. Newman to the rank\nof Cardinal, but with expressions of deep respect for the Holy See, Dr.\nNewman has excused himself from accepting the Purple.'\n\nWhen Newman's eyes fell upon the announcement, he realised at once that\na secret and powerful force was working against him. He trembled, as he\nhad so often trembled before; and certainly the danger was not\nimaginary. In the ordinary course of things, how could such a paragraph\nhave been inserted without his authority? And consequently, did it not\nconvey to the world, not only an absolute refusal which he had never\nintended, but a wish on his part to emphasise publicly his rejection of\nthe proffered honour? Did it not imply that he had lightly declined a\nproposal for which in reality he was deeply thankful? And when the fatal\nparagraph was read in Rome, might it not actually lead to the offer of\nthe Cardinalate being finally withheld?\n\nIn great agitation, Newman appealed to the Duke of Norfolk.\n\n'As to the statement,' he wrote, 'of my refusing a Cardinal's Hat, which\nis in the papers, you must not believe it, for this reason:\n\n'Of course, it implies that an offer has been made me, and I have sent\nan answer to it. Now I have ever understood that it is a point of\npropriety and honour to consider such communications sacred. This\nstatement, therefore, cannot come from me. Nor could it come from Rome,\nfor it was made public before my answer got to Rome.\n\n'It could only come, then, from someone who not only read my letter,\nbut, instead of leaving to the Pope to interpret it, took upon himself\nto put an interpretation upon it, and published that interpretation to\nthe world.\n\n'A private letter, addressed to Roman Authorities, is interpreted on its\nway and published in the English papers. How is it possible that anyone\ncan have done this?'\n\nThe crushing indictment pointed straight at Manning. And it was true.\nManning had done the impossible deed. Knowing what he did, with the\nBishop of Birmingham's two letters in his pocket, he had put it about\nthat Newman had refused the Hat. But a change had come over the spirit\nof the Holy See. Things were not as they had once been: Monsignor Talbot\nwas at Passy, and Pio Nono was--where? The Duke of Norfolk intervened\nonce again; Manning was profuse in his apologies for having\nmisunderstood Newman's intentions, and hurried to the Pope to rectify\nthe error. Without hesitation, the Sovereign Pontiff relaxed the rule of\nRoman residence, and Newman became a Cardinal.\n\nHe lived to enjoy his glory for more than ten years. Since he rarely\nleft the Oratory, and since Manning never visited Birmingham, the two\nCardinals met only once or twice. After one of these occasions, on\nreturning to the Oratory, Cardinal Newman said, 'What do you think\nCardinal Manning did to me? He kissed me!'\n\nOn Newman's death, Manning delivered a funeral oration, which opened\nthus:\n\n'We have lost our greatest witness for the Faith, and we are all poorer\nand lower by the loss.\n\n'When these tidings came to me, my first thought was this, in what way\ncan I, once more, show my love and veneration for my brother and friend\nof more than sixty years?'\n\nIn private, however, the surviving Cardinal's tone was apt to be more\n... direct. 'Poor Newman!' he once exclaimed in a moment of genial\nexpansion. 'Poor Newman! He was a great hater!'\n\n\nX\n\nIN that gaunt and gloomy building--more like a barracks than an\nEpiscopal palace--Archbishop's House, Westminster, Manning's existence\nstretched itself out into an extreme old age. As his years increased,\nhis activities, if that were possible, increased too. Meetings,\nmissions, lectures, sermons, articles, interviews, letters--such things\ncame upon him in redoubled multitudes, and were dispatched with an\nunrelenting zeal. But this was not all; with age, he seemed to acquire\nwhat was almost a new fervour, an unaccustomed, unexpected, freeing of\nthe spirit, filling him with preoccupations which he had hardly felt\nbefore. 'They say I am ambitious,' he noted in his Diary, 'but do I rest\nin my ambition?'\n\nNo, assuredly he did not rest; but he worked now with no arriere pensee\nfor the greater glory of God. A kind of frenzy fell upon him. Poverty,\ndrunkenness, vice, all the horrors and terrors of our civilisation\nseized upon his mind, and urged him forward to new fields of action and\nnew fields of thought. The temper of his soul assumed almost a\nrevolutionary cast. 'I am a Mosaic Radical,' he exclaimed; and, indeed,\nin the exaltation of his energies, the incoherence of his conceptions,\nthe democratic urgency of his desires, combined with his awe-inspiring\naspect and his venerable age, it was easy enough to trace the mingled\nqualities of the patriarch, the prophet, and the demagogue. As, in his\nsoiled and shabby garments, the old man harangued the crowds of\nBermondsey or Peckham upon the virtues of Temperance, assuring them,\nwith all the passion of conviction, as a final argument, that the\nmajority of the Apostles were total abstainers, this Prince of the\nChurch might have passed as a leader of the Salvation Army. His\npopularity was immense, reaching its height during the great Dock\nStrikes of 1889, when, after the victory of the men was assured, Manning\nwas able, by his persuasive eloquence and the weight of his character,\nto prevent its being carried to excess. After other conciliators--among\nwhom was the Bishop of London--had given up the task in disgust, the\noctogenarian Cardinal worked on with indefatigable resolution. At last,\nlate at night, in the schools in Kirby Street, Bermondsey, he rose to\naddress the strikers. An enthusiastic eye-witness has described the\nscene:\n\n'Unaccustomed tears glistened in the eyes of his rough and work-stained\nhearers as the Cardinal raised his hand and solemnly urged them not to\nprolong one moment more than they could help the perilous uncertainty\nand the sufferings of their wives and children. Just above his uplifted\nhand was a figure of the Madonna and Child; and some among the men tell\nhow a sudden light seemed to swim around it as the speaker pleaded for\nthe women and children. When he sat down all in the room knew that he\nhad won the day, and that, so far as the Strike Committee was concerned,\nthe matter was at an end.'\n\nIn those days, there were strange visitors at the Archbishop's House.\nCareful priests and conscientious secretaries wondered what the world\nwas coming to when they saw labour leaders like Mr. John Burns and Mr.\nBen Tillett, and land-reformers like Mr. Henry George, being ushered\ninto the presence of his Eminence. Even the notorious Mr. Stead\nappeared, and his scandalous paper with its unspeakable revelations lay\nupon the Cardinal's table. This proved too much for one of the faithful\ntonsured dependents of the place, and he ventured to expostulate with\nhis master. But he never did so again.\n\nWhen the guests were gone, and the great room was empty, the old man\nwould draw himself nearer to the enormous fire, and review once more,\nfor the thousandth time, the long adventure of his life. He would bring\nout his diaries and his memoranda, he would rearrange his notes, he\nwould turn over again the yellow leaves of faded correspondences;\nseizing his pen, he would pour out his comments and reflections, and\nfill, with an extraordinary solicitude, page after page with\nelucidations, explanations, justifications, of the vanished incidents of\na remote past. He would snip with scissors the pages of ancient\njournals, and with delicate ecclesiastical fingers, drop unknown\nmysteries into the flames.\n\nSometimes he would turn to the four red folio scrapbooks with their\ncollection of newspaper cuttings, concerning himself, over a period of\nthirty years. Then the pale cheeks would flush and the close-drawn lips\nwould grow even more menacing than before. 'Stupid, mulish malice,' he\nwould note. 'Pure lying--conscious, deliberate and designed.'\n'Suggestive lying. Personal animosity is at the bottom of this.'\n\nAnd then he would suddenly begin to doubt. After all, where was he? What\nhad he accomplished? Had any of it been worthwhile? Had he not been out\nof the world all his life! Out of the world!\n\n'Croker's \"Life and Letters\", and Hayward's \"Letters\",' he notes, 'are\nso full of politics, literature, action, events, collision of mind with\nmind, and that with such a multitude of men in every state of life, that\nwhen I look back, it seems as if I had been simply useless.'\n\nAnd again, 'The complete isolation and exclusion from the official life\nof England in which I have lived, makes me feel as if I had done\nnothing'. He struggled to console himself with the reflexion that all\nthis was only 'the natural order'. 'If the natural order is moved by the\nsupernatural order, then I may not have done nothing. Fifty years of\nwitness for God and His Truth, I hope, has not been in vain.' But the\nsame thoughts recurred. 'In reading Macaulay's life I had a haunting\nfeeling that his had been a life of public utility and mine a vita\numbratilis, a life in the shade.' Ah! it was God's will. 'Mine has been\na life of fifty years out of the world as Gladstone's has been in it.\nThe work of his life in this world is manifest. I hope mine may be in\nthe next. I suppose our Lord called me out of the world because He saw\nthat I should lose my soul in it.' Clearly, that was the explanation.\n\nAnd yet he remained sufficiently in the world to discharge with absolute\nefficiency the complex government of his diocese almost up to the last\nmoment of his existence. Though his bodily strength gradually ebbed, the\nvigour of his mind was undismayed. At last, supported by cushions, he\ncontinued, by means of a dictated correspondence, to exert his\naccustomed rule. Only occasionally would he lay aside his work to plunge\ninto the yet more necessary duties of devotion. Never again would he\npreach; never again would he put into practice those three salutary\nrules of his in choosing a subject for a sermon: '(1) asking God to\nguide the choice; (2) applying the matter to myself; (3) making the sign\nof the cross on my head and heart and lips in honour of the Sacred\nMouth;' but he could still pray; he could turn especially to the Holy\nGhost.\n\n'A very simple but devout person,' he wrote in one of his latest\nmemoranda, 'asked me why in my first volume of sermons I said so little\nabout the Holy Ghost. I was not aware of it; but I found it to be true.\nI at once resolved that I would make a reparation every day of my life\nto the Holy Ghost. This I have never failed to do to this day. To this I\nowe the light and faith which brought me into the truefold. I bought all\nthe books I could about the Holy Ghost. I worked out the truths about\nHis personality, His presence, and His office. This made me understand\nthe last paragraph in the Apostles' Creed, and made me a Catholic\nChristian.'\n\nSo, though Death came slowly, struggling step by step with that bold and\ntenacious spirit, when he did come at last the Cardinal was ready. Robed\nin his archiepiscopal vestments, his rochet, his girdle, and his\nmozzetta, with the scarlet biretta on his head, and the pectoral cross\nupon his breast, he made his solemn Profession of Faith in the Holy\nRoman Church. A crowd of lesser dignitaries, each in the garments of his\noffice, attended the ceremonial. The Bishop of Salford held up the\nPontificale and the Bishop of Amycla bore the wax taper. The provost of\nWestminster, on his knees, read aloud the Profession of Faith,\nsurrounded by the Canons of the Diocese. Towards those who gathered\nabout him, the dying man was still able to show some signs of\nrecognition, and even, perhaps, of affection; yet it seemed that his\nchief preoccupation, up to the very end, was with his obedience to the\nrules prescribed by the Divine Authority. 'I am glad to have been able\nto do everything in due order', were among his last words. 'Si fort\nqu'on soit,' says one of the profoundest of the observers of the human\nheart, 'on peut eprouver le besoin de s'incliner devant quelqu'un ou\nquelque chose. S'incliner devant Dieu, c'est toujours le moins\nhumiliant.'\n\nManning died on January 14th, 1892, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.\nA few days later Mr. Gladstone took occasion, in a letter to a friend,\nto refer to his relations with the late Cardinal. Manning's conversion\nwas, he said,\n\n'altogether the severest blow that ever befell me. In a late letter the\nCardinal termed it a quarrel, but in my reply I told him it was not a\nquarrel, but a death; and that was the truth. Since then there have been\nvicissitudes. But I am quite certain that to the last his personal\nfeelings never changed; and I believe also that he kept a promise made\nin 1851, to remember me before God at the most solemn moments; a promise\nwhich I greatly valued. The whole subject is to me at once of extreme\ninterest and of considerable restraint.'\n\n'His reluctance to die,' concluded Mr. Gladstone, 'may be explained by\nan intense anxiety to complete unfulfilled service.'\n\nThe funeral was the occasion of a popular demonstration such as has\nrarely been witnessed in the streets of London. The route of the\nprocession was lined by vast crowds of working people, whose\nimaginations, in some instinctive manner, had been touched. Many who had\nhardly seen him declared that in Cardinal Manning they had lost their\nbest friend. Was it the magnetic vigour of the dead man's spirit that\nmoved them? Or was it his valiant disregard of common custom and those\nconventional reserves and poor punctilios which are wont to hem about\nthe great? Or was it something untameable in his glances and in his\ngestures? Or was it, perhaps, the mysterious glamour lingering about\nhim, of the antique organisation of Rome? For whatever cause, the mind\nof the people had been impressed; and yet, after all, the impression was\nmore acute than lasting. The Cardinal's memory is a dim thing today. And\nhe who descends into the crypt of that Cathedral which Manning never\nlived to see, will observe, in the quiet niche with the sepulchral\nmonument, that the dust lies thick on the strange, the incongruous, the\nalmost impossible object which, with its elaborations of dependent\ntassels, hangs down from the dim vault like some forlorn and forgotten\ntrophy--the Hat.\n\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n  E.

The Story of the Dockers' Strike.\n\n\n\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\n\nEVERY one knows the popular conception of Florence Nightingale. The\nsaintly, self-sacrificing woman, the delicate maiden of high degree who\nthrew aside the pleasures of a life of ease to succour the afflicted;\nthe Lady with the Lamp, gliding through the horrors of the hospital at\nScutari, and consecrating with the radiance of her goodness the dying\nsoldier's couch. The vision is familiar to all--but the truth was\ndifferent. The Miss Nightingale of fact was not as facile as fancy\npainted her. She worked in another fashion and towards another end; she\nmoved under the stress of an impetus which finds no place in the popular\nimagination. A Demon possessed her. Now demons, whatever else they may\nbe, are full of interest. And so it happens that in the real Miss\nNightingale there was more that was interesting than in the legendary\none; there was also less that was agreeable.\n\nHer family was extremely well-to-do, and connected by marriage with a\nspreading circle of other well-to-do families. There was a large country\nhouse in Derbyshire; there was another in the New Forest; there were\nMayfair rooms for the London season and all its finest parties; there\nwere tours on the Continent with even more than the usual number of\nItalian operas and of glimpses at the celebrities of Paris. Brought up\namong such advantages, it was only natural to suppose that Florence\nwould show a proper appreciation of them by doing her duty in that state\nof life unto which it had pleased God to call her--in other words, by\nmarrying, after a fitting number of dances and dinner-parties, an\neligible gentleman, and living happily ever afterwards. Her sister, her\ncousins, all the young ladies of her acquaintance, were either getting\nready to do this or had already done it.\n\nIt was inconceivable that Florence should dream of anything else; yet\ndream she did. Ah! To do her duty in that state of life unto which it\nhad pleased God to call her! Assuredly, she would not be behindhand in\ndoing her duty; but unto what state of life HAD it pleased God to call\nher? That was the question. God's calls are many, and they are strange.\nUnto what state of life had it pleased Him to call Charlotte Corday, or\nElizabeth of Hungary? What was that secret voice in her ear, if it was\nnot a call? Why had she felt, from her earliest years, those mysterious\npromptings towards ... she hardly knew what, but certainly towards\nsomething very different from anything around her? Why, as a child in\nthe nursery, when her sister had shown a healthy pleasure in tearing her\ndolls to pieces, had SHE shown an almost morbid one in sewing them up\nagain? Why was she driven now to minister to the poor in their cottages,\nto watch by sick-beds, to put her dog's wounded paw into elaborate\nsplints as if it was a human being? Why was her head filled with queer\nimaginations of the country house at Embley turned, by some enchantment,\ninto a hospital, with herself as matron moving about among the beds? Why\nwas even her vision of heaven itself filled with suffering patients to\nwhom she was being useful? So she dreamed and wondered, and, taking out\nher diary, she poured into it the agitations of her soul. And then the\nbell rang, and it was time to go and dress for dinner.\n\nAs the years passed, a restlessness began to grow upon her. She was\nunhappy, and at last she knew it. Mrs. Nightingale, too, began to notice\nthat there was something wrong. It was very odd--what could be the\nmatter with dear Flo? Mr. Nightingale suggested that a husband might be\nadvisable; but the curious thing was that she seemed to take no interest\nin husbands. And with her attractions, and her accomplishments, too!\nThere was nothing in the world to prevent her making a really brilliant\nmatch. But no! She would think of nothing but how to satisfy that\nsingular craving of hers to be DOING something. As if there was not\nplenty to do in any case, in the ordinary way, at home. There was the\nchina to look after, and there was her father to be read to after\ndinner. Mrs. Nightingale could not understand it; and then one day her\nperplexity was changed to consternation and alarm. Florence announced an\nextreme desire to go to Salisbury Hospital for several months as a\nnurse; and she confessed to some visionary plan of eventually setting up\nin a house of her own in a neighbouring village, and there founding\n'something like a Protestant Sisterhood, without vows, for women of\neducated feelings'. The whole scheme was summarily brushed aside as\npreposterous; and Mrs. Nightingale, after the first shock of terror, was\nable to settle down again more or less comfortably to her embroidery.\nBut Florence, who was now twenty-five and felt that the dream of her\nlife had been shattered, came near to desperation.\n\nAnd, indeed, the difficulties in her path were great. For not only was\nit an almost unimaginable thing in those days for a woman of means to\nmake her own way in the world and to live in independence, but the\nparticular profession for which Florence was clearly marked out both by\nher instincts and her capacities was at that time a peculiarly\ndisreputable one. A 'nurse' meant then a coarse old woman, always\nignorant, usually dirty, often brutal, a Mrs. Gamp, in bunched-up sordid\ngarments, tippling at the brandy bottle or indulging in worse\nirregularities. The nurses in the hospitals were especially notorious\nfor immoral conduct; sobriety was almost unknown among them; and they\ncould hardly be trusted to carry out the simplest medical duties.\n\nCertainly, things HAVE changed since those days; and that they have\nchanged is due, far more than to any other human being, to Miss\nNightingale herself. It is not to be wondered at that her parents should\nhave shuddered at the notion of their daughter devoting her life to such\nan occupation. 'It was as if,' she herself said afterwards, 'I had\nwanted to be a kitchen-maid.' Yet the want, absurd and impracticable as\nit was, not only remained fixed immovably in her heart, but grew in\nintensity day by day. Her wretchedness deepened into a morbid\nmelancholy. Everything about her was vile, and she herself, it was\nclear, to have deserved such misery, was even viler than her\nsurroundings. Yes, she had sinned--'standing before God's judgment\nseat'. 'No one,' she declared, 'has so grieved the Holy Spirit'; of that\nshe was quite certain. It was in vain that she prayed to be delivered\nfrom vanity and hypocrisy, and she could not bear to smile or to be gay,\n'because she hated God to hear her laugh, as if she had not repented of\nher sin'.\n\nA weaker spirit would have been overwhelmed by the load of such\ndistresses--would have yielded or snapped. But this extraordinary young\nwoman held firm, and fought her way to victory. With an amazing\npersistency, during the eight years that followed her rebuff over\nSalisbury Hospital, she struggled and worked and planned. While\nsuperficially she was carrying on the life of a brilliant girl in high\nsociety, while internally she was a prey to the tortures of regret and\nof remorse, she yet possessed the energy to collect the knowledge and to\nundergo the experience which alone could enable her to do what she had\ndetermined she would do in the end. In secret she devoured the reports\nof medical commissions, the pamphlets of sanitary authorities, the\nhistories of hospitals and homes. She spent the intervals of the London\nseason in ragged schools and workhouses. When she went abroad with her\nfamily, she used her spare time so well that there was hardly a great\nhospital in Europe with which she was not acquainted; hardly a great\ncity whose slums she had not passed through. She managed to spend some\ndays in a convent school in Rome, and some weeks as a 'Soeur de Charite'\nin Paris. Then, while her mother and sister were taking the waters at\nCarlsbad, she succeeded in slipping off to a nursing institution at\nKaiserswerth, where she remained for more than three months. This was\nthe critical event of her life. The experience which she gained as a\nnurse at Kaiserswerth formed the foundation of all her future action and\nfinally fixed her in her career.\n\nBut one other trial awaited her. The allurements of the world she had\nbrushed aside with disdain and loathing; she had resisted the subtler\ntemptation which, in her weariness, had sometimes come upon her, of\ndevoting her baffled energies to art or literature; the last ordeal\nappeared in the shape of a desirable young man. Hitherto, her lovers had\nbeen nothing to her but an added burden and a mockery; but now--for a\nmoment--she wavered. A new feeling swept over her--a feeling which she\nhad never known before--which she was never to know again. The most\npowerful and the profoundest of all the instincts of humanity laid claim\nupon her. But it rose before her, that instinct, arrayed--how could it\nbe otherwise?--in the inevitable habiliments of a Victorian marriage;\nand she had the strength to stamp it underfoot.\n\n'I have an intellectual nature which requires satisfaction,' she noted,\n'and that would find it in him. I have a passionate nature which\nrequires satisfaction, and that would find it in him. I have a moral, an\nactive nature which requires satisfaction, and that would not find it in\nhis life. Sometimes I think that I will satisfy my passionate nature at\nall events....'\n\nBut no, she knew in her heart that it could not be. 'To be nailed to a\ncontinuation and exaggeration of my present life ... to put it out of my\npower ever to be able to seize the chance of forming for myself a true\nand rich life'--that would be a suicide. She made her choice, and\nrefused what was at least a certain happiness for a visionary good which\nmight never come to her at all. And so she returned to her old life of\nwaiting and bitterness.\n\n'The thoughts and feelings that I have now,' she wrote, 'I can remember\nsince I was six years old. A profession, a trade, a necessary\noccupation, something to fill and employ all my faculties, I have always\nfelt essential to me, I have always longed for. The first thought I can\nremember, and the last, was nursing work; and in the absence of this,\neducation work, but more the education of the bad than of the young ...\nEverything has been tried--foreign travel, kind friends, everything. My\nGod! What is to become of me?'\n\nA desirable young man? Dust and ashes! What was there desirable in such\na thing as that? 'In my thirty-first year,' she noted in her diary, 'I\nsee nothing desirable but death.'\n\nThree more years passed, and then at last the pressure of time told; her\nfamily seemed to realise that she was old enough and strong enough to\nhave her way; and she became the superintendent of a charitable nursing\nhome in Harley Street. She had gained her independence, though it was in\na meagre sphere enough; and her mother was still not quite resigned:\nsurely Florence might at least spend the summer in the country. At\ntimes, indeed, among her intimates, Mrs. Nightingale almost wept. 'We\nare ducks,' she said with tears in her eyes, 'who have hatched a wild\nswan.' But the poor lady was wrong; it was not a swan that they had\nhatched, it was an eagle.\n\n\nII\n\nMiss NIGHTINGALE had been a year in her nursing-home in Harley Street,\nwhen Fate knocked at the door. The Crimean War broke out; the battle of\nthe Alma was fought; and the terrible condition of our military\nhospitals at Scutari began to be known in England. It sometimes happens\nthat the plans of Providence are a little difficult to follow, but on\nthis occasion all was plain; there was a perfect coordination of events.\nFor years Miss Nightingale had been getting ready; at last she was\nprepared--experienced, free, mature, yet still young (she was\nthirty-four)--desirous to serve, accustomed to command: at that precise\nmoment the desperate need of a great nation came, and she was there to\nsatisfy it. If the war had fallen a few years earlier, she would have\nlacked the knowledge, perhaps even the power, for such a work; a few\nyears later and she would, no doubt, have been fixed in the routine of\nsome absorbing task, and moreover, she would have been growing old.\n\nNor was it only the coincidence of time that was remarkable. It so fell\nout that Sidney Herbert was at the War Office and in the Cabinet; and\nSidney Herbert was an intimate friend of Miss Nightingale's, convinced,\nfrom personal experience in charitable work, of her supreme capacity.\nAfter such premises, it seems hardly more than a matter of course that\nher letter, in which she offered her services for the East, and Sidney\nHerbert's letter, in which he asked for them, should actually have\ncrossed in the post. Thus it all happened, without a hitch. The\nappointment was made and even Mrs. Nightingale, overawed by the\nmagnitude of the venture, could only approve. A pair of faithful friends\noffered themselves as personal attendants; thirty-eight nurses were\ncollected; and within a week of the crossing of the letters Miss\nNightingale, amid a great burst of popular enthusiasm, left for\nConstantinople.\n\nAmong the numerous letters which she received on her departure was one\nfrom Dr. Manning, who at that time was working in comparative obscurity\nas a Catholic priest in Bayswater. 'God will keep you,' he wrote, 'and\nmy prayer for you will be that your one object of worship, Pattern of\nImitation, and source of consolation and strength, may be the Sacred\nHeart of our Divine Lord.'\n\nTo what extent Dr. Manning's prayer was answered must remain a matter of\ndoubt; but this much is certain: that if ever a prayer was needed, it\nwas needed then for Florence Nightingale. For dark as had been the\npicture of the state of affairs at Scutari, revealed to the English\npublic in the dispatches of \"The Times Correspondent\", and in a\nmultitude of private letters, yet the reality turned out to be darker\nstill. What had occurred was, in brief, the complete breakdown of our\nmedical arrangements at the seat of war. The origins of this awful\nfailure were complex and manifold; they stretched back through long\nyears of peace and carelessness in England; they could be traced through\nendless ramifications of administrative incapacity--from the inherent\nfaults of confused systems, to the petty bunglings of minor officials,\nfrom the inevitable ignorance of Cabinet Ministers, to the fatal\nexactitudes of narrow routine.\n\nIn the inquiries which followed, it was clearly shown that the evil was\nin reality that worst of all evils--one which has been caused by nothing\nin particular and for which no one in particular is to blame. The whole\norganisation of the war machine was incompetent and out of date. The old\nDuke had sat for a generation at the Horse Guards repressing innovations\nwith an iron hand. There was an extraordinary overlapping of authorities\nand an almost incredible shifting of responsibilities to and fro. As for\nsuch a notion as the creation and the maintenance of a really adequate\nmedical service for the army--in that atmosphere of aged chaos, how\ncould it have entered anybody's head? Before the war, the easygoing\nofficials at Westminster were naturally persuaded that all was well--or\nat least as well as could be expected; when someone, for instance,\nactually had the temerity to suggest the formation of a corps of Army\nnurses, he was at once laughed out of court. When the war had begun, the\ngallant British officers in control of affairs had other things to think\nabout than the petty details of medical organisation. Who had bothered\nwith such trifles in the Peninsula? And surely, on that occasion, we had\ndone pretty well. Thus, the most obvious precautions were neglected, and\nthe most necessary preparations were put off from day to day. The\nprincipal medical officer of the Army, Dr. Hall, was summoned from India\nat a moment's notice, and was unable to visit England before taking up\nhis duties at the front. And it was not until after the battle of the\nAlma, when we had been at war for many months, that we acquired hospital\naccommodations at Scutari for more than a thousand men. Errors, follies,\nand vices on the part of individuals there doubtless were; but, in the\ngeneral reckoning, they were of small account--insignificant symptoms of\nthe deep disease of the body politic--to the enormous calamity of\nadministrative collapse.\n\nMiss Nightingale arrived at Scutari--a suburb of Constantinople, on the\nAsiatic side of the Bosphorus--on November 4th, 1854; it was ten days\nafter the battle of Balaclava, and the day before the battle of\nInkerman. The organisation of the hospitals, which had already given way\nunder the stress of the battle of the Alma, was now to be subjected to\nthe further pressure which these two desperate and bloody engagements\nimplied. Great detachments of wounded were already beginning to pour in.\nThe men, after receiving such summary treatment as could be given them\nat the smaller hospitals in the Crimea itself, were forthwith shipped in\nbatches of 200 across the Black Sea to Scutari. This voyage was in\nnormal times one of four days and a half; but the times were no longer\nnormal, and now the transit often lasted for a fortnight or three weeks.\nIt received, not without reason, the name of the 'middle passage'.\nBetween, and sometimes on the decks, the wounded, the sick, and the\ndying were crowded--men who had just undergone the amputation of limbs,\nmen in the clutches of fever or of frostbite, men in the last stages of\ndysentry and cholera--without beds, sometimes without blankets, often\nhardly clothed. The one or two surgeons on board did what they could;\nbut medical stores were lacking, and the only form of nursing available\nwas that provided by a handful of invalid soldiers who were usually\nthemselves prostrate by the end of the voyage. There was no other food\nbeside the ordinary salt rations of ship diet; and even the water was\nsometimes so stored that it was out of reach of the weak. For many\nmonths, the average of deaths during these voyages was seventy-four in\n1,000; the corpses were shot out into the waters; and who shall say that\nthey were the most unfortunate? At Scutari, the landing-stage,\nconstructed with all the perverseness of Oriental ingenuity, could only\nbe approached with great difficulty, and, in rough weather, not at all.\nWhen it was reached, what remained of the men in the ships had first to\nbe disembarked, and then conveyed up a steep slope of a quarter of a\nmile to the nearest of the hospitals. The most serious cases might be\nput upon stretchers--for there were far too few for all; the rest were\ncarried or dragged up the hill by such convalescent soldiers as could be\ngot together, who were not too obviously infirm for the work. At last\nthe journey was accomplished; slowly, one by one, living or dying, the\nwounded were carried up into the hospital. And in the hospital what did\nthey find?\n\nLasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate: the delusive doors bore no such\ninscription; and yet behind them Hell yawned. Want, neglect, confusion,\nmisery--in every shape and in every degree of intensity--filled the\nendless corridors and the vast apartments of the gigantic barrack-house,\nwhich, without forethought or preparation, had been hurriedly set aside\nas the chief shelter for the victims of the war. The very building\nitself was radically defective. Huge sewers underlay it, and cesspools\nloaded with filth wafted their poison into the upper rooms. The floors\nwere in so rotten a condition that many of them could not be scrubbed;\nthe walls were thick with dirt; incredible multitudes of vermin swarmed\neverywhere. And, enormous as the building was, it was yet too small. It\ncontained four miles of beds, crushed together so close that there was\nbut just room to pass between them. Under such conditions, the most\nelaborate system of ventilation might well have been at fault; but here\nthere was no ventilation. The stench was indescribable. 'I have been\nwell acquainted,' said Miss Nightingale, 'with the dwellings of the\nworst parts of most of the great cities in Europe, but have never been\nin any atmosphere which I could compare with that of the Barrack\nHospital at night.' The structural defects were equalled by the\ndeficiencies in the commonest objects of hospital use. There were not\nenough bedsteads; the sheets were of canvas, and so coarse that the\nwounded men recoiled from them, begging to be left in their blankets;\nthere was no bedroom furniture of any kind, and empty beer bottles were\nused for candlesticks. There were no basins, no towels, no soap, no\nbrooms, no mops, no trays, no plates; there were neither slippers nor\nscissors, neither shoe-brushes nor blacking; there were no knives or\nforks or spoons. The supply of fuel was constantly deficient. The\ncooking arrangements were preposterously inadequate, and the laundry was\na farce. As for purely medical materials, the tale was no better.\nStretchers, splints, bandages--all were lacking; and so were the most\nordinary drugs.\n\nTo replace such wants, to struggle against such difficulties, there was\na handful of men overburdened by the strain of ceaseless work, bound\ndown by the traditions of official routine, and enfeebled either by old\nage or inexperience or sheer incompetence. They had proved utterly\nunequal to their task. The principal doctor was lost in the imbecilities\nof a senile optimism. The wretched official whose business it was to\nprovide for the wants of the hospital was tied fast hand and foot by red\ntape. A few of the younger doctors struggled valiantly, but what could\nthey do? Unprepared, disorganised, with such help only as they could\nfind among the miserable band of convalescent soldiers drafted off to\ntend their sick comrades, they were faced with disease, mutilation, and\ndeath in all their most appalling forms, crowded multitudinously about\nthem in an ever-increasing mass. They were like men in a shipwreck,\nfighting, not for safety, but for the next moment's bare existence--to\ngain, by yet another frenzied effort, some brief respite from the waters\nof destruction.\n\nIn these surroundings, those who had been long inured to scenes of human\nsuffering--surgeons with a world-wide knowledge of agonies, soldiers\nfamiliar with fields of carnage, missionaries with remembrances of\nfamine and of plague--yet found a depth of horror which they had never\nknown before. There were moments, there were places, in the Barrack\nHospital at Scutari, where the strongest hand was struck with trembling,\nand the boldest eye would turn away its gaze.\n\nMiss Nightingale came, and she, at any rate, in that inferno, did not\nabandon hope. For one thing, she brought material succour. Before she\nleft London she had consulted Dr. Andrew Smith, the head of the Army\nMedical Board, as to whether it would be useful to take out stores of\nany kind to Scutari; and Dr. Andrew Smith had told her that 'nothing was\nneeded'. Even Sidney Herbert had given her similar assurances; possibly,\nowing to an oversight, there might have been some delay in the delivery\nof the medical stores, which, he said, had been sent out from England\n'in profusion', but 'four days would have remedied this'. She preferred\nto trust her own instincts, and at Marseilles purchased a large quantity\nof miscellaneous provisions, which were of the utmost use at Scutari.\nShe came, too, amply provided with money--in all, during her stay in the\nEast, about L7,000 reached her from private sources; and, in addition,\nshe was able to avail herself of another valuable means of help. At the\nsame time as herself, Mr. Macdonald, of The Times, had arrived at\nScutari, charged with the duty of administering the large sums of money\ncollected through the agency of that newspaper in aid of the sick and\nwounded; and Mr. Macdonald had the sense to see that the best use he\ncould make of The Times Fund was to put it at the disposal of Miss\nNightingale.\n\n'I cannot conceive,' wrote an eye-witness, 'as I now calmly look back on\nthe first three weeks after the arrival of the wounded from Inkerman,\nhow it could have been possible to have avoided a state of things too\ndisastrous to contemplate, had not Miss Nightingale been there, with the\nmeans placed at her disposal by Mr. Macdonald.'\n\nBut the official view was different. What! Was the public service to\nadmit, by accepting outside charity, that it was unable to discharge its\nown duties without the assistance of private and irregular benevolence?\nNever! And accordingly when Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, our ambassador\nat Constantinople, was asked by Mr. Macdonald to indicate how The Times\nFund could best be employed, he answered that there was indeed one\nobject to which it might very well be devoted--the building of an\nEnglish Protestant Church at Pera.\n\nMr. Macdonald did not waste further time with Lord Stratford, and\nimmediately joined forces with Miss Nightingale. But, with such a frame\nof mind in the highest quarters, it is easy to imagine the kind of\ndisgust and alarm with which the sudden intrusion of a band of amateurs\nand females must have filled the minds of the ordinary officer and the\nordinary military surgeon. They could not understand it--what had women\nto do with war? Honest Colonels relieved their spleen by the cracking of\nheavy jokes about 'the Bird'; while poor Dr. Hall, a rough terrier of a\nman, who had worried his way to the top of his profession, was struck\nspeechless with astonishment, and at last observed that Miss\nNightingale's appointment was extremely droll.\n\nHer position was, indeed, an official one, but it was hardly the easier\nfor that. In the hospitals it was her duty to provide the services of\nherself and her nurses when they were asked for by the doctors, and not\nuntil then. At first some of the surgeons would have nothing to say to\nher, and, though she was welcomed by others, the majority were hostile\nand suspicious. But gradually she gained ground. Her good will could not\nbe denied, and her capacity could not be disregarded. With consummate\ntact, with all the gentleness of supreme strength, she managed at last\nto impose her personality upon the susceptible, overwrought,\ndiscouraged, and helpless group of men in authority who surrounded her.\nShe stood firm; she was a rock in the angry ocean; with her alone was\nsafety, comfort, life. And so it was that hope dawned at Scutari. The\nreign of chaos and old night began to dwindle; order came upon the\nscene, and common sense, and forethought, and decision, radiating out\nfrom the little room off the great gallery in the Barrack Hospital\nwhere, day and night, the Lady Superintendent was at her task. Progress\nmight be slow, but it was sure.\n\nThe first sign of a great change came with the appearance of some of\nthose necessary objects with which the hospitals had been unprovided for\nmonths. The sick men began to enjoy the use of towels and soap, knives\nand forks, combs and tooth-brushes. Dr. Hall might snort when he heard\nof it, asking, with a growl, what a soldier wanted with a tooth-brush;\nbut the good work went on. Eventually the whole business of purveying to\nthe hospitals was, in effect, carried out by Miss Nightingale. She\nalone, it seemed, whatever the contingency, knew where to lay her hands\non what was wanted; she alone could dispense her stores with readiness;\nabove all, she alone possessed the art of circumventing the pernicious\ninfluences of official etiquette. This was her greatest enemy, and\nsometimes even she was baffled by it. On one occasion 27,000 shirts,\nsent out at her instance by the Home Government, arrived, were landed,\nand were only waiting to be unpacked. But the official 'Purveyor'\nintervened; 'he could not unpack them,' he said, 'with out a Board.'\nMiss Nightingale pleaded in vain; the sick and wounded lay half-naked\nshivering for want of clothing; and three weeks elapsed before the Board\nreleased the shirts. A little later, however, on a similar occasion,\nMiss Nightingale felt that she could assert her own authority. She\nordered a Government consignment to be forcibly opened while the\nmiserable 'Purveyor' stood by, wringing his hands in departmental agony.\n\nVast quantities of valuable stores sent from England lay, she found,\nengulfed in the bottomless abyss of the Turkish Customs House. Other\nship-loads, buried beneath munitions of war destined for Balaclava,\npassed Scutari without a sign, and thus hospital materials were\nsometimes carried to and fro three times over the Black Sea, before they\nreached their destination. The whole system was clearly at fault, and\nMiss Nightingale suggested to the home authorities that a Government\nStore House should be instituted at Scutari for the reception and\ndistribution of the consignments. Six months after her arrival this was\ndone.\n\nIn the meantime, she had reorganised the kitchens and the laundries in\nthe hospitals. The ill-cooked hunks of meat, vilely served at irregular\nintervals, which had hitherto been the only diet for the sick men, were\nreplaced by punctual meals, well-prepared and appetising, while\nstrengthening extra foods--soups and wines and jellies ('preposterous\nluxuries', snarled Dr. Hall)--were distributed to those who needed them.\nOne thing, however, she could not effect. The separation of the bones\nfrom the meat was no part of official cookery: the rule was that the\nfood must be divided into equal portions, and if some of the portions\nwere all bone--well, every man must take his chance. The rule, perhaps,\nwas not a very good one; but there it was. 'It would require a new\nRegulation of the Service,' she was told, 'to bone the meat.' As for the\nwashing arrangements, they were revolutionised. Up to the time of Miss\nNightingale's arrival, the number of shirts the authorities had\nsucceeded in washing was seven. The hospital bedding, she found, was\n'washed' in cold water. She took a Turkish house, had boilers installed,\nand employed soldiers' wives to do the laundry work. The expenses were\ndefrayed from her own funds and that of The Times; and henceforward, the\nsick and wounded had the comfort of clean linen.\n\nThen she turned her attention to their clothing. Owing to military\nexigencies, the greater number of the men had abandoned their kit; their\nknapsacks were lost forever; they possessed nothing but what was on\ntheir persons, and that was usually only fit for speedy destruction. The\n'Purveyor', of course, pointed out that, according to the regulations,\nall soldiers should bring with them into hospital an adequate supply of\nclothing, and he declared that it was no business of his to make good\ntheir deficiencies. Apparently, it was the business of Miss Nightingale.\nShe procured socks, boots, and shirts in enormous quantities; she had\ntrousers made, she rigged up dressing-gowns. 'The fact is,' she told\nSidney Herbert, I am now clothing the British Army.'\n\nAll at once, word came from the Crimea that a great new contingent of\nsick and wounded might shortly be expected. Where were they to go? Every\navailable inch in the wards was occupied; the affair was serious and\npressing, and the authorities stood aghast. There were some dilapidated\nrooms in the Barrack Hospital, unfit for human habitation, but Miss\nNightingale believed that if measures were promptly taken they might be\nmade capable of accommodating several hundred beds. One of the doctors\nagreed with her; the rest of the officials were irresolute--it would be\na very expensive job, they said; it would involve building; and who\ncould take the responsibility? The proper course was that a\nrepresentation should be made to the Director-General of the Army\nMedical Department in London; then the Director-General would apply to\nthe Horse Guards, the Horse Guards would move the Ordnance, the Ordnance\nwould lay the matter before the Treasury, and, if the Treasury gave its\nconsent, the work might be correctly carried through, several months\nafter the necessity for it had disappeared. Miss Nightingale, however,\nhad made up her mind, and she persuaded Lord Stratford--or thought she\nhad persuaded him--to give his sanction to the required expenditure. One\nhundred and twenty-five workmen were immediately engaged, and the work\nwas begun. The workmen struck; whereupon Lord Stratford washed his hands\nof the whole business. Miss Nightingale engaged 200 other workmen on her\nown authority, and paid the bill out of her own resources. The wards\nwere ready by the required date; 500 sick men were received in them; and\nall the utensils, including knives, forks, spoons, cans and towels, were\nsupplied by Miss Nightingale.\n\nThis remarkable woman was in truth performing the function of an\nadministrative chief. How had this come about? Was she not in reality\nmerely a nurse? Was it not her duty simply to tend the sick? And indeed,\nwas it not as a ministering angel, a gentle 'lady with a lamp', that she\nactually impressed the minds of her contemporaries? No doubt that was\nso; and yet it is no less certain that, as she herself said, the\nspecific business of nursing was 'the least important of the functions\ninto which she had been forced'. It was clear that in the state of\ndisorganisation into which the hospitals at Scutari had fallen, the most\npressing, the really vital, need was for something more than nursing; it\nwas for the necessary elements of civilised life--the commonest material\nobjects, the most ordinary cleanliness, the rudimentary habits of order\nand authority. 'Oh, dear Miss Nightingale,' said one of her party as\nthey were approaching Constantinople, 'when we land, let there be no\ndelays, let us get straight to nursing the poor fellows!' 'The strongest\nwill be wanted at the wash-tub,' was Miss Nightingale's answer. And it\nwas upon the wash-tub, and all that the wash-tub stood for, that she\nexpended her greatest energies. Yet to say that, is perhaps to say too\nmuch. For to those who watched her at work among the sick, moving day\nand night from bed to bed, with that unflinching courage, with that\nindefatigable vigilance, it seemed as if the concentrated force of an\nundivided and unparalleled devotion could hardly suffice for that\nportion of her task alone.\n\nWherever, in those vast wards, suffering was at its worst and the need\nfor help was greatest, there, as if by magic, was Miss Nightingale. Her\nsuperhuman equanimity would, at the moment of some ghastly operation,\nnerve the victim to endure, and almost to hope. Her sympathy would\nassuage the pangs of dying and bring back to those still living\nsomething of the forgotten charm of life. Over and over again her\nuntiring efforts rescued those whom the surgeons had abandoned as beyond\nthe possibility of cure. Her mere presence brought with it a strange\ninfluence. A passionate idolatry spread among the men--they kissed her\nshadow as it passed. They did more. 'Before she came,' said a soldier,\n'there was cussin' and swearin' but after that it was as 'oly as a\nchurch.' The most cherished privilege of the fighting man was abandoned\nfor the sake of Miss Nightingale. In those 'lowest sinks of human\nmisery', as she herself put it, she never heard the use of one\nexpression 'which could distress a gentlewoman'.\n\nShe was heroic; and these were the humble tributes paid by those of\ngrosser mould to that high quality. Certainly, she was heroic. Yet her\nheroism was not of that simple sort so dear to the readers of novels and\nthe compilers of hagiologies--the romantic sentimental heroism with\nwhich mankind loves to invest its chosen darlings: it was made of\nsterner stuff. To the wounded soldier on his couch of agony, she might\nwell appear in the guise of a gracious angel of mercy; but the military\nsurgeons, and the orderlies, and her own nurses, and the 'Purveyor', and\nDr. Hall, and, even Lord Stratford himself, could tell a different\nstory. It was not by gentle sweetness and womanly self-abnegation that\nshe had brought order out of chaos in the Scutari hospitals, that, from\nher own resources, she had clothed the British Army, that she had spread\nher dominion over the serried and reluctant powers of the official\nworld; it was by strict method, by stern discipline, by rigid attention\nto detail, by ceaseless labour, and by the fixed determination of an\nindomitable will.\n\nBeneath her cool and calm demeanour lurked fierce and passionate fires.\nAs she passed through the wards in her plain dress, so quiet, so\nunassuming, she struck the casual observer simply as the pattern of a\nperfect lady; but the keener eye perceived something more than that--the\nserenity of high deliberation in the scope of the capacious brow, the\nsign of power in the dominating curve of the thin nose, and the traces\nof a harsh and dangerous temper--something peevish, something mocking,\nand yet something precise--in the small and delicate mouth. There was\nhumour in the face; but the curious watcher might wonder whether it was\nhumour of a very pleasant kind; might ask himself, even as he heard the\nlaughter and marked the jokes with which she cheered the spirits of her\npatients, what sort of sardonic merriment this same lady might not give\nvent to, in the privacy of her chamber. As for her voice, it was true of\nit, even more than of her countenance, that it 'had that in it one must\nfain call master'. Those clear tones were in no need of emphasis: 'I\nnever heard her raise her voice', said one of her companions. 'Only when\nshe had spoken, it seemed as if nothing could follow but obedience.'\nOnce, when she had given some direction, a doctor ventured to remark\nthat the thing could not be done. 'But it must be done,' said Miss\nNightingale. A chance bystander, who heard the words, never forgot\nthrough all his life the irresistible authority of them. And they were\nspoken quietly--very quietly indeed.\n\nLate at night, when the long miles of beds lay wrapped in darkness, Miss\nNightingale would sit at work in her little room, over her\ncorrespondence. It was one of the most formidable of all her duties.\nThere were hundreds of letters to be written to the friends and\nrelations of soldiers; there was the enormous mass of official documents\nto be dealt with; there were her own private letters to be answered;\nand, most important of all, there was the composition of her long and\nconfidential reports to Sidney Herbert. These were by no means official\ncommunications. Her soul, pent up all day in the restraint and reserve\nof a vast responsibility, now at last poured itself out in these letters\nwith all its natural vehemence, like a swollen torrent through an open\nsluice. Here, at least, she did not mince matters. Here she painted in\nher darkest colours the hideous scenes which surrounded her; here she\ntore away remorselessly the last veils still shrouding the abominable\ntruth. Then she would fill pages with recommendations and suggestions,\nwith criticisms of the minutest details of organisation, with elaborate\ncalculations of contingencies, with exhaustive analyses and statistical\nstatements piled up in breathless eagerness one on the top of the other.\nAnd then her pen, in the virulence of its volubility, would rush on to\nthe discussion of individuals, to the denunciation of an incompetent\nsurgeon or the ridicule of a self-sufficient nurse. Her sarcasm searched\nthe ranks of the officials with the deadly and unsparing precision of a\nmachine-gun. Her nicknames were terrible. She respected no one: Lord\nStratford, Lord Raglan, Lady Stratford, Dr. Andrew Smith, Dr. Hall, the\nCommissary-General, the Purveyor--she fulminated against them all. The\nintolerable futility of mankind obsessed her like a nightmare, and she\ngnashed her teeth against it. 'I do well to be angry,' was the burden of\nher cry. 'How many just men were there at Scutari? How many who cared at\nall for the sick, or had done anything for their relief? Were there ten?\nWere there five? Was there even one?' She could not be sure.\n\nAt one time, during several weeks, her vituperations descended upon the\nhead of Sidney Herbert himself. He had misinterpreted her wishes, he had\ntraversed her positive instructions, and it was not until he had\nadmitted his error and apologised in abject terms that he was allowed\nagain into favour. While this misunderstanding was at its height, an\naristocratic young gentleman arrived at Scutari with a recommendation\nfrom the Minister. He had come out from England filled with a romantic\ndesire to render homage to the angelic heroine of his dreams. He had, he\nsaid, cast aside his life of ease and luxury; he would devote his days\nand nights to the service of that gentle lady; he would perform the most\nmenial offices, he would 'fag' for her, he would be her footman--and\nfeel requited by a single smile. A single smile, indeed, he had, but it\nwas of an unexpected kind. Miss Nightingale at first refused to see him,\nand then, when she consented, believing that he was an emissary sent by\nSidney Herbert to put her in the wrong over their dispute, she took\nnotes of her conversation with him, and insisted on his signing them at\nthe end of it. The young gentleman returned to England by the next ship.\n\nThis quarrel with Sidney Herbert was, however, an exceptional incident.\nAlike by him, and by Lord Panmure, his successor at the War Office, she\nwas firmly supported; and the fact that during the whole of her stay at\nScutari she had the Home Government at her back, was her trump card in\nher dealings with the hospital authorities. Nor was it only the\nGovernment that was behind her: public opinion in England early\nrecognised the high importance of her mission, and its enthusiastic\nappreciation of her work soon reached an extraordinary height. The Queen\nherself was deeply moved. She made repeated inquiries as to the welfare\nof Miss Nightingale; she asked to see her accounts of the wounded, and\nmade her the intermediary between the throne and the troops.\n\n'Let Mrs. Herbert know,' she wrote to the War Minister, 'that I wish\nMiss Nightingale and the ladies would tell these poor noble, wounded,\nand sick men that NO ONE takes a warmer interest or feels MORE for their\nsufferings or admires their courage and heroism MORE than their Queen.\nDay and night she thinks of her beloved troops. So does the Prince. Beg\nMrs. Herbert to communicate these my words to those ladies, as I know\nthat our sympathy is much valued by these noble fellows.'\n\nThe letter was read aloud in the wards by the Chaplain. 'It is a very\nfeeling letter,' said the men.\n\nAnd so the months passed, and that fell winter which had begun with\nInkerman and had dragged itself out through the long agony of the\ninvestment of Sebastopol, at last was over. In May, 1855, after six\nmonths of labour, Miss Nightingale could look with something like\nsatisfaction at the condition of the Scutari hospitals. Had they done\nnothing more than survive the terrible strain which had been put upon\nthem, it would have been a matter for congratulation; but they had done\nmuch more than that--they had marvellously improved. The confusion and\nthe pressure in the wards had come to an end; order reigned in them, and\ncleanliness; the supplies were bountiful and prompt; important sanitary\nworks had been carried out. One simple comparison of figures was enough\nto reveal the extraordinary change: the rate of mortality among the\ncases treated had fallen from forty-two percent to twenty-two per 1,000.\nBut still, the indefatigable lady was not satisfied. The main problem\nhad been solved--the physical needs of the men had been provided for;\ntheir mental and spiritual needs remained. She set up and furnished\nreading-rooms and recreation rooms. She started classes and lectures.\nOfficers were amazed to see her treating their men as if they were human\nbeings, and assured her that she would only end by 'spoiling the\nbrutes'. But that was not Miss Nightingale's opinion, and she was\njustified. The private soldier began to drink less and even--though that\nseemed impossible--to save his pay. Miss Nightingale became a banker for\nthe Army, receiving and sending home large sums of money every month. At\nlast, reluctantly, the Government followed suit, and established\nmachinery of its own for the remission of money. Lord Panmure, however,\nremained sceptical; 'it will do no good,' he pronounced; 'the British\nsoldier is not a remitting animal.' But, in fact during the next six\nmonths L71,000 was sent home.\n\nAmid all these activities, Miss Nightingale took up the further task of\ninspecting the hospitals in the Crimea itself. The labour was extreme,\nand the conditions of life were almost intolerable. She spent whole days\nin the saddle, or was driven over those bleak and rocky heights in a\nbaggage cart. Sometimes she stood for hours in the heavily failing snow,\nand would only reach her hut at dead of night after walking for miles\nthrough perilous ravines. Her powers of resistance seemed incredible,\nbut at last they were exhausted. She was attacked by fever, and for a\nmoment came very near to death. Yet she worked on; if she could not\nmove, she could at least write, and write she did until her mind had\nleft her; and after it had left her, in what seemed the delirious trance\nof death itself, she still wrote. When, after many weeks, she was strong\nenough to travel, she was implored to return to England, but she utterly\nrefused. She would not go back, she said, before the last of the\nsoldiers had left Scutari.\n\nThis happy moment had almost arrived, when suddenly the smouldering\nhostilities of the medical authorities burst out into a flame. Dr.\nHall's labours had been rewarded by a K.C.B--letters which, as Miss\nNightingale told Sidney Herbert, she could only suppose to mean 'Knight\nof the Crimean Burial-Grounds'--and the honour had turned his head. He\nwas Sir John, and he would be thwarted no longer. Disputes had lately\narisen between Miss Nightingale and some of the nurses in the Crimean\nhospitals. The situation had been embittered by rumours of religious\ndissensions, while the Crimean nurses were Roman Catholics, many of\nthose at Scutari were suspected of a regrettable propensity towards the\ntenets of Dr. Pusey. Miss Nightingale was by no means disturbed by these\nsectarian differences, but any suggestion that her supreme authority\nover all the nurses with the Army was, no doubt, enough to rouse her to\nfury; and it appeared that Mrs. Bridgeman, the Reverend Mother in the\nCrimea, had ventured to call that authority in question. Sir John Hall\nthought that his opportunity had come, and strongly supported Mrs.\nBridgeman--or, as Miss Nightingale preferred to call her, the 'Reverend\nBrickbat'.\n\nThere was a violent struggle; Miss Nightingale's rage was terrible. Dr.\nHall, she declared, was doing his best to 'root her out of the Crimea'.\nShe would bear it no longer; the War Office was playing her false; there\nwas only one thing to be done--Sidney Herbert must move for the\nproduction of papers in the House of Commons, so that the public might\nbe able to judge between her and her enemies. Sidney Herbert, with great\ndifficulty, calmed her down. Orders were immediately dispatched putting\nher supremacy beyond doubt, and the Reverend Brickbat withdrew from the\nscene. Sir John, however, was more tenacious. A few weeks later, Miss\nNightingale and her nurses visited the Crimea for the last time, and the\nbrilliant idea occurred to him that he could crush her by a very simple\nexpedient--he would starve her into submission; and he actually ordered\nthat no rations of any kind should be supplied to her. He had already\ntried this plan with great effect upon an unfortunate medical man whose\npresence in the Crimea he had considered an intrusion; but he was now to\nlearn that such tricks were thrown away upon Miss Nightingale. With\nextraordinary foresight, she had brought with her a great supply of\nfood; she succeeded in obtaining more at her own expense and by her own\nexertions; and thus for ten days, in that inhospitable country, she was\nable to feed herself and twenty-four nurses. Eventually, the military\nauthorities intervened in her favour, and Sir John had to confess that\nhe was beaten.\n\nIt was not until July, 1856--four months after the Declaration of\nPeace--that Miss Nightingale left Scutari for England. Her reputation\nwas now enormous, and the enthusiasm of the public was unbounded. The\nroyal approbation was expressed by the gift of a brooch, accompanied by\na private letter.\n\n'You are, I know, well aware,' wrote Her Majesty, 'of the high sense I\nentertain of the Christian devotion which you have displayed during this\ngreat and bloody war, and I need hardly repeat to you how warm my\nadmiration is for your services, which are fully equal to those of my\ndear and brave soldiers, whose sufferings you have had the privilege of\nalleviating in so merciful a manner. I am, however, anxious of marking\nmy feelings in a manner which I trust will be agreeable to you, and\ntherefore, send you with this letter a brooch, the form and emblems of\nwhich commemorate your great and blessed work, and which I hope you will\nwear as a mark of the high approbation of your Sovereign!\n\n'It will be a very great satisfaction to me,' Her Majesty added, 'to\nmake the acquaintance of one who has set so bright an example to our\nsex.'\n\nThe brooch, which was designed by the Prince Consort, bore a St.\nGeorge's cross in red enamel, and the Royal cipher surmounted by\ndiamonds. The whole was encircled by the inscription 'Blessed are the\nMerciful'.\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE name of Florence Nightingale lives in the memory of the world by\nvirtue of the lurid and heroic adventure of the Crimea. Had she died--as\nshe nearly did--upon her return to England, her reputation would hardly\nhave been different; her legend would have come down to us almost as we\nknow it today--that gentle vision of female virtue which first took\nshape before the adoring eyes of the sick soldiers at Scutari. Yet, as a\nmatter of fact, she lived for more than half a century after the Crimean\nWar; and during the greater part of that long period, all the energy and\nall the devotion of her extraordinary nature were working at their\nhighest pitch. What she accomplished in those years of unknown labour\ncould, indeed, hardly have been more glorious than her Crimean triumphs,\nbut it was certainly more important. The true history was far stranger\neven than the myth. In Miss Nightingale's own eyes the adventure of the\nCrimea was a mere incident--scarcely more than a useful stepping-stone\nin her career. It was the fulcrum with which she hoped to move the\nworld; but it was only the fulcrum. For more than a generation she was\nto sit in secret, working her lever: and her real \"life\" began at the\nvery moment when, in the popular imagination, it had ended.\n\nShe arrived in England in a shattered state of health. The hardships and\nthe ceaseless effort of the last two years had undermined her nervous\nsystem; her heart was pronounced to be affected; she suffered constantly\nfrom fainting-fits and terrible attacks of utter physical prostration.\nThe doctors declared that one thing alone would save her--a complete and\nprolonged rest. But that was also the one thing with which she would\nhave nothing to do. She had never been in the habit of resting; why\nshould she begin now? Now, when her opportunity had come at last; now,\nwhen the iron was hot, and it was time to strike? No; she had work to\ndo; and, come what might, she would do it. The doctors protested in\nvain; in vain her family lamented and entreated; in vain her friends\npointed out to her the madness of such a course. Madness?\nMad--possessed--perhaps she was. A demoniac frenzy had seized upon her.\nAs she lay upon her sofa, gasping, she devoured blue-books, dictated\nletters, and, in the intervals of her palpitations, cracked her febrile\njokes. For months at a stretch she never left her bed. For years she was\nin daily expectation of death. But she would not rest. At this rate, the\ndoctors assured her, even if she did not die, she would, become an\ninvalid for life. She could not help that; there was the work to be\ndone; and, as for rest, very likely she might rest ... when she had done\nit.\n\nWherever she went, in London or in the country, in the hills of\nDerbyshire, or among the rhododendrons at Embley, she was haunted by a\nghost. It was the spectre of Scutari--the hideous vision of the\norganisation of a military hospital. She would lay that phantom, or she\nwould perish. The whole system of the Army Medical Department, the\neducation of the Medical Officer, the regulations of hospital procedure\n... REST? How could she rest while these things were as they were,\nwhile, if the like necessity were to arise again, the like results would\nfollow? And, even in peace and at home, what was the sanitary condition\nof the Army? The mortality in the barracks was, she found, nearly double\nthe mortality in civil life. 'You might as well take 1,100 men every\nyear out upon Salisbury Plain and shoot them,' she said. After\ninspecting the hospitals at Chatham, she smiled grimly. 'Yes, this is\none more symptom of the system which, in the Crimea, put to death 16,000\nmen.' Scutari had given her knowledge; and it had given her power too:\nher enormous reputation was at her back--an incalculable force. Other\nwork, other duties, might lie before her; but the most urgent, the most\nobvious of all, was to look to the health of the Army.\n\nOne of her very first steps was to take advantage of the invitation\nwhich Queen Victoria had sent her to the Crimea, together with the\ncommemorative brooch. Within a few weeks of her return she visited\nBalmoral, and had several interviews with both the Queen and the Prince,\nConsort. 'She put before us,' wrote the Prince in his diary, 'all the\ndefects of our present military hospital system, and the reforms that\nare needed.' She related 'the whole story' of her experiences in the\nEast; and, in addition, she managed to have some long and confidential\ntalks with His Royal Highness on metaphysics and religion. The\nimpression which she created was excellent. 'Sie gefallt uns sehr,'\nnoted the Prince, 'ist sehr bescheiden.' Her Majesty's comment was\ndifferent--'Such a HEAD! I wish we had her at the War Office.'\n\nBut Miss Nightingale was not at the War Office, and for a very simple\nreason: she was a woman. Lord Panmure, however, was (though indeed the\nreason for that was not quite so simple); and it was upon Lord Panmure\nthat the issue of Miss Nightingale's efforts for reform must primarily\ndepend. That burly Scottish nobleman had not, in spite of his most\nearnest endeavours, had a very easy time of it as Secretary of State for\nWar. He had come into office in the middle of the Sebastopol Campaign,\nand had felt himself very well fitted for the position, since he had\nacquired in former days an inside knowledge of the Army--as a Captain of\nHussars. It was this inside knowledge which had enabled him to inform\nMiss Nightingale with such authority that 'the British soldier is not a\nremitting animal'. And perhaps it was this same consciousness of a\ncommand of his subject which had impelled him to write a dispatch to\nLord Raglan, blandly informing the Commander-in-Chief in the Field just\nhow he was neglecting his duties, and pointing out to him that if he\nwould only try he really might do a little better next time.\n\nLord Raglan's reply, calculated as it was to make its recipient sink\ninto the earth, did not quite have that effect upon Lord Panmure, who,\nwhatever might have been his faults, had never been accused of being\nsupersensitive. However, he allowed the matter to drop; and a little\nlater Lord Raglan died--worn out, some people said, by work and anxiety.\nHe was succeeded by an excellent red-nosed old gentleman, General\nSimpson, whom nobody has ever heard of, and who took Sebastopol. But\nLord Panmure's relations with him were hardly more satisfactory than his\nrelations with Lord Raglan; for, while Lord Raglan had been too\nindependent, poor General Simpson erred in the opposite direction,\nperpetually asked advice, suffered from lumbago, doubted (his nose\ngrowingredder and redder daily) whether he was fit for his post, and, by\nalternate mails, sent in and withdrew his resignation. Then, too, both\nthe General and the Minister suffered acutely from that distressingly\nuseful new invention, the electric telegraph. On one occasion General\nSimpson felt obliged actually to expostulate. 'I think, my Lord,' he\nwrote, 'that some telegraphic messages reach us that cannot be sent\nunder due authority, and are perhaps unknown to you, although under the\nprotection of your Lordship's name.\n\nFor instance, I was called up last night, a dragoon having come express\nwith a telegraphic message in these words, \"Lord Panmure to General\nSimpson--Captain Jarvis has been bitten by a centipede. How is he now?\"'\nGeneral Simpson might have put up with this, though to be sure it did\nseem 'rather too trifling an affair to call for a dragoon to ride a\ncouple of miles in the dark that he may knock up the Commander of the\nArmy out of the very small allowance of sleep permitted; but what was\nreally more than he could bear was to find 'upon sending in the morning\nanother mounted dragoon to inquire after Captain Jarvis, four miles off,\nthat he never has been bitten at all, but has had a boil, from which he\nis fast recovering'. But Lord Panmure had troubles of his own. His\nfavourite nephew, Captain Dowbiggin, was at the front, and to one of his\ntelegrams to the Commander-in-Chief the Minister had taken occasion to\nappend the following carefully qualified sentence--'I recommend\nDowbiggin to your notice, should you have a vacancy, and if he is fit'.\nUnfortunately, in those early days, it was left to the discretion of the\ntelegraphist to compress the messages which passed through his hands; so\nthat the result was that Lord Panmure's delicate appeal reached its\ndestination in the laconic form of 'Look after Dowb'. The Headquarters\nStaff were at first extremely puzzled; they were at last extremely\namused. The story spread; and 'Look after Dowb' remained for many years\nthe familiar formula for describing official hints in favour of\ndeserving nephews.\n\nAnd now that all this was over, now that Sebastopol had been, somehow or\nanother, taken; now that peace was, somehow or another, made; now that\nthe troubles of office might surely be expected to be at an end at\nlast--here was Miss Nightingale breaking in upon the scene with her talk\nabout the state of the hospitals and the necessity for sanitary reform.\nIt was most irksome; and Lord Panmure almost began to wish that he was\nengaged upon some more congenial occupation--discussing, perhaps, the\nconstitution of the Free Church of Scotland--a question in which he was\nprofoundly interested. But no; duty was paramount; and he set himself,\nwith a sigh of resignation, to the task of doing as little of it as he\npossibly could.\n\n'The Bison' his friends called him; and the name fitted both his\nphysical demeanour and his habit of mind. That large low head seemed to\nhave been created for butting rather than for anything else. There he\nstood, four-square and menacing in the doorway of reform; and it\nremained to be seen whether, the bulky mass, upon whose solid hide even\nthe barbed arrows of Lord Raglan's scorn had made no mark, would prove\namenable to the pressure of Miss Nightingale. Nor was he alone in the\ndoorway. There loomed behind him the whole phalanx of professional\nconservatism, the stubborn supporters of the out-of-date, the\nworshippers and the victims of War Office routine. Among these it was\nonly natural that Dr. Andrew Smith, the head of the Army Medical\nDepartment, should have been pre-eminent--Dr. Andrew Smith, who had\nassured Miss Nightingale before she left England that 'nothing was\nwanted at Scutari'. Such were her opponents; but she too was not without\nallies. She had gained the ear of Royalty--which was something; at any\nmoment that she pleased she could gain the ear of the public--which was\na great deal. She had a host of admirers and friends; and--to say\nnothing of her personal qualities--her knowledge, her tenacity, her\ntact--she possessed, too, one advantage which then, far more even than\nnow, carried an immense weight--she belonged to the highest circle of\nsociety. She moved naturally among Peers and Cabinet Ministers--she was\none of their own set; and in those days their set was a very narrow one.\nWhat kind of attention would such persons have paid to some middle-class\nwoman with whom they were not acquainted, who possessed great experience\nof Army nursing and had decided views upon hospital reform? They would\nhave politely ignored her; but it was impossible to ignore Flo\nNightingale. When she spoke, they were obliged to listen; and, when they\nhad once begun to do that--what might not follow? She knew her power,\nand she used it. She supported her weightiest minutes with familiar\nwitty little notes. The Bison began to look grave. It might be\ndifficult--it might be damned difficult--to put down one's head against\nthe white hand of a lady ...\n\nOf Miss Nightingale's friends, the most important was Sidney Herbert. He\nwas a man upon whom the good fairies seemed to have showered, as he lay\nin his cradle, all their most enviable goods. Well born, handsome, rich,\nthe master of Wilton--one of those great country-houses, clothed with\nthe glamour of a historic past, which are the peculiar glory of\nEngland--he possessed--besides all these advantages: so charming, so\nlively, so gentle a disposition that no one who had once come near him\ncould ever be his enemy.\n\nHe was, in fact, a man of whom it was difficult not to say that he was a\nperfect English gentleman. For his virtues were equal even to his good\nfortune. He was religious, deeply religious. 'I am more and more\nconvinced every day,' he wrote, when he had been for some years a\nCabinet Minister, 'that in politics, as in everything else, nothing can\nbe right which is not in accordance with the spirit of the Gospel.' No\none was more unselfish; he was charitable and benevolent to a remarkable\ndegree; and he devoted the whole of his life, with an unwavering\nconscientiousness, to the public service. With such a character, with\nsuch opportunities, what high hopes must have danced before him, what\nradiant visions of accomplished duties, of ever-increasing usefulness,\nof beneficent power, of the consciousness of disinterested success! Some\nof those hopes and visions were, indeed, realised; but, in the end, the\ncareer of Sidney Herbert seemed to show that, with all their generosity,\nthere was some gift or other--what was it?--some essential gift--which\nthe good fairies had withheld, and that even the qualities of a perfect\nEnglish gentleman may be no safeguard against anguish, humiliation, and\ndefeat.\n\nThat career would certainly have been very different if he had never\nknown Miss Nightingale. The alliance between them which had begun with\nher appointment to Scutari, which had grown closer and closer while the\nwar lasted, developed, after her return, into one of the most\nextraordinary friendships. It was the friendship of a man and a woman\nintimately bound together by their devotion to a public cause; mutual\naffection, of course, played a part in it, but it was an incidental\npart; the whole soul of the relationship was a community of work.\nPerhaps out of England such an intimacy could hardly have existed--an\nintimacy so utterly untinctured not only by passion itself but by the\nsuspicion of it. For years Sidney Herbert saw Miss Nightingale almost\ndaily, for long hours together, corresponding with her incessantly when\nthey were apart; and the tongue of scandal was silent; and one of the\nmost devoted of her admirers was his wife. But what made the connection\nstill more remarkable was the way in which the parts that were played in\nit were divided between the two. The man who acts, decides, and\nachieves; the woman who encourages, applauds, and--from a\ndistance--inspires: the combination is common enough; but Miss\nNightingale was neither an Aspasia nor an Egeria. In her case it is\nalmost true to say that the roles were reversed; the qualities of\npliancy and sympathy fell to the man, those of command and initiative to\nthe woman.\n\nThere was one thing only which Miss Nightingale lacked in her equipment\nfor public life; she had not--she never could have--the public power and\nauthority which belonged to the successful politician. That power and\nauthority Sidney Herbert possessed; that fact was obvious, and the\nconclusions no less so: it was through the man that the woman must work\nher will. She took hold of him, taught him, shaped him, absorbed him,\ndominated him through and through. He did not resist--he did not wish to\nresist; his natural inclination lay along the same path as hers; only\nthat terrific personality swept him forward at her own fierce pace and\nwith her own relentless stride. Swept him--where to? Ah! Why had he ever\nknown Miss Nightingale? If Lord Panmure was a bison, Sidney Herbert, no\ndoubt, was a stag--a comely, gallant creature springing through the\nforest; but the forest is a dangerous place. One has the image of those\nwide eyes fascinated suddenly by something feline, something strong;\nthere is a pause; and then the tigress has her claws in the quivering\nhaunches; and then--!\n\nBesides Sidney Herbert, she had other friends who, in a more restricted\nsphere, were hardly less essential to her. If, in her condition of\nbodily collapse, she were to accomplish what she was determined that she\nshould accomplish, the attentions and the services of others would be\nabsolutely indispensable. Helpers and servers she must have; and\naccordingly there was soon formed about her a little group of devoted\ndisciples upon whose affections and energies she could implicitly rely.\nDevoted, indeed, these disciples were, in no ordinary sense of the term;\nfor certainly she was no light taskmistress, and he who set out to be of\nuse to Miss Nightingale was apt to find, before he had gone very far,\nthat he was in truth being made use of in good earnest to the very limit\nof his endurance and his capacity. Perhaps, even beyond those limits;\nwhy not? Was she asking of others more than she was giving herself? Let\nthem look at her lying there pale and breathless on the couch; could it\nbe said that she spared herself? Why, then, should she spare others? And\nit was not for her own sake that she made these claims. For her own\nsake, indeed! No! They all knew it! it was for the sake of the work. And\nso the little band, bound body and soul in that strange servitude,\nlaboured on ungrudgingly.\n\nAmong the most faithful was her 'Aunt Mai', her father's sister, who\nfrom the earliest days had stood beside her, who had helped her to\nescape from the thraldom of family life, who had been with her at\nScutari, and who now acted almost the part of a mother to her, watching\nover her with infinite care in all the movements and uncertainties which\nher state of health involved. Another constant attendant was her\nbrother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney, whom she found particularly valuable\nin parliamentary affairs. Arthur Clough, the poet, also a connection by\nmarriage, she used in other ways. Ever since he had lost his faith at\nthe time of the Oxford Movement, Clough had passed his life in a\ncondition of considerable uneasiness, which was increased rather than\ndiminished by the practice of poetry. Unable to decide upon the purpose\nof an existence whose savour had fled together with his belief in the\nResurrection, his spirits lowered still further by ill-health, and his\nincome not all that it should be, he had determined to seek the solution\nof his difficulties in the United States of America. But, even there,\nthe solution was not forthcoming; and, when, a little later, he was\noffered a post in a government department at home, he accepted it, came\nto live in London, and immediately fell under the influence of Miss\nNightingale. Though the purpose of existence might be still uncertain\nand its nature still unsavoury, here, at any rate, under the eye of this\ninspired woman, was something real, something earnest: his only doubt\nwas--could he be of any use? Certainly he could. There were a great\nnumber of miscellaneous little jobs which there was nobody handy to do.\nFor instance, when Miss Nightingale was travelling, there were the\nrailway-tickets to be taken; and there were proof-sheets to be\ncorrected; and then there were parcels to be done up in brown paper, and\ncarried to the post. Certainly he could be useful. And so, upon such\noccupations as these, Arthur Clough was set to work. 'This that I see,\nis not all,' he comforted himself by reflecting, 'and this that I do is\nbut little; nevertheless it is good, though there is better than it.' As\ntime went on, her 'Cabinet', as she called it, grew larger. Officials\nwith whom her work brought her into touch and who sympathised with her\nobjects, were pressed into her service; and old friends of the Crimean\ndays gathered around her when they returned to England. Among these the\nmost indefatigable was Dr. Sutherland, a sanitary expert, who for more\nthan thirty years acted as her confidential private secretary, and\nsurrendered to her purposes literally the whole of his life. Thus\nsustained and assisted, thus slaved for and adored, she prepared to\nbeard the Bison.\n\nTwo facts soon emerged, and all that followed turned upon them. It\nbecame clear, in the first place, that that imposing mass was not\nimmovable, and, in the second, that its movement, when it did move,\nwould be exceeding slow. The Bison was no match for the Lady. It was in\nvain that he put down his head and planted his feet in the earth; he\ncould not withstand her; the white hand forced him back. But the process\nwas an extraordinarily gradual one. Dr. Andrew Smith and all his War\nOffice phalanx stood behind, blocking the way; the poor Bison groaned\ninwardly, and cast a wistful eye towards the happy pastures of the Free\nChurch of Scotland; then slowly, with infinite reluctance, step by step,\nhe retreated, disputing every inch of the ground.\n\nThe first great measure, which, supported as it was by the Queen, the\nCabinet, and the united opinion of the country, it was impossible to\nresist, was the appointment of a Royal Commission to report upon the\nhealth of the Army. The question of the composition of the Commission\nthen immediately arose; and it was over this matter that the first\nhand-to-hand encounter between Lord Panmure and Miss Nightingale took\nplace. They met, and Miss Nightingale was victorious; Sidney Herbert was\nappointed Chairman; and, in the end, the only member of the Commission\nopposed to her views was Dr. Andrew Smith. During the interview, Miss\nNightingale made an important discovery: she found that 'the Bison was\nbullyable'--the hide was the hide of a Mexican buffalo, but the spirit\nwas the spirit of an Alderney calf. And there was one thing above all\nothers which the huge creature dreaded--an appeal to public opinion. The\nfaintest hint of such a terrible eventuality made his heart dissolve\nwithin him; he would agree to anything he would cut short his\ngrouse-shooting--he would make a speech in the House of Lords, he would\neven overrule Dr. Andrew Smith--rather than that. Miss Nightingale held\nthe fearful threat in reserve--she would speak out what she knew; she\nwould publish the truth to the whole world, and let the whole world\njudge between them. With supreme skill, she kept this sword of Damocles\npoised above the Bison's head, and more than once she was actually on\nthe point of really dropping it--for his recalcitrancy grew and grew.\n\nThe personnel of the Commission once determined upon, there was a\nstruggle, which lasted for six months, over the nature of its powers.\nWas it to be an efficient body, armed with the right of full inquiry and\nwide examination, or was it to be a polite official contrivance for\nexonerating Dr. Andrew Smith? The War Office phalanx closed its ranks,\nand fought tooth and nail; but it was defeated: the Bison was bullyable.\n'Three months from this day,' Miss Nightingale had written at last, 'I\npublish my experience of the Crimean Campaign, and my suggestions for\nimprovement, unless there has been a fair and tangible pledge by that\ntime for reform.'\n\nWho could face that?\n\nAnd, if the need came, she meant to be as good as her word. For she had\nnow determined, whatever might be the fate of the Commission, to draw up\nher own report upon the questions at issue. The labour involved was\nenormous; her health was almost desperate; but she did not flinch, and\nafter six months of incredible industry she had put together and written\nwith her own hand her Notes affecting the Health, Efficiency, and\nHospital Administration of the British Army. This extraordinary\ncomposition, filling more than 800 closely printed pages, laying down\nvast principles of far-reaching reform, discussing the minutest details\nof a multitude of controversial subjects, containing an enormous mass of\ninformation of the most varied kinds--military, statistical, sanitary,\narchitectural--was never given to the public, for the need never came;\nbut it formed the basis of the Report of the Royal Commission; and it\nremains to this day the leading authority on the medical administration\nof armies.\n\nBefore it had been completed, the struggle over the powers of the\nCommission had been brought to a victorious close. Lord Panmure had\ngiven way once more; he had immediately hurried to the Queen to obtain\nher consent; and only then, when Her Majesty's initials had been\nirrevocably affixed to the fatal document, did he dare to tell Dr.\nAndrew Smith what he had done. The Commission met, and another immense\nload fell upon Miss Nightingale's shoulders. Today she would, of course,\nhave been one of the Commission herself; but at that time the idea of a\nwoman appearing in such a capacity was unheard of; and no one even\nsuggested the possibility of Miss Nightingale's doing so. The result was\nthat she was obliged to remain behind the scenes throughout, to coach\nSidney Herbert in private at every important juncture, and to convey to\nhim and to her other friends upon the Commission the vast funds of her\nexpert knowledge--so essential in the examination of witnesses--by means\nof innumerable consultations, letters, and memoranda. It was even\ndoubtful whether the proprieties would admit of her giving evidence; and\nat last, as a compromise, her modesty only allowed her to do so in the\nform of written answers to written questions. At length, the grand\naffair was finished. The Commission's Report, embodying almost word for\nword the suggestions of Miss Nightingale, was drawn up by Sidney\nHerbert. Only one question remained to be answered--would anything,\nafter all, be done? Or would the Royal Commission, like so many other\nRoyal Commissions before and since, turn out to have achieved nothing\nbut the concoction of a very fat bluebook on a very high shelf?\n\nAnd so the last and the deadliest struggle with the Bison began. Six\nmonths had been spent in coercing him into granting the Commission\neffective powers; six more months were occupied by the work of the\nCommission; and now yet another six were to pass in extorting from him\nthe means whereby the recommendations of the Commission might be\nactually carried out. But, in the end, the thing was done. Miss\nNightingale seemed, indeed, during these months, to be upon the very\nbrink of death. Accompanied by the faithful Aunt Mai, she moved from\nplace to place--to Hampstead, to Highgate, to Derbyshire, to Malvern--in\nwhat appeared to be a last desperate effort to find health somewhere;\nbut she carried that with her which made health impossible. Her desire\nfor work could now scarcely be distinguished from mania. At one moment\nshe was writing a 'last letter' to Sidney Herbert; at the next she was\noffering to go out to India to nurse the sufferers in the Mutiny. When\nDr. Sutherland wrote, imploring her to take a holiday, she raved.\nRest!--\n\n'I am lying without my head, without my claws, and you all peck at me.\nIt is de rigueur, d'obligation, like the saying something to one's hat,\nwhen one goes into church, to say to me all that has been said to me 110\ntimes a day during the last three months. It is the obbligato on the\nviolin, and the twelve violins all practise it together, like the clocks\nstriking twelve o'clock at night all over London, till I say like Xavier\nde Maistre, Assez, je sais, je ne le sais que trop. I am not a penitent;\nbut you are like the R.C. confessor, who says what is de rigueur....'\n\nHer wits began to turn, and there was no holding her. She worked like a\nslave in a mine. She began to believe, as she had begun to believe at\nScutari, that none of her fellow-workers had their hearts in the\nbusiness; if they had, why did they not work as she did? She could only\nsee slackness and stupidity around her. Dr. Sutherland, of course, was\ngrotesquely muddle-headed; and Arthur Clough incurably lazy. Even Sidney\nHerbert ... oh yes, he had simplicity and candour and quickness of\nperception, no doubt; but he was an eclectic; and what could one hope\nfor from a man who went away to fish in Ireland just when the Bison most\nneeded bullying? As for the Bison himself, he had fled to Scotland where\nhe remained buried for many months. The fate of the vital recommendation\nin the Commission's Report--the appointment of four Sub-Commissions\ncharged with the duty of determining upon the details of the proposed\nreforms and of putting them into execution--still hung in the balance.\nThe Bison consented to everything; and then, on a flying visit to\nLondon, withdrew his consent and hastily returned to Scotland. Then for\nmany weeks all business was suspended; he had gout--gout in the\nhands--so that he could not write. 'His gout was always handy,' remarked\nMiss Nightingale. But eventually it was clear even to the Bison that the\ngame was up, and the inevitable surrender came.\n\nThere was, however, one point in which he triumphed over Miss\nNightingale: the building of Netley Hospital had been begun under his\norders, before her return to England. Soon after her arrival she\nexamined the plans, and found that they reproduced all the worst faults\nof an out-of-date and mischievous system of hospital construction. She\ntherefore urged that the matter should be reconsidered, and in the\nmeantime the building stopped. But the Bison was obdurate; it would be\nvery expensive, and in any case it was too late. Unable to make any\nimpression on him, and convinced of the extreme importance of the\nquestion, she determined to appeal to a higher authority. Lord\nPalmerston was Prime Minister; she had known him from her childhood; he\nwas a near neighbour of her father's in the New Forest. She went down to\nthe New Forest, armed with the plan of the proposed hospital and all the\nrelevant information, stayed the night at Lord Palmerston's house, and\nconvinced him of the necessity of rebuilding Netley.\n\n'It seems to me,' Lord Palmerston wrote to Lord Panmure, 'that at Netley\nall consideration of what would best tend to the comfort and recovery of\nthe patients has been sacrificed to the vanity of the architect, whose\nsole object has been to make a building which should cut a dash when\nlooked at from the Southampton river ... Pray, therefore, stop all\nfurther progress in the work until the matter can be duly considered.'\nBut the Bison was not to be moved by one peremptory letter, even if it\nwas from the Prime Minister. He put forth all his powers of\nprocrastination, Lord Palmerston lost interest in the subject, and so\nthe chief military hospital in England was triumphantly completed on\ninsanitary principles, with unventilated rooms, and with all the\npatients' windows facing northeast.\n\nBut now the time had come when the Bison was to trouble and to be\ntroubled no more. A vote in the House of Commons brought about the fall\nof Lord Palmerston's Government, and, Lord Panmure found himself at\nliberty to devote the rest of his life to the Free Church of Scotland.\nAfter a brief interval, Sidney Herbert became Secretary of State for\nWar. Great was the jubilation in the Nightingale Cabinet: the day of\nachievement had dawned at last. The next two and a half years (1859-61)\nsaw the introduction of the whole system of reforms for which Miss\nNightingale had been struggling so fiercely--reforms which make Sidney\nHerbert's tenure of power at the War Office an important epoch in the\nhistory of the British Army. The four Sub-Commissions, firmly\nestablished under the immediate control of the Minister, and urged\nforward by the relentless perseverance of Miss Nightingale, set to work\nwith a will. The barracks and the hospitals were remodelled; they were\nproperly ventilated and warmed and lighted for the first time; they were\ngiven a water supply which actually supplied water, and kitchens where,\nstrange to say, it was possible to cook. Then the great question of the\nPurveyor--that portentous functionary whose powers and whose lack of\npowers had weighed like a nightmare upon Scutari--was taken in hand, and\nnew regulations were laid down, accurately defining his responsibilities\nand his duties. One Sub-Commission reorganised the medical statistics of\nthe Army; another established in spite of the last convulsive efforts of\nthe Department an Army Medical School. Finally, the Army Medical\nDepartment itself was completely reorganised; an administrative code was\ndrawn up; and the great and novel principle was established that it was\nas much a part of the duty of the authorities to look after the\nsoldier's health as to look after his sickness. Besides this, it was at\nlast officially admitted that he had a moral and intellectual side.\nCoffee-rooms and reading-rooms, gymnasiums and workshops were\ninstituted. A new era did in truth appear to have begun. Already by 1861\nthe mortality in the Army had decreased by one-half since the days of\nthe Crimea. It was no wonder that even vaster possibilities began now to\nopen out before Miss Nightingale. One thing was still needed to complete\nand to assure her triumphs. The Army Medical Department was indeed\nreorganised; but the great central machine was still untouched. The War\nOffice itself--! If she could remould that nearer to her heart's\ndesire--there indeed would be a victory! And until that final act was\naccomplished, how could she be certain that all the rest of her\nachievements might not, by some capricious turn of Fortune's wheel--a\nchange of Ministry, perhaps, replacing Sidney Herbert by some puppet of\nthe permanent official gang--be swept to limbo in a moment?\n\nMeanwhile, still ravenous for yet more and more work, her activities had\nbranched out into new directions. The Army in India claimed her\nattention. A Sanitary Commission, appointed at her suggestion, and\nworking under her auspices, did for our troops there what the four\nSub-Commissions were doing for those at home. At the same time, these\nvery years which saw her laying the foundations of the whole modern\nsystem of medical work in the Army, saw her also beginning to bring her\nknowledge, her influence, and her activity into the service of the\ncountry at large. Her \"Notes on Hospitals\" (1859) revolutionised the\ntheory of hospital construction and hospital management. She was\nimmediately recognised as the leading expert upon all the questions\ninvolved; her advice flowed unceasingly and in all directions, so that\nthere is no great hospital today which does not bear upon it the impress\nof her mind. Nor was this all. With the opening of the Nightingale\nTraining School for Nurses at St. Thomas's Hospital (1860), she became\nthe founder of modern nursing.\n\nBut a terrible crisis was now fast approaching. Sidney Herbert had\nconsented to undertake the root and branch reform of the War Office. He\nhad sallied forth into that tropical jungle of festooned\nobstructiveness, of intertwisted irresponsibilities, of crouching\nprejudices, of abuses grown stiff and rigid with antiquity, which for so\nmany years to come was destined to lure reforming Ministers to their\ndoom.\n\n'The War Office,' said Miss Nightingale, 'is a very slow office, an\nenormously expensive office, and one in which the Minister's intentions\ncan be entirely negated by all his sub-departments, and those of each of\nthe sub-departments by every other.'\n\nIt was true; and of course, at the, first rumour of a change, the old\nphalanx of reaction was bristling with its accustomed spears. At its\nhead stood no longer Dr. Andrew Smith, who, some time since, had\nfollowed the Bison into outer darkness, but a yet more formidable\nfigure, the Permanent Under-Secretary himself, Sir Benjamin Hawes--Ben\nHawes the Nightingale Cabinet irreverently dubbed him 'a man remarkable\neven among civil servants for adroitness in baffling inconvenient\ninquiries, resource in raising false issues, and, in, short, a\nconsummate command of all the arts of officially sticking in the mud'.\n\n'Our scheme will probably result in Ben Hawes's resignation,' Miss\nNightingale said; 'and that is another of its advantages.' Ben Hawes\nhimself, however, did not quite see it in that light. He set himself to\nresist the wishes of the Minister by every means in his power. The\nstruggle was long, and desperate; and, as it proceeded, it gradually\nbecame evident to Miss Nightingale that something was the matter with\nSidney Herbert. What was it? His health, never very strong, was, he\nsaid, in danger of collapsing under the strain of his work. But, after\nall, what is illness, when there is a War Office to be reorganised? Then\nhe began to talk of retiring altogether from public life. The doctors\nwere consulted, and declared that, above all things, what was necessary\nwas rest. Rest! She grew seriously alarmed. Was it possible that, at the\nlast moment, the crowning wreath of victory was to be snatched from her\ngrasp? She was not to be put aside by doctors; they were talking\nnonsense; the necessary thing was not rest, but the reform of the War\nOffice; and, besides, she knew very well from her own case what one\ncould do even when one was on the point of death.\n\nShe expostulated vehemently, passionately; the goal was so near, so very\nnear; he could not turn back now! At any rate, he could not resist Miss\nNightingale. A compromise was arranged. Very reluctantly, he exchanged\nthe turmoil of the House of Commons for the dignity of the House of\nLords, and he remained at the War Office. She was delighted. 'One fight\nmore, the best and the last,' she said.\n\nFor several more months the fight did indeed go on. But the strain upon\nhim was greater even than she perhaps could realise. Besides the\nintestine war in his office, he had to face a constant battle in the\nCabinet with Mr. Gladstone--a more redoubtable antagonist even than Ben\nHawes--over the estimates. His health grew worse and worse. He was\nattacked by fainting-fits; and there were some days when he could only\njust keep himself going by gulps of brandy. Miss Nightingale spurred him\nforward with her encouragements and her admonitions, her zeal and her\nexample. But at last his spirit began to sink as well as his body. He\ncould no longer hope; he could no longer desire; it was useless, all\nuseless; it was utterly impossible. He had failed. The dreadful moment\ncame when the truth was forced upon him: he would never be able to\nreform the War Office. But a yet more dreadful moment lay behind; he\nmust go to Miss Nightingale and tell her that he was a failure, a beaten\nman.\n\n'Blessed are the merciful!' What strange ironic prescience had led\nPrince Albert, in the simplicity of his heart, to choose that motto for\nthe Crimean brooch? The words hold a double lesson; and, alas! when she\nbrought herself to realise at length what was indeed the fact and what\nthere was no helping, it was not in mercy that she turned upon her old\nfriend.\n\n'Beaten!' she exclaimed. 'Can't you see that you've simply thrown away\nthe game? And with all the winning cards in your hands! And so noble a\ngame! Sidney Herbert beaten! And beaten by Ben Hawes! It is a worse\ndisgrace ...' her full rage burst out at last, '... a worse disgrace\nthan the hospitals at Scutari.'\n\nHe dragged himself away from her, dragged himself to Spa, hoping vainly\nfor a return to health, and then, despairing, back again to England, to\nWilton, to the majestic house standing there resplendent in the summer\nsunshine, among the great cedars which had lent their shade to Sir\nPhilip Sidney, and all those familiar, darling haunts of beauty which he\nloved, each one of them, 'as if they were persons'; and at, Wilton he\ndied. After having received the Eucharist, he had become perfectly calm;\nthen, almost unconscious, his lips were seen to be moving. Those about\nhim bent down. 'Poor Florence! Poor Florence!' they just caught.' ...\nOur joint work ... unfinished ... tried to do ...' and they could hear\nno more.\n\nWhen the onward rush of a powerful spirit sweeps a weaker one to its\ndestruction, the commonplaces of the moral judgment are better left\nunmade. If Miss Nightingale had been less ruthless, Sidney Herbert would\nnot have perished; but then, she would not have been Miss Nightingale.\nThe force that created was the force that destroyed. It was her Demon\nthat was responsible. When the fatal news reached her, she was overcome\nby agony. In the revulsion of her feelings, she made a worship of the\ndead man's memory; and the facile instrument which had broken in her\nhand she spoke of forever after as her 'Master'. Then, almost at the\nsame moment, another blow fell on her. Arthur Clough, worn out by\nlabours very different from those of Sidney Herbert, died too: never\nmore would he tie up her parcels. And yet a third disaster followed. The\nfaithful Aunt Mai did not, to be sure, die; no, she did something almost\nworse: she left Miss Nightingale. She was growing old, and she felt that\nshe had closer and more imperative duties with her own family. Her niece\ncould hardly forgive her. She poured out, in one of her enormous\nletters, a passionate diatribe upon the faithlessness, the lack of\nsympathy, the stupidity, the ineptitude of women. Her doctrines had\ntaken no hold among them; she had never known one who had appris a\napprendre; she could not even get a woman secretary; 'they don't know\nthe names of the Cabinet Ministers--they don't know which of the\nChurches has Bishops and which not'. As for the spirit of\nself-sacrifice, well--Sidney Herbert and Arthur Clough were men, and\nthey indeed had shown their devotion; but women--! She would mount three\nwidow's caps 'for a sign'. The first two would be for Clough and for her\nMaster; but the third--'the biggest widow's cap of all'--would be for\nAunt Mai. She did well to be angry; she was deserted in her hour of\nneed; and after all, could she be sure that even the male sex was so\nimpeccable? There was Dr. Sutherland, bungling as usual. Perhaps even he\nintended to go off one of these days, too? She gave him a look, and he\nshivered in his shoes. No!--she grinned sardonically; she would always\nhave Dr. Sutherland. And then she reflected that there was one thing\nmore that she would always have--her work.\n\n\nIV\n\nSIDNEY HERBERT'S death finally put an end to Miss Nightingale's dream of\na reformed War Office. For a moment, indeed, in the first agony of her\ndisappointment, she had wildly clutched at a straw; she had written to\nM. Gladstone to beg him to take up the burden of Sidney Herbert's work.\nAnd Mr. Gladstone had replied with a sympathetic account of the funeral.\n\nSucceeding Secretaries of State managed between them to undo a good deal\nof what had been accomplished, but they could not undo it all; and for\nten years more (1862-72) Miss Nightingale remained a potent influence at\nthe War Office. After that, her direct connection with the Army came to\nan end, and her energies began to turn more and more completely towards\nmore general objects. Her work upon hospital reform assumed enormous\nproportions; she was able to improve the conditions in infirmaries and\nworkhouses; and one of her most remarkable papers forestalls the\nrecommendations of the Poor Law Commission of 1909. Her training, school\nfor nurses, with all that it involved in initiative, control,\nresponsibillity, and combat, would have been enough in itself to have\nabsorbed the whole efforts of at least two lives of ordinary vigour. And\nat the same time her work in connection with India, which had begun with\nthe Sanitary Commission on the Indian Army, spread and ramified in a\nmultitude of directions. Her tentacles reached the India Office and\nsucceeded in establishing a hold even upon those slippery high places.\nFor many years it was de rigueur for the newly appointed Viceroy, before\nhe left England, to pay a visit to Miss Nightingale.\n\nAfter much hesitation, she had settled down in a small house in South\nStreet, where she remained for the rest of her life. That life was a\nvery long one; the dying woman reached her ninety-first year. Her ill\nhealth gradually diminished; the crises of extreme danger became less\nfrequent, and at last altogether ceased; she remained an invalid, but an\ninvalid of a curious character--an invalid who was too weak to walk\ndownstairs and who worked far harder than most Cabinet Ministers. Her\nillness, whatever it may have been, was certainly not inconvenient. It\ninvolved seclusion; and an extraordinary, an unparalleled seclusion was,\nit might almost have been said, the mainspring of Miss Nightingale's\nlife. Lying on her sofa in the little upper room in South Street, she\ncombined the intense vitality of a dominating woman of the world with\nthe mysterious and romantic quality of a myth. She was a legend in her\nlifetime, and she knew it. She tasted the joys of power, like those\nEastern Emperors whose autocratic rule was based upon invisibility, with\nthe mingled satisfactions of obscurity and fame.\n\nAnd she found the machinery of illness hardly less effective as a\nbarrier against the eyes of men than the ceremonial of a palace. Great\nstatesmen and renowned generals were obliged to beg for audiences;\nadmiring princesses from foreign countries found that they must see her\nat her own time, or not at all; and the ordinary mortal had no hope of\never getting beyond the downstairs sitting-room and Dr. Sutherland. For\nthat indefatigable disciple did, indeed, never desert her. He might be\nimpatient, he might be restless, but he remained. His 'incurable\nlooseness of thought', for so she termed it, continued at her service to\nthe end. Once, it is true, he had actually ventured to take a holiday;\nbut he was recalled, and he did not repeat the experiment. He was wanted\ndownstairs. There he sat, transacting business answering correspondence,\ninterviewing callers, and exchanging innumerable notes with the unseen\npower above. Sometimes word came down that Miss Nightingale was just\nwell enough to see one of her visitors. The fortunate man was led up,\nwas ushered, trembling, into the shaded chamber, and, of course, could\nnever afterwards forget the interview. Very rarely, indeed, once or\ntwice a year, perhaps, but nobody could be quite certain, in deadly\nsecrecy, Miss Nightingale went out for a drive in the Park.\nUnrecognised, the living legend flitted for a moment before the common\ngaze. And the precaution was necessary; for there were times when, at\nsome public function, the rumour of her presence was spread abroad; and\nladies, mistaken by the crowd for Miss Nightingale, were followed,\npressed upon, vehemently supplicated 'Let me touch your shawl'; 'Let me\nstroke your arm'; such was the strange adoration in the hearts of the\npeople. That vast reserve of force lay there behind her; she could use\nit, if she could. But she preferred never to use it. On occasions, she\nmight hint or threaten, she might balance the sword of Damocles over the\nhead of the Bison; she might, by a word, by a glance, remind some\nrefractory Minister, some unpersuadable Viceroy, sitting in audience\nwith her in the little upper room, that she was something more than a\nmere sick woman, that she had only, so to speak, to go to the window and\nwave her handkerchief, for ... dreadful things to follow. But that was\nenough; they understood; the myth was there--obvious, portentous,\nimpalpable; and so it remained to the last.\n\nWith statesmen and governors at her beck and call, with her hands on a\nhundred strings, with mighty provinces at her feet, with foreign\ngovernments agog for her counsel, building hospitals, training\nnurses--she still felt that she had not enough to do. She sighed for\nmore worlds to conquer--more, and yet more.\n\nShe looked about her--what was left? Of course! Philosophy! After the\nworld of action, the world of thought. Having set right the health of\nthe British Army, she would now do the same good service for the\nreligious convictions of mankind. She had long noticed--with regret--the\ngrowing tendency towards free-thinking among artisans. With regret, but\nnot altogether with surprise, the current teaching of Christianity was\nsadly to seek; nay, Christianity itself was not without its defects. She\nwould rectify these errors. She would correct the mistakes of the\nChurches; she would point out just where Christianity was wrong; and she\nwould explain to the artisans what the facts of the case really were.\nBefore her departure for the Crimea, she had begun this work; and now,\nin the intervals of her other labours, she completed it. Her\n'Suggestions for Thought to the Searchers After Truth Among the Artisans\nof England' (1860), unravels, in the course of three portly volumes, the\ndifficulties hitherto, curiously enough, unsolved--connected with such\nmatters as Belief in God, the Plan of Creation, the Origin of Evil, the\nFuture Life, Necessity and Free Will, Law, and the Nature of Morality.\n\nThe Origin of Evil, in particular, held no perplexities for Miss\nNightingale. 'We cannot conceive,' she remarks, 'that Omnipotent\nRighteousness would find satisfaction in solitary existence.' This\nbeing, so, the only question remaining to be asked is: 'What beings\nshould we then conceive that God would create?' Now, He cannot create\nperfect beings, 'since, essentially, perfection is one'; if He did so,\nHe would only be adding to Himself. Thus the conclusion is obvious: He\nmust create imperfect ones. Omnipotent Righteousness, faced by the\nintolerable impasse of a solitary existence, finds itself bound by the\nvery nature of the cause, to create the hospitals at Scutari. Whether\nthis argument would have satisfied the artisans was never discovered,\nfor only a very few copies of the book were printed for private\ncirculation. One copy was sent to Mr. Mill, who acknowledged it in an\nextremely polite letter. He felt himself obliged, however, to confess\nthat he had not been altogether convinced by Miss Nightingale's proof of\nthe existence of God. Miss Nightingale was surprised and mortified; she\nhad thought better of Mr. Mill; for surely her proof of the existence of\nGod could hardly be improved upon. 'A law,' she had pointed out,\n'implies a law-giver.' Now the Universe is full of laws--the law of\ngravitation, the law of the excluded middle, and many others; hence it\nfollows that the Universe has a law-giver--and what would Mr. Mill be\nsatisfied with, if he was not satisfied with that?\n\nPerhaps Mr. Mill might have asked why the argument had not been pushed\nto its logical conclusion. Clearly, if we are to trust the analogy of\nhuman institutions, we must remember that laws are, as a matter of fact,\nnot dispensed by lawgivers, but passed by Act of Parliament. Miss\nNightingale, however, with all her experience of public life, never\nstopped to consider the question whether God might not be a Limited\nMonarchy. Yet her conception of God was certainly not orthodox. She felt\ntowards Him as she might have felt towards a glorified sanitary\nengineer; and in some of her speculations she seems hardly to\ndistinguish between the Deity and the Drains. As one turns over these\nsingular pages, one has the impression that Miss Nightingale has got the\nAlmighty too into her clutches, and that, if He is not careful, she will\nkill Him with overwork.\n\nThen, suddenly, in the very midst of the ramifying generalities of her\nmetaphysical disquisitions, there is an unexpected turn and the reader\nis plunged all at once into something particular, something personal,\nsomething impregnated with intense experience--a virulent invective upon\nthe position of women in the upper ranks of society. Forgetful alike of\nher high argument and of the artisans, the bitter creature rails through\na hundred pages of close print at the falsities of family life, the\nineptitudes of marriage, the emptinesses of convention, in the spirit of\nan Ibsen or a Samuel Butler. Her fierce pen, shaking with intimate\nanger, depicts in biting sentences the fearful fate of an unmarried girl\nin a wealthy household. It is a cri du coeur; and then, as suddenly, she\nreturns once more to instruct the artisans upon the nature of Omnipotent\nRighteousness.\n\nHer mind was, indeed, better qualified to dissect the concrete and\ndistasteful fruits of actual life than to construct a coherent system of\nabstract philosophy. In spite of her respect for Law, she was never at\nhome with a generalisation. Thus, though the great achievement of her\nlife lay in the immense impetus which she gave to the scientific\ntreatment of sickness, a true comprehension of the scientific method\nitself was alien to her spirit. Like most great men of action--perhaps\nlike all--she was simply an empiricist. She believed in what she saw,\nand she acted accordingly; beyond that she would not go. She had found\nin Scutari that fresh air and light played an effective part in the\nprevention of the maladies with which she had to deal; and that was\nenough for her; she would not inquire further; what were the general\nprinciples underlying that fact--or even whether there were any--she\nrefused to consider. Years after the discoveries of Pasteur and Lister,\nshe laughed at what she called the 'germ-fetish'. There was no such\nthing as 'infection'; she had never seen it, therefore it did not exist.\nBut she had seen the good effects of fresh air; therefore, there could\nbe no doubt about them; and therefore, it was essential that the\nbedrooms of patients should be well ventilated. Such was her doctrine;\nand in those days of hermetically scaled windows it was a very valuable\none. But it was a purely empirical doctrine, and thus it led to some\nunfortunate results. When, for instance, her influence in India was at\nits height, she issued orders that all hospital windows should be\ninvariably kept open. The authorities, who knew what an open window in\nthe hot weather meant, protested, but in vain; Miss Nightingale was\nincredulous. She knew nothing of the hot weather, but she did know the\nvalue of fresh air--from personal experience; the authorities were\ntalking nonsense; and the windows must be kept open all the year round.\nThere was a great outcry from all the doctors in India, but she was\nfirm; and for a moment it seemed possible that her terrible commands\nwould have to be put into execution. Lord Lawrence, however, was\nViceroy, and he was able to intimate to Miss Nightingale, with\nsufficient authority, that himself had decided upon the question, and\nthat his decision must stand, even against her own. Upon that she gave\nway, but reluctantly and quite unconvinced; she was only puzzled by the\nunexpected weakness of Lord Lawrence. No doubt, if she had lived today,\nand if her experience had lain, not among cholera cases at Scutari, but\namong yellow-fever cases in Panama, she would have declared fresh air a\nfetish, and would have maintained to her dying day that the only really\neffective way of dealing with disease was by the destruction of\nmosquitoes.\n\nYet her mind, so positive, so realistic, so ultra-practical, had its\nsingular revulsions, its mysterious moods of mysticism and of doubt. At\ntimes, lying sleepless in the early hours, she fell into long, strange,\nagonised meditations, and then, seizing a pencil, she would commit to\npaper the confessions of her soul. The morbid longings of her\npre-Crimean days came over her once more; she filled page after page\nwith self-examination, self-criticism, self-surrender. 'Oh Father,' she\nwrote, 'I submit, I resign myself, I accept with all my heart, this\nstretching out of Thy hand to save me.... Oh how vain it is, the vanity\nof vanities, to live in men's thoughts instead of God's!'\n\nShe was lonely, she was miserable. 'Thou knowest that through all these\nhorrible twenty years, I have been supported by the belief that I was\nworking with Thee who would bring everyone, even our poor nurses, to\nperfection'--and yet, after all, what was the result? Had not even she\nbeen an unprofitable servant? One night, waking suddenly, she saw, in\nthe dim light of the night-lamp, tenebrous shapes upon the wall. The\npast rushed back upon her. 'Am I she who once stood on that Crimean\nheight?' she wildly asked--'The Lady with a lamp shall stand.... The lamp\nshows me only my utter shipwreck.'\n\nShe sought consolation in the writings of the Mystics and in a\ncorrespondence with Mr. Jowett. For many years the Master of Balliol\nacted as her spiritual adviser. He discussed with her in a series of\nenormous letters the problems of religion and philosophy; he criticised\nher writings on those subjects with the tactful sympathy of a cleric who\nwas also a man of the world; and he even ventured to attempt at times to\ninstil into her rebellious nature some of his own peculiar suavity. 'I\nsometimes think,' he told her, 'that you ought seriously to consider how\nyour work may be carried on, not with less energy, but in a calmer\nspirit. I am not blaming the past ... But I want the peace of God to\nsettle on the future.' He recommended her to spend her time no longer in\n'conflicts with Government offices', and to take up some literary work.\nHe urged her to 'work out her notion of Divine Perfection', in a series\nof essays for Frazer's Magazine. She did so; and the result was\nsubmitted to Mr. Froude, who pronounced the second essay to be 'even\nmore pregnant than the first. I cannot tell,' he said, 'how sanitary,\nwith disordered intellects, the effects of such papers will be.'\n\nMr. Carlyle, indeed, used different language, and some remarks of his\nabout a lost lamb bleating on the mountains, having been unfortunately\nrepeated to Miss Nightingale, required all Mr. Jowett's suavity to keep\nthe peace. In a letter of fourteen sheets, he turned her attention from\nthis painful topic towards a discussion of Quietism. 'I don't see why,'\nsaid the Master of Balliol, 'active life might not become a sort of\npassive life too.' And then, he added, 'I sometimes fancy there are\npossibilities of human character much greater than have been realised.'\nShe found such sentiments helpful, underlining them in blue pencil; and,\nin return, she assisted her friend with a long series of elaborate\ncomments upon the Dialogues of Plato, most of which he embodied in the\nsecond edition of his translation. Gradually her interest became more\npersonal; she told him never to work again after midnight, and he obeyed\nher. Then she helped him to draw up a special form of daily service for\nthe College Chapel, with selections from the Psalms under the heads of\n'God the Lord, God the judge, God the Father, and God the\nFriend'--though, indeed, this project was never realised; for the Bishop\nof Oxford disallowed the alterations, exercising his legal powers, on\nthe advice of Sir Travers Twiss.\n\nTheir relations became intimate. 'The spirit of the Twenty-third Psalm\nand the spirit of the Nineteenth Psalm should be united in our lives,'\nMr. Jowett said. Eventually, she asked him to do her a singular favour.\nWould he, knowing what he did of her religious views, come to London and\nadminister to her the Holy Sacrament? He did not hesitate, and\nafterwards declared that he would always regard the occasion as a solemn\nevent in his life. He was devoted to her--though the precise nature of\nhis feelings towards her never quite transpired. Her feelings towards\nhim were more mixed. At first, he was 'that great and good man'--'that\ntrue saint, Mr. Jowett'; but, as time went on, some gall was mingled\nwith the balm; the acrimony of her nature asserted itself. She felt that\nshe gave more sympathy than she received; she was exhausted, and she was\nannoyed by his conversation. Her tongue, one day, could not refrain from\nshooting out at him: 'He comes to me, and he talks to me,' she said, 'as\nif I were someone else.'\n\n\nV\n\nAT one time she had almost decided to end her life in retirement as a\npatient at St. Thomas's Hospital. But partly owing to the persuasions of\nMr. Jowett, she changed her mind; for forty-five years she remained in\nSouth Street; and in South Street she died. As old age approached,\nthough her influence with the official world gradually diminished, her\nactivities seemed to remain as intense and widespread as before. When\nhospitals were to be built, when schemes of sanitary reform were in\nagitation, when wars broke out, she was still the adviser of all Europe.\nStill, with a characteristic self-assurance, she watched from her\nMayfair bedroom over the welfare of India. Still, with an indefatigable\nenthusiasm, she pushed forward the work, which, perhaps, was nearer to\nher heart, more completely her own, than all the rest--the training of\nnurses. In her moments of deepest depression, when her greatest\nachievements seemed to lose their lustre, she thought of her nurses, and\nwas comforted. The ways of God, she found, were strange indeed. 'How\ninefficient I was in the Crimea,' she noted. 'Yet He has raised up from\nit trained nursing.'\n\nAt other times, she was better satisfied. Looking back, she was amazed\nby the enormous change which, since her early days, had come over the\nwhole treatment of illness, the whole conception of public and domestic\nhealth--a change in which, she knew, she had played her part. One of her\nIndian admirers, the Aga Khan, came to visit her. She expatiated on the\nmarvellous advances she had lived to see in the management of\nhospitals--in drainage, in ventilation, in sanitary work of every kind.\nThere was a pause; and then, 'Do you think you are improving?' asked the\nAga Khan. She was a little taken aback, and said, 'What do you mean by\n\"improving\"?' He replied, 'Believing more in God.' She saw that he had a\nview of God which was different from hers. 'A most interesting man,' she\nnoted after the interview; 'but you could never teach him sanitation.'\n\nWhen old age actually came, something curious happened. Destiny, having\nwaited very patiently, played a queer trick on Miss Nightingale. The\nbenevolence and public spirit of that long life had only been equalled\nby its acerbity. Her virtue had dwelt in hardness, and she had poured\nforth her unstinted usefulness with a bitter smile upon her lips. And\nnow the sarcastic years brought the proud woman her punishment. She was\nnot to die as she had lived. The sting was to be taken out of her; she\nwas to be made soft; she was to be reduced to compliance and\ncomplacency. The change came gradually, but at last it was unmistakable.\nThe terrible commander who had driven Sidney Herbert to his death, to\nwhom Mr. Jowett had applied the words of Homer, amoton memaniia--raging\ninsatiably--now accepted small compliments with gratitude, and indulged\nin sentimental friendships with young girls. The author of \"Notes on\nNursing\"--that classical compendium of the besetting sins of the\nsisterhood, drawn up with the detailed acrimony, the vindictive relish,\nof a Swift--now spent long hours in composing sympathetic Addresses to\nProbationers, whom she petted and wept over in turn. And, at the same\ntime, there appeared a corresponding alteration in her physical mood.\nThe thin, angular woman, with her haughty eye and her acrid mouth, had\nvanished; and in her place was the rounded, bulky form of a fat old\nlady, smiling all day long. Then something else became visible. The\nbrain which had been steeled at Scutari was indeed, literally, growing\nsoft. Senility--an ever more and more amiable senility--descended.\nTowards the end, consciousness itself grew lost in a roseate haze, and\nmelted into nothingness.\n\nIt was just then, three years before her death, when she was\neighty-seven years old (1907), that those in authority bethought them\nthat the opportune moment had come for bestowing a public honour on\nFlorence Nightingale. She was offered the Order of Merit. That Order,\nwhose roll contains, among other distinguished names, those of Sir\nLawrence Alma Tadema and Sir Edward Elgar, is remarkable chiefly for the\nfact that, as its title indicates, it is bestowed because its recipient\ndeserves it, and for no other reason. Miss Nightingale's representatives\naccepted the honour, and her name, after a lapse of many years, once\nmore appeared in the Press. Congratulations from all sides came pouring\nin. There was a universal burst of enthusiasm--a final revivification of\nthe ancient myth. Among her other admirers, the German Emperor took this\nopportunity of expressing his feelings towards her. 'His Majesty,' wrote\nthe German Ambassador, 'having just brought to a close a most enjoyable\nstay in the beautiful neighbourhood of your old home near Romsey, has\ncommanded me to present you with some flowers as a token of his esteem.'\nThen, by Royal command, the Order of Merit was brought to South Street,\nand there was a little ceremony of presentation. Sir Douglas Dawson,\nafter a short speech, stepped forward, and handed the insignia of the\nOrder to Miss Nightingale. Propped up by pillows, she dimly recognised\nthat some compliment was being paid her. 'Too kind--too kind,' she\nmurmured; and she was not ironical.\n\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n    Sir E. Cook.

Reform was in the\nair--political, social, religious; there was even a feeling abroad that\nour great public schools were not quite all that they should be, and\nthat some change or other--no one precisely knew what--but some change\nin the system of their management, was highly desirable. Thus it was\nnatural that when the twelve noblemen and gentlemen, who had determined\nto be guided entirely by the merits of the candidates, found among the\ntestimonials pouring in upon them a letter from Dr. Hawkins, the Provost\nof Oriel, predicting that if they elected Mr. Thomas Arnold he would\n'change the face of education all through the public schools of\nEngland', they hesitated no longer; obviously, Mr. Thomas Arnold was\ntheir man. He was elected therefore; received, as was fitting, priest's\norders; became, as was no less fitting, a Doctor of Divinity; and in\nAugust, 1828, took up the duties of his office.\n\nAll that was known of the previous life of Dr. Arnold seemed to justify\nthe prediction of the Provost of Oriel, and the choice of the Trustees.\nThe son of a respectable Collector of Customs, he had been educated at\nWinchester and at Oxford, where his industry and piety had given him a\nconspicuous place among his fellow students. It is true that, as a\nschoolboy, a certain pompousness in the style of his letters home\nsuggested to the more clear-sighted among his relatives the possibility\nthat young Thomas might grow up into a prig; but, after all, what else\ncould be expected from a child who, at the age of three, had been\npresented by his father, as a reward for proficiency in his studies,\nwith the twenty-four volumes of Smollett's History of England?\n\nHis career at Oxford had been a distinguished one, winding up with an\nOriel fellowship. It was at about this time that the smooth and\nsatisfactory progress of his life was for a moment interrupted: he began\nto be troubled by religious doubts. These doubts, as we learn from one\nof his contemporaries, who afterwards became Mr. Justice Coleridge,\n\n'were not low nor rationalistic in their tendency, according to the bad\nsense of that term; there was no indisposition in him to believe merely\nbecause the article transcended his reason, he doubted the proof and the\ninterpretation of the textual authority'.\n\nIn his perturbation, Arnold consulted Keble, who was at that time one of\nhis closest friends, and a Fellow of the same College.\n\n'The subject of these distressing thoughts,' Keble wrote to Coleridge,\n'is that most awful one, on which all very inquisitive reasoning minds\nare, I believe, most liable to such temptations--I mean, the doctrine of\nthe blessed Trinity. Do not start, my dear Coleridge; I do not believe\nthat Arnold has any serious scruples of the UNDERSTANDING about it, but\nit is a defect of his mind that he cannot get rid of a certain feeling\nof objections.' What was to be done? Keble's advice was peremptory.\nArnold was 'bid to pause in his inquiries, to pray earnestly for help\nand light from above, and turn himself more strongly than ever to the\npractical duties of a holy life'. He did so, and the result was all that\ncould be wished. He soon found himself blessed with perfect peace of\nmind, and a settled conviction.\n\nOne other difficulty, and one only, we hear of at this point in his\nlife. His dislike of early rising amounted, we are told, 'almost to a\nconstitutional infirmity'. This weakness too he overcame, yet not quite\nso successfully as his doubts upon the doctrine of the Trinity. For in\nafterlife, the Doctor would often declare 'that early rising continued\nto be a daily effort to him and that in this instance he never found the\ntruth of the usual rule that all things are made easy by custom.\n\nHe married young and settled down in the country as a private tutor for\nyouths preparing for the Universities. There he remained for ten\nyears--happy, busy, and sufficiently prosperous. Occupied chiefly with\nhis pupils, he nevertheless devoted much of his energy to wider\ninterests. He delivered a series of sermons in the parish church; and he\nbegan to write a History of Rome, in the hope, as he said, that its tone\nmight be such 'that the strictest of what is called the Evangelical\nparty would not object to putting it into the hands of their children'.\nHis views on the religious and political condition of the country began\nto crystallise. He was alarmed by the 'want of Christian principle in\nthe literature of the day', looking forward anxiously to 'the approach\nof a greater struggle between good and evil than the world has yet\nseen'; and, after a serious conversation with Dr. Whately, began to\nconceive the necessity of considerable alterations in the Church\nEstablishment.\n\nAll who knew him during these years were profoundly impressed by the\nearnestness of his religious convictions and feelings, which, as one\nobserver said, 'were ever bursting forth'. It was impossible to\ndisregard his 'deep consciousness of the invisible world' and 'the\npeculiar feeling of love and adoration which he entertained towards our\nLord Jesus Christ'. 'His manner of awful reverence when speaking of God\nor of the Scriptures' was particularly striking. 'No one could know him\neven a little,' said another friend, 'and not be struck by his absolute\nwrestling with evil, so that like St. Paul, he seemed to be battling\nwith the wicked one, and yet with a feeling of God's help on his side.'\n\nSuch was the man who, at the age of thirty-three, became headmaster of\nRugby. His outward appearance was the index of his inward character;\neverything about him denoted energy, earnestness, and the best\nintentions. His legs, perhaps, were shorter than they should have been;\nbut the sturdy athletic frame, especially when it was swathed (as it\nusually was) in the flowing robes of a Doctor of Divinity, was full of\nan imposing vigour; and his head, set decisively upon the collar, stock,\nand bands of ecclesiastical tradition, clearly belonged to a person of\neminence. The thick, dark clusters of his hair, his bushy eyebrows and\ncurling whiskers, his straight nose and bulky chin, his firm and\nupward-curving lower lip--all these revealed a temperament of ardour and\ndetermination. His eyes were bright and large; they were also obviously\nhonest. And yet--why was it? Was it in the lines of the mouth or the\nfrown on the forehead?--it was hard to say, but it was\nunmistakable--there was a slightly puzzled look upon the face of Dr.\nArnold.\n\nAnd certainly, if he was to fulfil the prophecy of the Provost of Oriel,\nthe task before him was sufficiently perplexing. The public schools of\nthose days were still virgin forests, untouched by the hand of reform.\nKeate was still reigning at Eton; and we possess, in the records of his\npupils, a picture of the public school education of the early nineteenth\ncentury, in its most characteristic state. It was a system of anarchy\ntempered by despotism. Hundreds of boys, herded together in\nmiscellaneous boarding-houses, or in that grim 'Long Chamber' at whose\nname in after years aged statesmen and warriors would turn pale, lived,\nbadgered and overawed by the furious incursions of an irascible little\nold man carrying a bundle of birch-twigs, a life in which licensed\nbarbarism was mingled with the daily and hourly study of the niceties of\nOvidian verse. It was a life of freedom and terror, of prosody and\nrebellion, of interminable floggings and appalling practical jokes.\nKeate ruled, unaided--for the undermasters were few and of no\naccount--by sheer force of character. But there were times when even\nthat indomitable will was overwhelmed by the flood of lawlessness. Every\nSunday afternoon he attempted to read sermons to the whole school\nassembled; and every Sunday afternoon the whole school assembled shouted\nhim down. The scenes in Chapel were far from edifying; while some\nantique Fellow doddered in the pulpit, rats would be let loose to scurry\namong the legs of the exploding boys. But next morning the hand of\ndiscipline would reassert itself; and the savage ritual of the\nwhipping-block would remind a batch of whimpering children that, though\nsins against man and God might be forgiven them, a false quantity could\nonly be expiated in tears and blood.\n\nFrom two sides this system of education was beginning to be assailed by\nthe awakening public opinion of the upper middle classes. On the one\nhand, there was a desire for a more liberal curriculum; on the other,\nthere was a demand for a higher moral tone. The growing utilitarianism\nof the age viewed with impatience a course of instruction which excluded\nevery branch of knowledge except classical philology; while its growing\nrespectability was shocked by such a spectacle of disorder and brutality\nas was afforded by the Eton of Keate. 'The public schools,' said the\nRev. Mr. Bowdler, 'are the very seats and nurseries of vice.'\n\nDr. Arnold agreed. He was convinced of the necessity for reform. But it\nwas only natural that to one of his temperament and education it should\nhave been the moral rather than the intellectual side of the question\nwhich impressed itself upon his mind. Doubtless it was important to\nteach boys something more than the bleak rigidities of the ancient\ntongues; but how much more important to instil into them the elements of\ncharacter and the principles of conduct! His great object, throughout\nhis career at Rugby, was, as he repeatedly said, to 'make the school a\nplace of really Christian education'. To introduce 'a religious\nprinciple into education', was his 'most earnest wish', he wrote to a\nfriend when he first became headmaster; 'but to do this would be to\nsucceed beyond all my hopes; it would be a happiness so great, that, I\nthink, the world would yield me nothing comparable to it'. And he was\nconstantly impressing these sentiments upon his pupils. 'What I have\noften said before,' he told them, 'I repeat now: what we must look for\nhere is, first, religious and moral principle; secondly, gentlemanly\nconduct; and thirdly, intellectual ability.'\n\nThere can be no doubt that Dr. Arnold's point of view was shared by the\ngreat mass of English parents. They cared very little for classical\nscholarship; no doubt they would be pleased to find that their sons were\nbeing instructed in history or in French; but their real hopes, their\nreal wishes, were of a very different kind. 'Shall I tell him to mind\nhis work, and say he's sent to school to make himself a good scholar?'\nmeditated old Squire Brown when he was sending off Tom for the first\ntime to Rugby.\n\n'Well, but he isn't sent to school for that--at any rate, not for that\nmainly. I don't care a straw for Greek particles, or the digamma; no\nmore does his mother. What is he sent to school for?... If he'll only\nturn out a brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a Christian,\nthat's all I want.'\n\nThat was all; and it was that that Dr. Arnold set himself to accomplish.\nBut how was he to achieve his end? Was he to improve the character of\nhis pupils by gradually spreading around them an atmosphere of\ncultivation and intelligence? By bringing them into close and friendly\ncontact with civilised men, and even, perhaps, with civilised women? By\nintroducing into the life of his school all that he could of the humane,\nenlightened, and progressive elements in the life of the community? On\nthe whole, he thought not. Such considerations left him cold, and he\npreferred to be guided by the general laws of Providence. It only\nremained to discover what those general laws were. He consulted the Old\nTestament, and could doubt no longer. He would apply to his scholars, as\nhe himself explained to them in one of his sermons, 'the principle which\nseemed to him to have been adopted in the training of the childhood of\nthe human race itself'. He would treat the boys at Rugby as Jehovah had\ntreated the Chosen People: he would found a theocracy; and there should\nbe judges in Israel.\n\nFor this purpose, the system, prevalent in most of the public schools of\nthe day, by which the elder boys were deputed to keep order in the\nclass-rooms, lay ready to Dr. Arnold's hand. He found the Praepostor a\nmere disciplinary convenience, and he converted him into an organ of\ngovernment. Every boy in the Sixth Form became ipso facto a Praepostor,\nwith powers extending over every department of school life; and the\nSixth Form as a body was erected into an authority responsible to the\nheadmaster, and to the headmaster alone, for the internal management of\nthe school.\n\nThis was the means by which Dr. Arnold hoped to turn Rugby into 'a place\nof really Christian education'. The boys were to work out their own\nsalvation, like the human race. He himself, involved in awful grandeur,\nruled remotely, through his chosen instruments, from an inaccessible\nheaven. Remotely--and yet with an omnipresent force. As the Israelite of\nold knew that his almighty Lawgiver might at any moment thunder to him\nfrom the whirlwind, or appear before his very eyes, the visible\nembodiment of power or wrath, so the Rugby schoolboy walked in a holy\ndread of some sudden manifestation of the sweeping gown, the majestic\ntone, the piercing glance, of Dr. Arnold. Among the lower forms of the\nschool his appearances were rare and transitory, and upon these young\nchildren 'the chief impression', we are told, 'was of extreme fear'. The\nolder boys saw more of him, but they did not see much. Outside the Sixth\nForm, no part of the school came into close intercourse with him; and it\nwould often happen that a boy would leave Rugby without having had any\npersonal communication with him at all.\n\nYet the effect which he produced upon the great mass of his pupils was\nremarkable. The prestige of his presence and the elevation of his\nsentiments were things which it was impossible to forget. In class,\nevery line of his countenance, every shade of his manner imprinted\nthemselves indelibly on the minds of the boys who sat under him. One of\nthese, writing long afterwards, has described, in phrases still\nimpregnated with awestruck reverence, the familiar details of the scene:\n'the glance with which he looked round in the few moments of silence\nbefore the lesson began, and which seemed to speak his sense of his own\nposition'--'the attitude in which he stood, turning over the pages of\nFacciolati's Lexicon, or Pole's synopsis, with his eye fixed upon the\nboy who was pausing to give an answer'--'the pleased look and the\ncheerful \"thank you\", which followed upon a successful translation'--'the\nfall of his countenance with its deepening severity, the stern elevation\nof the eyebrows, the sudden \"sit down\" which followed upon the\nreverse'--and 'the startling earnestness with which he would check in a\nmoment the slightest approach to levity'.\n\nTo be rebuked, however mildly, by Dr. Arnold was a Potable experience.\nOne boy could never forget how he drew a distinction between 'mere\namusement' and 'such as encroached on the next day's duties', nor the\ntone of voice with which the Doctor added 'and then it immediately\nbecomes what St. Paul calls REVELLING'. Another remembered to his dying\nday his reproof of some boys who had behaved badly during prayers.\n'Nowhere,' said Dr. Arnold, 'nowhere is Satan's work more evidently\nmanifest than in turning holy things to ridicule.' On such occasions, as\nanother of his pupils described it, it was impossible to avoid 'a\nconsciousness almost amounting to solemnity' that, 'when his eye was\nupon you, he looked into your inmost heart'.\n\nWith the boys in the Sixth Form, and with them alone, the severe\nformality of his demeanour was to some degree relaxed. It was his wish,\nin his relations with the Praepostors, to allow the Master to be\noccasionally merged in the Friend. From time to time, he chatted with\nthem in a familiar manner; once a term he asked them to dinner; and\nduring the summer holidays he invited them, in rotation, to stay with\nhim in Westmorland.\n\nIt was obvious that the primitive methods of discipline which had\nreached their apogee under the dominion of Keate were altogether\nincompatible with Dr. Arnold's view of the functions of a headmaster and\nthe proper governance of a public school. Clearly, it was not for such\nas he to demean himself by bellowing and cuffing, by losing his temper\nonce an hour, and by wreaking his vengeance with indiscriminate\nflagellations. Order must be kept in other ways. The worst boys were\npublicly expelled; many were silently removed; and, when Dr. Arnold\nconsidered that a flogging was necessary, he administered it with\ngravity. For he had no theoretical objection to corporal punishment. On\nthe contrary, he supported it, as was his wont, by an appeal to general\nprinciples. 'There is,' he said, 'an essential inferiority in a boy as\ncompared with a man'; and hence 'where there is no equality the exercise\nof superiority implied in personal chastisement' inevitably followed.\n\nHe was particularly disgusted by the view that 'personal correction', as\nhe phrased it, was an insult or a degradation to the boy upon whom it\nwas inflicted; and to accustom young boys to think so appeared to him to\nbe 'positively mischievous'.\n\n'At an age,' he wrote, 'when it is almost impossible to find a true,\nmanly sense of the degradation of guilt or faults, where is the wisdom\nof encouraging a fantastic sense of the degradation of personal\ncorrection? What can be more false, or more adverse to the simplicity,\nsobriety, and humbleness of mind which are the best ornaments of youth,\nand offer the best promise of a noble manhood?'\n\nOne had not to look far, he added, for 'the fruits of such a system'. In\nParis, during the Revolution of 1830, an officer observed a boy of\ntwelve insulting the soldiers, and\n\n'though the action was then raging, merely struck him with the flat part\nof his sword, as the fit chastisement for boyish impertinence. But the\nboy had been taught to consider his person sacred, and that a blow was a\ndeadly insult; he therefore followed the officer, and having watched his\nopportunity, took deliberate aim at him with a pistol and murdered him.'\n\nSuch were the alarming results of insufficient whipping.\n\nDr. Arnold did not apply this doctrine to the Praepostors, but the boys\nin the lower parts of the school felt its benefits, with a double force.\nThe Sixth Form was not only excused from chastisement; it was given the\nright to chastise. The younger children, scourged both by Dr Arnold and\nby the elder children, were given every opportunity of acquiring the\nsimplicity, sobriety, and humbleness of mind, which are the best\nornaments of youth.\n\nIn the actual sphere of teaching, Dr. Arnold's reforms were tentative\nand few. He introduced modern history, modern languages, and mathematics\ninto the school curriculum; but the results were not encouraging. He\ndevoted to the teaching of history one hour a week; yet, though he took\ncare to inculcate in these lessons a wholesome hatred of moral evil, and\nto point out from time to time the indications of the providential\ngovernment of the world, his pupils never seemed to make much progress\nin the subject. Could it have been that the time allotted to it was\ninsufficient? Dr. Arnold had some suspicions that this might be the\ncase. With modern languages there was the same difficulty. Here his\nhopes were certainly not excessive. 'I assume it,' he wrote, 'as the\nfoundation of all my view of the case, that boys at a public school\nnever will learn to speak or pronounce French well, under any\ncircumstances.' It would be enough if they could 'learn it grammatically\nas a dead language. But even this they very seldom managed to do.\n\n'I know too well, [he was obliged to confess,] that most of the boys\nwould pass a very poor examination even in French grammar. But so it is\nwith their mathematics; and so it will be with any branch of knowledge\nthat is taught but seldom, and is felt to be quite subordinate to the\nboys' main study.'\n\nThe boys' main study remained the dead languages of Greece and Rome.\nThat the classics should form the basis of all teaching was an axiom\nwith Dr. Arnold. 'The study of language,' he said, 'seems to me as if it\nwas given for the very purpose of forming the human mind in youth; and\nthe Greek and Latin languages seem the very instruments by which this is\nto be effected.' Certainly, there was something providential about\nit--from the point of view of the teacher as well as of the taught. If\nGreek and Latin had not been 'given' in that convenient manner, Dr.\nArnold, who had spent his life in acquiring those languages, might have\ndiscovered that he had acquired them in vain. As it was, he could set\nthe noses of his pupils to the grindstone of syntax and prosody with a\nclear conscience. Latin verses and Greek prepositions divided between\nthem the labours of the week.\n\nAs time went on he became, he declared, 'increasingly convinced that it\nis not knowledge, but the means of gaining knowledge which I have to\nteach'. The reading of the school was devoted almost entirely to\nselected passages from the prose writers of antiquity. 'Boys,' he\nremarked, 'do not like poetry.' Perhaps his own poetical taste was a\nlittle dubious; at any rate, it is certain that he considered the Greek\nTragedians greatly overrated, and that he ranked Propertius as 'an\nindifferent poet'. As for Aristophanes, owing to his strong moral\ndisapprobation, he could not bring himself to read him until he was\nforty, when, it is true, he was much struck by the 'Clouds'. But\nJuvenal, the Doctor could never bring himself to read at all.\n\nPhysical science was not taught at Rugby. Since, in Dr. Arnold's\nopinion, it was too great a subject to be studied en parergo, obviously\nonly two alternatives were possible: it must either take the chief place\nin the school curriculum, or it must be left out altogether. Before such\na choice, Dr. Arnold did not hesitate for a moment.\n\n'Rather than have physical science the principal thing in my son's\nmind,' he exclaimed in a letter to a friend, I would gladly have him\nthink that the sun went around the earth, and that the stars were so\nmany spangles set in the bright blue firmament. Surely the one thing\nneedful for a Christian and an English man to study is Christian, moral,\nand political philosophy.'\n\nA Christian and an Englishman! After all, it was not in the classroom,\nnor in the boarding-house, that the essential elements of instruction\ncould be imparted which should qualify the youthful neophyte to deserve\nthose names. The final, the fundamental lesson could only be taught in\nthe school chapel; in the school chapel the centre of Dr. Arnold's\nsystem of education was inevitably fixed. There, too, the Doctor himself\nappeared in the plenitude of his dignity and his enthusiasm. There, with\nthe morning sun shining on the freshly scrubbed faces of his 300 pupils,\nor, in the dusk of evening, through a glimmer of candles, his stately\nform, rapt in devotion or vibrant with exhortation, would dominate the\nscene. Every phase of the Church service seemed to receive its supreme\nexpression in his voice, his attitude, his look. During the Te Deum, his\nwhole countenance would light up; and he read the Psalms with such\nconviction that boys would often declare, after hearing him, that they\nunderstood them now for the first time.\n\nIt was his opinion that the creeds in public worship ought to be used as\ntriumphant hymns of thanksgiving, and, in accordance with this view,\nalthough unfortunately he possessed no natural gift for music, he\nregularly joined in the chanting of the Nicene Creed with a visible\nanimation and a peculiar fervour, which it was impossible to forget. The\nCommunion service he regarded as a direct and special counterpoise to\nthat false communion and false companionship, which, as he often\nobserved, was a great source of mischief in the school; and he bent\nhimself down with glistening eyes, and trembling voice, and looks of\npaternal solicitude, in the administration of the elements. Nor was it\nonly the different sections of the liturgy, but the very divisions of\nthe ecclesiastical year that reflected themselves in his demeanour; the\nmost careless observer, we are told, 'could not fail to be struck by the\ntriumphant exultation of his whole manner on Easter Sunday'; though it\nneeded a more familiar eye to discern the subtleties in his bearing\nwhich were produced by the approach or Advent, and the solemn thoughts\nwhich it awakened of the advance of human life, the progress of the\nhuman race, and the condition of the Church of England.\n\nAt the end of the evening service, the culminating moment of the week\nhad come: the Doctor delivered his sermon. It was not until then, as all\nwho had known him agreed, it was not until one had heard and seen him in\nthe pulpit, that one could fully realise what it was to be face to face\nwith Dr. Arnold. The whole character of the man--so we are\nassured--stood at last revealed. His congregation sat in fixed attention\n(with the exception of the younger boys, whose thoughts occasionally\nwandered), while he propounded the general principles both of his own\nconduct and that of the Almighty, or indicated the bearing of the\nincidents of Jewish history in the sixth century B.C. upon the conduct\nof English schoolboys in 1830. Then, more than ever, his deep\nconsciousness of the invisible world became evident; then, more than\never, he seemed to be battling with the wicked one. For his sermons ran\non the eternal themes of the darkness of evil, the craft of the tempter,\nthe punishment of obliquity, and he justified the persistence with which\nhe dwelt upon these painful subjects by an appeal to a general\nprinciple: 'The spirit of Elijah,' he said, 'must ever precede the\nspirit of Christ.'\n\nThe impression produced upon the boys was remarkable. It was noticed\nthat even the most careless would sometimes, during the course of the\nweek, refer almost involuntarily to the sermon of the past Sunday, as a\ncondemnation of what they were doing. Others were heard to wonder how it\nwas that the Doctor's preaching, to which they had attended at the time\nso assiduously, seemed, after all, to have such a small effect upon what\nthey did. An old gentleman, recalling those vanished hours, tried to\nrecapture in words his state of mind as he sat in the darkened chapel,\nwhile Dr. Arnold's sermons, with their high-toned exhortations, their\ngrave and sombre messages of incalculable import, clothed, like Dr.\nArnold's body in its gown and bands, in the traditional stiffness of a\nformal phraseology, reverberated through his adolescent ears. 'I used,'\nhe said, 'to listen to those sermons from first to last with a kind of\nawe.'\n\nHis success was not limited to his pupils and immediate auditors. The\nsermons were collected into five large volumes; they were the first of\ntheir kind; and they were received with admiration by a wide circle of\npious readers. Queen Victoria herself possessed a copy in which several\npassages were marked in pencil, by the Royal hand.\n\nDr. Arnold's energies were by no means exhausted by his duties at Rugby.\nHe became known not merely as a headmaster, but as a public man. He held\ndecided opinions upon a large number of topics; and he enunciated\nthem--based as they were almost invariably upon general principles--in\npamphlets, in prefaces, and in magazine articles, with an impressive\nself-confidence. He was, as he constantly declared, a Liberal. In his\nopinion, by the very constitution of human nature, the principles of\nprogress and reform had been those of wisdom and justice in every age of\nthe world--except one: that which had preceded the fall of man from\nParadise. Had he lived then, Dr. Arnold would have been a Conservative.\nAs it was, his Liberalism was tempered by an 'abhorrence of the spirit\nof 1789, of the American War, of the French Economistes, and of the\nEnglish Whigs of the latter part of the seventeenth century'; and he\nalways entertained a profound respect for the hereditary peerage. It\nmight almost be said, in fact, that he was an orthodox Liberal. He\nbelieved in toleration too, within limits; that is to say, in the\ntoleration of those with whom he agreed. 'I would give James Mill as\nmuch opportunity for advocating his opinion,' he said, 'as is consistent\nwith a voyage to Botany Bay.'\n\nHe had become convinced of the duty of sympathising with the lower\norders ever since he had made a serious study of the Epistle of St.\nJames; but he perceived clearly that the lower orders fell into two\nclasses, and that it was necessary to distinguish between them. There\nwere the 'good poor'--and there were the others. 'I am glad that you\nhave made acquaintance with some of the good poor,' he wrote to a\nCambridge undergraduate. 'I quite agree with you that it is most\ninstructive to visit them.' Dr. Arnold himself occasionally visited\nthem, in Rugby; and the condescension with which he shook hands with old\nmen and women of the working classes was long remembered in the\nneighbourhood. As for the others, he regarded them with horror and\nalarm. 'The disorders in our social state,' he wrote to the Chevalier\nBunsen in 1834, 'appear to me to continue unabated. You have heard, I\ndoubt not, of the Trades Unions; a fearful engine of mischief, ready to\nnot or to assassinate; and I see no counteracting power.'\n\nOn the whole, his view of the condition of England was a gloomy one. He\nrecommended a correspondent to read\n\n'Isaiah iii, v, xxii; Jeremiah v, xxii, xxx; Amos iv; and Habakkuk ii',\nadding, 'you will be struck, I think, with the close resemblance of our\nown state with that of the Jews before the second destruction of\nJerusalem'.\n\nWhen he was told that the gift of tongues had descended on the\nIrvingites at Glasgow, he was not surprised. 'I should take it,' he\nsaid, 'merely as a sign of the coming of the day of the Lord.' And he\nwas convinced that the day of the Lord was coming--'the termination of\none of the great [Greek: aiones] of the human race'. Of that he had no\ndoubt whatever; wherever he looked he saw 'calamities, wars, tumults,\npestilences, earthquakes, etc., all marking the time of one of God's\npeculiar seasons of visitation'. His only uncertainty was whether this\ntermination of an [Greek: aion] would turn out to be the absolutely\nfinal one; but that he believed 'no created being knows or can know'. In\nany case, he had 'not the slightest expectation of what is commonly\nmeant by the Millennium'. And his only consolation was that he preferred\nthe present Ministry, inefficient as it was, to the Tories.\n\nHe had planned a great work on Church and State, in which he intended to\nlay bare the causes and to point out the remedies of the evils which\nafflicted society. Its theme was to be, not the alliance or union, but\nthe absolute identity of the Church and the State; and he felt sure that\nif only this fundamental truth were fully realised by the public, a\ngeneral reformation would follow. Unfortunately, however, as time went\non, the public seemed to realise it less and less. In spite of his\nprotests, not only were Jews admitted to Parliament, but a Jew was\nactually appointed a governor of Christ's Hospital; and Scripture was\nnot made an obligatory subject at the London University.\n\nThere was one point in his theory which was not quite plain to Dr.\nArnold. If Church and State were absolutely identical, it became\nimportant to decide precisely which classes of persons were to be\nexcluded, owing to their beliefs, from the community. Jews, for\ninstance, were decidedly outside the pale; while Dissenters--so Dr.\nArnold argued--were as decidedly within it. But what was the position of\nthe Unitarians? Were they, or were they not, members of the Church of\nChrist? This was one of those puzzling questions which deepened the\nfrown upon the Doctor's forehead and intensified the pursing of his\nlips. He thought long and earnestly upon the subject; he wrote elaborate\nletters on it to various correspondents; but his conclusions remained\nindefinite. 'My great objection to Unitarianism,' he wrote, 'in its\npresent form in England, is that it makes Christ virtually dead.' Yet he\nexpressed 'a fervent hope that if we could get rid of the Athanasian\nCreed many good Unitarians would join their fellow Christians in bowing\nthe knee to Him who is Lord both of the dead and the living'. Amid these\nperplexities, it was disquieting to learn that 'Unitarianism is becoming\nvery prevalent in Boston'. He inquired anxiously as to its 'complexion'\nthere; but received no very illuminating answer. The whole matter\ncontinued to be wrapped in a painful obscurity, There were, he believed,\nUnitarians and Unitarians; and he could say no more.\n\nIn the meantime, pending the completion of his great work, he occupied\nhimself with putting forward various suggestions of a practical kind. He\nadvocated the restoration of the Order of Deacons, which, he observed,\nhad long been 'quoad the reality, dead; for he believed that 'some plan\nof this sort might be the small end of the wedge, by which Antichrist\nmight hereafter be burst asunder like the Dragon of Bel's temple'. But\nthe Order of Deacons was never restored, and Dr. Arnold turned his\nattention elsewhere, urging in a weighty pamphlet the desirabitity of\nauthorising military officers, in congregations where it was impossible\nto procure the presence of clergy, to administer the Eucharist, as well\nas Baptism. It was with the object of laying such views as these before\nthe public--'to tell them plainly', as he said, 'the evils that exist,\nand lead them, if I can, to their causes and remedies'--that he started,\nin 1831, a weekly newspaper, \"The Englishman's Register\". The paper was\nnot a success, in spite of the fact that it set out to improve its\nreaders morally and, that it preserved, in every article, an avowedly\nChristian tone. After a few weeks, and after he had spent upon it more\nthan L200, it came to an end.\n\nAltogether, the prospect was decidedly discouraging. After all his\nefforts, the absolute identity of Church and State remained as\nunrecognised as ever.\n\n'So deep', he was at last obliged to confess, 'is the distinction\nbetween the Church and the State seated in our laws, our language, and\nour very notions, that nothing less than a miraculous interposition of\nGod's Providence seems capable of eradicating it.'\n\nDr. Arnold waited in vain.\n\nBut, he did not wait in idleness. He attacked the same question from\nanother side: he explored the writings of the Christian Fathers, and\nbegan to compose a commentary on the New Testament. In his view, the\nScriptures were as fit a subject as any other book for free inquiry and\nthe exercise of the individual judgment, and it was in this spirit that\nhe set about the interpretation of them. He was not afraid of facing\napparent difficulties, of admitting inconsistencies, or even errors, in\nthe sacred text. Thus he observed that 'in Chronicles xi, 20 and xiii,\n2, there is a decided difference in the parentage of Abijah's\nmother;'--'which', he added, 'is curious on any supposition'. And at one\ntime he had serious doubts as to the authorship of the Epistle to the\nHebrews. But he was able, on various problematical points, to suggest\ninteresting solutions.\n\nAt first, for instance, he could not but be startled by the cessation of\nmiracles in the early Church; but upon consideration, he came to the\nconclusion that this phenomenon might be 'truly accounted for by the\nsupposition that none but the Apostles ever conferred miraculous powers,\nand that therefore they ceased of course, after one generation'. Nor did\nhe fail to base his exegesis, whenever possible, upon an appeal to\ngeneral principles. One of his admirers points out how Dr. Arnold\n\n'vindicated God's command to Abraham to sacrifice his son and to the\nJews to exterminate the nations of Canaan', by explaining the principles\non which these commands were given, and their reference to the moral\nstate of those to whom they were addressed--thereby educing light out of\ndarkness, unravelling the thread of God's religious education of the\nhuman race, and holding up God's marvellous counsels to the devout\nwonder and meditation of the thoughtful believer'.\n\nThere was one of his friends, however, who did not share this admiration\nfor the Doctor's methods of Scriptural interpretation. W. G. Ward, while\nstill a young man at Oxford, had come under his influence, and had been\nfor some time one of his most enthusiastic disciples. But the star of\nNewman was rising at the University; Ward soon felt the attraction of\nthat magnetic power; and his belief in his old teacher began to waver.\nIt was, in particular, Dr. Arnold's treatment of the Scriptures which\nfilled Ward's argumentative mind, at first with distrust, and at last\nwith positive antagonism. To subject the Bible to free inquiry, to\nexercise upon it the criticism of the individual judgment--where might\nnot such methods lead? Who could say that they would not end in\nSocinianism?--nay, in Atheism itself? If the text of Scripture was to be\nsubmitted to the searchings of human reason, how could the question of\nits inspiration escape the same tribunal? And the proofs of revelation,\nand even of the existence of God? What human faculty was capable of\ndeciding upon such enormous questions? And would not the logical result\nbe a condition of universal doubt?\n\n'On a very moderate computation, Ward argued, 'five times the amount of\na man's natural life might qualify a person endowed with extraordinary\ngenius to have some faint notion (though even this we doubt) on which\nside truth lies.' It was not that he had the slightest doubt of Dr.\nArnold's orthodoxy--Dr. Arnold, whose piety was universally\nrecognised--Dr. Arnold, who had held up to scorn and execration\nStrauss's Leben Jesu without reading it. What Ward complained of was the\nDoctor's lack of logic, not his lack of faith. Could he not see that if\nhe really carried out his own principles to a logical conclusion he\nwould eventually find himself, precisely, in the arms of Strauss? The\nyoung man, whose personal friendship remained unshaken, determined upon\nan interview, and went down to Rugby primed with first principles,\nsyllogisms, and dilemmas. Finding that the headmaster was busy in\nschool, he spent the afternoon reading novels on the sofa in the\ndrawing-room. When at last, late in the evening, the Doctor returned,\ntired out with his day's work, Ward fell upon him with all his vigour.\nThe contest was long and furious; it was also entirely inconclusive.\nWhen it was over, Ward, with none of his brilliant arguments disposed\nof, and none of his probing questions satisfactorily answered, returned\nto the University to plunge headlong into the vortex of the Oxford\nMovement; and Dr. Arnold, worried, perplexed, and exhausted, went to\nbed, where he remained for the next thirty-six hours.\n\nThe Commentary on the New Testament was never finished, and the great\nwork on Church and State itself remained a fragment. Dr. Arnold's active\nmind was diverted from political and theological speculations to the\nstudy of philology, and to historical composition. His Roman History,\nwhich he regarded as 'the chief monument of his historical fame', was\nbased partly upon the researches of Niebuhr, and partly upon an aversion\nto Gibbon.\n\n'My highest ambition,' he wrote, 'is to make my history the very reverse\nof Gibbon in this respect, that whereas the whole spirit of his work,\nfrom its low morality, is hostile to religion, without speaking directly\nagainst it, so my greatest desire would be, in my History, by its high\nmorals and its general tone, to be of use to the cause without actually\nbringing it forward.'\n\nThese efforts were rewarded, in 1841, by the Professorship of Modern\nHistory at Oxford. Meanwhile, he was engaged in the study of the\nSanskrit and Slavonic languages, bringing out an elaborate edition of\nThucydides, and carrying on a voluminous correspondence upon a multitude\nof topics with a large circle of men of learning. At his death, his\npublished works, composed during such intervals as he could spare from\nthe management of a great public school, filled, besides a large number\nof pamphlets and articles, no less than seventeen volumes. It was no\nwonder that Carlyle, after a visit to Rugby, should have characterised\nDr. Arnold as a man of 'unhasting, unresting diligence'.\n\nMrs. Arnold, too, no doubt agreed with Carlyle. During the first eight\nyears of their married life, she bore him six children; and four more\nwere to follow. In this large and growing domestic circle his hours of\nrelaxation were spent. There those who had only known him in his\nprofessional capacity were surprised to find him displaying the\ntenderness and jocosity of a parent. The dignified and stern headmaster\nwas actually seen to dandle infants and to caracole upon the hearthrug\non all fours. Yet, we are told, 'the sense of his authority as a father\nwas never lost in his playfulness as a companion'. On more serious\noccasions, the voice of the spiritual teacher sometimes made itself\nheard. An intimate friend described how 'on a comparison having been\nmade in his family circle, which seemed to place St. Paul above St.\nJohn,' the tears rushed to the Doctor's eyes and how, repeating one of\nthe verses from St. John, he begged that the comparison might never\nagain be made. The longer holidays were spent in Westmorland, where,\nrambling with his offspring among the mountains, gathering wild flowers,\nand pointing out the beauties of Nature, Dr. Arnold enjoyed, as he\nhimself would often say, 'an almost awful happiness'. Music he did not\nappreciate, though he occasionally desired his eldest boy, Matthew, to\nsing him the Confirmation Hymn of Dr. Hinds, to which he had become\nendeared, owing to its use in Rugby Chapel. But his lack of ear was, he\nconsidered, amply recompensed by his love of flowers: 'they are my\nmusic,' he declared. Yet, in such a matter, he was careful to refrain\nfrom an excess of feeling, such as, in his opinion, marked the famous\nlines of Wordsworth:\n\n    'To me the meanest flower that blows can give\n     Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.'\n\nHe found the sentiment morbid. 'Life,' he said, 'is not long enough to\ntake such intense interest in objects in themselves so little.' As for\nthe animal world, his feelings towards it were of a very different cast.\n'The whole subject,' he said, 'of the brute creation is to me one of\nsuch painful mystery, that I dare not approach it.' The Unitarians\nthemselves were a less distressing thought.\n\nOnce or twice he found time to visit the Continent, and the letters and\njournals recording in minute detail his reflections and impressions in\nFrance or Italy show us that Dr. Arnold preserved, in spite of the\ndistractions of foreign scenes and foreign manners, his accustomed\nhabits of mind. Taking very little interest in works of art, he was\noccasionally moved by the beauty of natural objects; but his principal\npreoccupation remained with the moral aspects of things. From this point\nof view, he found much to reprehend in the conduct of his own\ncountrymen. 'I fear,' he wrote, 'that our countrymen who live abroad are\nnot in the best possible moral state, however much they may do in\nscience or literature.' And this was unfortunate, because 'a thorough\nEnglish gentleman--Christian, manly, and enlightened--is more, I\nbelieve, than Guizot or Sismondi could comprehend; it is a finer\nspecimen of human nature than any other country, I believe, could\nfurnish'. Nevertheless, our travellers would imitate foreign customs\nwithout discrimination, 'as in the absurd habit of not eating fish with\na knife, borrowed from the French, who do it because they have no knives\nfit for use'. Places, no less than people, aroused similar reflections.\nBy Pompeii, Dr. Arnold was not particularly impressed.\n\n'There is only,' he observed, 'the same sort of interest with which one\nwould see the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah, but indeed there is less. One\nis not authorised to ascribe so solemn a character to the destruction of\nPompeii.'\n\nThe lake of Como moved him more profoundly. As he gazed upon the\noverwhelming beauty around him, he thought of 'moral evil', and was\nappalled by the contrast. 'May the sense of moral evil', he prayed, 'be\nas strong in me as my delight in external beauty, for in a deep sense of\nmoral evil, more perhaps than in anything else, abides a saving\nknowledge of God!'\n\nHis prayer was answered: Dr. Arnold was never in any danger of losing\nhis sense of moral evil. If the landscapes of Italy only served to\nremind him of it, how could he forget it among the boys at Rugby School?\nThe daily sight of so many young creatures in the hands of the Evil One\nfilled him with agitated grief.\n\n'When the spring and activity of youth,' he wrote, 'is altogether\nunsanctified by anything pure and elevated in its desires, it becomes a\nspectacle that is as dizzying and almost more morally distressing than\nthe shouts and gambols of a set of lunatics.'\n\nOne thing struck him as particularly strange: 'It is very startling,' he\nsaid, 'to see so much of sin combined with so little of sorrow.' The\nnaughtiest boys positively seemed to enjoy themselves most. There were\nmoments when he almost lost faith in his whole system of education, when\nhe began to doubt whether some far more radical reforms than any he had\nattempted might not be necessary, before the multitude of children under\nhis charge--shouting and gambolling, and yet plunged all the while deep\nin moral evil--could ever be transformed into a set of Christian\ngentlemen. But then he remembered his general principles, the conduct of\nJehovah with the Chosen People, and the childhood of the human race. No,\nit was for him to make himself, as one of his pupils afterwards\ndescribed him, in the words of Bacon, 'kin to God in spirit'; he would\nrule the school majestically from on high. He would deliver a series of\nsermons analysing 'the six vices' by which 'great schools were\ncorrupted, and changed from the likeness of God's temple to that of a\nden of thieves'. He would exhort, he would denounce, he would sweep\nthrough the corridors, he would turn the pages of Facciolati's Lexicon\nmore imposingly than ever; and the rest he would leave to the\nPraepostors in the Sixth Form.\n\nUpon the boys in the Sixth Form, indeed, a strange burden would seem to\nhave fallen. Dr. Arnold himself was very well aware of this. 'I cannot\ndeny,' he told them in a sermon, 'that you have an anxious duty--a duty\nwhich some might suppose was too heavy for your years'; and every term\nhe pointed out to them, in a short address, the responsibilities of\ntheir position, and impressed upon them 'the enormous influence' they\npossessed 'for good or for evil'. Nevertheless most youths of seventeen,\nin spite of the warnings of their elders, have a singular trick of\ncarrying moral burdens lightly. The Doctor might preach and look grave;\nbut young Brooke was ready enough to preside at a fight behind the\nChapel, though he was in the Sixth, and knew that fighting was against\nthe rules. At their best, it may be supposed that the Praepostors\nadministered a kind of barbaric justice; but they were not always at\ntheir best, and the pages of \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" show us what was\nno doubt the normal condition of affairs under Dr. Arnold, when the boys\nin the Sixth Form were weak or brutal, and the blackguard Flashman, in\nthe intervals of swigging brandy-punch with his boon companions, amused\nhimself by toasting fags before the fire.\n\nBut there was an exceptional kind of boy, upon whom the high-pitched\nexhortations of Dr. Arnold produced a very different effect. A minority\nof susceptible and serious youths fell completely under his sway,\nresponded like wax to the pressure of his influence, and moulded their\nwhole lives with passionate reverence upon the teaching of their adored\nmaster. Conspicuous among these was Arthur Clough. Having been sent to\nRugby at the age of ten, he quickly entered into every phase of school\nlife, though, we are told, 'a weakness in his ankles prevented him from\ntaking a prominent part in the games of the place'. At the age of\nsixteen, he was in the Sixth Form, and not merely a Praepostor, but head\nof the School House. Never did Dr. Arnold have an apter pupil. This\nearnest adolescent, with the weak ankles and the solemn face, lived\nentirely with the highest ends in view. He thought of nothing but moral\ngood, moral evil, moral influence, and moral responsibility. Some of his\nearly letters have been preserved, and they reveal both the intensity\nwith which he felt the importance of his own position, and the strange\nstress of spirit under which he laboured. 'I have been in one continued\nstate of excitement for at least the last three years,' he wrote when he\nwas not yet seventeen, 'and now comes the time of exhaustion.' But he\ndid not allow himself to rest, and a few months later he was writing to\na schoolfellow as follows:\n\n'I verily believe my whole being is soaked through with the wishing and\nhoping and striving to do the school good, or rather to keep it up and\nhinder it from falling in this, I do think, very critical time, so that\nmy cares and affections and conversations, thoughts, words, and deeds\nlook to that in voluntarily. I am afraid you will be inclined to think\nthis \"cant\" and I am conscious that even one's truest feelings, if very\nfrequently put out in the light, do make a bad and disagreeable\nappearance; but this, however, is true, and even if I am carrying it too\nfar, I do not think it has made me really forgetful of my personal\nfriends, such as, in particular, Gell and Burbidge and Walrond, and\nyourself, my dear Simpkinson.'\n\nPerhaps it was not surprising that a young man brought up in such an\natmosphere, should have fallen a prey at Oxford, to the frenzies of\nreligious controversy; that he should have been driven almost out of his\nwits by the ratiocinations of W. G. Ward; that he should have lost his\nfaith; that he should have spent the rest of his existence lamenting\nthat loss, both in prose and verse; and that he should have eventually\nsuccumbed, conscientiously doing up brown paper parcels for Florence\nNightingale.\n\nIn the earlier years of his headmastership Dr. Arnold had to face a good\ndeal of opposition. His advanced religious views were disliked, and\nthere were many parents to whom his system of school government did not\ncommend itself. But in time this hostility melted away. Succeeding\ngenerations of favourite pupils began to spread his fame through the\nUniversities. At Oxford especially, men were profoundly impressed by the\npious aims of the boys from Rugby. It was a new thing to see\nundergraduates going to Chapel more often than they were obliged, and\nvisiting the good poor. Their reverent admiration for Dr. Arnold was no\nless remarkable. Whenever two of his old pupils met, they joined in his\npraises; and the sight of his picture had been known to call forth, from\none who had not even reached the Sixth, exclamations of rapture lasting\nfor ten minutes and filling with astonishment the young men from other\nschools who happened to be present.\n\nHe became a celebrity; he became at last a great man. Rugby prospered;\nits numbers rose higher than ever before; and, after thirteen years as\nheadmaster, Dr. Arnold began to feel that his work there was\naccomplished, and that he might look forward either to other labours or,\nperhaps, to a dignified retirement. But it was not to be.\n\nHis father had died suddenly at the age of fifty-three from angina\npectoris; and he himself was haunted by forebodings of an early death.\nTo be snatched away without a warning, to come in a moment from the\nseductions of this World to the presence of Eternity--his most ordinary\nactions, the most casual remarks, served to keep him in remembrance of\nthat dreadful possibility. When one of his little boys clapped his hands\nat the thought of the approaching holidays, the Doctor gently checked\nhim, and repeated the story of his own early childhood; how his own\nfather had made him read aloud a sermon on the text 'Boast not thyself\nof tomorrow\"; and how, within the week, his father was dead. On the\ntitle page of his MS. volume of sermons, he was always careful to write\nthe date of its commencement, leaving a blank for that of its\ncompletion. One of his children asked him the meaning of this. 'It is\none of the most solemn things I do,' he replied, 'to write the beginning\nof that sentence, and think that I may perhaps not live to finish it.'\n\nIt was noticed that in the spring of 1842 such thoughts seemed to be\neven more frequently in his mind than usual. He was only in his\nforty-seventh year, but he dwelt darkly on the fragility of human\nexistence. Towards the end of May, he began to keep a diary--a private\nmemorandum of his intimate communings with the Almighty. Here, evening\nafter evening, in the traditional language of religious devotion, he\nhumbled himself before God, prayed for strength and purity, and threw\nhimself upon the mercy of the Most High.\n\n'Another day and another month succeed', he wrote on May 31st. 'May God\nkeep my mind and heart fixed on Him, and cleanse me from all sin. I\nwould wish to keep a watch over my tongue, as to vehement speaking and\ncensuring of others ...I would desire to remember my latter end to which\nI am approaching ... May God keep me in the hour of death, through Jesus\nChrist; and preserve me from every fear, as well as from presumption.'\n\nOn June 2nd he wrote, 'Again the day is over and I am going to rest. Oh\nLord, preserve me this night, and strengthen me to bear whatever Thou\nshalt see fit to lay on me, whether pain, sickness, danger, or\ndistress.' On Sunday, June 5th, the reading of the newspaper aroused\n'painful and solemn' reflections ... 'So much of sin and so much of\nsuffering in the world, as are there displayed, and no one seems able to\nremedy either. And then the thought of my own private life, so full of\ncomforts, is very startling.' He was puzzled; but he concluded with a\nprayer: 'May I be kept humble and zealous, and may God give me grace to\nlabour in my generation for the good of my brethren and for His Glory!'\n\nThe end of the term was approaching, and to all appearance the Doctor\nwas in excellent spirits. On June 11th, after a hard day's work, he\nspent the evening with a friend in the discussion of various topics upon\nwhich he often touched in his conversation the comparison of the art of\nmedicine in barbarous and civilised ages, the philological importance of\nprovincial vocabularies, and the threatening prospect of the moral\ncondition of the United States. Left alone, he turned to his diary.\n\n'The day after tomorrow,' he wrote, 'is my birthday, if I am permitted\nto live to see it--my forty-seventh birthday since my birth. How large a\nportion of my life on earth is already passed! And then--what is to\nfollow this life? How visibly my outward work seems contracting and\nsoftening away into the gentler employments of old age. In one sense how\nnearly can I now say, \"Vivi\". And I thank God that, as far as ambition\nis concerned, it is, I trust, fully mortified; I have no desire other\nthan to step back from my present place in the world, and not to rise to\na higher. Still there are works which, with God's permission, I would do\nbefore the night cometh.'\n\nDr. Arnold was thinking of his great work on Church and State.\n\nEarly next morning he awoke with a sharp pain in his chest. The pain\nincreasing, a physician was sent for; and in the meantime Mrs. Arnold\nread aloud to her husband the Fifty-first Psalm. Upon one of their boys\ncoming into the room,\n\n'My son, thank God for me,' said Dr. Arnold; and as the boy did not at\nonce catch his meaning, he added, 'Thank God, Tom, for giving me this\npain; I have suffered so little pain in my life that I feel it is very\ngood for me. Now God has given it to me, and I do so thank Him for it.'\n\nThen Mrs. Arnold read from the Prayer-book the 'Visitation of the Sick',\nher husband listening with deep attention, and assenting with an\nemphatic 'Yes' at the end of many of the sentences. When the physician\narrived, he perceived at once the gravity of the case: it was an attack\nof angina pectoris. He began to prepare some laudanum, while Mrs. Arnold\nwent out to fetch the children. All at once, as the medical man was\nbending over his glasses, there was a rattle from the bed; a convulsive\nstruggle followed; and, when the unhappy woman, with the children, and\nall the servants, rushed into the room, Dr. Arnold had passed from his\nperplexities forever.\n\nThere can be little doubt that what he had achieved justified the\nprediction of the Provost of Oriel that he would 'change the face of\neducation all through the public schools of England'. It is true that,\nso far as the actual machinery of education was concerned, Dr. Arnold\nnot only failed to effect a change, but deliberately adhered to the old\nsystem. The monastic and literary conceptions of education, which had\ntheir roots in the Middle Ages, and had been accepted and strengthened\nat the revival of Learning, he adopted almost without hesitation. Under\nhim, the public school remained, in essentials, a conventional\nestablishment, devoted to the teaching of Greek and Latin grammar. Had\nhe set on foot reforms in these directions, it seems probable that he\nmight have succeeded in carrying the parents of England with him. The\nmoment was ripe; there was a general desire for educational changes; and\nDr. Arnold's great reputation could hardly have been resisted. As it\nwas, he threw the whole weight of his influence into the opposite scale,\nand the ancient system became more firmly established than ever.\n\nThe changes which he did effect were of a very different nature. By\nintroducing morals and religion into his scheme of education, he altered\nthe whole atmosphere of public-school life. Henceforward the old\nrough-and-tumble, which was typified by the regime of Keate at Eton,\nbecame impossible. After Dr. Arnold, no public school could venture to\nignore the virtues of respectability. Again, by his introduction of the\nprefectorial system, Dr. Arnold produced far-reaching effects--effects\nwhich he himself, perhaps, would have found perplexing. In his day, when\nthe school hours were over, the boys were free to enjoy themselves as\nthey liked; to bathe, to fish, to ramble for long afternoons in the\ncountry, collecting eggs or gathering flowers. 'The taste of the boys at\nthis period,' writes an old Rugbaean who had been under Arnold, 'leaned\nstrongly towards flowers'. The words have an odd look today. 'The modern\nreader of \"Tom Brown's Schooldays\" searches in vain for any reference to\ncompulsory games, house colours, or cricket averages. In those days,\nwhen boys played games they played them for pleasure; but in those days\nthe prefectorial system--the system which hands over the life of a\nschool to an oligarchy of a dozen youths of seventeen--was still in its\ninfancy, and had not yet borne its fruit.\n\nTeachers and prophets have strange after-histories; and that of Dr.\nArnold has been no exception. The earnest enthusiast who strove to make\nhis pupils Christian gentlemen and who governed his school according to\nthe principles of the Old Testament, has proved to be the founder of the\nworship of athletics and the worship of good form. Upon those two poles\nour public schools have turned for so long that we have almost come to\nbelieve that such is their essential nature, and that an English public\nschoolboy who wears the wrong clothes and takes no interest in football,\nis a contradiction in terms. Yet it was not so before Dr. Arnold; will\nit always be so after him? We shall see.\n\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n    Dean Stanley. Life and Correspondence of Dr Arnold.\n    Thomas Hughes.

Passages in a Wandering Life.\n\n\n\n\nThe End of General Gordon\n\n\nDURING the year 1883 a solitary English gentleman was to be seen,\nwandering, with a thick book under his arm, in the neighbourhood of\nJerusalem. His unassuming figure, short and slight, with its\nhalf-gliding, half-tripping motion, gave him a boyish aspect, which\ncontrasted, oddly, but not unpleasantly, with the touch of grey on his\nhair and whiskers. There was the same contrast--enigmatic and\nattractive--between the sunburnt brick-red complexion--the hue of the\nseasoned traveller--and the large blue eyes, with their look of almost\nchildish sincerity. To the friendly inquirer, he would explain, in a\nrow, soft, and very distinct voice, that he was engaged in elucidating\nfour questions--the site of the Crucifixion, the line of division\nbetween the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, the identification of Gideon,\nand the position of the Garden of Eden. He was also, he would add, most\nanxious to discover the spot where the Ark first touched ground, after\nthe subsidence of the Flood: he believed, indeed, that he had solved\nthat problem, as a reference to some passages in the book which he was\ncarrying would show.\n\nThis singular person was General Gordon, and his book was the Holy\nBible.\n\nIn such complete retirement from the world and the ways of men, it might\nhave seemed that a life of inordinate activity had found at last a\nlonged-for, final peacefulness. For month after month, for an entire\nyear, the General lingered by the banks of the Jordan. But then the\nenchantment was suddenly broken. Once more adventure claimed him; he\nplunged into the whirl of high affairs; his fate was mingled with the\nfrenzies of Empire and the doom of peoples. And it was not in peace and\nrest, but in ruin and horror, that he reached his end.\n\nThe circumstances of that tragic history, so famous, so bitterly\ndebated, so often and so controversially described, remain full of\nsuggestion for the curious examiner of the past. There emerges from\nthose obscure, unhappy records an interest, not merely political and\nhistorical, but human and dramatic. One catches a vision of strange\ncharacters, moved by mysterious impulses, interacting in queer\ncomplication, and hurrying at last--so it almost seems--like creatures\nin a puppet show to a predestined catastrophe. The characters, too, have\na charm of their own: they are curiously English. What other nation on\nthe face of the earth could have produced Mr. Gladstone and Sir Evelyn\nBaring and Lord Hartington and General Gordon? Alike in their emphasis\nand their lack of emphasis, in their eccentricity and their\nconventionality, in their matter-of-factness and their romance, these\nfour figures seem to embody the mingling contradictions of the English\nspirit. As for the mise-en-scene, it is perfectly appropriate. But\nfirst, let us glance at the earlier adventures of the hero of the piece.\n\nCharles George Gordon was born in 1833. His father, of Highland and\nmilitary descent, was himself a Lieutenant-General; his mother came of a\nfamily of merchants, distinguished for their sea voyages into remote\nregions of the Globe. As a boy, Charlie was remarkable for his high\nspirits, pluck, and love of mischief. Destined for the Artillery, he was\nsent to the Academy at Woolwich, where some other characteristics made\ntheir appearance. On one occasion, when the cadets had been forbidden to\nleave the dining-room and the senior corporal stood with outstretched\narms in the doorway to prevent their exit, Charlie Gordon put his head\ndown, and, butting the officer in the pit of the stomach, projected him\ndown a flight of stairs and through a glass door at the bottom. For this\nact of insubordination he was nearly dismissed--while the captain of his\ncompany predicted that he would never make an officer. A little later,\nwhen he was eighteen, it came to the knowledge of the authorities that\nbullying was rife at the Academy. The new-comers were questioned, and\none of them said that Charlie Gordon had hit him over the head with a\nclothes-brush. He had worked well, and his record was on the whole a\ngood one; but the authorities took a serious view of the case, and held\nback his commission for six months. It was owing to this delay that he\nwent into the Royal Engineers, instead of the Royal Artillery.\n\nHe was sent to Pembroke, to work at the erection of fortifications; and\nat Pembroke those religious convictions, which never afterwards left\nhim, first gained a hold upon his mind. Under the influence of his\nsister Augusta and of a 'very religious captain of the name of Drew', he\nbegan to reflect upon his sins, look up texts, and hope for salvation.\nThough he had never been confirmed--he never was confirmed--he took the\nsacrament every Sunday; and he eagerly perused the Priceless Diamond,\nScott's Commentaries, and The Remains of the Rev. R. McCheyne. 'No\nnovels or worldly books,' he wrote to his sister, 'come up to the\nCommentaries of Scott.... I, remember well when you used to get them in\nnumbers, and I used to laugh at them; but, thank God, it is different\nwith me now. I feel much happier and more contented than I used to do. I\ndid not like Pembroke, but now I would not wish for any prettier place.\nI have got a horse and gig, and Drew and myself drive all about the\ncountry. I hope my dear father and mother think of eternal things ...\nDearest Augusta, pray for me, I beg of you.'\n\nHe was twenty-one; the Crimean War broke out; and before the year was\nover, he had managed to get himself transferred to Balaclava. During the\nsiege of Sebastopol he behaved with conspicuous gallantry. Upon the\ndeclaration of peace, he was sent to Bessarabia to assist in determining\nthe frontier between Russia and Turkey, in accordance with the Treaty of\nParis; and upon this duty he was occupied for nearly two years. Not long\nafter his return home, in 1860, war was declared upon China. Captain\nGordon was dispatched to the scene of operations, but the fighting was\nover before he arrived. Nevertheless, he was to remain for the next four\nyears in China, where he was to lay the foundations of extraordinary\nrenown.\n\nThough he was too late to take part in the capture of the Taku Forts, he\nwas in time to witness the destruction of the Summer Palace at\nPeking--the act by which Lord Elgin, in the name of European\ncivilisation, took vengeance upon the barbarism of the East.\n\nThe war was over; but the British Army remained in the country, until\nthe payment of an indemnity by the Chinese Government was completed. A\ncamp was formed at Tientsin, and Gordon was occupied in setting up huts\nfor the troops. While he was thus engaged, he had a slight attack of\nsmallpox. 'I am glad to say,' he told his sister, 'that this disease has\nbrought me back to my Saviour, and I trust in future to be a better\nChristian than I have been hitherto.'\n\nCuriously enough a similar circumstance had, more than twenty years\nearlier, brought about a singular succession of events which were now\nupon the point of opening the way to Gordon's first great adventure. In\n1837, a village schoolmaster near Canton had been attacked by illness;\nand, as in the case of Gordon, illness had been followed by a religious\nrevulsion. Hong-Siu-Tsuen--for such was his name--saw visions, went into\necstasies, and entered into relations with the Deity. Shortly\nafterwards, he fell in with a Methodist missionary from America, who\ninstructed him in the Christian religion. The new doctrine, working upon\nthe mystical ferment already in Hong's mind, produced a remarkable\nresult. He was, he declared, the prophet of God; he was more--he was the\nSon of God; he was Tien Wang, the Celestial King; he was the younger\nbrother of Jesus. The times were propitious, and proselytes soon\ngathered around him. Having conceived a grudge against the Government,\nowing to his failure in an examination, Hong gave a political turn to\nhis teaching, which soon developed into a propaganda of rebellion\nagainst the rule of the Manchus and the Mandarins. The authorities took\nfright, attempted to suppress Hong by force, and failed. The movement\nspread. By 1850 the rebels were overrunning the populous and flourishing\ndelta of the Yangtse Kiang, and had become a formidable force. In 1853\nthey captured Nankin, which was henceforth their capital. The Tien Wang,\nestablished himself in a splendid palace, and proclaimed his new\nevangel. His theogony included the wife of God, or the celestial Mother,\nthe wife of Jesus, or the celestial daughter-in-law, and a sister of\nJesus, whom he married to one of his lieutenants, who thus became the\ncelestial son-in-law; the Holy Ghost, however, was eliminated.\n\nHis mission was to root out Demons and Manchus from the face of the\nearth, and to establish Taiping, the reign of eternal peace. In the\nmeantime, retiring into the depths of his palace, he left the further\nconduct of earthly operations to his lieutenants, upon whom he bestowed\nthe title of 'Wangs' (kings), while he himself, surrounded by thirty\nwives and one hundred concubines, devoted his energies to the spiritual\nside of his mission. The Taiping Rebellion, as it came to be called, had\nnow reached its furthest extent. The rebels were even able to occupy,\nfor more than a year, the semi-European city of Shanghai. But then the\ntide turned. The latent forces of the Empire gradually asserted\nthemselves. The rebels lost ground, their armies were defeated, and in\n1859 Nankin itself was besieged, and the Celestial King trembled in his\npalace. The end seemed to be at hand, when there was a sudden twist of\nFortune's wheel. The war of 1860, the invasion of China by European\narmies, their march into the interior, and their occupation of Peking,\nnot only saved the rebels from destruction, but allowed them to recover\nthe greater part of what they had lost. Once more they seized upon the\nprovinces of the delta, once more they menaced Shanghai. It was clear\nthat the Imperial army was incompetent, and the Shanghai merchants\ndetermined to provide for their own safety as best they could. They\naccordingly got together a body of troops, partly Chinese and partly\nEuropean, and under European officers, to which they entrusted the\ndefence of the town. This small force, which, after a few preliminary\nsuccesses, received from the Chinese Government the title of the 'Ever\nVictorious Army', was able to hold the rebels at bay, but it could do no\nmore. For two years Shanghai was in constant danger. The Taipings,\nsteadily growing in power, were spreading destruction far and wide. The\nEver Victorious Army was the only force capable of opposing them, and\nthe Ever Victorious Army was defeated more often than not. Its first\nEuropean leader had been killed; his successor quarrelled with the\nChinese Governor, Li Hung Chang, and was dismissed. At last it was\ndetermined to ask the General at the head of the British Army of\nOccupation for the loan of an officer to command the force. The English,\nwho had been at first inclined to favour the Taipings, on religious\ngrounds, were now convinced, on practical grounds, of the necessity of\nsuppressing them. It was in these circumstances that, early in 1863, the\ncommand of the Ever Victorious Army was offered to Gordon. He accepted\nit, received the title of General from the Chinese authorities, and\nentered forthwith upon his new task. He was just thirty.\n\nIn eighteen months, he told Li Hung Chang, the business would be\nfinished; and he was as good as his word. The difficulties before him\nwere very great. A vast tract of country was in the possession of the\nrebels--an area, at the lowest estimate, of 14,000 square miles with a\npopulation of 20,000,000. For centuries this low-lying plain of the\nYangtse delta, rich in silk and tea, fertilised by elaborate irrigation,\nand covered with great walled cities, had been one of the most\nflourishing districts in China. Though it was now being rapidly ruined\nby the depredations of the Taipings, its strategic strength was\nobviously enormous. Gordon, however, with the eye of a born general,\nperceived that he could convert the very feature of the country which,\non the face of it, most favoured an army on the defence--its complicated\ngeographical system of interlacing roads and waterways, canals, lakes\nand rivers--into a means of offensive warfare. The force at his disposal\nwas small, but it was mobile. He had a passion for map-making, and had\nalready, in his leisure hours, made a careful survey of the country\nround Shanghai; he was thus able to execute a series of manoeuvres which\nproved fatal to the enemy. By swift marches and counter-marches, by\nsudden attacks and surprises, above all by the dispatch of armed\nsteamboats up the circuitous waterways into positions from which they\ncould fall upon the enemy in reverse, he was able gradually to force\nback the rebels, to cut them off piecemeal in the field, and to seize\nupon their cities. But, brilliant as these operations were, Gordon's\nmilitary genius showed itself no less unmistakably in other directions.\nThe Ever Victorious Army, recruited from the riff-raff of Shanghai, was\nan ill-disciplined, ill-organised body of about three thousand men,\nconstantly on the verge of mutiny, supporting itself on plunder, and, at\nthe slightest provocation, melting into thin air. Gordon, by sheer force\nof character, established over this incoherent mass of ruffians an\nextraordinary ascendancy. He drilled them with rigid severity; he put\nthem into a uniform, armed them systematically, substituted pay for\nloot, and was even able, at last, to introduce regulations of a sanitary\nkind. There were some terrible scenes, in which the General, alone,\nfaced the whole furious army, and quelled it: scenes of rage, desperation,\ntowering courage, and summary execution. Eventually he attained an\nalmost magical prestige. Walking at the head of his troops with nothing\nbut a light cane in his hand, he seemed to pass through every danger\nwith the scatheless equanimity of a demi-god. The Taipings themselves\nwere awed into a strange reverence. More than once their leaders, in a\nfrenzy of fear and admiration, ordered the sharp-shooters not to take\naim at the advancing figure of the faintly smiling Englishman.\n\nIt is significant that Gordon found it easier to win battles and to\ncrush mutineers than to keep on good terms with the Chinese authorities.\nHe had to act in cooperation with a large native force; and it was only\nnatural that the general at the head of it should grow more and more\njealous and angry as the Englishman's successes revealed more and more\nclearly his own incompetence. At first, indeed, Gordon could rely upon\nthe support of the Governor. Li Flung Chang's experience of Europeans\nhad been hitherto limited to low-class adventurers, and Gordon came as a\nrevelation.\n\n'It is a direct blessing from Heaven,' he noted in his diary, 'the\ncoming of this British Gordon.... He is superior in manner and bearing\nto any of the foreigners whom I have come into contact with, and does\nnot show outwardly that conceit which makes most of them repugnant in my\nsight.'\n\nA few months later, after he had accompanied Gordon on a victorious\nexpedition, the Mandarin's enthusiasm burst forth.\n\n'What a sight for tired eyes,' he wrote, 'what an elixir for a heavy\nheart--to see this splendid Englishman fight!... If there is anything\nthat I admire nearly as much as the superb scholarship of Tseng Kuofan,\nit is the military qualities of this fine officer. He is a glorious\nfellow!' In his emotion, Li Hung Chang addressed Gordon as his brother,\ndeclaring that he 'considered him worthy to fill the place of the\nbrother who is departed. Could I have said more in all the words of the\nworld?' Then something happened which impressed and mystified the\nsensitive Chinaman.\n\n'The Englishman's face was first filled with a deep pleasure, and then\nhe seemed to be thinking of something depressing and sad; for the\nsmile went from his mouth and there were tears in his eyes when he\nthanked me for what I had said. Can it be that he has, or has had, some\ngreat trouble in his life, and that he fights recklessly to forget it,\nor that Death has no terrors for him?'\n\nBut, as time went on, Li Hung Chang's attitude began to change. 'General\nGordon,' he notes in July, 'must control his tongue, even if he lets his\nmind run loose.' The Englishman had accused him of intriguing with the\nChinese general, and of withholding money due to the Ever Victorious\nArmy. 'Why does he not accord me the honours that are due to me, as head\nof the military and civil authority in these parts?' By September, the\nGovernor's earlier transports have been replaced by a more judicial\nframe of mind.\n\n'With his many faults, his pride, his temper, and his never-ending\ndemand for money, (for one is a noble man, and in spite of all I have\nsaid to him or about him) I will ever think most highly of him.... He is\nan honest man, but difficult to get on with.'\n\nDisagreements of this kind might perhaps have been tided over until the\nend of the campaign; but an unfortunate incident suddenly led to a more\nserious quarrel. Gordon's advance had been fiercely contested, but it\nhad been constant; he had captured several important towns; and in\nOctober he laid siege to the city of Soo-chow, once one of the most\nfamous and splendid in China. In December, its fall being obviously\nimminent, the Taiping leaders agreed to surrender it on condition that\ntheir lives were spared. Gordon was a party to the agreement, and laid\nspecial stress upon his presence with the Imperial forces as a pledge of\nits fulfilment. No sooner, however, was the city surrendered than the\nrebel 'Wangs' were assassinated. In his fury, it is said that Gordon\nsearched everywhere for Li Hung Chang with a loaded pistol in his hand.\nHe was convinced of the complicity of the Governor, who, on his side,\ndenied that he was responsible for what had happened.\n\n'I asked him why I should plot, and go around a mountain, when a mere\norder, written with five strokes of the quill, would have accomplished\nthe same thing. He did not answer, but he insulted me, and said he would\nreport my treachery, as he called it, to Shanghai and England. Let him\ndo so; he cannot bring the crazy Wangs back.'\n\nThe agitated Mandarin hoped to placate Gordon by a large gratuity and an\nImperial medal; but the plan was not successful.\n\n'General Gordon,' he writes, 'called upon me in his angriest mood. He\nrepeated his former speeches about the Wangs. I did not attempt to argue\nwith him ... He refused the 10,000 taels, which I had ready for him,\nand, with an oath, said that he did not want the Throne's medal. This is\nshowing the greatest disrespect.'\n\nGordon resigned his command; and it was only with the utmost reluctance\nthat he agreed at last to resume it. An arduous and terrible series of\noperations followed; but they were successful, and by June, 1864, the\nEver Victorious Army, having accomplished its task, was disbanded. The\nImperial forces now closed round Nankin; the last hopes of the Tien Wang\nhad vanished. In the recesses of his seraglio, the Celestial King,\njudging that the time had come for the conclusion of his mission,\nswallowed gold leaf until he ascended to Heaven. In July, Nankin was\ntaken, the remaining chiefs were executed, and the rebellion was at an\nend. The Chinese Government gave Gordon the highest rank in its military\nhierarchy, and invested him with the yellow jacket and the peacock's\nfeather. He rejected an enormous offer of money; but he could not refuse\na great gold medal, specially struck in his honour by order of the\nEmperor. At the end of the year he returned to England, where the\nconqueror of the Taipings was made a Companion of the Bath.\n\nThat the English authorities should have seen fit to recognise Gordon's\nservices by the reward usually reserved for industrious clerks was\ntypical of their attitude towards him until the very end of his career.\nPerhaps if he had been ready to make the most of the wave of popularity\nwhich greeted him on his return--if he had advertised his fame and, amid\nhigh circles, played the part of Chinese Gordon in a becoming\nmanner--the results would have been different. But he was by nature\nfarouche; his soul revolted against dinner parties and stiff shirts; and\nthe presence of ladies--especially of fashionable ladies--filled him\nwith uneasiness. He had, besides, a deeper dread of the world's\ncontaminations. And so, when he was appointed to Gravesend to supervise\nthe erection of a system of forts at the mouth of the Thames, he\nremained there quietly for six years, and at last was almost forgotten.\nThe forts, which were extremely expensive and quite useless, occupied\nhis working hours; his leisure he devoted to acts of charity and to\nreligious contemplation. The neighbourhood was a poverty-stricken one,\nand the kind Colonel, with his tripping step and simple manner, was soon\na familiar figure in it, chatting with the seamen, taking provisions to\nstarving families, or visiting some bedridden old woman to light her\nfire. He was particularly fond of boys. Ragged street arabs and rough\nsailor-lads crowded about him. They were made free of his house and\ngarden; they visited him in the evenings for lessons and advice; he\nhelped them, found them employment, corresponded with them when they\nwent out into the world. They were, he said, his Wangs. It was only by a\nsingular austerity of living that he was able to afford such a variety\nof charitable expenses. The easy luxuries of his class and station were\nunknown to him: his clothes verged upon the shabby; and his frugal meals\nwere eaten at a table with a drawer, into which the loaf and plate were\nquickly swept at the approach of his poor visitors. Special occasions\ndemanded special sacrifices. When, during the Lancashire famine, a\npublic subscription was opened, finding that he had no ready money, he\nremembered his Chinese medal, and, after effacing the inscription,\ndispatched it as an anonymous gift.\n\nExcept for his boys and his paupers, he lived alone. In his solitude, he\nruminated upon the mysteries of the universe; and those religious\ntendencies, which had already shown themselves, now became a fixed and\ndominating factor in his life. His reading was confined almost entirely\nto the Bible; but the Bible he read and re-read with an untiring,\nunending assiduity. There, he was convinced, all truth was to be found;\nand he was equally convinced that he could find it. The doubts of\nphilosophers, the investigations of commentators, the smiles of men of\nthe world, the dogmas of Churches--such things meant nothing to the\nColonel. Two facts alone were evident: there was the Bible, and there\nwas himself; and all that remained to be done was for him to discover\nwhat were the Bible's instructions, and to act accordingly. In order to\nmake this discovery it was only necessary for him to read the Bible over\nand over again; and therefore, for the rest of his life, he did so.\n\nThe faith that he evolved was mystical and fatalistic; it was also\nhighly unconventional. His creed, based upon the narrow foundations of\nJewish Scripture, eked out occasionally by some English evangelical\nmanual, was yet wide enough to ignore every doctrinal difference, and\neven, at moments, to transcend the bounds of Christianity itself. The\njust man was he who submitted to the Will of God, and the Will of God,\ninscrutable and absolute, could be served aright only by those who\nturned away from earthly desires and temporal temptations, to rest\nthemselves whole-heartedly upon the in-dwelling Spirit. Human beings\nwere the transitory embodiments of souls who had existed through an\ninfinite past, and would continue to exist through an infinite future.\nThe world was vanity; the flesh was dust and ashes.\n\n'A man,' Gordon wrote to his sister, 'who knows not the secret, who has\nnot the in-dwelling of God revealed to him, is like this--[picture of a\ncircle with Body and Soul written within it]. He takes the promises and\ncurses as addressed to him as one man, and will not hear of there being\nany birth before his natural birth, in any existence except with the\nbody he is in. The man to whom the secret (the indwelling of God) is\nrevealed is like this: [picture of a circle with soul and body enclosed\nin two separate circles].\n\nHe applies the promises to one and the curses to the other, if\ndisobedient, which he must be, except the soul is enabled by God to\nrule. He then sees he is not of this world; for when he speaks of\nhimself he quite disregards the body his soul lives in, which is\nearthly.'\n\nSuch conceptions are familiar enough in the history of religious\nthought: they are those of the hermit and the fakir; and it might have\nbeen expected that, when once they had taken hold upon his mind, Gordon\nwould have been content to lay aside the activities of his profession,\nand would have relapsed at last into the complete retirement of holy\nmeditation. But there were other elements in his nature which urged him\ntowards a very different course. He was no simple quietist. He was an\nEnglish gentleman, an officer, a man of energy and action, a lover of\ndanger and the audacities that defeat danger; a passionate creature,\nflowing over with the self-assertiveness of independent judgment and the\narbitrary temper of command.\n\nWhatever he might find in his pocket-Bible, it was not for such as he to\ndream out his days in devout obscurity. But, conveniently enough, he\nfound nothing in his pocket-Bible indicating that he should. What he did\nfind was that the Will of God was inscrutable and absolute; that it was\nman's duty to follow where God's hand led; and, if God's hand led\ntowards violent excitements and extraordinary vicissitudes, that it was\nnot only futile, it was impious to turn another way. Fatalism is always\napt to be a double-edged philosophy; for while, on the one hand, it\nreveals the minutest occurrences as the immutable result of a rigid\nchain of infinitely predestined causes, on the other, it invests the\nwildest incoherences of conduct or of circumstance with the sanctity of\neternal law. And Gordon's fatalism was no exception. The same doctrine\nthat led him to dally with omens, to search for prophetic texts, and to\nappend, in brackets, the apotropaic initials D.V. after every statement\nin his letters implying futurity, led him also to envisage his moods and\nhis desires, his passing reckless whims and his deep unconscious\ninstincts, as the mysterious manifestations of the indwelling God. That\nthere was danger lurking in such a creed he was very well aware. The\ngrosser temptations of the world--money and the vulgar attributes of\npower--had, indeed, no charms for him; but there were subtler and more\ninsinuating allurements which it was not so easy to resist. More than\none observer declared that ambition was, in reality, the essential\nmotive in his life: ambition, neither for wealth nor titles, but for\nfame and influence, for the swaying of multitudes, and for that kind of\nenlarged and intensified existence 'where breath breathes most even in\nthe mouths of men'. Was it so? In the depths of Gordon's soul there were\nintertwining contradictions--intricate recesses where egoism and\nrenunciation melted into one another, where the flesh lost itself in the\nspirit, and the spirit in the flesh. What was the Will of God? The\nquestion, which first became insistent during his retirement at\nGravesend, never afterwards left him; it might almost be said that he\nspent the remainder of his life in searching for the answer to it. In\nall his Odysseys, in all his strange and agitated adventures, a day\nnever passed on which he neglected the voice of eternal wisdom as it\nspoke through the words of Paul or Solomon, of Jonah or Habakkuk. He\nopened his Bible, he read, and then he noted down his reflections upon\nscraps of paper, which, periodically pinned together, he dispatched to\none or other of his religious friends, and particularly his sister\nAugusta. The published extracts from these voluminous outpourings lay\nbare the inner history of Gordon's spirit, and reveal the pious\nvisionary of Gravesend in the restless hero of three continents.\n\nHis seclusion came to an end in a distinctly providential manner. In\naccordance with a stipulation in the Treaty of Paris, an international\ncommission had been appointed to improve the navigation of the Danube;\nand Gordon, who had acted on a similar body fifteen years earlier, was\nsent out to represent Great Britain. At Constantinople, he chanced to\nmeet the Egyptian minister, Nubar Pasha. The Governorship of the\nEquatorial Provinces of the Sudan was about to fall vacant; and Nubar\noffered the post to Gordon, who accepted it.\n\n'For some wise design,' he wrote to his sister, 'God turns events one\nway or another, whether man likes it or not, as a man driving a horse\nturns it to right or left without consideration as to whether the horse\nlikes that way or not. To be happy, a man must be like a well-broken,\nwilling horse, ready for anything. Events will go as God likes.'\n\nAnd then followed six years of extraordinary, desperate, unceasing, and\nungrateful labour. The unexplored and pestilential region of Equatoria,\nstretching southwards to the Great Lakes and the sources of the Nile,\nhad been annexed to Egypt by the Khedive Ismail, who, while he\nsquandered his millions on Parisian ballet-dancers, dreamt strange\ndreams of glory and empire. Those dim tracts of swamp and forest in\nCentral Africa were--so he declared--to be 'opened up'; they were to\nreceive the blessings of civilisation, they were to become a source of\neternal honour to himself and Egypt. The slave-trade, which flourished\nthere, was to be put down; the savage inhabitants were to become\nacquainted with freedom, justice, and prosperity. Incidentally, a\ngovernment monopoly in ivory was to be established, and the place was to\nbe made a paying concern. Ismail, hopelessly in debt to a horde of\nEuropean creditors, looked to Europe to support him in his schemes.\nEurope, and, in particular, England, with her passion for extraneous\nphilanthropy, was not averse. Sir Samuel Baker became the first Governor\nof Equatoria, and now Gordon was to carry on the good work. In such\ncircumstances it was only natural that Gordon should consider himself a\nspecial instrument in God's band. To put his disinterestedness beyond\ndoubt, he reduced his salary, which had been fixed at L10,000, to\nL2,000. He took over his new duties early in 1874, and it was not long\nbefore he had a first hint of disillusionment. On his way up the Nile,\nhe was received in state at Khartoum by the Egyptian Governor-General of\nthe Sudan, his immediate official superior.\n\nThe function ended in a prolonged banquet, followed by a mixed ballet of\nsoldiers and completely naked young women, who danced in a circle, beat\ntime with their feet, and accompanied their gestures with a curious\nsound of clucking. At last the Austrian Consul, overcome by the\nexhilaration of the scene, flung himself in a frenzy among the dancers;\nthe Governor-General, shouting with delight, seemed about to follow\nsuit, when Gordon abruptly left the room, and the party broke up in\nconfusion.\n\nWhen, 1,500 miles to the southward, Gordon reached the seat of his\ngovernment, and the desolation of the Tropics closed over him, the\nagonising nature of his task stood fully revealed. For the next three\nyears he struggled with enormous difficulties--with the confused and\nhorrible country, the appalling climate, the maddening insects and the\nloathsome diseases, the indifference of subordinates and superiors, the\nsavagery of the slave-traders, and the hatred of the inhabitants. One by\none the small company of his European staff succumbed. With a few\nhundred Egyptian soldiers he had to suppress insurrections, make roads,\nestablish fortified posts, and enforce the government monopoly of ivory.\nAll this he accomplished; he even succeeded in sending enough money to\nCairo to pay for the expenses of the expedition. But a deep gloom had\nfallen upon his spirit. When, after a series of incredible obstacles had\nbeen overcome, a steamer was launched upon the unexplored Albert Nyanza,\nhe turned his back upon the lake, leaving the glory of its navigation to\nhis Italian lieutenant, Gessi. 'I wish,' he wrote, 'to give a practical\nproof of what I think regarding the inordinate praise which is given to\nan explorer.' Among his distresses and self-mortifications, he loathed\nthe thought of all such honours, and remembered the attentions of\nEnglish society with a snarl.\n\n'When, D.V., I get home, I do not dine out. My reminiscences of these\nlands will not be more pleasant to me than the China ones. What I shall\nhave done, will be what I have done. Men think giving dinners is\nconferring a favour on you ... Why not give dinners to those who need\nthem?'\n\nNo! His heart was set upon a very different object.\n\n'To each is allotted a distinct work, to each a destined goal; to some\nthe seat at the right hand or left hand of the Saviour. (It was not His\nto give; it was already given--Matthew xx, 23. Again, Judas went to \"HIS\nOWN PLACE\"--Acts i, 25.) It is difficult for the flesh to accept: \"Ye\nare dead, ye have naught to do with the world\". How difficult for anyone\nto be circumcised from the world, to be as indifferent to its pleasures,\nits sorrows, and its comforts as a corpse is! That is to know the\nresurrection.'\n\nBut the Holy Bible was not his only solace. For now, under the parching\nAfrican sun, we catch glimpses, for the first time, of Gordon's hand\nstretching out towards stimulants of a more material quality. For months\ntogether, we are told, he would drink nothing but pure water; and then\n... water that was not so pure. In his fits of melancholy, he would shut\nhimself up in his tent for days at a time, with a hatchet and a flag\nplaced at the door to indicate that he was not to be disturbed for any\nreason whatever; until at last the cloud would lift, the signals would\nbe removed, and the Governor would reappear, brisk and cheerful.\n\nDuring, one of these retirements, there was grave danger of a native\nattack upon the camp. Colonel Long, the Chief of Staff, ventured, after\nsome hesitation, to ignore the flag and hatchet, and to enter the\nforbidden tent. He found Gordon seated at a table, upon which were an\nopen Bible and an open bottle of brandy. Long explained the\ncircumstances, but could obtain no answer beyond the abrupt words--'You\nare commander of the camp'--and was obliged to retire, nonplussed, to\ndeal with the situation as best he could. On the following morning,\nGordon, cleanly shaven, and in the full-dress uniform of the Royal\nEngineers, entered Long's hut with his usual tripping step, exclaiming\n'Old fellow, now don't be angry with me. I was very low last night.\nLet's have a good breakfast--a little b. and s. Do you feel up to it?'\nAnd, with these veering moods and dangerous restoratives, there came an\nintensification of the queer and violent elements in the temper of the\nman.\n\nHis eccentricities grew upon him. He found it more and more\nuncomfortable to follow the ordinary course. Official routine was an\nagony to him. His caustic and satirical humour expressed itself in a\nstyle that astounded government departments. While he jibed at his\nsuperiors, his subordinates learned to dread the explosions of his\nwrath. There were moments when his passion became utterly ungovernable;\nand the gentle soldier of God, who had spent the day in quoting texts\nfor the edification of his sister, would slap the face of his Arab\naide-de-camp in a sudden access of fury, or set upon his Alsatian\nservant and kick him until he screamed.\n\nAt the end of three years, Gordon resigned his post in Equatoria, and\nprepared to return home. But again Providence intervened: the Khedive\noffered him, as an inducement to remain in the Egyptian service, a\nposition of still higher consequence--the Governor-Generalship of the\nwhole Sudan; and Gordon once more took up his task. Another three years\nwere passed in grappling with vast revolting provinces, with the\nineradicable iniquities of the slave-trade, and with all the\ncomplications of weakness and corruption incident to an oriental\nadministration extending over almost boundless tracts of savage\nterritory which had never been effectively subdued. His headquarters\nwere fixed in the palace at Khartoum; but there were various interludes\nin his government. Once, when the Khedive's finances had become\npeculiarly embroiled, he summoned Gordon to Cairo to preside over a\ncommission which should set matters to rights. Gordon accepted the post,\nbut soon found that his situation was untenable. He was between the\ndevil and the deep sea--between the unscrupulous cunning of the Egyptian\nPashas, and the immeasurable immensity of the Khedive's debts to his\nEuropean creditors. The Pashas were anxious to use him as a respectable\nmask for their own nefarious dealings; and the representatives of the\nEuropean creditors, who looked upon him as an irresponsible intruder,\nwere anxious simply to get rid of him as soon as they could. One of\nthese representatives was Sir Evelyn Baring, whom Gordon now met for the\nfirst time. An immediate antagonism flashed out between the two men. But\ntheir hostility had no time to mature; for Gordon, baffled on all sides,\nand deserted even by the Khedive, precipitately returned to his\nGovernor-Generalship. Whatever else Providence might have decreed, it\nhad certainly not decided that he should be a financier.\n\nHis tastes and his talents were indeed of a very different kind. In his\nabsence, a rebellion had broken out in Darfur--one of the vast outlying\nprovinces of his government--where a native chieftain, Zobeir, had\nerected, on a basis of slave-traffic, a dangerous military power. Zobeir\nhimself had been lured to Cairo, where he was detained in a state of\nsemi-captivity; but his son, Suleiman, ruled in his stead, and was now\ndefying the Governor-General. Gordon determined upon a hazardous stroke.\nHe mounted a camel, and rode, alone, in the blazing heat, across\neighty-five miles of desert, to Suleiman's camp. His sudden apparition\ndumbfounded the rebels; his imperious bearing overawed them; he\nsignified to them that in two days they must disarm and disperse; and\nthe whole host obeyed. Gordon returned to Khartoum in triumph. But he\nhad not heard the last of Suleiman. Flying southwards from Darfur to the\nneighbouring province of Bahr-el-Ghazal, the young man was soon once\nmore at the head of a formidable force. A prolonged campaign of extreme\ndifficulty and danger followed. Eventually, Gordon, summoned again to\nCairo, was obliged to leave to Gessi the task of finally crushing the\nrevolt. After a brilliant campaign, Gessi forced Suleiman to surrender,\nand then shot him as a rebel. The deed was to exercise a curious\ninfluence upon Gordon's fate. Though Suleiman had been killed and his\npower broken, the slave-trade still flourished in the Sudan. Gordon's\nefforts to suppress it resembled the palliatives of an empiric treating\nthe superficial symptoms of some profound constitutional disease. The\nroot of the malady lay in the slave-markets of Cairo and Constantinople:\nthe supply followed the demand. Gordon, after years of labour, might\nhere and there stop up a spring or divert a tributary, but, somehow or\nother the waters would reach the river-bed. In the end, he himself came\nto recognise this. 'When you have got the ink that has soaked into\nblotting-paper out of it,' he said, 'then slavery will cease in these\nlands.' And yet he struggled desperately on; it was not for him to\nmurmur. 'I feel my own weakness, and look to Him who is Almighty, and I\nleave the issue without inordinate care to Him.'\n\nRelief came at last. The Khedive Ismail was deposed; and Gordon felt at\nliberty to send in his resignation. Before he left Egypt, however, he\nwas to experience yet one more remarkable adventure. At his own request,\nhe set out on a diplomatic mission to the Negus of Abyssinia. The\nmission was a complete failure. The Negus was intractable, and, when his\nbribes were refused, furious. Gordon was ignominiously dismissed; every\ninsult was heaped on him; he was arrested, and obliged to traverse the\nAbyssinian Mountains in the depth of winter under the escort of a savage\ntroop of horse. When, after great hardships and dangers, he reached\nCairo, he found the whole official world up in arms against him. The\nPashas had determined at last that they had no further use for this\nhonest and peculiar Englishman. It was arranged that one of his\nconfidential dispatches should be published in the newspapers;\nnaturally, it contained indiscretions; there was a universal outcry--the\nman was insubordinate, and mad. He departed under a storm of obloquy. It\nseemed impossible that he should ever return to Egypt. On his way home\nhe stopped in Paris, saw the English Ambassador, Lord Lyons, and\nspeedily came into conflict with him over Egyptian affairs. There ensued\na heated correspondence, which was finally closed by a letter from\nGordon, ending as follows:\n\n'I have some comfort in thinking that in ten or fifteen years' time it\nwill matter little to either of us. A black box, six feet six by three\nfeet wide, will then contain all that is left of Ambassador, or Cabinet\nMinister, or of your humble and obedient servant.'\n\nHe arrived in England early in 1880 ill and exhausted; and it might have\nbeen supposed that after the terrible activities of his African exile he\nwould have been ready to rest. But the very opposite was the case; the\nnext three years were the most momentous of his life. He hurried from\npost to post, from enterprise to enterprise, from continent to\ncontinent, with a vertiginous rapidity. He accepted the Private\nSecretaryship to Lord Ripon, the new Viceroy of India, and, three days\nafter his arrival at Bombay, he resigned. He had suddenly realised that\nhe was not cut out for a Private Secretary, when, on an address being\nsent in from some deputation, he was asked to say that the Viceroy had\nread it with interest. 'You know perfectly,' he said to Lord William\nBeresford, 'that Lord Ripon has never read it, and I can't say that sort\nof thing; so I will resign, and you take in my resignation.' He\nconfessed to Lord William that the world was not big enough for him,\nthat there was 'no king or country big enough'; and then he added,\nhitting him on the shoulder, 'Yes, that is flesh, that is what I hate,\nand what makes me wish to die.'\n\nTwo days later, he was off for Pekin. 'Every one will say I am mad,'\nwere his last words to Lord William Beresford; 'but you say I am not.'\nThe position in China was critical; war with Russia appeared to be\nimminent; and Gordon had been appealed to in order to use his influence\non the side of peace. He was welcomed by many old friends of former\ndays, among them Li Hung Chang, whose diplomatic views coincided with\nhis own. Li's diplomatic language, however, was less unconventional. In\nan interview with the Ministers, Gordon's expressions were such that the\ninterpreter shook with terror, upset a cup of tea, and finally refused\nto translate the dreadful words; upon which Gordon snatched up a\ndictionary, and, with his finger on the word 'idiocy', showed it to the\nstartled Mandarins. A few weeks later, Li Hung Chang was in power, and\npeace was assured. Gordon had spent two and a half days in Pekin, and\nwas whirling through China, when a telegram arrived from the home\nauthorities, who viewed his movements with uneasiness, ordering him to\nreturn at once to England. 'It did not produce a twitter in me,' he\nwrote to his sister; 'I died long ago, and it will not make any\ndifference to me; I am prepared to follow the unrolling of the scroll.'\nThe world, perhaps, was not big enough for him; and yet how clearly he\nrecognised that he was 'a poor insect!' 'My heart tells me that, and I\nam glad of it.'\n\nOn his return to England, he telegraphed to the Government of the Cape\nof Good Hope, which had become involved in a war with the Basutos,\noffering his services; but his telegram received no reply. Just then,\nSir Howard Elphinstone was appointed to the command of the Royal\nEngineers in Mauritius. It was a thankless and insignificant post; and,\nrather than accept it, Elphinstone was prepared to retire from the\nArmy--unless some other officer could be induced, in return for L800, to\nact as his substitute. Gordon, who was an old friend, agreed to\nundertake the work upon one condition: that he should receive nothing\nfrom Elphinstone; and accordingly, he spent the next year in that remote\nand unhealthy island, looking after the barrack repairs and testing the\ndrains.\n\nWhile he was thus engaged, the Cape Government, whose difficulties had\nbeen increasing, changed its mind, and early in 1882, begged for\nGordon's help. Once more he was involved in great affairs: a new field\nof action opened before him; and then, in a moment, there was another\nshift of the kaleidoscope, and again he was thrown upon the world.\nWithin a few weeks, after a violent quarrel with the Cape authorities,\nhis mission had come to an end. What should he do next? To what remote\ncorner or what enormous stage, to what self-sacrificing drudgeries or\nwhat resounding exploits, would the hand of God lead him now? He waited,\nin an odd hesitation. He opened the Bible, but neither the prophecies of\nHosea nor the epistles to Timothy gave him any advice. The King of the\nBelgians asked if he would be willing to go to the Congo. He was\nperfectly willing; he would go whenever the King of the Belgians sent\nfor him; his services, however, were not required yet. It was at this\njuncture that he betook himself to Palestine. His studies there were\nembodied in a correspondence with the Rev. Mr. Barnes, filling over\n2,000 pages of manuscript--a correspondence which was only put an end to\nwhen, at last, the summons from the King of the Belgians came. He\nhurried back to England; but it was not to the Congo that he was being\nled by the hand of God.\n\nGordon's last great adventure, like his first, was occasioned by a\nreligious revolt. At the very moment when, apparently forever, he was\nshaking the dust of Egypt from his feet, Mahommed Ahmed was starting\nupon his extraordinary career in the Sudan. The time was propitious for\nrevolutions. The effete Egyptian Empire was hovering upon the verge of\ncollapse. The enormous territories of the Sudan were seething with\ndiscontent. Gordon's administration had, by its very vigour, only helped\nto precipitate the inevitable disaster. His attacks upon the\nslave-trade, his establishment of a government monopoly in ivory, his\nhostility to the Egyptian officials, had been so many shocks, shaking to\nits foundations the whole rickety machine. The result of all his efforts\nhad been, on the one hand, to fill the most powerful classes in the\ncommunity--the dealers in slaves and, ivory--with a hatred of the\ngovernment, and on the other to awaken among the mass of the inhabitants\na new perception of the dishonesty and incompetence of their Egyptian\nmasters. When, after Gordon's removal, the rule of the Pashas once more\nasserted itself over the Sudan, a general combustion became inevitable:\nthe first spark would set off the blaze. Just then it happened that\nMahommed Ahmed, the son of an insignificant priest in Dongola, having\nquarrelled with the Sheikh from whom he was receiving religious\ninstruction, set up as an independent preacher, with his headquarters at\nAbba Island, on the Nile, 150 miles above Khartoum. Like Hong-siu-tsuen,\nhe began as a religious reformer, and ended as a rebel king. It was his\nmission, he declared, to purge the true Faith of its worldliness and\ncorruptions, to lead the followers of the prophet into the paths of\nchastity, simplicity, and holiness; with the puritanical zeal of a\nCalvin, be denounced junketings and merrymakings, songs and dances, lewd\nliving and all the delights of the flesh. He fell into trances, he saw\nvisions, he saw the prophet and Jesus, and the Angel Izrail accompanying\nhim and watching over him forever. He prophesied and performed miracles,\nand his fame spread through the land.\n\nThere is an ancient tradition in the Mohammedan world, telling of a\nmysterious being, the last in succession of the twelve holy Imams, who,\nuntouched by death and withdrawn into the recesses of a mountain, was\ndestined, at the appointted hour, to come forth again among men. His\ntitle was the Mahdi, the guide; some believed that he would be the\nforerunner of the Messiah; others believed that he would be Christ\nhimself. Already various Mahdis had made their appearance; several had\nbeen highly successful, and two, in medieval times, had founded\ndynasties in Egypt. But who could tell whether all these were not\nimpostors? Might not the twelfth Imam be still waiting, in mystical\nconcealment, ready to emerge, at any moment, at the bidding of God?\nThere were signs by which the true Mahdi might be recognised--unmistakable\nsigns, if one could but read them aright. He must be of the family of\nthe prophet; he must possess miraculous powers of no common kind; and\nhis person must be overflowing with a peculiar sanctity. The pious\ndwellers beside those distant waters, where holy men by dint of a\nconstant repetition of one of the ninety-nine names of God, secured the\nprotection of guardian angels, and where groups of devotees, shaking\ntheir heads with a violence which would unseat the reason of less\nathletic worshippers, attained to an extraordinary beatitude, heard with\nawe of the young preacher whose saintliness was almost more than mortal\nand whose miracles brought amazement to the mind. Was he not also of the\nfamily of the prophet? He himself had said so, and who would disbelieve\nthe holy man? When he appeared in person, every doubt was swept away.\n\nThere was a strange splendour in his presence, an overpowering passion\nin the torrent of his speech. Great was the wickedness of the people,\nand great was their punishment! Surely their miseries were a visible\nsign of the wrath of the Lord. They had sinned, and the cruel tax\ngatherers had come among them, and the corrupt governors, and all the\noppressions of the Egyptians. Yet these things, 'Too, should have an\nend. The Lord would raise up his chosen deliverer; the hearts of the\npeople would be purified, and their enemies would be laid low. The\naccursed Egyptian would be driven from the land. Let the faithful take\nheart and make ready. How soon might not the long-predestined hour\nstrike, when the twelfth Imam, the guide, the Mahdi, would reveal\nhimself to the world?' In that hour, the righteous 'Would triumph and\nthe guilty be laid low forever.' Such was the teaching of Mohammed\nAhmed. A band of enthusiastic disciples gathered round him, eagerly\nwaiting for the revelation which would crown their hopes. At last, the\nmoment came. One evening, at Abba Island, taking aside the foremost of\nhis followers, the Master whispered the portentous news. He was the\nMahdi.\n\nThe Egyptian Governor-General at Khartoum, hearing that a religious\nmovement was afoot, grew disquieted, and dispatched an emissary to Abba\nIsland to summon the impostor to his presence. The emissary was\ncourteously received. Mohammed Ahmed, he said, must come at once to\nKhartoum. 'Must!' exclaimed the Mahdi, starting to his feet, with a\nstrange look in his eyes. The look was so strange that the emissary\nthought it advisable to cut short the interview and to return to\nKhartoum empty-handed. Thereupon, the Governor-General sent 200 soldiers\nto seize the audacious rebel by force. With his handful of friends, the\nMahdi fell upon the soldiers and cut them to pieces. The news spread\nlike wild-fire through the country: the Mahdi had arisen, the Egyptians\nwere destroyed. But it was clear to the little band of enthusiasts at\nAbba Island that their position on the river was no longer tenable. The\nMahdi, deciding upon a second Hegira, retreated south-westward, into the\ndepths of Kordofan.\n\nThe retreat was a triumphal progress. The country, groaning under alien\nmisgovernment and vibrating with religious excitement, suddenly found in\nthis rebellious prophet a rallying-point, a hero, a deliverer. And now\nanother element was added to the forces of insurrection. The Baggara\ntribes of Kordofan, cattle-owners and slave-traders, the most warlike\nand vigorous of the inhabitants of the Sudan, threw in their lot with\nthe Mahdi. Their powerful Emirs, still smarting from the blows of\nGordon, saw that the opportunity for revenge had come. A holy war was\nproclaimed against the Egyptian misbelievers. The followers of the\nMahdi, dressed, in token of a new austerity of living, in the 'jibbeh',\nor white smock of coarse cloth, patched with variously shaped and\ncoloured patches, were rapidly organised into a formidable army. Several\nattacks from Khartoum were repulsed; and at last, the Mahdi felt strong\nenough to advance against the enemy. While his lieutenants led\ndetachments into the vast provinces lying to the west and the\nsouth--Darfur and Bahr-el-Ghazal--he himself marched upon El Obeid, the\ncapital of Kordofan. It was in vain that reinforcements were hurried\nfrom Khartoum to the assistance of the garrison: there was some severe\nfighting; the town was completely cut off; and, after a six months'\nsiege, it surrendered. A great quantity of guns and ammunition and\nL100,000 in spices fell into the hands of the Mahdi. He was master of\nKordofan: he was at the head of a great army; he was rich; he was\nworshipped. A dazzling future opened before him. No possibility seemed\ntoo remote, no fortune too magnificent. A vision of universal empire\nhovered before his eyes. Allah, whose servant he was, who had led him\nthus far, would lead him onward still, to the glorious end.\n\nFor some months he remained at El Obeid, consolidating his dominion. In\na series of circular letters, he described his colloquies with the\nAlmighty and laid down the rule of living which his followers were to\npursue. The faithful, under pain of severe punishment, were to return to\nthe ascetic simplicity of ancient times. A criminal code was drawn up,\nmeting out executions, mutilations, and floggings with a barbaric zeal.\nThe blasphemer was to be instantly hanged, the adulterer was to be\nscourged with whips of rhinoceros hide, the thief was to have his right\nhand and his left foot hacked off in the marketplace. No more were\nmarriages to be celebrated with pomp and feasting, no more was the\nyouthful warrior to swagger with flowing hair; henceforth, the believer\nmust banquet on dates and milk, and his head must be kept shaved. Minor\ntransgressions were punished by confiscation of property or by\nimprisonment and chains. But the rhinoceros whip was the favourite\ninstrument of chastisement. Men were flogged for drinking a glass of\nwine, they were flogged for smoking; if they swore, they received eighty\nlashes for every expletive; and after eighty lashes it was a common\nthing to die. Before long, flogging grew to be so everyday an incident\nthat the young men made a game of it, as a test of their endurance of\npain.\n\nWith this Spartan ferocity there was mingled the glamour and the mystery\nof the East. The Mahdi himself, his four Khalifas, and the principal\nEmirs, masters of sudden riches, surrounded themselves with slaves and\nwomen, with trains of horses and asses, with body guards and glittering\narms. There were rumours of debaucheries in high places--of the Mahdi,\nforgetful of his own ordinances, revelling in the recesses of his harem,\nand quaffing date syrup mixed with ginger out of the silver cups looted\nfrom the church of the Christians. But that imposing figure had only to\nshow itself for the tongue of scandal to be stilled. The tall,\nbroad-shouldered, majestic man, with the dark face and black beard and\ngreat eyes--who could doubt that he was the embodiment of a superhuman\npower? Fascination dwelt in every movement, every glance. The eyes,\npainted with antimony, flashed extraordinary fires; the exquisite smile\nrevealed, beneath the vigorous lips, white upper teeth with a V-shaped\nspace between them--the certain sign of fortune. His turban was folded\nwith faultless art, his jibbeh, speckless, was perfumed with\nsandal-wood, musk, and attar of roses. He was at once all courtesy and\nall command. Thousands followed him, thousands prostrated themselves\nbefore him; thousands, when he lifted up his voice in solemn worship,\nknew that the heavens were opened and that they had come near to God.\nThen all at once the onbeia--the elephant's-tusk trumpet--would give out\nits enormous sound. The nahas--the brazen wardrums--would summon, with\ntheir weird rolling, the whole host to arms. The green flag and the red\nflag and the black flag would rise over the multitude. The great army\nwould move forward, coloured, glistening, dark, violent, proud,\nbeautiful. The drunkenness, the madness of religion would blaze on every\nface; and the Mahdi, immovable on his charger, would let the scene grow\nunder his eyes in silence.\n\nEl Obeid fell in January, 1883. Meanwhile, events of the deepest\nimportance had occurred in Egypt. The rise of Arabi had synchronised\nwith that of the Mahdi. Both movements were nationalist; both were\ndirected against alien rulers who had shown themselves unfit to rule.\nWhile the Sudanese were shaking off the yoke of Egypt, the Egyptians\nthemselves grew impatient of their own masters--the Turkish and\nCircassian Pashas who filled with their incompetence all the high\noffices of state. The army led by Ahmed Arabi, a Colonel of fellah\norigin, mutinied, the Khedive gave way, and it seemed as if a new order\nwere about to be established. A new order was indeed upon the point of\nappearing: but it was of a kind undreamt of in Arabi's philosophy. At\nthe critical moment, the English Government intervened. An English fleet\nbombarded Alexandria, an English army landed under Lord Wolseley, and\ndefeated Arabi and his supporters at Tel-el-kebir. The rule of the\nPashas was nominally restored; but henceforth, in effect, the English\nwere masters of Egypt.\n\nNevertheless, the English themselves were slow to recognise this fact:\ntheir Government had intervened unwillingly; the occupation of the\ncountry was a merely temporary measure; their army was to be withdrawn\nas soon as a tolerable administration had been set up. But a tolerable\nadministration, presided over by the Pashas, seemed long in coming, and\nthe English army remained. In the meantime, the Mahdi had entered El\nObeid, and his dominion was rapidly spreading over the greater part of\nthe Sudan.\n\nThen a terrible catastrophe took place. The Pashas, happy once more in\nCairo, pulling the old strings and growing fat over the old flesh-pots,\ndecided to give the world an unmistakable proof of their renewed vigour.\nThey would tolerate the insurrection in the Sudan no longer; they would\ndestroy the Mahdi, reduce his followers to submission, and re-establish\ntheir own beneficent rule over the whole country. To this end they\ncollected together an army of 10,000 men, and placed it under the\ncommand of Colonel Hicks, a retired English officer. He was ordered to\nadvance and suppress the rebellion. In these proceedings the English\nGovernment refused to take any part. Unable, or unwilling, to realise\nthat, so long as there was an English army in Egypt they could not avoid\nthe responsibilities of supreme power, they declared that the domestic\npolicy of the Egyptian administration was no concern of theirs. It was a\nfatal error--an error which they themselves, before many weeks were\nover, were to be forced by the hard logic of events to admit. The\nPashas, left to their own devices, mismanaged the Hicks expedition to\ntheir hearts' content. The miserable troops, swept together from the\nrelics of Arabi's disbanded army, were dispatched to Khartoum in chains.\nAfter a month's drilling, they were pronounced to be fit to attack the\nfanatics of the Sudan. Colonel Hicks was a brave man; urged on by the\nauthorities in Cairo, he shut his eyes to the danger ahead of him, and\nmarched out from Khartoum in the direction of El Obeid at the beginning\nof September, 1883. Abandoning his communications, he was soon deep in\nthe desolate wastes of Kordofan. As he advanced, his difficulties\nincreased; the guides were treacherous, the troops grew exhausted, the\nsupply of water gave out. He pressed on, and at last, on November 5th,\nnot far from El Obeid, the harassed, fainting, almost desperate army\nplunged into a vast forest of gumtrees and mimosa scrub. There was a\nsudden, appalling yell; the Mahdi, with 40,000 of his finest men, sprang\nfrom their ambush. The Egyptians were surrounded, and immediately\noverpowered. It was not a defeat, but an annihilation. Hicks and his\nEuropean staff were slaughtered; the whole army was slaughtered; 300\nwounded wretches crept away into the forest.\n\nThe consequences of this event were felt in every part of the Sudan. To\nthe westward, in Darfur, the Governor, Slatin Pasha, after a prolonged\nand valiant resistance, was forced to surrender, and the whole province\nfell into the hands of the rebels. Southwards, in the Bahr-el-Ghazal,\nLupton Bey was shut up in a remote stronghold, while the country was\noverrun. The Mahdi's triumphs were beginning to penetrate even into the\ntropical regions of Equatoria; the tribes were rising, and Emir Pasha\nwas preparing to retreat towards the Great Lakes. On the East, Osman\nDigna pushed the insurrection right up to the shores of the Red Sea and\nlaid siege to Suakin. Before the year was over, with the exception of a\nfew isolated and surrounded garrisons, the Mahdi was absolute lord of a\nterritory equal to the combined area of Spain, France, and Germany; and\nhis victorious armies were rapidly closing round Khartoum.\n\nWhen the news of the Hicks disaster reached Cairo, the Pashas calmly\nannounced that they would collect another army of 10,000 men, and again\nattack the Mahdi; but the English Government understood at last the\ngravity of the case. They saw that a crisis was upon them, and that they\ncould no longer escape the implications of their position in Egypt. What\nwere they to do? Were they to allow the Egyptians to become more and\nmore deeply involved in a ruinous, perhaps ultimately a fatal, war with\nthe Mahdi? And, if not, what steps were they to take?\n\nA small minority of the party then in power in England--the Liberal\nParty--were anxious to withdraw from Egypt altogether and at once. On\nthe other hand, another and a more influential minority, with\nrepresentatives in the Cabinet, were in favour of a more active\nintervention in Egyptian affairs--of the deliberate use of the power of\nEngland to give to Egypt internal stability and external security; they\nwere ready, if necessary, to take the field against the Mahdi with\nEnglish troops. But the great bulk of the party, and the Cabinet, with\nMr. Gladstone at their head, preferred a middle course. Realising the\nimpracticality of an immediate withdrawal, they were nevertheless\ndetermined to remain in Egypt not a moment longer than was necessary,\nand, in the meantime, to interfere as little as possible in Egyptian\naffairs.\n\nFrom a campaign in the Sudan conducted by an English army they were\naltogether averse. If, therefore, the English army was not to be used,\nand the Egyptian army was not fit to be used against the Mahdi, it\nfollowed that any attempt to reconquer the Sudan must be abandoned; the\nremaining Egyptian troops must be withdrawn, and in future military\noperations must be limited to those of a strictly defensive kind. Such\nwas the decision of the English Government. Their determination was\nstrengthened by two considerations: in the first place, they saw that\nthe Mahdi's rebellion was largely a nationalist movement, directed\nagainst an alien power, and, in the second place, the policy of\nwithdrawal from the Sudan was the policy of their own representative in\nEgypt, Sir Evelyn Baring, who had lately been appointed Consul-General\nat Cairo. There was only one serious obstacle in the way--the attitude\nof the Pashas at the head of the Egyptian Government. The infatuated old\nmen were convinced that they would have better luck next time, that\nanother army and another Hicks would certainly destroy the Mahdi, and\nthat, even if the Mahdi were again victorious, yet another army and yet\nanother Hicks would no doubt be forthcoming, and that THEY would do the\ntrick, or, failing that ... but they refused to consider eventualities\nany further. In the face of such opposition, the English Government,\nunwilling as they were to interfere, saw that there was no choice open\nto them but to exercise pressure. They therefore instructed Sir Evelyn\nBaring, in the event of the Egyptian Government refusing to withdraw\nfrom the Sudan, to insist upon the Khedive's appointing other Ministers\nwho would be willing to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, not only the Government, but the public in England were\nbeginning to realise the alarming nature of the Egyptian situation. It\nwas some time before the details of the Hicks expedition were fully\nknown, but when they were, and when the appalling character of the\ndisaster was understood, a thrill of horror ran through the country. The\nnewspapers became full of articles on the Sudan, of personal\ndescriptions of the Mahdi, of agitated letters from colonels and\nclergymen demanding vengeance, and of serious discussions of future\npolicy in Egypt. Then, at the beginning of the new year, alarming\nmessages began to arrive from Khartoum. Colonel Coetlogon, who was in\ncommand of the Egyptian troops, reported a menacing concentration of the\nenemy. Day by day, hour by hour, affairs grew worse. The Egyptians were\nobviously outnumbered: they could not maintain themselves in the field;\nKhartoum was in danger; at any moment, its investment might be complete.\nAnd, with Khartoum once cut off from communication with Egypt, what\nmight not happen? Colonel Coetlogon began to calculate how long the city\nwould hold out. Perhaps it could not resist the Mahdi for a month,\nperhaps for more than a month; but he began to talk of the necessity of\na speedy retreat. It was clear that a climax was approaching, and that\nmeasures must be taken to forestall it at once. Accordingly, Sir Evelyn\nBaring, on receipt of final orders from England, presented an ultimatum\nto the Egyptian Government: the Ministry must either sanction the\nevacuation of the Sudan, or it must resign. The Ministry was obstinate,\nand, on January 7th, 1884, it resigned, to be replaced by a more pliable\nbody of Pashas. On the same day, General Gordon arrived at Southampton.\nHe was over fifty, and he was still, by the world's measurements, an\nunimportant man. In spite of his achievements, in spite of a certain\ncelebrity--for 'Chinese Gordon' was still occasionally spoken of--he was\nunrecognised and almost unemployed.\n\nHe had spent a lifetime in the dubious services of foreign governments,\npunctuated by futile drudgeries at home; and now, after a long idleness,\nhe had been sent for--to do what?--to look after the Congo for the King\nof the Belgians. At his age, even if he survived the work and the\nclimate, he could hardly look forward to any subsequent appointment; he\nwould return from the Congo, old and worn out, to a red-brick villa and\nextinction. Such were General Gordon's prospects on January 7th, 1884.\nBy January 18th, his name was on every tongue, he was the favourite of\nthe nation, he had been declared to be the one living man capable of\ncoping with the perils of the hour; he had been chosen, with unanimous\napproval, to perform a great task; and he had left England on a mission\nwhich was to bring him not only a boundless popularity, but an immortal\nfame. The circumstances which led to a change so sudden and so\nremarkable are less easily explained than might have been wished. An\nambiguity hangs over them--an ambiguity which the discretion of eminent\npersons has certainly not diminished. But some of the facts are clear\nenough.\n\nThe decision to withdraw from the Sudan had no sooner been taken than it\nhad become evident that the operation would be a difficult and hazardous\none, and that it would be necessary to send to Khartoum an emissary\narmed with special powers and possessed of special ability, to carry it\nout. Towards the end of November, somebody at the War Office--it is not\nclear who--had suggested that this emissary should be General Gordon.\nLord Granville, the Foreign Secretary, had thereupon telegraphed to Sir\nEvelyn Baring asking whether, in his opinion, the presence of General\nGordon would be useful in Egypt; Sir Evelyn Baring had replied that the\nEgyptian Government was averse to this proposal, and the matter had\ndropped.\n\nThere was no further reference to Gordon in the official dispatches\nuntil after his return to England. Nor, before that date, was any\nallusion made to him as a possible unraveller of the Sudan difficulty,\nin the Press. In all the discussions which followed the news of the\nHicks disaster, his name is only to be found in occasional and\nincidental references to his work \"In the Sudan\". The \"Pall Mall\nGazette\", which, more than any other newspaper, interested itself in\nEgyptian affairs, alluded to Gordon once or twice as a geographical\nexpert; but, in an enumeration of the leading authorities on the Sudan,\nleft him out of account altogether. Yet it was from the \"Pall Mall\nGazette\" that the impulsion which projected him into a blaze of\npublicity finally came. Mr. Stead, its enterprising editor, went down to\nSouthampton the day after Gordon's arrival there, and obtained an\ninterview. Now when he was in the mood--after a little b. and s.,\nespecially--no one was more capable than Gordon, with his facile speech\nand his free-and-easy manners, of furnishing good copy for a journalist;\nand Mr. Stead made the most of his opportunity. The interview, copious\nand pointed, was published next day in the most prominent part of the\npaper, together with a leading article, demanding that the General\nshould be immediately dispatched to Khartoum with the widest powers. The\nrest of the Press, both in London and in the provinces, at once took up\nthe cry: General Gordon was a capable and energetic officer, he was a\nnoble and God-fearing man, he was a national asset, he was a statesman\nin the highest sense of the word; the occasion was pressing and\nperilous; General Gordon had been for years Governor-General of the\nSudan; General Gordon alone had the knowledge, the courage, the virtue,\nwhich would save the situation; General Gordon must go to Khartoum. So,\nfor a week, the papers sang in chorus. But already those in high places\nhad taken a step. Mr. Stead's interview appeared on the afternoon of\nJanuary 9th, and on the morning of January 10th Lord Granville\ntelegraphed to Sir Evelyn Baring, proposing, for a second time, that\nGordon's services should be utilised in Egypt. But Sir Evelyn Baring,\nfor the second time, rejected the proposal.\n\nWhile these messages were flashing to and fro, Gordon himself was paying\na visit to the Rev. Mr. Barnes at the Vicarage of Heavitree, near\nExeter. The conversation ran chiefly on Biblical and spiritual\nmatters--on the light thrown by the Old Testament upon the geography of\nPalestine, and on the relations between man and his Maker; but, there\nwere moments when topics of a more worldly interest arose. It happened\nthat Sir Samuel Baker, Gordon's predecessor in Equatoria, lived in the\nneighbourhood. A meeting was arranged, and the two ex-Governors, with\nMr. Barnes in attendance, went for a drive together. In the carriage,\nSir Samuel Baker, taking up the tale of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", dilated\nupon the necessity of his friend's returning to the Sudan as\nGovernor-General. Gordon was silent; but Mr. Barnes noticed that his\nblue eyes flashed, while an eager expression passed over his face. Late\nthat night, after the Vicar had retired to bed, he was surprised by the\ndoor suddenly opening, and by the appearance of his guest swiftly\ntripping into the room. 'You saw me today?' the low voice abruptly\nquestioned. 'You mean in the carriage?' replied the startled Mr. Barnes.\n'Yes,' came the reply; 'you saw ME--that was MYSELF--the self I want to\nget rid of.' There was a sliding movement, the door swung to, and the\nVicar found himself alone again.\n\nIt was clear that a disturbing influence had found its way into Gordon's\nmind. His thoughts, wandering through Africa, flitted to the Sudan; they\ndid not linger at the Congo. During the same visit, he took the\nopportunity of calling upon Dr. Temple, the Bishop of Exeter, and asking\nhim, merely as a hypothetical question, whether, in his opinion,\nSudanese converts to Christianity might be permitted to keep three\nwives. His Lordship answered that this would be uncanonical.\n\nA few days later, it appeared that the conversation in the carriage at\nHeavitree had borne fruit. Gordon wrote a letter to Sir Samuel Baker,\nfurther elaborating the opinions on the Sudan which he had already\nexpressed in his interview with Mr. Stead; the letter was clearly\nintended for publication, and published it was in \"The Times\" of January\n14th. On the same day, Gordon's name began once more to buzz along the\nwires in secret questions and answers to and from the highest quarters.\n\n'Might it not be advisable,' telegraphed Lord Granville to Mr.\nGladstone, to put a little pressure on Baring, to induce him to accept\nthe assistance of General Gordon?' Mr. Gladstone replied, also by a\ntelegram, in the affirmative; and on the 15th, Lord Wolseley telegraphed\nto Gordon begging him to come to London immediately. Lord Wolseley, who\nwas one of Gordon's oldest friends, was at that time Adjutant-General of\nthe Forces; there was a long interview; and, though the details of the\nconversation have never transpired, it is known that, in the course of\nit, Lord Wolseley asked Gordon if he would be willing to go to the\nSudan, to which Gordon replied that there was only one objection--his\nprior engagement to the King of the Belgians. Before nightfall, Lord\nGranville, by private telegram, had 'put a little pressure on Baring'.\n'He had,' he said, 'heard indirectly that Gordon was ready to go at once\nto the Sudan on the following rather vague terms: His mission to be to\nreport to Her Majesty's Government on the military situation, and to\nreturn without any further engagement. He would be under you for\ninstructions and will send letters through you under flying seal ... He\nmight be of use,' Lord Granville added, in informing you and us of the\nsituation. It would be popular at home, but there may be countervailing\nobjections. Tell me,' such was Lord Granville's concluding injunction,\n'your real opinion.' It was the third time of asking, and Sir Evelyn\nBaring resisted no longer.\n\n'Gordon,' he telegraphed on the 16th, 'would be the best man if he will\npledge himself to carry out the policy of withdrawing from the Sudan as\nquickly as is possible, consistently with saving life. He must also\nunderstand that he must take his instructions from the British\nrepresentative in Egypt ... I would rather have him than anyone else,\nprovided there is a perfectly clear understanding with him as to what\nhis position is to be and what line of policy he is to carry out.\nOtherwise, not ... Whoever goes should be distinctly warned that he will\nundertake a service of great difficulty and danger.'\n\nIn the meantime, Gordon, with the Sudan upon his lips, with the Sudan in\nhis imagination, had hurried to Brussels, to obtain from the King of the\nBelgians a reluctant consent to the postponement of his Congo mission.\nOn the 17th he was recalled to London by a telegram from Lord Wolseley.\nOn the 18th the final decision was made. 'At noon,' Gordon told the Rev.\nMr. Barnes, Wolseley came to me and took me to the Ministers. He went in\nand talked to the Ministers, and came back and said: \"Her Majesty's\nGovernment wants you to undertake this. Government is determined to\nevacuate the Sudan, for they will not guarantee future government. Will\nyou go and do it?\" I said: \"Yes.\" He said: \"Go in.\" I went in and saw\nthem. They said: \"Did Wolseley tell you your orders?\" I said: \"Yes.\" I\nsaid: \"You will not guarantee future government of the Sudan, and you\nwish me to go up and evacuate now.\" They said: \"Yes\", and it was over.'\n\nSuch was the sequence of events which ended in General Gordon's last\nappointment. The precise motives of those responsible for these\ntransactions are less easy to discern. It is difficult to understand\nwhat the reasons could have been which induced the Government, not only\nto override the hesitations of Sir Evelyn Baring, but to overlook the\ngrave and obvious dangers involved in sending such a man as Gordon to\nthe Sudan. The whole history of his life, the whole bent of his\ncharacter, seemed to disqualify him for the task for which he had been\nchosen. He was before all things a fighter, an enthusiast, a bold\nadventurer; and he was now to be entrusted with the conduct of an\ninglorious retreat. He was alien to the subtleties of civilised\nstatesmanship, he was unamenable to official control, he was incapable\nof the skilful management of delicate situations; and he was now to be\nplaced in a position of great complexity, requiring at once a cool\njudgment, a clear perception of fact, and a fixed determination to carry\nout a line of policy laid down from above. He had, it is true, been\nGovernor-General of the Sudan; but he was now to return to the scene of\nhis greatness as the emissary of a defeated and humbled power; he was to\nbe a fugitive where he had once been a ruler; the very success of his\nmission was to consist in establishing the triumph of those forces which\nhe had spent years in trampling underfoot. All this should have been\nclear to those in authority, after a very little reflection. It was\nclear enough to Sir Evelyn Baring, though, with characteristic\nreticence, he had abstained from giving expression to his thoughts. But,\neven if a general acquaintance with Gordon's life and character were not\nsufficient to lead to these conclusions, he himself had taken care to\nput their validity beyond reasonable doubt. Both in his interview with\nMr. Stead and in his letter to Sir Samuel Baker, he had indicated\nunmistakably his own attitude towards the Sudan situation. The policy\nwhich he advocated, the state of feeling in which he showed himself to\nbe, was diametrically opposed to the declared intentions of the\nGovernment. He was by no means in favour of withdrawing from the Sudan;\nhe was in favour, as might have been supposed, of vigorous military\naction. It might be necessary to abandon, for the time being, the more\nremote garrisons in Darfur and Equatoria; but Khartoum must be held at\nall costs. To allow the Mahdi to enter Khartoum would not merely mean\nthe return of the whole of the Sudan to barbarism; it would be a menace\nto the safety of Egypt herself. To attempt to protect Egypt against the\nMahdi by fortifying her southern frontier was preposterous. 'You might\nas well fortify against a fever.' Arabia, Syria, the whole Mohammedan\nworld, would be shaken by the Mahdi's advance. 'In self-defence,' Gordon\ndeclared to Mr. Stead, the policy of evacuation cannot possibly be\njustified.' The true policy was obvious. A strong man--Sir Samuel Baker,\nperhaps--must be sent to Khartoum, with a large contingent of Indian and\nTurkish troops and with two millions of money. He would very soon\noverpower the Mahdi, whose forces would 'fall to pieces of themselves'.\nFor in Gordon's opinion it was 'an entire mistake to regard the Mahdi as\nin any sense a religious leader'; he would collapse as soon as he was\nface to face with an English general. Then the distant regions of Darfur\nand Equatoria could once more be occupied; their original Sultans could\nbe reinstated; the whole country would be placed under civilised rule;\nand the slave-trade would be finally abolished. These were the views\nwhich Gordon publicly expressed on January 9th and on January 14th; and\nit certainly seems strange that on January 10th and on January 14th,\nLord Granville should have proposed, without a word of consultation with\nGordon himself, to send him on a mission which involved, not the\nreconquest, but the abandonment of the Sudan; Gordon, indeed, when he\nwas actually approached by Lord Wolseley, had apparently agreed to\nbecome the agent of a policy which was exactly the reverse of his own.\nNo doubt, too, it is possible for a subordinate to suppress his private\nconvictions and to carry out loyally, in spite of them, the orders of\nhis superiors. But how rare are the qualities of self-control and wisdom\nwhich such a subordinate must possess! And how little reason there was\nto think that General Gordon possessed them!\n\nIn fact, the conduct of the Government wears so singular an appearance\nthat it has seemed necessary to account for it by some ulterior\nexplanation. It has often been asserted that the true cause of Gordon's\nappointment was the clamour in the Press. It is said--among others, by\nSir Evelyn Baring himself, who has given something like an official\nsanction to this view of the case--that the Government could not resist\nthe pressure of the newspapers and the feeling in the country which it\nindicated; that Ministers, carried off their feet by a wave of 'Gordon\ncultus', were obliged to give way to the inevitable. But this suggestion\nis hardly supported by an examination of the facts. Already, early in\nDecember, and many weeks before Gordon's name had begun to figure in the\nnewspapers, Lord Granville had made his first effort to induce Sir\nEvelyn Baring to accept Gordon's services. The first newspaper demand\nfor a Gordon mission appeared in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" on the\nafternoon of January 9th; and the very next morning, Lord Granville was\nmaking his second telegraphic attack upon Sir Evelyn Baring. The feeling\nin the Press did not become general until the 11th, and on the 14th Lord\nGranville, in his telegram to Mr. Gladstone, for the third time proposed\nthe appointment of Gordon. Clearly, on the part of Lord Granville at any\nrate, there was no extreme desire to resist the wishes of the Press. Nor\nwas the Government as a whole by any means incapable of ignoring public\nopinion; a few months were to show that, plainly enough. It is difficult\nto avoid the conclusion that if Ministers had been opposed to the\nappointment of Gordon, he would never have been appointed. As it was,\nthe newspapers were in fact forestalled, rather than followed, by the\nGovernment.\n\nHow, then, are we to explain the Government's action? Are we to suppose\nthat its members, like the members of the public at large, were\nthemselves carried away by a sudden enthusiasm, a sudden conviction that\nthey had found their saviour; that General Gordon was the man--they did\nnot quite know why, but that was of no consequence--the one man to get\nthem out of the whole Sudan difficulty--they did not quite know how, but\nthat was of no consequence either if only he were sent to Khartoum?\nDoubtless even Cabinet Ministers are liable to such impulses; doubtless\nit is possible that the Cabinet of that day allowed itself to drift, out\nof mere lack of consideration, and judgment, and foresight, along the\nrapid stream of popular feeling towards the inevitable cataract. That\nmay be so; yet there are indications that a more definite influence was\nat work. There was a section of the Government which had never become\nquite reconciled to the policy of withdrawing from the Sudan. To this\nsection--we may call it the imperialist section--which was led, inside\nthe Cabinet, by Lord Hartington, and outside by Lord Wolseley, the\npolicy which really commended itself was the very policy which had been\noutlined by General Gordon in his interview with Mr. Stead and his\nletter to Sir Samuel Baker. They saw that it might be necessary to\nabandon some of the outlying parts of the Sudan to the Mahdi; but the\nprospect of leaving the whole province in his hands was highly\ndistasteful to them; above all, they dreaded the loss of Khartoum. Now,\nsupposing that General Gordon, in response to a popular agitation in the\nPress, were sent to Khartoum, what would follow? Was it not at least\npossible that, once there, with his views and his character, he would,\nfor some reason or other, refrain from carrying out a policy of pacific\nretreat? Was it not possible that in that case he might so involve the\nEnglish Government that it would find itself obliged, almost\nimperceptibly perhaps, to substitute for its policy of withdrawal a\npolicy of advance? Was it not possible that General Gordon might get\ninto difficulties, that he might be surrounded and cut off from Egypt'?\nIf that were to happen, how could the English Government avoid the\nnecessity of sending an expedition to rescue him? And, if an English\nexpedition went to the Sudan, was it conceivable that it would leave the\nMahdi as it found him? In short, would not the dispatch of General\nGordon to Khartoum involve, almost inevitably, the conquest of the Sudan\nby British troops, followed by a British occupation? And, behind all\nthese questions, a still larger question loomed. The position of the\nEnglish in Egypt itself was still ambiguous; the future was obscure; how\nlong, in reality, would an English army remain in Egypt? Was not one\nthing, at least, obvious--that if the English were to conquer and occupy\nthe Sudan, their evacuation of Egypt would become impossible?\n\nWith our present information, it would be rash to affirm that all, or\nany, of these considerations were present to the minds of the\nimperialist section of the Government. Yet it is difficult to believe\nthat a man such as Lord Wolseley, for instance, with his knowledge of\naffairs and his knowledge of Gordon, could have altogether overlooked\nthem. Lord Hartington, indeed, may well have failed to realise at once\nthe implications of General Gordon's appointment--for it took Lord\nHartington some time to realise the implications of anything; but Lord\nHartington was very far from being a fool; and we may well suppose that\nhe instinctively, perhaps subconsciously, apprehended the elements of a\nsituation which he never formulated to himself. However that may be,\ncertain circumstances are significant. It is significant that the\ngo-between who acted as the Government's agent in its negotiations with\nGordon was an imperialist--Lord Wolseley. It is significant that the\n'Ministers' whom Gordon finally interviewed, and who actually determined\nhis appointment were by no means the whole of the Cabinet, but a small\nsection of it, presided over by Lord Hartington. It is significant, too,\nthat Gordon's mission was represented both to Sir Evelyn Baring, who was\nopposed to his appointment, and to Mr. Gladstone, who was opposed to an\nactive policy in the Sudan, as a mission merely 'to report'; while, no\nsooner was the mission actually decided upon, than it began to assume a\nvery different complexion. In his final interview with the 'Ministers',\nGordon we know (though he said nothing about it to the Rev. Mr Barnes)\nthrew out the suggestion that it might be as well to make him the\nGovernor-General of the Sudan. The suggestion, for the moment, was not\ntaken up; but it is obvious that a man does not propose to become a\nGovernor-General in order to make a report.\n\nWe are in the region of speculations; one other presents itself. Was the\nmovement in the Press during that second week of January a genuine\nmovement, expressing a spontaneous wave of popular feeling? Or was it a\ncause of that feeling, rather than an effect? The engineering of a\nnewspaper agitation may not have been an impossibility--even so long ago\nas 1884. One would like to know more than one is ever likely to know of\nthe relations of the imperialist section of the Government with Mr.\nStead.\n\nBut it is time to return to the solidity of fact. Within a few hours of\nhis interview with the Ministers, Gordon had left England forever. At\neight o'clock in the evening, there was a little gathering of elderly\ngentlemen at Victoria Station. Gordon, accompanied by Colonel Stewart,\nwho was to act as his second-in-command, tripped on to the platform.\nLord Granville bought the necessary tickets; the Duke of Cambridge\nopened the railway-carriage door. The General jumped into the train; and\nthen Lord Wolseley appeared, carrying a leather bag, in which was L200\nin gold, collected from friends at the last moment for the contingencies\nof the journey. The bag was handed through the window. The train\nstarted. As it did so, Gordon leaned out and addressed a last whispered\nquestion to Lord Wolseley. Yes, it had been done. Lord Wolseley had seen\nto it himself; next morning, every member of the Cabinet would receive a\ncopy of Dr. Samuel Clarke's Scripture Promises. That was all. The train\nrolled out of the station.\n\nBefore the travellers reached Cairo, steps had been taken which finally\nput an end to the theory--if it had ever been seriously held--that the\npurpose of the mission was simply the making of a report. On the very\nday of Gordon's departure, Lord Granville telegraphed to Sir Evelyn\nBaring as follows: 'Gordon suggests that it may be announced in Egypt\nthat he is on his way to Khartoum to arrange for the future settlement\nof the Sudan for the best advantage of the people.' Nothing was said of\nreporting. A few days later, Gordon himself telegraphed to Lord\nGranville suggesting that he should be made Governor-General of the\nSudan, in order to 'accomplish the evacuation', and to 'restore to the\nvarious Sultans of the Sudan their independence'. Lord Granville at once\nauthorised Sir Evelyn Baring to issue, if he thought fit, a proclamation\nto this effect in the name of the Khedive. Thus the mission 'to report'\nhad already swollen into a Governor-Generalship, with the object, not\nmerely of effecting the evacuation of the Sudan, but also of setting up\n'various Sultans' to take the place of the Egyptian Government.\n\nIn Cairo, in spite of the hostilities of the past, Gordon was received\nwith every politeness. He was at once proclaimed Governor-General of the\nSudan, with the widest powers. He was on the point of starting off again\non his journey southwards, when a singular and important incident\noccurred. Zobeir, the rebel chieftain of Darfur, against whose forces\nGordon had struggled for years, and whose son, Suleiman, had been\ncaptured and executed by Gessi, Gordon's lieutenant, was still detained\nat Cairo. It so fell out that he went to pay a visit to one of the\nMinisters at the same time as the new Governor-General. The two men met\nface to face, and, as he looked into the savage countenance of his old\nenemy, an extraordinary shock of inspiration ran through Gordon's brain.\nHe was seized, as he explained in a State paper, which he drew up\nimmediately after the meeting, with a 'mystic feeling' that he could\ntrust Zobeir. It was true that Zobeir was 'the greatest slave-hunter who\never existed'; it was true that he had a personal hatred of Gordon,\nowing to the execution of Suleiman--'and one cannot wonder at it, if one\nis a father'; it was true that, only a few days previously, on his way\nto Egypt, Gordon himself had been so convinced of the dangerous\ncharacter of Zobeir that he had recommended by telegram his removal to\nCyprus. But such considerations were utterly obliterated by that one\nmoment of electric impact of personal vision; henceforward, there was a\nrooted conviction in Gordon's mind that Zobeir was to be trusted, that\nZobeir must join him at Khartoum, that Zobeir's presence would paralyse\nthe Mahdi, that Zobeir must succeed him in the government of the country\nafter the evacuation. Did not Sir Evelyn Baring, too, have the mystic\nfeeling? Sir Evelyn Baring confessed that he had not. He distrusted\nmystic feelings. Zobeir, no doubt, might possibly be useful; but, before\ndeciding upon so important a matter, it was necessary to reflect and to\nconsult.\n\nIn the meantime, failing Zobeir, something might perhaps be done with\nthe Emir Abdul Shakur, the heir of the Darfur Sultans. The Emir, who had\nbeen living in domestic retirement in Cairo, was with some difficulty\ndiscovered, given L2,000, an embroidered uniform, together with the\nlargest decoration that could be found, and informed that he was to\nstart at once with General Gordon for the Sudan, where it would be his\nduty to occupy the province of Darfur, after driving out the forces of\nthe Mahdi. The poor man begged for a little delay; but no delay could be\ngranted. He hurried to the railway station in his frockcoat and fez, and\nrather the worse for liquor. Several extra carriages for his\ntwenty-three wives and a large quantity of luggage had then to be\nhitched on to the Governor-General's train; and at the last moment some\ncommotion was caused by the unaccountable disappearance of his\nembroidered uniform. It was found, but his troubles were not over. On\nthe steamer, General Gordon was very rude to him, and he drowned his\nchagrin in hot rum and water. At Assuan he disembarked, declaring that\nhe would go no farther. Eventually, however, he got as far as Dongola,\nwhence, after a stay of a few months, he returned with his family to\nCairo.\n\nIn spite of this little contretemps, Gordon was in the highest spirits.\nAt last his capacities had been recognised by his countrymen; at last he\nhad been entrusted with a task great enough to satisfy even his desires.\nHe was already famous; he would soon be glorious. Looking out once more\nover the familiar desert, he felt the searchings of his conscience\nstilled by the manifest certainty that it was for this that Providence\nhad been reserving him through all these years of labour and of sorrow\nfor this! What was the Mahdi to stand up against him! A thousand\nschemes, a thousand possibilities sprang to life in his pullulating\nbrain. A new intoxication carried him away. 'Il faut etre toujours ivre.\nTout est la: c'est l'unique question.' Little though he knew it, Gordon\nwas a disciple of Baudelaire. 'Pour ne pas sentir l'horrible fardeau du\nTemps qui brise vos epaules et vous penche vers la terre, il faut vous\nenivrer sans treve.' Yes--but how feeble were those gross resources of\nthe miserable Abdul-Shakur! Rum? Brandy? Oh, he knew all about them;\nthey were nothing. He tossed off a glass. They were nothing at all. The\ntrue drunkenness lay elsewhere. He seized a paper and pencil, and dashed\ndown a telegram to Sir Evelyn Baring. Another thought struck him, and\nanother telegram followed. And another, and yet another. He had made up\nhis mind; he would visit the Mahdi in person, and alone. He might do\nthat; or he might retire to the Equator. He would decidedly retire to\nthe Equator, and hand over the Bahr-el-Ghazal province to the King of\nthe Belgians. A whole flock of telegrams flew to Cairo from every\nstopping-place. Sir Evelyn Baring was patient and discrete; he could be\ntrusted with such confidences; but unfortunately Gordon's strange\nexhilaration found other outlets. At Berber, in the course of a speech\nto the assembled chiefs, he revealed the intention of the Egyptian\nGovernment to withdraw from the Sudan. The news was everywhere in a\nmoment, and the results were disastrous. The tribesmen, whom fear and\ninterest had still kept loyal, perceived that they need look no more for\nhelp or punishment from Egypt, and began to turn their eyes towards the\nrising sun.\n\nNevertheless, for the moment, the prospect wore a favourable appearance.\nThe Governor-General was welcomed at every stage of his journey, and on\nFebruary 18th he made a triumphal entry into Khartoum. The feeble\ngarrison, the panic-stricken inhabitants, hailed him as a deliverer.\nSurely they need fear no more, now that the great English Pasha had come\namong them. His first acts seemed to show that a new and happy era had\nbegun. Taxes were remitted, the bonds of the usurers were destroyed, the\nvictims of Egyptian injustice were set free from the prisons; the\nimmemorial instruments of torture--the stocks and the whips and the\nbranding-irons were broken to pieces in the public square. A bolder\nmeasure had been already taken. A proclamation had been issued\nsanctioning slavery in the Sudan. Gordon, arguing that he was powerless\nto do away with the odious institution, which, as soon as the withdrawal\nwas carried out, would inevitably become universal, had decided to reap\nwhat benefit he could from the public abandonment of an unpopular\npolicy. At Khartoum the announcement was received with enthusiasm, but\nit caused considerable perturbation in England. The Christian hero, who\nhad spent so many years of his life in suppressing slavery, was now\nsuddenly found to be using his high powers to set it up again. The\nAnti-Slavery Society made a menacing movement, but the Government showed\na bold front, and the popular belief in Gordon's infallibility carried\nthe day.\n\nHe himself was still radiant. Nor, amid the jubilation and the devotion\nwhich surrounded him, did he forget higher things. In all this turmoil,\nhe told his sister, he was 'supported'. He gave injunctions that his\nEgyptian troops should have regular morning and evening prayers; 'they\nworship one God,' he said, 'Jehovah.' And he ordered an Arabic text,\n'God rules the hearts of all men', to be put up over the chair of state\nin his audience chamber. As the days went by, he began to feel at home\nagain in the huge palace which he knew so well. The glare and the heat\nof that southern atmosphere, the movement of the crowded city, the\ndark-faced populace, the soldiers and the suppliants, the reawakened\nconsciousness of power, the glamour and the mystery of the whole strange\nscene--these things seized upon him, engulfed him, and worked a new\ntransformation on his intoxicated heart. England, with its complications\nand its policies, became an empty vision to him; Sir Evelyn Baring, with\nhis cautions and sagacities, hardly more than a tiresome name. He was\nGordon Pasha, he was the Governor-General, he was the ruler of the\nSudan. He was among his people--his own people, and it was to them only\nthat he was responsible--to them, and to God. Was he to let them fall\nwithout a blow into the clutches of a sanguinary impostor? Never! He was\nthere to prevent that. The distant governments might mutter something\nabout 'evacuation'; his thoughts were elsewhere. He poured them into his\ntelegrams, and Sir Evelyn Baring sat aghast. The man who had left London\na month before, with instructions to 'report upon the best means of\neffecting the evacuation of the Sudan', was now openly talking of\n'smashing up the Mahdi' with the aid of British and Indian troops. Sir\nEvelyn Baring counted upon his fingers the various stages of this\nextraordinary development in General Gordon's opinions. But he might\nhave saved himself the trouble, for, in fact, it was less a development\nthan a reversion. Under the stress of the excitements and the realities\nof his situation at Khartoum, the policy which Gordon was now proposing\nto carry out had come to tally, in every particular, with the policy\nwhich he had originally advocated with such vigorous conviction in the\npages of the Pall Mall Gazette.\n\nNor was the adoption of that policy by the English Government by any\nmeans out of the question. For, in the meantime, events had been taking\nplace in the Eastern Sudan, in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea port of\nSuakin, which were to have a decisive effect upon the prospects of\nKhartoum. General Baker, the brother of Sir Samuel Baker, attempting to\nrelieve the beleaguered garrisons of Sinkat and Tokar, had rashly\nattacked the forces of Osman Digna, had been defeated, and obliged to\nretire. Sinkat and Tokar had then fallen into the hands of the Mahdi's\ngeneral. There was a great outcry in England, and a wave of warlike\nfeeling passed over the country. Lord Wolseley at once drew up a\nmemorandum advocating the annexation of the Sudan. In the House of\nCommons even Liberals began to demand vengeance and military action,\nwhereupon the Government dispatched Sir Gerald Graham with a\nconsiderable British force to Suakin. Sir Gerald Graham advanced, and in\nthe battles of El Teb and Tamai inflicted two bloody defeats upon the\nMahdi's forces. It almost seemed as if the Government was now committed\nto a policy of interference and conquest; as if the imperialist section\nof the Cabinet were at last to have their way. The dispatch of Sir\nGerald Graham coincided with Gordon's sudden demand for British and\nIndian troops with which to 'smash up the Mahdi'. The business, he\nassured Sir Evelyn Baring, in a stream of telegrams, could very easily\nbe done. It made him sick, he said, to see himself held in check and the\npeople of the Sudan tyrannised over by 'a feeble lot of stinking\nDervishes'. Let Zobeir at once be sent down to him, and all would be\nwell.\n\nThe original Sultans of the country had unfortunately proved\ndisappointing. Their place should be taken by Zobeir. After the Mahdi\nhad been smashed up, Zobeir should rule the Sudan as a subsidised vassal\nof England, on a similar footing to that of the Amir of Afghanistan. The\nplan was perhaps feasible; but it was clearly incompatible with the\npolicy of evacuation, as it had been hitherto laid down by the English\nGovernment. Should they reverse that policy? Should they appoint Zobeir,\nreinforce Sir Gerald Graham, and smash up the Mahdi? They could not make\nup their minds. So far as Zobeir was concerned, there were two\ncounterbalancing considerations; on the one hand, Evelyn Baring now\ndeclared that he was in favour of the appointment; but, on the other\nhand, would English public opinion consent to a man, described by Gordon\nhimself as 'the greatest slave-hunter who ever existed', being given an\nEnglish subsidy and the control of the Sudan? While the Cabinet was\nwavering, Gordon took a fatal step. The delay was intolerable, and one\nevening, in a rage, he revealed his desire for Zobeir--which had\nhitherto been kept a profound official secret--to Mr Power, the English\nConsul at Khartoum, and the special correspondent of \"The Times.\"\nPerhaps he calculated that the public announcement of his wishes would\noblige the Government to yield to them; if so, he was completely\nmistaken, for the result was the very reverse. The country, already\nstartled by the proclamation in favour of slavery, could not swallow\nZobeir. The Anti-Slavery Society set on foot a violent agitation,\nopinion in the House of Commons suddenly stiffened, and the Cabinet, by\na substantial majority, decided that Zobeir should remain in Cairo. The\nimperialist wave had risen high, but it had not risen high enough; and\nnow it was rapidly subsiding. The Government's next action was decisive.\nSir Gerald Graham and his British Army were withdrawn from the Sudan.\n\nThe critical fortnight during which these events took place was the\nfirst fortnight of March. By the close of it, Gordon's position had\nundergone a rapid and terrible change. Not only did he find himself\ndeprived, by the decision of the Government, both of the hope of\nZobeir's assistance and of the prospect of smashing up the Mahdi with\nthe aid of British troops; the military movements in the Eastern Sudan\nproduced, at the very same moment, a yet more fatal consequence. The\nadherents of the Mahdi had been maddened, they had not been crushed, by\nSir Gerald Graham's victories. When, immediately afterwards, the English\nwithdrew to Suakin, from which they never again emerged, the inference\nseemed obvious; they had been defeated, and their power was at an end.\nThe warlike tribes to the north and the northeast of Khartoum had long\nbeen wavering. They now hesitated no longer, and joined the Mahdi. From\nthat moment--it was less than a month from Gordon's arrival at\nKhartoum--the situation of the town was desperate. The line of\ncommunications was cut. Though it still might be possible for occasional\nnative messengers, or for a few individuals on an armed steamer, to win\ntheir way down the river into Egypt, the removal of a large number of\npersons--the loyal inhabitants or the Egyptian garrison--was\nhenceforward an impossibility. The whole scheme of the Gordon mission\nhad irremediably collapsed; worse still, Gordon himself, so far from\nhaving effected the evacuation of the Sudan, was surrounded by the\nenemy. 'The question now is,' Sir Evelyn Baring told Lord Granville, on\nMarch 24th, 'how to get General Gordon and Colonel Stewart away from\nKhartoum.'\n\nThe actual condition of the town, however, was not, from a military\npoint of view, so serious as Colonel Coetlogon, in the first moments of\npanic after the Hicks disaster, had supposed. Gordon was of opinion that\nit was capable of sustaining a siege of many months. With his usual\nvigour, he had already begun to prepare an elaborate system of\nearthworks, mines, and wire entanglements. There was a five or six\nmonths' supply of food, there was a great quantity of ammunition, the\ngarrison numbered about 8,000 men. There were, besides, nine small\npaddle-wheel steamers, hitherto used for purposes of communication along\nthe Nile, which, fitted with guns and protected by metal plates, were of\nconsiderable military value. 'We are all right,' Gordon told his sister\non March 15th. 'We shall, D. V., go on for months.' So far, at any rate,\nthere was no cause for despair. But the effervescent happiness of three\nweeks since had vanished. Gloom, doubt, disillusionment,\nself-questioning, had swooped down again upon their victim.\n\n'Either I must believe He does all things in mercy and love, or else I\ndisbelieve His existence; there is no half way in the matter. What holes\ndo I not put myself into! And for what? So mixed are my ideas. I believe\nambition put me here in this ruin.'\n\nWas not that the explanation of it all? 'Our Lord's promise is not for\nthe fulfilment of earthly wishes; therefore, if things come to ruin here\nHe is still faithful, and is carrying out His great work of divine\nwisdom.' How could he have forgotten that? But he would not transgress\nagain. 'I owe all to God, and nothing to myself, for, humanly speaking,\nI have done very foolish things. However, if I am humbled, the better\nfor me.'\n\nNews of the changed circumstances at Khartoum was not slow in reaching\nEngland, and a feeling of anxiety began to spread. Among the first to\nrealise the gravity of the situation was Queen Victoria. 'It is\nalarming,' she telegraphed to Lord Hartington on March 25th. 'General\nGordon is in danger; you are bound to try to save him ... You have\nincurred a fearful responsibility.' With an unerring instinct, Her\nMajesty forestalled and expressed the popular sentiment. During April,\nwhen it had become clear that the wire between Khartoum and Cairo had\nbeen severed; when, as time passed, no word came northward, save vague\nrumours of disaster; when at last a curtain of impenetrable mystery\nclosed over Khartoum, the growing uneasiness manifested itself in\nletters to the newspapers, in leading articles, and in a flood of\nsubscriptions towards a relief fund. At the beginning of May, the public\nalarm reached a climax. It now appeared to be certain, not only that\nGeneral Gordon was in imminent danger, but that no steps had yet been\ntaken by the Government to save him.\n\nOn the 5th, there was a meeting of protest and indignation at St.\nJames's Hall; on the 9th there was a mass meeting in Hyde Park; on the\n11th there was a meeting at Manchester. The Baroness Burdett-Coutts\nwrote an agitated letter to \"The Times\" begging for further\nsubscriptions. Somebody else proposed that a special fund should be\nstarted with which 'to bribe the tribes to secure the General's personal\nsafety'. A country vicar made another suggestion. Why should not public\nprayers be offered up for General Gordon in every church in the kingdom?\nHe himself had adopted that course last Sunday. 'Is not this,' he\nconcluded, 'what the godly man, the true hero, himself would wish to be\ndone?' It was all of no avail. General Gordon remained in peril; the\nGovernment remained inactive. Finally, a vote of censure was moved in\nthe House of Commons; but that too proved useless. It was strange; the\nsame executive which, two months before, had trimmed its sails so\neagerly to the shifting gusts of popular opinion, now, in spite of a\nrising hurricane, held on its course. A new spirit, it was clear--a\ndetermined, an intractable spirit--had taken control of the Sudan\nsituation. What was it? The explanation was simple, and it was ominous.\nMr. Gladstone had intervened.\n\nThe old statesman was now entering upon the penultimate period of his\nenormous career. He who had once been the rising hope of the stern and\nunbending Tories, had at length emerged, after a lifetime of\ntransmutations, as the champion of militant democracy. He was at the\napex of his power. His great rival was dead; he stood pre-eminent in the\neye of the nation; he enjoyed the applause, the confidence, the\nadmiration, the adoration, even, of multitudes. Yet--such was the\npeculiar character of the man, and such was the intensity of the\nfeelings which he called forth--at this very moment, at the height of\nhis popularity, he was distrusted and loathed; already an unparalleled\nanimosity was gathering its forces against him. For, indeed, there was\nsomething in his nature which invited--which demanded--the clashing\nreactions of passionate extremes. It was easy to worship Mr. Gladstone;\nto see in him the perfect model of the upright man--the man of virtue\nand of religion--the man whose whole life had been devoted to the\napplication of high principles to affairs of State; the man, too, whose\nsense of right and justice was invigorated and ennobled by an\nenthusiastic heart. It was also easy to detest him as a hypocrite, to\ndespise him as a demagogue, and to dread him as a crafty manipulator of\nmen and things for the purposes of his own ambition.\n\nIt might have been supposed that one or other of these conflicting\njudgments must have been palpably absurd, that nothing short of gross\nprejudice or wilful blindness, on one side or the other, could reconcile\nsuch contradictory conceptions of a single human being. But it was not\nso; 'the elements' were 'so mixed' in Mr. Gladstone that his bitterest\nenemies (and his enemies were never mild) and his warmest friends (and\nhis friends were never tepid) could justify, with equal plausibility,\ntheir denunciations or their praises. What, then, was the truth? In the\nphysical universe there are no chimeras. But man is more various than\nnature; was Mr. Gladstone, perhaps, a chimera of the spirit? Did his\nvery essence lie in the confusion of incompatibles? His very essence? It\neludes the hand that seems to grasp it. One is baffled, as his political\nopponents were baffled fifty years ago. The soft serpent coils harden\ninto quick strength that has vanished, leaving only emptiness and\nperplexity behind. Speech was the fibre of his being; and, when he\nspoke, the ambiguity of ambiguity was revealed. The long, winding,\nintricate sentences, with their vast burden of subtle and complicated\nqualifications, befogged the mind like clouds, and like clouds, too,\ndropped thunder bolts. Could it not then at least be said of him with\ncertainty that his was a complex character? But here also there was a\ncontradiction.\n\nIn spite of the involutions of his intellect and the contortions of his\nspirit, it is impossible not to perceive a strain of naivete in Mr.\nGladstone. He adhered to some of his principles that of the value of\nrepresentative institutions, for instance with a faith which was\nsingularly literal; his views upon religion were uncritical to\ncrudeness; he had no sense of humour. Compared with Disraeli's, his\nattitude towards life strikes one as that of an ingenuous child. His\nvery egoism was simple-minded; through all the labyrinth of his passions\nthere ran a single thread. But the centre of the labyrinth? Ah! the\nthread might lead there, through those wandering mazes, at last. Only,\nwith the last corner turned, the last step taken, the explorer might\nfind that he was looking down into the gulf of a crater. The flame shot\nout on every side, scorching and brilliant; but in the midst, there was\na darkness.\n\nThat Mr. Gladstone's motives and ambitions were not merely those of a\nhunter after popularity was never shown more clearly than in that part\nof his career which, more than any other, has been emphasised by his\nenemies--his conduct towards General Gordon. He had been originally\nopposed to Gordon's appointment, but he had consented to it partly,\nperhaps, owing to the persuasion that its purpose did not extend beyond\nthe making of a 'report'. Gordon once gone, events had taken their own\ncourse; the policy of the Government began to slide, automatically, down\na slope at the bottom of which lay the conquest of the Sudan and the\nannexation of Egypt. Sir Gerald Graham's bloody victories awoke Mr.\nGladstone to the true condition of affairs; he recognised the road he\nwas on and its destination; but there was still time to turn back.\n\nIt was he who had insisted upon the withdrawal of the English army from\nthe Eastern Sudan. The imperialists were sadly disappointed. They had\nsupposed that the old lion had gone to sleep, and suddenly he had come\nout of his lair, and was roaring. All their hopes now centred upon\nKhartoum. General Gordon was cut off; he was surrounded, he was in\ndanger; he must be relieved. A British force must be sent to save him.\nBut Mr. Gladstone was not to be caught napping a second time. When the\nagitation rose, when popular sentiment was deeply stirred, when the\ncountry, the Press, the Sovereign herself, declared that the national\nhonour was involved with the fate of General Gordon, Mr. Gladstone\nremained immovable. Others might picture the triumphant rescue of a\nChristian hero from the clutches of heathen savages; before HIS eyes was\nthe vision of battle, murder, and sudden death, the horrors of defeat\nand victory, the slaughter and the anguish of thousands, the violence of\nmilitary domination, the enslavement of a people.\n\nThe invasion of the Sudan, he had flashed out in the House of Commons,\nwould be a war of conquest against a people struggling to be free. 'Yes,\nthose people are struggling to be free, and they are rightly struggling\nto be free.' Mr. Gladstone--it was one of his old-fashioned\nsimplicities--believed in liberty. If, indeed, it should turn out to be\nthe fact that General Gordon was in serious danger, then, no doubt, it\nwould be necessary to send a relief expedition to Khartoum. But, he\ncould see no sufficient reason to believe that it was the fact.\nCommunications, it was true, had been interrupted between Khartoum and\nCairo, but no news was not necessarily bad news, and the little\ninformation that had come through from General Gordon seemed to indicate\nthat he could hold out for months. So his agile mind worked, spinning\nits familiar web of possibilities and contingencies and fine\ndistinctions. General Gordon, he was convinced, might be hemmed in, but\nhe was not surrounded. Surely, it was the duty of the Government to take\nno rash step, but to consider and to inquire, and, when it acted, to act\nupon reasonable conviction. And then, there was another question. If it\nwas true--and he believed it was true--that General Gordon's line of\nretreat was open, why did not General Gordon use it?\n\nPerhaps he might be unable to withdraw the Egyptian garrison, but it was\nnot for the sake of the Egyptian garrison that the relief expedition was\nproposed; it was simply and solely to secure the personal safety of\nGeneral Gordon. And General Gordon had it in his power to secure his\npersonal safety himself; and he refused to do so; he lingered on in\nKhartoum, deliberately, wilfully, in defiance of the obvious wishes of\nhis superiors. Oh! it was perfectly clear what General Gordon was doing:\nhe was trying to force the hand of the English Government. He was hoping\nthat if he only remained long enough at Khartoum, he would oblige the\nEnglish Government to send an army into the Sudan which should smash up\nthe Mahdi. That, then, was General Gordon's calculation! Well, General\nGordon would learn that he had made a mistake. Who was he that he should\ndare to imagine that he could impose his will upon Mr. Gladstone? The\nold man's eyes glared. If it came to a struggle between them--well, they\nshould see! As the weeks passed, the strange situation grew tenser. It\nwas like some silent deadly game of bluff. And who knows what was\npassing in the obscure depths of that terrifying spirit? What mysterious\nmixture of remorse, rage, and jealousy? Who was it that was ultimately\nresponsible for sending General Gordon to Khartoum? But then, what did\nthat matter? Why did not the man come back? He was a Christian hero,\nwasn't he? Were there no other Christian heroes in the world? A\nChristian hero! Let him wait until the Mahdi's ring was really round\nhim, until the Mahdi's spear was really about to fall! That would be the\ntest of heroism! If he slipped back then, with his tail between his\nlegs--! The world would judge.\n\nOne of the last telegrams sent by Gordon before the wire was cut seemed\nto support exactly Mr. Gladstone's diagnosis of the case. He told Sir\nEvelyn Baring that, since the Government refused to send either an\nexpedition or Zobeir, he would 'consider himself free to act according\nto circumstances.' 'Eventually,' he said, 'you will be forced to smash\nup the Mahdi', and he declared that if the Government persisted in its\npresent line of conduct, it would be branded with an 'indelible\ndisgrace'. The message was made public, and it happened that Mr.\nGladstone saw it for the first time in a newspaper, during a country\nvisit. Another of the guests, who was in the room at the moment, thus\ndescribes the scene: 'He took up the paper, his eye instantly fell on\nthe telegram, and he read it through. As he read, his face hardened and\nwhitened, the eyes burned as I have seen them once or twice in the House\nof Commons when he was angered--burned with a deep fire, as if they\nwould have consumed the sheet on which Gordon's message was printed, or\nas if Gordon's words had burned into his soul, which was looking out in\nwrath and flame. He said not a word. For perhaps two or three minutes he\nsat still, his face all the while like the face you may read of in\nMilton--like none other I ever saw. Then he rose, still without a word,\nand was seen no more that morning.'\n\nIt is curious that Gordon himself never understood the part that Mr.\nGladstone was playing in his destiny. His Khartoum journals put this\nbeyond a doubt. Except for one or two slight and jocular references to\nMr. Gladstone's minor idiosyncrasies--the shape of his collars, and his\npassion for felling trees, Gordon leaves him unnoticed while he lavishes\nhis sardonic humour upon Lord Granville. But in truth Lord Granville was\na nonentity. The error shows how dim the realities of England had grown\nto the watcher in Khartoum. When he looked towards home, the figure that\nloomed largest upon his vision was--it was only natural that it should\nhave been so the nearest--it was upon Sir Evelyn Baring that he fixed\nhis gaze. For him, Sir Evelyn Baring was the embodiment of England--or\nrather the embodiment of the English official classes, of English\ndiplomacy, of the English Government with its hesitations, its\ninsincerities, its double-faced schemes. Sir Evelyn Baring, he almost\ncame to think at moments, was the prime mover, the sole contriver, of\nthe whole Sudan imbroglio.\n\nIn this he was wrong; for Sir Evelyn Baring, of course, was an\nintermediary, without final responsibility or final power; but Gordon's\nprofound antipathy, his instinctive distrust, were not without their\njustification. He could never forget that first meeting in Cairo, six\nyears earlier, when the fundamental hostility between the two men had\nleapt to the surface. 'When oil mixes with water,' he said, 'we will mix\ntogether.' Sir Evelyn Baring thought so too; but he did not say so; it\nwas not his way. When he spoke, he felt no temptation to express\neverything that was in his mind. In all he did, he was cautious,\nmeasured, unimpeachably correct. It would be difficult to think of a man\nmore completely the antithesis of Gordon. His temperament, all in\nmonochrome, touched in with cold blues and indecisive greys, was\neminently unromantic. He had a steely colourlessness, and a steely\npliability, and a steely strength. Endowed beyond most men with the\ncapacity of foresight, he was endowed as very few men have ever been\nwith that staying-power which makes the fruit of foresight attainable.\nHis views were long, and his patience was even longer. He progressed\nimperceptibly; he constantly withdrew; the art of giving way he\npractised with the refinement of a virtuoso. But, though the steel\nrecoiled and recoiled, in the end it would spring forward. His life's\nwork had in it an element of paradox. It was passed entirely in the\nEast; and the East meant very little to him; he took no interest in it.\nIt was something to be looked after. It was also a convenient field for\nthe talents of Sir Evelyn Baring. Yet it must not be supposed that he\nwas cynical; perhaps he was not quite great enough for that. He looked\nforward to a pleasant retirement--a country place--some literary\nrecreations. He had been careful to keep up his classics. His ambition\ncan be stated in a single phrase--it was to become an institution; and\nhe achieved it. No doubt, too, he deserved it. The greatest of poets, in\na bitter mood, has described the characteristics of a certain class of\npersons, whom he did not like. 'They,' he says,\n\n    'that have power to hurt and will do none,\n    That do not do the things they most do show,\n    Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\n    Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,\n    They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,\n    And husband nature's riches from expense;\n    They are the lords and owners of their faces ...'\n\nThe words might have been written for Sir Evelyn Baring.\n\nThough, as a rule, he found it easy to despise those with whom he came\ninto contact, he could not altogether despise General Gordon. If he\ncould have, he would have disliked him less. He had gone as far as his\ncaution had allowed him in trying to prevent the fatal appointment; and\nthen, when it had become clear that the Government was insistent, he had\nyielded with a good grace. For a moment, he had imagined that all might\nyet be well; that he could impose himself, by the weight of his position\nand the force of his sagacity, upon his self-willed subordinate; that he\ncould hold him in a leash at the end of the telegraph wire to Khartoum.\nVery soon he perceived that this was a miscalculation. To his disgust,\nhe found that the telegraph wire, far from being an instrument of\nofficial discipline, had been converted by the agile strategist at the\nother end of it into a means of extending his own personality into the\ndeliberations at Cairo. Every morning Sir Evelyn Baring would find upon\nhis table a great pile of telegrams from Khartoum--twenty or thirty at\nleast; and as the day went on, the pile would grow. When a sufficient\nnumber had accumulated he would read them all through, with the greatest\ncare. There upon the table, the whole soul of Gordon lay before him--in\nits incoherence, its eccentricity, its impulsiveness, its romance; the\njokes, the slang, the appeals to the prophet Isaiah, the whirl of\ncontradictory policies--Sir Evelyn Baring did not know which exasperated\nhim most. He would not consider whether, or to what degree, the man was\na maniac; no, he would not. A subacid smile was the only comment he\nallowed himself. His position, indeed, was an extremely difficult one,\nand all his dexterity would be needed if he was to emerge from it with\ncredit.\n\nOn one side of him was a veering and vacillating Government; on the\nother, a frenzied enthusiast. It was his business to interpret to the\nfirst the wishes, or rather the inspirations, of the second, and to\nconvey to the second the decisions, or rather the indecisions, of the\nfirst. A weaker man would have floated helplessly on the ebb and flow of\nthe Cabinet's wavering policies; a rasher man would have plunged\nheadlong into Gordon's schemes. He did neither; with a singular courage\nand a singular caution he progressed along a razor-edge. He devoted all\nhis energies to the double task of evolving a reasonable policy out of\nGordon's intoxicated telegrams, and of inducing the divided Ministers at\nhome to give their sanction to what he had evolved. He might have\nsucceeded, if he had not had to reckon with yet another irreconcilable;\nTime was a vital element in the situation, and Time was against him.\nWhen the tribes round Khartoum rose, the last hope of a satisfactory\nsolution vanished. He was the first to perceive the altered condition of\naffairs; long before the Government, long before Gordon himself, he\nunderstood that the only remaining question was that of the extrication\nof the Englishmen from Khartoum. He proposed that a small force should\nbe dispatched at once across the desert from Suakin to Barber, the point\non the Nile nearest to the Red Sea, and thence up the river to Gordon;\nbut, after considerable hesitation, the military authorities decided\nthat this was not a practicable plan. Upon that, he foresaw, with\nperfect lucidity, the inevitable development of events. Sooner or later,\nit would be absolutely necessary to send a relief expedition to\nKhartoum; and, from that premise, it followed, without a possibility of\ndoubt, that it was the duty of the Government to do so at once. This he\nsaw quite clearly; but he also saw that the position in the Cabinet had\nnow altered, that Mr. Gladstone had taken the reins into his own hands.\nAnd Mr. Gladstone did not wish to send a relief expedition. What was Sir\nEvelyn Baring to do? Was he to pit his strength against Mr. Gladstone's?\nTo threaten resignation? To stake his whole future upon General Gordon's\nfate? For a moment he wavered; he seemed to hint that unless the\nGovernment sent a message to Khartoum promising a relief expedition\nbefore the end of the year, he would be unable to be a party to their\nacts. The Government refused to send any such message; and he perceived,\nas he tells us, that 'it was evidently useless to continue the\ncorrespondence any further'. After all, what could he do? He was still\nonly a secondary figure; his resignation would be accepted; he would be\ngiven a colonial governorship and Gordon would be no nearer safety. But\nthen, could he sit by and witness a horrible catastrophe, without\nlifting a hand? Of all the odious dilemmas which that man had put him\ninto this, he reflected, was the most odious. He slightly shrugged his\nshoulders. No; he might have 'power to hurt', but he would 'do none'. He\nwrote a dispatch--a long, balanced, guarded, grey dispatch, informing\nthe Government that he 'ventured to think' that it was 'a question\nworthy of consideration whether the naval and military authorities\nshould not take some preliminary steps in the way of preparing boats,\netc., so as to be able to move, should the necessity arise'. Then,\nwithin a week, before the receipt of the Government's answer, he left\nEgypt. From the end of April until the beginning of September--during\nthe most momentous period of the whole crisis, he was engaged in London\nupon a financial conference, while his place was taken in Cairo by a\nsubstitute. With a characteristically convenient unobtrusiveness, Sir\nEvelyn Baring had vanished from the scene.\n\nMeanwhile, far to the southward, over the wide-spreading lands watered\nby the Upper Nile and its tributaries, the power and the glory of him\nwho had once been Mohammed Ahmed were growing still. In the\nBahr-el-Ghazal, the last embers of resistance were stamped out with the\ncapture of Lupton Bey, and through the whole of that vast province three\ntimes the size of England--every trace of the Egyptian Government was\nobliterated. Still farther south the same fate was rapidly overtaking\nEquatoria, where Emir Pasha, withdrawing into the unexplored depths of\nCentral Africa, carried with him the last vestiges of the old order. The\nMahdi himself still lingered in his headquarters at El Obeid; but, on\nthe rising of the tribes round Khartoum, he had decided that the time\nfor an offensive movement had come, and had dispatched an arm of 30,000\nmen to lay siege to the city. At the same time, in a long and elaborate\nproclamation, in which he asserted, with all the elegance of oriental\nrhetoric, both the sanctity of his mission and the invincibility of his\ntroops, he called upon the inhabitants to surrender. Gordon read aloud\nthe summons to the assembled townspeople; with one voice they declared\nthat they were ready to resist. This was a false Mahdi, they said; God\nwould defend the right; they put their trust in the Governor-General.\nThe most learned Sheikh in the town drew up a theological reply,\npointing out that the Mahdi did not fulfil the requirements of the\nancient prophets. At his appearance, had the Euphrates dried up and\nrevealed a hill of gold? Had contradiction and difference ceased upon\nthe earth? And, moreover, did not the faithful know that the true Mahdi\nwas born in the year of the Prophet 255, from which it surely followed\nthat he must be now 1,046 years old? And was it not clear to all men\nthat this pretender was not a tenth of that age?\n\nThese arguments were certainly forcible; but the Mahdi's army was more\nforcible still. The besieged sallied out to the attack; they were\ndefeated; and the rout that followed was so disgraceful that two of the\ncommanding officers were, by Gordon's orders, executed as traitors. From\nthat moment the regular investment of Khartoum began. The Arab generals\ndecided to starve the town into submission. When, after a few weeks of\ndoubt, it became certain that no British force was on its way from\nSuakin to smash up the Mahdi, and when, at the end of May, Berber, the\nlast connecting link between Khartoum and the outside world, fell into\nthe hands of the enemy, Gordon set his teeth, and sat down to wait and\nto hope, as best he might. With unceasing energy he devoted himself to\nthe strengthening of his defences and the organisation of his\nresources--to the digging of earthworks, the manufacture of ammunition,\nthe collection and the distribution of food. Every day there were\nsallies and skirmishes; every day his little armoured steamboats paddled\nup and down the river, scattering death and terror as they went.\nWhatever the emergency, he was ready with devices and expedients. When\nthe earthworks were still uncompleted he procured hundreds of yards of\ncotton, which he dyed the colour of earth, and spread out in long,\nsloping lines, so as to deceive the Arabs, while the real works were\nbeing prepared farther back. When a lack of money began to make itself\nfelt, he printed and circulated a paper coinage of his own. To combat\nthe growing discontent and disaffection of the townspeople, he\ninstituted a system of orders and medals; the women were not forgotten;\nand his popularity redoubled. There was terror in the thought that harm\nmight come to the Governor-General. Awe and reverence followed him;\nwherever he went he was surrounded by a vigilant and jealous guard, like\nsome precious idol, some mascot of victory. How could he go away? How\ncould he desert his people? It was impossible. It would be, as he\nhimself exclaimed in one of his latest telegrams to Sir Evelyn Baring,\n'the climax of meanness', even to contemplate such an act. Sir Evelyn\nBaring thought differently. In his opinion it was General Gordon's plain\nduty to have come away from Khartoum. To stay involved inevitably a\nrelief expedition--a great expense of treasure and the loss of valuable\nlives; to come away would merely mean that the inhabitants of Khartoum\nwould be 'taken prisoner by the Mahdi'. So Sir Evelyn Baring put it; but\nthe case was not quite so simple as that. When Berber fell, there had\nbeen a massacre lasting for days--an appalling orgy of loot and lust and\nslaughter; when Khartoum itself was captured, what followed was still\nmore terrible. Decidedly, it was no child's play to be 'taken prisoner\nby the Mahdi'. And Gordon was actually there, among those people, in\nclosest intercourse with them, responsible, beloved. Yes; no doubt. But\nwas that in truth, his only motive? Did he not wish in reality, by\nlingering in Khartoum, to force the hand of the Government? To oblige\nthem, whether they would or no, to send an army to smash up the Mahdi?\nAnd was that fair? Was THAT his duty? He might protest, with his last\nbreath, that he had 'tried to do his duty'; Sir Evelyn Baring, at any\nrate, would not agree.\n\nBut Sir Evelyn Baring was inaudible, and Gordon now cared very little\nfor his opinions. Is it possible that, if only for a moment, in his\nextraordinary predicament, he may have listened to another and a very\ndifferent voice--a voice of singular quality, a voice which--for so one\nwould fain imagine--may well have wakened some familiar echoes in his\nheart? One day, he received a private letter from the Mahdi. The letter\nwas accompanied by a small bundle of clothes.\n\n'In the name of God!' wrote the Mahdi, 'herewith a suit of clothes,\nconsisting of a coat (jibbeh), an overcoat, a turban, a cap, a girdle,\nand beads. This is the clothing of those who have given up this world\nand its vanities, and who look for the world to come, for everlasting\nhappiness in Paradise. If you truly desire to come to God and seek to\nlive a godly life, you must at once wear this suit, and come out to\naccept your everlasting good fortune.'\n\nDid the words bear no meaning to the mystic of Gravesend? But he was an\nEnglish gentleman, an English officer. He flung the clothes to the\nground, and trampled on them in the sight of all. Then, alone, he went\nup to the roof of his high palace, and turned the telescope once more,\nalmost mechanically, towards the north.\n\nBut nothing broke the immovability of that hard horizon; and, indeed,\nhow was it possible that help should come to him now? He seemed to be\nutterly abandoned. Sir Evelyn Baring had disappeared into his financial\nconference. In England, Mr. Gladstone had held firm, had outfaced the\nHouse of Commons, had ignored the Press. He appeared to have triumphed.\nThough it was clear that no preparations of any kind were being made for\nthe relief of Gordon, the anxiety and agitation of the public, which had\nrisen so suddenly to such a height of vehemence, had died down. The\ndangerous beast had been quelled by the stern eye of its master. Other\nquestions became more interesting--the Reform Bill, the Russians, the\nHouse of Lords. Gordon, silent in Khartoum, had almost dropped out of\nremembrance. And yet, help did come after all. And it came from an\nunexpected quarter. Lord Hartington had been for some time convinced\nthat he was responsible for Gordon's appointment; and his conscience was\nbeginning to grow uncomfortable.\n\nLord Hartington's conscience was of a piece with the rest of him. It was\nnot, like Mr. Gladstone's, a salamander-conscience--an intangible,\ndangerous creature, that loved to live in the fire; nor was it, like\nGordon's, a restless conscience; nor, like Sir Evelyn Baring's, a\ndiplomatic conscience; it was a commonplace affair. Lord Hartington\nhimself would have been disgusted by any mention of it. If he had been\nobliged, he would have alluded to it distantly; he would have muttered\nthat it was a bore not to do the proper thing. He was usually bored--for\none reason or another; but this particular form of boredom he found more\nintense than all the rest. He would take endless pains to avoid it. Of\ncourse, the whole thing was a nuisance--an obvious nuisance; and\neveryone else must feel just as he did about it. And yet people seemed\nto have got it into their heads that he had some kind of special faculty\nin such matters--that there was some peculiar value in his judgment on a\nquestion of right and wrong. He could not understand why it was; but\nwhenever there was a dispute about cards in a club, it was brought to\nhim to settle. It was most odd. But it was trite. In public affairs, no\nless than in private, Lord Hartington's decisions carried an\nextraordinary weight. The feeling of his idle friends in high society\nwas shared by the great mass of the English people; here was a man they\ncould trust. For indeed he was built upon a pattern which was very dear\nto his countrymen. It was not simply that he was honest: it was that his\nhonesty was an English honesty--an honest which naturally belonged to\none who, so it seemed to them, was the living image of what an\nEnglishman should be.\n\nIn Lord Hartington they saw, embodied and glorified, the very qualities\nwhich were nearest to their hearts--impartiality, solidity, common\nsense--the qualities by which they themselves longed to be\ndistinguished, and by which, in their happier moments, they believed\nthey were. If ever they began to have misgivings, there, at any rate,\nwas the example of Lord Hartington to encourage them and guide\nthem--Lord Hartington who was never self-seeking, who was never excited,\nand who had no imagination at all. Everything they knew about him fitted\ninto the picture, adding to their admiration and respect. His fondness\nfor field sports gave them a feeling of security; and certainly there\ncould be no nonsense about a man who confessed to two ambitions--to\nbecome Prime Minister and to win the Derby--and who put the second above\nthe first. They loved him for his casualness--for his inexactness--for\nrefusing to make life a cut-and-dried business--for ramming an official\ndispatch of high importance into his coat-pocket, and finding it there,\nstill unopened, at Newmarket, several days later. They loved him for his\nhatred of fine sentiments; they were delighted when they heard that at\nsome function, on a florid speaker's avowing that 'this was the proudest\nmoment of his life', Lord Hartington had growled in an undertone 'the\nproudest moment of my life was when MY pig won the prize at Skipton\nFair'. Above all, they loved him for being dull. It was the greatest\ncomfort--with Lord Hartington they could always be absolutely certain\nthat he would never, in any circumstances, be either brilliant, or\nsubtle, or surprising, or impassioned, or profound. As they sat,\nlistening to his speeches, in which considerations of stolid plainness\nsucceeded one another with complete flatness, they felt, involved and\nsupported by the colossal tedium, that their confidence was finally\nassured. They looked up, and took their fill of the sturdy, obvious\npresence. The inheritor of a splendid dukedom might almost have passed\nfor a farm hand. Almost, but not quite. For an air that was difficult to\nexplain, of preponderating authority, lurked in the solid figure; and\nthe lordly breeding of the House of Cavendish was visible in the large,\nlong, bearded, unimpressionable face.\n\nOne other characteristic--the necessary consequence, or, indeed, it\nmight almost be said, the essential expression, of all the\nrest--completes the portrait: Lord Hartington was slow. He was slow in\nmovement, slow in apprehension, slow in thought and the communication of\nthought, slow to decide, and slow to act. More than once this\ndisposition exercised a profound effect upon his career. A private\nindividual may, perhaps, be slow with impunity; but a statesman who is\nslow--whatever the force of his character and the strength of his\njudgment--can hardly escape unhurt from the hurrying of Time's winged\nchariot, can hardly hope to avoid some grave disaster or some\nirretrievable mistake. The fate of General Gordon, so intricately\ninterwoven with such a mass of complicated circumstance with the\npolicies of England and of Egypt, with the fanaticism of the Mahdi, with\nthe irreproachability of Sir Evelyn Baring, with Mr. Gladstone's\nmysterious passions--was finally determined by the fact that Lord\nHartington was slow. If he had been even a very little quicker--if he\nhad been quicker by two days ... but it could not be. The ponderous\nmachinery took so long to set itself in motion; the great wheels and\nlevers, once started, revolved with such a laborious, such a painful\ndeliberation, that at last their work was accomplished--surely, firmly,\ncompletely, in the best English manner, and too late.\n\nSeven stages may be discerned in the history of Lord Hartington's\ninfluence upon the fate of General Gordon. At the end of the first\nstage, he had become convinced that he was responsible for Gordon's\nappointment to Khartoum. At the end of the second, he had perceived that\nhis conscience would not allow him to remain inactive in the face of\nGordon's danger. At the end of the third, he had made an attempt to\ninduce the Cabinet to send an expedition to Gordon's relief. At the end\nof the fourth, he had realised that the Cabinet had decided to postpone\nthe relief of Gordon indefinitely. At the end of the fifth, he had come\nto the conclusion that he must put pressure upon Mr. Gladstone. At the\nend of the sixth, he had attempted to put pressure upon Mr. Gladstone,\nand had not succeeded. At the end of the seventh, he had succeeded in\nputting pressure upon Mr. Gladstone; the relief expedition had been\nordered; he could do no more.\n\nThe turning-point in this long and extraordinary process occurred\ntowards the end of April, when the Cabinet, after the receipt of Sir\nEvelyn Baring's final dispatch, decided to take no immediate measures\nfor Gordon's relief. From that moment it was clear that there was only\none course open to Lord Hartington--to tell Mr. Gladstone that he would\nresign unless a relief expedition was sent. But it took him more than\nthree months to come to this conclusion. He always found the proceedings\nat Cabinet meetings particularly hard to follow. The interchange of\nquestion and answer, of proposal and counterproposal, the crowded\ncounsellors, Mr. Gladstone's subtleties, the abrupt and complicated\nresolutions--these things invariably left him confused and perplexed.\nAfter the crucial Cabinet at the end of April, he came away in a state\nof uncertainty as to what had occurred; he had to write to Lord\nGranville to find out; and by that time, of course, the Government's\ndecision had been telegraphed to Egypt. Three weeks later, in the middle\nof May, he had grown so uneasy that he felt himself obliged to address a\ncircular letter to the Cabinet proposing that preparations for a relief\nexpedition should be set on foot at once. And then he began to\nunderstand that nothing would ever be done until Mr. Gladstone, by some\nmeans or other, had been forced to give his consent. A singular combat\nfollowed. The slippery old man perpetually eluded the cumbrous grasp of\nhis antagonist. He delayed, he postponed, he raised interminable\ndifficulties, he prevaricated, he was silent, he disappeared. Lord\nHartington was dauntless. Gradually, inch by inch, he drove the Prime\nMinister into a corner. But in the meantime many weeks had passed. On\nJuly 1st, Lord Hartington was still remarking that he 'really did not\nfeel that he knew the mind or intention of the Government in respect of\nthe relief of General Gordon'. The month was spent in a succession of\nstubborn efforts to wring from Mr. Gladstone some definite statement\nupon the question. It was useless. On July 31st, Lord Hartington did the\ndeed. He stated that, unless an expedition was sent, he would resign. It\nwas, he said, 'a question of personal honour and good faith, and I don't\nsee how I can yield upon it'. His conscience had worked itself to rest\nat last.\n\nWhen Mr. Gladstone read the words, he realised that the game was over.\nLord Hartington's position in the Liberal Party was second only to his\nown; he was the leader of the rich and powerful Whig aristocracy; his\ninfluence with the country was immense. Nor was he the man to make idle\nthreats of resignation; he had said he would resign, and resign he\nwould: the collapse of the Government would be the inevitable result. On\nAugust 5th, therefore, Parliament was asked to make a grant of L300,000,\nin order 'to enable Her Majesty's Government to undertake operations for\nthe relief of General Gordon, should they become necessary'. The money\nwas voted; and even then, at that last hour, Mr. Gladstone made another,\nfinal, desperate twist. Trying to save himself by the proviso which he\nhad inserted into the resolution, he declared that he was still\nunconvinced of the necessity of any operations at all. 'I nearly,' he\nwrote to Lord Hartington, 'but not quite, adopt words received today\nfrom Granville. \"It is clear, I think, that Gordon has our messages, and\ndoes not choose to answer them.\"' Nearly, but not quite! The\nqualification was masterly; but it was of no avail. This time, the\nsinuous creature was held by too firm a grasp. On August 26th, Lord\nWolseley was appointed to command the relief expedition; and on\nSeptember 9th, he arrived in Egypt.\n\nThe relief expedition had begun, and at the same moment a new phase\nopened at Khartoum. The annual rising of the Nile was now sufficiently\nadvanced to enable one of Gordon's small steamers to pass over the\ncataracts down to Egypt in safety. He determined to seize the\nopportunity of laying before the authorities in Cairo and London, and\nthe English public at large, an exact account of his position. A cargo\nof documents, including Colonel Stewart's Diary of the siege and a\npersonal appeal for assistance addressed by Gordon to all the European\npowers, was placed on board the Abbas; four other steamers were to\naccompany her until she was out of danger from attacks by the Mahdi's\ntroops; after which, she was to proceed alone into Egypt. On the evening\nof September 9th, just as she was about to start, the English and French\nConsuls asked for permission to go with her--a permission which Gordon,\nwho had long been anxious to provide for their safety, readily granted.\nThen Colonel Stewart made the same request; and Gordon consented with\nthe same alacrity.\n\nColonel Stewart was the second-in-command at Khartoum; and it seems\nstrange that he should have made a proposal which would leave Gordon in\na position of the gravest anxiety without a single European subordinate.\nBut his motives were to be veiled forever in a tragic obscurity. The\nAbbas and her convoy set out. Henceforward the Governor-General was\nalone. He had now, definitely and finally, made his decision. Colonel\nStewart and his companions had gone, with every prospect of returning\nunharmed to civilisation. Mr. Gladstone's belief was justified; so far\nas Gordon's personal safety was concerned, he might still, at this late\nhour, have secured it. But he had chosen--he stayed at Khartoum.\n\nNo sooner were the steamers out of sight than he sat down at his\nwriting-table and began that daily record of his circumstances, his\nreflections, and his feelings, which reveals to us, with such an\nauthentic exactitude, the final period of his extraordinary destiny. His\nJournals, sent down the river in batches to await the coming of the\nrelief expedition, and addressed, first to Colonel Stewart, and later to\nthe 'Chief of Staff, Sudan Expeditionary Force', were official\ndocuments, intended for publication, though, as Gordon himself was\ncareful to note on the outer covers, they would 'want pruning out'\nbefore they were printed. He also wrote, on the envelope of the first\nsection, 'No secrets as far as I am concerned'. A more singular set of\nstate papers was never compiled. Sitting there, in the solitude of his\npalace, with ruin closing round him, with anxieties on every hand, with\ndoom hanging above his head, he let his pen rush on for hour after hour\nin an ecstasy of communication, a tireless unburdening of the spirit,\nwhere the most trivial incidents of the passing day were mingled\npell-mell with philosophical disquisitions; where jests and anger, hopes\nand terrors, elaborate justifications and cynical confessions, jostled\none another in reckless confusion. The impulsive, demonstrative man had\nnobody to talk to any more, and so he talked instead to the pile of\ntelegraph forms, which, useless now for perplexing Sir Evelyn Baring,\nserved very well--for they were large and blank--as the repositories of\nhis conversation. His tone was not the intimate and religious tone which\nhe would have used with the Rev. Mr. Barnes or his sister Augusta; it\nwas such as must have been habitual with him in his intercourse with old\nfriends or fellow-officers, whose religious views were of a more\nordinary caste than his own, but with whom he was on confidential terms.\nHe was anxious to put his case to a select and sympathetic audience--to\nconvince such a man as Lord Wolseley that he was justified in what he\nhad done; and he was sparing in his allusions to the hand of Providence,\nwhile those mysterious doubts and piercing introspections, which must\nhave filled him, he almost entirely concealed. He expressed himself, of\ncourse, with eccentric ABANDON--it would have been impossible for him to\ndo otherwise; but he was content to indicate his deepest feelings with a\nfleer. Yet sometimes--as one can imagine happening with him in actual\nconversation--his utterance took the form of a half-soliloquy, a copious\noutpouring addressed to himself more than to anyone else, for his own\nsatisfaction. There are passages in the Khartoum Journals which call up\nin a flash the light, gliding figure, and the blue eyes with the candour\nof childhood still shining in them; one can almost hear the low voice,\nthe singularly distinct articulation, the persuasive--the\nself-persuasive--sentences, following each other so unassumingly between\nthe puffs of a cigarette.\n\nAs he wrote, two preoccupations principally filled his mind. His\nreflections revolved around the immediate past and the impending future.\nWith an unerring persistency he examined, he excused, he explained, his\nshare in the complicated events which had led to his present situation.\nHe rebutted the charges of imaginary enemies; he laid bare the\nineptitude and the faithlessness of the English Government. He poured\nout his satire upon officials and diplomatists. He drew caricatures, in\nthe margin, of Sir Evelyn Baring, with sentences of shocked pomposity\ncoming out of his mouth. In some passages, which the editor of the\nJournals preferred to suppress, he covered Lord Granville with his\nraillery, picturing the Foreign Secretary, lounging away his morning at\nWalmer Castle, opening The Times and suddenly discovering, to his\nhorror, that Khartoum was still holding out. 'Why, HE SAID DISTINCTLY he\ncould ONLY hold out SIX MONTHS, and that was in March (counts the\nmonths). August! why, he ought to have given in! What is to be done?\nThey'll be howling for an expedition.... It is no laughing matter; THAT\nABOMINABLE MAHDI! Why on earth does he not guard his roads better? WHAT\nIS to be done?' Several times in his bitterness he repeats the\nsuggestion that the authorities at home were secretly hoping that the\nfall of Khartoum would relieve them of their difficulties.\n\n'What that Mahdi is about, Lord Granville is made to exclaim in another\ndeleted paragraph, 'I cannot make out. Why does he not put all his guns\non the river and stop the route? Eh what? \"We will have to go to\nKhartoum!\" Why, it will cost millions, what a wretched business! What!\nSend Zobeir? Our conscience recoils from THAT; it is elastic, but not\nequal to that; it is a pact with the Devil.... Do you not think there is\nany way of getting hold of H I M, in a quiet way?'\n\nIf a boy at Eton or Harrow, he declared, had acted as the Government had\nacted, 'I THINK he would be kicked, and I AM SURE he would deserve it'.\nHe was the victim of hypocrites and humbugs. There was 'no sort of\nparallel to all this in history--except David with Uriah the Hittite';\nbut then 'there was an Eve in the case', and he was not aware that the\nGovernment had even that excuse.\n\nFrom the past, he turned to the future, and surveyed, with a disturbed\nand piercing vision, the possibilities before him. Supposing that the\nrelief expedition arrived, what would be his position? Upon one thing he\nwas determined: whatever happened, he would not play the part of 'the\nrescued lamb'. He vehemently asserted that the purpose of the expedition\ncould only be the relief of the Sudan garrisons; it was monstrous to\nimagine that it had been undertaken merely to ensure his personal\nsafety. He refused to believe it. In any case,\n\n'I declare POSITIVELY,' he wrote, with passionate underlinings. 'AND\nONCE FOR ALL, THAT I WILL NOT LEAVE THE SUDAN UNTIL EVERY ONE WHO WANTS\nTO GO DOWN IS GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO SO, UNLESS a government is\nestablished which relieves me of the charge; therefore, if any emissary\nor letter comes up here ordering me to comedown, I WILL NOT OBEY IT, BUT\nWILL STAY HERE AND FALL WITH THE TOWN, AND RUN ALL RISKS'.\n\nThis was sheer insubordination, no doubt; but he could not help that; it\nwas not in his nature to be obedient. 'I know if I was chief, I would\nnever employ myself, for I am incorrigible.' Decidedly, he was not\nafraid to be 'what club men call insubordinate, though, of all\ninsubordinates, the club men are the worst'.\n\nAs for the government which was to replace him, there were several\nalternatives: an Egyptian Pasha might succeed him as Governor-General,\nor Zobeir might be appointed after all, or the whole country might be\nhanded over to the Sultan. His fertile imagination evolved scheme after\nscheme; and his visions of his own future were equally various. He would\nwithdraw to the Equator; he would be delighted to spend Christmas in\nBrussels; he would ... at any rate he would never go back to England.\nThat was certain.\n\n'I dwell on the joy of never seeing Great Britain again, with its\nhorrid, wearisome dinner-parties and miseries. How we can put up with\nthose things, passes my imagination! It is a perfect bondage ... I would\nsooner live 'like a Dervish with the Mahdi, than go out to dinner every\nnight in London. I hope, if any English general comes to Khartoum, he\nwill not ask me to dinner. Why men cannot be friends without bringing\nthe wretched stomachs in, is astounding.'\n\nBut would an English general ever have the opportunity of asking him to\ndinner in Khartoum? There were moments when terrible misgivings assailed\nhim. He pieced together his scraps of intelligence with feverish\nexactitude; he calculated times, distances, marches. 'If,' he wrote on\nOctober 24th, they do not come before 30th November, the game is up, and\nRule Britannia.' Curious premonitions came into his mind. When he heard\nthat the Mahdi was approaching in person, it seemed to be the fulfilment\nof a destiny, for he had 'always felt we were doomed to come face to\nface'. What would be the end of it all? 'It is, of course, on the\ncards,' he noted, 'that Khartoum is taken under the nose of the\nExpeditionary Force, which will be JUST TOO LATE.' The splendid hawks\nthat swooped about the palace reminded him of a text in the Bible: 'The\neye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother, the\nravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat\nit.' 'I often wonder,' he wrote, 'whether they are destined to pick my\neyes, for I fear I was not the best of sons.'\n\nSo, sitting late into the night, he filled the empty telegraph forms\nwith the agitations of his spirit, overflowing ever more hurriedly, more\nfuriously, with lines of emphasis, and capitals, and exclamation-marks\nmore and more thickly interspersed, so that the signs of his living\npassion are still visible to the inquirer of today on those thin sheets\nof mediocre paper and in the torrent of the ink. But he was a man of\nelastic temperament; he could not remain forever upon the stretch; he\nsought, and he found, relaxation in extraneous matters--in metaphysical\ndigressions, or in satirical outbursts, or in the small details of his\ndaily life. It amused him to have the Sudanese soldiers brought in and\nshown their 'black pug faces' in the palace looking-glasses. He watched\nwith a cynical sympathy the impertinence of a turkey-cock that walked in\nhis courtyard. He made friends with a mouse who, 'judging from her\nswelled-out appearance', was a lady, and came and ate out of his plate.\nThe cranes that flew over Khartoum in their thousands, and with their\ncurious cry, put him in mind of the poems of Schiller, which few ever\nread, but which he admired highly, though he only knew them in Bulwer's\ntranslation. He wrote little disquisitions on Plutarch and purgatory, on\nthe fear of death and on the sixteenth chapter of the Koran. Then the\nturkey-cock, strutting with 'every feather on end, and all the colours\nof the rainbow on his neck', attracted him once more, and he filled\nseveral pages with his opinions upon the immortality of animals,\ndrifting on to a discussion of man's position in the universe, and the\ninfinite knowledge of God. It was all clear to him. And yet--'what a\ncontradiction, is life! I hate Her Majesty's Government for their\nleaving the Sudan after having caused all its troubles, yet I believe\nour Lord rules heaven and earth, so I ought to hate Him, which I\n(sincerely) do not.'\n\nOne painful thought obsessed him. He believed that the two Egyptian\nofficers, who had been put to death after the defeat in March, had been\nunjustly executed. He had given way to 'outside influences'; the two\nPashas had been 'judicially murdered'. Again and again he referred to\nthe incident with a haunting remorse. \"The Times\", perhaps, would\nconsider that he had been justified; but what did that matter? 'If The\nTimes saw this in print, it would say, \"Why, then, did you act as you\ndid?\" to which I fear I have no answer.' He determined to make what\nreparation he could, and to send the families of the unfortunate Pashas\nL1,000 each.\n\nOn a similar, but a less serious, occasion, he put the same principle\ninto action. He boxed the ears of a careless telegraph clerk--'and then,\nas my conscience pricked me, I gave him $5. He said he did not mind if I\nkilled him--I was his father (a chocolate-coloured youth of twenty).'\nHis temper, indeed, was growing more and more uncertain, as he himself\nwas well aware. He observed with horror that men trembled when they came\ninto his presence--that their hands shook so that they could not hold a\nmatch to a cigarette.\n\nHe trusted no one. Looking into the faces of those who surrounded him,\nhe saw only the ill-dissimulated signs of treachery and dislike. Of the\n40,000 inhabitants of Khartoum he calculated that two-thirds were\nwilling--were perhaps anxious--to become the subjects of the Mahdi.\n'These people are not worth any great sacrifice,' he bitterly observed.\nThe Egyptian officials were utterly incompetent; the soldiers were\ncowards. All his admiration was reserved for his enemies. The meanest of\nthe Mahdi's followers was, he realised, 'a determined warrior, who could\nundergo thirst and privation, who no more cared for pain or death than\nif he were stone'. Those were the men whom, if the choice had lain with\nhim, he would have wished to command. And yet, strangely enough, he\npersistently underrated the strength of the forces against him. A\nhandful of Englishmen--a handful of Turks would, he believed, be enough\nto defeat the Mahdi's hosts and destroy his dominion. He knew very\nlittle Arabic, and he depended for his information upon a few ignorant\nEnglish-speaking subordinates. The Mahdi himself he viewed with\nambiguous feelings. He jibed at him as a vulgar impostor; but it is easy\nto perceive, under his scornful jocularities, the traces of an uneasy\nrespect.\n\nHe spent long hours upon the palace roof, gazing northwards; but the\nveil of mystery and silence was unbroken. In spite of the efforts of\nMajor Kitchener, the officer in command of the Egyptian Intelligence\nService, hardly any messengers ever reached Khartoum; and when they did,\nthe information they brought was tormentingly scanty. Major Kitchener\ndid not escape the attentions of Gordon's pen. When news came at last,\nit was terrible: Colonel Stewart and his companions had been killed. The\nAbbas, after having passed uninjured through the part of the river\ncommanded by the Mahdi's troops, had struck upon a rock; Colonel Stewart\nhad disembarked in safety; and, while he was waiting for camels to\nconvey the detachment across the desert into Egypt, had accepted the\nhospitality of a local Sheikh. Hardly had the Europeans entered the\nSheikh's hut when they were set upon and murdered; their native\nfollowers shared their fate. The treacherous Sheikh was an adherent of\nthe Mahdi, and to the Mahdi all Colonel Stewart's papers, filled with\ninformation as to the condition of Khartoum, were immediately sent. When\nthe first rumours of the disaster reached Gordon, he pictured, in a\nflash of intuition, the actual details of the catastrophe. 'I feel\nsomehow convinced,' he wrote, they were captured by treachery ...\nStewart was not a bit suspicious (I am made up of it). I can see in\nimagination the whole scene, the Sheikh inviting them to land ... then a\nrush of wild Arabs, and all is over!' 'It is very sad,' he added, 'but\nbeing ordained, we must not murmur.' And yet he believed that the true\nresponsibility lay with him; it was the punishment of his own sins. 'I\nlook on it,' was his unexpected conclusion, 'as being a Nemesis on the\ndeath of the two Pashas.'\n\nThe workings of his conscience did indeed take on surprising shapes. Of\nthe three ex-governors of Darfur, Bahr-el-Ghazal, and Equatoria, Emin\nPasha had disappeared, Lupton Bey had died, and Slatin Pasha was held in\ncaptivity by the Mahdi. By birth an Austrian and a Catholic, Slatin, in\nthe last desperate stages of his resistance, had adopted the expedient\nof announcing his conversion to Mohammedanism, in order to win the\nconfidence of his native troops. On his capture, the fact of his\nconversion procured him some degree of consideration; and, though he\noccasionally suffered from the caprices of his masters, he had so far\nescaped the terrible punishment which had been meted out to some other\nof the Mahdi's European prisoners--that of close confinement in the\ncommon gaol. He was now kept prisoner in one of the camps in the\nneighbourhood of Khartoum. He managed to smuggle through a letter to\nGordon, asking for assistance, in case he could make his escape. To this\nletter Gordon did not reply. Slatin wrote again and again; his piteous\nappeals, couched in no less piteous French, made no effect upon the\nheart of the Governor-General.\n\n'Excellence!' he wrote, 'J'ai envoye deux lettres, sans avoir recu une\nreponse de votre excellence.... Excellence! j'ai me battu 27 FOIS pour\nle gouvernement contre l'ennemi--on m'a feri deux fois, et j'ai rien\nfait contre l'honneur--rien de chose qui doit empeche votre excellence\nde m'ecrir une reponse que je sais quoi faire. JE VOUS PRIE, Excellence,\nde m'honore avec une reponse. P.S. Si votre Excellence ont peutetre\nentendu que j'ai fait quelque chose contre l'honneur d'un officier et\ncela vous empeche de m'ecrir, je vous prie de me donner l'occasion de me\ndefendre, et jugez apres la verite.'\n\nThe unfortunate Slatin understood well enough the cause of Gordon's\nsilence. It was in vain that he explained the motives of his conversion,\nin vain that he pointed out that it had been made easier for him since\nhe had, 'PERHAPS UNHAPPILY, not received a strict religious education at\nhome'. Gordon was adamant. Slatin had 'denied his Lord', and that was\nenough. His communications with Khartoum were discovered and he was put\nin chains. When Gordon heard of it, he noted the fact grimly in his\ndiary, without a comment.\n\nA more ghastly fate awaited another European who had fallen into the\nhands of the Mahdi. Clavier Pain, a French adventurer, who had taken\npart in the Commune, and who was now wandering, for reasons which have\nnever been discovered, in the wastes of the Sudan, was seized by the\nArabs, made prisoner, and hurried from camp to camp. He was attacked by\nfever; but mercy was not among the virtues of the savage soldiers who\nheld him in their power. Hoisted upon the back of a camel, he was being\ncarried across the desert, when, overcome by weakness, he lost his hold,\nand fell to the ground. Time or trouble were not to be wasted upon an\ninfidel. Orders were given that he should be immediately buried; the\norders were carried out; and in a few moments the cavalcade had left the\nlittle hillock far behind. But some of those who were present believed\nthat Olivier Pain had been still breathing when his body was covered\nwith the sand.\n\nGordon, on hearing that a Frenchman had been captured by the Mahdi,\nbecame extremely interested. The idea occurred to him that this\nmysterious individual was none other than Ernest Renan, 'who,' he wrote,\nin his last publication 'takes leave of the world, and is said to have\ngone into Africa, not to reappear again'. He had met Renan at the rooms\nof the Royal Geographical Society, had noticed that he looked bored--the\nresult, no doubt, of too much admiration--and had felt an instinct that\nhe would meet him again. The instinct now seemed to be justified. There\ncould hardly be any doubt that it WAS Renan; who else could it be? 'If\nhe comes to the lines,' he decided, 'and it is Renan, I shall go and see\nhim, for whatever one may think of his unbelief in our Lord, he\ncertainly dared to say what he thought, and he has not changed his creed\nto save his life.' That the mellifluous author of the Vie de Jesus\nshould have determined to end his days in the depths of Africa, and have\ncome, in accordance with an intuition, to renew his acquaintance with\nGeneral Gordon in the lines of Khartoum, would indeed have been a\nstrange occurrence; but who shall limit the strangeness of the\npossibilities that lie in wait for the sons of men? At that very moment,\nin the south-eastern corner of the Sudan, another Frenchman, of a\npeculiar eminence, was fulfilling a destiny more extraordinary than the\nwildest romance. In the town of Harrar, near the Red Sea, Arthur Rimbaud\nsurveyed with splenetic impatience the tragedy of Khartoum.\n\n'C'est justement les Anglais,' he wrote, 'avec leur absurde politique,\nqui minent desormais le commerce de toutes ces cotes. Ils ont voulu tout\nremanier et ils sont arrives a faire pire que les Egyptiens et les\nTurcs, ruines par eux. Leur Gordon est un idiot, leur Wolseley un ane,\net toutes leurs entreprises une suite insensee d'absurdites et de\ndepredations.'\n\nSo wrote the amazing poet of the Saison d'Enfer amid those futile\nturmoils of petty commerce, in which, with an inexplicable deliberation,\nhe had forgotten the enchantments of an unparalleled adolescence,\nforgotten the fogs of London and the streets of Brussels, forgotten\nParis, forgotten the subtleties and the frenzies of inspiration,\nforgotten the agonised embraces of Verlaine.\n\nWhen the contents of Colonel Stewart's papers had been interpreted to\nthe Mahdi, he realised the serious condition of Khartoum, and decided\nthat the time had come to press the siege to a final conclusion. At the\nend of October, he himself, at the head of a fresh army, appeared\noutside the town. From that moment, the investment assumed a more and\nmore menacing character. The lack of provisions now for the first time\nbegan to make itself felt. November 30th--the date fixed by Gordon as\nthe last possible moment of his resistance--came and went; the\nExpeditionary Force had made no sign. The fortunate discovery of a large\nstore of grain, concealed by some merchants for purposes of speculation,\nonce more postponed the catastrophe. But the attacking army grew daily\nmore active; the skirmishes around the lines and on the river more\ndamaging to the besieged; and the Mahdi's guns began an intermittent\nbombardment of the palace. By December 10th it was calculated that there\nwas not fifteen days' food in the town; 'truly I am worn to a shadow\nwith the food question', Gordon wrote; 'it is one continuous demand'. At\nthe same time he received the ominous news that five of his soldiers had\ndeserted to the Mahdi. His predicament was terrible; but he calculated,\nfrom a few dubious messages that had reached him, that the relieving\nforce could not be very far away. Accordingly, on the 14th, he decided\nto send down one of his four remaining steamers, the Bordeen, to meet it\nat Metemmah, in order to deliver to the officer in command the latest\ninformation as to the condition of the town. The Bordeen carried down\nthe last portion of the Journals, and Gordon's final messages to his\nfriends. Owing to a misunderstanding, he believed that Sir Evelyn Baring\nwas accompanying the expedition from Egypt, and some of his latest and\nmost successful satirical fancies played around the vision of the\ndistressed Consul-General perched for days upon the painful eminence of\na camel's hump. 'There was a slight laugh when Khartoum heard Baring was\nbumping his way up here--a regular Nemesis.' But, when Sir Evelyn Baring\nactually arrived--in whatever condition--what would happen? Gordon lost\nhimself in the multitude of his speculations. His own object, he\ndeclared, was, 'of course, to make tracks'. Then in one of his strange\npremonitory rhapsodies, he threw out, half in jest and half in earnest,\nthat the best solution of all the difficulties of the future would be\nthe appointment of Major Kitchener as Governor-General of the Sudan. The\nJournal ended upon a note of menace and disdain:\n\n'Now MARK THIS, if the Expeditionary Force, and I ask for no more than\n200 men, does not come in ten days, the town may fall; and I have done\nmy best for the honour of our country. Good-bye.--C. G. GORDON.\n\n'You send me no information, though you have lots of money. C. G. G.'\n\nTo his sister Augusta he was more explicit.\n\n'I decline to agree,' he told her, 'that the expedition comes for my\nrelief; it comes for the relief of the garrisons, which I failed to\naccomplish. I expect Her Majesty's Government are in a precious rage\nwith me for holding out and forcing their hand.'\n\nThe admission is significant. And then came the final adieux.\n\n'This may be the last letter you will receive from me, for we are on our\nlast legs, owing to the delay of the expedition. However, God rules all,\nand, as He will rule to His glory and our welfare, His will be done. I\nfear, owing to circumstances, that my affairs are pecuniarily not over\nbright ... your affectionate brother, C. G. GORDON.\n\n'P.S. I am quite happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence, I have TRIED to\ndo my duty.'\n\nThe delay of the expedition was even more serious than Gordon had\nsupposed. Lord Wolseley had made the most elaborate preparations. He had\ncollected together a picked army of 10,000 of the finest British troops;\nhe had arranged a system of river transports with infinite care. For it\nwas his intention to take no risks; he would advance in force up the\nNile; he had determined that the fate of Gordon should not depend upon\nthe dangerous hazards of a small and hasty exploit. There is no\ndoubt--in view of the opposition which the relieving force actually met\nwith--that his decision was a wise one; but unfortunately, he had\nmiscalculated some of the essential elements in the situation. When his\npreparations were at last complete, it was found that the Nile had sunk\nso low that the flotillas, over which so much care had been lavished,\nand upon which depended the whole success of the campaign, would be\nunable to surmount the cataracts. At the same time--it was by then the\nmiddle of November--a message arrived from Gordon indicating that\nKhartoum was in serious straits. It was clear that an immediate advance\nwas necessary; the river route was out of the question; a swift dash\nacross the desert was the only possible expedient after all. But no\npreparations for land transport had been made; weeks elapsed before a\nsufficient number of camels could be collected; and more weeks before\nthose collected were trained for military march. It was not until\nDecember 30th--more than a fortnight after the last entry in Gordon's\nJournal--that Sir Herbert Stewart, at the head of 1,100 British troops,\nwas able to leave Korti on his march towards Metemmah, 170 miles across\nthe desert. His advance was slow, and it was tenaciously disputed by,\nthe Mahdi's forces. There was a desperate engagement on January 17th at\nthe wells of Abu Klea; the British square was broken; for a moment\nvictory hung in the balance; but the Arabs were repulsed. On the 19th\nthere was another furiously contested fight, in which Sir Herbert\nStewart was killed. On the 21st, the force, now diminished by over 250\ncasualties, reached Metemmah. Three days elapsed in reconnoitering the\ncountry, and strengthening the position of the camp. On the 24th, Sir\nCharles Wilson, who had succeeded to the command, embarked on the\nBordeen, and started up the river for Khartoum. On the following\nevening, the vessel struck on a rock, causing a further delay of\ntwenty-four hours. It was not until January 28th that Sir Charles\nWilson, arriving under a heavy fire within sight of Khartoum, saw that\nthe Egyptian flag was not flying from the roof of the palace. The signs\nof ruin and destruction on every hand showed clearly enough that the\ntown had fallen. The relief expedition was two days late.\n\nThe details of what passed within Khartoum during the last weeks of the\nsiege are unknown to us. In the diary of Bordeini Bey, a Levantine\nmerchant, we catch a few glimpses of the final stages of the\ncatastrophe--of the starving populace, the exhausted garrison, the\nfluctuations of despair and hope, the dauntless energy of the\nGovernor-General. Still he worked on, indefatigably, apportioning\nprovisions, collecting ammunition, consulting with the townspeople,\nencouraging the soldiers. His hair had suddenly turned quite white. Late\none evening, Bordeini Bey went to visit him in the palace, which was\nbeing bombarded by the Mahdi's cannon. The high building, brilliantly\nlighted up, afforded an excellent mark. As the shot came whistling\naround the windows, the merchant suggested that it would be advisable to\nstop them up with boxes full of sand. Upon this, Gordon Pasha became\nenraged.\n\n'He called up the guard, and gave them orders to shoot me if I moved; he\nthen brought a very large lantern which would hold twenty-four candles.\nHe and I then put the candles into the sockets, placed the lantern on\nthe table in front of the window, lit the candles, and then we sat down\nat the table. The Pasha then said, \"When God was portioning out fear to\nall the people in the world, at last it came to my turn, and there was\nno fear left to give me. Go, tell all the people in Khartoum that Gordon\nfears nothing, for God has created him without fear.\"'\n\nOn January 5th, Omdurman, a village on the opposite bank of the Nile,\nwhich had hitherto been occupied by the besieged, was taken by the\nArabs. The town was now closely surrounded, and every chance of\nobtaining fresh supplies was cut off. The famine became terrible; dogs,\ndonkeys, skins, gum, palm fibre, were devoured by the desperate\ninhabitants. The soldiers stood on the fortifications like pieces of\nwood. Hundreds died of hunger daily: their corpses filled the streets;\nand the survivors had not the strength to bury the dead. On the 20th,\nthe news of the battle of Abu Klea reached Khartoum. The English were\ncoming at last. Hope rose; every morning the Governor-General assured\nthe townspeople that one day more would see the end of their sufferings;\nand night after night his words were proved untrue.\n\nOn the 23rd, a rumour spread that a spy had arrived with letters, and\nthat the English army was at hand. A merchant found a piece of newspaper\nlying in the road, in which it was stated that the strength of the\nrelieving forces was 15,000 men. For a moment, hope flickered up again,\nonly to relapse once more. The rumour, the letters, the printed paper,\nall had been contrivances of Gordon to inspire the garrison with the\ncourage to hold out. On the 25th, it was obvious that the Arabs were\npreparing an attack, and a deputation of the principal inhabitants\nwaited upon the Governor-General. But he refused to see them; Bordeini\nBey was alone admitted to his presence. He was sitting on a divan, and,\nas Bordeini Bey came into the room, he snatched the fez from his head\nand flung it from him.\n\n'What more can I say?' he exclaimed, in a voice such as the merchant had\nnever heard before. 'The people will no longer believe me. I have told\nthem over and over again that help would be here, but it has never come,\nand now they must see I tell them lies. I can do nothing more. Go, and\ncollect all the people you can on the lines, and make a good stand. Now\nleave me to smoke these cigarettes.'\n\nBordeini Bey knew then, he tells us, that Gordon Pasha was in despair.\nHe left the room, having looked upon the Governor-General for the last\ntime.\n\nWhen the English force reached Metemmah, the Mahdi, who had originally\nintended to reduce Khartoum to surrender through starvation, decided to\nattempt its capture by assault. The receding Nile had left one portion\nof the town's circumference undefended; as the river withdrew, the\nrampart had crumbled; a broad expanse of mud was left between the wall\nand the water, and the soldiers, overcome by hunger and the lassitude of\nhopelessness, had trusted to the morass to protect them, and neglected\nto repair the breach. Early on the morning of the 26th, the Arabs\ncrossed the river at this point. The mud, partially dried up, presented\nno obstacle; nor did the ruined fortification, feebly manned by some\nhalf-dying troops. Resistance was futile, and it was scarcely offered:\nthe Mahdi's army swarmed into Khartoum. Gordon had long debated with\nhimself what his action should be at the supreme moment. 'I shall never\n(D.V.),' he had told Sir Evelyn Baring, 'be taken alive.' He had had\ngunpowder put into the cellars of the palace, so that the whole building\nmight, at a moment's notice, be blown into the air. But then misgivings\nhad come upon him; was it not his duty 'to maintain the faith, and, if\nnecessary, to suffer for it'?--to remain a tortured and humiliated\nwitness of his Lord in the Mahdi's chains? The blowing up of the palace\nwould have, he thought, 'more or less the taint of suicide', would be,\nin a way, taking things out of God's hands'. He remained undecided; and\nmeanwhile, to be ready for every contingency, he kept one of his little\narmoured vessels close at hand on the river, with steam up, day and\nnight, to transport him, if so he should decide, southward, through the\nenemy, to the recesses of Equatoria. The sudden appearance of the Arabs,\nthe complete collapse of the defence, saved him the necessity of making\nup his mind. He had been on the roof, in his dressing-gown, when the\nattack began; and he had only time to hurry to his bedroom, to slip on a\nwhite uniform, and to seize up a sword and a revolver, before the\nforemost of the assailants were in the palace. The crowd was led by four\nof the fiercest of the Mahdi's followers--tall and swarthy Dervishes,\nsplendid in their many-coloured jibbehs, their great swords drawn from\ntheir scabbards of brass and velvet, their spears flourishing above\ntheir heads. Gordon met them at the top of the staircase. For a moment,\nthere was a deathly pause, while he stood in silence, surveying his\nantagonists. Then it is said that Taha Shahin, the Dongolawi, cried in a\nloud voice, 'Mala' oun el yom yomek!' (O cursed one, your time is come),\nand plunged his spear into the Englishman's body. His only reply was a\ngesture of contempt. Another spear transfixed him; he fell, and the\nswords of the three other Dervishes instantly hacked him to death. Thus,\nif we are to believe the official chroniclers, in the dignity of\nunresisting disdain, General Gordon met his end. But it is only fitting\nthat the last moments of one whose whole life was passed in\ncontradiction should be involved in mystery and doubt. Other witnesses\ntold a very different story. The man whom they saw die was not a saint\nbut a warrior. With intrepidity, with skill, with desperation, he flew\nat his enemies. When his pistol was exhausted, he fought on with his\nsword; he forced his way almost to the bottom of the staircase; and,\namong, a heap of corpses, only succumbed at length to the sheer weight\nof the multitudes against him.\n\nThat morning, while Slatin Pasha was sitting in his chains in the camp\nat Omdurman, he saw a group of Arabs approaching, one of whom was\ncarrying something wrapped up in a cloth. As the group passed him, they\nstopped for a moment, and railed at him in savage mockery. Then the\ncloth was lifted, and he saw before him Gordon's head. The trophy was\ntaken to the Mahdi: at last the two fanatics had indeed met face to\nface. The Mahdi ordered the head to be fixed between the branches of a\ntree in the public highway, and all who passed threw stones at it. The\nhawks of the desert swept and circled about it--those very hawks which\nthe blue eyes had so often watched.\n\nThe news of the catastrophe reached England, and a great outcry arose.\nThe public grief vied with the public indignation. The Queen, in a\nletter to Miss Gordon, immediately gave vent both to her own sentiments\nand those of the nation.\n\n'HOW shall I write to you,' she exclaimed, 'or how shall I attempt to\nexpress WHAT I FEEL! To THINK of your dear, noble, heroic Brother, who\nserved his Country and his Queen so truly, so heroically, with a\nself-sacrifice so edifying to the World, not having been rescued. That\nthe promises of support were not fulfilled--which I so frequently and\nconstantly pressed on those who asked him to go--is to me GRIEF\nINEXPRESSIBLE! Indeed, it has made me ill ... Would you express to your\nother sisters and your elder Brother my true sympathy, and what I do so\nkeenly feel, the STAIN left upon England, for your dear Brother's cruel,\nthough heroic, fate!'\n\nIn reply, Miss Gordon presented the Queen with her brother's Bible,\nwhich was placed in one of the corridors at Windsor, open, on a white\nsatin cushion, and enclosed in a crystal case. In the meanwhile, Gordon\nwas acclaimed in every newspaper as a national martyr; State services\nwere held in his honour at Westminster and St Paul's; L20,000 was voted\nto his family; and a great sum of money was raised by subscription to\nendow a charity in his memory. Wrath and execration fell, in particular,\nupon the head of Mr. Gladstone. He was little better than a murderer; he\nwas a traitor; he was a heartless villain, who had been seen at the play\non the very night when Gordon's death was announced. The storm passed;\nbut Mr. Gladstone had soon to cope with a still more serious agitation.\nThe cry was raised on every side that the national honour would be\nirreparably tarnished if the Mahdi were left in the peaceful possession\nof Khartoum, and that the Expeditionary Force should be at once employed\nto chastise the false prophet and to conquer the Sudan. But it was in\nvain that the imperialists clamoured; in vain that Lord Wolseley wrote\nseveral dispatches, proving over and over again that to leave the Mahdi\nunconquered must involve the ruin of Egypt; in vain that Lord Hartington\nat last discovered that he had come to the same conclusion. The old man\nstood firm. Just then, a crisis with Russia on the Afghan frontier\nsupervened; and Mr. Gladstone, pointing out that every available soldier\nmight be wanted at any moment for a European war, withdrew Lord Wolseley\nand his army from Egypt. The Russian crisis disappeared. The Mahdi\nremained supreme lord of the Sudan.\n\nAnd yet it was not with the Mahdi that the future lay. Before six months\nwere out, in the plenitude of his power, he died, and the Khalifa\nAbdullahi reigned in his stead. The future lay with Major Kitchener and\nhis Maxim-Nordenfeldt guns. Thirteen years later the Mahdi's empire was\nabolished forever in the gigantic hecatomb of Omdurman; after which it\nwas thought proper that a religious ceremony in honour of General Gordon\nshould be held at the palace at Khartoum. The service was conducted by\nfour chaplains--of the Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist\npersuasions--and concluded with a performance of 'Abide with Me'--the\nGeneral's favourite hymn--by a select company of Sudanese buglers. Every\none agreed that General Gordon had been avenged at last. Who could doubt\nit? General Gordon himself, possibly, fluttering, in some remote\nNirvana, the pages of a phantasmal Bible, might have ventured on a\nsatirical remark. But General Gordon had always been a contradictious\nperson--even a little off his head, perhaps, though a hero; and besides,\nhe was no longer there to contradict ... At any rate, it had all ended\nvery happily--in a glorious slaughter of 20,000 Arabs, a vast addition\nto the British Empire, and a step in the Peerage for Sir Evelyn Baring.\n\n    BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n    General Gordon.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1031,"split":"train"}
