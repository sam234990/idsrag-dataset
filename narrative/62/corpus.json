One day he inherits a landed estate from his uncle. When he moves to the country, he strikes up a friendship with his neighbor, a starry-eyed young poet named Vladimir Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fianc\u0102\u0160e, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech is often referred to as Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.\nLater, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana's name day celebration promising a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of St. Petersburg he has grown tired of. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fianc\u0102\u0160 and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to deaden his feelings of remorse.\nTatyana visits Onegin's mansion, where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins, and begins to question whether Onegin's character is merely a collage of different literary heroes, and if there is, in fact, no \"real Onegin\".\nSeveral years pass, and the scene shifts to St. Petersburg. Onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once turned away. Now she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, despite the fact that she is married. However, his attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply. Eventually Onegin manages to see Tatyana and presents to her the opportunity to finally elope after they have become reacquainted. Does he desire her only for her wealth and position? She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him regretting his bitter destiny.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Eugene Oneguine [Onegin], by Aleksandr\nSergeevich Pushkin, Translated by Henry Spalding\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

[Henry] Spalding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon\nMacmillan and Co.\n1881\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nEugene Oneguine, the chief poetical work of Russia's greatest poet,\nhaving been translated into all the principal languages of Europe\nexcept our own, I hope that this version may prove an acceptable\ncontribution to literature. Tastes are various in matters of poetry,\nbut the present work possesses a more solid claim to attention in\nthe series of faithful pictures it offers of Russian life and manners.\nIf these be compared with Mr. Wallace's book on Russia, it will be\nseen that social life in that empire still preserves many of the\ncharacteristics which distinguished it half a century ago--the period\nof the first publication of the latter cantos of this poem.\n\nMany references will be found in it to our own country and its\nliterature. Russian poets have carefully plagiarized the English--\nnotably Joukovski. Pushkin, however, was no plagiarist, though\nundoubtedly his mind was greatly influenced by the genius of Byron--\nmore especially in the earliest part of his career. Indeed, as will\nbe remarked in the following pages, he scarcely makes an effort to\ndisguise this fact.\n\nThe biographical sketch is of course a mere outline. I did not think\na longer one advisable, as memoirs do not usually excite much interest\ntill the subjects of them are pretty well known. In the \"notes\" I\nhave endeavored to elucidate a somewhat obscure subject. Some of the\npoet's allusions remain enigmatical to the present day. The point of\neach sarcasm naturally passed out of mind together with the society\nagainst which it was levelled. If some of the versification is rough\nand wanting in \"go,\" I must plead in excuse the difficult form of the\nstanza, and in many instances the inelastic nature of the subject\nmatter to be versified. Stanza XXXV Canto II forms a good example\nof the latter difficulty, and is omitted in the German and French\nversions to which I have had access. The translation of foreign\nverse is comparatively easy so long as it is confined to conventional\npoetic subjects, but when it embraces abrupt scraps of conversation\nand the description of local customs it becomes a much more arduous\naffair. I think I may say that I have adhered closely to the text\nof the original.\n\nThe following foreign translations of this poem have appeared:\n\n1. French prose. Oeuvres choisis de Pouchekine. H.

In one of his letters it is\nrecorded that no less than six Pushkins signed the Charta declaratory\nof the election of the Romanoff family to the throne of Russia, and\nthat two more affixed their marks from inability to write.\n\nIn 1811 he entered the Lyceum, an aristocratic educational\nestablishment at Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, where he was\nthe friend and schoolmate of Prince Gortchakoff the Russian\nChancellor. As a scholar he displayed no remarkable amount of\ncapacity, but was fond of general reading and much given to\nversification. Whilst yet a schoolboy he wrote many lyrical\ncompositions and commenced _Ruslan and Liudmila_, his first poem\nof any magnitude, and, it is asserted, the first readable one ever\nproduced in the Russian language. During his boyhood he came much\ninto contact with the poets Dmitrieff and Joukovski, who were\nintimate with his father, and his uncle, Vassili Pushkin, himself\nan author of no mean repute. The friendship of the historian\nKaramzine must have exercised a still more beneficial influence\nupon him.\n\nIn 1817 he quitted the Lyceum and obtained an appointment in the\nForeign Office at St. Petersburg. Three years of reckless\ndissipation in the capital, where his lyrical talent made him\nuniversally popular, resulted in 1818 in a putrid fever which\nwas near carrying him off. At this period of his life he scarcely\nslept at all; worked all day and dissipated at night. Society was\nopen to him from the palace of the prince to the officers'\nquarters of the Imperial Guard. The reflection of this mode of\nlife may be noted in the first canto of _Eugene Oneguine_ and the\nearly dissipations of the \"Philosopher just turned eighteen,\"--\nthe exact age of Pushkin when he commenced his career in the\nRussian capital.\n\nIn 1820 he was transferred to the bureau of Lieutenant-General\nInzoff, at Kishineff in Bessarabia. This event was probably due\nto his composing and privately circulating an \"Ode to Liberty,\"\nthough the attendant circumstances have never yet been thoroughly\nbrought to light. An indiscreet admiration for Byron most likely\ninvolved the young poet in this scrape. The tenor of this\nproduction, especially its audacious allusion to the murder of\nthe emperor Paul, father of the then reigning Tsar, assuredly\ndeserved, according to aristocratic ideas, the deportation to\nSiberia which was said to have been prepared for the author.\nThe intercession of Karamzine and Joukovski procured a commutation\nof his sentence. Strangely enough, Pushkin appeared anxious to\ndeceive the public as to the real cause of his sudden disappearance\nfrom the capital; for in an Ode to Ovid composed about this time\nhe styles himself a \"voluntary exile.\" (See Note 4 to this volume.)\n\nDuring the four succeeding years he made numerous excursions amid\nthe beautiful countries which from the basin of the Euxine--and\namongst these the Crimea and the Caucasus. A nomad life passed\namid the beauties of nature acted powerfully in developing his\npoetical genius. To this period he refers in the final canto of\n_Eugene Oneguine_ (st. v.), when enumerating the various influences\nwhich had contributed to the formation of his Muse:\n\n     Then, the far capital forgot,\n     Its splendour and its blandishments,\n     In poor Moldavia cast her lot,\n     She visited the humble tents\n     Of migratory gipsy hordes.\n\nDuring these pleasant years of youth he penned some of his most\ndelightful poetical works: amongst these, _The Prisoner of the\nCaucasus, The Fountain of Baktchiserai_, and the _Gipsies_. Of the\ntwo former it may be said that they are in the true style of the\n_Giaour_ and the _Corsair_. In fact, just at that point of time\nByron's fame--like the setting sun--shone out with dazzling lustre\nand irresistibly charmed the mind of Pushkin amongst many others.\nThe _Gipsies_ is more original; indeed the poet himself has been\nidentified with Aleko, the hero of the tale, which may well be\nfounded on his own personal adventures without involving the guilt\nof a double murder. His undisguised admiration for Byron doubtless\nexposed him to imputations similar to those commonly levelled\nagainst that poet. But Pushkin's talent was too genuine for him to\nremain long subservient to that of another, and in a later period\nof his career he broke loose from all trammels and selected a line\npeculiarly his own. Before leaving this stage in our narrative we\nmay point out the fact that during the whole of this period of\ncomparative seclusion the poet was indefatigably occupied in\nstudy. Not only were the standard works of European literature\nperused, but two more languages--namely Italian and Spanish--were\nadded to his original stock: French, English, Latin and German\nhaving been acquired at the Lyceum. To this happy union of\nliterary research with the study of nature we must attribute the\nsudden bound by which he soon afterwards attained the pinnacle of\npoetic fame amongst his own countrymen.\n\nIn 1824 he once more fell under the imperial displeasure. A letter\nseized in the post, and expressive of atheistical sentiments\n(possibly but a transient vagary of his youth) was the ostensible\ncause of his banishment from Odessa to his paternal estate of\nMikhailovskoe in the province of Pskoff. Some, however, aver that\npersonal pique on the part of Count Vorontsoff, the Governor of\nOdessa, played a part in the transaction. Be this as it may, the\nconsequences were serious for the poet, who was not only placed\nunder the surveillance of the police, but expelled from the\nForeign Office by express order of the Tsar \"for bad conduct.\" A\nletter on this subject, addressed by Count Vorontsoff to Count\nNesselrode, is an amusing instance of the arrogance with which\nstolid mediocrity frequently passes judgment on rising genius. I\ntranscribe a portion thereof:\n\n\n     Odessa, _28th March (7th April)_ 1824\n\nCount--Your Excellency is aware of the reasons for which, some\ntime ago, young Pushkin was sent with a letter from Count Capo\nd'Istria to General Inzoff. I found him already here when I\narrived, the General having placed him at my disposal, though he\nhimself was at Kishineff. I have no reason to complain about him.\nOn the contrary, he is much steadier than formerly. But a desire\nfor the welfare of the young man himself, who is not wanting in\nability, and whose faults proceed more from the head than from\nthe heart, impels me to urge upon you his removal from Odessa.\nPushkin's chief failing is ambition. He spent the bathing season\nhere, and has gathered round him a crowd of adulators who praise\nhis genius. This maintains in him a baneful delusion which seems\nto turn his head--namely, that he is a \"distinguished writer;\"\nwhereas, in reality he is but a feeble imitator of an author in\nwhose favour very little can be said (Byron). This it is which\nkeeps him from a serious study of the great classical poets, which\nmight exercise a beneficial effect upon his talents--which cannot\nbe denied him--and which might make of him in course of time a\n\"distinguished writer.\"\n\nThe best thing that can be done for him is to remove him hence....\n\nThe Emperor Nicholas on his accession pardoned Pushkin and received\nhim once more into favour. During an interview which took place it\nis said that the Tsar promised the poet that he alone would in\nfuture be the censor of his productions. Pushkin was restored to\nhis position in the Foreign Office and received the appointment of\nCourt Historian. In 1828 he published one of his finest poems,\n_Poltava_, which is founded on incidents familiar to English\nreaders in Byron's _Mazeppa_. In 1829 the hardy poet accompanied\nthe Russian army which under Paskevitch captured Erzeroum. In 1831\nhe married a beautiful lady of the Gontchareff family and settled\nin the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, where he remained for the\nremainder of his life, only occasionally visiting Moscow and\nMikhailovskoe. During this period his chief occupation consisted\nin collecting and investigating materials for a projected history\nof Peter the Great, which was undertaken at the express desire of\nthe Emperor. He likewise completed a history of the revolt of\nPougatchoff, which occurred in the reign of Catherine II. [Note:\nthis individual having personated Peter III, the deceased husband\nof the Empress, raised the Orenburg Cossacks in revolt. This revolt\nwas not suppressed without extensive destruction of life and\nproperty.] In 1833 the poet visited Orenburg, the scene of the\ndreadful excesses he recorded; the fruit of his journey being one\nof the most charming tales ever written, _The Captain's Daughter_.\n[Note: Translated in _Russian Romance_, by Mrs. Telfer, 1875.]\n\nThe remaining years of Pushkin's life, spent in the midst of\ndomestic bliss and grateful literary occupation, were what\nlookers-on style \"years of unclouded happiness.\" They were,\nhowever, drawing rapidly to a close. Unrivalled distinction rarely\nfails to arouse bitter animosity amongst the envious, and Pushkin's\nexistence had latterly been embittered by groundless insinuations\nagainst his wife's reputation in the shape of anonymous letters\naddressed to himself and couched in very insulting language. He\nfancied he had traced them to one Georges d'Anthes, a Frenchman\nin the Cavalier Guard, who had been adopted by the Dutch envoy\nHeeckeren. D'Anthes, though he had espoused Madame Pushkin's\nsister, had conducted himself with impropriety towards the former\nlady. The poet displayed in this affair a fierce hostility quite\ncharacteristic of his African origin but which drove him to his\ndestruction. D'Anthes, it was subsequently admitted, was not the\nauthor of the anonymous letters; but as usual when a duel is\nproposed, an appeal to reason was thought to smack of cowardice.\nThe encounter took place in February 1837 on one of the islands of\nthe Neva. The weapons used were pistols, and the combat was of a\ndetermined, nay ferocious character. Pushkin was shot before he\nhad time to fire, and, in his fall, the barrel of his pistol\nbecame clogged with snow which lay deep upon the ground at the\ntime. Raising himself on his elbow, the wounded man called for\nanother pistol, crying, \"I've strength left to fire my shot!\" He\nfired, and slightly wounded his opponent, shouting \"Bravo!\" when\nhe heard him exclaim that he was hit. D'Anthes was, however, but\nslightly contused whilst Pushkin was shot through the abdomen. He\nwas transported to his residence and expired after several days\npassed in extreme agony. Thus perished in the thirty-eighth year of\nhis age this distinguished poet, in a manner and amid surroundings\nwhich make the duel scene in the sixth canto of this poem seem\nalmost prophetic. His reflections on the premature death of Lenski\nappear indeed strangely applicable to his own fate, as generally\nto the premature extinction of genius.\n\nPushkin was endowed with a powerful physical organisation. He was\nfond of long walks, unlike the generality of his countrymen, and\nat one time of his career used daily to foot it into St. Petersburg\nand back, from his residence in the suburbs, to conduct his\ninvestigations in the Government archives when employed on the\nHistory of Peter the Great. He was a good swordsman, rode well,\nand at one time aspired to enter the cavalry; but his father not\nbeing able to furnish the necessary funds he declined serving in\nthe less romantic infantry. Latterly he was regular in his habits;\nrose early, retired late, and managed to get along with but very\nlittle sleep. On rising he betook himself forthwith to his literary\noccupations, which were continued till afternoon, when they gave\nplace to physical exercise. Strange as it will appear to many, he\npreferred the autumn months, especially when rainy, chill and\nmisty, for the production of his literary compositions, and was\nproportionally depressed by the approach of spring. (Cf. Canto\nVII st. ii.)\n\n     Mournful is thine approach to me,\n     O Spring, thou chosen time of love\n\nHe usually left St. Petersburg about the middle of September and\nremained in the country till December. In this space of time it was\nhis custom to develop and perfect the inspirations of the\nremaining portion of the year. He was of an impetuous yet\naffectionate nature and much beloved by a numerous circle of\nfriends. An attractive feature in his character was his unalterable\nattachment to his aged nurse, a sentiment which we find reflected\nin the pages of _Eugene Oneguine_ and elsewhere.\n\nThe preponderating influence which Byron exercised in the formation\nof his genius has already been noticed. It is indeed probable that\nwe owe _Oneguine_ to the combined impressions of _Childe Harold_ and\n_Don Juan_ upon his mind. Yet the Russian poem excels these\nmasterpieces of Byron in a single particular--namely, in completeness\nof narrative, the plots of the latter being mere vehicles for the\ndevelopment of the poet's general reflections. There is ground for\nbelieving that Pushkin likewise made this poem the record of his\nown experience. This has doubtless been the practice of many\ndistinguished authors of fiction whose names will readily occur to\nthe reader. Indeed, as we are never cognizant of the real motives\nwhich actuate others, it follows that nowhere can the secret springs\nof human action be studied to such advantage as within our own\nbreasts. Thus romance is sometimes but the reflection of the writer's\nown individuality, and he adopts the counsel of the American poet:\n\n     Look then into thine heart and write!\n\nBut a further consideration of this subject would here be out of\nplace. Perhaps I cannot more suitably conclude this sketch than by\nquoting from his _Ode to the Sea_ the poet's tribute of admiration\nto the genius of Napoleon and Byron, who of all contemporaries seem\nthe most to have swayed his imagination.\n\n     Farewell, thou pathway of the free,\n     For the last time thy waves I view\n     Before me roll disdainfully,\n     Brilliantly beautiful and blue.\n\n     Why vain regret? Wherever now\n     My heedless course I may pursue\n     One object on thy desert brow\n     I everlastingly shall view--\n\n     A rock, the sepulchre of Fame!\n     The poor remains of greatness gone\n     A cold remembrance there became,\n     There perished great Napoleon.\n\n     In torment dire to sleep he lay;\n     Then, as a tempest echoing rolls,\n     Another genius whirled away,\n     Another sovereign of our souls.\n\n     He perished.

Shakespeare and other\nEnglish dramatists had also their share in influencing his mind,\nwhich, at all events in its earlier developments, was of an\nessentially imitative type. As an example of his Shakespearian\ntastes, see his poem of \"Angelo,\" founded upon \"Measure for Measure.\"]\n\nXLIV\n\nWhen will my hour of freedom come!\nTime, I invoke thee! favouring gales\nAwaiting on the shore I roam\nAnd beckon to the passing sails.\nUpon the highway of the sea\nWhen shall I wing my passage free\nOn waves by tempests curdled o'er!\n'Tis time to quit this weary shore\nSo uncongenial to my mind,\nTo dream upon the sunny strand\nOf Africa, ancestral land,(21)\nOf dreary Russia left behind,\nWherein I felt love's fatal dart,\nWherein I buried left my heart.\n\n[Note 21: The poet was, on his mother's side, of African extraction,\na circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of\nhis imagination. His great-grandfather, Abraham Petrovitch Hannibal,\nwas seized on the coast of Africa when eight years of age by a\ncorsair, and carried a slave to Constantinople. The Russian\nAmbassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused\nhim to be baptized at Vilnius. Subsequently one of Hannibal's\nbrothers made his way to Constantinople and thence to St. Petersburg\nfor the purpose of ransoming him; but Peter would not surrender his\ngodson who died at the age of ninety-two, having attained the rank\nof general in the Russian service.]\n\nXLV\n\nEugene designed with me to start\nAnd visit many a foreign clime,\nBut Fortune cast our lots apart\nFor a protracted space of time.\nJust at that time his father died,\nAnd soon Oneguine's door beside\nOf creditors a hungry rout\nTheir claims and explanations shout.\nBut Eugene, hating litigation\nAnd with his lot in life content,\nTo a surrender gave consent,\nSeeing in this no deprivation,\nOr counting on his uncle's death\nAnd what the old man might bequeath.\n\nXLVI\n\nAnd in reality one day\nThe steward sent a note to tell\nHow sick to death his uncle lay\nAnd wished to say to him farewell.\nHaving this mournful document\nPerused, Eugene in postchaise went\nAnd hastened to his uncle's side,\nBut in his heart dissatisfied,\nHaving for money's sake alone\nSorrow to counterfeit and wail--\nThus we began our little tale--\nBut, to his uncle's mansion flown,\nHe found him on the table laid,\nA due which must to earth be paid.\n\nXLVII\n\nThe courtyard full of serfs he sees,\nAnd from the country all around\nHad come both friends and enemies--\nFuneral amateurs abound!\nThe body they consigned to rest,\nAnd then made merry pope and guest,\nWith serious air then went away\nAs men who much had done that day.\nLo! my Oneguine rural lord!\nOf mines and meadows, woods and lakes,\nHe now a full possession takes,\nHe who economy abhorred,\nDelighted much his former ways\nTo vary for a few brief days.\n\nXLVIII\n\nFor two whole days it seemed a change\nTo wander through the meadows still,\nThe cool dark oaken grove to range,\nTo listen to the rippling rill.\nBut on the third of grove and mead\nHe took no more the slightest heed;\nThey made him feel inclined to doze;\nAnd the conviction soon arose,\nEnnui can in the country dwell\nThough without palaces and streets,\nCards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes;\nOn him spleen mounted sentinel\nAnd like his shadow dogged his life,\nOr better,--like a faithful wife.\n\nXLIX\n\nI was for calm existence made,\nFor rural solitude and dreams,\nMy lyre sings sweeter in the shade\nAnd more imagination teems.\nOn innocent delights I dote,\nUpon my lake I love to float,\nFor law I _far niente_ take\nAnd every morning I awake\nThe child of sloth and liberty.\nI slumber much, a little read,\nOf fleeting glory take no heed.\nIn former years thus did not I\nIn idleness and tranquil joy\nThe happiest days of life employ?\n\nL\n\nLove, flowers, the country, idleness\nAnd fields my joys have ever been;\nI like the difference to express\nBetween myself and my Eugene,\nLest the malicious reader or\nSome one or other editor\nOf keen sarcastic intellect\nHerein my portrait should detect,\nAnd impiously should declare,\nTo sketch myself that I have tried\nLike Byron, bard of scorn and pride,\nAs if impossible it were\nTo write of any other elf\nThan one's own fascinating self.\n\nLI\n\nHere I remark all poets are\nLove to idealize inclined;\nI have dreamed many a vision fair\nAnd the recesses of my mind\nRetained the image, though short-lived,\nWhich afterwards the muse revived.\nThus carelessly I once portrayed\nMine own ideal, the mountain maid,\nThe captives of the Salguir's shore.(22)\nBut now a question in this wise\nOft upon friendly lips doth rise:\nWhom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?\nTo whom amongst the jealous throng\nOf maids dost thou inscribe thy song?\n\n[Note 22: Refers to two of the most interesting productions of\nthe poet. The former line indicates the _Prisoner of the\nCaucasus_, the latter, _The Fountain of Baktchiserai_. The\nSalguir is a river of the Crimea.]\n\nLII\n\nWhose glance reflecting inspiration\nWith tenderness hath recognized\nThy meditative incantation--\nWhom hath thy strain immortalized?\nNone, be my witness Heaven above!\nThe malady of hopeless love\nI have endured without respite.\nHappy who thereto can unite\nPoetic transport. They impart\nA double force unto their song\nWho following Petrarch move along\nAnd ease the tortures of the heart--\nPerchance they laurels also cull--\nBut I, in love, was mute and dull.\n\nLIII\n\nThe Muse appeared, when love passed by\nAnd my dark soul to light was brought;\nFree, I renewed the idolatry\nOf harmony enshrining thought.\nI write, and anguish flies away,\nNor doth my absent pen portray\nAround my stanzas incomplete\nYoung ladies' faces and their feet.\nExtinguished ashes do not blaze--\nI mourn, but tears I cannot shed--\nSoon, of the tempest which hath fled\nTime will the ravages efface--\nWhen that time comes, a poem I'll strive\nTo write in cantos twenty-five.\n\nLIV\n\nI've thought well o'er the general plan,\nThe hero's name too in advance,\nMeantime I'll finish whilst I can\nCanto the First of this romance.\nI've scanned it with a jealous eye,\nDiscovered much absurdity,\nBut will not modify a tittle--\nI owe the censorship a little.\nFor journalistic deglutition\nI yield the fruit of work severe.\nGo, on the Neva's bank appear,\nMy very latest composition!\nEnjoy the meed which Fame bestows--\nMisunderstanding, words and blows.\n\n\nEND OF CANTO THE FIRST\n\n\n\nCANTO THE SECOND\n\nThe Poet\n\n\"O Rus!\"--Horace\n\nCanto The Second\n\n[Note: Odessa, December 1823.]\n\nI\n\nThe village wherein yawned Eugene\nWas a delightful little spot,\nThere friends of pure delight had been\nGrateful to Heaven for their lot.\nThe lonely mansion-house to screen\nFrom gales a hill behind was seen;\nBefore it ran a stream. Behold!\nAfar, where clothed in green and gold\nMeadows and cornfields are displayed,\nVillages in the distance show\nAnd herds of oxen wandering low;\nWhilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,\nA thick immense neglected grove\nExtended--haunt which Dryads love.\n\nII\n\n'Twas built, the venerable pile,\nAs lordly mansions ought to be,\nIn solid, unpretentious style,\nThe style of wise antiquity.\nLofty the chambers one and all,\nSilk tapestry upon the wall,\nImperial portraits hang around\nAnd stoves of various shapes abound.\nAll this I know is out of date,\nI cannot tell the reason why,\nBut Eugene, incontestably,\nThe matter did not agitate,\nBecause he yawned at the bare view\nOf drawing-rooms or old or new.\n\nIII\n\nHe took the room wherein the old\nMan--forty years long in this wise--\nHis housekeeper was wont to scold,\nLook through the window and kill flies.\n'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan,\nTwo cupboards, table, soft divan,\nAnd not a speck of dirt descried.\nOneguine oped the cupboards wide.\nIn one he doth accounts behold,\nHere bottles stand in close array,\nThere jars of cider block the way,\nAn almanac but eight years old.\nHis uncle, busy man indeed,\nNo other book had time to read.\n\nIV\n\nAlone amid possessions great,\nEugene at first began to dream,\nIf but to lighten Time's dull rate,\nOf many an economic scheme;\nThis anchorite amid his waste\nThe ancient _barshtchina_ replaced\nBy an _obrok's_ indulgent rate:(23)\nThe peasant blessed his happy fate.\nBut this a heinous crime appeared\nUnto his neighbour, man of thrift,\nWho secretly denounced the gift,\nAnd many another slily sneered;\nAnd all with one accord agreed,\nHe was a dangerous fool indeed.\n\n[Note 23: The _barshtchina_ was the corvee, or forced labour\nof three days per week rendered previous to the emancipation\nof 1861 by the serfs to their lord.\n\nThe _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either\nin lieu of the forced labour or in consideration of being\npermitted to exercise a trade or profession elsewhere. Very\nheavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of\nskill or accomplishments, or who had amassed wealth; and\ncircumstances may be easily imagined which, under such a\nsystem, might lead to great abuses.]\n\nV\n\nAll visited him at first, of course;\nBut since to the backdoor they led\nMost usually a Cossack horse\nUpon the Don's broad pastures bred\nIf they but heard domestic loads\nCome rumbling up the neighbouring roads,\nMost by this circumstance offended\nAll overtures of friendship ended.\n\"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!\nHe's a freemason, so we think.\nAlone he doth his claret drink,\nA lady's hand doth never kiss.\n'Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_\"(24)\nThis was his social character.\n\n[Note 24: The neighbours complained of Oneguine's want of courtesy.\nHe always replied \"da\" or \"nyet,\" yes or no, instead of \"das\"\nor \"nyets\"--the final s being a contraction of \"sudar\" or\n\"sudarinia,\" i.e. sir or madam.]\n\nVI\n\nInto the district then to boot\nA new proprietor arrived,\nFrom whose analysis minute\nThe neighbourhood fresh sport derived.\nVladimir Lenski was his name,\nFrom Gottingen inspired he came,\nA worshipper of Kant, a bard,\nA young and handsome galliard.\nHe brought from mystic Germany\nThe fruits of learning and combined\nA fiery and eccentric mind,\nIdolatry of liberty,\nA wild enthusiastic tongue,\nBlack curls which to his shoulders hung.\n\nVII\n\nThe pervert world with icy chill\nHad not yet withered his young breast.\nHis heart reciprocated still\nWhen Friendship smiled or Love caressed.\nHe was a dear delightful fool--\nA nursling yet for Hope to school.\nThe riot of the world and glare\nStill sovereigns of his spirit were,\nAnd by a sweet delusion he\nWould soothe the doubtings of his soul,\nHe deemed of human life the goal\nTo be a charming mystery:\nHe racked his brains to find its clue\nAnd marvels deemed he thus should view.\n\nVIII\n\nThis he believed: a kindred spirit\nImpelled to union with his own\nLay languishing both day and night--\nWaiting his coming--his alone!\nHe deemed his friends but longed to make\nGreat sacrifices for his sake!\nThat a friend's arm in every case\nFelled a calumniator base!\nThat chosen heroes consecrate,\nFriends of the sons of every land,\nExist--that their immortal band\nShall surely, be it soon or late,\nPour on this orb a dazzling light\nAnd bless mankind with full delight.\n\nIX\n\nCompassion now or wrath inspires\nAnd now philanthropy his soul,\nAnd now his youthful heart desires\nThe path which leads to glory's goal.\nHis harp beneath that sky had rung\nWhere sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,\nAnd at the altar of their fame\nHe kindled his poetic flame.\nBut from the Muses' loftiest height\nThe gifted songster never swerved,\nBut proudly in his song preserved\nAn ever transcendental flight;\nHis transports were quite maidenly,\nCharming with grave simplicity.\n\nX\n\nHe sang of love--to love a slave.\nHis ditties were as pure and bright\nAs thoughts which gentle maidens have,\nAs a babe's slumber, or the light\nOf the moon in the tranquil skies,\nGoddess of lovers' tender sighs.\nHe sang of separation grim,\nOf what not, and of distant dim,\nOf roses to romancers dear;\nTo foreign lands he would allude,\nWhere long time he in solitude\nHad let fall many a bitter tear:\nHe sang of life's fresh colours stained\nBefore he eighteen years attained.\n\nXI\n\nSince Eugene in that solitude\nGifts such as these alone could prize,\nA scant attendance Lenski showed\nAt neighbouring hospitalities.\nHe shunned those parties boisterous;\nThe conversation tedious\nAbout the crop of hay, the wine,\nThe kennel or a kindred line,\nWas certainly not erudite\nNor sparkled with poetic fire,\nNor wit, nor did the same inspire\nA sense of social delight,\nBut still more stupid did appear\nThe gossip of their ladies fair.\n\nXII\n\nHandsome and rich, the neighbourhood\nLenski as a good match received,--\nSuch is the country custom good;\nAll mothers their sweet girls believed\nSuitable for this semi-Russian.\nHe enters: rapidly discussion\nShifts, tacks about, until they prate\nThe sorrows of a single state.\nPerchance where Dunia pours out tea\nThe young proprietor we find;\nTo Dunia then they whisper: Mind!\nAnd a guitar produced we see,\nAnd Heavens! warbled forth we hear:\n_Come to my golden palace, dear_!(25)\n\n[Note 25: From the lay of the _Russalka_, i.e. mermaid of the Dnieper.]\n\nXIII\n\nBut Lenski, having no desire\nVows matrimonial to break,\nWith our Oneguine doth aspire\nAcquaintance instantly to make.\nThey met. Earth, water, prose and verse,\nOr ice and flame, are not diverse\nIf they were similar in aught.\nAt first such contradictions wrought\nMutual repulsion and ennui,\nBut grown familiar side by side\nOn horseback every day they ride--\nInseparable soon they be.\nThus oft--this I myself confess--\nMen become friends from idleness.\n\nXIV\n\nBut even thus not now-a-days!\nIn spite of common sense we're wont\nAs cyphers others to appraise,\nOurselves as unities to count;\nAnd like Napoleons each of us\nA million bipeds reckons thus\nOne instrument for his own use--\nFeeling is silly, dangerous.\nEugene, more tolerant than this\n(Though certainly mankind he knew\nAnd usually despised it too),\nExceptionless as no rule is,\nA few of different temper deemed,\nFeeling in others much esteemed.\n\nXV\n\nWith smiling face he Lenski hears;\nThe poet's fervid conversation\nAnd judgment which unsteady veers\nAnd eye which gleams with inspiration--\nAll this was novel to Eugene.\nThe cold reply with gloomy mien\nHe oft upon his lips would curb,\nThinking: 'tis foolish to disturb\nThis evanescent boyish bliss.\nTime without me will lessons give,\nSo meantime let him joyous live\nAnd deem the world perfection is!\nForgive the fever youth inspires,\nAnd youthful madness, youthful fires.\n\nXVI\n\nThe gulf between them was so vast,\nDebate commanded ample food--\nThe laws of generations past,\nThe fruits of science, evil, good,\nThe prejudices all men have,\nThe fatal secrets of the grave,\nAnd life and fate in turn selected\nWere to analysis subjected.\nThe fervid poet would recite,\nCarried away by ecstasy,\nFragments of northern poetry,\nWhilst Eugene condescending quite,\nThough scarcely following what was said,\nAttentive listened to the lad.\n\nXVII\n\nBut more the passions occupy\nThe converse of our hermits twain,\nAnd, heaving a regretful sigh,\nAn exile from their troublous reign,\nEugene would speak regarding these.\nThrice happy who their agonies\nHath suffered but indifferent grown,\nStill happier he who ne'er hath known!\nBy absence who hath chilled his love,\nHis hate by slander, and who spends\nExistence without wife or friends,\nWhom jealous transport cannot move,\nAnd who the rent-roll of his race\nNe'er trusted to the treacherous ace.\n\nXVIII\n\nWhen, wise at length, we seek repose\nBeneath the flag of Quietude,\nWhen Passion's fire no longer glows\nAnd when her violence reviewed--\nEach gust of temper, silly word,\nSeems so unnatural and absurd:\nReduced with effort unto sense,\nWe hear with interest intense\nThe accents wild of other's woes,\nThey stir the heart as heretofore.\nSo ancient warriors, battles o'er,\nA curious interest disclose\nIn yarns of youthful troopers gay,\nLost in the hamlet far away.\n\nXIX\n\nAnd in addition youth is flame\nAnd cannot anything conceal,\nIs ever ready to proclaim\nThe love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.\nDeeming himself a veteran scarred\nIn love's campaigns Oneguine heard\nWith quite a lachrymose expression\nThe youthful poet's fond confession.\nHe with an innocence extreme\nHis inner consciousness laid bare,\nAnd Eugene soon discovered there\nThe story of his young love's dream,\nWhere plentifully feelings flow\nWhich we experienced long ago.\n\nXX\n\nAlas! he loved as in our times\nMen love no more, as only the\nMad spirit of the man who rhymes\nIs still condemned in love to be;\nOne image occupied his mind,\nConstant affection intertwined\nAnd an habitual sense of pain;\nAnd distance interposed in vain,\nNor years of separation all\nNor homage which the Muse demands\nNor beauties of far distant lands\nNor study, banquet, rout nor ball\nHis constant soul could ever tire,\nWhich glowed with virginal desire.\n\nXXI\n\nWhen but a boy he Olga loved\nUnknown as yet the aching heart,\nHe witnessed tenderly and moved\nHer girlish gaiety and sport.\nBeneath the sheltering oak tree's shade\nHe with his little maiden played,\nWhilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,\nDreamed in the future man and wife.\nAnd full of innocent delight,\nAs in a thicket's humble shade,\nBeneath her parents' eyes the maid\nGrew like a lily pure and white,\nUnseen in thick and tangled grass\nBy bee and butterfly which pass.\n\nXXII\n\n'Twas she who first within his breast\nPoetic transport did infuse,\nAnd thoughts of Olga first impressed\nA mournful temper on his Muse.\nFarewell! thou golden days of love!\n'Twas then he loved the tangled grove\nAnd solitude and calm delight,\nThe moon, the stars, and shining night--\nThe moon, the lamp of heaven above,\nTo whom we used to consecrate\nA promenade in twilight late\nWith tears which secret sufferers love--\nBut now in her effulgence pale\nA substitute for lamps we hail!\n\nXXIII\n\nObedient she had ever been\nAnd modest, cheerful as the morn,\nAs a poetic life serene,\nSweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.\nHer eyes were of cerulean blue,\nHer locks were of a golden hue,\nHer movements, voice and figure slight,\nAll about Olga--to a light\nRomance of love I pray refer,\nYou'll find her portrait there, I vouch;\nI formerly admired her much\nBut finally grew bored by her.\nBut with her elder sister I\nMust now my stanzas occupy.\n\nXXIV\n\nTattiana was her appellation.\nWe are the first who such a name\nIn pages of a love narration\nWith such a perversity proclaim.\nBut wherefore not?--'Tis pleasant, nice,\nEuphonious, though I know a spice\nIt carries of antiquity\nAnd of the attic. Honestly,\nWe must admit but little taste\nDoth in us or our names appear(26)\n(I speak not of our poems here),\nAnd education runs to waste,\nEndowing us from out her store\nWith affectation,--nothing more.\n\n[Note 26: The Russian annotator remarks: \"The most euphonious\nGreek names, e.g. Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc.,\nare used amongst us by the lower classes only.\"]\n\nXXV\n\nAnd so Tattiana was her name,\nNor by her sister's brilliancy\nNor by her beauty she became\nThe cynosure of every eye.\nShy, silent did the maid appear\nAs in the timid forest deer,\nEven beneath her parents' roof\nStood as estranged from all aloof,\nNearest and dearest knew not how\nTo fawn upon and love express;\nA child devoid of childishness\nTo romp and play she ne'er would go:\nOft staring through the window pane\nWould she in silence long remain.\n\nXXVI\n\nContemplativeness, her delight,\nE'en from her cradle's earliest dream,\nAdorned with many a vision bright\nOf rural life the sluggish stream;\nNe'er touched her fingers indolent\nThe needle nor, o'er framework bent,\nWould she the canvas tight enrich\nWith gay design and silken stitch.\nDesire to rule ye may observe\nWhen the obedient doll in sport\nAn infant maiden doth exhort\nPolite demeanour to preserve,\nGravely repeating to another\nRecent instructions of its mother.\n\nXXVII\n\nBut Tania ne'er displayed a passion\nFor dolls, e'en from her earliest years,\nAnd gossip of the town and fashion\nShe ne'er repeated unto hers.\nStrange unto her each childish game,\nBut when the winter season came\nAnd dark and drear the evenings were,\nTerrible tales she loved to hear.\nAnd when for Olga nurse arrayed\nIn the broad meadow a gay rout,\nAll the young people round about,\nAt prisoner's base she never played.\nTheir noisy laugh her soul annoyed,\nTheir giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.\n\nXXVIII\n\nShe loved upon the balcony\nTo anticipate the break of day,\nWhen on the pallid eastern sky\nThe starry beacons fade away,\nThe horizon luminous doth grow,\nMorning's forerunners, breezes blow\nAnd gradually day unfolds.\nIn winter, when Night longer holds\nA hemisphere beneath her sway,\nLonger the East inert reclines\nBeneath the moon which dimly shines,\nAnd calmly sleeps the hours away,\nAt the same hour she oped her eyes\nAnd would by candlelight arise.\n\nXXIX\n\nRomances pleased her from the first,\nHer all in all did constitute;\nIn love adventures she was versed,\nRousseau and Richardson to boot.\nNot a bad fellow was her father\nThough superannuated rather;\nIn books he saw nought to condemn\nBut, as he never opened them,\nViewed them with not a little scorn,\nAnd gave himself but little pain\nHis daughter's book to ascertain\nWhich 'neath her pillow lay till morn.\nHis wife was also mad upon\nThe works of Mr. Richardson.\n\nXXX\n\nShe was thus fond of Richardson\nNot that she had his works perused,\nOr that adoring Grandison\nThat rascal Lovelace she abused;\nBut that Princess Pauline of old,\nHer Moscow cousin, often told\nThe tale of these romantic men;\nHer husband was a bridegroom then,\nAnd she despite herself would waste\nSighs on another than her lord\nWhose qualities appeared to afford\nMore satisfaction to her taste.\nHer Grandison was in the Guard,\nA noted fop who gambled hard.\n\nXXXI\n\nLike his, her dress was always nice,\nThe height of fashion, fitting tight,\nBut contrary to her advice\nThe girl in marriage they unite.\nThen, her distraction to allay,\nThe bridegroom sage without delay\nRemoved her to his country seat,\nWhere God alone knows whom she met.\nShe struggled hard at first thus pent,\nNight separated from her spouse,\nThen became busy with the house,\nFirst reconciled and then content;\nHabit was given us in distress\nBy Heaven in lieu of happiness.\n\nXXXII\n\nHabit alleviates the grief\nInseparable from our lot;\nThis great discovery relief\nAnd consolation soon begot.\nAnd then she soon 'twixt work and leisure\nFound out the secret how at pleasure\nTo dominate her worthy lord,\nAnd harmony was soon restored.\nThe workpeople she superintended,\nMushrooms for winter salted down,\nKept the accounts, shaved many a crown,(*)\nThe bath on Saturdays attended,\nWhen angry beat her maids, I grieve,\nAnd all without her husband's leave.\n\n[Note: The serfs destined for military service used to have\na portion of their heads shaved as a distinctive mark.]\n\nXXXIII\n\nIn her friends' albums, time had been,\nWith blood instead of ink she scrawled,\nBaptized Prascovia Pauline,\nAnd in her conversation drawled.\nShe wore her corset tightly bound,\nThe Russian N with nasal sound\nShe would pronounce _a la Francaise_;\nBut soon she altered all her ways,\nCorset and album and Pauline,\nHer sentimental verses all,\nShe soon forgot, began to call\nAkulka who was once Celine,\nAnd had with waddling in the end\nHer caps and night-dresses to mend.\n\nXXXIV\n\nAs for her spouse he loved her dearly,\nIn her affairs ne'er interfered,\nEntrusted all to her sincerely,\nIn dressing-gown at meals appeared.\nExistence calmly sped along,\nAnd oft at eventide a throng\nOf friends unceremonious would\nAssemble from the neighbourhood:\nThey growl a bit--they scandalise--\nThey crack a feeble joke and smile--\nThus the time passes and meanwhile\nOlga the tea must supervise--\n'Tis time for supper, now for bed,\nAnd soon the friendly troop hath fled.\n\nXXXV\n\nThey in a peaceful life preserved\nCustoms by ages sanctified,\nStrictly the Carnival observed,\nAte Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,\nTwice in the year to fast were bound,\nOf whirligigs were very fond,\nOf Christmas carols, song and dance;\nWhen people with long countenance\nOn Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,\nThree tears they dropt with humble mein\nUpon a bunch of lovage green;\n_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;\nOn guests their servants used to wait\nBy rank as settled by the State.(27)\n\n[Note 27: The foregoing stanza requires explanation. Russian\npancakes or \"blinni\" are consumed vigorously by the lower\norders during the Carnival. At other times it is difficult\nto procure them, at any rate in the large towns.\n\nThe Russian peasants are childishly fond of whirligigs, which\nare also much in vogue during the Carnival.\n\n\"Christmas Carols\" is not an exact equivalent for the Russian\nphrase. \"Podbliudni pessni,\" are literally \"dish songs,\" or\nsongs used with dishes (of water) during the \"sviatki\" or Holy\nNights, which extend from Christmas to Twelfth Night, for\npurposes of divination. Reference will again be made to this\nsuperstitious practice, which is not confined to Russia. See Note 52.\n\n\"Song and dance,\" the well-known \"khorovod,\" in which the dance\nproceeds to vocal music.\n\n\"Lovage,\" the _Levisticum officinalis_, is a hardy plant growing\nvery far north, though an inhabitant of our own kitchen gardens.\nThe passage containing the reference to the three tears and\nTrinity Sunday was at first deemed irreligious by the Russian\ncensors, and consequently expunged.\n\n_Kvass_ is of various sorts: there is the common _kvass_ of\nfermented rye used by the peasantry, and the more expensive\n_kvass_ of the restaurants, iced and flavoured with various fruits.\n\nThe final two lines refer to the \"Tchin,\" or Russian social\nhierarchy. There are fourteen grades in the Tchin assigning\nrelative rank and precedence to the members of the various\ndepartments of the State, civil, military, naval, court,\nscientific and educational. The military and naval grades from\nthe 14th up to the 7th confer personal nobility only, whilst\nabove the 7th hereditary rank is acquired. In the remaining\ndepartments, civil or otherwise, personal nobility is only\nattained with the 9th grade, hereditary with the 4th.]\n\nXXXVI\n\nThus age approached, the common doom,\nAnd death before the husband wide\nOpened the portals of the tomb\nAnd a new diadem supplied.(28)\nJust before dinner-time he slept,\nBy neighbouring families bewept,\nBy children and by faithful wife\nWith deeper woe than others' grief.\nHe was an honest gentleman,\nAnd where at last his bones repose\nThe epitaph on marble shows:\n_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,\nServant of God and brigadier,\nEnjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.\n\n[Note 28: A play upon the word \"venetz,\" crown, which also\nsignifies a nimbus or glory, and is the symbol of marriage\nfrom the fact of two gilt crowns being held over the heads\nof the bride and bridegroom during the ceremony. The literal\nmeaning of the passage is therefore: his earthly marriage\nwas dissolved and a heavenly one was contracted.]\n\nXXXVII\n\nTo his Penates now returned,\nVladimir Lenski visited\nHis neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned\nAbove the ashes of the dead.\nThere long time sad at heart he stayed:\n\"Poor Yorick,\" mournfully he said,\n\"How often in thine arms I lay;\nHow with thy medal I would play,\nThe Medal Otchakoff conferred!(29)\nTo me he would his Olga give,\nWould whisper: shall I so long live?\"--\nAnd by a genuine sorrow stirred,\nLenski his pencil-case took out\nAnd an elegiac poem wrote.\n\n[Note 29: The fortress of Otchakoff was taken by storm on the\n18th December 1788 by a Russian army under Prince Potemkin.\nThirty thousand Turks are said to have perished during the\nassault and ensuing massacre.]\n\nXXXVIII\n\nLikewise an epitaph with tears\nHe writes upon his parents' tomb,\nAnd thus ancestral dust reveres.\nOh! on the fields of life how bloom\nHarvests of souls unceasingly\nBy Providence's dark decree!\nThey blossom, ripen and they fall\nAnd others rise ephemeral!\nThus our light race grows up and lives,\nA moment effervescing stirs,\nThen seeks ancestral sepulchres,\nThe appointed hour arrives, arrives!\nAnd our successors soon shall drive\nUs from the world wherein we live.\n\nXXXIX\n\nMeantime, drink deeply of the flow\nOf frivolous existence, friends;\nIts insignificance I know\nAnd care but little for its ends.\nTo dreams I long have closed mine eyes,\nYet sometimes banished hopes will rise\nAnd agitate my heart again;\nAnd thus it is 'twould cause me pain\nWithout the faintest trace to leave\nThis world.

Joukovski was an unblushing plagiarist. Many\neminent English poets have been laid under contribution by him,\noften without going through the form of acknowledging the\nsource of inspiration. Even the poem in question cannot be\npronounced entirely original, though its intrinsic beauty is\nunquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its origin to Burger's poem\n\"Leonora,\" which has found so many English translators. Not\ncontent with a single development of Burger's ghastly production\nthe Russian poet has directly paraphrased \"Leonora\" under its\nown title, and also written a poem \"Liudmila\" in imitation of it.\nThe principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A\nmaiden loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence\nand is vainly reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.\nProvidence at length loses patience and sends her lover's spirit,\nto all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate\nmaiden to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber\nthe unpleasant bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to\nhis own grave, from which he has recently issued to execute his\nerrand. It is a repulsive subject. \"Svetlana,\" however, is more\nagreeable than its prototype \"Leonora,\" inasmuch as the whole\ncatastrophe turns out a dream brought on by \"sorcery,\" during the\n\"sviatki\" or Holy Nights (see Canto V. st. x), and the dreamer\nawakes to hear the tinkling of her lover's sledge approaching.\n\"Svetlana\" has been translated by Sir John Bowring.]\n\nV\n\nMeantime Oneguine's apparition\nAt Larina's abode produced\nQuite a sensation; the position\nTo all good neighbours' sport conduced.\nEndless conjectures all propound\nAnd secretly their views expound.\nWhat jokes and guesses now abound,\nA beau is for Tattiana found!\nIn fact, some people were assured\nThe wedding-day had been arranged,\nBut the date subsequently changed\nTill proper rings could be procured.\nOn Lenski's matrimonial fate\nThey long ago had held debate.\n\nVI\n\nOf course Tattiana was annoyed\nBy such allusions scandalous,\nYet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed\nWith satisfaction marvellous,\nAs in her heart the thought sank home,\nI am in love, my hour hath come!\nThus in the earth the seed expands\nObedient to warm Spring's commands.\nLong time her young imagination\nBy indolence and languor fired\nThe fated nutriment desired;\nAnd long internal agitation\nHad filled her youthful breast with gloom,\nShe waited for--I don't know whom!\n\nVII\n\nThe fatal hour had come at last--\nShe oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!\nAlas! for now before her passed\nThe same warm vision constantly;\nNow all things round about repeat\nCeaselessly to the maiden sweet\nHis name: the tenderness of home\nTiresome unto her hath become\nAnd the kind-hearted servitors:\nImmersed in melancholy thought,\nShe hears of conversation nought\nAnd hated casual visitors,\nTheir coming which no man expects,\nAnd stay whose length none recollects.\n\nVIII\n\nNow with what eager interest\nShe the delicious novel reads,\nWith what avidity and zest\nShe drinks in those seductive deeds!\nAll the creations which below\nFrom happy inspiration flow,\nThe swain of Julia Wolmar,\nMalek Adel and De Linar,(31)\nWerther, rebellious martyr bold,\nAnd that unrivalled paragon,\nThe sleep-compelling Grandison,\nOur tender dreamer had enrolled\nA single being: 'twas in fine\nNo other than Oneguine mine.\n\n[Note 31: The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin's\ntime: the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous\nMadame Krudener.

Quite so. Though I dismiss\nDark, unavailing reverie,\nI just hint, in parenthesis,\nThere is no stupid calumny\nBorn of a babbler in a loft\nAnd by the world repeated oft,\nThere is no fishmarket retort\nAnd no ridiculous report,\nWhich your true friend with a sweet smile\nWhere fashionable circles meet\nA hundred times will not repeat,\nQuite inadvertently meanwhile;\nAnd yet he in your cause would strive\nAnd loves you as--a relative!\n\nXIV\n\nAhem! Ahem! My reader noble,\nAre all your relatives quite well?\nPermit me; is it worth the trouble\nFor your instruction here to tell\nWhat I by relatives conceive?\nThese are your relatives, believe:\nThose whom we ought to love, caress,\nWith spiritual tenderness;\nWhom, as the custom is of men,\nWe visit about Christmas Day,\nOr by a card our homage pay,\nThat until Christmas comes again\nThey may forget that we exist.\nAnd so--God bless them, if He list.\n\nXV\n\nIn this the love of the fair sex\nBeats that of friends and relatives:\nIn love, although its tempests vex,\nOur liberty at least survives:\nAgreed! but then the whirl of fashion,\nThe natural fickleness of passion,\nThe torrent of opinion,\nAnd the fair sex as light as down!\nBesides the hobbies of a spouse\nShould be respected throughout life\nBy every proper-minded wife,\nAnd this the faithful one allows,\nWhen in as instant she is lost,--\nSatan will jest, and at love's cost.\n\nXVI\n\nOh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?\nWhere is he who doth not deceive?\nWho words and actions will adjust\nTo standards in which we believe?\nOh! who is not calumnious?\nWho labours hard to humour us?\nTo whom are our misfortunes grief\nAnd who is not a tiresome thief?\nMy venerated reader, oh!\nCease the pursuit of shadows vain,\nSpare yourself unavailing pain\nAnd all your love on self bestow;\nA worthy object 'tis, and well\nI know there's none more amiable.\n\nXVII\n\nBut from the interview what flowed?\nAlas! It is not hard to guess.\nThe insensate fire of love still glowed\nNor discontinued to distress\nA spirit which for sorrow yearned.\nTattiana more than ever burned\nWith hopeless passion: from her bed\nSweet slumber winged its way and fled.\nHer health, life's sweetness and its bloom,\nHer smile and maidenly repose,\nAll vanished as an echo goes.\nAcross her youth a shade had come,\nAs when the tempest's veil is drawn\nAcross the smiling face of dawn.\n\nXVIII\n\nAlas! Tattiana fades away,\nGrows pale and sinks, but nothing says;\nListless is she the livelong day\nNor interest in aught betrays.\nShaking with serious air the head,\nIn whispers low the neighbours said:\n'Tis time she to the altar went!\nBut enough! Now, 'tis my intent\nThe imagination to enliven\nWith love which happiness extends;\nAgainst my inclination, friends,\nBy sympathy I have been driven.\nForgive me!

Divination, or the telling of fortunes\nby various expedients, is the favourite pastime on these\noccasions.]\n\nVIII\n\nTattiana gazed with curious eye\nOn melted wax in water poured;\nThe clue unto some mystery\nShe deemed its outline might afford.\nRings from a dish of water full\nIn order due the maidens pull;\nBut when Tattiana's hand had ta'en\nA ring she heard the ancient strain:\n_The peasants there are rich as kings,\nThey shovel silver with a spade,\nHe whom we sing to shall be made\nHappy and glorious_. But this brings\nWith sad refrain misfortune near.\nGirls the _kashourka_ much prefer.(52)\n\n[Note 52: During the \"sviatki\" it is a common custom for the girls\nto assemble around a table on which is placed a dish or basin of\nwater which contains a ring. Each in her turn extracts the ring\nfrom the basin whilst the remainder sing in chorus the \"podbliudni\npessni,\" or \"dish songs\" before mentioned. These are popularly\nsupposed to indicate the fortunes of the immediate holder of the\nring. The first-named lines foreshadow death; the latter, the\n\"kashourka,\" or \"kitten song,\" indicates approaching marriage. It\ncommences thus: \"The cat asked the kitten to sleep on the stove.\"]\n\nIX\n\nFrosty the night; the heavens shone;\nThe wondrous host of heavenly spheres\nSailed silently in unison--\nTattiana in the yard appears\nIn a half-open dressing-gown\nAnd bends her mirror on the moon,\nBut trembling on the mirror dark\nThe sad moon only could remark.\nList! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!\nThe girl on tiptoe forward bounds\nAnd her voice sweeter than the sounds\nOf clarinet or flute doth cry:\n\"What is your name?\" The boor looked dazed,\nAnd \"Agathon\" replied, amazed.(53)\n\n[Note 53: The superstition is that the name of the future husband\nmay thus be discovered.]\n\nX\n\nTattiana (nurse the project planned)\nBy night prepared for sorcery,\nAnd in the bathroom did command\nTo lay two covers secretly.\nBut sudden fear assailed Tattiana,\nAnd I, remembering Svetlana,(54)\nBecome alarmed. So never mind!\nI'm not for witchcraft now inclined.\nSo she her silken sash unlaced,\nUndressed herself and went to bed\nAnd soon Lel hovered o'er her head.(55)\nBeneath her downy pillow placed,\nA little virgin mirror peeps.\n'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.\n\n[Note 54: See Note 30.]\n\n[Note 55: Lel, in Slavonic mythology, corresponds to the Morpheus\nof the Latins. The word is evidently connected with the verb\n\"leleyat\" to fondle or soothe, likewise with our own word\n\"to lull.\"]\n\nXI\n\nA dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.\nShe dreamt she journeyed o'er a field\nAll covered up with snow in heaps,\nBy melancholy fogs concealed.\nAmid the snowdrifts which surround\nA stream, by winter's ice unbound,\nImpetuously clove its way\nWith boiling torrent dark and gray;\nTwo poles together glued by ice,\nA fragile bridge and insecure,\nSpanned the unbridled torrent o'er;\nBeside the thundering abyss\nTattiana in despair unfeigned\nRooted unto the spot remained.\n\nXII\n\nAs if against obstruction sore\nTattiana o'er the stream complained;\nTo help her to the other shore\nNo one appeared to lend a hand.\nBut suddenly a snowdrift stirs,\nAnd what from its recess appears?\nA bristly bear of monstrous size!\nHe roars, and \"Ah!\" Tattiana cries.\nHe offers her his murderous paw;\nShe nerves herself from her alarm\nAnd leans upon the monster's arm,\nWith footsteps tremulous with awe\nPasses the torrent But alack!\nBruin is marching at her back!\n\nXIII\n\nShe, to turn back her eyes afraid,\nAccelerates her hasty pace,\nBut cannot anyhow evade\nHer shaggy myrmidon in chase.\nThe bear rolls on with many a grunt:\nA forest now she sees in front\nWith fir-trees standing motionless\nIn melancholy loveliness,\nTheir branches by the snow bowed down.\nThrough aspens, limes and birches bare,\nThe shining orbs of night appear;\nThere is no path; the storm hath strewn\nBoth bush and brake, ravine and steep,\nAnd all in snow is buried deep.\n\nXIV\n\nThe wood she enters--bear behind,--\nIn snow she sinks up to the knee;\nNow a long branch itself entwined\nAround her neck, now violently\nAway her golden earrings tore;\nNow the sweet little shoes she wore,\nGrown clammy, stick fast in the snow;\nHer handkerchief she loses now;\nNo time to pick it up! afraid,\nShe hears the bear behind her press,\nNor dares the skirting of her dress\nFor shame lift up the modest maid.\nShe runs, the bear upon her trail,\nUntil her powers of running fail.\n\nXV\n\nShe sank upon the snow. But Bruin\nAdroitly seized and carried her;\nSubmissive as if in a swoon,\nShe cannot draw a breath or stir.\nHe dragged her by a forest road\nTill amid trees a hovel showed,\nBy barren snow heaped up and bound,\nA tangled wilderness around.\nBright blazed the window of the place,\nWithin resounded shriek and shout:\n\"My chum lives here,\" Bruin grunts out.\n\"Warm yourself here a little space!\"\nStraight for the entrance then he made\nAnd her upon the threshold laid.\n\nXVI\n\nRecovering, Tania gazes round;\nBear gone--she at the threshold placed;\nInside clink glasses, cries resound\nAs if it were some funeral feast.\nBut deeming all this nonsense pure,\nShe peeped through a chink of the door.\nWhat doth she see? Around the board\nSit many monstrous shapes abhorred.\nA canine face with horns thereon,\nAnother with cock's head appeared,\nHere an old witch with hirsute beard,\nThere an imperious skeleton;\nA dwarf adorned with tail, again\nA shape half cat and half a crane.\n\nXVII\n\nYet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,\nA crab upon a spider rides,\nPerched on a goose's neck a skull\nIn scarlet cap revolving glides.\nA windmill too a jig performs\nAnd wildly waves its arms and storms;\nBarking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,\nThe speech of man and tramp of horse.\nBut wide Tattiana oped her eyes\nWhen in that company she saw\nHim who inspired both love and awe,\nThe hero we immortalize.\nOneguine sat the table by\nAnd viewed the door with cunning eye.\n\nXVIII\n\nAll bustle when he makes a sign:\nHe drinks, all drink and loudly call;\nHe smiles, in laughter all combine;\nHe knits his brows--'tis silent all.\nHe there is master--that is plain;\nTattiana courage doth regain\nAnd grown more curious by far\nJust placed the entrance door ajar.\nThe wind rose instantly, blew out\nThe fire of the nocturnal lights;\nA trouble fell upon the sprites;\nOneguine lightning glances shot;\nFurious he from the table rose;\nAll arise. To the door he goes.\n\nXIX\n\nTerror assails her. Hastily\nTattiana would attempt to fly,\nShe cannot--then impatiently\nShe strains her throat to force a cry--\nShe cannot--Eugene oped the door\nAnd the young girl appeared before\nThose hellish phantoms. Peals arise\nOf frantic laughter, and all eyes\nAnd hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,\nTails which a bushy tuft adorns,\nWhiskers and bloody tongues and horns,\nSharp rows of tushes, bony claws,\nAre turned upon her. All combine\nIn one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!\n\nXX\n\n\"Mine!\" cried Eugene with savage tone.\nThe troop of apparitions fled,\nAnd in the frosty night alone\nRemained with him the youthful maid.\nWith tranquil air Oneguine leads\nTattiana to a corner, bids\nHer on a shaky bench sit down;\nHis head sinks slowly, rests upon\nHer shoulder--Olga swiftly came--\nAnd Lenski followed--a light broke--\nHis fist Oneguine fiercely shook\nAnd gazed around with eyes of flame;\nThe unbidden guests he roughly chides--\nTattiana motionless abides.\n\nXXI\n\nThe strife grew furious and Eugene\nGrasped a long knife and instantly\nStruck Lenski dead--across the scene\nDark shadows thicken--a dread cry\nWas uttered, and the cabin shook--\nTattiana terrified awoke.\nShe gazed around her--it was day.\nLo! through the frozen windows play\nAurora's ruddy rays of light--\nThe door flew open--Olga came,\nMore blooming than the Boreal flame\nAnd swifter than the swallow's flight.\n\"Come,\" she cried, \"sister, tell me e'en\nWhom you in slumber may have seen.\"\n\nXXII\n\nBut she, her sister never heeding,\nWith book in hand reclined in bed,\nPage after page continued reading,\nBut no reply unto her made.\nAlthough her book did not contain\nThe bard's enthusiastic strain,\nNor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,\nYet neither Virgil nor Racine\nNor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,\nNor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,\nEver absorbed a maid so much:\nIts name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,\nThe chief of the Chaldean wise,\nWho dreams expound and prophecies.\n\nXXIII\n\nBrought by a pedlar vagabond\nUnto their solitude one day,\nThis monument of thought profound\nTattiana purchased with a stray\nTome of \"Malvina,\" and but three(56)\nAnd a half rubles down gave she;\nAlso, to equalise the scales,\nShe got a book of nursery tales,\nA grammar, likewise Petriads two,\nMarmontel also, tome the third;\nTattiana every day conferred\nWith Martin Zadeka. In woe\nShe consolation thence obtained--\nInseparable they remained.\n\n[Note 56: \"Malvina,\" a romance by Madame Cottin.]\n\nXXIV\n\nThe dream left terror in its train.\nNot knowing its interpretation,\nTania the meaning would obtain\nOf such a dread hallucination.\nTattiana to the index flies\nAnd alphabetically tries\nThe words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,\nRaven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,\nEt cetera_; but nothing showed\nHer Martin Zadeka in aid,\nThough the foul vision promise made\nOf a most mournful episode,\nAnd many a day thereafter laid\nA load of care upon the maid.\n\nXXV\n\n\"But lo! forth from the valleys dun\nWith purple hand Aurora leads,\nSwift following in her wake, the sun,\"(57)\nAnd a grand festival proceeds.\nThe Larinas were since sunrise\nO'erwhelmed with guests; by families\nThe neighbours come, in sledge approach,\nBritzka, kibitka, or in coach.\nCrush and confusion in the hall,\nLatest arrivals' salutations,\nBarking, young ladies' osculations,\nShouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,\nBows and the scrape of many feet,\nNurses who scream and babes who bleat.\n\n[Note 57: The above three lines are a parody on the turgid\nstyle of Lomonossoff, a literary man of the second Catherine's\nera.]\n\nXXVI\n\nBringing his partner corpulent\nFat Poustiakoff drove to the door;\nGvozdine, a landlord excellent,\nOppressor of the wretched poor;\nAnd the Skatenines, aged pair,\nWith all their progeny were there,\nWho from two years to thirty tell;\nPetoushkoff, the provincial swell;\nBouyanoff too, my cousin, wore(58)\nHis wadded coat and cap with peak\n(Surely you know him as I speak);\nAnd Flianoff, pensioned councillor,\nRogue and extortioner of yore,\nNow buffoon, glutton, and a bore.\n\n[Note 58: Pushkin calls Bouyanoff his cousin because he is a\ncharacter in the \"Dangerous Neighbour,\" a poem by Vassili\nPushkin, the poet's uncle.]\n\nXXVII\n\nThe family of Kharlikoff,\nCame with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,\nWho arrived lately from Tamboff,\nIn spectacles and chestnut wig.\nLike a true Frenchman, couplets wrought\nIn Tania's praise in pouch he brought,\nKnown unto children perfectly:\n_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.\nAmong some ancient ballads thrust,\nHe found them in an almanac,\nAnd the sagacious Triquet back\nTo light had brought them from their dust,\nWhilst he \"belle Nina\" had the face\nBy \"belle Tattiana\" to replace.\n\nXXVIII\n\nLo! from the nearest barrack came,\nOf old maids the divinity,\nAnd comfort of each country dame,\nThe captain of a company.\nHe enters. Ah! good news to-day!\nThe military band will play.\nThe colonel sent it. Oh! delight!\nSo there will be a dance to-night.\nGirls in anticipation skip!\nBut dinner-time comes. Two and two\nThey hand in hand to table go.\nThe maids beside Tattiana keep--\nMen opposite. The cross they sign\nAnd chattering loud sit down to dine.\n\nXXIX\n\nCeased for a space all chattering.\nJaws are at work. On every side\nPlates, knives and forks are clattering\nAnd ringing wine-glasses are plied.\nBut by degrees the crowd begin\nTo raise a clamour and a din:\nThey laugh, they argue, and they bawl,\nThey shout and no one lists at all.\nThe doors swing open: Lenski makes\nHis entrance with Oneguine. \"Ah!\nAt last the author!\" cries Mamma.\nThe guests make room; aside each takes\nHis chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;\nThe friends are called and quickly placed.\n\nXXX\n\nRight opposite Tattiana placed,\nShe, than the morning moon more pale,\nMore timid than a doe long chased,\nLifts not her eyes which swimming fail.\nAnew the flames of passion start\nWithin her; she is sick at heart;\nThe two friends' compliments she hears\nNot, and a flood of bitter tears\nWith effort she restrains. Well nigh\nThe poor girl fell into a faint,\nBut strength of mind and self-restraint\nPrevailed at last. She in reply\nSaid something in an undertone\nAnd at the table sat her down.\n\nXXXI\n\nTo tragedy, the fainting fit,\nAnd female tears hysterical,\nOneguine could not now submit,\nFor long he had endured them all.\nOur misanthrope was full of ire,\nAt a great feast against desire,\nAnd marking Tania's agitation,\nCast down his eyes in trepidation\nAnd sulked in silent indignation;\nSwearing how Lenski he would rile,\nAvenge himself in proper style.\nTriumphant by anticipation,\nCaricatures he now designed\nOf all the guests within his mind.\n\nXXXII\n\nCertainly not Eugene alone\nTattiana's trouble might have spied,\nBut that the eyes of every one\nBy a rich pie were occupied--\nUnhappily too salt by far;\nAnd that a bottle sealed with tar\nAppeared, Don's effervescing boast,(59)\nBetween the blanc-mange and the roast;\nBehind, of glasses an array,\nTall, slender, like thy form designed,\nZizi, thou mirror of my mind,\nFair object of my guileless lay,\nSeductive cup of love, whose flow\nMade me so tipsy long ago!\n\n[Note 59: The _Donskoe Champanskoe_ is a species of sparkling wine\nmanufactured in the vicinity of the river Don.]\n\nXXXIII\n\nFrom the moist cork the bottle freed\nWith loud explosion, the bright wine\nHissed forth. With serious air indeed,\nLong tortured by his lay divine,\nTriquet arose, and for the bard\nThe company deep silence guard.\nTania well nigh expired when he\nTurned to her and discordantly\nIntoned it, manuscript in hand.\nVoices and hands applaud, and she\nMust bow in common courtesy;\nThe poet, modest though so grand,\nDrank to her health in the first place,\nThen handed her the song with grace.\n\nXXXIV\n\nCongratulations, toasts resound,\nTattiana thanks to all returned,\nBut, when Oneguine's turn came round,\nThe maiden's weary eye which yearned,\nHer agitation and distress\nAroused in him some tenderness.\nHe bowed to her nor silence broke,\nBut somehow there shone in his look\nThe witching light of sympathy;\nI know not if his heart felt pain\nOr if he meant to flirt again,\nFrom habit or maliciously,\nBut kindness from his eye had beamed\nAnd to revive Tattiana seemed.\n\nXXXV\n\nThe chairs are thrust back with a roar,\nThe crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,\nAs bees who leave their dainty store\nAnd seek in buzzing swarms the meads.\nContented and with victuals stored,\nNeighbour by neighbour sat and snored,\nMatrons unto the fireplace go,\nMaids in the corner whisper low;\nBehold! green tables are brought forth,\nAnd testy gamesters do engage\nIn boston and the game of age,\nOmbre, and whist all others worth:\nA strong resemblance these possess--\nAll sons of mental weariness.\n\nXXXVI\n\nEight rubbers were already played,\nEight times the heroes of the fight\nChange of position had essayed,\nWhen tea was brought. 'Tis my delight\nTime to denote by dinner, tea,\nAnd supper. In the country we\nCan count the time without much fuss--\nThe stomach doth admonish us.\nAnd, by the way, I here assert\nThat for that matter in my verse\nAs many dinners I rehearse,\nAs oft to meat and drink advert,\nAs thou, great Homer, didst of yore,\nWhom thirty centuries adore.\n\nXXXVII\n\nI will with thy divinity\nContend with knife and fork and platter,\nBut grant with magnanimity\nI'm beaten in another matter;\nThy heroes, sanguinary wights,\nAlso thy rough-and-tumble fights,\nThy Venus and thy Jupiter,\nMore advantageously appear\nThan cold Oneguine's oddities,\nThe aspect of a landscape drear.\nOr e'en Istomina, my dear,\nAnd fashion's gay frivolities;\nBut my Tattiana, on my soul,\nIs sweeter than thy Helen foul.\n\nXXXVIII\n\nNo one the contrary will urge,\nThough for his Helen Menelaus\nAgain a century should scourge\nUs, and like Trojan warriors slay us;\nThough around honoured Priam's throne\nTroy's sages should in concert own\nOnce more, when she appeared in sight,\nParis and Menelaus right.\nBut as to fighting--'twill appear!\nFor patience, reader, I must plead!\nA little farther please to read\nAnd be not in advance severe.\nThere'll be a fight. I do not lie.\nMy word of honour given have I.\n\nXXXIX\n\nThe tea, as I remarked, appeared,\nBut scarce had maids their saucers ta'en\nWhen in the grand saloon was heard\nOf bassoons and of flutes the strain.\nHis soul by crash of music fired,\nHis tea with rum no more desired,\nThe Paris of those country parts\nTo Olga Petoushkova darts:\nTo Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,\nA marriageable maid matured,\nThe poet from Tamboff secured,\nBouyanoff whisked off Poustiakova.\nAll to the grand saloon are gone--\nThe ball in all its splendour shone.\n\nXL\n\nI tried when I began this tale,\n(See the first canto if ye will),\nA ball in Peter's capital,\nTo sketch ye in Albano's style.(60)\nBut by fantastic dreams distraught,\nMy memory wandered wide and sought\nThe feet of my dear lady friends.\nO feet, where'er your path extends\nI long enough deceived have erred.\nThe perfidies I recollect\nShould make me much more circumspect,\nReform me both in deed and word,\nAnd this fifth canto ought to be\nFrom such digressions wholly free.\n\n[Note 60: Francesco Albano, a celebrated painter, styled the \"Anacreon\nof Painting,\" was born at Bologna 1578, and died in the year 1666.]\n\nXLI\n\nThe whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,\nUndeviating and insane\nAs giddy youth's hilarity--\nPair after pair the race sustain.\nThe moment for revenge, meanwhile,\nEspying, Eugene with a smile\nApproaches Olga and the pair\nAmid the company career.\nSoon the maid on a chair he seats,\nBegins to talk of this and that,\nBut when two minutes she had sat,\nAgain the giddy waltz repeats.\nAll are amazed; but Lenski he\nScarce credits what his eyes can see.\n\nXLII\n\nHark! the mazurka. In times past,\nWhen the mazurka used to peal,\nAll rattled in the ball-room vast,\nThe parquet cracked beneath the heel,\nAnd jolting jarred the window-frames.\n'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames\nWe glide along a floor of wax.\nHowever, the mazurka lacks\nNought of its charms original\nIn country towns, where still it keeps\nIts stamping, capers and high leaps.\nFashion is there immutable,\nWho tyrannizes us with ease,\nOf modern Russians the disease.\n\nXLIII\n\nBouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine,\nUnto the hero of this lay\nOlga and Tania led. Malign,\nOneguine Olga bore away.\nGliding in negligent career,\nHe bending whispered in her ear\nSome madrigal not worth a rush,\nAnd pressed her hand--the crimson blush\nUpon her cheek by adulation\nGrew brighter still. But Lenski hath\nSeen all, beside himself with wrath,\nAnd hot with jealous indignation,\nTill the mazurka's close he stays,\nHer hand for the cotillon prays.\n\nXLIV\n\nShe fears she cannot.--Cannot? Why?--\nShe promised Eugene, or she would\nWith great delight.--O God on high!\nHeard he the truth? And thus she could--\nAnd can it be? But late a child\nAnd now a fickle flirt and wild,\nCunning already to display\nAnd well-instructed to betray!\nLenski the stroke could not sustain,\nAt womankind he growled a curse,\nDeparted, ordered out his horse\nAnd galloped home. But pistols twain,\nA pair of bullets--nought beside--\nHis fate shall presently decide.\n\n\nEND OF CANTO THE FIFTH\n\n\n\nCANTO THE SIXTH\n\nThe Duel\n\n'La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi,\nNasce una gente a cui 'l morir non duole.'\n                                   Petrarch\n\nCanto The Sixth\n\n[Mikhailovskoe, 1826: the two final stanzas were, however,\nwritten at Moscow.]\n\nI\n\nHaving remarked Vladimir's flight,\nOneguine, bored to death again,\nBy Olga stood, dejected quite\nAnd satisfied with vengeance ta'en.\nOlga began to long likewise\nFor Lenski, sought him with her eyes,\nAnd endless the cotillon seemed\nAs if some troubled dream she dreamed.\n'Tis done. To supper they proceed.\nBedding is laid out and to all\nAssigned a lodging, from the hall(61)\nUp to the attic, and all need\nTranquil repose. Eugene alone\nTo pass the night at home hath gone.\n\n[Note 61: Hospitality is a national virtue of the Russians. On\nfestal occasions in the country the whole party is usually\naccommodated for the night, or indeed for as many nights\nas desired, within the house of the entertainer. This of\ncourse is rendered necessary by the great distances which\nseparate the residences of the gentry. Still, the alacrity with\nwhich a Russian hostess will turn her house topsy-turvy for\nthe accommodation of forty or fifty guests would somewhat\nastonish the mistress of a modern Belgravian mansion.]\n\nII\n\nAll slumber. In the drawing-room\nLoud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff\nWith better half as cumbersome;\nGvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff\nAnd Flianoff, somewhat indisposed,\nOn chairs in the saloon reposed,\nWhilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet\nIn jersey and in nightcap lay.\nIn Olga's and Tattiana's rooms\nLay all the girls by sleep embraced,\nExcept one by the window placed\nWhom pale Diana's ray illumes--\nMy poor Tattiana cannot sleep\nBut stares into the darkness deep.\n\nIII\n\nHis visit she had not awaited,\nHis momentary loving glance\nHer inmost soul had penetrated,\nAnd his strange conduct at the dance\nWith Olga; nor of this appeared\nAn explanation: she was scared,\nAlarmed by jealous agonies:\nA hand of ice appeared to seize(62)\nHer heart: it seemed a darksome pit\nBeneath her roaring opened wide:\n\"I shall expire,\" Tattiana cried,\n\"But death from him will be delight.\nI murmur not! Why mournfulness?\nHe _cannot_ give me happiness.\"\n\n[Note 62: There must be a peculiar appropriateness in this expression\nas descriptive of the sensation of extreme cold. Mr. Wallace\nmakes use of an identical phrase in describing an occasion\nwhen he was frostbitten whilst sledging in Russia. He says\n(vol. i. p. 33): \"My fur cloak flew open, the cold seemed to\n_grasp me in the region of the heart_, and I fell insensible.\"]\n\nIV\n\nHaste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!\nA new acquaintance we must scan.\nThere dwells five versts from Krasnogory,\nVladimir's property, a man\nWho thrives this moment as I write,\nA philosophic anchorite:\nZaretski, once a bully bold,\nA gambling troop when he controlled,\nChief rascal, pot-house president,\nNow of a family the head,\nSimple and kindly and unwed,\nTrue friend, landlord benevolent,\nYea! and a man of honour, lo!\nHow perfect doth our epoch grow!\n\nV\n\nTime was the flattering voice of fame,\nHis ruffian bravery adored,\nAnd true, his pistol's faultless aim\nAn ace at fifteen paces bored.\nBut I must add to what I write\nThat, tipsy once in actual fight,\nHe from his Kalmuck horse did leap\nIn mud and mire to wallow deep,\nDrunk as a fly; and thus the French\nA valuable hostage gained,\nA modern Regulus unchained,\nWho to surrender did not blench\nThat every morn at Verrey's cost\nThree flasks of wine he might exhaust.\n\nVI\n\nTime was, his raillery was gay,\nHe loved the simpleton to mock,\nTo make wise men the idiot play\nOpenly or 'neath decent cloak.\nYet sometimes this or that deceit\nEncountered punishment complete,\nAnd sometimes into snares as well\nHimself just like a greenhorn fell.\nHe could in disputation shine\nWith pungent or obtuse retort,\nAt times to silence would resort,\nAt times talk nonsense with design;\nQuarrels among young friends he bred\nAnd to the field of honour led;\n\nVII\n\nOr reconciled them, it may be,\nAnd all the three to breakfast went;\nThen he'd malign them secretly\nWith jest and gossip gaily blent.\n_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery\n(Like love, another sort of knavery!)\nDiminishes as years decline.\nBut, as I said, Zaretski mine\nBeneath acacias, cherry-trees,\nFrom storms protection having sought,\nLived as a really wise man ought,\nLike Horace, planted cabbages,\nBoth ducks and geese in plenty bred\nAnd lessons to his children read.\n\nVIII\n\nHe was no fool, and Eugene mine,\nTo friendship making no pretence,\nAdmired his judgment, which was fine,\nPervaded with much common sense.\nHe usually was glad to see\nThe man and liked his company,\nSo, when he came next day to call,\nWas not surprised thereby at all.\nBut, after mutual compliments,\nZaretski with a knowing grin,\nEre conversation could begin,\nThe epistle from the bard presents.\nOneguine to the window went\nAnd scanned in silence its content.\n\nIX\n\nIt was a cheery, generous\nCartel, or challenge to a fight,\nWhereto in language courteous\nLenski his comrade did invite.\nOneguine, by first impulse moved,\nTurned and replied as it behoved,\nCurtly announcing for the fray\nThat he was \"ready any day.\"\nZaretski rose, nor would explain,\nHe cared no longer there to stay,\nHad much to do at home that day,\nAnd so departed. But Eugene,\nThe matter by his conscience tried,\nWas with himself dissatisfied.\n\nX\n\nIn fact, the subject analysed,\nWithin that secret court discussed,\nIn much his conduct stigmatized;\nFor, from the outset, 'twas unjust\nTo jest as he had done last eve,\nA timid, shrinking love to grieve.\nAnd ought he not to disregard\nThe poet's madness? for 'tis hard\nAt eighteen not to play the fool!\nSincerely loving him, Eugene\nAssuredly should not have been\nConventionality's dull tool--\nNot a mere hot, pugnacious boy,\nBut man of sense and probity.\n\nXI\n\nHe might his motives have narrated,\nNot bristled up like a wild beast,\nHe ought to have conciliated\nThat youthful heart--\"But, now at least,\nThe opportunity is flown.\nBesides, a duellist well-known\nHath mixed himself in the affair,\nMalicious and a slanderer.\nUndoubtedly, disdain alone\nShould recompense his idle jeers,\nBut fools--their calumnies and sneers\"--\nBehold! the world's opinion!(63)\nOur idol, Honour's motive force,\nRound which revolves the universe.\n\n[Note 63: A line of Griboyedoff's.

He\nhowever returned to the Kremlin on the 19th September. The Palace\nitself is placed in the midst of extensive grounds just outside\nthe city, on the road to Tver, i.e. to the northwest. It is\nperhaps worthy of remark, as one amongst numerous circumstances\nproving how extensively the poet interwove his own life-experiences\nwith the plot of this poem, that it was by this road that he\nhimself must have been in the habit of approaching Moscow from his\nfavourite country residence of Mikhailovskoe, in the province of\nPskoff.]\n\nXXXVI\n\nAdieu, thou witness of our glory,\nPetrovski Palace; come, astir!\nDrive on! the city barriers hoary\nAppear; along the road of Tver\nThe coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,\nPast women, sentry-boxes, rolls,\nPast palaces and nunneries,\nLamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,\nBokharians, peasants, beds of greens,\nBoulevards, belfries, milliners,\nHuts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers\nAnd fashionable magazines,\nBalconies, lion's heads on doors,\nJackdaws on every spire--in scores.(75)\n\n[Note 75: The first line refers to the prevailing shape of the\ncast-iron handles which adorn the _porte cocheres_.

It must be--no--\nHow! from the waste of steppes unseen,\"--\nAnd the eternal lorgnette through\nFrequent and rapid doth his glance\nSeek the forgotten countenance\nFamiliar to him long ago.\n\"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know\nThe lady in the crimson cap\nWho with the Spanish envoy speaks?\"--\nThe prince's eye Oneguine seeks:\n\"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!\nBut stop! I will present thee, if\nYou choose.\"--\"But who is she?\"--\"My wife.\"\n\nXVIII\n\n\"So thou art wed! I did not know.\nLong ago?\"--\"'Tis the second year.\"\n\"To--?\"--\"Larina.\"--\"Tattiana?\"--\"So.\nAnd dost thou know her?\"--\"We live near.\"\n\"Then come with me.\" The prince proceeds,\nHis wife approaches, with him leads\nHis relative and friend as well.\nThe lady's glance upon him fell--\nAnd though her soul might be confused,\nAnd vehemently though amazed\nShe on the apparition gazed,\nNo signs of trouble her accused,\nA mien unaltered she preserved,\nHer bow was easy, unreserved.\n\nXIX\n\nAh no! no faintness her attacked\nNor sudden turned she red or white,\nHer brow she did not e'en contract\nNor yet her lip compressed did bite.\nThough he surveyed her at his ease,\nNot the least trace Oneguine sees\nOf the Tattiana of times fled.\nHe conversation would have led--\nBut could not. Then she questioned him:--\n\"Had he been long here, and where from?\nStraight from their province had he come?\"--\nCast upwards then her eyeballs dim\nUnto her husband, went away--\nTransfixed Oneguine mine doth stay.\n\nXX\n\nIs this the same Tattiana, say,\nBefore whom once in solitude,\nIn the beginning of this lay,\nDeep in the distant province rude,\nImpelled by zeal for moral worth,\nHe salutary rules poured forth?\nThe maid whose note he still possessed\nWherein the heart its vows expressed,\nWhere all upon the surface lies,--\nThat girl--but he must dreaming be--\nThat girl whom once on a time he\nCould in a humble sphere despise,\nCan she have been a moment gone\nThus haughty, careless in her tone?\n\nXXI\n\nHe quits the fashionable throng\nAnd meditative homeward goes,\nVisions, now sad, now grateful, long\nDo agitate his late repose.\nHe wakes--they with a letter come--\nThe Princess N. will be at home\nOn such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!\nOh! I accept. And instantly\nHe a polite reply doth scrawl.\nWhat hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?\nIn the recesses what hath stirred\nOf a heart cold and cynical?\nVexation? Vanity? or strove\nAgain the plague of boyhood--love?\n\nXXII\n\nThe hours once more Oneguine counts,\nImpatient waits the close of day,\nBut ten strikes and his sledge he mounts\nAnd gallops to her house away.\nTrembling he seeks the young princess--\nTattiana finds in loneliness.\nTogether moments one or two\nThey sat, but conversation's flow\nDeserted Eugene. He, distraught,\nSits by her gloomily, desponds,\nScarce to her questions he responds,\nFull of exasperating thought.\nHe fixedly upon her stares--\nShe calm and unconcerned appears.\n\nXXIII\n\nThe husband comes and interferes\nWith this unpleasant _tete-a-tete_,\nWith Eugene pranks of former years\nAnd jests doth recapitulate.\nThey talked and laughed. The guests arrived.\nThe conversation was revived\nBy the coarse wit of worldly hate;\nBut round the hostess scintillate\nLight sallies without coxcombry,\nAwhile sound conversation seems\nTo banish far unworthy themes\nAnd platitudes and pedantry,\nAnd never was the ear affright\nBy liberties or loose or light.\n\nXXIV\n\nAnd yet the city's flower was there,\nNoblesse and models of the mode,\nFaces which we meet everywhere\nAnd necessary fools allowed.\nBehold the dames who once were fine\nWith roses, caps and looks malign;\nSome marriageable maids behold,\nBlank, unapproachable and cold.\nLo, the ambassador who speaks\nEconomy political,\nAnd with gray hair ambrosial\nThe old man who has had his freaks,\nRenowned for his acumen, wit,\nBut now ridiculous a bit.\n\nXXV\n\nBehold Sabouroff, whom the age\nFor baseness of the spirit scorns,\nSaint Priest, who every album's page\nWith blunted pencil-point adorns.\nAnother tribune of the ball\nHung like a print against the wall,\nPink as Palm Sunday cherubim,(84)\nMotionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.\nThe traveller, bird of passage he,\nStiff, overstarched and insolent,\nAwakens secret merriment\nBy his embarrassed dignity--\nMute glances interchanged aside\nMeet punishment for him provide.\n\n[Note 84: On Palm Sunday the Russians carry branches, or used to\ndo so. These branches were adorned with little painted pictures\nof cherubs with the ruddy complexions of tradition. Hence the\ncomparison.]\n\nXXVI\n\nBut my Oneguine the whole eve\nWithin his mind Tattiana bore,\nNot the young timid maid, believe,\nEnamoured, simple-minded, poor,\nBut the indifferent princess,\nDivinity without access\nOf the imperial Neva's shore.\nO Men, how very like ye are\nTo Eve the universal mother,\nPossession hath no power to please,\nThe serpent to unlawful trees\nAye bids ye in some way or other--\nUnless forbidden fruit we eat,\nOur paradise is no more sweet.\n\nXXVII\n\nAh! how Tattiana was transformed,\nHow thoroughly her part she took!\nHow soon to habits she conformed\nWhich crushing dignity must brook!\nWho would the maiden innocent\nIn the unmoved, magnificent\nAutocrat of the drawing-room seek?\nAnd he had made her heart beat quick!\n'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,\nWhilst Morpheus his approach delays,\nShe mourned and to the moon would raise\nThe languid eye of love-sick maids,\nDreaming perchance in weal or woe\nTo end with him her path below.\n\nXXVIII\n\nTo Love all ages lowly bend,\nBut the young unpolluted heart\nHis gusts should fertilize, amend,\nAs vernal storms the fields athwart.\nYouth freshens beneath Passion's showers,\nDevelops and matures its powers,\nAnd thus in season the rich field\nGay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.\nBut at a later, sterile age,\nThe solstice of our earthly years,\nMournful Love's deadly trace appears\nAs storms which in chill autumn rage\nAnd leave a marsh the fertile ground\nAnd devastate the woods around.\n\nXXIX\n\nThere was no doubt! Eugene, alas!\nTattiana loved as when a lad,\nBoth day and night he now must pass\nIn love-lorn meditation sad.\nCareless of every social rule,\nThe crystals of her vestibule\nHe daily in his drives drew near\nAnd like a shadow haunted her.\nEnraptured was he if allowed\nTo swathe her shoulders in the furs,\nIf his hot hand encountered hers,\nOr he dispersed the motley crowd\nOf lackeys in her pathway grouped,\nOr to pick up her kerchief stooped.\n\nXXX\n\nShe seemed of him oblivious,\nDespite the anguish of his breast,\nReceived him freely at her house,\nAt times three words to him addressed\nIn company, or simply bowed,\nOr recognized not in the crowd.\nNo coquetry was there, I vouch--\nSociety endures not such!\nOneguine's cheek grew ashy pale,\nEither she saw not or ignored;\nOneguine wasted; on my word,\nAlready he grew phthisical.\nAll to the doctors Eugene send,\nAnd they the waters recommend.\n\nXXXI\n\nHe went not--sooner was prepared\nTo write his forefathers to warn\nOf his approach; but nothing cared\nTattiana--thus the sex is born.--\nHe obstinately will remain,\nStill hopes, endeavours, though in vain.\nSickness more courage doth command\nThan health, so with a trembling hand\nA love epistle he doth scrawl.\nThough correspondence as a rule\nHe used to hate--and was no fool--\nYet suffering emotional\nHad rendered him an invalid;\nBut word for word his letter read.\n\nOneguine's Letter to Tattiana\n\nAll is foreseen. My secret drear\nWill sound an insult in your ear.\nWhat acrimonious scorn I trace\nDepicted on your haughty face!\nWhat do I ask? What cause assigned\nThat I to you reveal my mind?\nTo what malicious merriment,\nIt may be, I yield nutriment!\n\nMeeting you in times past by chance,\nWarmth I imagined in your glance,\nBut, knowing not the actual truth,\nRestrained the impulses of youth;\nAlso my wretched liberty\nI would not part with finally;\nThis separated us as well--\nLenski, unhappy victim, fell,\nFrom everything the heart held dear\nI then resolved my heart to tear;\nUnknown to all, without a tie,\nI thought--retirement, liberty,\nWill happiness replace. My God!\nHow I have erred and felt the rod!\n\nNo, ever to behold your face,\nTo follow you in every place,\nYour smiling lips, your beaming eyes,\nTo watch with lovers' ecstasies,\nLong listen, comprehend the whole\nOf your perfections in my soul,\nBefore you agonized to die--\nThis, this were true felicity!\n\nBut such is not for me. I brood\nDaily of love in solitude.\nMy days of life approach their end,\nYet I in idleness expend\nThe remnant destiny concedes,\nAnd thus each stubbornly proceeds.\nI feel, allotted is my span;\nBut, that life longer may remain,\nAt morn I must assuredly\nKnow that thy face that day I see.\n\nI tremble lest my humble prayer\nYou with stern countenance declare\nThe artifice of villany--\nI hear your harsh, reproachful cry.\nIf ye but knew how dreadful 'tis\nTo bear love's parching agonies--\nTo burn, yet reason keep awake\nThe fever of the blood to slake--\nA passionate desire to bend\nAnd, sobbing at your feet, to blend\nEntreaties, woes and prayers, confess\nAll that the heart would fain express--\nYet with a feigned frigidity\nTo arm the tongue and e'en the eye,\nTo be in conversation clear\nAnd happy unto you appear.\n\nSo be it! But internal strife\nI cannot longer wage concealed.\nThe die is cast! Thine is my life!\nInto thy hands my fate I yield!\n\nXXXII\n\nNo answer! He another sent.\nEpistle second, note the third,\nRemained unnoticed. Once he went\nTo an assembly--she appeared\nJust as he entered. How severe!\nShe will not see, she will not hear.\nAlas! she is as hard, behold,\nAnd frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.\nOh, how her lips compressed restrain\nThe indignation of her heart!\nA sidelong look doth Eugene dart:\nWhere, where, remorse, compassion, pain?\nWhere, where, the trace of tears? None, none!\nUpon her brow sits wrath alone--\n\nXXXIII\n\nAnd it may be a secret dread\nLest the world or her lord divine\nA certain little escapade\nWell known unto Oneguine mine.\n'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee\nCursing his own stupidity,\nAnd brooding o'er the ills he bore,\nSociety renounced once more.\nThen in the silent cabinet\nHe in imagination saw\nThe time when Melancholy's claw\n'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,\nCaught him and by the collar took\nAnd shut him in a lonely nook.\n\nXXXIV\n\nHe read as vainly as before,\nperusing Gibbon and Rousseau,\nManzoni, Herder and Chamfort,(85)\nMadame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:\nHe read the unbelieving Bayle,\nAlso the works of Fontenelle,\nSome Russian authors he perused--\nNought in the universe refused:\nNor almanacs nor newspapers,\nWhich lessons unto us repeat,\nWherein I castigation get;\nAnd where a madrigal occurs\nWrit in my honour now and then--\n_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!\n\n[Note 85: Owing to the unstable nature of fame the names of some\nof the above literary worthies necessitate reference at this\nperiod in the nineteenth century.\n\nJohann Gottfried von Herder, b. 1744, d. 1803, a German\nphilosopher, philanthropist and author, was the personal friend\nof Goethe and held the poet of court chaplain at Weimar.

He exercised a\nconsiderable influence over certain of its leaders, notably\nMirabeau and Sieyes. He is said to have originated the title of\nthe celebrated tract from the pen of the latter. \"What is the\nTiers Etat? Nothing. What ought it to be?

It is characterized by a feverish\nthirst for encyclopaedic knowledge without a corresponding power\nof assimilation.]\n\nXXXV\n\nBut what results? His eyes peruse\nBut thoughts meander far away--\nIdeas, desires and woes confuse\nHis intellect in close array.\nHis eyes, the printed lines betwixt,\nOn lines invisible are fixt;\n'Twas these he read and these alone\nHis spirit was intent upon.\nThey were the wonderful traditions\nOf kindly, dim antiquity,\nDreams with no continuity,\nProphecies, threats and apparitions,\nThe lively trash of stories long\nOr letters of a maiden young.\n\nXXXVI\n\nAnd by degrees upon him grew\nA lethargy of sense, a trance,\nAnd soon imagination threw\nBefore him her wild game of chance.\nAnd now upon the snow in thaw\nA young man motionless he saw,\nAs one who bivouacs afield,\nAnd heard a voice cry--_Why! He's killed_!--\nAnd now he views forgotten foes,\nPoltroons and men of slanderous tongue,\nBevies of treacherous maidens young;\nOf thankless friends the circle rose,\nA mansion--by the window, see!\nShe sits alone--'tis ever _she_!\n\nXXXVII\n\nSo frequently his mind would stray\nHe well-nigh lost the use of sense,\nAlmost became a poet say--\nOh! what had been his eminence!\nIndeed, by force of magnetism\nA Russian poem's mechanism\nMy scholar without aptitude\nAt this time almost understood.\nHow like a poet was my chum\nWhen, sitting by his fire alone\nWhilst cheerily the embers shone,\nHe \"Benedetta\" used to hum,\nOr \"Idol mio,\" and in the grate\nWould lose his slippers or gazette.\n\nXXXVIII\n\nTime flies! a genial air abroad,\nWinter resigned her empire white,\nOneguine ne'er as poet showed\nNor died nor lost his senses quite.\nSpring cheered him up, and he resigned\nHis chambers close wherein confined\nHe marmot-like did hibernate,\nHis double sashes and his grate,\nAnd sallied forth one brilliant morn--\nAlong the Neva's bank he sleighs,\nOn the blue blocks of ice the rays\nOf the sun glisten; muddy, worn,\nThe snow upon the streets doth melt--\nWhither along them doth he pelt?\n\nXXXIX\n\nOneguine whither gallops? Ye\nHave guessed already. Yes, quite so!\nUnto his own Tattiana he,\nIncorrigible rogue, doth go.\nHer house he enters, ghastly white,\nThe vestibule finds empty quite--\nHe enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!\nA door he opens. But why shrank\nHe back as from a sudden blow?--\nAlone the princess sitteth there,\nPallid and with dishevelled hair,\nGazing upon a note below.\nHer tears flow plentifully and\nHer cheek reclines upon her hand.\n\nXL\n\nOh! who her speechless agonies\nCould not in that brief moment guess!\nWho now could fail to recognize\nTattiana in the young princess!\nTortured by pangs of wild regret,\nEugene fell prostrate at her feet--\nShe starts, nor doth a word express,\nBut gazes on Oneguine's face\nWithout amaze or wrath displayed:\nHis sunken eye and aspect faint,\nImploring looks and mute complaint\nShe comprehends. The simple maid\nBy fond illusions once possest\nIs once again made manifest.\n\nXLI\n\nHis kneeling posture he retains--\nCalmly her eyes encounter his--\nInsensible her hand remains\nBeneath his lips' devouring kiss.\nWhat visions then her fancy thronged--\nA breathless silence then, prolonged--\nBut finally she softly said:\n\"Enough, arise! for much we need\nWithout disguise ourselves explain.\nOneguine, hast forgotten yet\nThe hour when--Fate so willed--we met\nIn the lone garden and the lane?\nHow meekly then I heard you preach--\nTo-day it is my turn to teach.\n\nXLII\n\n\"Oneguine, I was younger then,\nAnd better, if I judge aright;\nI loved you--what did I obtain?\nAffection how did you requite?\nBut with austerity!--for you\nNo novelty--is it not true?--\nWas the meek love a maiden feels.\nBut now--my very blood congeals,\nCalling to mind your icy look\nAnd sermon--but in that dread hour\nI blame not your behaviour--\nAn honourable course ye took,\nDisplayed a noble rectitude--\nMy soul is filled with gratitude!\n\nXLIII\n\n\"Then, in the country, is't not true?\nAnd far removed from rumour vain;\nI did not please you. Why pursue\nMe now, inflict upon me pain?--\nWherefore am I your quarry held?--\nIs it that I am now compelled\nTo move in fashionable life,\nThat I am rich, a prince's wife?--\nBecause my lord, in battles maimed,\nIs petted by the Emperor?--\nThat my dishonour would ensure\nA notoriety proclaimed,\nAnd in society might shed\nA bastard fame prohibited?\n\nXLIV\n\n\"I weep. And if within your breast\nMy image hath not disappeared,\nKnow that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,\nYour conversation cold and hard,\nIf the choice in my power were,\nTo lawless love I should prefer--\nAnd to these letters and these tears.\nFor visions of my childish years\nThen ye were barely generous,\nAge immature averse to cheat--\nBut now--what brings you to my feet?--\nHow mean, how pusillanimous!\nA prudent man like you and brave\nTo shallow sentiment a slave!\n\nXLV\n\n\"Oneguine, all this sumptuousness,\nThe gilding of life's vanities,\nIn the world's vortex my success,\nMy splendid house and gaieties--\nWhat are they? Gladly would I yield\nThis life in masquerade concealed,\nThis glitter, riot, emptiness,\nFor my wild garden and bookcase,--\nYes! for our unpretending home,\nOneguine--the beloved place\nWhere the first time I saw your face,--\nOr for the solitary tomb\nWherein my poor old nurse doth lie\nBeneath a cross and shrubbery.\n\nXLVI\n\n\"'Twas possible then, happiness--\nNay, near--but destiny decreed--\nMy lot is fixed--with thoughtlessness\nIt may be that I did proceed--\nWith bitter tears my mother prayed,\nAnd for Tattiana, mournful maid,\nIndifferent was her future fate.\nI married--now, I supplicate--\nFor ever your Tattiana leave.\nYour heart possesses, I know well,\nHonour and pride inflexible.\nI love you--to what end deceive?--\nBut I am now another's bride--\nFor ever faithful will abide.\"\n\nXLVII\n\nShe rose--departed. But Eugene\nStood as if struck by lightning fire.\nWhat a storm of emotions keen\nRaged round him and of balked desire!\nAnd hark! the clank of spurs is heard\nAnd Tania's husband soon appeared.--\nBut now our hero we must leave\nJust at a moment which I grieve\nMust be pronounced unfortunate--\nFor long--for ever. To be sure\nTogether we have wandered o'er\nThe world enough. Congratulate\nEach other as the shore we climb!\nHurrah! it long ago was time!\n\nXLVIII\n\nReader, whoever thou mayst be,\nFoeman or friend, I do aspire\nTo part in amity with thee!\nAdieu! whate'er thou didst desire\nFrom careless stanzas such as these,\nOf passion reminiscences,\nPictures of the amusing scene,\nRepose from labour, satire keen,\nOr faults of grammar on its page--\nGod grant that all who herein glance,\nIn serious mood or dalliance\nOr in a squabble to engage,\nMay find a crumb to satisfy.\nNow we must separate. Good-bye!\n\nXLIX\n\nAnd farewell thou, my gloomy friend,\nThou also, my ideal true,\nAnd thou, persistent to the end,\nMy little book. With thee I knew\nAll that a poet could desire,\nOblivion of life's tempest dire,\nOf friends the grateful intercourse--\nOh, many a year hath run its course\nSince I beheld Eugene and young\nTattiana in a misty dream,\nAnd my romance's open theme\nGlittered in a perspective long,\nAnd I discerned through Fancy's prism\nDistinctly not its mechanism.\n\nL\n\nBut ye to whom, when friendship heard,\nThe first-fruits of my tale I read,\nAs Saadi anciently averred--(86)\nSome are afar and some are dead.\nWithout them Eugene is complete;\nAnd thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;\nWas drawn, ideal of my lay--\nAh! what hath fate not torn away!\nHappy who quit life's banquet seat\nBefore the dregs they shall divine\nOf the cup brimming o'er with wine--\nWho the romance do not complete,\nBut who abandon it--as I\nHave my Oneguine--suddenly.\n\n[Note 86: The celebrated Persian poet. Pushkin uses the passage\nreferred to as an epigraph to the \"Fountain of Baktchiserai.\" It\nruns thus: \"Many, even as I, visited that fountain, but some of\nthese are dead and some have journeyed afar.\" Saadi was born in\n1189 at Shiraz and was a reputed descendant from Ali, Mahomet's\nson-in-law.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":62,"split":"train"}
