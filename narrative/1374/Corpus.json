Sir Howard Hallam, a judge, and his sister-in-law, Lady Cicely Waynflete, a well-known explorer, are at the home of Rankin, a Presbyterian minister. Rankin, knows Sir Howard as the brother of an old friend, Miles Hallam, who moved to Brazil after marrying a local woman. Sir Howard tells Rankin that his brother's property was illicitly seized after his death by his widow's family, but Sir Howard has now recovered it. Lady Cicely decides to explore Morocco with Sir Howard. They are advised to take an armed escort. This can be organised by Captain Brassbound, a smuggler who owns a ship called Thanksgiving. When Brassbound arrives, he warns Sir Howard that in the mountain-country justice is ruled by codes of honour, not law courts.\nACT II, A Moorish castle occupied by Brassbound. Marzo, an Italian member of Brassbound's crew, has been wounded in a feud. Lady Cicely is tending to him, initially to Brassbound's irritation, but she wins him over. Sir Howard complains that Brassbound is behaving more like a jailer than a host; Brassbound says that Sir Howard is his prisoner. Brassbound explains that he is the son of Sir Howard's deceased brother, Miles. He blames Sir Howard for the death of his mother and for tricking him out of his inheritance by legal technicalities. He intends to hand over Sir Howard to a fanatical Islamist Sheik. He tells Sir Howard that he presides over an unfair justice system that punishes the poor and weak. Now that Sir Howard is powerless he will receive the justice of revenge. Lady Cicely intercedes and argues with Brassbound that his own code of honour is at least as brutal as the legal system he condemns. Brassbound wavers, and eventually agrees to give up revenge. When the Sheik arrives he offers to buy back Sir Howard, but the Shiek will only accept one price \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lady Cicely. Cicely agrees, but at this point the local ruler appears, having learned of the transaction. He frees Sir Howard and arrests Brassbound.\nACT III, Rankin's house. Commander Kearney is to preside over a court of inquiry into Brassbound's actions. Sir Howard says he cannot interfere, but Lady Cicely persuades him to let her tell the court all that happened on the trip. She uses all her powers of persuasion to convince Commander Kearney that Brassbound is innocent of any crime. Kearney agrees to release Brassbound. The liberated Brassbound declares his devotion to Lady Cicely, and says he wishes to marry her. Lady Cicely is powerfully drawn to Brassbound, and fears that she may succumb to his charisma. As she is about to agree, a gunshot is heard. It is the signal from Brassbound's crew that his ship is ready to depart. He leaves immediately, leaving Lady Cicely to say \"What an escape!\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Captain Brassbound's Conversion, by George Bernard Shaw\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He is\nan elderly Scotchman, spiritually a little weatherbeaten, as having to\nnavigate his creed in strange waters crowded with other craft but still\na convinced son of the Free Church and the North African Mission, with\na faithful brown eye, and a peaceful soul. Physically a wiry small-knit\nman, well tanned, clean shaven, with delicate resolute features and\na twinkle of mild humor. He wears the sun helmet and pagri, the\nneutral-tinted spectacles, and the white canvas Spanish sand shoes of\nthe modern Scotch missionary: but instead of a cheap tourist's suit from\nGlasgow, a grey flannel shirt with white collar, a green sailor knot tie\nwith a cheap pin in it, he wears a suit of clean white linen, acceptable\nin color, if not in cut, to the Moorish mind.\n\nThe view from the garden includes much Atlantic Ocean and a long stretch\nof sandy coast to the south, swept by the north east trade wind,\nand scantily nourishing a few stunted pepper trees, mangy palms, and\ntamarisks. The prospect ends, as far as the land is concerned, in\nlittle hills that come nearly to the sea: rudiments, these, of the Atlas\nMountains. The missionary, having had daily opportunities of looking at\nthis seascape for thirty years or so, pays no heed to it, being absorbed\nin trimming a huge red geranium bush, to English eyes unnaturally\nbig, which, with a dusty smilax or two, is the sole product of his pet\nflower-bed. He is sitting to his work on a Moorish stool. In the middle\nof the garden there is a pleasant seat in the shade of a tamarisk tree.\nThe house is in the south west corner of the garden, and the geranium\nbush in the north east corner.\n\nAt the garden-door of the house there appears presently a man who is\nclearly no barbarian, being in fact a less agreeable product peculiar\nto modern commercial civilization. His frame and flesh are those of an\nill-nourished lad of seventeen; but his age is inscrutable: only the\nabsence of any sign of grey in his mud colored hair suggests that he is\nat all events probably under forty, without prejudice to the possibility\nof his being under twenty. A Londoner would recognize him at once as an\nextreme but hardy specimen of the abortion produced by nature in a city\nslum. His utterance, affectedly pumped and hearty, and naturally vulgar\nand nasal, is ready and fluent: nature, a Board School education, and\nsome kerbstone practice having made him a bit of an orator. His dialect,\napart from its base nasal delivery, is not unlike that of smart London\nsociety in its tendency to replace diphthongs by vowels (sometimes\nrather prettily) and to shuffle all the traditional vowel\npronunciations. He pronounces ow as ah, and i as aw, using the ordinary\now for o, i for a, a for u, and e for a, with this reservation, that\nwhen any vowel is followed by an r he signifies its presence, not by\npronouncing the r, which he never does under these circumstances, but by\nprolonging and modifyinq the vowel, sometimes even to the extreme degree\nof pronouncing it properly. As to his yol for l (a compendious delivery\nof the provincial eh-al), and other metropolitan refinements, amazing to\nall but cockneys, they cannot be indicated, save in the above imperfect\nmanner, without the aid of a phonetic alphabet. He is dressed in\nsomebody else's very second best as a coast-guardsman, and gives himself\nthe airs of a stage tar with sufficient success to pass as a possible\nfish porter of bad character in casual employment during busy times\nat Billingsgate. His manner shows an earnest disposition to ingratiate\nhimself with the missionary, probably for some dishonest purpose.\n\nTHE MAN. Awtenoon, Mr. Renkin. (The missionary sits up quickly, and\nturns, resigning himself dutifully to the interruption.) Yr honor's\neolth.\n\nRANKIN (reservedly). Good afternoon, Mr. Drinkwotter.\n\nDRINKWATER. You're not best pleased to be hinterrupted in yr bit o\ngawdnin bow the lawk o me, gavner.\n\nRANKIN. A missionary knows nothing of leks of that soart, or of disleks\neither, Mr. Drinkwotter. What can I do for ye?\n\nDRINKWATER (heartily). Nathink, gavner. Awve brort noos fer yer.\n\nRANKIN. Well, sit ye doon.\n\nDRINKWATER. Aw thenk yr honor. (He sits down on the seat under the tree\nand composes himself for conversation.) Hever ear o Jadge Ellam?\n\nRANKIN. Sir Howrrd Hallam?\n\nDRINKWATER. Thet's im-enginest jadge in Hingland!--awlus gives the ket\nwen it's robbry with voylence, bless is awt. Aw sy nathink agin im: awm\nall fer lor mawseolf, AW em.\n\nRANKIN. Well?\n\nDRINKWATER. Hever ear of is sist-in-lor: Lidy Sisly Winefleet?\n\nRANKIN. Do ye mean the celebrated Leddy--the traveller?\n\nDRINKWATER. Yuss: should think aw doo. Walked acrost Harfricar with\nnathink but a little dawg, and wrowt abaht it in the Dily Mile (the\nDaily Mail, a popular London newspaper), she did.\n\nRANKIN. Is she Sir Howrrd Hallam's sister-in-law?\n\nDRINKWATER. Deeceased wawfe's sister: yuss: thet's wot SHE is.\n\nRANKIN. Well, what about them?\n\nDRINKWATER. Wot abaht them! Waw, they're EAH. Lannid aht of a steam\nyacht in Mogador awber not twenty minnits agow. Gorn to the British\ncornsl's. E'll send em orn to you: e ynt got naowheres to put em.

Down't mention it, gavner. Lor bless yer, wawn't it you as\nconverted me? Wot was aw wen aw cam eah but a pore lorst sinner? Down't\naw ow y'a turn fer thet? Besawds, gavner, this Lidy Sisly Winefleet mawt\nwor't to tike a walk crost Morocker--a rawd inter the mahntns or sech\nlawk. Weoll, as you knaow, gavner, thet cawn't be done eah withaht a\nhescort.\n\nRANKIN. It's impoassible: th' would oall b' murrdered. Morocco is not\nlek the rest of Africa.\n\nDRINKWATER. No, gavner: these eah Moors ez their religion; an it mikes\nem dinegerous. Hever convert a Moor, gavner?\n\nRANKIN (with a rueful smile). No.\n\nDRINKWATER (solemnly). Nor never will, gavner.\n\nRANKIN. I have been at work here for twenty-five years, Mr. Drinkwotter;\nand you are my first and only convert.\n\nDRINKWATER. Down't seem naow good, do it, gavner?\n\nRANKIN. I don't say that. I hope I have done some good. They come to me\nfor medicine when they are ill; and they call me the Christian who is\nnot a thief. THAT is something.\n\nDRINKWATER. Their mawnds kennot rawse to Christiennity lawk hahrs\nken, gavner: thet's ah it is. Weoll, ez haw was syin, if a hescort\nis wornted, there's maw friend and commawnder Kepn Brarsbahnd of the\nschooner Thenksgivin, an is crew, incloodin mawseolf, will see the lidy\nan Jadge Ellam through henny little excursion in reason. Yr honor mawt\nmention it.\n\nRANKIN. I will certainly not propose anything so dangerous as an\nexcursion.\n\nDRINKWATER (virtuously). Naow, gavner, nor would I awst you to. (Shaking\nhis head.) Naow, naow: it IS dinegerous. But hall the more call for a\nhescort if they should ev it hin their mawnds to gow.\n\nRANKIN. I hope they won't.\n\nDRINKWATER. An sow aw do too, gavner.\n\nRANKIN (pondering). 'Tis strange that they should come to Mogador, of\nall places; and to my house! I once met Sir Howrrd Hallam, years ago.\n\nDRINKWATER (amazed). Naow! didger? Think o thet, gavner! Waw, sow aw did\ntoo. But it were a misunnerstedin, thet wors. Lef the court withaht a\nstine on maw kerrickter, aw did.\n\nRANKIN (with some indignation). I hope you don't think I met Sir Howrrd\nin that way.\n\nDRINKWATER. Mawt yeppn to the honestest, best meanin pusson, aw do\nassure yer, gavner.\n\nRANKIN. I would have you to know that I met him privately, Mr.\nDrinkwotter. His brother was a dear friend of mine. Years ago. He went\nout to the West Indies.\n\nDRINKWATER. The Wust Hindies! Jist acrost there, tather sawd thet\nhowcean (pointing seaward)! Dear me! We cams hin with vennity, an we\ndeepawts in dawkness. Down't we, gavner?\n\nRANKIN (pricking up his ears). Eh? Have you been reading that little\nbook I gave you?\n\nDRINKWATER. Aw hev, et odd tawms. Very camfitn, gavner. (He rises,\napprehensive lest further catechism should find him unprepared.) Awll\nsy good awtenoon, gavner: you're busy hexpectin o Sr Ahrd an Lidy Sisly,\nynt yer? (About to go.)\n\nRANKIN (stopping him). No, stop: we're oalways ready for travellers\nhere. I have something else to say--a question to ask you.\n\nDRINKWATER (with a misgiving, which he masks by exaggerating his hearty\nsailor manner). An weollcome, yr honor.\n\nRANKIN. Who is this Captain Brassbound?\n\nDRINKWATER (guiltily). Kepn Brarsbahnd! E's-weoll, e's maw Kepn, gavner.\n\nRANKIN. Yes. Well?\n\nDRINKWATER (feebly). Kepn of the schooner Thenksgivin, gavner.\n\nRANKIN (searchingly). Have ye ever haird of a bad character in these\nseas called Black Paquito?\n\nDRINKWATER (with a sudden radiance of complete enlightenment). Aoh, nar\naw tikes yer wiv me, yr honor. Nah sammun es bin a teolln you thet Kepn\nBrarsbahnd an Bleck Pakeetow is hawdentically the sime pussn. Ynt thet\nsow?\n\nRANKIN. That is so. (Drinkwater slaps his knee triumphantly. The\nmissionary proceeds determinedly) And the someone was a verra honest,\nstraightforward man, as far as I could judge.\n\nDRINKWATER (embracing the implication). Course a wors, gavner: Ev aw\nsaid a word agin him? Ev aw nah?\n\nRANKIN. But is Captain Brassbound Black Paquito then?\n\nDRINKWATER. Waw, it's the nime is blessed mather give im at er\nknee, bless is little awt! Ther ynt naow awm in it. She ware a Wust\nHinjin--howver there agin, yer see (pointing seaward)--leastwaws, naow\nshe worn't: she were a Brazilian, aw think; an Pakeetow's Brazilian for\na bloomin little perrit--awskin yr pawdn for the word. (Sentimentally)\nLawk as a Hinglish lidy mawt call er little boy Birdie.\n\nRANKIN (not quite convinced). But why BLACK Paquito?\n\nDRINKWATER (artlessly). Waw, the bird in its netral stite bein green, an\ne evin bleck air, y' knaow--\n\nRANKIN (cutting him short). I see. And now I will put ye another\nquestion. WHAT is Captain Brassbound, or Paquito, or whatever he calls\nhimself?\n\nDRINKWATER (officiously). Brarsbahnd, gavner. Awlus calls isseolf\nBrarsbahnd.\n\nRANKIN. Well. Brassbound, then. What is he?\n\nDRINKWATER (fervently). You awsks me wot e is, gavner?\n\nRANKIN (firmly). I do.\n\nDRINKWATER (with rising enthusiasm). An shll aw teoll yer wot e is, yr\nhonor?\n\nRANKIN (not at all impressed). If ye will be so good, Mr. Drinkwotter.\n\nDRINKWATER (with overwhelming conviction). Then awll teoll you, gavner,\nwot he is. Ee's a Paffick Genlmn: thet's wot e is.\n\nRANKIN (gravely). Mr. Drinkwotter: pairfection is an attribute, not\nof West Coast captains, but of thr Maaker. And there are gentlemen and\ngentlemen in the world, espaecially in these latitudes. Which sort of\ngentleman is he?\n\nDRINKWATER. Hinglish genlmn, gavner. Hinglish speakin; Hinglish fawther;\nWest Hinjin plawnter; Hinglish true blue breed. (Reflectively) Tech o\nbrahn from the mather, preps, she bein Brazilian.\n\nRANKIN. Now on your faith as a Christian, Felix Drinkwotter, is Captain\nBrassbound a slaver or not?\n\nDRINKWATER (surprised into his natural cockney pertness). Naow e ynt.\n\nRANKIN. Are ye SURE?\n\nDRINKWATER. Waw, a sliver is abaht the wanne thing in the wy of a genlmn\no fortn thet e YNT.\n\nRANKIN. I've haird that expression \"gentleman of fortune\" before, Mr.\nDrinkwotter. It means pirate. Do ye know that?\n\nDRINKWATER. Bless y'r awt, y' cawnt be a pawrit naradys. Waw, the aw\nseas is wuss pleest nor Piccadilly Suckus. If aw was to do orn thet\nthere Hetlentic Howcean the things aw did as a bwoy in the Worterleoo\nRowd, awd ev maw air cat afore aw could turn maw ed. Pawrit be\nblaowed!--awskink yr pawdn, gavner.

I don't know.\n\nDRINKWATER. Gawdn, gavner, Gawdn. Gawdn o Kawtoom--stetcher stends in\nTrifawlgr Square to this dy. Trined Bleck Pakeetow in smawshin hap the\nslive riders, e did. Promist Gawdn e wouldn't never smaggle slives nor\ngin, an (with suppressed aggravation) WOWN'T, gavner, not if we gows\ndahn on ahr bloomin bended knees to im to do it.\n\nRANKIN (drily). And DO ye go down on your bended knees to him to do it?\n\nDRINKWATER (somewhat abashed). Some of huz is hanconverted men, gavner;\nan they sy: You smaggles wanne thing, Kepn; waw not hanather?\n\nRANKIN. We've come to it at last. I thought so. Captain Brassbound is a\nsmuggler.\n\nDRINKWATER. Weoll, waw not? Waw not, gavner? Ahrs is a Free Tride\nnition. It gows agin us as Hinglishmen to see these bloomin furriners\nsettin ap their Castoms Ahses and spheres o hinfluence and sich lawk\nhall owver Arfricar. Daown't Harfricar belong as much to huz as to them?\nthet's wot we sy. Ennywys, there ynt naow awm in ahr business. All we\ndaz is hescort, tourist HOR commercial. Cook's hexcursions to the Hatlas\nMahntns: thet's hall it is. Waw, it's spreadin civlawzytion, it is. Ynt\nit nah?\n\nRANKIN. You think Captain Brassbound's crew sufficiently equipped for\nthat, do you?\n\nDRINKWATER. Hee-quipped! Haw should think sow. Lawtnin rawfles, twelve\nshots in the meggezine! Oo's to storp us?\n\nRANKIN. The most dangerous chieftain in these parts, the Sheikh Sidi el\nAssif, has a new American machine pistol which fires ten bullets without\nloadin; and his rifle has sixteen shots in the magazine.\n\nDRINKWATER (indignantly). Yuss; an the people that sells sich\nthings into the ends o' them eathen bleck niggers calls theirseolves\nChristians! It's a crool shime, sow it is.\n\nRANKIN. If a man has the heart to pull the trigger, it matters little\nwhat color his hand is, Mr. Drinkwotter. Have ye anything else to say to\nme this afternoon?\n\nDRINKWATER (rising). Nathink, gavner, cept to wishyer the bust o yolth,\nand a many cornverts. Awtenoon, gavner.\n\nRANKIN. Good afternoon to ye, Mr. Drinkwotter.\n\nAs Drinkwater turns to go, a Moorish porter comes from the house with\ntwo Krooboys.\n\nTHE PORTER (at the door, addressing Rankin). Bikouros (Moroccan for\nEpicurus, a general Moorish name for the missionaries, who are supposed\nby the Moors to have chosen their calling through a love of luxurious\nidleness): I have brought to your house a Christian dog and his woman.\n\nDRINKWATER. There's eathen menners fer yer! Calls Sr Ahrd Ellam an Lidy\nWinefleet a Christian dorg and is woman! If ee ed you in the dorck\net the Centl Crimnal, you'd fawnd aht oo was the dorg and oo was is\nmarster, pretty quick, you would.\n\nRANKIN. Have you broat their boxes?\n\nTHE PORTER. By Allah, two camel loads!\n\nRANKIN. Have you been paid?\n\nTHE PORTER. Only one miserable dollar, Bikouros. I have brought them to\nyour house. They will pay you. Give me something for bringing gold to\nyour door.\n\nDRINKWATER. Yah! You oughter bin bawn a Christian, you ought. You knaow\ntoo mach.\n\nRANKIN. You have broat onnly trouble and expense to my door, Hassan;\nand you know it. Have I ever charged your wife and children for my\nmedicines?\n\nHASSAN (philosophically). It is always permitted by the Prophet to ask,\nBikouros. (He goes cheerfully into the house with the Krooboys.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Jist thort eed trah it orn, a did. Hooman nitre is the sime\neverywheres. Them eathens is jast lawk you an' me, gavner.\n\nA lady and gentleman, both English, come into the garden. The gentleman,\nmore than elderly, is facing old age on compulsion, not resignedly. He\nis clean shaven, and has a brainy rectangular forehead, a resolute nose\nwith strongly governed nostrils, and a tightly fastened down mouth which\nhas evidently shut in much temper and anger in its time. He has a habit\nof deliberately assumed authority and dignity, but is trying to take\nlife more genially and easily in his character of tourist, which is\nfurther borne out by his white hat and summery racecourse attire.\n\nThe lady is between thirty and forty, tall, very goodlooking,\nsympathetic, intelligent, tender and humorous, dressed with cunning\nsimplicity not as a businesslike, tailor made, gaitered tourist, but as\nif she lived at the next cottage and had dropped in for tea in blouse\nand flowered straw hat. A woman of great vitality and humanity, who\nbegins a casual acquaintance at the point usually attained by English\npeople after thirty years acquaintance when they are capable of reaching\nit at all. She pounces genially on Drinkwater, who is smirking at her,\nhat in hand, with an air of hearty welcome. The gentleman, on the other\nhand, comes down the side of the garden next the house, instinctively\nmaintaining a distance between himself and the others.\n\nTHE LADY (to Drinkwater). How dye do? Are you the missionary?\n\nDRINKWATER (modestly). Naow, lidy, aw will not deceive you, thow the\nmistike his but netral. Awm wanne of the missionary's good works,\nlidy--is first cornvert, a umble British seaman--countrymen o yours,\nlidy, and of is lawdship's. This eah is Mr. Renkin, the bust worker in\nthe wust cowst vawnyawd. (Introducing the judge) Mr. Renkin: is lawdship\nSr Ahrd Ellam. (He withdraws discreetly into the house.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (to Rankin). I am sorry to intrude on you, Mr. Rankin; but in\nthe absence of a hotel there seems to be no alternative.\n\nLADY CICELY (beaming on him). Besides, we would so much RATHER stay with\nyou, if you will have us, Mr. Rankin.\n\nSIR HOWARD (introducing her). My sister-in-law, Lady Cicely Waynflete,\nMr. Rankin.\n\nRANKIN. I am glad to be of service to your leddyship. You will be\nwishing to have some tea after your journey, I'm thinking.\n\nLADY CICELY. Thoughtful man that you are, Mr. Rankin! But we've had\nsome already on board the yacht. And I've arranged everything with your\nservants; so you must go on gardening just as if we were not here.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I am sorry to have to warn you, Mr. Rankin, that Lady\nCicely, from travelling in Africa, has acquired a habit of walking into\npeople's houses and behaving as if she were in her own.\n\nLADY CICELY. But, my dear Howard, I assure you the natives like it.\n\nRANKIN (gallantly). So do I.\n\nLADY CICELY (delighted). Oh, that is so nice of you, Mr. Rankin. This\nis a delicious country! And the people seem so good! They have such\nnice faces! We had such a handsome Moor to carry our luggage up! And two\nperfect pets of Krooboys! Did you notice their faces, Howard?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I did; and I can confidently say, after a long experience of\nfaces of the worst type looking at me from the dock, that I have never\nseen so entirely villainous a trio as that Moor and the two Krooboys, to\nwhom you gave five dollars when they would have been perfectly satisfied\nwith one.\n\nRANKIN (throwing up his hands). Five dollars! 'Tis easy to see you are\nnot Scotch, my leddy.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, poor things, they must want it more than we do; and you\nknow, Howard, that Mahometans never spend money in drink.\n\nRANKIN. Excuse me a moment, my leddy. I have a word in season to say to\nthat same Moor. (He goes into the house.)\n\nLADY CICELY (walking about the garden, looking at the view and at the\nflowers). I think this is a perfectly heavenly place.\n\nDrinkwater returns from the house with a chair.\n\nDRINKWATER (placing the chair for Sir Howard). Awskink yr pawdn for the\nlibbety, Sr Ahrd.\n\nSIR HOWARD (looking a him). I have seen you before somewhere.\n\nDRINKWATER. You ev, Sr Ahrd. But aw do assure yer it were hall a\nmistike.\n\nSIR HOWARD. As usual. (He sits down.) Wrongfully convicted, of course.\n\nDRINKWATER (with sly delight). Naow, gavner. (Half whispering, with an\nineffable grin) Wrorngfully hacquittid!\n\nSIR HOWARD. Indeed! That's the first case of the kind I have ever met.\n\nDRINKWATER. Lawd, Sr Ahrd, wot jagginses them jurymen was! You an me\nknaowed it too, didn't we?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I daresay we did. I am sorry to say I forget the exact\nnature of the difficulty you were in. Can you refresh my memory?\n\nDRINKWATER. Owny the aw sperrits o youth, y' lawdship. Worterleoo Rowd\nkice. Wot they calls Ooliganism.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Oh! You were a Hooligan, were you?\n\nLADY CICELY (puzzled). A Hooligan!\n\nDRINKWATER (deprecatingly). Nime giv huz pore thortless leds baw a gent\non the Dily Chrornicle, lidy. (Rankin returns. Drinkwater immediately\nwithdraws, stopping the missionary for a moment near the threshold to\nsay, touching his forelock) Awll eng abaht within ile, gavner, hin kice\naw should be wornted. (He goes into the house with soft steps.)\n\nLady Cicely sits down on the bench under the tamarisk. Rankin takes his\nstool from the flowerbed and sits down on her left, Sir Howard being on\nher right.\n\nLADY CICELY. What a pleasant face your sailor friend has, Mr. Rankin! He\nhas been so frank and truthful with us. You know I don't think anybody\ncan pay me a greater compliment than to be quite sincere with me at\nfirst sight. It's the perfection of natural good manners.\n\nSIR HOWARD. You must not suppose, Mr. Rankin, that my sister-in-law\ntalks nonsense on purpose. She will continue to believe in your friend\nuntil he steals her watch; and even then she will find excuses for him.\n\nRANKIN (drily changing the subject). And how have ye been, Sir Howrrd,\nsince our last meeting that morning nigh forty year ago down at the\ndocks in London?\n\nSIR HOWARD (greatly surprised, pulling himself together) Our last\nmeeting! Mr. Rankin: have I been unfortunate enough to forget an old\nacquaintance?\n\nRANKIN. Well, perhaps hardly an acquaintance, Sir Howrrd. But I was a\nclose friend of your brother Miles: and when he sailed for Brazil I\nwas one of the little party that saw him off. You were one of the party\nalso, if I'm not mistaken. I took particular notice of you because you\nwere Miles's brother and I had never seen ye before. But ye had no call\nto take notice of me.\n\nSIR HOWARD (reflecting). Yes: there was a young friend of my brother's\nwho might well be you. But the name, as I recollect it, was Leslie.\n\nRANKIN. That was me, sir. My name is Leslie Rankin; and your brother and\nI were always Miles and Leslie to one another.\n\nSIR HOWARD (pluming himself a little). Ah! that explains it. I can trust\nmy memory still, Mr. Rankin; though some people do complain that I am\ngrowing old.\n\nRANKIN. And where may Miles be now, Sir Howard?\n\nSIR HOWARD (abruptly). Don't you know that he is dead?\n\nRANKIN (much shocked). Never haird of it. Dear, dear: I shall never see\nhim again; and I can scarcely bring his face to mind after all these\nyears. (With moistening eyes, which at once touch Lady Cicely's\nsympathy) I'm right sorry--right sorry.\n\nSIR HOWARD (decorously subduing his voice). Yes: he did not live long:\nindeed, he never came back to England. It must be nearly thirty years\nago now that he died in the West Indies on his property there.\n\nRANKIN (surprised). His proaperty! Miles with a proaperty!\n\nSIR HOWARD. Yes: he became a planter, and did well out there, Mr.\nRankin. The history of that property is a very curious and interesting\none--at least it is so to a lawyer like myself.\n\nRANKIN. I should be glad to hear it for Miles's sake, though I am no\nlawyer, Sir Howrrd.\n\nLADY CICELY. I never knew you had a brother, Howard.\n\nSIR HOWARD (not pleased by this remark). Perhaps because you never asked\nme. (Turning more blandly to Rankin) I will tell you the story, Mr.\nRankin. When Miles died, he left an estate in one of the West Indian\nislands. It was in charge of an agent who was a sharpish fellow, with\nall his wits about him. Now, sir, that man did a thing which probably\ncould hardly be done with impunity even here in Morocco, under the most\nbarbarous of surviving civilizations. He quite simply took the estate\nfor himself and kept it.\n\nRANKIN. But how about the law?\n\nSIR HOWARD. The law, sir, in that island, consisted practically of the\nAttorney General and the Solicitor General; and these gentlemen were\nboth retained by the agent. Consequently there was no solicitor in the\nisland to take up the case against him.\n\nRANKIN. Is such a thing possible to-day in the British Empire?\n\nSIR HOWARD (calmly). Oh, quite. Quite.\n\nLADY CICELY. But could not a firstrate solicitor have been sent out from\nLondon?\n\nSIR HOWARD. No doubt, by paying him enough to compensate him for\ngiving up his London practice: that is, rather more than there was any\nreasonable likelihood of the estate proving worth.\n\nRANKIN. Then the estate was lost?\n\nSIR HOWARD. Not permanently. It is in my hands at present.\n\nRANKIN. Then how did ye get it back?\n\nSIR HOWARD (with crafty enjoyment of his own cunning). By hoisting the\nrogue with his own petard. I had to leave matters as they were for many\nyears; for I had my own position in the world to make. But at last I\nmade it. In the course of a holiday trip to the West Indies, I found\nthat this dishonest agent had left the island, and placed the estate in\nthe hands of an agent of his own, whom he was foolish enough to pay very\nbadly. I put the case before that agent; and he decided to treat the\nestate as my property. The robber now found himself in exactly the same\nposition he had formerly forced me into. Nobody in the island would\nact against me, least of all the Attorney and Solicitor General, who\nappreciated my influence at the Colonial Office. And so I got the estate\nback. \"The mills of the gods grind slowly,\" Mr. Rankin; \"but they grind\nexceeding small.\"\n\nLADY CICELY. Now I suppose if I'd done such a clever thing in England,\nyou'd have sent me to prison.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Probably, unless you had taken care to keep outside the law\nagainst conspiracy. Whenever you wish to do anything against the law,\nCicely, always consult a good solicitor first.\n\nLADY CICELY. So I do. But suppose your agent takes it into his head to\ngive the estate back to his wicked old employer!\n\nSIR HOWARD. I heartily wish he would.\n\nRANKIN (openeyed). You wish he WOULD!!\n\nSIR HOWARD. Yes. A few years ago the collapse of the West Indian sugar\nindustry converted the income of the estate into an annual loss of\nabout 150 pounds a year. If I can't sell it soon, I shall simply abandon\nit--unless you, Mr. Rankin, would like to take it as a present.\n\nRANKIN (laughing). I thank your lordship: we have estates enough of\nthat sort in Scotland. You're setting with your back to the sun, Leddy\nCeecily, and losing something worth looking at. See there. (He rises and\npoints seaward, where the rapid twilight of the latitude has begun.)\n\nLADY CICELY (getting up to look and uttering a cry of admiration). Oh,\nhow lovely!\n\nSIR HOWARD (also rising). What are those hills over there to the\nsoutheast?\n\nRANKIN. They are the outposts, so to speak, of the Atlas Mountains.\n\nLADY CICELY. The Atlas Mountains! Where Shelley's witch lived! We'll\nmake an excursion to them to-morrow, Howard.\n\nRANKIN. That's impoassible, my leddy. The natives are verra dangerous.\n\nLADY CICELY. Why? Has any explorer been shooting them?\n\nRANKIN. No. But every man of them believes he will go to heaven if he\nkills an unbeliever.\n\nLADY CICELY. Bless you, dear Mr. Rankin, the people in England believe\nthat they will go to heaven if they give all their property to the poor.\nBut they don't do it. I'm not a bit afraid of that.\n\nRANKIN. But they are not accustomed to see women going about unveiled.\n\nLADY CICELY. I always get on best with people when they can see my face.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Cicely: you are talking great nonsense and you know it.\nThese people have no laws to restrain them, which means, in plain\nEnglish, that they are habitual thieves and murderers.\n\nRANKIN. Nay, nay: not exactly that.\n\nLADY CICELY (indignantly). Of course not. You always think, Howard, that\nnothing prevents people killing each other but the fear of your hanging\nthem for it. But what nonsense that is! And how wicked! If these people\nweren't here for some good purpose, they wouldn't have been made, would\nthey, Mr. Rankin?\n\nRANKIN. That is a point, certainly, Leddy Ceecily.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Oh, if you are going to talk theology--\n\nLADY CICELY. Well, why not? theology is as respectable as law, I should\nthink. Besides, I'm only talking commonsense. Why do people get\nkilled by savages? Because instead of being polite to them, and\nsaying Howdyedo? like me, people aim pistols at them. I've been among\nsavages--cannibals and all sorts. Everybody said they'd kill me. But\nwhen I met them, I said Howdyedo? and they were quite nice. The kings\nalways wanted to marry me.\n\nSIR HOWARD. That does not seem to me to make you any safer here, Cicely.\nYou shall certainly not stir a step beyond the protection of the consul,\nif I can help it, without a strong escort.\n\nLADY CICELY. I don't want an escort.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I do. And I suppose you will expect me to accompany you.\n\nRANKIN. 'Tis not safe, Leddy Ceecily. Really and truly, 'tis not safe.\nThe tribes are verra fierce; and there are cities here that no Christian\nhas ever set foot in. If you go without being well protected, the first\nchief you meet well seize you and send you back again to prevent his\nfollowers murdering you.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, how nice of him, Mr. Rankin!\n\nRANKIN. He would not do it for your sake, Leddy Ceecily, but for his\nown. The Sultan would get into trouble with England if you were killed;\nand the Sultan would kill the chief to pacify the English government.\n\nLADY CICELY. But I always go everywhere. I KNOW the people here won't\ntouch me. They have such nice faces and such pretty scenery.\n\nSIR HOWARD (to Rankin, sitting down again resignedly). You can imagine\nhow much use there is in talking to a woman who admires the faces of the\nruffians who infest these ports, Mr. Rankin. Can anything be done in the\nway of an escort?\n\nRANKIN. There is a certain Captain Brassbound here who trades along the\ncoast, and occasionally escorts parties of merchants on journeys into\nthe interior. I understand that he served under Gordon in the Soudan.\n\nSIR HOWARD. That sounds promising. But I should like to know a little\nmore about him before I trust myself in his hands.\n\nRANKIN. I quite agree with you, Sir Howrrd. I'll send Felix Drinkwotter\nfor him. (He claps his hands. An Arab boy appears at the house door.)\nMuley: is sailor man here? (Muley nods.) Tell sailor man bring captain.\n(Muley nods and goes.)\n\nSIR HOWARD. Who is Drinkwater?\n\nRANKIN. His agent, or mate: I don't rightly know which.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, if he has a mate named Felix Drinkwater, it must be\nquite a respectable crew. It is such a nice name.\n\nRANKIN. You saw him here just now. He is a convert of mine.\n\nLADY CICELY (delighted). That nice truthful sailor!\n\nSIR HOWARD (horrified). What! The Hooligan!\n\nRANKIN (puzzled). Hooligan? No, my lord: he is an Englishman.\n\nSIR HOWARD. My dear Mr. Rankin, this man was tried before me on a charge\nof street ruffianism.\n\nRANKIN. So he told me. He was badly broat up, I am afraid. But he is now\na converted man.\n\nLADY CICELY. Of course he is. His telling you so frankly proves it. You\nknow, really, Howard, all those poor people whom you try are more sinned\nagainst than sinning. If you would only talk to them in a friendly way\ninstead of passing cruel sentences on them, you would find them quite\nnice to you. (Indignantly) I won't have this poor man trampled on merely\nbecause his mother brought him up as a Hooligan. I am sure nobody could\nbe nicer than he was when he spoke to us.\n\nSIR HOWARD. In short, we are to have an escort of Hooligans commanded\nby a filibuster. Very well, very well. You will most likely admire all\ntheir faces; and I have no doubt at all that they will admire yours.\n\nDrinkwater comes from the house with an Italian dressed in a much worn\nsuit of blue serge, a dilapidated Alpine hat, and boots laced with\nscraps of twine. He remains near the door, whilst Drinkwater comes\nforward between Sir Howard and Lady Cicely.\n\nDRINKWATER. Yr honor's servant. (To the Italian) Mawtzow: is lawdship Sr\nAhrd Ellam. (Marzo touches his hat.) Er Lidyship Lidy Winefleet. (Marzo\ntouches his hat.) Hawtellian shipmite, lidy. Hahr chef.\n\nLADY CICELY (nodding affably to Marzo). Howdyedo? I love Italy. What\npart of it were you born in?\n\nDRINKWATER. Worn't bawn in Hitly at all, lidy. Bawn in Ettn Gawdn\n(Hatton Garden). Hawce barrer an street pianner Hawtellian, lidy:\nthet's wot e is. Kepn Brarsbahnd's respects to yr honors; an e awites yr\ncommawnds.\n\nRANKIN. Shall we go indoors to see him?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I think we had better have a look at him by daylight.\n\nRANKIN. Then we must lose no time: the dark is soon down in this\nlatitude. (To Drinkwater) Will ye ask him to step out here to us, Mr.\nDrinkwotter?\n\nDRINKWATER. Rawt you aw, gavner. (He goes officiously into the house.)\n\nLady Cicely and Rankin sit down as before to receive the Captain. The\nlight is by this time waning rapidly, the darkness creeping west into\nthe orange crimson.\n\nLADY CICELY (whispering). Don't you feel rather creepy, Mr. Rankin? I\nwonder what he'll be like.\n\nRANKIN. I misdoubt me he will not answer, your leddyship.\n\nThere is a scuffling noise in the house; and Drinkwater shoots out\nthrough the doorway across the garden with every appearance of having\nbeen violently kicked. Marzo immediately hurries down the garden on Sir\nHoward's right out of the neighborhood of the doorway.\n\nDRINKWATER (trying to put a cheerful air on much mortification and\nbodily anguish). Narsty step to thet ere door tripped me hap, it\ndid. (Raising his voice and narrowly escaping a squeak of pain) Kepn\nBrarsbahnd. (He gets as far from the house as possible, on Rankin's\nleft. Rankin rises to receive his guest.)\n\nAn olive complexioned man with dark southern eyes and hair comes from\nthe house. Age about 36. Handsome features, but joyless; dark eyebrows\ndrawn towards one another; mouth set grimly; nostrils large and\nstrained: a face set to one tragic purpose. A man of few words, fewer\ngestures, and much significance. On the whole, interesting, and even\nattractive, but not friendly. He stands for a moment, saturnine in the\nruddy light, to see who is present, looking in a singular and rather\ndeadly way at Sir Howard; then with some surprise and uneasiness at\nLady Cicely. Finally he comes down into the middle of the garden, and\nconfronts Rankin, who has been glaring at him in consternation from the\nmoment of his entrance, and continues to do so in so marked a way that\nthe glow in Brassbound's eyes deepens as he begins to take offence.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Well, sir, have you stared your fill at me?\n\nRANKIN (recovering himself with a start). I ask your pardon for my bad\nmanners, Captain Brassbound. Ye are extraordinair lek an auld college\nfriend of mine, whose face I said not ten minutes gone that I could no\nlonger bring to mind. It was as if he had come from the grave to remind\nme of it.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Why have you sent for me?\n\nRANKIN. We have a matter of business with ye, Captain.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Who are \"we\"?\n\nRANKIN. This is Sir Howrrd Hallam, who will be well known to ye as one\nof Her Majesty's judges.\n\nBRASSBOUND (turning the singular look again on Sir Howard). The friend\nof the widow! the protector of the fatherless!\n\nSIR HOWARD (startled). I did not know I was so favorably spoken of in\nthese parts, Captain Brassbound. We want an escort for a trip into the\nmountains.\n\nBRASSBOUND (ignoring this announcement). Who is the lady?\n\nRANKIN. Lady Ceecily Waynflete, his lordship's sister-in-law.\n\nLADY CICELY. Howdyedo, Captain Brassbound? (He bows gravely.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (a little impatient of these questions, which strike him as\nsomewhat impertinent). Let us come to business, if you please. We are\nthinking of making a short excursion to see the country about here. Can\nyou provide us with an escort of respectable, trustworthy men?\n\nBRASSBOUND. No.\n\nDRINKWATER (in strong remonstrance). Nah, nah, nah! Nah look eah, Kepn,\ny'knaow--\n\nBRASSBOUND (between his teeth). Hold your tongue.\n\nDRINKWATER (abjectly). Yuss, Kepn.\n\nRANKIN. I understood it was your business to provide escorts, Captain\nBrassbound.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You were rightly informed. That IS my business.\n\nLADY CICELY. Then why won't you do it for us?\n\nBRASSBOUND. You are not content with an escort. You want respectable,\ntrustworthy men. You should have brought a division of London policemen\nwith you. My men are neither respectable nor trustworthy.\n\nDRINKWATER (unable to contain himself). Nah, nah, look eah, Kepn. If you\nwant to be moddist, be moddist on your aown accahnt, nort on mawn.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You see what my men are like. That rascal (indicating Marzo)\nwould cut a throat for a dollar if he had courage enough.\n\nMARZO. I not understand. I no spik Englis.\n\nBRASSBOUND. This thing (pointing to Drinkwater) is the greatest liar,\nthief, drunkard, and rapscallion on the west coast.\n\nDRINKWATER (affecting an ironic indifference). Gow orn, Gow orn. Sr Ahrd\nez erd witnesses to maw kerrickter afoah. E knaows ah mech to believe of\nem.\n\nLADY CICELY. Captain Brassbound: I have heard all that before about\nthe blacks; and I found them very nice people when they were properly\ntreated.\n\nDRINKWATER (chuckling: the Italian is also grinning). Nah, Kepn, nah!\nOwp yr prahd o y'seolf nah.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I quite understand the proper treatment for him, madam. If\nhe opens his mouth again without my leave, I will break every bone in\nhis skin.\n\nLADY CICELY (in her most sunnily matter-of-fact way). Does Captain\nBrassbound always treat you like this, Mr. Drinkwater?\n\nDrinkwater hesitates, and looks apprehensively at the Captain.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Answer, you dog, when the lady orders you. (To Lady Cicely)\nDo not address him as Mr. Drinkwater, madam: he is accustomed to be\ncalled Brandyfaced Jack.\n\nDRINKWATER (indignantly). Eah, aw sy! nah look eah, Kepn: maw nime is\nDrinkworter. You awsk em et Sin Jorn's in the Worterleoo Rowd. Orn maw\ngrenfawther's tombstown, it is.\n\nBRASSBOUND. It will be on your own tombstone, presently, if you cannot\nhold your tongue. (Turning to the others) Let us understand one another,\nif you please. An escort here, or anywhere where there are no regular\ndisciplined forces, is what its captain makes it. If I undertake this\nbusiness, I shall be your escort. I may require a dozen men, just as I\nmay require a dozen horses. Some of the horses will be vicious; so will\nall the men. If either horse or man tries any of his viciousness on me,\nso much the worse for him; but it will make no difference to you. I will\norder my men to behave themselves before the lady; and they shall obey\ntheir orders. But the lady will please understand that I take my own way\nwith them and suffer no interference.\n\nLADY CICELY. Captain Brassbound: I don't want an escort at all. It will\nsimply get us all into danger; and I shall have the trouble of getting\nit out again. That's what escorts always do. But since Sir Howard\nprefers an escort, I think you had better stay at home and let me take\ncharge of it. I know your men will get on perfectly well if they're\nproperly treated.\n\nDRINKWATER (with enthusiasm). Feed aht o yr and, lidy, we would.\n\nBRASSBOUND (with sardonic assent). Good. I agree. (To Drinkwater) You\nshall go without me.\n\nDRINKWATER. (terrified). Eah! Wot are you a syin orn? We cawn't gow\nwithaht yer. (To Lady Cicely) Naow, lidy: it wouldn't be for yr hown\ngood. Yer cawn't hexpect a lot o poor honeddikited men lawk huz to ran\nahrseolvs into dineger withaht naow Kepn to teoll us wot to do. Naow,\nlidy: hoonawted we stend: deevawdid we fall.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, if you prefer your captain, have him by all means. Do\nyou LIKE to be treated as he treats you?\n\nDRINKWATER (with a smile of vanity). Weoll, lidy: y cawn't deenaw that\ne's a Paffick Genlmn. Bit hawbitrairy, preps; but hin a genlmn you looks\nfor sich. It tikes a hawbitrairy wanne to knock aht them eathen Shikes,\naw teoll yer.\n\nBRASSBOUND. That's enough. Go.\n\nDRINKWATER. Weoll, aw was hownly a teolln the lidy thet-- (A threatening\nmovement from Brassbound cuts him short. He flies for his life into the\nhouse, followed by the Italian.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Your ladyship sees. These men serve me by their own free\nchoice. If they are dissatisfied, they go. If I am dissatisfied, they\ngo. They take care that I am not dissatisfied.\n\nSIR HOWARD (who has listened with approval and growing confidence).\nCaptain Brassbound: you are the man I want. If your terms are at\nall reasonable, I will accept your services if we decide to make an\nexcursion. You do not object, Cicely, I hope.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh no. After all, those men must really like you, Captain\nBrassbound. I feel sure you have a kind heart. You have such nice eyes.\n\nSIR HOWARD (scandalized). My DEAR Cicely: you really must restrain your\nexpressions of confidence in people's eyes and faces. (To Brassbound)\nNow, about terms, Captain?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Where do you propose to go?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I hardly know. Where CAN we go, Mr. Rankin?\n\nRANKIN. Take my advice, Sir Howrrd. Don't go far.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I can take you to Meskala, from which you can see the Atlas\nMountains. From Meskala I can take you to an ancient castle in the\nhills, where you can put up as long as you please. The customary charge\nis half a dollar a man per day and his food. I charge double.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I suppose you answer for your men being sturdy fellows, who\nwill stand to their guns if necessary.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I can answer for their being more afraid of me than of the\nMoors.\n\nLADY CICELY. That doesn't matter in the least, Howard. The important\nthing, Captain Brassbound, is: first, that we should have as few men as\npossible, because men give such a lot of trouble travelling. And then,\nthey must have good lungs and not be always catching cold. Above all,\ntheir clothes must be of good wearing material. Otherwise I shall be\nnursing and stitching and mending all the way; and it will be trouble\nenough, I assure you, to keep them washed and fed without that.\n\nBRASSBOUND (haughtily). My men, madam, are not children in the nursery.\n\nLADY CICELY (with unanswerable conviction). Captain Brassbound: all men\nare children in the nursery. I see that you don't notice things. That\npoor Italian had only one proper bootlace: the other was a bit of\nstring. And I am sure from Mr. Drinkwater's complexion that he ought to\nhave some medicine.\n\nBRASSBOUND (outwardly determined not to be trifled with: inwardly\npuzzled and rather daunted). Madam: if you want an escort, I can provide\nyou with an escort. If you want a Sunday School treat, I can NOT provide\nit.\n\nLADY CICELY (with sweet melancholy). Ah, don't you wish you could,\nCaptain? Oh, if I could only show you my children from Waynflete Sunday\nSchool! The darlings would love this place, with all the camels\nand black men. I'm sure you would enjoy having them here, Captain\nBrassbound; and it would be such an education for your men! (Brassbound\nstares at her with drying lips.)\n\nSIR HOWARD. Cicely: when you have quite done talking nonsense to Captain\nBrassbound, we can proceed to make some definite arrangement with him.\n\nLADY CICELY. But it's arranged already. We'll start at eight o'clock\nto-morrow morning, if you please, Captain. Never mind about the Italian:\nI have a big box of clothes with me for my brother in Rome; and there\nare some bootlaces in it. Now go home to bed and don't fuss yourself.\nAll you have to do is to bring your men round; and I'll see to the rest.\nMen are always so nervous about moving. Goodnight. (She offers him her\nhand. Surprised, he pulls off his cap for the first time. Some scruple\nprevents him from taking her hand at once. He hesitates; then turns to\nSir Howard and addresses him with warning earnestness.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Sir Howard Hallam: I advise you not to attempt this\nexpedition.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Indeed! Why?\n\nBRASSBOUND. You are safe here. I warn you, in those hills there is a\njustice that is not the justice of your courts in England. If you have\nwronged a man, you may meet that man there. If you have wronged a woman,\nyou may meet her son there. The justice of those hills is the justice of\nvengeance.\n\nSIR HOWARD (faintly amused). You are superstitious, Captain. Most\nsailors are, I notice. However, I have complete confidence in your\nescort.\n\nBRASSBOUND (almost threateningly). Take care. The avenger may be one of\nthe escort.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I have already met the only member of your escort who might\nhave borne a grudge against me, Captain; and he was acquitted.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You are fated to come, then?\n\nSIR HOWARD (smiling). It seems so.\n\nBRASSBOUND. On your head be it! (To Lady Cicely, accepting her hand at\nlast) Goodnight.\n\nHe goes. It is by this time starry night.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nMidday. A roam in a Moorish castle. A divan seat runs round the\ndilapidated adobe walls, which are partly painted, partly faced with\nwhite tiles patterned in green and yellow. The ceiling is made up\nof little squares, painted in bright colors, with gilded edges,\nand ornamented with gilt knobs. On the cement floor are mattings,\nsheepskins, and leathern cushions with geometrical patterns on them.\nThere is a tiny Moorish table in the middle; and at it a huge saddle,\nwith saddle cloths of various colors, showing that the room is used by\nforeigners accustomed to chairs. Anyone sitting at the table in this\nseat would have the chief entrance, a large horseshoe arch, on his left,\nand another saddle seat between him and the arch; whilst, if susceptible\nto draughts, he would probably catch cold from a little Moorish door in\nthe wall behind him to his right.\n\nTwo or three of Brassbound's men, overcome by the midday heat, sprawl\nsupine on the floor, with their reefer coats under their heads, their\nknees uplifted, and their calves laid comfortably on the divan. Those\nwho wear shirts have them open at the throat for greater coolness. Some\nhave jerseys. All wear boots and belts, and have guns ready to their\nhands. One of them, lying with his head against the second saddle seat,\nwears what was once a fashionable white English yachting suit. He is\nevidently a pleasantly worthless young English gentleman gone to the\nbad, but retaining sufficient self-respect to shave carefully and\nbrush his hair, which is wearing thin, and does not seem to have been\nluxuriant even in its best days.\n\nThe silence is broken only by the snores of the young gentleman, whose\nmouth has fallen open, until a few distant shots half waken him. He\nshuts his mouth convulsively, and opens his eyes sleepily. A door is\nviolently kicked outside; and the voice of Drinkwater is heard raising\nurgent alarm.\n\nDRINKWATER. Wot ow! Wike ap there, will yr. Wike ap. (He rushes in\nthrough the horseshoe arch, hot and excited, and runs round, kicking the\nsleepers) Nah then. Git ap. Git ap, will yr, Kiddy Redbrook. (He gives\nthe young qentleman a rude shove.)\n\nREDBOOK (sitting up). Stow that, will you. What's amiss?\n\nDRINKWATER (disgusted). Wot's amiss! Didn't eah naow fawrin, I spowse.\n\nREDBROOK. No.\n\nDRINKWATER (sneering). Naow. Thort it sifer nort, didn't yr?\n\nREDBROOK (with crisp intelligence). What! You're running away, are\nyou? (He springs up, crying) Look alive, Johnnies: there's danger.\nBrandyfaced Jack's on the run. (They spring up hastily, grasping their\nguns.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Dineger! Yuss: should think there wors dineger. It's howver,\nthow, as it mowstly his baw the tawm YOU'RE awike. (They relapse\ninto lassitude.) Waw wasn't you on the look-aht to give us a end? Bin\nhattecked baw the Benny Seeras (Beni Siras), we ev, an ed to rawd for it\npretty strite, too, aw teoll yr. Mawtzow is it: the bullet glawnst all\nrahnd is bloomin brisket. Brarsbahnd e dropt the Shike's oss at six\nunnern fifty yawds. (Bustling them about) Nah then: git the plice ready\nfor the British herristoracy, Lawd Ellam and Lidy Wineflete.\n\nREDBOOK. Lady faint, eh?\n\nDRINKWATER. Fynt! Not lawkly. Wornted to gow an talk, to the Benny\nSeeras: blaow me if she didn't! huz wot we was frahtnd of. Tyin up\nMawtzow's wound, she is, like a bloomin orspittle nass. (Sir Howard,\nwith a copious pagri on his white hat, enters through the horseshoe\narch, followed by a couple of men supporting the wounded Marzo, who,\nweeping and terrorstricken by the prospect of death and of subsequent\ntorments for which he is conscious of having eminently qualified\nhimself, has his coat off and a bandage round his chest. One of his\nsupporters is a blackbearded, thickset, slow, middle-aged man with an\nair of damaged respectability, named--as it afterwards appears--Johnson.\nLady Cicely walks beside Marzo. Redbrook, a little shamefaced, crosses\nthe room to the opposite wall as far away as possible from the visitors.\nDrinkwater turns and receives them with jocular ceremony.) Weolcome\nto Brarsbahnd Cawstl, Sr Ahrd an lidy. This eah is the corfee and\ncommercial room.\n\nSir Howard goes to the table and sits on the saddle, rather exhausted.\nLady Cicely comes to Drinkwater.\n\nLADY CICELY. Where is Marzo's bed?\n\nDRINKWATER. Is bed, lidy? Weoll: e ynt petickler, lidy. E ez is chawce\nof henny flegstown agin thet wall.\n\nThey deposit Marzo on the flags against the wall close to the little\ndoor. He groans. Johnson phlegmatically leaves him and joins Redbrook.\n\nLADY CICELY. But you can't leave him there in that state.\n\nDRINKWATER. Ow: e's hall rawt. (Strolling up callously to Marzo) You're\nhall rawt, ynt yer, Mawtzow? (Marzo whimpers.) Corse y'aw.\n\nLADY CICELY (to Sir Howard). Did you ever see such a helpless lot of\npoor creatures? (She makes for the little door.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Eah! (He runs to the door and places himself before it.)\nWhere mawt yr lidyship be gowin?\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm going through every room in this castle to find a\nproper place to put that man. And now I'll tell you where YOU'RE going.\nYou're going to get some water for Marzo, who is very thirsty. And then,\nwhen I've chosen a room for him, you're going to make a bed for him\nthere.\n\nDRINKWATER (sarcastically). Ow! Henny ather little suvvice? Mike yrseolf\nat owm, y' knaow, lidy.\n\nLADY CICELY (considerately). Don't go if you'd rather not, Mr.\nDrinkwater. Perhaps you're too tired. (Turning to the archway) I'll ask\nCaptain Brassbound: he won't mind.\n\nDRINKWATER (terrified, running after her and getting between her and the\narch). Naow, naow! Naow, lidy: doesn't you goes disturbin the Kepn. Awll\nsee to it.\n\nLADY CICELY (gravely). I was sure you would, Mr. Drinkwater. You have\nsuch a kind face. (She turns back and goes out through the small door.)\n\nDRINKWATER (looking after her). Garn!\n\nSIR HOWARD (to Drinkwater). Will you ask one of your friends to show me\nto my room whilst you are getting the water?\n\nDRINKWATER (insolently). Yr room! Ow: this ynt good enaf fr yr, ynt it?\n(Ferociously) Oo a you orderin abaht, ih?\n\nSIR HOWARD (rising quietly, and taking refuge between Redbrook and\nJohnson, whom he addresses). Can you find me a more private room than\nthis?\n\nJOHNSON (shaking his head). I've no orders. You must wait til the capn\ncomes, sir.\n\nDRINKWATER (following Sir Howard). Yuss; an whawl you're witin, yll tike\nyour horders from me: see?\n\nJOHNSON (with slow severity, to Drinkwater). Look here: do you see three\ngenlmen talkin to one another here, civil and private, eh?\n\nDRINKWATER (chapfallen). No offence, Miste Jornsn--\n\nJOHNSON (ominously). Ay; but there is offence. Where's your manners,\nyou guttersnipe? (Turning to Sir Howard) That's the curse o this kind o\nlife, sir: you got to associate with all sorts. My father, sir, was\nCapn Johnson o Hull--owned his own schooner, sir. We're mostly gentlemen\nhere, sir, as you'll find, except the poor ignorant foreigner and\nthat there scum of the submerged tenth. (Contemptuously looking at\nDrinkwater) HE ain't nobody's son: he's only a offspring o coster folk\nor such.\n\nDRINKWATER (bursting into tears). Clawss feelin! thet's wot it is:\nclawss feelin! Wot are yer, arter all, bat a bloomin gang o west cowst\ncazhls (casual ward paupers)? (Johnson is scandalized; and there is a\ngeneral thrill of indignation.) Better ev naow fembly, an rawse aht of\nit, lawk me, than ev a specble one and disgrice it, lawk you.\n\nJOHNSON. Brandyfaced Jack: I name you for conduct and language\nunbecoming to a gentleman. Those who agree will signify the same in the\nusual manner.\n\nALL (vehemently). Aye.\n\nDRINKWATER (wildly). Naow.\n\nJOHNSON. Felix Drinkwater: are you goin out, or are you goin to wait til\nyou're chucked out? You can cry in the passage. If you give any trouble,\nyou'll have something to cry for.\n\nThey make a threatenng movement towards Drinkwater.\n\nDRINKWATER (whimpering). You lee me alown: awm gowin. There's n'maw true\ndemmecrettick feelin eah than there is in the owl bloomin M division of\nNoontn Corzwy coppers (Newington Causeway policemen).\n\nAs he slinks away in tears towards the arch, Brassbound enters.\nDrinkwater promptly shelters himself on the captain's left hand, the\nothers retreating to the opposite side as Brassbound advances to the\nmiddle of the room. Sir Howard retires behind them and seats himself on\nthe divan, much fatigued.\n\nBRASSBOUND (to Drinkwater). What are you snivelling at?\n\nDRINKWATER. You awsk the wust cowst herristorcracy. They fawnds maw\ncornduck hanbecammin to a genlmn.\n\nBrassbound is about to ask Johnson for an explanation, when Lady Cicely\nreturns through the little door, and comes between Brassbound and\nDrinkwater.\n\nLADY CICELY (to Drinkwater). Have you fetched the water?\n\nDRINKWATER. Yuss: nah YOU begin orn me. (He weeps afresh.)\n\nLADY CICELY (surprised). Oh! This won't do, Mr. Drinkwater. If you cry,\nI can't let you nurse your friend.\n\nDRINKWATER (frantic). Thet'll brike maw awt, wown't it nah? (With a\nlamentable sob, he throws himself down on the divan, raging like an\nangry child.)\n\nLADY CICELY (after contemplating him in astonishment for a moment).\nCaptain Brassbound: are there any charwomen in the Atlas Mountains?\n\nBRASSBOUND. There are people here who will work if you pay them, as\nthere are elsewhere.\n\nLADY CICELY. This castle is very romantic, Captain; but it hasn't had a\nspring cleaning since the Prophet lived in it. There's only one room I\ncan put that wounded man into. It's the only one that has a bed in it:\nthe second room on the right out of that passage.\n\nBRASSBOUND (haughtily). That is my room, madam.\n\nLADY CICELY (relieved). Oh, that's all right. It would have been so\nawkward if I had had to ask one of your men to turn out. You won't mind,\nI know. (All the men stare at her. Even Drinkwater forgets his sorrows\nin his stupefaction.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Pray, madam, have you made any arrangements for my\naccommodation?\n\nLADY CICELY (reassuringly). Yes: you can have my room instead wherever\nit may be: I'm sure you chose me a nice one. I must be near my\npatient; and I don't mind roughing it. Now I must have Marzo moved very\ncarefully. Where is that truly gentlemanly Mr. Johnson?--oh, there you\nare, Mr. Johnson. (She runs to Johnson, past Brassbound, who has to step\nback hastily out of her way with every expression frozen out of his face\nexcept one of extreme and indignant dumbfoundedness). Will you ask\nyour strong friend to help you with Marzo: strong people are always so\ngentle.\n\nJOHNSON. Let me introdooce Mr. Redbrook. Your ladyship may know his\nfather, the very Rev. Dean Redbrook. (He goes to Marzo.)\n\nREDBROOK. Happy to oblige you, Lady Cicely.\n\nLADY CICELY (shaking hands). Howdyedo? Of course I knew your\nfather--Dunham, wasn't it? Were you ever called--\n\nREDBROOK. The kid? Yes.\n\nLADY CICELY. But why--\n\nREDBROOK (anticipating the rest of the question). Cards and drink, Lady\nSis. (He follows Johnson to the patient. Lady Cicely goes too.) Now,\nCount Marzo. (Marzo groans as Johnson and Redbrook raise him.)\n\nLADY CICELY. Now they're NOT hurting you, Marzo. They couldn't be more\ngentle.\n\nMARZO. Drink.\n\nLADY CICELY. I'll get you some water myself. Your friend Mr. Drinkwater\nwas too overcome--take care of the corner--that's it--the second door on\nthe right. (She goes out with Marzo and his bearers through the little\ndoor.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (still staring). Well, I AM damned--!\n\nDRINKWATER (getting up). Weoll, blimey!\n\nBRASSBOUND (turning irritably on him). What did you say?\n\nDRINKWATER. Weoll, wot did yer sy yrseolf, kepn? Fust tawm aw yever see\ny' afride of ennybody. (The others laugh.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Afraid!\n\nDRINKWATER (maliciously). She's took y' bed from hander yr for a bloomin\npenny hawcemen. If y' ynt afride, let's eah yer speak ap to er wen she\ncams bawck agin.\n\nBRASSBOUND (to Sir Howard). I wish you to understand, Sir Howard, that\nin this castle, it is I who give orders, and no one else. Will you be\ngood enough to let Lady Cicely Waynflete know that.\n\nSIR HOWARD (sitting up on the divan and pulling himself together). You\nwill have ample opportunity for speaking to Lady Cicely yourself when\nshe returns. (Drinkwater chuckles: and the rest grin.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. My manners are rough, Sir Howard. I have no wish to frighten\nthe lady.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Captain Brassbound: if you can frighten Lady Cicely, you\nwill confer a great obligation on her family. If she had any sense of\ndanger, perhaps she would keep out of it.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Well, sir, if she were ten Lady Cicelys, she must consult me\nwhile she is here.\n\nDRINKWATER. Thet's rawt, kepn. Let's eah you steblish yr hawthority.\n(Brassbound turns impatiently on him: He retreats remonstrating) Nah,\nnah, nah!\n\nSIR HOWARD. If you feel at all nervous, Captain Brassbound, I will\nmention the matter with pleasure.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Nervous, sir! no. Nervousness is not in my line. You\nwill find me perfectly capable of saying what I want to say--with\nconsiderable emphasis, if necessary. (Sir Howard assents with a polite\nbut incredulous nod.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Eah, eah!\n\nLady Cicely returns with Johnson and Redbrook. She carries a jar.\n\nLADY CICELY (stopping between the door and the arch). Now for the water.\nWhere is it?\n\nREDBROOK. There's a well in the courtyard. I'll come and work the\nbucket.\n\nLADY CICELY. So good of you, Mr. Redbrook. (She makes for the horseshoe\narch, followed by Redbrook.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Nah, Kepn Brassbound: you got sathink to sy to the lidy, ynt\nyr?\n\nLADY CICELY (stopping). I'll come back to hear it presently, Captain.\nAnd oh, while I remember it (coming forward between Brassbound and\nDrinkwater), do please tell me Captain, if I interfere with your\narrangements in any way. It I disturb you the least bit in the world,\nstop me at once. You have all the responsibility; and your comfort and\nyour authority must be the first thing. You'll tell me, won't you?\n\nBRASSBOUND (awkwardly, quite beaten). Pray do as you please, madam.\n\nLADY CICELY. Thank you. That's so like you, Captain. Thank you. Now, Mr.\nRedbrook! Show me the way to the well. (She follows Redbrook out through\nthe arch.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Yah! Yah! Shime! Beat baw a woman!\n\nJOHNSON (coming forward on Brassbound's right). What's wrong now?\n\nDRINKWATER (with an air of disappointment and disillusion). Down't awsk\nme, Miste Jornsn. The kepn's naow clawss arter all.\n\nBRASSBOUND (a little shamefacedly). What has she been fixing up in\nthere, Johnson?\n\nJOHNSON. Well: Marzo's in your bed. Lady wants to make a kitchen of\nthe Sheikh's audience chamber, and to put me and the Kid handy in his\nbedroom in case Marzo gets erysipelas and breaks out violent. From what\nI can make out, she means to make herself matron of this institution. I\nspose it's all right, isn't it?\n\nDRINKWATER. Yuss, an horder huz abaht as if we was keb tahts! An the\nkepn afride to talk bawck at er!\n\nLady Cicely returns with Redbrook. She carries the jar full of water.\n\nLADY CICELY (putting down the jar, and coming between Brassbound and\nDrinkwater as before). And now, Captain, before I go to poor Marzo, what\nhave you to say to me?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I! Nothing.\n\nDRINKWATER. Down't fank it, gavner. Be a men!\n\nLADY CICELY (looking at Drinkwater, puzzled). Mr. Drinkwater said you\nhad.\n\nBRASSBOUND (recovering himself). It was only this. That fellow there\n(pointing to Drinkwater) is subject to fits of insolence. If he is\nimpertinent to your ladyship, or disobedient, you have my authority to\norder him as many kicks as you think good for him; and I will see that\nhe gets them.\n\nDRINKWATER (lifting up his voice in protest). Nah, nah--\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, I couldn't think of such a thing, Captain Brassbound. I\nam sure it would hurt Mr. Drinkwater.\n\nDRINKWATER (lachrymosely). Lidy's hinkyp'ble o sich bawbrous usage.\n\nLADY CICELY. But there's one thing I SHOULD like, if Mr. Drinkwater\nwon't mind my mentioning it. It's so important if he's to attend on\nMarzo.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What is that?\n\nLADY CICELY. Well--you WON'T mind, Mr. Drinkwater, will you?\n\nDRINKWATER (suspiciously). Wot is it?\n\nLADY CICELY. There would be so much less danger of erysipelas if you\nwould be so good as to take a bath.\n\nDRINKWATER (aghast). A bawth!\n\nBRASSBOUND (in tones of command). Stand by, all hands. (They stand by.)\nTake that man and wash him. (With a roar of laughter they seize him.)\n\nDRINKWATER (in an agony of protest). Naow, naow. Look eah--\n\nBRASSBOUND (ruthlessly). In COLD water.\n\nDRINKWATER (shrieking). Na-a-a-a-ow. Aw eawn't, aw toel yer. Naow. Aw\nsy, look eah. Naow, naow, naow, naow, naow, NAOW!!!\n\nHe is dragged away through the arch in a whirlwind of laughter, protests\nand tears.\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm afraid he isn't used to it, poor fellow; but REALLY it\nwill do him good, Captain Brassbound. Now I must be off to my patient.\n(She takes up her jar and goes out by the little door, leaving\nBrassbound and Sir Howard alone together.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (rising). And now, Captain Brass--\n\nBRASSBOUND (cutting him short with a fierce contempt that astonishes\nhim). I will attend to you presently. (Calling) Johnson. Send me Johnson\nthere. And Osman. (He pulls off his coat and throws it on the table,\nstanding at his ease in his blue jersey.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (after a momentary flush of anger, with a controlled force\nthat compels Brassbound's attention in spite of himself). You seem to be\nin a strong position with reference to these men of yours.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I am in a strong position with reference to everyone in this\ncastle.\n\nSIR HOWARD (politely but threateningly). I have just been noticing that\nyou think so. I do not agree with you. Her Majesty's Government, Captain\nBrassbound, has a strong arm and a long arm. If anything disagreeable\nhappens to me or to my sister-in-law, that arm will be stretched out. If\nthat happens you will not be in a strong position. Excuse my reminding\nyou of it.\n\nBRASSBOUND (grimly). Much good may it do you! (Johnson comes in through\nthe arch.) Where is Osman, the Sheikh's messenger? I want him too.\n\nJOHNSON. Coming, Captain. He had a prayer to finish.\n\nOsman, a tall, skinny, whiteclad, elderly Moor, appears in the archway.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Osman Ali (Osman comes forward between Brassbound and\nJohnson): you have seen this unbeliever (indicating Sir Howard) come in\nwith us?\n\nOSMAN. Yea, and the shameless one with the naked face, who flattered my\ncountenance and offered me her hand.\n\nJOHNSON. Yes; and you took it too, Johnny, didn't you?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Take horse, then; and ride fast to your master the Sheikh\nSidi el Assif.\n\nOSMAN (proudly). Kinsman to the Prophet.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Tell him what you have seen here. That is all. Johnson: give\nhim a dollar; and note the hour of his going, that his master may know\nhow fast he rides.\n\nOSMAN. The believer's word shall prevail with Allah and his servant Sidi\nel Assif.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Off with you.\n\nOSMAN. Make good thy master's word ere I go out from his presence, O\nJohnson el Hull.\n\nJOHNSON. He wants the dollar.\n\nBrassbound gives Osman a coin.\n\nOSMAN (bowing). Allah will make hell easy for the friend of Sidi el\nAssif and his servant. (He goes out through the arch.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (to Johnson). Keep the men out of this until the Sheikh\ncomes. I have business to talk over. When he does come, we must keep\ntogether all: Sidi el Assif's natural instinct will be to cut every\nChristian throat here.\n\nJOHNSON. We look to you, Captain, to square him, since you invited him\nover.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You can depend on me; and you know it, I think.\n\nJOHNSON (phlegmatically). Yes: we know it. (He is going out when Sir\nHoward speaks.)\n\nSIR HOWARD. You know also, Mr. Johnson, I hope, that you can depend on\nME.\n\nJOHNSON (turning). On YOU, sir?\n\nSIR HOWARD. Yes: on me. If my throat is cut, the Sultan of Morocco may\nsend Sidi's head with a hundred thousand dollars blood-money to the\nColonial Office; but it will not be enough to save his kingdom--any more\nthan it would saw your life, if your Captain here did the same thing.\n\nJOHNSON (struck). Is that so, Captain?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I know the gentleman's value--better perhaps than he knows\nit himself. I shall not lose sight of it.\n\nJohnson nods gravely, and is going out when Lady Cicely returns softly\nby the little door and calls to him in a whisper. She has taken off her\ntravelling things and put on an apron. At her chatelaine is a case of\nsewing materials.\n\nLADY CICELY. Mr. Johnson. (He turns.) I've got Marzo to sleep. Would you\nmind asking the gentlemen not to make a noise under his window in the\ncourtyard.\n\nJOHNSON. Right, maam. (He goes out.)\n\nLady Cicely sits down at the tiny table, and begins stitching at a sling\nbandage for Marzo's arm. Brassbound walks up and down on her right,\nmuttering to himself so ominously that Sir Howard quietly gets out of\nhis way by crossing to the other side and sitting down on the second\nsaddle seat.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Are you yet able to attend to me for a moment, Captain\nBrassbound?\n\nBRASSBOUND (still walking about). What do you want?\n\nSIR HOWARD. Well, I am afraid I want a little privacy, and, if you will\nallow me to say so, a little civility. I am greatly obliged to you for\nbringing us safely off to-day when we were attacked. So far, you have\ncarried out your contract. But since we have been your guests here,\nyour tone and that of the worst of your men has changed--intentionally\nchanged, I think.\n\nBRASSBOUND (stopping abruptly and flinging the announcement at him). You\nare not my guest: you are my prisoner.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Prisoner!\n\nLady Cicely, after a single glance up, continues stitching, apparently\nquite unconcerned.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I warned you. You should have taken my warning.\n\nSIR HOWARD (immediately taking the tone of cold disgust for moral\ndelinquency). Am I to understand, then, that you are a brigand? Is this\na matter of ransom?\n\nBRASSBOUND (with unaccountable intensity). All the wealth of England\nshall not ransom you.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Then what do you expect to gain by this?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Justice on a thief and a murderer.\n\nLady Cicely lays down her work and looks up anxiously.\n\nSIR HOWARD (deeply outraged, rising with venerable dignity). Sir: do you\napply those terms to me?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I do. (He turns to Lady Cicely, and adds, pointing\ncontemptuously to Sir Howard) Look at him. You would not take this\nvirtuously indignant gentleman for the uncle of a brigand, would you?\n\nSir Howard starts. The shock is too much for him: he sits down again,\nlooking very old; and his hands tremble; but his eyes and mouth are\nintrepid, resolute, and angry.\n\nLADY CICELY. Uncle! What do you mean?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Has he never told you about my mother? this fellow who puts\non ermine and scarlet and calls himself Justice.\n\nSIR HOWARD (almost voiceless). You are the son of that woman!\n\nBRASSBOUND (fiercely). \"That woman!\" (He makes a movement as if to rush\nat Sir Howard.)\n\nLADY CICELY (rising quickly and putting her hand on his arm). Take care.\nYou mustn't strike an old man.\n\nBRASSBOUND (raging). He did not spare my mother--\"that woman,\" he\ncalls her--because of her sex. I will not spare him because of his age.\n(Lowering his tone to one of sullen vindictiveness) But I am not going\nto strike him. (Lady Cicely releases him, and sits down, much perplexed.\nBrassbound continues, with an evil glance at Sir Howard) I shall do no\nmore than justice.\n\nSIR HOWARD (recovering his voice and vigor). Justice! I think you mean\nvengeance, disguised as justice by your passions.\n\nBRASSBOUND. To many and many a poor wretch in the dock YOU have brought\nvengeance in that disguise--the vengeance of society, disguised as\njustice by ITS passions. Now the justice you have outraged meets you\ndisguised as vengeance. How do you like it?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I shall meet it, I trust, as becomes an innocent man and an\nupright judge. What do you charge against me?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I charge you with the death of my mother and the theft of my\ninheritance.\n\nSIR HOWARD. As to your inheritance, sir, it was yours whenever you came\nforward to claim it. Three minutes ago I did not know of your existence.\nI affirm that most solemnly. I never knew--never dreamt--that my brother\nMiles left a son. As to your mother, her case was a hard one--perhaps\nthe hardest that has come within even my experience. I mentioned it, as\nsuch, to Mr. Rankin, the missionary, the evening we met you. As to her\ndeath, you know--you MUST know--that she died in her native country,\nyears after our last meeting. Perhaps you were too young to know that\nshe could hardly have expected to live long.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You mean that she drank.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I did not say so. I do not think she was always accountable\nfor what she did.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Yes: she was mad too; and whether drink drove her to madness\nor madness drove her to drink matters little. The question is, who drove\nher to both?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I presume the dishonest agent who seized her estate did. I\nrepeat, it was a hard case--a frightful injustice. But it could not be\nremedied.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You told her so. When she would not take that false answer\nyou drove her from your doors. When she exposed you in the street and\nthreatened to take with her own hands the redress the law denied her,\nyou had her imprisoned, and forced her to write you an apology and\nleave the country to regain her liberty and save herself from a lunatic\nasylum. And when she was gone, and dead, and forgotten, you found for\nyourself the remedy you could not find for her. You recovered the estate\neasily enough then, robber and rascal that you are. Did he tell the\nmissionary that, Lady Cicely, eh?\n\nLADY CICELY (sympathetically). Poor woman! (To Sir Howard) Couldn't you\nhave helped her, Howard?\n\nSIR HOWARD. No. This man may be ignorant enough to suppose that when\nI was a struggling barrister I could do everything I did when I was\nAttorney General. You know better. There is some excuse for his mother.\nShe was an uneducated Brazilian, knowing nothing of English society, and\ndriven mad by injustice.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Your defence--\n\nSIR HOWARD (interrupting him determinedly). I do not defend myself. I\ncall on you to obey the law.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I intend to do so. The law of the Atlas Mountains is\nadministered by the Sheikh Sidi el Assif. He will be here within an\nhour. He is a judge like yourself. You can talk law to him. He will give\nyou both the law and the prophets.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Does he know what the power of England is?\n\nBRASSBOUND. He knows that the Mahdi killed my master Gordon, and that\nthe Mahdi died in his bed and went to paradise.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Then he knows also that England's vengeance was on the\nMahdi's track.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Ay, on the track of the railway from the Cape to Cairo. Who\nare you, that a nation should go to war for you? If you are missing,\nwhat will your newspapers say? A foolhardy tourist. What will your\nlearned friends at the bar say? That it was time for you to make room\nfor younger and better men. YOU a national hero! You had better find\na goldfield in the Atlas Mountains. Then all the governments of Europe\nwill rush to your rescue. Until then, take care of yourself; for you are\ngoing to see at last the hypocrisy in the sanctimonious speech of the\njudge who is sentencing you, instead of the despair in the white face of\nthe wretch you are recommending to the mercy of your God.\n\nSIR HOWARD (deeply and personally offended by this slight to his\nprofession, and for the first time throwing away his assumed dignity\nand rising to approach Brassbound with his fists clenched; so that Lady\nCicely lifts one eye from her work to assure herself that the table is\nbetween them). I have no more to say to you, sir. I am not afraid\nof you, nor of any bandit with whom you may be in league. As to your\nproperty, it is ready for you as soon as you come to your senses and\nclaim it as your father's heir. Commit a crime, and you will become\nan outlaw, and not only lose the property, but shut the doors of\ncivilization against yourself for ever.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I will not sell my mother's revenge for ten properties.\n\nLADY CICELY (placidly). Besides, really, Howard, as the property now\ncosts 150 pounds a year to keep up instead of bringing in anything, I am\nafraid it would not be of much use to him. (Brassbound stands amazed at\nthis revelation.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (taken aback). I must say, Cicely, I think you might have\nchosen a more suitable moment to mention that fact.\n\nBRASSBOUND (with disgust). Agh! Trickster! Lawyer! Even the price you\noffer for your life is to be paid in false coin. (Calling) Hallo there!\nJohnson! Redbrook! Some of you there! (To Sir Howard) You ask for a\nlittle privacy: you shall have it. I will not endure the company of such\na fellow--\n\nSIR HOWARD (very angry, and full of the crustiest pluck). You insult me,\nsir. You are a rascal. You are a rascal.\n\nJohnson, Redbrook, and a few others come in through the arch.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Take this man away.\n\nJOHNSON. Where are we to put him?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Put him where you please so long as you can find him when he\nis wanted.\n\nSIR HOWARD. You will be laid by the heels yet, my friend.\n\nREDBROOK (with cheerful tact). Tut tut, Sir Howard: what's the use of\ntalking back? Come along: we'll make you comfortable.\n\nSir Howard goes out through the arch between Johnson and Redbrook,\nmuttering wrathfully. The rest, except Brassbound and Lady Cicely,\nfollow.\n\nBrassbound walks up and down the room, nursing his indignation. In doing\nso he unconsciously enters upon an unequal contest with Lady Cicely, who\nsits quietly stitching. It soon becomes clear that a tranquil woman\ncan go on sewing longer than an angry man can go on fuming. Further, it\nbegins to dawn on Brassbound's wrath-blurred perception that Lady Cicely\nhas at some unnoticed stage in the proceedings finished Marzo's bandage,\nand is now stitching a coat. He stops; glances at his shirtsleeves;\nfinally realizes the situation.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What are you doing there, madam?\n\nLADY CICELY. Mending your coat, Captain Brassbound.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I have no recollection of asking you to take that trouble.\n\nLADY CICELY. No: I don't suppose you even knew it was torn. Some men\nare BORN untidy. You cannot very well receive Sidi el--what's his\nname?--with your sleeve half out.\n\nBRASSBOUND (disconcerted). I--I don't know how it got torn.\n\nLADY CICELY. You should not get virtuously indignant with people. It\nbursts clothes more than anything else, Mr. Hallam.\n\nBRASSBOUND (flushing, quickly). I beg you will not call me Mr. Hallam. I\nhate the name.\n\nLADY CICELY. Black Paquito is your pet name, isn't it?\n\nBRASSBOUND (huffily). I am not usually called so to my face.\n\nLADY CICELY (turning the coat a little). I'm so sorry. (She takes\nanother piece of thread and puts it into her needle, looking placidly\nand reflectively upward meanwhile.) Do you know, You are wonderfully\nlike your uncle.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Damnation!\n\nLADY CICELY. Eh?\n\nBRASSBOUND. If I thought my veins contained a drop of his black blood,\nI would drain them empty with my knife. I have no relations. I had a\nmother: that was all.\n\nLADY CICELY (unconvinced) I daresay you have your mother's complexion.\nBut didn't you notice Sir Howard's temper, his doggedness, his high\nspirit: above all, his belief in ruling people by force, as you rule\nyour men; and in revenge and punishment, just as you want to revenge\nyour mother? Didn't you recognize yourself in that?\n\nBRASSBOUND (startled). Myself!--in that!\n\nLADY CECILY (returning to the tailoring question as if her last remark\nwere of no consequence whatever). Did this sleeve catch you at all under\nthe arm? Perhaps I had better make it a little easier for you.\n\nBRASSBOUND (irritably). Let my coat alone. It will do very well as it\nis. Put it down.\n\nLADY CICILY. Oh, don't ask me to sit doing nothing. It bores me so.\n\nBRASSBOUND. In Heaven's name then, do what you like! Only don't worry me\nwith it.\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm so sorry. All the Hallams are irritable.\n\nBRASSBOUND (penning up his fury with difficulty). As I have already\nsaid, that remark has no application to me.\n\nLADY CICELY (resuming her stitching). That's so funny! They all hate to\nbe told that they are like one another.\n\nBRASSBOUND (with the beginnings of despair in his voice). Why did you\ncome here? My trap was laid for him, not for you. Do you know the danger\nyou are in?\n\nLADY CICELY. There's always a danger of something or other. Do you think\nit's worth bothering about?\n\nBRASSBOUND (scolding her). Do I THINK! Do you think my coat's worth\nmending?\n\nLADY CICELY (prosaically). Oh yes: it's not so far gone as that.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Have you any feeling? Or are you a fool?\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm afraid I'm a dreadful fool. But I can't help it. I was\nmade so, I suppose.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Perhaps you don't realize that your friend my good uncle\nwill be pretty fortunate if he is allowed to live out his life as a\nslave with a set of chains on him?\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, I don't know about that, Mr. H--I mean Captain\nBrassbound. Men are always thinking that they are going to do something\ngrandly wicked to their enemies; but when it comes to the point, really\nbad men are just as rare as really good ones.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You forget that I am like my uncle, according to you. Have\nyou any doubt as to the reality of HIS badness?\n\nLADY CICELY. Bless me! your uncle Howard is one of the most harmless\nof men--much nicer than most professional people. Of course he does\ndreadful things as a judge; but then if you take a man and pay him 5,000\npounds a year to be wicked, and praise him for it, and have policemen\nand courts and laws and juries to drive him into it so that he can't\nhelp doing it, what can you expect? Sir Howard's all right when he's\nleft to himself. We caught a burglar one night at Waynflete when he was\nstaying with us; and I insisted on his locking the poor man up until the\npolice came, in a room with a window opening on the lawn. The man came\nback next day and said he must return to a life of crime unless I gave\nhim a job in the garden; and I did. It was much more sensible than\ngiving him ten years penal servitude: Howard admitted it. So you see\nhe's not a bit bad really.\n\nBRASSBOUND. He had a fellow feeling for a thief, knowing he was a thief\nhimself. Do you forget that he sent my mother to prison?\n\nLADY CICELY (softly). Were you very fond of your poor mother, and always\nvery good to her?\n\nBRASSBOUND (rather taken aback). I was not worse than other sons, I\nsuppose.\n\nLADY CICELY (opening her eyes very widely). Oh! Was THAT all?\n\nBRASSBOUND (exculpating himself, full of gloomy remembrances). You don't\nunderstand. It was not always possible to be very tender with my mother.\nShe had unfortunately a very violent temper; and she--she--\n\nLADY CICELY. Yes: so you told Howard. (With genuine pity for him) You\nmust have had a very unhappy childhood.\n\nBRASSBOUND (grimily). Hell. That was what my childhood was. Hell.\n\nLADY CICELY. Do you think she would really have killed Howard, as she\nthreatened, if he hadn't sent her to prison?\n\nBRASSBOUND (breaking out again, with a growing sense of being morally\ntrapped). What if she did? Why did he rob her? Why did he not help her\nto get the estate, as he got it for himself afterwards?\n\nLADY CICELY. He says he couldn't, you know. But perhaps the real reason\nwas that he didn't like her. You know, don't you, that if you don't like\npeople you think of all the reasons for not helping them, and if you\nlike them you think of all the opposite reasons.\n\nBRASSBOUND. But his duty as a brother!\n\nLADY CICELY. Are you going to do your duty as a nephew?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Don't quibble with me. I am going to do my duty as a son;\nand you know it.\n\nLADY CICELY. But I should have thought that the time for that was in\nyour mother's lifetime, when you could have been kind and forbearing\nwith her. Hurting your uncle won't do her any good, you know.\n\nBRASSBOUND. It will teach other scoundrels to respect widows and\norphans. Do you forget that there is such a thing as justice?\n\nLADY CICELY (gaily shaking out the finished coat). Oh, if you are going\nto dress yourself in ermine and call yourself Justice, I give you up.\nYou are just your uncle over again; only he gets \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year for it,\nand you do it for nothing.\n\n(She holds the coat up to see whether any further repairs are needed.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (sulkily). You twist my words very cleverly. But no man or\nwoman has ever changed me.\n\nLADY CICELY. Dear me! That must be very nice for the people you deal\nwith, because they can always depend on you; but isn't it rather\ninconvenient for yourself when you change your mind?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I never change my mind.\n\nLADY CICELY (rising with the coat in her hands). Oh! Oh!! Nothing will\never persuade me that you are as pigheaded as that.\n\nBRASSBOUND (offended). Pigheaded!\n\nLADY CICELY (with quick, caressing apology). No, no, no. I didn't mean\nthat. Firm! Unalterable! Resolute! Ironwilled! Stonewall Jackson! That's\nthe idea, isn't it?\n\nBRASSBOUND (hopelessly). You are laughing at me.\n\nLADY CICELY. No: trembling, I assure you. Now will you try this on for\nme: I'm SO afraid I have made it too tight under the arm. (She holds it\nbehind him.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (obeying mechanically). You take me for a fool I think. (He\nmisses the sleeve.)\n\nLADY CICELY. No: all men look foolish when they are feeling for their\nsleeves.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Agh! (He turns and snatches the coat from her; then puts it\non himself and buttons the lowest button.)\n\nLADY CICELY (horrified). Stop. No. You must NEVER pull a coat at the\nskirts, Captain Brassbound: it spoils the sit of it. Allow me. (She\npulls the lappels of his coat vigorously forward) Put back your\nshoulders. (He frowns, but obeys.) That's better. (She buttons the top\nbutton.) Now button the rest from the top down. DOES it catch you at all\nunder the arm?\n\nBRASSBOUND (miserably--all resistance beaten out of him). No.\n\nLADY CICELY. That's right. Now before I go back to poor Marzo, say thank\nyou to me for mending your jacket, like a nice polite sailor.\n\nBRASSBOUND (sitting down at the table in great agitation). Damn you!\nyou have belittled my whole life to me. (He bows his head on his hands,\nconvulsed.)\n\nLADY CICELY (quite understanding, and putting her hand kindly on his\nshoulder). Oh no. I am sure you have done lots of kind things and brave\nthings, if you could only recollect them. With Gordon for instance?\nNobody can belittle that.\n\nHe looks up at her for a moment; then kisses her hand. She presses his\nand turns away with her eyes so wet that she sees Drinkwater, coming in\nthrough the arch just then, with a prismatic halo round him. Even when\nshe sees him clearly, she hardly recognizes him; for he is ludicrously\nclean and smoothly brushed; and his hair, formerly mud color, is now a\nlively red.\n\nDRINKWATER. Look eah, kepn. (Brassbound springs up and recovers himself\nquickly.) Eahs the bloomin Shike jest appeahd on the orawzn wiv abaht\nfifty men. Thy'll be eah insawd o ten minnits, they will.\n\nLADY CICELY. The Sheikh!\n\nBRASSBOUND. Sidi el Assif and fifty men! (To Lady Cicely) You were too\nlate: I gave you up my vengeance when it was no longer in my hand. (To\nDrinkwater) Call all hands to stand by and shut the gates. Then all here\nto me for orders; and bring the prisoner.\n\nDRINKWATER. Rawt, kepn. (He runs out.)\n\nLADY CICELY. Is there really any danger for Howard?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Yes. Danger for all of us unless I keep to my bargain with\nthis fanatic.\n\nLADY CICELY. What bargain?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I pay him so much a head for every party I escort through to\nthe interior. In return he protects me and lets my caravans alone. But\nI have sworn an oath to him to take only Jews and true believers--no\nChristians, you understand.\n\nLADY CICELY. Then why did you take us?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I took my uncle on purpose--and sent word to Sidi that he\nwas here.\n\nLADY CICELY. Well, that's a pretty kettle of fish, isn't it?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I will do what I can to save him--and you. But I fear my\nrepentance has come too late, as repentance usually does.\n\nLADY CICELY (cheerfully). Well, I must go and look after Marzo, at all\nevents. (She goes out through the little door. Johnson, Redbrook and the\nrest come in through the arch, with Sir Howard, still very crusty and\ndetermined. He keeps close to Johnson, who comes to Brassbound's right,\nRedbrook taking the other side.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Where's Drinkwater?\n\nJOHNSON. On the lookout. Look here, Capn: we don't half like this job.\nThe gentleman has been talking to us a bit; and we think that he IS a\ngentleman, and talks straight sense.\n\nREDBROOK. Righto, Brother Johnson. (To Brassbound) Won't do, governor.\nNot good enough.\n\nBRASSBOUND (fiercely). Mutiny, eh?\n\nREDBROOK. Not at all, governor. Don't talk Tommy rot with Brother Sidi\nonly five minutes gallop off. Can't hand over an Englishman to a nigger\nto have his throat cut.\n\nBRASSBOUND (unexpectedly acquiescing). Very good. You know, I suppose,\nthat if you break my bargain with Sidi, you'll have to defend this place\nand fight for your lives in five minutes. That can't be done without\ndiscipline: you know that too. I'll take my part with the rest under\nwhatever leader you are willing to obey. So choose your captain and look\nsharp about it. (Murmurs of surprise and discontent.)\n\nVOICES. No, no. Brassbound must command.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You're wasting your five minutes. Try Johnson.\n\nJOHNSON. No. I haven't the head for it.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Well, Redbrook.\n\nREDBROOK. Not this Johnny, thank you. Haven't character enough.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Well, there's Sir Howard Hallam for You! HE has character\nenough.\n\nA VOICE. He's too old.\n\nALL. No, no. Brassbound, Brassbound.\n\nJOHNSON. There's nobody but you, Captain.\n\nREDRROOK. The mutiny's over, governor. You win, hands down.\n\nBRASSBOUND (turning on them). Now listen, you, all of you. If I am to\ncommand here, I am going to do what I like, not what you like. I'll give\nthis gentleman here to Sidi or to the devil if I choose. I'll not be\nintimidated or talked back to. Is that understood?\n\nREDBROOK (diplomatically). He's offered a present of five hundred quid\nif he gets safe back to Mogador, governor. Excuse my mentioning it.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Myself AND Lady Cicely.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What! A judge compound a felony! You greenhorns, he is more\nlikely to send you all to penal servitude if you are fools enough to\ngive him the chance.\n\nVOICES. So he would. Whew! (Murmurs of conviction.)\n\nREDBROOK. Righto, governor. That's the ace of trumps.\n\nBRASSBOUND (to Sir Howard). Now, have you any other card to play? Any\nother bribe? Any other threat? Quick. Time presses.\n\nSIR HOWARD. My life is in the hands of Providence. Do your worst.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Or my best. I still have that choice.\n\nDRINKWATER (running in). Look eah, kepn. Eah's anather lot cammin from\nthe sahth heast. Hunnerds of em, this tawm. The owl dezzit is lawk a\nbloomin Awd Pawk demonstrition. Aw blieve it's the Kidy from Kintorfy.\n(General alarm. All look to Brassbound.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (eagerly). The Cadi! How far off?\n\nDRINKWATER. Matter o two mawl.\n\nBRASSBOUND. We're saved. Open the gates to the Sheikh.\n\nDRINKWATER (appalled, almost in tears). Naow, naow. Lissn, kepn\n(Pointing to Sir Howard): e'll give huz fawv unnerd red uns. (To the\nothers) Ynt yer spowk to im, Miste Jornsn--Miste Redbrook--\n\nBRASSBOUND (cutting him short). Now then, do you understand plain\nEnglish? Johnson and Redbrook: take what men you want and open the gates\nto the Sheikh. Let him come straight to me. Look alive, will you.\n\nJOHNSON. Ay ay, sir.\n\nREDBROOK. Righto, governor.\n\nThey hurry out, with a few others. Drinkwater stares after them,\ndumbfounded by their obedience.\n\nBRASSBOUND (taking out a pistol). You wanted to sell me to my prisoner,\ndid you, you dog.\n\nDRINKWATER (falling on his knees with a yell). Naow! (Brassbound turns\non him as if to kick him. He scrambles away and takes refuge behind Sir\nHoward.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Sir Howard Hallam: you have one chance left. The Cadi of\nKintafi stands superior to the Sheikh as the responsible governor of the\nwhole province. It is the Cadi who will be sacrificed by the Sultan if\nEngland demands satisfaction for any injury to you. If we can hold the\nSheikh in parley until the Cadi arrives, you may frighten the Cadi into\nforcing the Sheikh to release you. The Cadi's coming is a lucky chance\nfor YOU.\n\nSIR HOWARD. If it were a real chance, you would not tell me of it. Don't\ntry to play cat and mouse with me, man.\n\nDRINKWATER (aside to Sir Howard, as Brassbound turns contemptuously away\nto the other side of the room). It ynt mach of a chawnst, Sr Ahrd. But\nif there was a ganbowt in Mogador Awbr, awd put a bit on it, aw would.\n\nJohnson, Redbrook, and the others return, rather mistrustfully ushering\nin Sidi el Assif, attended by Osman and a troop of Arabs. Brassbound's\nmen keep together on the archway side, backing their captain. Sidi's\nfollowers cross the room behind the table and assemble near Sir Howard,\nwho stands his ground. Drinkwater runs across to Brassbound and stands\nat his elbow as he turns to face Sidi.\n\nSidi el Aasif, clad in spotless white, is a nobly handsome Arab, hardly\nthirty, with fine eyes, bronzed complexion, and instinctively dignified\ncarriage. He places himself between the two groups, with Osman in\nattendance at his right hand.\n\nOSMAN (pointing out Sir Howard). This is the infidel Cadi. (Sir Howard\nbows to Sidi, but, being an infidel, receives only the haughtiest stare\nin acknowledgement.) This (pointing to Brassbound) is Brassbound the\nFranguestani captain, the servant of Sidi.\n\nDRINKWATER (not to be outdone, points out the Sheikh and Osman to\nBrassbound). This eah is the Commawnder of the Fythful an is Vizzeer\nRosman.\n\nSIDI. Where is the woman?\n\nOSMAN. The shameless one is not here.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Sidi el Assif, kinsman of the Prophet: you are welcome.\n\nREDBROOK (with much aplomb). There is no majesty and no might save in\nAllah, the Glorious, the Great!\n\nDRINKWATER. Eah, eah!\n\nOSMAN (to Sidi). The servant of the captain makes his profession of\nfaith as a true believer.\n\nSIDI. It is well.\n\nBRASSBOUND (aside to Redbrook). Where did you pick that up?\n\nREDRROOK (aside to Brassbound). Captain Burton's Arabian Nights--copy in\nthe library of the National Liberal Club.\n\nLADY CICELY (calling without). Mr. Drinkwater. Come and help me with\nMarzo. (The Sheikh pricks up his ears. His nostrils and eyes expand.)\n\nOSMAN. The shameless one!\n\nBRASSBOUND (to Drinkwater, seizing him by the collar and slinging him\ntowards the door). Off with you.\n\nDrinkwater goes out through the little door.\n\nOSMAN. Shall we hide her face before she enters?\n\nSIDI. NO.\n\nLady Cicely, who has resumed her travelling equipment, and has her hat\nslung across her arm, comes through the little door supporting Marzo,\nwho is very white, but able to get about. Drinkwater has his other arm.\nRedbrook hastens to relieve Lady Cicely of Marzo, taking him into the\ngroup behind Brassbound. Lady Cicely comes forward between Brassbound\nand the Sheikh, to whom she turns affably.\n\nLADY CICELY (proffering her hand). Sidi el Assif, isn't it? How dye do?\n(He recoils, blushing somewhat.)\n\nOSMAN (scandalized). Woman; touch not the kinsman of the Prophet.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, I see. I'm being presented at court. Very good. (She\nmakes a presentation curtsey.)\n\nREDBROOK. Sidi el Assif: this is one of the mighty women Sheikhs of\nFranguestan. She goes unveiled among Kings; and only princes may touch\nher hand.\n\nLADY CICELY. Allah upon thee, Sidi el Assif! Be a good little Sheikh,\nand shake hands.\n\nSIDI (timidly touching her hand). Now this is a wonderful thing, and\nworthy to be chronicled with the story of Solomon and the Queen of\nSheba. Is it not so, Osman Ali?\n\nOSMAN. Allah upon thee, master! it is so.\n\nSIDI. Brassbound Ali: the oath of a just man fulfils itself without many\nwords. The infidel Cadi, thy captive, falls to my share.\n\nBRASSBOUND (firmly). It cannot be, Sidi el Assif. (Sidi's brows contract\ngravely.) The price of his blood will be required of our lord the\nSultan. I will take him to Morocco and deliver him up there.\n\nSIDI (impressively). Brassbound: I am in mine own house and amid mine\nown people. I am the Sultan here. Consider what you say; for when my\nword goes forth for life or death, it may not be recalled.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Sidi el Assif: I will buy the man from you at what price you\nchoose to name; and if I do not pay faithfully, you shall take my head\nfor his.\n\nSIDI. It is well. You shall keep the man, and give me the woman in\npayment.\n\nSIR HOWARD AND BRASSBOUND (with the same impulse). No, no.\n\nLADY CICELY (eagerly). Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Sidi. Certainly.\n\nSidi smiles gravely.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Impossible.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You don't know what you're doing.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, don't I? I've not crossed Africa and stayed with six\ncannibal chiefs for nothing. (To the Sheikh) It's all right, Mr. Sidi: I\nshall be delighted.\n\nSIR HOWARD. You are mad. Do you suppose this man will treat you as a\nEuropean gentleman would?\n\nLADY CICELY. No: he'll treat me like one of Nature's gentlemen: look at\nhis perfectly splendid face! (Addressing Osman as if he were her oldest\nand most attached retainer.) Osman: be sure you choose me a good horse;\nand get a nice strong camel for my luggage.\n\nOsman, after a moment of stupefaction, hurries out. Lady Cicely puts\non her hat and pins it to her hair, the Sheikh gazing at her during the\nprocess with timid admiration.\n\nDRINKWATER (chuckling). She'll mawch em all to church next Sunder lawk a\nbloomin lot o' cherrity kids: you see if she doesn't.\n\nLADY CICELY (busily). Goodbye, Howard: don't be anxious about me; and\nabove all, don't bring a parcel of men with guns to rescue me. I\nshall be all right now that I am getting away from the escort. Captain\nBrassbound: I rely on you to see that Sir Howard gets safe to Mogador.\n(Whispering) Take your hand off that pistol. (He takes his hand out of\nhis pocket, reluctantly.) Goodbye.\n\nA tumult without. They all turn apprehensively to the arch. Osman rushes\nin.\n\nOSMAN. The Cadi, the Cadi. He is in anger. His men are upon us. Defend--\n\nThe Cadi, a vigorous, fatfeatured, choleric, whitehaired and bearded\nelder, rushes in, cudgel in hand, with an overwhelming retinue, and\nsilences Osman with a sounding thwack. In a moment the back of the room\nis crowded with his followers. The Sheikh retreats a little towards his\nmen; and the Cadi comes impetuously forward between him and Lady Cicely.\n\nTHE CADI. Now woe upon thee, Sidi el Assif, thou child of mischief!\n\nSIDI (sternly). Am I a dog, Muley Othman, that thou speakest thus to me?\n\nTHE CADI. Wilt thou destroy thy country, and give us all into the hands\nof them that set the sea on fire but yesterday with their ships of war?\nWhere are the Franguestani captives?\n\nLADY CICELY. Here we are, Cadi. How dye do?\n\nTHE CADI. Allah upon thee, thou moon at the full! Where is thy kinsman,\nthe Cadi of Franguestan? I am his friend, his servant. I come on behalf\nof my master the Sultan to do him honor, and to cast down his enemies.\n\nSIR HOWARD. You are very good, I am sure.\n\nSIDI (graver than ever). Muley Othman--\n\nTAE CADI (fumbling in his breast). Peace, peace, thou inconsiderate one.\n(He takes out a letter.)\n\nBRASSBOUND. Cadi--\n\nTHE CADI. Oh thou dog, thou, thou accursed Brassbound, son of a wanton:\nit is thou hast led Sidi el Assif into this wrongdoing. Read this\nwriting that thou hast brought upon me from the commander of the\nwarship.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Warship! (He takes the letter and opens it, his men\nwhispering to one another very low-spiritedly meanwhile.)\n\nREDBROOK. Warship! Whew!\n\nJOHNSON. Gunboat, praps.\n\nDRINKWATER. Lawk bloomin Worterleoo buses, they are, on this cowst.\n\nBrassbound folds up the letter, looking glum.\n\nSIR HOWARD (sharply). Well, sir, are we not to have the benefit of that\nletter? Your men are waiting to hear it, I think.\n\nBRASSBOUND. It is not a British ship. (Sir Howard's face falls.)\n\nLADY CICELY. What is it, then?\n\nBRASSBOUND. An American cruiser. The Santiago.\n\nTHE CADI (tearing his beard). Woe! alas! it is where they set the sea on\nfire.\n\nSIDI. Peace, Muley Othman: Allah is still above us.\n\nJOHNSON. Would you mind readin it to us, capn?\n\nBRASSBOUND (grimly). Oh, I'll read it to you. \"Mogador Harbor. 26 Sept.\n1899. Captain Hamlin Kearney, of the cruiser Santiago, presents the\ncompliments of the United States to the Cadi Muley Othman el Kintafi,\nand announces that he is coming to look for the two British travellers\nSir Howard Hallam and Lady Cicely Waynflete, in the Cadi's jurisdiction.\nAs the search will be conducted with machine guns, the prompt return of\nthe travellers to Mogador Harbor will save much trouble to all parties.\"\n\nTHE CADI. As I live, O Cadi, and thou, moon of loveliness, ye shall be\nled back to Mogador with honor. And thou, accursed Brassbound, shall go\nthither a prisoner in chains, thou and thy people. (Brassbound and his\nmen make a movement to defend themselves.) Seize them.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, please don't fight. (Brassbound, seeing that his men\nare hopelessly outnumbered, makes no resistance. They are made prisoners\nby the Cadi's followers.)\n\nSIDI (attempting to draw his scimitar). The woman is mine: I will not\nforego her. (He is seized and overpowered after a Homeric struggle.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (drily). I told you you were not in a strong position,\nCaptain Brassbound. (Looking implacably at him.) You are laid by the\nheels, my friend, as I said you would be.\n\nLADY CICELY. But I assure you--\n\nBRASSBOUND (interrupting her). What have you to assure him of? You\npersuaded me to spare him. Look at his face. Will you be able to\npersuade him to spare me?\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nTorrid forenoon filtered through small Moorish windows high up in the\nadobe walls of the largest room in Leslie Rankin's house. A clean\ncool room, with the table (a Christian article) set in the middle, a\npresidentially elbowed chair behind it, and an inkstand and paper ready\nfor the sitter. A couple of cheap American chairs right and left of the\ntable, facing the same way as the presidential chair, give a judicial\naspect to the arrangement. Rankin is placing a little tray with a jug\nand some glasses near the inkstand when Lady Cicely's voice is heard at\nthe door, which is behind him in the corner to his right.\n\nLADE CICELY. Good morning. May I come in?\n\nRANKIN. Certainly. (She comes in, to the nearest end of the table. She\nhas discarded all travelling equipment, and is dressed exactly as she\nmight be in Surrey on a very hot day.) Sit ye doon, Leddy Ceecily.\n\nLADY CICELY (sitting down). How nice you've made the room for the\ninquiry!\n\nRANKIN (doubtfully). I could wish there were more chairs. Yon American\ncaptain will preside in this; and that leaves but one for Sir Howrrd and\none for your leddyship. I could almost be tempted to call it a maircy\nthat your friend that owns the yacht has sprained his ankle and cannot\ncome. I misdoubt me it will not look judeecial to have Captain Kearney's\nofficers squatting on the floor.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, they won't mind. What about the prisoners?\n\nRANKIN. They are to be broat here from the town gaol presently.\n\nLADY CICELY. And where is that silly old Cadi, and my handsome Sheikh\nSidi? I must see them before the inquiry,or they'll give Captain Kearney\nquite a false impression of what happened.\n\nRANKIN. But ye cannot see them. They decamped last night, back to their\ncastles in the Atlas.\n\nLADY CICELY (delighted). No!\n\nRANKIN. Indeed and they did. The poor Cadi is so terrified by all he\nhas haird of the destruction of the Spanish fleet, that he daren't trust\nhimself in the captain's hands. (Looking reproachfully at her) On your\njourney back here, ye seem to have frightened the poor man yourself,\nLeddy Ceecily, by talking to him about the fanatical Chreestianity of\nthe Americans. Ye have largely yourself to thank if he's gone.\n\nLADY CICELY. Allah be praised! WHAT a weight off our minds, Mr. Rankin!\n\nRANKIN (puzzled). And why? Do ye not understand how necessary their\nevidence is?\n\nLADY CICELY. THEIR evidence! It would spoil everything. They would\nperjure themselves out of pure spite against poor Captain Brassbound.\n\nRANKIN (amazed). Do ye call him POOR Captain Brassbound! Does not your\nleddyship know that this Brasshound is--Heaven forgive me for judging\nhim!--a precious scoundrel? Did ye not hear what Sir Howrrd told me on\nthe yacht last night?\n\nLADY CICELY. All a mistake, Mr. Rankin: all a mistake, I assure you.\nYou said just now, Heaven forgive you for judging him! Well, that's just\nwhat the whole quarrel is about. Captain Brassbound is just like you:\nhe thinks we have no right to judge one another; and its Sir Howard gets\n\u00c2\u00a35,000 a year for doing nothing else but judging people, he thinks poor\nCaptain Brassbound a regular Anarchist. They quarreled dreadfully at\nthe castle. You mustn't mind what Sir Howard says about him: you really\nmustn't.\n\nRANKIN. But his conduct--\n\nLADY CICELY. Perfectly saintly, Mr. Rankin. Worthy of yourself in your\nbest moments. He forgave Sir Howard, and did all he could to save him.\n\nRANKIN. Ye astoanish me, Leddy Ceecily.\n\nLADY CICELY. And think of the temptation to behave badly when he had us\nall there helpless!\n\nRANKIN. The temptation! ay: that's true. Ye're ower bonny to be cast\naway among a parcel o lone, lawless men, my leddy.\n\nLADY CICELY (naively). Bless me, that's quite true; and I never thought\nof it! Oh, after that you really must do all you can to help Captain\nBrassbound.\n\nRANKIN (reservedly). No: I cannot say that, Leddy Ceecily. I doubt he\nhas imposed on your good nature and sweet disposeetion. I had a crack\nwith the Cadi as well as with Sir Howrrd; and there is little question in\nmy mind but that Captain Brassbound is no better than a breegand.\n\nLADY CICELY (apparently deeply impressed). I wonder whether he can be,\nMr. Rankin. If you think so, that's heavily against him in my opinion,\nbecause you have more knowledge of men than anyone else here. Perhaps\nI'm mistaken. I only thought you might like to help him as the son of\nyour old friend.\n\nRANKIN (startled). The son of my old friend! What d'ye mean?\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh! Didn't Sir Howard tell you that? Why, Captain\nBrassbound turns out to be Sir Howard's nephew, the son of the brother\nyou knew.\n\nRANKIN (overwhelmed). I saw the likeness the night he came here! It's\ntrue: it's true. Uncle and nephew!\n\nLADY CICELY. Yes: that's why they quarrelled so.\n\nRANKIN (with a momentary sense of ill usage). I think Sir Howrrd might\nhave told me that.\n\nLADY CICELY. Of course he OUGHT to have told you. You see he only tells\none side of the story. That comes from his training as a barrister. You\nmustn't think he's naturally deceitful: if he'd been brought up as a\nclergyman, he'd have told you the whole truth as a matter of course.\n\nRANKIN (too much perturbed to dwell on his grievance). Leddy Ceecily: I\nmust go to the prison and see the lad. He may have been a bit wild; but\nI can't leave poor Miles's son unbefriended in a foreign gaol.\n\nLADY CICELY (rising, radiant). Oh, how good of you! You have a real kind\nheart of gold, Mr. Rankin. Now, before you go, shall we just put our\nheads together, and consider how to give Miles's son every chance--I\nmean of course every chance that he ought to have.\n\nRANKIN (rather addled). I am so confused by this astoanishing news--\n\nLADY CICELY. Yes, yes: of course you are. But don't you think he would\nmake a better impression on the American captain if he were a little\nmore respectably dressed?\n\nRANKIN. Mebbe. But how can that be remedied here in Mogador?\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, I've thought of that. You know I'm going back to\nEngland by way of Rome, Mr. Rankin; and I'm bringing a portmanteau full\nof clothes for my brother there: he's ambassador, you know, and has to\nbe VERY particular as to what he wears. I had the portmanteau brought\nhere this morning. Now WOULD you mind taking it to the prison, and\nsmartening up Captain Brassbound a little. Tell him he ought to do it to\nshow his respect for me; and he will. It will be quite easy: there are\ntwo Krooboys waiting to carry the portmanteau. You will: I know you\nwill. (She edges him to the door.) And do you think there is time to get\nhim shaved?\n\nRANKIN (succumbing, half bewildered). I'll do my best.\n\nLADY CICELY. I know you will. (As he is going out) Oh! one word, Mr.\nRankin. (He comes back.) The Cadi didn't know that Captain Brassbound\nwas Sir Howard's nephew, did he?\n\nRANKIN. No.\n\nLADY CICELY. Then he must have misunderstood everything quite\ndreadfully. I'm afraid, Mr. Rankin--though you know best, of\ncourse--that we are bound not to repeat anything at the inquiry that the\nCadi said. He didn't know, you see.\n\nRANKIN (cannily). I take your point, Leddy Ceecily. It alters the case.\nI shall certainly make no allusion to it.\n\nLADY CICELY (magnanimously). Well, then, I won't either. There! They\nshake hands on it. Sir Howard comes in.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Good morning Mr. Rankin. I hope you got home safely from the\nyacht last night.\n\nRANKIN. Quite safe, thank ye, Sir Howrrd.\n\nLADY CICELY. Howard, he's in a hurry. Don't make him stop to talk.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Very good, very good. (He comes to the table and takes Lady\nCicely's chair.)\n\nRANKIN. Oo revoir, Leddy Ceecily.\n\nLADY CICELY. Bless you, Mr. Rankin. (Rankin goes out. She comes to\nthe other end of the table, looking at Sir Howard with a troubled,\nsorrowfully sympathetic air, but unconsciously making her right hand\nstalk about the table on the tips of its fingers in a tentative stealthy\nway which would put Sir Howard on his guard if he were in a suspicious\nframe of mind, which, as it happens, he is not.) I'm so sorry for you,\nHoward, about this unfortunate inquiry.\n\nSIR HOWARD (swinging round on his chair, astonished). Sorry for ME! Why?\n\nLADY CICELY. It will look so dreadful. Your own nephew, you know.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Cicely: an English judge has no nephews, no sons even, when\nhe has to carry out the law.\n\nLADY CICELY. But then he oughtn't to have any property either. People\nwill never understand about the West Indian Estate. They'll think you're\nthe wicked uncle out of the Babes in the Wood. (With a fresh gush of\ncompassion) I'm so SO sorry for you.\n\nSIR HOWARD (rather stiffly). I really do not see how I need your\ncommiseration, Cicely. The woman was an impossible person, half mad,\nhalf drunk. Do you understand what such a creature is when she has a\ngrievance, and imagines some innocent person to be the author of it?\n\nLADY CICELY (with a touch of impatience). Oh, quite. THAT'll be made\nclear enough. I can see it all in the papers already: our half mad,\nhalf drunk sister-in-law, making scenes with you in the street, with the\npolice called in, and prison and all the rest of it. The family will\nbe furious. (Sir Howard quails. She instantly follows up her advantage\nwith) Think of papa!\n\nSIR HOWARD. I shall expect Lord Waynflete to look at the matter as a\nreasonable man.\n\nLADY CICELY. Do you think he's so greatly changed as that, Howard?\n\nSIR HOWARD (falling back on the fatalism of the depersonalized public\nman). My dear Cicely: there is no use discussing the matter. It cannot\nbe helped, however disagreeable it may be.\n\nLADY CICELY. Of course not. That's what's so dreadful. Do you think\npeople will understand?\n\nSIR HOWARD. I really cannot say. Whether they do or not, I cannot help\nit.\n\nLADY CICELY. If you were anybody but a judge, it wouldn't matter so\nmuch. But a judge mustn't even be misunderstood. (Despairingly) Oh, it's\ndreadful, Howard: it's terrible! What would poor Mary say if she were\nalive now?\n\nSIR HOWARD (with emotion). I don't think, Cicely, that my dear wife\nwould misunderstand me.\n\nLADY CICELY. No: SHE'D know you mean well. And when you came home and\nsaid, \"Mary: I've just told all the world that your sister-in-law was a\npolice court criminal, and that I sent her to prison; and your nephew is\na brigand, and I'm sending HIM to prison.\" she'd have thought it must be\nall right because you did it. But you don't think she would have LIKED\nit, any more than papa and the rest of us, do you?\n\nSIR HOWARD (appalled). But what am I to do? Do you ask me to compound a\nfelony?\n\nLADY CICELY (sternly). Certainly not. I would not allow such a thing,\neven if you were wicked enough to attempt it. No. What I say is, that\nyou ought not to tell the story yourself\n\nSIR HOWARD. Why?\n\nLADY CICELY. Because everybody would say you are such a clever lawyer\nyou could make a poor simple sailor like Captain Kearney believe\nanything. The proper thing for you to do, Howard, is to let ME tell the\nexact truth. Then you can simply say that you are bound to confirm me.\nNobody can blame you for that.\n\nSIR HOWARD (looking suspiciously at her). Cicely: you are up to some\ndevilment.\n\nLADY CICELY (promptly washing her hands of his interests). Oh, very\nwell. Tell the story yourself, in your own clever way. I only proposed\nto tell the exact truth. You call that devilment. So it is, I daresay,\nfrom a lawyer's point of view.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I hope you're not offended.\n\nLADY CICELY (with the utmost goodhumor). My dear Howard, not a bit. Of\ncourse you're right: you know how these things ought to be done. I'll do\nexactly what you tell me, and confirm everything you say.\n\nSIR HOWARD (alarmed by the completeness of his victory). Oh, my dear,\nyou mustn't act in MY interest. You must give your evidence with\nabsolute impartiality. (She nods, as if thoroughly impressed and\nreproved, and gazes at him with the steadfast candor peculiar to liars\nwho read novels. His eyes turn to the ground; and his brow clouds\nperplexedly. He rises; rubs his chin nervously with his forefinger; and\nadds) I think, perhaps, on reflection, that there is something to be\nsaid for your proposal to relieve me of the very painful duty of telling\nwhat has occurred.\n\nLADI CICELY (holding off). But you'd do it so very much better.\n\nSIR HOWARD. For that very reason, perhaps, it had better come from you.\n\nLADY CICELY (reluctantly). Well, if you'd rather.\n\nSIR HOWARD. But mind, Cicely, the exact truth.\n\nLADY CICELY (with conviction). The exact truth. (They shake hands on\nit.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (holding her hand). Fiat justitia: ruat coelum!\n\nLADY CICELY. Let Justice be done, though the ceiling fall.\n\nAn American bluejacket appears at the door.\n\nBLUEJACKET. Captain Kearney's cawmpliments to Lady Waynflete; and may he\ncome in?\n\nLADY CICELY. Yes. By all means. Where are the prisoners?\n\nBLUEJACKET. Party gawn to the jail to fetch em, marm.\n\nLADY CICELY. Thank you. I should like to be told when they are coming,\nif I might.\n\nBLUEJACKET. You shall so, marm. (He stands aside, saluting, to admit his\ncaptain, and goes out.)\n\nCaptain Hamlin Kearney is a robustly built western American, with the\nkeen, squeezed, wind beaten eyes and obstinately enduring mouth of his\nprofession. A curious ethnological specimen, with all the nations of\nthe old world at war in his veins, he is developing artificially in\nthe direction of sleekness and culture under the restraints of an\noverwhelming dread of European criticism, and climatically in the\ndirection of the indiginous North American, who is already in possession\nof his hair, his cheekbones, and the manlier instincts in him, which\nthe sea has rescued from civilization. The world, pondering on the great\npart of its own future which is in his hands, contemplates him with\nwonder as to what the devil he will evolve into in another century or\ntwo. Meanwhile he presents himself to Lady Cicely as a blunt sailor who\nhas something to say to her concerning her conduct which he wishes to\nput politely, as becomes an officer addressing a lady, but also with an\nemphatically implied rebuke, as an American addressing an English person\nwho has taken a liberty.\n\nLADY CICELY (as he enters). So glad you've come, Captain Kearney.\n\nKEARNEY (coming between Sir Howard and Lady Cicely). When we parted\nyesterday ahfternoon, Lady Waynflete, I was unaware that in the\ncourse of your visit to my ship you had entirely altered the sleeping\narrangements of my stokers. I thahnk you. As captain of the ship, I\nam customairily cawnsulted before the orders of English visitors are\ncarried out; but as your alterations appear to cawndooce to the comfort\nof the men, I have not interfered with them.\n\nLADY CICELY. How clever of you to find out! I believe you know every\nbolt in that ship.\n\nKearney softens perceptibly.\n\nSIR HOWARD. I am really very sorry that my sister-in-law has taken so\nserious a liberty, Captain Kearney. It is a mania of hers--simply a\nmania. Why did your men pay any attention to her?\n\nKEARNEY (with gravely dissembled humor). Well, I ahsked that question\ntoo. I said, Why did you obey that lady's orders instead of waiting for\nmine? They said they didn't see exactly how they could refuse. I ahsked\nwhether they cawnsidered that discipline. They said, Well, sir, will you\ntalk to the lady yourself next time?\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm so sorry. But you know, Captain, the one thing that one\nmisses on board a man-of-war is a woman.\n\nKEARNEY. We often feel that deprivation verry keenly, Lady Waynflete.\n\nLADY CICELY. My uncle is first Lord of the Admiralty; and I am always\ntelling him what a scandal it is that an English captain should be\nforbidden to take his wife on board to look after the ship.\n\nKEARNEY. Stranger still, Lady Waynflete, he is not forbidden to take any\nother lady. Yours is an extraordinairy country--to an Amerrican.\n\nLADY CICELY. But it's most serious, Captain. The poor men go melancholy\nmad, and ram each other's ships and do all sorts of things.\n\nSIR HOWARD. Cicely: I beg you will not talk nonsense to Captain Kearney.\nYour ideas on some subjects are really hardly decorous.\n\nLADY CICELY (to Kearney). That's what English people are like, Captain\nKearney. They won't hear of anything concerning you poor sailors except\nNelson and Trafalgar. YOU understand me, don't you?\n\nKEARNEY (gallantly). I cawnsider that you have more sense in your\nwedding ring finger than the British Ahdmiralty has in its whole\ncawnstitootion, Lady Waynflete.\n\nLADY CICELY. Of course I have. Sailors always understand things.\n\nThe bluejacket reappears.\n\nBLUEJACKET (to Lady Cicely). Prisoners coming up the hill, marm.\n\nKEARNEY (turning sharply on him). Who sent you in to say that?\n\nBLUEJACKET (calmly). British lady's orders, sir. (He goes out,\nunruffled, leaving Kearney dumbfounded.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (contemplating Kearney's expression with dismay). I am really\nvery sorry, Captain Kearney. I am quite aware that Lady Cicely has no\nright whatever to give orders to your men.\n\nLADY CICELY. I didn't give orders: I just asked him. He has such a nice\nface! Don't you think so, Captain Kearney? (He gasps, speechless.) And\nnow will you excuse me a moment. I want to speak to somebody before the\ninquiry begins. (She hurries out.)\n\nKEARNEY. There is sertnly a wonderful chahrn about the British\naristocracy, Sir Howard Hallam. Are they all like that? (He takes the\npresidential chair.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (resuming his seat on Kearney's right). Fortunately not,\nCaptain Kearney. Half a dozen such women would make an end of law in\nEngland in six months.\n\nThe bluejacket comes to the door again.\n\nBLUEJACKET. All ready, sir.\n\nKEARNEY. Verry good. I'm waiting.\n\nThe bluejacket turns and intimates this to those without.\n\nThe officers of the Santiago enter.\n\nSIR HOWARD (rising and bobbing to them in a judicial manner). Good\nmorning, gentlemen.\n\nThey acknowledge the greeting rather shyly, bowing or touching their\ncaps, and stand in a group behind Kearney.\n\nKEARNEY (to Sir Howard). You will be glahd to hear that I have a verry\ngood account of one of our prisoners from our chahplain, who visited\nthem in the gaol. He has expressed a wish to be cawnverted to\nEpiscopalianism.\n\nSIR HOWARD (drily). Yes, I think I know him.\n\nKEARNEY. Bring in the prisoners.\n\nBLUEJACKET (at the door). They are engaged with the British lady, sir.\nShall I ask her--\n\nKEARNEY (jumping up and exploding in storm piercing tones). Bring in the\nprisoners. Tell the lady those are my orders. Do you hear? Tell her so.\n(The bluejacket goes out dubiously. The officers look at one another in\nmute comment on the unaccountable pepperiness of their commander.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (suavely). Mr. Rankin will be present, I presume.\n\nKEARNEY (angrily). Rahnkin! Who is Rahnkin?\n\nSIR HOWARD. Our host the missionary.\n\nKEARNEY (subsiding unwillingly). Oh! Rahnkin, is he? He'd better look\nsharp or he'll be late. (Again exploding.) What are they doing with\nthose prisoners?\n\nRankin hurries in, and takes his place near Sir Howard.\n\nSIR HOWARD. This is Mr. Rankin, Captain Kearney.\n\nRANKIN. Excuse my delay, Captain Kearney. The leddy sent me on an\nerrand. (Kearney grunts.) I thought I should be late. But the first\nthing I heard when I arrived was your officer giving your compliments to\nLeddy Ceecily, and would she kindly allow the prisoners to come in, as\nyou were anxious to see her again. Then I knew I was in time.\n\nKEARNEY. Oh, that was it, was it? May I ask, sir, did you notice any\nsign on Lady Waynflete's part of cawmplying with that verry moderate\nrequest?\n\nLADY CICELY (outside). Coming, coming.\n\nThe prisoners are brought in by a guard of armed bluejackets.\n\nDrinkwater first, again elaborately clean, and conveying by a virtuous\nand steadfast smirk a cheerful confidence in his innocence. Johnson\nsolid and inexpressive, Redbrook unconcerned and debonair, Marzo uneasy.\nThese four form a little group together on the captain's left. The rest\nwait unintelligently on Providence in a row against the wall on the\nsame side, shepherded by the bluejackets. The first bluejacket, a petty\nofficer, posts himself on the captain's right, behind Rankin and Sir\nHoward. Finally Brassbound appears with Lady Cicely on his arm. He is\nin fashionable frock coat and trousers, spotless collar and cuffs,\nand elegant boots. He carries a glossy tall hat in his hand. To an\nunsophisticated eye, the change is monstrous and appalling; and its\neffect on himself is so unmanning that he is quite out of countenance--a\nshaven Samson. Lady Cicely, however, is greatly pleased with it; and the\nrest regard it as an unquestionable improvement. The officers fall back\ngallantly to allow her to pass. Kearney rises to receive her, and stares\nwith some surprise at Brassbound as he stops at the table on his left.\nSir Howard rises punctiliously when Kearney rises and sits when he sits.\n\nKEARNEY. Is this another gentleman of your party, Lady Waynflete? I\npresume I met you lahst night, sir, on board the yacht.\n\nBRASSBOUND. No. I am your prisoner. My name is Brassbound.\n\nDRINKWATER (officiously). Kepn Brarsbahnd, of the schooner Thenksgiv--\n\nREDBROOK (hastily). Shut up, you fool. (He elbows Drinkwater into the\nbackground.)\n\nKEARNEY (surprised and rather suspicious). Well, I hardly understahnd\nthis. However, if you are Captain Brassbound, you can take your place\nwith the rest. (Brassbound joins Redbrook and Johnson. Kearney sits down\nagain, after inviting Lady Cicely, with a solemn gesture, to take the\nvacant chair.) Now let me see. You are a man of experience in these\nmatters, Sir Howard Hallam. If you had to conduct this business, how\nwould you start?\n\nLADY CICELY. He'd call on the counsel for the prosecution, wouldn't you,\nHoward?\n\nSIR HOWARD. But there is no counsel for the prosecution, Cicely.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh yes there is. I'm counsel for the prosecution. You\nmustn't let Sir Howard make a speech, Captain Kearney: his doctors have\npositively forbidden anything of that sort. Will you begin with me?\n\nKEARNEY. By your leave, Lady Waynfiete, I think I will just begin with\nmyself. Sailor fashion will do as well here as lawyer fashion.\n\nLADY CICELY. Ever so much better, dear Captain Kearney. (Silence.\nKearney composes himself to speak. She breaks out again). You look so\nnice as a judge!\n\nA general smile. Drinkwater splutters into a half suppressed laugh.\n\nREDBROOK (in a fierce whisper). Shut up, you fool, will you? (Again he\npushes him back with a furtive kick.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (remonstrating). Cicely!\n\nKEARNEY (grimly keeping his countenance). Your ladyship's cawmpliments\nwill be in order at a later stage. Captain Brassbound: the position\nis this. My ship, the United States cruiser Santiago, was spoken off\nMogador latest Thursday by the yacht Redgauntlet. The owner of the\naforesaid yacht, who is not present through having sprained his ankle,\ngave me sertn information. In cawnsequence of that information the\nSantiago made the twenty knots to Mogador Harbor inside of fifty-seven\nminutes. Before noon next day a messenger of mine gave the Cadi of the\ndistrict sertn information. In cawnsequence of that information the Cadi\nstimulated himself to some ten knots an hour, and lodged you and your\nmen in Mogador jail at my disposal. The Cadi then went back to his\nmountain fahstnesses; so we shall not have the pleasure of his company\nhere to-day. Do you follow me so far?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Yes. I know what you did and what the Cadi did. The point\nis, why did you do it?\n\nKEARNEY. With doo patience we shall come to that presently. Mr. Rahnkin:\nwill you kindly take up the parable?\n\nRANKIN. On the very day that Sir Howrrd and Lady Cicely started on their\nexcursion I was applied to for medicine by a follower of the Sheikh Sidi\nel Assif. He told me I should never see Sir Howrrd again, because his\nmaster knew he was a Christian and would take him out of the hands of\nCaptain Brassbound. I hurried on board the yacht and told the owner to\nscour the coast for a gunboat or cruiser to come into the harbor and\nput persuasion on the authorities. (Sir Howard turns and looks at Rankin\nwith a sudden doubt of his integrity as a witness.)\n\nKEARNEY. But I understood from our chahplain that you reported Captain\nBrassbound as in league with the Sheikh to deliver Sir Howard up to him.\n\nRANKIN. That was my first hasty conclusion, Captain Kearney. But it\nappears that the compact between them was that Captain Brassbound should\nescort travellers under the Sheikh's protection at a certain payment\nper head, provided none of them were Christians. As I understand it, he\ntried to smuggle Sir Howrrd through under this compact, and the Sheikh\nfound him out.\n\nDRINKWATER. Rawt, gavner. Thet's jest ah it wors. The Kepn--\n\nREDBROOK (again suppressing him). Shut up, you fool, I tell you.\n\nSIR HOWARD (to Rankin). May I ask have you had any conversation with\nLady Cicely on this subject?\n\nRANKIN (naively). Yes. (Sir Howard qrunts emphatically, as who should\nsay \"I thought so.\" Rankin continues, addressing the court) May I say\nhow sorry I am that there are so few chairs, Captain and gentlemen.\n\nKEARNEY (with genial American courtesy). Oh, THAT's all right, Mr.\nRahnkin. Well, I see no harm so far: it's human fawlly, but not human\ncrime. Now the counsel for the prosecution can proceed to prosecute. The\nfloor is yours, Lady Waynflete.\n\nLADY CICELY (rising). I can only tell you the exact truth--\n\nDRINKWATER (involuntarily). Naow, down't do thet, lidy--\n\nREDBROOK (as before). SHUT up, you fool, will you?\n\nLADY CICELY. We had a most delightful trip in the hills; and Captain\nBrassbound's men could not have been nicer--I must say that for\nthem--until we saw a tribe of Arabs--such nice looking men!--and then\nthe poor things were frightened.\n\nKEARNEY. The Arabs?\n\nLADY CICELY. No: Arabs are never frightened. The escort, of course:\nescorts are always frightened. I wanted to speak to the Arab chief; but\nCaptain Brassbound cruelly shot his horse; and the chief shot the Count;\nand then--\n\nKEARNEY. The Count! What Count?\n\nLADY CICELY. Marzo. That's Marzo (pointing to Marzo, who grins and\ntouches his forehead).\n\nKEARNEY (slightly overwhelmed by the unexpected profusion of incident\nand character in her story). Well, what happened then?\n\nLADY CICELY. Then the escort ran away--all escorts do--and dragged me\ninto the castle, which you really ought to make them clean and whitewash\nthoroughly, Captain Kearney. Then Captain Brassbound and Sir Howard\nturned out to be related to one another (sensation); and then of course,\nthere was a quarrel. The Hallams always quarrel.\n\nSIR HOWARD (rising to protest). Cicely! Captain Kearney: this man told\nme--\n\nLADY CICELY (swiftly interrupting him). You mustn't say what people told\nyou: it's not evidence. (Sir Howard chokes with indignation.)\n\nKEARNEY (calmly). Allow the lady to proceed, Sir Howard Hallam.\n\nSIR HOWARD (recovering his self-control with a gulp, and resuming his\nseat). I beg your pardon, Captain Kearney.\n\nLADY CICELY. Then Sidi came.\n\nKEARNEY. Sidney! Who was Sidney?\n\nLADY CICELY. No, Sidi. The Sheikh. Sidi el Assif. A noble creature, with\nsuch a fine face! He fell in love with me at first sight--\n\nSIR HOWARD (remonstrating). Cicely!\n\nLADY CICELY. He did: you know he did. You told me to tell the exact\ntruth.\n\nKEARNEY. I can readily believe it, madam. Proceed.\n\nLADY CICELY. Well, that put the poor fellow into a most cruel dilemma.\nYou see, he could claim to carry off Sir Howard, because Sir Howard is a\nChristian. But as I am only a woman, he had no claim to me.\n\nKEARNEY (somewhat sternly, suspecting Lady Cicely of aristocratic\natheism). But you are a Christian woman.\n\nLADY CICELY. No: the Arabs don't count women. They don't believe we have\nany souls.\n\nRANKIN. That is true, Captain: the poor benighted creatures!\n\nLADY CICELY. Well, what was he to do? He wasn't in love with Sir Howard;\nand he WAS in love with me. So he naturally offered to swop Sir Howard\nfor me. Don't you think that was nice of him, Captain Kearney?\n\nKEARNEY. I should have done the same myself, Lady Waynflete. Proceed.\n\nLADY CICELY. Captain Brassbound, I must say, was nobleness itself, in\nspite of the quarrel between himself and Sir Howard. He refused to give\nup either of us, and was on the point of fighting for us when in came\nthe Cadi with your most amusing and delightful letter, captain, and\nbundled us all back to Mogador after calling my poor Sidi the most\ndreadful names, and putting all the blame on Captain Brassbound. So here\nwe are. Now, Howard, isn't that the exact truth, every word of it?\n\nSIR HOWARD. It is the truth, Cicely, and nothing but the truth. But the\nEnglish law requires a witness to tell the WHOLE truth.\n\nLADY CICELY. What nonsense! As if anybody ever knew the whole truth\nabout anything! (Sitting down, much hurt and discouraged.) I'm sorry you\nwish Captain Kearney to understand that I am an untruthful witness.\n\nSIR HOWARD. No: but--\n\nLADY CICELY. Very well, then: please don't say things that convey that\nimpression.\n\nKEARNEY. But Sir Howard told me yesterday that Captain Brassbound\nthreatened to sell him into slavery.\n\nLADY CICELY (springing up again). Did Sir Howard tell you the things he\nsaid about Captain Brassbound's mother? (Renewed sensation.) I told you\nthey quarrelled, Captain Kearney. I said so, didn't I?\n\nREDBROOK (crisply). Distinctly. (Drinkwater opens his mouth to\ncorroborate.) Shut up, you fool.\n\nLADY CICELY. Of course I did. Now, Captain Kearney, do YOU want me--does\nSir Howard want me--does ANYBODY want me to go into the details of\nthat shocking family quarrel? Am I to stand here in the absence of any\nindividual of my own sex and repeat the language of two angry men?\n\nKEARNEY (rising impressively). The United States navy will have no\nhahnd in offering any violence to the pure instincts of womanhood. Lady\nWaynflete: I thahnk you for the delicacy with which you have given\nyour evidence. (Lady Cicely beams on him gratefully and sits down\ntriumphant.) Captain Brassbound: I shall not hold you respawnsible\nfor what you may have said when the English bench addressed you in the\nlanguage of the English forecastle-- (Sir Howard is about to protest.)\nNo, Sir Howard Hallam: excuse ME. In moments of pahssion I have called\na man that myself. We are glahd to find real flesh and blood beneath the\nermine of the judge. We will all now drop a subject that should never\nhave been broached in a lady's presence. (He resumes his seat, and adds,\nin a businesslike tone) Is there anything further before we release\nthese men?\n\nBLUEJACKET. There are some dawcuments handed over by the Cadi, sir. He\nreckoned they were sort of magic spells. The chahplain ordered them to\nbe reported to you and burnt, with your leave, sir.\n\nKEARNEY. What are they?\n\nBLUEJACKET (reading from a list). Four books, torn and dirty, made up of\nseparate numbers, value each wawn penny, and entitled Sweeny Todd, the\nDemon Barber of London; The Skeleton Horseman--\n\nDRINKWATER (rushing forward in painful alarm, and anxiety). It's maw\nlawbrary, gavner. Down't burn em.\n\nKEARNEY. You'll be better without that sort of reading, my man.\n\nDRINKWATER (in intense distress, appealing to Lady Cicely) Down't let\nem burn em, Lidy. They dasn't if you horder them not to. (With desperate\neloquence) Yer dunno wot them books is to me. They took me aht of the\nsawdid reeyellities of the Worterleoo Rowd. They formed maw mawnd: they\nshaowed me sathink awgher than the squalor of a corster's lawf--\n\nREDBROOK (collaring him). Oh shut up, you fool. Get out. Hold your ton--\n\nDRINKWATER (frantically breaking from him). Lidy, lidy: sy a word for\nme. Ev a feelin awt. (His tears choke him: he clasps his hands in dumb\nentreaty.)\n\nLADY CICELY (touched). Don't burn his books. Captain. Let me give them\nback to him.\n\nKEARNEY. The books will be handed over to the lady.\n\nDRINKWATER (in a small voice). Thenkyer, Lidy. (He retires among his\ncomrades, snivelling subduedly.)\n\nREDBROOK (aside to him as he passes). You silly ass, you. (Drinkwater\nsniffs and does not reply.)\n\nKEARNEY. I suppose you and your men accept this lady's account of what\npassed, Captain Brassbound.\n\nBRASSBOUND (gloomily). Yes. It is true--as far as it goes.\n\nKEARNEY (impatiently). Do you wawnt it to go any further?\n\nMARZO. She leave out something. Arab shoot me. She nurse me. She cure\nme.\n\nKEARNEY. And who are you, pray?\n\nMARZO (seized with a sanctimonious desire to demonstrate his higher\nnature). Only dam thief. Dam liar. Dam rascal. She no lady.\n\nJOHNSON (revolted by the seeming insult to the English peerage from a\nlow Italian). What? What's that you say?\n\nMARZO. No lady nurse dam rascal. Only saint. She saint. She get me to\nheaven--get us all to heaven. We do what we like now.\n\nLADY CICELY. Indeed you will do nothing of the sort Marzo, unless you\nlike to behave yourself very nicely indeed. What hour did you say we\nwere to lunch at, Captain Kearney?\n\nKEARNEY. You recall me to my dooty, Lady Waynflete. My barge will be\nready to take off you and Sir Howard to the Santiago at one o'clawk. (He\nrises.) Captain Brassbound: this innquery has elicited no reason why I\nshould detain you or your men. I advise you to ahct as escort in future\nto heathens exclusively. Mr. Rahnkin: I thahnk you in the name of the\nUnited States for the hospitahlity you have extended to us today; and\nI invite you to accompany me bahck to my ship with a view to lunch at\nhalf-past one. Gentlemen: we will wait on the governor of the gaol on\nour way to the harbor (He goes out, following his officers, and followed\nby the bluejackets and the petty officer.)\n\nSIR HOWARD (to Lady Cicely). Cicely: in the course of my professional\ncareer I have met with unscrupulous witnesses, and, I am sorry to say,\nunscrupulous counsel also. But the combination of unscrupulous witness\nand unscrupulous counsel I have met to-day has taken away my breath You\nhave made me your accomplice in defeating justice.\n\nLADY CICELY. Yes: aren't you glad it's been defeated for once? (She\ntakes his arm to go out with him.) Captain Brassbound: I will come back\nto say goodbye before I go. (He nods gloomily. She goes out with Sir\nHoward, following the Captain and his staff.)\n\nRANKIN (running to Brassbound and taking both his hands). I'm right glad\nye're cleared. I'll come back and have a crack with ye when yon lunch is\nover. God bless ye. (Hs goes out quickly.)\n\nBrassbound and his men, left by themselves in the room, free and\nunobserved, go straight out of their senses. They laugh; they dance;\nthey embrace one another; they set to partners and waltz clumsily; they\nshake hands repeatedly and maudlinly. Three only retain some sort of\nself-possession. Marzo, proud of having successfully thrust himself into\na leading part in the recent proceedings and made a dramatic speech,\ninflates his chest, curls his scanty moustache, and throws himself\ninto a swaggering pose, chin up and right foot forward, despising the\nemotional English barbarians around him. Brassbound's eyes and\nthe working of his mouth show that he is infected with the general\nexcitement; but he bridles himself savagely. Redbrook, trained to affect\nindifference, grins cynically; winks at Brassbound; and finally relieves\nhimself by assuming the character of a circus ringmaster, flourishing an\nimaginary whip and egging on the rest to wilder exertions. A climax is\nreached when Drinkwater, let loose without a stain on his character for\nthe second time, is rapt by belief in his star into an ecstasy in which,\nscorning all partnership, he becomes as it were a whirling dervish,\nand executes so miraculous a clog dance that the others gradually cease\ntheir slower antics to stare at him.\n\nBRASSBOUND (tearing off his hat and striding forward as Drinkwater\ncollapses, exhausted, and is picked up by Redbrook). Now to get rid of\nthis respectable clobber and feel like a man again. Stand by, all hands,\nto jump on the captain's tall hat. (He puts the hat down and prepares to\njump on it. The effect is startling, and takes him completely aback.\nHis followers, far from appreciating his iconoclasm, are shocked into\nscandalized sobriety, except Redbrook, who is immensely tickled by their\nprudery.)\n\nDRINKWATER. Naow, look eah, kepn: that ynt rawt. Dror a lawn somewhere.\n\nJOHNSON. I say nothin agen a bit of fun, Capn, but let's be gentlemen.\n\nREDBROOK. I suggest to you, Brassbound, that the clobber belongs to Lady\nSis. Ain't you going to give it back to her?\n\nBRASSBOUND (picking up the hat and brushing the dust off it anxiously).\nThat's true. I'm a fool. All the same, she shall not see me again like\nthis. (He pulls off the coat and waistcoat together.) Does any man here\nknow how to fold up this sort of thing properly?\n\nREDBROOK. Allow me, governor. (He takes the coat and waistcoat to the\ntable, and folds them up.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (loosening his collar and the front of his shirt).\nBrandyfaced Jack: you're looking at these studs. I know what's in your\nmind.\n\nDRINKWATER (indignantly). Naow yer down't: nort a bit on it. Wot's in\nmaw mawnd is secrifawce, seolf-secrifawce.\n\nBRASSBOUND. If one brass pin of that lady's property is missing, I'll\nhang you with my own hands at the gaff of the Thanksgiving--and would,\nif she were lying under the guns of all the fleets in Europe. (He pulls\noff the shirt and stands in his blue jersey, with his hair ruffled. He\npasses his hand through it and exclaims) Now I am half a man, at any\nrate.\n\nREDBROOK. A horrible combination, governor: churchwarden from the waist\ndown, and the rest pirate. Lady Sis won't speak to you in it.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I'll change altogether. (He leaves the room to get his own\ntrousers.)\n\nREDBROOK (softly). Look here, Johnson, and gents generally. (They gather\nabout him.) Spose she takes him back to England!\n\nMARZO (trying to repeat his success). Im! Im only dam pirate. She saint,\nI tell you--no take any man nowhere.\n\nJOHNSON (severely). Don't you be a ignorant and immoral foreigner. (The\nrebuke is well received; and Marzo is hustled into the background and\nextinguished.) She won't take him for harm; but she might take him for\ngood. And then where should we be?\n\nDRINKWATER. Brarsbahnd ynt the ownly kepn in the world. Wot mikes a kepn\nis brines an knollidge o lawf. It ynt thet ther's naow sitch pusson:\nit's thet you dunno where to look fr im. (The implication that he is\nsuch a person is so intolerable that they receive it with a prolonged\nburst of booing.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (returning in his own clothes, getting into his jacket as\nhe comes). Stand by, all. (They start asunder guiltily, and wait for\norders.) Redbrook: you pack that clobber in the lady's portmanteau, and\nput it aboard the yacht for her. Johnson: you take all hands aboard the\nThanksgiving; look through the stores: weigh anchor; and make all ready\nfor sea. Then send Jack to wait for me at the slip with a boat; and give\nme a gunfire for a signal. Lose no time.\n\nJOHNSON. Ay, ay, air. All aboard, mates.\n\nALL. Ay, ay. (They rush out tumultuously.)\n\nWhen they are gone, Brassbound sits down at the end of the table, with\nhis elbows on it and his head on his fists, gloomily thinking. Then he\ntakes from the breast pocket of his jacket a leather case, from which he\nextracts a scrappy packet of dirty letters and newspaper cuttings. These\nhe throws on the table. Next comes a photograph in a cheap frame. He\nthrows it down untenderly beside the papers; then folds his arms, and\nis looking at it with grim distaste when Lady Cicely enters. His back\nis towards her; and he does not hear her. Perceiving this, she shuts the\ndoor loudly enough to attract his attention. He starts up.\n\nLADY CICELY (coming to the opposite end of the table). So you've taken\noff all my beautiful clothes!\n\nBRASSBOUND. Your brother's, you mean. A man should wear his own clothes;\nand a man should tell his own lies. I'm sorry you had to tell mine for\nme to-day.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, women spend half their lives telling little lies for\nmen, and sometimes big ones. We're used to it. But mind! I don't admit\nthat I told any to-day.\n\nBRASSBOUND. How did you square my uncle?\n\nLADY CICELY. I don't understand the expression.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I mean--\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm afraid we haven't time to go into what you mean before\nlunch. I want to speak to you about your future. May I?\n\nBRASSBOUND (darkening a little, but politely). Sit down. (She sits down.\nSo does he.)\n\nLADY CICELY. What are your plans?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I have no plans. You will hear a gun fired in the harbor\npresently. That will mean that the Thanksgiving's anchor's weighed and\nthat she is waiting for her captain to put out to sea. And her captain\ndoesn't know now whether to turn her head north or south.\n\nLADY CICELY. Why not north for England?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Why not south for the Pole?\n\nLADY CICELY. But you must do something with yourself.\n\nBRASSBOUND (settling himself with his fists and elbows weightily on the\ntable and looking straight and powerfully at her). Look you: when you\nand I first met, I was a man with a purpose. I stood alone: I saddled\nno friend, woman or man, with that purpose, because it was against law,\nagainst religion, against my own credit and safety. But I believed in\nit; and I stood alone for it, as a man should stand for his belief,\nagainst law and religion as much as against wickedness and selfishness.\nWhatever I may be, I am none of your fairweather sailors that'll do\nnothing for their creed but go to Heaven for it. I was ready to go to\nhell for mine. Perhaps you don't understand that.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh bless you, yes. It's so very like a certain sort of man.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I daresay but I've not met many of that sort. Anyhow,\nthat was what I was like. I don't say I was happy in it; but I wasn't\nunhappy, because I wasn't drifting. I was steering a course and had work\nin hand. Give a man health and a course to steer; and he'll never stop\nto trouble about whether he's happy or not.\n\nLADY CICELY. Sometimes he won't even stop to trouble about whether other\npeople are happy or not.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I don't deny that: nothing makes a man so selfish as work.\nBut I was not self-seeking: it seemed to me that I had put justice above\nself. I tell you life meant something to me then. Do you see that dirty\nlittle bundle of scraps of paper?\n\nLADY CICELY. What are they?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Accounts cut out of newspapers. Speeches made by my uncle\nat charitable dinners, or sentencing men to death--pious, highminded\nspeeches by a man who was to me a thief and a murderer! To my mind they\nwere more weighty, more momentous, better revelations of the wickedness\nof law and respectability than the book of the prophet Amos. What are\nthey now? (He quietly tears the newspaper cuttings into little fragments\nand throws them away, looking fixedly at her meanwhile.)\n\nLADY CICELY. Well, that's a comfort, at all events.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Yes; but it's a part of my life gone: YOUR doing, remember.\nWhat have I left? See here! (He take up the letters) the letters\nmy uncle wrote to my mother, with her comments on their cold drawn\ninsolence, their treachery and cruelty. And the piteous letters she\nwrote to him later on, returned unopened. Must they go too?\n\nLADY CICELY (uneasily). I can't ask you to destroy your mother's\nletters.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Why not, now that you have taken the meaning out of them?\n(He tears them.) Is that a comfort too?\n\nLADY CICELY. It's a little sad; but perhaps it is best so.\n\nBRASSBOUND. That leaves one relic: her portrait. (He plucks the\nphotograph out of its cheap case.)\n\nLADY CICELY (with vivid curiosity). Oh, let me see. (He hands it to\nher. Before she can control herself, her expression changes to one of\nunmistakable disappointment and repulsion.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (with a single sardonic cachinnation). Ha! You expected\nsomething better than that. Well, you're right. Her face does not look\nwell opposite yours.\n\nLADY CICELY (distressed). I said nothing.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What could you say? (He takes back the portrait: she\nrelinquishes it without a word. He looks at it; shakes his head; and\ntakes it quietly between his finger and thumb to tear it.)\n\nLADY CICELY (staying his hand). Oh, not your mother's picture!\n\nBRASSBOUND. If that were your picture, would you like your son to keep\nit for younger and better women to see?\n\nLADY CICELY (releasing his hand). Oh, you are dreadful! Tear it, tear\nit. (She covers her eyes for a moment to shut out the sight.)\n\nBRASSBOUND (tearing it quietly). You killed her for me that day in the\ncastle; and I am better without her. (He throws away the fragments.) Now\neverything is gone. You have taken the old meaning out of my life; but\nyou have put no new meaning into it. I can see that you have some clue\nto the world that makes all its difficulties easy for you; but I'm not\nclever enough to seize it. You've lamed me by showing me that I take\nlife the wrong way when I'm left to myself.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh no. Why do you say that?\n\nBRASSBOUND. What else can I say? See what I've done! My uncle is no\nworse a man than myself--better, most likely; for he has a better head\nand a higher place. Well, I took him for a villain out of a storybook.\nMy mother would have opened anybody else's eyes: she shut mine. I'm\na stupider man than Brandyfaced Jack even; for he got his romantic\nnonsense out of his penny numbers and such like trash; but I got just\nthe same nonsense out of life and experience. (Shaking his head) It was\nvulgar--VULGAR. I see that now; for you've opened my eyes to the past;\nbut what good is that for the future? What am I to do? Where am I to go?\n\nLADY CICELY. It's quite simple. Do whatever you like. That's what I\nalways do.\n\nBRASSBOUND. That answer is no good to me. What I like is to have\nsomething to do; and I have nothing. You might as well talk like the\nmissionary and tell me to do my duty.\n\nLADY CICELY (quickly). Oh no thank you. I've had quite enough of your\nduty, and Howard's duty. Where would you both be now if I'd let you do\nit?\n\nBRASSBOUND. We'd have been somewhere, at all events. It seems to me that\nnow I am nowhere.\n\nLADY CICELY. But aren't you coming back to England with us?\n\nBRASSBOUND. What for?\n\nLADY CICELY. Why, to make the most of your opportunities.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What opportunities?\n\nLADY CICELY. Don't you understand that when you are the nephew of a\ngreat bigwig, and have influential connexions, and good friends among\nthem, lots of things can be done for you that are never done for\nordinary ship captains?\n\nBRASSBOUND. Ah; but I'm not an aristocrat, you see. And like most poor\nmen, I'm proud. I don't like being patronized.\n\nLADY CICELY. What is the use of saying that? In my world, which is now\nyour world--OUR world--getting patronage is the whole art of life. A man\ncan't have a career without it.\n\nBRASSBOUND. In my world a man can navigate a ship and get his living by\nit.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, I see you're one of the Idealists--the Impossibilists!\nWe have them, too, occasionally, in our world. There's only one thing to\nbe done with them.\n\nBRASSBOUND. What's that?\n\nLADY CICELY. Marry them straight off to some girl with enough money for\nthem, and plenty of sentiment. That's their fate.\n\nBRASSBOUND. You've spoiled even that chance for me. Do you think I could\nlook at any ordinary woman after you? You seem to be able to make me\ndo pretty well what you like; but you can't make me marry anybody but\nyourself.\n\nLADY CICELY. Do you know, Captain Paquito, that I've married no less\nthan seventeen men (Brassbound stares) to other women. And they all\nopened the subject by saying that they would never marry anybody but me.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Then I shall be the first man you ever found to stand to his\nword.\n\nLADY CICELY (part pleased, part amused, part sympathetic). Do you really\nwant a wife?\n\nBRASSBOUND. I want a commander. Don't undervalue me: I am a good man\nwhen I have a good leader. I have courage: I have determination: I'm not\na drinker: I can command a schooner and a shore party if I can't command\na ship or an army. When work is put upon me, I turn neither to save my\nlife nor to fill my pocket. Gordon trusted me; and he never regretted\nit. If you trust me, you shan't regret it. All the same, there's\nsomething wanting in me: I suppose I'm stupid.\n\nLADY CICELY. Oh, you're not stupid.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Yes I am. Since you saw me for the first time in that\ngarden, you've heard me say nothing clever. And I've heard you say\nnothing that didn't make me laugh, or make me feel friendly, as well\nas telling me what to think and what to do. That's what I mean by real\ncleverness. Well, I haven't got it. I can give an order when I know what\norder to give. I can make men obey it, willing or unwilling. But I'm\nstupid, I tell you: stupid. When there's no Gordon to command me, I\ncan't think of what to do. Left to myself, I've become half a brigand.\nI can kick that little gutterscrub Drinkwater; but I find myself doing\nwhat he puts into my head because I can't think of anything else. When\nyou came, I took your orders as naturally as I took Gordon's, though\nI little thought my next commander would be a woman. I want to take\nservice under you. And there's no way in which that can be done except\nmarrying you. Will you let me do it?\n\nLADY CICELY. I'm afraid you don't quite know how odd a match it would be\nfor me according to the ideas of English society.\n\nBRASSBOUND. I care nothing about English society: let it mind its own\nbusiness.\n\nLADY CICELY (rising, a little alarmed). Captain Paquito: I am not in\nlove with you.\n\nBRASSBOUND (also rising, with his gaze still steadfastly on her). I\ndidn't suppose you were: the commander is not usually in love with his\nsubordinate.\n\nLADY CICELY. Nor the subordinate with the commander.\n\nBRASSBOUND (assenting firmly). Nor the subordinate with the commander.\n\nLADY CICELY (learning for the first time in her life what terror is,\nas she finds that he is unconsciously mesmerizing her). Oh, you are\ndangerous!\n\nBRASSBOUND. Come: are you in love with anybody else? That's the\nquestion.\n\nLADY CICELY (shaking her head). I have never been in love with any real\nperson; and I never shall. How could I manage people if I had that mad\nlittle bit of self left in me? That's my secret.\n\nBRASSBOUND. Then throw away the last bit of self. Marry me.\n\nLADY CICELY (vainly struggling to recall her wandering will). Must I?\n\nBRASSBOUND. There is no must. You CAN. I ask you to. My fate depends on\nit.\n\nLADY CICELY. It's frightful; for I don't mean to--don't wish to.\n\nBRASSBOUND. But you will.\n\nLADY CICELY (quite lost, slowly stretches out her hand to give it to\nhim). I-- (Gunfire from the Thanksgiving. His eyes dilate. It wakes her\nfrom her trance) What is that?\n\nBRASSBOUND. It is farewell. Rescue for you--safety, freedom! You were\nmade to be something better than the wife of Black Paquito. (He kneels\nand takes her hands) You can do no more for me now: I have blundered\nsomehow on the secret of command at last (he kisses her hands): thanks\nfor that, and for a man's power and purpose restored and righted. And\nfarewell, farewell, farewell.\n\nLADY CICELY (in a strange ecstasy, holding his hands as he rises). Oh,\nfarewell. With my heart's deepest feeling, farewell, farewell.\n\nBRASSBOUND. With my heart's noblest honor and triumph, farewell. (He\nturns and flies.)\n\nLADY CICELY. How glorious! how glorious! And what an escape!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nNOTES TO CAPTAIN BRASSBOUND'S CONVERSION\n\nSOURCES OF THE PLAY\n\nI claim as a notable merit in the authorship of this play that I have\nbeen intelligent enough to steal its scenery, its surroundings, its\natmosphere, its geography, its knowledge of the east, its fascinating\nCadis and Kearneys and Sheikhs and mud castles from an excellent book of\nphilosophic travel and vivid adventure entitled Mogreb-el-Acksa (Morocco\nthe Most Holy) by Cunninghame Graham. My own first hand knowledge of\nMorocco is based on a morning's walk through Tangier, and a cursory\nobservation of the coast through a binocular from the deck of an Orient\nsteamer, both later in date than the writing of the play.\n\nCunninghame Graham is the hero of his own book; but I have not made\nhim the hero of my play, because so incredible a personage must have\ndestroyed its likelihood--such as it is. There are moments when I do\nnot myself believe in his existence. And yet he must be real; for I have\nseen him with these eyes; and I am one of the few men living who can\ndecipher the curious alphabet in which he writes his private letters.\nThe man is on public record too. The battle of Trafalgar Square, in\nwhich he personally and bodily assailed civilization as represented by\nthe concentrated military and constabular forces of the capital of the\nworld, can scarcely be forgotten by the more discreet spectators,\nof whom I was one. On that occasion civilization, qualitatively his\ninferior, was quantitatively so hugely in excess of him that it put him\nin prison, but had not sense enough to keep him there. Yet his getting\nout of prison was as nothing compared to his getting into the House of\nCommons. How he did it I know not; but the thing certainly happened,\nsomehow. That he made pregnant utterances as a legislator may be taken\nas proved by the keen philosophy of the travels and tales he has since\ntossed to us; but the House, strong in stupidity, did not understand\nhim until in an inspired moment he voiced a universal impulse by bluntly\ndamning its hypocrisy. Of all the eloquence of that silly parliament,\nthere remains only one single damn. It has survived the front bench\nspeeches of the eighties as the word of Cervantes survives the\noraculations of the Dons and Deys who put him, too, in prison. The\nshocked House demanded that he should withdraw his cruel word. \"I never\nwithdraw,\" said he; and I promptly stole the potent phrase for the sake\nof its perfect style, and used it as a cockade for the Bulgarian hero\nof Arms and the Man. The theft prospered; and I naturally take the first\nopportunity of repeating it. In what other Lepantos besides Trafalgar\nSquare Cunninghame Graham has fought, I cannot tell. He is a fascinating\nmystery to a sedentary person like myself. The horse, a dangerous\nanimal whom, when I cannot avoid, I propitiate with apples and sugar, he\nbestrides and dominates fearlessly, yet with a true republican sense of\nthe rights of the fourlegged fellowcreature whose martyrdom, and man's\nshame therein, he has told most powerfully in his Calvary, a tale with\nan edge that will cut the soft cruel hearts and strike fire from the\nhard kind ones. He handles the other lethal weapons as familiarly as the\npen: medieval sword and modern Mauser are to him as umbrellas and kodaks\nare to me. His tales of adventure have the true Cervantes touch of\nthe man who has been there--so refreshingly different from the scenes\nimagined by bloody-minded clerks who escape from their servitude into\nliterature to tell us how men and cities are conceived in the counting\nhouse and the volunteer corps. He is, I understand, a Spanish hidalgo:\nhence the superbity of his portrait by Lavery (Velasquez being no\nlonger available). He is, I know, a Scotch laird. How he contrives to be\nauthentically the two things at the same time is no more intelligible to\nme than the fact that everything that has ever happened to him seems to\nhave happened in Paraguay or Texas instead of in Spain or Scotland. He\nis, I regret to add, an impenitent and unashamed dandy: such boots, such\na hat, would have dazzled D'Orsay himself. With that hat he once saluted\nme in Regent St. when I was walking with my mother. Her interest was\ninstantly kindled; and the following conversation ensued. \"Who is that?\"\n\"Cunninghame Graham.\" \"Nonsense! Cunninghame Graham is one of your\nSocialists: that man is a gentleman.\" This is the punishment of vanity,\na fault I have myself always avoided, as I find conceit less troublesome\nand much less expensive. Later on somebody told him of Tarudant, a city\nin Morocco in which no Christian had ever set foot. Concluding at once\nthat it must be an exceptionally desirable place to live in, he took\nship and horse: changed the hat for a turban; and made straight for the\nsacred city, via Mogador. How he fared, and how he fell into the hands\nof the Cadi of Kintafi, who rightly held that there was more danger to\nIslam in one Cunninghame Graham than in a thousand Christians, may be\nlearnt from his account of it in Mogreb-el-Acksa, without which Captain\nBrassbound's Conversion would never have been written.\n\nI am equally guiltless of any exercise of invention concerning the story\nof the West Indian estate which so very nearly serves as a peg to hang\nCaptain Brassbound. To Mr. Frederick Jackson of Hindhead, who, against\nall his principles, encourages and abets me in my career as a dramatist,\nI owe my knowledge of those main facts of the case which became public\nthrough an attempt to make the House of Commons act on them. This being\nso, I must add that the character of Captain Brassbound's mother, like\nthe recovery of the estate by the next heir, is an interpolation of my\nown. It is not, however, an invention. One of the evils of the pretence\nthat our institutions represent abstract principles of justice\ninstead of being mere social scaffolding is that persons of a certain\ntemperament take the pretence seriously, and when the law is on the side\nof injustice, will not accept the situation, and are driven mad by their\nvain struggle against it. Dickens has drawn the type in his Man from\nShropshire in Bleak House. Most public men and all lawyers have been\nappealed to by victims of this sense of injustice--the most unhelpable\nof afflictions in a society like ours.\n\nENGLISH AND AMERICAN DIALECTS\n\nThe fact that English is spelt conventionally and not phonetically makes\nthe art of recording speech almost impossible. What is more, it places\nthe modern dramatist, who writes for America as well as England, in\na most trying position. Take for example my American captain and my\nEnglish lady. I have spelt the word conduce, as uttered by the\nAmerican captain, as cawndooce, to suggest (very roughly) the American\npronunciation to English readers. Then why not spell the same word,\nwhen uttered by Lady Cicely, as kerndewce, to suggest the English\npronunciation to American readers? To this I have absolutely no defence:\nI can only plead that an author who lives in England necessarily loses\nhis consciousness of the peculiarities of English speech, and sharpens\nhis consciousness of the points in which American speech differs from\nit; so that it is more convenient to leave English peculiarities to be\nrecorded by American authors. I must, however, most vehemently disclaim\nany intention of suggesting that English pronunciation is authoritative\nand correct. My own tongue is neither American English nor English\nEnglish, but Irish English; so I am as nearly impartial in the matter\nas it is in human nature to be. Besides, there is no standard English\npronunciation any more than there is an American one: in England every\ncounty has its catchwords, just as no doubt every state in the Union\nhas. I cannot believe that the pioneer American, for example, can spare\ntime to learn that last refinement of modern speech, the exquisite\ndiphthong, a farfetched combination of the French eu and the English e,\nwith which a New Yorker pronounces such words as world, bird &c. I have\nspent months without success in trying to achieve glibness with it.\n\nTo Felix Drinkwater also I owe some apology for implying that all his\nvowel pronunciations are unfashionable. They are very far from being so.\nAs far as my social experience goes (and I have kept very mixed company)\nthere is no class in English society in which a good deal of Drinkwater\npronunciation does not pass unchallenged save by the expert phonetician.\nThis is no mere rash and ignorant jibe of my own at the expense of my\nEnglish neighbors. Academic authority in the matter of English speech is\nrepresented at present by Mr. Henry Sweet, of the University of Oxford,\nwhose Elementarbuch des gesprochenen Engliach, translated into his\nnative language for the use of British islanders as a Primer of Spoken\nEnglish, is the most accessible standard work on the subject. In such\nwords as plum, come, humbug, up, gum, etc., Mr. Sweet's evidence is\nconclusive. Ladies and gentlemen in Southern England pronounce them as\nplam, kam, hambag, ap, gan, etc., exactly as Felix Drinkwater does. I\ncould not claim Mr. Sweet's authority if I dared to whisper that such\ncoster English as the rather pretty dahn tahn for down town, or the\ndecidedly ugly cowcow for cocoa is current in very polite circles. The\nentire nation, costers and all, would undoubtedly repudiate any such\npronunciation as vulgar. All the same, if I were to attempt to represent\ncurrent \"smart\" cockney speech as I have attempted to represent\nDrinkwater's, without the niceties of Mr. Sweet's Romic alphabets, I\nam afraid I should often have to write dahn tahn and cowcow as being\nat least nearer to the actual sound than down town and cocoa. And this\nwould give such offence that I should have to leave the country; for\nnothing annoys a native speaker of English more than a faithful setting\ndown in phonetic spelling of the sounds he utters. He imagines that\na departure from conventional spelling indicates a departure from the\ncorrect standard English of good society. Alas! this correct standard\nEnglish of good society is unknown to phoneticians. It is only one of\nthe many figments that bewilder our poor snobbish brains. No such thing\nexists; but what does that matter to people trained from infancy to make\na point of honor of belief in abstractions and incredibilities? And so I\nam compelled to hide Lady Cicely's speech under the veil of conventional\northography.\n\nI need not shield Drinkwater, because he will never read my book. So\nI have taken the liberty of making a special example of him, as far as\nthat can be done without a phonetic alphabet, for the benefit of the\nmass of readers outside London who still form their notions of cockney\ndialect on Sam Weller. When I came to London in 1876, the Sam Weller\ndialect had passed away so completely that I should have given it up as\na literary fiction if I had not discovered it surviving in a Middlesex\nvillage, and heard of it from an Essex one. Some time in the eighties\nthe late Andrew Tuer called attention in the Pall Mall Gazette to\nseveral peculiarities of modern cockney, and to the obsolescence of the\nDickens dialect that was still being copied from book to book by authors\nwho never dreamt of using their ears, much less of training them to\nlisten. Then came Mr. Anstey's cockney dialogues in Punch, a great\nadvance, and Mr. Chevalier's coster songs and patter. The Tompkins\nverses contributed by Mr. Barry Pain to the London Daily Chronicle have\nalso done something to bring the literary convention for cockney English\nup to date. But Tompkins sometimes perpetrates horrible solecisms. He\nwill pronounce face as fits, accurately enough; but he will rhyme it\nquite impossibly to nice, which Tompkins would pronounce as newts: for\nexample Mawl Enn Rowd for Mile End Road. This aw for i, which I have\nmade Drinkwater use, is the latest stage of the old diphthongal oi,\nwhich Mr. Chevalier still uses. Irish, Scotch and north country readers\nmust remember that Drinkwater's rs are absolutely unpronounced when they\nfollow a vowel, though they modify the vowel very considerably. Thus,\nluggage is pronounced by him as laggige, but turn is not pronounced as\ntern, but as teun with the eu sounded as in French. The London r seems\nthoroughly understood in America, with the result, however, that the use\nof the r by Artemus Ward and other American dialect writers causes Irish\npeople to misread them grotesquely. I once saw the pronunciation of\nmalheureux represented in a cockney handbook by mal-err-err: not at\nall a bad makeshift to instruct a Londoner, but out of the question\nelsewhere in the British Isles. In America, representations of English\nspeech dwell too derisively on the dropped or interpolated h. American\nwriters have apparently not noticed the fact that the south English h\nis not the same as the never-dropped Irish and American h, and that to\nridicule an Englishman for dropping it is as absurd as to ridicule the\nwhole French and Italian nation for doing the same. The American\nh, helped out by a general agreement to pronounce wh as hw, is\ntempestuously audible, and cannot be dropped without being immediately\nmissed. The London h is so comparatively quiet at all times, and so\ncompletely inaudible in wh, that it probably fell out of use simply by\nescaping the ears of children learning to speak. However that may be, it\nis kept alive only by the literate classes who are reminded constantly\nof its existence by seeing it on paper.\n\nRoughly speaking, I should say that in England he who bothers about\nhis hs is a fool, and he who ridicules a dropped h a snob. As to the\ninterpolated h, my experience as a London vestryman has convinced me\nthat it is often effective as a means of emphasis, and that the London\nlanguage would be poorer without it. The objection to it is no more\nrespectable than the objection of a street boy to a black man or to a\nlady in knickerbockers.\n\nI have made only the most perfunctory attempt to represent the dialect\nof the missionary. There is no literary notation for the grave music of\ngood Scotch.\n\nBLACKDOWN, August 1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Captain Brassbound's Conversion, by \nGeorge Bernard Shaw\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAPTAIN BRASSBOUND'S CONVERSION ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3418-8.txt or 3418-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/1\/3418\/\n\nProduced by Eve Sobol\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1374,"split":"test"}
