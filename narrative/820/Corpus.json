His grandfather Jehann Daas, who lives in a small village near the city of Antwerp, takes him in.\nOne day, Nello and Jehann Daas find a dog who was almost beaten to death, and name him Patrasche. Due to the good care of Jehann Daas, the dog recovers, and from then on, Nello and Patrasche are inseparable. Since they are very poor, Nello has to help his grandfather by selling milk. Patrasche helps Nello pull their cart into town each morning.\nNello falls in love with Aloise, the daughter of Nicholas Cogez, a well-off man in the village, but Nicholas doesn't want his daughter to have a poor sweetheart. Although Nello is illiterate, he is very talented in drawing. He enters a junior drawing contest in Antwerp, hoping to win the first prize, 200 francs per year. However, the jury selects somebody else.\nAfterwards, he is accused of causing a fire by Nicholas (the fire occurred on his property) and his grandfather dies. His life becomes even more desperate. Having no place to stay, Nello wishes to go to the cathedral of Antwerp (see Rubens' The Elevation of the Cross and The Descent of the Cross), but the exhibition held inside the building is only for paying customers and he's out of money. On the night of Christmas Eve, he and Patrasche go to Antwerp and, by chance, find the door to the church open. The next morning, the boy and his dog are found frozen to death in front of the triptych.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's A Dog of Flanders, by Louisa de la Ram\u00c3\u00aa, AKA \u00c3\u0093uida\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Nello was\na little Ardennois--Patrasche was a big Fleming. They were both of the\nsame age by length of years, yet one was still young, and the other was\nalready old. They had dwelt together almost all their days: both were\norphaned and destitute, and owed their lives to the same hand. It\nhad been the beginning of the tie between them, their first bond of\nsympathy; and it had strengthened day by day, and had grown with\ntheir growth, firm and indissoluble, until they loved one another very\ngreatly. Their home was a little hut on the edge of a little village--a\nFlemish village a league from Antwerp, set amidst flat breadths of\npasture and corn-lands, with long lines of poplars and of alders bending\nin the breeze on the edge of the great canal which ran through it. It\nhad about a score of houses and homesteads, with shutters of bright\ngreen or sky-blue, and roofs rose-red or black and white, and walls\nwhite-washed until they shone in the sun like snow. In the centre of the\nvillage stood a windmill, placed on a little moss-grown slope: it was\na landmark to all the level country round. It had once been painted\nscarlet, sails and all, but that had been in its infancy, half a century\nor more earlier, when it had ground wheat for the soldiers of Napoleon;\nand it was now a ruddy brown, tanned by wind and weather. It went\nqueerly by fits and starts, as though rheumatic and stiff in the joints\nfrom age, but it served the whole neighborhood, which would have thought\nit almost as impious to carry grain elsewhere as to attend any other\nreligious service than the mass that was performed at the altar of the\nlittle old gray church, with its conical steeple, which stood opposite\nto it, and whose single bell rang morning, noon, and night with that\nstrange, subdued, hollow sadness which every bell that hangs in the Low\nCountries seems to gain as an integral part of its melody.\n\nWithin sound of the little melancholy clock almost from their birth\nupward, they had dwelt together, Nello and Patrasche, in the little hut\non the edge of the village, with the cathedral spire of Antwerp rising\nin the north-east, beyond the great green plain of seeding grass and\nspreading corn that stretched away from them like a tideless, changeless\nsea. It was the hut of a very old man, of a very poor man--of old Jehan\nDaas, who in his time had been a soldier, and who remembered the wars\nthat had trampled the country as oxen tread down the furrows, and who\nhad brought from his service nothing except a wound, which had made him\na cripple.\n\nWhen old Jehan Daas had reached his full eighty, his daughter had\ndied in the Ardennes, hard by Stavelot, and had left him in legacy her\ntwo-year-old son. The old man could ill contrive to support himself,\nbut he took up the additional burden uncomplainingly, and it soon\nbecame welcome and precious to him. Little Nello---which was but a pet\ndiminutive for Nicolas--throve with him, and the old man and the little\nchild lived in the poor little hut contentedly.\n\nIt was a very humble little mud-hut indeed, but it was clean and white\nas a sea-shell, and stood in a small plot of garden-ground that yielded\nbeans and herbs and pumpkins. They were very poor, terribly poor--many a\nday they had nothing at all to eat. They never by any chance had enough:\nto have had enough to eat would have been to have reached paradise at\nonce. But the old man was very gentle and good to the boy, and the boy\nwas a beautiful, innocent, truthful, tender-hearted creature; and they\nwere happy on a crust and a few leaves of cabbage, and asked no more of\nearth or heaven; save indeed that Patrasche should be always with them,\nsince without Patrasche where would they have been?\n\nFor Patrasche was their alpha and omega; their treasury and granary;\ntheir store of gold and wand of wealth; their bread-winner and minister;\ntheir only friend and comforter. Patrasche dead or gone from them, they\nmust have laid themselves down and died likewise. Patrasche was body,\nbrains, hands, head, and feet to both of them: Patrasche was their very\nlife, their very soul. For Jehan Daas was old and a cripple, and Nello\nwas but a child; and Patrasche was their dog.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA dog of Flanders--yellow of hide, large of head and limb, with\nwolf-like ears that stood erect, and legs bowed and feet widened in the\nmuscular development wrought in his breed by many generations of hard\nservice. Patrasche came of a race which had toiled hard and cruelly from\nsire to son in Flanders many a century--slaves of slaves, dogs of the\npeople, beasts of the shafts and the harness, creatures that lived\nstraining their sinews in the gall of the cart, and died breaking their\nhearts on the flints of the streets.\n\nPatrasche had been born of parents who had labored hard all their\ndays over the sharp-set stones of the various cities and the long,\nshadowless, weary roads of the two Flanders and of Brabant. He had been\nborn to no other heritage than those of pain and of toil. He had been\nfed on curses and baptized with blows. Why not? It was a Christian\ncountry, and Patrasche was but a dog. Before he was fully grown he had\nknown the bitter gall of the cart and the collar. Before he had entered\nhis thirteenth month he had become the property of a hardware-dealer,\nwho was accustomed to wander over the land north and south, from the\nblue sea to the green mountains. They sold him for a small price,\nbecause he was so young.\n\nThis man was a drunkard and a brute. The life of Patrasche was a life of\nhell. To deal the tortures of hell on the animal creation is a way which\nthe Christians have of showing their belief in it. His purchaser was\na sullen, ill-living, brutal Brabantois, who heaped his cart full with\npots and pans and flagons and buckets, and other wares of crockery and\nbrass and tin, and left Patrasche to draw the load as best he might,\nwhilst he himself lounged idly by the side in fat and sluggish ease,\nsmoking his black pipe and stopping at every wineshop or caf\u00c3\u00a9 on the\nroad.\n\nHappily for Patrasche--or unhappily--he was very strong: he came of an\niron race, long born and bred to such cruel travail; so that he did\nnot die, but managed to drag on a wretched existence under the brutal\nburdens, the scarifying lashes, the hunger, the thirst, the blows,\nthe curses, and the exhaustion which are the only wages with which the\nFlemings repay the most patient and laborious of all their four-footed\nvictims. One day, after two years of this long and deadly agony,\nPatrasche was going on as usual along one of the straight, dusty,\nunlovely roads that lead to the city of Rubens. It was full midsummer,\nand very warm. His cart was very heavy, piled high with goods in\nmetal and in earthenware. His owner sauntered on without noticing him\notherwise than by the crack of the whip as it curled round his quivering\nloins. The Brabantois had paused to drink beer himself at every wayside\nhouse, but he had forbidden Patrasche to stop a moment for a draught\nfrom the canal. Going along thus, in the full sun, on a scorching\nhighway, having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours, and, which was far\nworse to him, not having tasted water for near twelve, being blind with\ndust, sore with blows, and stupefied with the merciless weight which\ndragged upon his loins, Patrasche staggered and foamed a little at the\nmouth, and fell.\n\nHe fell in the middle of the white, dusty road, in the full glare of\nthe sun; he was sick unto death, and motionless. His master gave him the\nonly medicine in his pharmacy--kicks and oaths and blows with a cudgel\nof oak, which had been often the only food and drink, the only wage and\nreward, ever offered to him. But Patrasche was beyond the reach of any\ntorture or of any curses. Patrasche lay, dead to all appearances,\ndown in the white powder of the summer dust. After a while, finding\nit useless to assail his ribs with punishment and his ears with\nmaledictions, the Brabantois--deeming life gone in him, or going so\nnearly that his carcass was forever useless, unless indeed some one\nshould strip it of the skin for gloves--cursed him fiercely in farewell,\nstruck off the leathern bands of the harness, kicked his body aside into\nthe grass, and, groaning and muttering in savage wrath, pushed the cart\nlazily along the road up-hill, and left the dying dog for the ants to\nsting and for the crows to pick.\n\nIt was the last day before Kermesse away at Louvain, and the Brabantois\nwas in haste to reach the fair and get a good place for his truck of\nbrass wares. He was in fierce wrath, because Patrasche had been a strong\nand much-enduring animal, and because he himself had now the hard task\nof pushing his charette all the way to Louvain. But to stay to look\nafter Patrasche never entered his thoughts: the beast was dying and\nuseless, and he would steal, to replace him, the first large dog that he\nfound wandering alone out of sight of its master. Patrasche had cost him\nnothing, or next to nothing, and for two long, cruel years had made him\ntoil ceaselessly in his service from sunrise to sunset, through summer\nand winter, in fair weather and foul.\n\nHe had got a fair use and a good profit out of Patrasche: being human,\nhe was wise, and left the dog to draw his last breath alone in the\nditch, and have his bloodshot eyes plucked out as they might be by the\nbirds, whilst he himself went on his way to beg and to steal, to eat and\nto drink, to dance and to sing, in the mirth at Louvain. A dying dog, a\ndog of the cart--why should he waste hours over its agonies at peril of\nlosing a handful of copper coins, at peril of a shout of laughter?\n\nPatrasche lay there, flung in the grass-green ditch. It was a busy road\nthat day, and hundreds of people, on foot and on mules, in wagons or in\ncarts, went by, tramping quickly and joyously on to Louvain. Some saw\nhim, most did not even look: all passed on. A dead dog more or less--it\nwas nothing in Brabant: it would be nothing anywhere in the world.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAfter a time, among the holiday-makers, there came a little old man who\nwas bent and lame, and very feeble. He was in no guise for feasting: he\nwas very poorly and miserably clad, and he dragged his silent way slowly\nthrough the dust among the pleasure-seekers. He looked at Patrasche,\npaused, wondered, turned aside, then kneeled down in the rank grass and\nweeds of the ditch, and surveyed the dog with kindly eyes of pity. There\nwas with him a little rosy, fair-haired, dark-eyed child of a few years\nold, who pattered in amidst the bushes, for him breast-high, and stood\ngazing with a pretty seriousness upon the poor, great, quiet beast.\n\nThus it was that these two first met--the little Nello and the big\nPatrasche.\n\nThe upshot of that day was, that old Jehan Daas, with much laborious\neffort, drew the sufferer homeward to his own little hut, which was a\nstone's throw off amidst the fields, and there tended him with so much\ncare that the sickness, which had been a brain seizure, brought on by\nheat and thirst and exhaustion, with time and shade and rest passed\naway, and health and strength returned, and Patrasche staggered up again\nupon his four stout, tawny legs.\n\nNow for many weeks he had been useless, powerless, sore, near to death;\nbut all this time he had heard no rough word, had felt no harsh touch,\nbut only the pitying murmurs of the child's voice and the soothing\ncaress of the old man's hand.\n\nIn his sickness they too had grown to care for him, this lonely man and\nthe little happy child. He had a corner of the hut, with a heap of\ndry grass for his bed; and they had learned to listen eagerly for his\nbreathing in the dark night, to tell them that he lived; and when he\nfirst was well enough to essay a loud, hollow, broken bay, they laughed\naloud, and almost wept together for joy at such a sign of his sure\nrestoration; and little Nello, in delighted glee, hung round his rugged\nneck with chains of marguerites, and kissed him with fresh and ruddy\nlips.\n\nSo then, when Patrasche arose, himself again, strong, big, gaunt,\npowerful, his great wistful eyes had a gentle astonishment in them that\nthere were no curses to rouse him and no blows to drive him; and\nhis heart awakened to a mighty love, which never wavered once in its\nfidelity whilst life abode with him.\n\nBut Patrasche, being a dog, was grateful. Patrasche lay pondering long\nwith grave, tender, musing brown eyes, watching the movements of his\nfriends.\n\nNow, the old soldier, Jehan Daas, could do nothing for his living but\nlimp about a little with a small cart, with which he carried daily the\nmilk-cans of those happier neighbors who owned cattle away into the\ntown of Antwerp. The villagers gave him the employment a little out of\ncharity--more because it suited them well to send their milk into the\ntown by so honest a carrier, and bide at home themselves to look after\ntheir gardens, their cows, their poultry, or their little fields. But it\nwas becoming hard work for the old man. He was eighty-three, and Antwerp\nwas a good league off, or more.\n\nPatrasche watched the milk-cans come and go that one day when he had got\nwell and was lying in the sun with the wreath of marguerites round his\ntawny neck.\n\nThe next morning, Patrasche, before the old man had touched the cart,\narose and walked to it and placed himself betwixt its handles, and\ntestified as plainly as dumb show could do his desire and his ability\nto work in return for the bread of charity that he had eaten. Jehan Daas\nresisted long, for the old man was one of those who thought it a foul\nshame to bind dogs to labor for which Nature never formed them. But\nPatrasche would not be gainsaid: finding they did not harness him, he\ntried to draw the cart onward with his teeth.\n\nAt length Jehan Daas gave way, vanquished by the persistence and the\ngratitude of this creature whom he had succored. He fashioned his cart\nso that Patrasche could run in it, and this he did every morning of his\nlife thenceforward.\n\nWhen the winter came, Jehan Daas thanked the blessed fortune that had\nbrought him to the dying dog in the ditch that fair-day of Louvain; for\nhe was very old, and he grew feebler with each year, and he would ill\nhave known how to pull his load of milk-cans over the snows and through\nthe deep ruts in the mud if it had not been for the strength and the\nindustry of the animal he had befriended. As for Patrasche, it seemed\nheaven to him. After the frightful burdens that his old master had\ncompelled him to strain under, at the call of the whip at every step, it\nseemed nothing to him but amusement to step out with this little light\ngreen cart, with its bright brass cans, by the side of the gentle old\nman who always paid him with a tender caress and with a kindly word.\nBesides, his work was over by three or four in the day, and after that\ntime he was free to do as he would--to stretch himself, to sleep in the\nsun, to wander in the fields, to romp with the young child, or to play\nwith his fellow-dogs. Patrasche was very happy.\n\nFortunately for his peace, his former owner was killed in a drunken\nbrawl at the Kermesse of Mechlin, and so sought not after him nor\ndisturbed him in his new and well-loved home.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA few years later, old Jehan Daas, who had always been a cripple, became\nso paralyzed with rheumatism that it was impossible for him to go out\nwith the cart any more. Then little Nello, being now grown to his sixth\nyear of age, and knowing the town well from having accompanied his\ngrandfather so many times, took his place beside the cart, and sold the\nmilk and received the coins in exchange, and brought them back to their\nrespective owners with a pretty grace and seriousness which charmed all\nwho beheld him.\n\nThe little Ardennois was a beautiful child, with dark, grave, tender\neyes, and a lovely bloom upon his face, and fair locks that clustered to\nhis throat; and many an artist sketched the group as it went by him--the\ngreen cart with the brass flagons of Teniers and Mieris and Van Tal,\nand the great tawny-colored, massive dog, with his belled harness that\nchimed cheerily as he went, and the small figure that ran beside him\nwhich had little white feet in great wooden shoes, and a soft, grave,\ninnocent, happy face like the little fair children of Rubens.\n\nNello and Patrasche did the work so well and so joyfully together that\nJehan Daas himself, when the summer came and he was better again, had no\nneed to stir out, but could sit in the doorway in the sun and see them\ngo forth through the garden wicket, and then doze and dream and pray\na little, and then awake again as the clock tolled three and watch for\ntheir return. And on their return Patrasche would shake himself free of\nhis harness with a bay of glee, and Nello would recount with pride the\ndoings of the day; and they would all go in together to their meal of\nrye bread and milk or soup, and would see the shadows lengthen over the\ngreat plain, and see the twilight veil the fair cathedral spire; and\nthen lie down together to sleep peacefully while the old man said a\nprayer. So the days and the years went on, and the lives of Nello and\nPatrasche were happy, innocent, and healthful. In the spring and summer\nespecially were they glad. Flanders is not a lovely land, and around\nthe burgh of Rubens it is perhaps least lovely of all. Corn and colza,\npasture and plough, succeed each other on the characterless plain in\nwearying repetition, and save by some gaunt gray tower, with its peal\nof pathetic bells, or some figure coming athwart the fields, made\npicturesque by a gleaner's bundle or a woodman's fagot, there is no\nchange, no variety, no beauty anywhere; and he who has dwelt upon the\nmountains or amidst the forests feels oppressed as by imprisonment with\nthe tedium and the endlessness of that vast and dreary level. But it\nis green and very fertile, and it has wide horizons that have a certain\ncharm of their own even in their dulness and monotony; and among the\nrushes by the water-side the flowers grow, and the trees rise tall and\nfresh where the barges glide with their great hulks black against the\nsun, and their little green barrels and vari-colored flags gay against\nthe leaves. Anyway, there is greenery and breadth of space enough to be\nas good as beauty to a child and a dog; and these two asked no better,\nwhen their work was done, than to lie buried in the lush grasses on the\nside of the canal, and watch the cumbrous vessels drifting by and bring\nthe crisp salt smell of the sea among the blossoming scents of the\ncountry summer.\n\nTrue, in the winter it was harder, and they had to rise in the darkness\nand the bitter cold, and they had seldom as much as they could have\neaten any day, and the hut was scarce better than a shed when the nights\nwere cold, although it looked so pretty in warm weather, buried in a\ngreat kindly clambering vine, that never bore fruit, indeed, but which\ncovered it with luxuriant green tracery all through the months of\nblossom and harvest. In winter the winds found many holes in the walls\nof the poor little hut, and the vine was black and leafless, and the\nbare lands looked very bleak and drear without, and sometimes within the\nfloor was flooded and then frozen. In winter it was hard, and the snow\nnumbed the little white limbs of Nello, and the icicles cut the brave,\nuntiring feet of Patrasche.\n\nBut even then they were never heard to lament, either of them. The\nchild's wooden shoes and the dog's four legs would trot manfully\ntogether over the frozen fields to the chime of the bells on the\nharness; and then sometimes, in the streets of Antwerp, some housewife\nwould bring them a bowl of soup and a handful of bread, or some kindly\ntrader would throw some billets of fuel into the little cart as it went\nhomeward, or some woman in their own village would bid them keep a share\nof the milk they carried for their own food; and they would run over\nthe white lands, through the early darkness, bright and happy, and burst\nwith a shout of joy into their home.\n\nSo, on the whole, it was well with them, very well; and Patrasche,\nmeeting on the highway or in the public streets the many dogs who toiled\nfrom daybreak into nightfall, paid only with blows and curses, and\nloosened from the shafts with a kick to starve and freeze as best they\nmight--Patrasche in his heart was very grateful to his fate, and thought\nit the fairest and the kindliest the world could hold. Though he was\noften very hungry indeed when he lay down at night; though he had to\nwork in the heats of summer noons and the rasping chills of winter\ndawns; though his feet were often tender with wounds from the sharp\nedges of the jagged pavement; though he had to perform tasks beyond his\nstrength and against his nature--yet he was grateful and content: he did\nhis duty with each day, and the eyes that he loved smiled down on him.\nIt was sufficient for Patrasche.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was only one thing which caused Patrasche any uneasiness in his\nlife, and it was this. Antwerp, as all the world knows, is full at every\nturn of old piles of stones, dark and ancient and majestic, standing\nin crooked courts, jammed against gateways and taverns, rising by the\nwater's edge, with bells ringing above them in the air, and ever and\nagain out of their arched doors a swell of music pealing. There they\nremain, the grand old sanctuaries of the past, shut in amidst the\nsqualor, the hurry, the crowds, the unloveliness, and the commerce of\nthe modern world, and all day long the clouds drift and the birds circle\nand the winds sigh around them, and beneath the earth at their feet\nthere sleeps--RUBENS.\n\nAnd the greatness of the mighty Master still rests upon Antwerp, and\nwherever we turn in its narrow streets his glory lies therein, so that\nall mean things are thereby transfigured; and as we pace slowly through\nthe winding ways, and by the edge of the stagnant water, and through the\nnoisome courts, his spirit abides with us, and the heroic beauty of his\nvisions is about us, and the stones that once felt his footsteps and\nbore his shadow seem to arise and speak of him with living voices. For\nthe city which is the tomb of Rubens still lives to us through him, and\nhim alone.\n\nIt is so quiet there by that great white sepulchre--so quiet, save only\nwhen the organ peals and the choir cries aloud the Salve Regina or the\nKyrie Eleison. Sure no artist ever had a greater gravestone than that\npure marble sanctuary gives to him in the heart of his birthplace in the\nchancel of St. Jacques.\n\nWithout Rubens, what were Antwerp? A dirty, dusky, bustling mart, which\nno man would ever care to look upon save the traders who do business on\nits wharves. With Rubens, to the whole world of men it is a sacred name,\na sacred soil, a Bethlehem where a god of Art saw light, a Golgotha\nwhere a god of Art lies dead.\n\nO nations! closely should you treasure your great men, for by them alone\nwill the future know of you. Flanders in her generations has been wise.\nIn his life she glorified this greatest of her sons, and in his death\nshe magnifies his name. But her wisdom is very rare.\n\nNow, the trouble of Patrasche was this. Into these great, sad piles of\nstones, that reared their melancholy majesty above the crowded roofs,\nthe child Nello would many and many a time enter, and disappear through\ntheir dark arched portals, whilst Patrasche, left without upon the\npavement, would wearily and vainly ponder on what could be the charm\nwhich thus allured from him his inseparable and beloved companion. Once\nor twice he did essay to see for himself, clattering up the steps with\nhis milk-cart behind him; but thereon he had been always sent back again\nsummarily by a tall custodian in black clothes and silver chains of\noffice; and fearful of bringing his little master into trouble, he\ndesisted, and remained couched patiently before the churches until such\ntime as the boy reappeared. It was not the fact of his going into them\nwhich disturbed Patrasche: he knew that people went to church: all\nthe village went to the small, tumbledown, gray pile opposite the red\nwindmill.\n\nWhat troubled him was that little Nello always looked strangely when\nhe came out, always very flushed or very pale; and whenever he returned\nhome after such visitations would sit silent and dreaming, not caring to\nplay, but gazing out at the evening skies beyond the line of the canal,\nvery subdued and almost sad.\n\nWhat was it? wondered Patrasche. He thought it could not be good or\nnatural for the little lad to be so grave, and in his dumb fashion he\ntried all he could to keep Nello by him in the sunny fields or in the\nbusy market-place. But to the churches Nello would go: most often of all\nwould he go to the great cathedral; and Patrasche, left without on the\nstones by the iron fragments of Quentin Matsys's gate, would stretch\nhimself and yawn and sigh, and even howl now and then, all in vain,\nuntil the doors closed and the child perforce came forth again, and\nwinding his arms about the dog's neck would kiss him on his broad,\ntawney-colored forehead, and murmur always the same words: \"If I could\nonly see them, Patrasche!--if I could only see them!\"\n\nWhat were they? pondered Patrasche, looking up with large, wistful,\nsympathetic eyes.\n\nOne day, when the custodian was out of the way and the doors left ajar,\nhe got in for a moment after his little friend and saw. \"They\" were two\ngreat covered pictures on either side of the choir.\n\nNello was kneeling, rapt as in an ecstasy, before the altar-picture of\nthe Assumption, and when he noticed Patrasche, and rose and drew the dog\ngently out into the air, his face was wet with tears, and he looked up\nat the veiled places as he passed them, and murmured to his companion,\n\"It is so terrible not to see them, Patrasche, just because one is poor\nand cannot pay! He never meant that the poor should not see them when\nhe painted them, I am sure. He would have had us see them any day, every\nday: that I am sure. And they keep them shrouded there--shrouded in the\ndark, the beautiful things!--and they never feel the light, and no eyes\nlook on them, unless rich people come and pay. If I could only see them,\nI would be content to die.\"\n\nBut he could not see them, and Patrasche could not help him, for to gain\nthe silver piece that the church exacts as the price for looking on the\nglories of the Elevation of the Cross and the Descent of the Cross was\na thing as utterly beyond the powers of either of them as it would have\nbeen to scale the heights of the cathedral spire. They had never so much\nas a sou to spare: if they cleared enough to get a little wood for the\nstove, a little broth for the pot, it was the utmost they could do.\nAnd yet the heart of the child was set in sore and endless longing upon\nbeholding the greatness of the two veiled Rubens.\n\n[Illustration: tree] [Illustration: scenery]\n\nThe whole soul of the little Ardennois thrilled and stirred with an\nabsorbing passion for Art. Going on his ways through the old city in\nthe early days before the sun or the people had risen, Nello, who looked\nonly a little peasant-boy, with a great dog drawing milk to sell from\ndoor to door, was in a heaven of dreams whereof Rubens was the god.\nNello, cold and hungry, with stockingless feet in wooden shoes, and the\nwinter winds blowing among his curls and lifting his poor thin garments,\nwas in a rapture of meditation, wherein all that he saw was the\nbeautiful fair face of the Mary of the Assumption, with the waves of her\ngolden hair lying upon her shoulders, and the light of an eternal sun\nshining down upon her brow. Nello, reared in poverty, and buffeted\nby fortune, and untaught in letters, and unheeded by men, had the\ncompensation or the curse which is called Genius.\n\nNo one knew it. He as little as any. No one knew it. Only indeed\nPatrasche, who, being with him always, saw him draw with chalk upon\nthe stones any and every thing that grew or breathed, heard him on his\nlittle bed of hay murmur all manner of timid, pathetic prayers to the\nspirit of the great Master; watched his gaze darken and his face radiate\nat the evening glow of sunset or the rosy rising of the dawn; and felt\nmany and many a time the tears of a strange, nameless pain and joy,\nmingled together, fall hotly from the bright young eyes upon his own\nwrinkled yellow forehead.\n\n\"I should go to my grave quite content if I thought, Nello, that when\nthou growest a man thou couldst own this hut and the little plot of\nground, and labor for thyself, and be called Baas by thy neighbors,\"\nsaid the old man Jehan many an hour from his bed. For to own a bit of\nsoil, and to be called Baas--master--by the hamlet round, is to have\nachieved the highest ideal of a Flemish peasant; and the old soldier,\nwho had wandered over all the earth in his youth, and had brought\nnothing back, deemed in his old age that to live and die on one spot in\ncontented humility was the fairest fate he could desire for his darling.\nBut Nello said nothing.\n\nThe same leaven was working in him that in other times begat Rubens and\nJordaens and the Van Eycks, and all their wondrous tribe, and in times\nmore recent begat in the green country of the Ardennes, where the Meuse\nwashes the old walls of Dijon, the great artist of the Patroclus, whose\ngenius is too near us for us aright to measure its divinity.\n\nNello dreamed of other things in the future than of tilling the little\nrood of earth, and living under the wattle roof, and being called Baas\nby neighbors a little poorer or a little less poor than himself. The\ncathedral spire, where it rose beyond the fields in the ruddy evening\nskies or in the dim, gray, misty mornings, said other things to him than\nthis. But these he told only to Patrasche, whispering, childlike, his\nfancies in the dog's ear when they went together at their work through\nthe fogs of the daybreak, or lay together at their rest among the\nrustling rushes by the water's side.\n\nFor such dreams are not easily shaped into speech to awake the slow\nsympathies of human auditors; and they would only have sorely perplexed\nand troubled the poor old man bedridden in his corner, who, for his\npart, whenever he had trodden the streets of Antwerp, had thought the\ndaub of blue and red that they called a Madonna, on the walls of the\nwine-shop where he drank his sou's worth of black beer, quite as good as\nany of the famous altar-pieces for which the stranger folk travelled far\nand wide into Flanders from every land on which the good sun shone.\n\nThere was only one other beside Patrasche to whom Nello could talk at\nall of his daring fantasies. This other was little Alois, who lived at\nthe old red mill on the grassy mound, and whose father, the miller, was\nthe best-to-do husbandman in all the village. Little Alois was only a\npretty baby with soft round, rosy features, made lovely by those sweet\ndark eyes that the Spanish rule has left in so many a Flemish face,\nin testimony of the Alvan dominion, as Spanish art has left broadsown\nthroughout the country majestic palaces and stately courts, gilded\nhouse-fronts and sculptured lintels--histories in blazonry and poems in\nstone.\n\nLittle Alois was often with Nello and Patrasche. They played in the\nfields, they ran in the snow, they gathered the daisies and bilberries,\nthey went up to the old gray church together, and they often sat\ntogether by the broad wood-fire in the mill-house. Little Alois, indeed,\nwas the richest child in the hamlet. She had neither brother nor sister;\nher blue serge dress had never a hole in it; at Kermesse she had as many\ngilded nuts and Agni Dei in sugar as her hands could hold; and when she\nwent up for her first communion her flaxen curls were covered with a\ncap of richest Mechlin lace, which had been her mother's and her\ngrandmother's before it came to her. Men spoke already, though she had\nbut twelve years, of the good wife she would be for their sons to woo\nand win; but she herself was a little gay, simple child, in nowise\nconscious of her heritage, and she loved no playfellows so well as Jehan\nDaas's grandson and his dog.\n\n[Illustration: child] [Illustration: NELLO DREW THEIR LIKENESS WITH A\nSTICK OF CHARCOAL] [Illustration: couple walking]\n\nOne day her father, Baas Cogez, a good man, but somewhat stern, came on\na pretty group in the long meadow behind the mill, where the aftermath\nhad that day been cut. It was his little daughter sitting amidst the\nhay, with the great tawny head of Patrasche on her lap, and many wreaths\nof poppies and blue corn-flowers round them both: on a clean smooth slab\nof pine wood the boy Nello drew their likeness with a stick of charcoal.\n\nThe miller stood and looked at the portrait with tears in his eyes, it\nwas so strangely like, and he loved his only child closely and well.\nThen he roughly chid the little girl for idling there whilst her\nmother needed her within, and sent her indoors crying and afraid: then,\nturning, he snatched the wood from Nello's hands. \"Dost do much of such\nfolly?\" he asked, but there was a tremble in his voice.\n\nNello colored and hung his head. \"I draw everything I see,\" he murmured.\n\nThe miller was silent: then he stretched his hand out with a franc in\nit. \"It is folly, as I say, and evil waste of time: nevertheless, it is\nlike Alois, and will please the house-mother. Take this silver bit for\nit and leave it for me.\"\n\nThe color died out of the face of the young Ardennois; he lifted\nhis head and put his hands behind his back. \"Keep your money and the\nportrait both, Baas Cogez,\" he said, simply. \"You have been often good\nto me.\" Then he called Patrasche to him, and walked away across the\nfield.\n\n\"I could have seen them with that franc,\" he murmured to Patrasche, \"but\nI could not sell her picture--not even for them.\"\n\nBaas Cogez went into his mill-house sore troubled in his mind. \"That\nlad must not be so much with Alois,\" he said to his wife that night.\n\"Trouble may come of it hereafter: he is fifteen now, and she is twelve;\nand the boy is comely of face and form.\"\n\n\"And he is a good lad and a loyal,\" said the housewife, feasting her\neyes on the piece of pine wood where it was throned above the chimney\nwith a cuckoo clock in oak and a Calvary in wax.\n\n\"Yea, I do not gainsay that,\" said the miller, draining his pewter\nflagon.\n\n\"Then, if what you think of were ever to come to pass,\" said the wife,\nhesitatingly, \"would it matter so much? She will have enough for both,\nand one cannot be better than happy.\"\n\n\"You are a woman, and therefore a fool,\" said the miller, harshly,\nstriking his pipe on the table. \"The lad is naught but a beggar, and,\nwith these painter's fancies, worse than a beggar. Have a care that they\nare not together in the future, or I will send the child to the surer\nkeeping of the nuns of the Sacred Heart.\"\n\nThe poor mother was terrified, and promised humbly to do his will. Not\nthat she could bring herself altogether to separate the child from\nher favorite playmate, nor did the miller even desire that extreme of\ncruelty to a young lad who was guilty of nothing except poverty. But\nthere were many ways in which little Alois was kept away from her chosen\ncompanion; and Nello, being a boy proud and quiet and sensitive,\nwas quickly wounded, and ceased to turn his own steps and those of\nPatrasche, as he had been used to do with every moment of leisure, to\nthe old red mill upon the slope. What his offence was he did not know:\nhe supposed he had in some manner angered Baas Cogez by taking the\nportrait of Alois in the meadow; and when the child who loved him would\nrun to him and nestle her hand in his, he would smile at her very sadly\nand say with a tender concern for her before himself, \"Nay, Alois, do\nnot anger your father. He thinks that I make you idle, dear, and he is\nnot pleased that you should be with me. He is a good man and loves you\nwell: we will not anger him, Alois.\"\n\nBut it was with a sad heart that he said it, and the earth did not look\nso bright to him as it had used to do when he went out at sunrise under\nthe poplars down the straight roads with Patrasche. The old red mill had\nbeen a landmark to him, and he had been used to pause by it, going and\ncoming, for a cheery greeting with its people as her little flaxen head\nrose above the low mill-wicket, and her little rosy hands had held out\na bone or a crust to Patrasche. Now the dog looked wistfully at a closed\ndoor, and the boy went on without pausing, with a pang at his heart, and\nthe child sat within with tears dropping slowly on the knitting to which\nshe was set on her little stool by the stove; and Baas Cogez, working\namong his sacks and his mill-gear, would harden his will and say to\nhimself, \"It is best so. The lad is all but a beggar, and full of idle,\ndreaming fooleries. Who knows what mischief might not come of it in the\nfuture?\" So he was wise in his generation, and would not have the door\nunbarred, except upon rare and formal occasion, which seemed to have\nneither warmth nor mirth in them to the two children, who had been\naccustomed so long to a daily gleeful, careless, happy interchange of\ngreeting, speech, and pastime, with no other watcher of their sports or\nauditor of their fancies than Patrasche, sagely shaking the brazen bells\nof his collar and responding with all a dog's swift sympathies to their\nevery change of mood.\n\nAll this while the little panel of pine wood remained over the chimney\nin the mill-kitchen with the cuckoo clock and the waxen Calvary, and\nsometimes it seemed to Nello a little hard that whilst his gift was\naccepted he himself should be denied.\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nBut he did not complain: it was his habit to be quiet: old Jehan Daas\nhad said ever to him, \"We are poor: we must take what God sends--the ill\nwith the good: the poor cannot choose.\"\n\nTo which the boy had always listened in silence, being reverent of his\nold grandfather; but nevertheless a certain vague, sweet hope, such as\nbeguiles the children of genius, had whispered in his heart, \"Yet the\npoor do choose sometimes--choose to be great, so that men cannot say\nthem nay.\" And he thought so still in his innocence; and one day, when\nthe little Alois, finding him by chance alone among the cornfields by\nthe canal, ran to him and held him close, and sobbed piteously because\nthe morrow would be her saint's day, and for the first time in all her\nlife her parents had failed to bid him to the little supper and romp in\nthe great barns with which her feast-day was always celebrated, Nello\nhad kissed her and murmured to her in firm faith, \"It shall be different\none day, Alois. One day that little bit of pine wood that your father\nhas of mine shall be worth its weight in silver; and he will not shut\nthe door against me then. Only love me always, dear little Alois, only\nlove me always, and I will be great.\"\n\n\"And if I do not love you?\" the pretty child asked, pouting a little\nthrough her tears, and moved by the instinctive coquetries of her sex.\n\nNello's eyes left her face and wandered to the distance, where in the\nred and gold of the Flemish night the cathedral spire rose. There was a\nsmile on his face so sweet and yet so sad that little Alois was awed by\nit. \"I will be great still,\" he said under his breath--\"great still, or\ndie, Alois.\"\n\n\"You do not love me,\" said the little spoilt child, pushing him away;\nbut the boy shook his head and smiled, and went on his way through the\ntall yellow corn, seeing as in a vision some day in a fair future when\nhe should come into that old familiar land and ask Alois of her people,\nand be not refused or denied, but received in honor, whilst the village\nfolk should throng to look upon him and say in one another's ears, \"Dost\nsee him? He is a king among men, for he is a great artist and the world\nspeaks his name; and yet he was only our poor little Nello, who was a\nbeggar as one may say, and only got his bread by the help of his dog.\"\nAnd he thought how he would fold his grandsire in furs and purples, and\nportray him as the old man is portrayed in the Family in the chapel of\nSt. Jacques; and of how he would hang the throat of Patrasche with a\ncollar of gold, and place him on his right hand, and say to the people,\n\"This was once my only friend;\" and of how he would build himself a\ngreat white marble palace, and make to himself luxuriant gardens of\npleasure, on the slope looking outward to where the cathedral spire\nrose, and not dwell in it himself, but summon to it, as to a home, all\nmen young and poor and friendless, but of the will to do mighty things;\nand of how he would say to them always, if they sought to bless his\nname, \"Nay, do not thank me--thank Rubens. Without him, what should I\nhave been?\" And these dreams, beautiful, impossible, innocent, free of\nall selfishness, full of heroical worship, were so closely about him as\nhe went that he was happy--happy even on this sad anniversary of Alois's\nsaint's day, when he and Patrasche went home by themselves to the little\ndark hut and the meal of black bread, whilst in the mill-house all the\nchildren of the village sang and laughed, and ate the big round cakes\nof Dijon and the almond gingerbread of Brabant, and danced in the great\nbarn to the light of the stars and the music of flute and fiddle.\n\n\"Never mind, Patrasche,\" he said, with his arms round the dog's neck as\nthey both sat in the door of the hut, where the sounds of the mirth at\nthe mill came down to them on the night air--\"never mind. It shall all\nbe changed by and by.\"\n\nHe believed in the future: Patrasche, of more experience and of more\nphilosophy, thought that the loss of the mill supper in the present was\nill compensated by dreams of milk and honey in some vague hereafter. And\nPatrasche growled whenever he passed by Baas Cogez.\n\n\"This is Alois's name-day, is it not?\" said the old man Daas that night\nfrom the corner where he was stretched upon his bed of sacking.\n\nThe boy gave a gesture of assent: he wished that the old man's memory\nhad erred a little, instead of keeping such sure account.\n\n\"And why not there?\" his grandfather pursued. \"Thou hast never missed a\nyear before, Nello.\"\n\n\"Thou art too sick to leave,\" murmured the lad, bending his handsome\nhead over the bed.\n\n\"Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would have come and sat with me, as she does\nscores of times. What is the cause, Nello?\" the old man persisted. \"Thou\nsurely hast not had ill words with the little one?\"\n\n\"Nay, grandfather--never,\" said the boy quickly, with a hot color in\nhis bent face. \"Simply and truly, Baas Cogez did not have me asked this\nyear. He has taken some whim against me.\"\n\n\"But thou hast done nothing wrong?\"\n\n\"That I know--nothing. I took the portrait of Alois on a piece of pine:\nthat is all.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" The old man was silent: the truth suggested itself to him with\nthe boy's innocent answer. He was tied to a bed of dried leaves in the\ncorner of a wattle hut, but he had not wholly forgotten what the ways of\nthe world were like.\n\nHe drew Nello's fair head fondly to his breast with a tenderer gesture.\n\"Thou art very poor, my child,\" he said with a quiver the more in his\naged, trembling voice--\"so poor! It is very hard for thee.\"\n\n\"Nay, I am rich,\" murmured Nello; and in his innocence he thought\nso--rich with the imperishable powers that are mightier than the might\nof kings. And he went and stood by the door of the hut in the quiet\nautumn night, and watched the stars troop by and the tall poplars\nbend and shiver in the wind. All the casements of the mill-house were\nlighted, and every now and then the notes of the flute came to him. The\ntears fell down his cheeks, for he was but a child, yet he smiled, for\nhe said to himself, \"In the future!\" He stayed there until all was quite\nstill and dark, then he and Patrasche went within and slept together,\nlong and deeply, side by side.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNow he had a secret which only Patrasche knew. There was a little\nout-house to the hut, which no one entered but himself--a dreary place,\nbut with abundant clear light from the north. Here he had fashioned\nhimself rudely an easel in rough lumber, and here on a great gray sea\nof stretched paper he had given shape to one of the innumerable fancies\nwhich possessed his brain. No one had ever taught him anything; colors\nhe had no means to buy; he had gone without bread many a time to procure\neven the few rude vehicles that he had here; and it was only in black or\nwhite that he could fashion the things he saw. This great figure which\nhe had drawn here in chalk was only an old man sitting on a fallen\ntree--only that.\n\nHe had seen old Michel the woodman sitting so at evening many a time. He\nhad never had a soul to tell him of outline or perspective, of anatomy\nor of shadow, and yet he had given all the weary, worn-out age, all the\nsad, quiet patience, all the rugged, careworn pathos of his original,\nand given them so that the old lonely figure was a poem, sitting\nthere, meditative and alone, on the dead tree, with the darkness of the\ndescending night behind him.\n\nIt was rude, of course, in a way, and had many faults, no doubt; and yet\nit was real, true in nature, true in art, and very mournful, and in a\nmanner beautiful.\n\nPatrasche had lain quiet countless hours watching its gradual creation\nafter the labor of each day was done, and he knew that Nello had a\nhope--vain and wild perhaps, but strongly cherished--of sending this\ngreat drawing to compete for a prize of two hundred francs a year\nwhich it was announced in Antwerp would be open to every lad of talent,\nscholar or peasant, under eighteen, who would attempt to win it with\nsome unaided work of chalk or pencil. Three of the foremost artists in\nthe town of Rubens were to be the judges and elect the victor according\nto his merits.\n\nAll the spring and summer and autumn Nello had been at work upon this\ntreasure, which, if triumphant, would build him his first step toward\nindependence and the mysteries of the art which he blindly, ignorantly,\nand yet passionately adored.\n\nHe said nothing to any one: his grandfather would not have understood,\nand little Alois was lost to him. Only to Patrasche he told all, and\nwhispered, \"Rubens would give it me, I think, if he knew.\"\n\nPatrasche thought so too, for he knew that Rubens had loved dogs or he\nhad never painted them with such exquisite fidelity; and men who loved\ndogs were, as Patrasche knew, always pitiful.\n\nThe drawings were to go in on the first day of December, and the\ndecision be given on the twenty-fourth, so that he who should win might\nrejoice with all his people at the Christmas season.\n\nIn the twilight of a bitter wintry day, and with a beating heart, now\nquick with hope, now faint with fear, Nello placed the great picture\non his little green milk-cart, and took it, with the help of Patrasche,\ninto the town, and there left it, as enjoined, at the doors of a public\nbuilding.\n\n\"Perhaps it is worth nothing at all. How can I tell?\" he thought, with\nthe heart-sickness of a great timidity. Now that he had left it there,\nit seemed to him so hazardous, so vain, so foolish, to dream that he,\na little lad with bare feet, who barely knew his letters, could do\nanything at which great painters, real artists, could ever deign to\nlook. Yet he took heart as he went by the cathedral: the lordly form of\nRubens seemed to rise from the fog and the darkness, and to loom in\nits magnificence before him, whilst the lips, with their kindly smile,\nseemed to him to murmur, \"Nay, have courage! It was not by a weak heart\nand by faint fears that I wrote my name for all time upon Antwerp.\"\n\nNello ran home through the cold night, comforted. He had done his\nbest: the rest must be as God willed, he thought, in that innocent,\nunquestioning faith which had been taught him in the little gray chapel\namong the willows and the poplar-trees.\n\n[Illustration: ]\n\nThe winter was very sharp already. That night, after they reached the\nhut, snow fell; and fell for very many days after that, so that the\npaths and the divisions in the fields were all obliterated, and all\nthe smaller streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense upon the\nplains. Then, indeed, it became hard work to go round for the milk while\nthe world was all dark, and carry it through the darkness to the silent\ntown. Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage of the years,\nthat were only bringing Nello a stronger youth, were bringing him old\nage, and his joints were stiff and his bones ached often. But he would\nnever give up his share of the labor. Nello would fain have spared him\nand drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche would not allow it. All he\nwould ever permit or accept was the help of a thrust from behind to the\ntruck as it lumbered along through the ice-ruts. Patrasche had lived in\nharness, and he was proud of it. He suffered a great deal sometimes from\nfrost, and the terrible roads, and the rheumatic pains of his limbs, but\nhe only drew his breath hard and bent his stout neck, and trod onward\nwith steady patience.\n\n\"Rest thee at home, Patrasche--it is time thou didst rest--and I can\nquite well push in the cart by myself,\" urged Nello many a morning; but\nPatrasche, who understood him aright, would no more have consented\nto stay at home than a veteran soldier to shirk when the charge was\nsounding; and every day he would rise and place himself in his shafts,\nand plod along over the snow through the fields that his four round feet\nhad left their print upon so many, many years.\n\n\"One must never rest till one dies,\" thought Patrasche; and sometimes it\nseemed to him that that time of rest for him was not very far off. His\nsight was less clear than it had been, and it gave him pain to rise\nafter the night's sleep, though he would never lie a moment in his straw\nwhen once the bell of the chapel tolling five let him know that the\ndaybreak of labor had begun.\n\n\"My poor Patrasche, we shall soon lie quiet together, you and I,\" said\nold Jehan Daas, stretching out to stroke the head of Patrasche with the\nold withered hand which had always shared with him its one poor crust of\nbread; and the hearts of the old man and the old dog ached together with\none thought: When they were gone, who would care for their darling?\n\nOne afternoon, as they came back from Antwerp over the snow, which had\nbecome hard and smooth as marble over all the Flemish plains, they found\ndropped in the road a pretty little puppet, a tambourine--player, all\nscarlet and gold, about six inches high, and, unlike greater personages\nwhen Fortune lets them drop, quite unspoiled and unhurt by its fall. It\nwas a pretty toy. Nello tried to find its owner, and, failing, thought\nthat it was just the thing to please Alois.\n\nIt was quite night when he passed the mill-house: he knew the little\nwindow of her room. It could be no harm, he thought, if he gave her his\nlittle piece of treasure-trove, they had been playfellows so long. There\nwas a shed with a sloping roof beneath her casement: he climbed it and\ntapped softly at the lattice: there was a little light within. The\nchild opened it and looked out half frightened. Nello put the\ntambourine-player into her hands. \"Here is a doll I found in the snow,\nAlois. Take it,\" he whispered--\"take it, and God bless thee, dear!\"\n\nHe slid down from the shed-roof before she had time to thank him, and\nran off through the darkness.\n\nThat night there was a fire at the mill. Outbuildings and much corn\nwere destroyed, although the mill itself and the dwelling-house were\nunharmed. All the village was out in terror, and engines came tearing\nthrough the snow from Antwerp. The miller was insured, and would lose\nnothing: nevertheless, he was in furious wrath, and declared aloud that\nthe fire was due to no accident, but to some foul intent.\n\nNello, awakened from his sleep, ran to help with the rest: Baas Cogez\nthrust him angrily aside. \"Thou wert loitering here after dark,\" he said\nroughly. \"I believe, on my soul, that thou dost know more of the fire\nthan any one.\"\n\nNello heard him in silence, stupefied, not supposing that any one could\nsay such things except in jest, and not comprehending how any one could\npass a jest at such a time.\n\nNevertheless, the miller said the brutal thing openly to many of his\nneighbors in the day that followed; and though no serious charge was\never preferred against the lad, it got bruited about that Nello had been\nseen in the mill-yard after dark on some unspoken errand, and that he\nbore Baas Cogez a grudge for forbidding his intercourse with little\nAlois; and so the hamlet, which followed the sayings of its richest\nlandowner servilely, and whose families all hoped to secure the riches\nof Alois in some future time for their sons, took the hint to give grave\nlooks and cold words to old Jehan Daas's grandson. No one said anything\nto him openly, but all the village agreed together to humor the miller's\nprejudice, and at the cottages and farms where Nello and Patrasche\ncalled every morning for the milk for Antwerp, downcast glances and\nbrief phrases replaced to them the broad smiles and cheerful greetings\nto which they had been always used. No one really credited the miller's\nabsurd suspicion, nor the outrageous accusations born of them, but the\npeople were all very poor and very ignorant, and the one rich man of\nthe place had pronounced against him. Nello, in his innocence and his\nfriendlessness, had no strength to stem the popular tide.\n\n\"Thou art very cruel to the lad,\" the miller's wife dared to say,\nweeping, to her lord. \"Sure he is an innocent lad and a faithful, and\nwould never dream of any such wickedness, however sore his heart might\nbe.\"\n\nBut Baas Cogez being an obstinate man, having once said a thing held\nto it doggedly, though in his innermost soul he knew well the injustice\nthat he was committing.\n\nMeanwhile, Nello endured the injury done against him with a certain\nproud patience that disdained to complain: he only gave way a little\nwhen he was quite alone with old Patrasche. Besides, he thought, \"If it\nshould win! They will be sorry then, perhaps.\"\n\nStill, to a boy not quite sixteen, and who had dwelt in one little world\nall his short life, and in his childhood had been caressed and applauded\non all sides, it was a hard trial to have the whole of that little world\nturn against him for naught. Especially hard in that bleak, snow-bound,\nfamine-stricken winter-time, when the only light and warmth there could\nbe found abode beside the village hearths and in the kindly greetings of\nneighbors. In the winter-time all drew nearer to each other, all to all,\nexcept to Nello and Patrasche, with whom none now would have anything\nto do, and who were left to fare as they might with the old paralyzed,\nbedridden man in the little cabin, whose fire was often low, and whose\nboard was often without bread, for there was a buyer from Antwerp who\nhad taken to drive his mule in of a day for the milk of the various\ndairies, and there were only three or four of the people who had refused\nhis terms of purchase and remained faithful to the little green cart.\nSo that the burden which Patrasche drew had become very light, and the\ncentime-pieces in Nello's pouch had become, alas! very small likewise.\n\nThe dog would stop, as usual, at all the familiar gates, which were now\nclosed to him, and look up at them with wistful, mute appeal; and it\ncost the neighbors a pang to shut their doors and their hearts, and let\nPatrasche draw his cart on again, empty. Nevertheless, they did it, for\nthey desired to please Baas Cogez.\n\nNo\u00c3\u00abl was close at hand.\n\nThe weather was very wild and cold. The snow was six feet deep, and the\nice was firm enough to bear oxen and men upon it everywhere. At this\nseason the little village was always gay and cheerful. At the poorest\ndwelling there were possets and cakes, joking and dancing, sugared\nsaints and gilded J\u00c3\u00a9sus. The merry Flemish bells jingled everywhere on\nthe horses; everywhere within doors some well-filled soup-pot sang and\nsmoked over the stove; and everywhere over the snow without laughing\nmaidens pattered in bright kerchiefs and stout kirtles, going to and\nfrom the mass. Only in the little hut it was very dark and very cold.\n\nNello and Patrasche were left utterly alone, for one night in the week\nbefore the Christmas Day, Death entered there, and took away from life\nforever old Jehan Daas, who had never known life aught save its poverty\nand its pains. He had long been half dead, incapable of any movement\nexcept a feeble gesture, and powerless for anything beyond a gentle\nword; and yet his loss fell on them both with a great horror in it: they\nmourned him passionately. He had passed away from them in his sleep,\nand when in the gray dawn they learned their bereavement, unutterable\nsolitude and desolation seemed to close around them. He had long been\nonly a poor, feeble, paralyzed old man, who could not raise a hand in\ntheir defence, but he had loved them well: his smile had always\nwelcomed their return. They mourned for him unceasingly, refusing to be\ncomforted, as in the white winter day they followed the deal shell that\nheld his body to the nameless grave by the little gray church. They were\nhis only mourners, these two whom he had left friendless upon earth--the\nyoung boy and the old dog.\n\n\"Surely, he will relent now and let the poor lad come hither?\" thought\nthe miller's wife, glancing at her husband smoking by the hearth.\n\nBaas Cogez knew her thought, but he hardened his heart, and would not\nunbar his door as the little, humble funeral went by. \"The boy is a\nbeggar,\" he said to himself: \"he shall not be about Alois.\"\n\nThe woman dared not say anything aloud, but when the grave was closed\nand the mourners had gone, she put a wreath of immortelles into Alois's\nhands and bade her go and lay it reverently on the dark, unmarked mound\nwhere the snow was displaced.\n\nNello and Patrasche went home with broken hearts. But even of that poor,\nmelancholy, cheerless home they were denied the consolation. There was a\nmonth's rent over-due for their little home, and when Nello had paid the\nlast sad service to the dead he had not a coin left. He went and begged\ngrace of the owner of the hut, a cobbler who went every Sunday night\nto drink his pint of wine and smoke with Baas Cogez. The cobbler would\ngrant no mercy. He was a harsh, miserly man, and loved money. He claimed\nin default of his rent every stick and stone, every pot and pan, in the\nhut, and bade Nello and Patrasche be out of it on the morrow.\n\nNow, the cabin was lowly enough, and in some sense miserable enough, and\nyet their hearts clove to it with a great affection. They had been\nso happy there, and in the summer, with its clambering vine and its\nflowering beans, it was so pretty and bright in the midst of the\nsunlighted fields! There life in it had been full of labor and\nprivation, and yet they had been so well content, so gay of heart,\nrunning together to meet the old man's never-failing smile of welcome!\n\nAll night long the boy and the dog sat by the fireless hearth in the\ndarkness, drawn close together for warmth and sorrow. Their bodies were\ninsensible to the cold, but their hearts seemed frozen in them.\n\nWhen the morning broke over the white, chill earth it was the morning\nof Christmas Eve. With a shudder, Nello clasped close to him his only\nfriend, while his tears fell hot and fast on the dog's frank forehead.\n\"Let us go, Patrasche--dear, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured. \"We will not\nwait to be kicked out: let us go.\"\n\nPatrasche had no will but his, and they went sadly, side by side, out\nfrom the little place which was so dear to them both, and in which every\nhumble, homely thing was to them precious and beloved. Patrasche drooped\nhis head wearily as he passed by his own green cart: it was no longer\nhis--it had to go with the rest to pay the rent, and his brass harness\nlay idle and glittering on the snow. The dog could have lain down beside\nit and died for very heart-sickness as he went, but whilst the lad lived\nand needed him Patrasche would not yield and give way.\n\nThey took the old accustomed road into Antwerp. The day had yet scarce\nmore than dawned, most of the shutters were still closed, but some of\nthe villagers were about. They took no notice whilst the dog and the boy\npassed by them. At one door Nello paused and looked wistfully within:\nhis grandfather had done many a kindly turn in neighbor's service to the\npeople who dwelt there.\n\n\"Would you give Patrasche a crust?\" he said, timidly. \"He is old, and he\nhas had nothing since last forenoon.\"\n\nThe woman shut the door hastily, murmuring some vague saying about wheat\nand rye being very dear that season. The boy and the dog went on again\nwearily: they asked no more.\n\nBy slow and painful ways they reached Antwerp as the chimes tolled ten.\n\n\"If I had anything about me I could sell to get him bread!\" thought\nNello, but he had nothing except the wisp of linen and serge that\ncovered him, and his pair of wooden shoes. Patrasche understood, and\nnestled his nose into the lad's hand, as though to pray him not to be\ndisquieted for any woe or want of his.\n\nThe winner of the drawing-prize was to be proclaimed at noon, and to the\npublic building where he had left his treasure Nello made his way. On\nthe steps and in the entrance-hall there was a crowd of youths--some of\nhis age, some older, all with parents or relatives or friends. His heart\nwas sick with fear as he went among them, holding Patrasche close to\nhim. The great bells of the city clashed out the hour of noon with\nbrazen clamor. The doors of the inner hall were opened; the eager,\npanting throng rushed in: it was known that the selected picture would\nbe raised above the rest upon a wooden dais..\n\nA mist obscured Nello's sight, his head swam, his limbs almost failed\nhim. When his vision cleared he saw the drawing raised on high: it was\nnot his own! A slow, sonorous voice was proclaiming aloud that victory\nhad been adjudged to Stephen Kiesslinger, born in the burgh of Antwerp,\nson of a wharfinger in that town.\n\nWhen Nello recovered his consciousness he was lying on the stones\nwithout, and Patrasche was trying with every art he knew to call him\nback to life. In the distance a throng of the youths of Antwerp were\nshouting around their successful comrade, and escorting him with\nacclamations to his home upon the quay.\n\nThe boy staggered to his feet and drew the dog into his embrace. \"It is\nall over, dear Patrasche,\" he murmured--\"all over!\"\n\nHe rallied himself as best he could, for he was weak from fasting, and\nretraced his steps to the village. Patrasche paced by his side with his\nhead drooping and his old limbs feeble from hunger and sorrow.\n\nThe snow was falling fast: a keen hurricane blew from the north: it\nwas bitter as death on the plains. It took them long to traverse the\nfamiliar path, and the bells were sounding four of the clock as they\napproached the hamlet. Suddenly Patrasche paused, arrested by a scent in\nthe snow, scratched, whined, and drew out with his teeth a small case of\nbrown leather. He held it up to Nello in the darkness. Where they were\nthere stood a little Calvary, and a lamp burned dully under the cross:\nthe boy mechanically turned the case to the light: on it was the name of\nBaas Cogez, and within it were notes for two thousand francs.\n\nThe sight roused the lad a little from his stupor. He thrust it in his\nshirt, and stroked Patrasche and drew him onward. The dog looked up\nwistfully in his face.\n\nNello made straight for the mill-house, and went to the house-door and\nstruck on its panels. The miller's wife opened it weeping, with little\nAlois clinging close to her skirts. \"Is it thee, thou poor lad?\" she\nsaid kindly through her tears. \"Get thee gone ere the Baas see thee.\nWe are in sore trouble to-night. He is out seeking for a power of money\nthat he has let fall riding homeward, and in this snow he never will\nfind it; and God knows it will go nigh to ruin us. It is Heaven's own\njudgment for the things we have done to thee.\"\n\nNello put the note-case in her hand and called Patrasche within the\nhouse. \"Patrasche found the money to-night,\" he said quickly. \"Tell Baas\nCogez so: I think he will not deny the dog shelter and food in his old\nage. Keep him from pursuing me, and I pray of you to be good to him.\"\n\nEre either woman or dog knew what he meant he had stooped and kissed\nPatrasche: then closed the door hurriedly, and disappeared in the gloom\nof the fast--falling night.\n\nThe woman and the child stood speechless with joy and fear: Patrasche\nvainly spent the fury of his anguish against the iron-bound oak of the\nbarred house-door. They did not dare unbar the door and let him forth:\nthey tried all they could to solace him. They brought him sweet cakes\nand juicy meats; they tempted him with the best they had; they tried to\nlure him to abide by the warmth of the hearth; but it was of no avail.\nPatrasche refused to be comforted or to stir from the barred portal.\n\nIt was six o'clock when from an opposite entrance the miller at last\ncame, jaded and broken, into his wife's presence. \"It is lost forever,\"\nhe said, with an ashen cheek and a quiver in his stern voice. \"We have\nlooked with lanterns everywhere: it is gone--the little maiden's portion\nand all!\"\n\nHis wife put the money into his hand, and told him how it had come to\nher. The strong man sank trembling into a seat and covered his face,\nashamed and almost afraid. \"I have been cruel to the lad,\" he muttered\nat length: \"I deserved not to have good at his hands.\"\n\nLittle Alois, taking courage, crept close to her father and nestled\nagainst him her fair curly head. \"Nello may come here again, father?\"\nshe whispered. \"He may come to-morrow as he used to do?\"\n\nThe miller pressed her in his arms: his hard, sunburned face was very\npale and his mouth trembled. \"Surely, surely,\" he answered his child.\n\"He shall bide here on Christmas Day, and any other day he will. God\nhelping me, I will make amends to the boy--I will make amends.\"\n\nLittle Alois kissed him in gratitude and joy, then slid from his knees\nand ran to where the dog kept watch by the door. \"And to-night I may\nfeast Patrasche?\" she cried in a child's thoughtless glee.\n\nHer father bent his head gravely: \"Ay, ay: let the dog have the best;\"\nfor the stern old man was moved and shaken to his heart's depths.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the mill-house was filled with oak logs and\nsquares of turf, with cream and honey, with meat and bread, and the\nrafters were hung with wreaths of evergreen, and the Calvary and the\ncuckoo clock looked out from a mass of holly. There were little paper\nlanterns, too, for Alois, and toys of various fashions and sweetmeats\nin bright-pictured papers. There were light and warmth and abundance\neverywhere, and the child would fain have made the dog a guest honored\nand feasted.\n\nBut Patrasche would neither lie in the warmth nor share in the cheer.\nFamished he was and very cold, but without Nello he would partake\nneither of comfort nor food. Against all temptation he was proof, and\nclose against the door he leaned always, watching only for a means of\nescape.\n\n\"He wants the lad,\" said Baas Cogez. \"Good dog! good dog! I will go over\nto the lad the first thing at day-dawn.\" For no one but Patrasche knew\nthat Nello had left the hut, and no one but Patrasche divined that Nello\nhad gone to face starvation and misery alone.\n\nThe mill-kitchen was very warm: great logs crackled and flamed on the\nhearth; neighbors came in for a glass of wine and a slice of the fat\ngoose baking for supper. Alois, gleeful and sure of her playmate back\non the morrow, bounded and sang and tossed back her yellow hair. Baas\nCogez, in the fulness of his heart, smiled on her through moistened\neyes, and spoke of the way in which he would befriend her favorite\ncompanion; the house-mother sat with calm, contented face at the\nspinning-wheel; the cuckoo in the clock chirped mirthful hours. Amidst\nit all Patrasche was bidden with a thousand words of welcome to tarry\nthere a cherished guest. But neither peace nor plenty could allure him\nwhere Nello was not.\n\nWhen the supper smoked on the board, and the voices were loudest\nand gladdest, and the Christ-child brought choicest gifts to Alois,\nPatrasche, watching always an occasion, glided out when the door was\nunlatched by a careless new-comer, and as swiftly as his weak and tired\nlimbs would bear him sped over the snow in the bitter, black night. He\nhad only one thought--to follow Nello. A human friend might have paused\nfor the pleasant meal, the cheery warmth, the cosey slumber; but that\nwas not the friendship of Patrasche. He remembered a bygone time, when\nan old man and a little child had found him sick unto death in the\nwayside ditch.\n\nSnow had fallen freshly all the evening long; it was now nearly ten; the\ntrail of the boy's footsteps was almost obliterated. It took Patrasche\nlong to discover any scent. When at last he found it, it was lost again\nquickly, and lost and recovered, and again lost and again recovered, a\nhundred times or more.\n\nThe night was very wild. The lamps under the wayside crosses were blown\nout; the roads were sheets of ice; the impenetrable darkness hid every\ntrace of habitations; there was no living thing abroad. All the cattle\nwere housed, and in all the huts and homesteads men and women rejoiced\nand feasted. There was only Patrasche out in the cruel cold--old and\nfamished and full of pain, but with the strength and the patience of a\ngreat love to sustain him in his search.\n\nThe trail of Nello's steps, faint and obscure as it was under the new\nsnow, went straightly along the accustomed tracks into Antwerp. It was\npast midnight when Patrasche traced it over the boundaries of the town\nand into the narrow, tortuous, gloomy streets. It was all quite dark in\nthe town, save where some light gleamed ruddily through the crevices\nof house-shutters, or some group went homeward with lanterns chanting\ndrinking-songs. The streets were all white with ice: the high walls and\nroofs loomed black against them. There was scarce a sound save the riot\nof the winds down the passages as they tossed the creaking signs and\nshook the tall lamp-irons.\n\n[Illustration: The portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the\nMidnight Mass]\n\nSo many passers-by had trodden through and through the snow, so many\ndiverse paths had crossed and recrossed each other, that the dog had a\nhard task to retain any hold on the track he followed. But he kept on\nhis way, though the cold pierced him to the bone, and the jagged ice cut\nhis feet, and the hunger in his body gnawed like a rat's teeth. He kept\non his way, a poor gaunt, shivering thing, and by long patience traced\nthe steps he loved into the very heart of the burgh and up to the steps\nof the great cathedral.\n\n\"He is gone to the things that he loved,\" thought Patrasche: he\ncould not understand, but he was full of sorrow and of pity for the\nart-passion that to him was so incomprehensible and yet so sacred.\n\nThe portals of the cathedral were unclosed after the midnight mass. Some\nheedlessness in the custodians, too eager to go home and feast or sleep,\nor too drowsy to know whether they turned the keys aright, had left one\nof the doors unlocked. By that accident the foot-falls Patrasche sought\nhad passed through into the building, leaving the white marks of snow\nupon the dark stone floor. By that slender white thread, frozen as it\nfell, he was guided through the intense silence, through the immensity\nof the vaulted space--guided straight to the gates of the chancel, and,\nstretched there upon the stones, he found Nello. He crept up and touched\nthe face of the boy. \"Didst thou dream that I should be faithless and\nforsake thee? I--a dog?\" said that mute caress.\n\nThe lad raised himself with a low cry and clasped him close. \"Let us lie\ndown and die together,\" he murmured. \"Men have no need of us, and we are\nall alone.\"\n\nIn answer, Patrasche crept closer yet, and laid his head upon the young\nboy's breast. The great tears stood in his brown, sad eyes: not for\nhimself--for himself he was happy.\n\nThey lay close together in the piercing cold. The blasts that blew over\nthe Flemish dikes from the northern seas were like waves of ice, which\nfroze every living thing they touched. The interior of the immense\nvault of stone in which they were was even more bitterly chill than\nthe snow-covered plains without. Now and then a bat moved in the\nshadows--now and then a gleam of light came on the ranks of carven\nfigures. Under the Rubens they lay together quite still, and soothed\nalmost into a dreaming slumber by the numbing narcotic of the cold.\nTogether they dreamed of the old glad days when they had chased each\nother through the flowering grasses of the summer meadows, or sat hidden\nin the tall bulrushes by the water's side, watching the boats go seaward\nin the sun.\n\nSuddenly through the darkness a great white radiance streamed through\nthe vastness of the aisles; the moon, that was at her height, had broken\nthrough the clouds, the snow had ceased to fall, the light reflected\nfrom the snow without was clear as the light of dawn. It fell through\nthe arches full upon the two pictures above, from which the boy on his\nentrance had flung back the veil: the Elevation and the Descent of the\nCross were for one instant visible.\n\nNello rose to his feet and stretched his arms to them; the tears of a\npassionate ecstasy glistened on the paleness of his face. \"I have seen\nthem at last!\" he cried aloud. \"O God, it is enough!\"\n\nHis limbs failed under him, and he sank upon his knees, still gazing\nupward at the majesty that he adored. For a few brief moments the light\nillumined the divine visions that had been denied to him so long--light\nclear and sweet and strong as though it streamed from the throne of\nHeaven. Then suddenly it passed away: once more a great darkness covered\nthe face of Christ.\n\nThe arms of the boy drew close again the body of the dog. \"We shall see\nHis face--_there,_\" he murmured; \"and He will not part us, I think.\" On\nthe morrow, by the chancel of the cathedral, the people of Antwerp found\nthem both. They were both dead: the cold of the night had frozen into\nstillness alike the young life and the old. When the Christmas morning\nbroke and the priests came to the temple, they saw them lying thus on\nthe stones together. Above the veils were drawn back from the great\nvisions of Rubens, and the fresh rays of the sunrise touched the\nthorn-crowned head of the Christ.\n\nAs the day grew on there came an old, hard-featured man who wept as\nwomen weep. \"I was cruel to the lad,\" he muttered, \"and now I would have\nmade amends--yea, to the half of my substance--and he should have been\nto me as a son.\"\n\nThere came also, as the day grew apace, a painter who had fame in the\nworld, and who was liberal of hand and of spirit. \"I seek one who should\nhave had the prize yesterday had worth won,\" he said to the people--\"a\nboy of rare promise and genius. An old wood-cutter on a fallen tree at\neventide--that was all his theme. But there was greatness for the future\nin it. I would fain find him, and take him with me and teach him Art.\"\n\nAnd a little child with curling fair hair, sobbing bitterly as she clung\nto her father's arm, cried aloud, \"Oh, Nello, come! We have all ready\nfor thee. The Christ-child's hands are full of gifts, and the old piper\nwill play for us; and the mother says thou shalt stay by the hearth and\nburn nuts with us all the No\u00c3\u00abl week long--yes, even to the Feast of the\nKings! And Patrasche will be so happy! Oh, Nello, wake and come!\"\n\nBut the young pale face, turned upward to the light of the great Rubens\nwith a smile upon its mouth, answered them all, \"It is too late.\"\n\nFor the sweet, sonorous bells went ringing through the frost, and the\nsunlight shone upon the plains of snow, and the populace trooped gay and\nglad through the streets, but Nello and Patrasche no more asked charity\nat their hands. All they needed now Antwerp gave unbidden.\n\nDeath had been more pitiful to them than longer life would have been. It\nhad taken the one in the loyalty of love, and the other in the innocence\nof faith, from a world which for love has no recompense and for faith no\nfulfilment.\n\nAll their lives they had been together, and in their deaths they were\nnot divided: for when they were found the arms of the boy were folded\ntoo closely around the dog to be severed without violence, and the\npeople of their little village, contrite and ashamed, implored a special\ngrace for them, and, making them one grave, laid them to rest there side\nby side--forever!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Dog of Flanders, by Louisa de la Ram\u00c3\u00aa, AKA \u00c3\u0093uida\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DOG OF FLANDERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7766-8.txt or 7766-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/7\/6\/7766\/\n\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, S.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":820,"split":"train"}
