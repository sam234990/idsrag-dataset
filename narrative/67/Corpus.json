{"ori_id":"0f849890e27fd05b9a8683d111f489515db72ea4","title":"The Bacchae","context":"The Bacchae\n The play begins in front of the palace of Thebes, with Dionysus telling the story of his origin and his reasons for visiting the city. Dionysus explains that he was born prematurely, when Hera made Zeus send down a lightning bolt, killing the pregnant Semele and causing the birth. Some in Thebes, he notes, don\u2019t believe this story. In fact, Semele\u2019s sisters \u2014 Autonoe, Agave, and Ino \u2013 claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that Semele became pregnant by some mortal; they say Zeus' lightning was a punishment for the lie. Dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad, including his three aunts, and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities. He explains that while he is appearing, at the moment, disguised as a mortal, he will vindicate his mother by appearing before all of Thebes as a god, the son of Zeus, and establishing his permanent cult of followers.\nDionysus exits to go into the mountains, and the chorus enters. They dance and sing, celebrating Dionysus and adding details of his birth and the Dionysian rites. Then Tiresias, the blind and elderly seer, appears. He knocks on the palace doors and calls for Cadmus, the founder and former king of Thebes. The two venerable old men are planning to join the revelry in the mountains when Cadmus\u2019 grandson Pentheus, the current king, enters. Disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship. He wants the \"foreigner\", whom he doesn't recognize as Dionysus in disguise, to be captured. Pentheus intends to have him stoned to death.\nThe guards soon return with Dionysus himself. His hands are bound, and he is disguised as a priest and the leader of the Asian Maenads. Pentheus questions him, his words showing both his skepticism and his interest in the Dionysian rites. Dionysus' answers keep the meaning hidden, only hinting at the truth Pentheus cannot see. Infuriated, Pentheus has him taken away in chains and locked up in his stable, where the guards attach the other end of their prisoner's chains to the hooves of an angry bull. Dionysus, being a god and powerful, breaks free and creates more havoc, razing the palace with an earthquake and fire. Dionysus is confronting Pentheus, when a herdsman arrives from the top of Mount Cithaeron, where he had been herding his grazing cattle. He reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely. First, some were sleeping quietly, or drinking wine while listening to flute music. Some were going into the woods \"in pursuit of love\". Some women were putting snakes in their hair, some were suckling wild wolves and gazelles. Some caused water, wine or milk to spring up from the ground. One woman had honey oozing from her thyrsus. The herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant, Pentheus' mother. But when they jumped out of hiding to grab her, the tables were turned, and the women pursued the men. The men escaped, but their cattle were not so fortunate, as the women fell upon the animals, ripping them to shreds with their bare hands. The women carried on, plundering two villages that were further down the mountain, stealing bronze, iron and even babies. When villagers attempted to fight back, the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel. They then returned to the mountain top and washed up, as snakes licked them clean.\nDionysus, still in disguise, persuades Pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force. He says it would first be better to spy on them, while disguised as a female Maenad to avoid detection. Dionysus dresses Pentheus as a woman, giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins, and leads him out of the house. At this point, Pentheus appears not wholly sane, as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky, and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands. He has also begun to see through Dionysus' mortal disguise, perceiving horns coming out of the god's head. They exit.\nA messenger arrives to report that once they reached Mount Cithaeron, Pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches. Then Dionysus, revealing himself, called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree. This drove the Maenads wild. Led by Agave, his mother, they forced the trapped Pentheus down from the tree top, ripped off his limbs, his head, and tore his body into pieces.\nAfter the messenger has relayed this news, Agave arrives, carrying her son's head. In her possessed state, she believes it is the head of a mountain lion. She proudly displays it to her father, Cadmus, and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy, and his face instead contorts in horror. Agave then calls out for Pentheus to come marvel at her feat, and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of Thebes. But Dionysus' possession begins to wear off, and Cadmus forces her to recognize what she's done. As the play ends, the corpse of Pentheus is reassembled, as well as is possible, the royal family is devastated and destroyed. Agave and her sisters are sent into exile, and Dionysus decrees that Cadmus and his wife Harmonia will be turned into snakes and lead a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of Hellas.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Bacchae of Euripides, by Euripedes\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

At one side is visible the sacred Tomb of Semel\u00c3\u00aa, a\n    little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the\n    rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke.\n    The God_ DIONYSUS _is discovered alone_.\n\n                  DIONYSUS.\n\nBehold, God's Son is come unto this land\nOf Thebes, even I, Dionysus, whom the brand\nOf heaven's hot splendour lit to life, when she\nWho bore me, Cadmus' daughter Semel\u00c3\u00aa,\nDied here. So, changed in shape from God to man,\nI walk again by Dirce's streams and scan\nIsmenus' shore. There by the castle side\nI see her place, the Tomb of the Lightning's Bride,\nThe wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great\nFaint wreaths of fire undying--as the hate\nDies not, that Hera held for Semel\u00c3\u00aa.\n  Aye, Cadmus hath done well; in purity\nHe keeps this place apart, inviolate,\nHis daughter's sanctuary; and I have set\nMy green and clustered vines to robe it round.\n  Far now behind me lies the golden ground\nOf Lydian and of Phrygian; far away\nThe wide hot plains where Persian sunbeams play,\nThe Bactrian war-holds, and the storm-oppressed\nClime of the Mede, and Araby the Blest,\nAnd Asia all, that by the salt sea lies\nIn proud embattled cities, motley-wise\nOf Hellene and Barbarian interwrought;\nAnd now I come to Hellas--having taught\nAll the world else my dances and my rite\nOf mysteries, to show me in men's sight\nManifest God.\n                And first of Hellene lands\nI cry thus Thebes to waken; set her hands\nTo clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,\nAnd round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.\nFor they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,\nSemel\u00c3\u00aa's sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed\nThat Dionysus sprang from Dian seed.\nMy mother sinned, said they; and in her need,\nWith Cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame\nWith the dread name of Zeus; for that the flame\nFrom heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to God.\n  Thus must they vaunt; and therefore hath my rod\nOn them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed\nFrom empty chambers; the bare mountain side\nIs made their home, and all their hearts are flame.\nYea, I have bound upon the necks of them\nThe harness of my rites. And with them all\nThe seed of womankind from hut and hall\nOf Thebes, hath this my magic goaded out.\nAnd there, with the old King's daughters, in a rout\nConfused, they make their dwelling-place between\nThe roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.\nThus shall this Thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,\nLearn and forget not, till she crave her part\nIn mine adoring; thus must I speak clear\nTo save my mother's fame, and crown me here\nAs true God, born by Semel\u00c3\u00aa to Zeus.\n\n  Now Cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use\nOf royal honour to his daughter's son\nPentheus; who on my body hath begun\nA war with God. He thrusteth me away\nFrom due drink-offering, and, when men pray,\nMy name entreats not. Therefore on his own\nHead and his people's shall my power be shown.\nThen to another land, when all things here\nAre well, must I fare onward, making clear\nMy godhead's might. But should this Theban town\nEssay with wrath and battle to drag down\nMy maids, lo, in their path myself shall be,\nAnd maniac armies battled after me!\nFor this I veil my godhead with the wan\nForm of the things that die, and walk as Man.\n\n  O Brood of Tmolus o'er the wide world flown,\nO Lydian band, my chosen and mine own,\nDamsels uplifted o'er the orient deep\nTo wander where I wander, and to sleep\nWhere I sleep; up, and wake the old sweet sound,\nThe clang that I and mystic Rhea found,\nThe Timbrel of the Mountain! Gather all\nThebes to your song round Pentheus' royal hall.\nI seek my new-made worshippers, to guide\nTheir dances up Kithaeron's pine-clad side.\n\n[_As he departs, there comes stealing in from the left a band of fifteen\n    Eastern Women, the light of the sunrise streaming upon their long\n    white robes and ivy-bound hair. They wear fawn-skins over the robes,\n    and carry some of them timbrels, some pipes and other instruments.\n    Many bear the thyrsus, or sacred Wand, made of reed ringed with ivy.\n    They enter stealthily till they see that the place is empty, and\n    then begin their mystic song of worship._\n\n                   CHORUS.\n\n                 _A Maiden._\n\nFrom Asia, from the dayspring that uprises,\n  To Bromios ever glorying we came.\nWe laboured for our Lord in many guises;\nWe toiled, but the toil is as the prize is;\n  Thou Mystery, we hail thee by thy name!\n\n                 _Another._\n\nWho lingers in the road?

Here comes in speed\nPentheus, Ech\u00c3\u00aeon's son, whom I have raised\nTo rule my people in my stead.--Amazed\nHe seems. Stand close, and mark what we shall hear.\n\n[_The two stand back, partially concealed, while there enters in hot\n    haste_ PENTHEUS, _followed by a bodyguard. He is speaking to the_\n    SOLDIER _in command_.\n\n                  PENTHEUS.\n\nScarce had I crossed our borders, when mine ear\nWas caught by this strange rumour, that our own\nWives, our own sisters, from their hearths are flown\nTo wild and secret rites; and cluster there\nHigh on the shadowy hills, with dance and prayer\nTo adore this new-made God, this Dionyse,\nWhate'er he be!--And in their companies\nDeep wine-jars stand, and ever and anon\nAway into the loneliness now one\nSteals forth, and now a second, maid or dame,\nWhere love lies waiting, not of God! The flame,\nThey say, of Bacchios wraps them. Bacchios! Nay,\n'Tis more to Aphrodite that they pray.\n  Howbeit, all that I have found, my men\nHold bound and shackled in our dungeon den;\nThe rest, I will go hunt them! Aye, and snare\nMy birds with nets of iron, to quell their prayer\nAnd mountain song and rites of rascaldom!\n  They tell me, too, there is a stranger come,\nA man of charm and spell, from Lydian seas,\nA head all gold and cloudy fragrancies,\nA wine-red cheek, and eyes that hold the light\nOf the very Cyprian. Day and livelong night\nHe haunts amid the damsels, o'er each lip\nDangling his cup of joyance!--Let me grip\nHim once, but once, within these walls, right swift\nThat wand shall cease its music, and that drift\nOf tossing curls lie still--when my rude sword\nFalls between neck and trunk! 'Tis all his word,\nThis tale of Dionysus; how that same\nBabe that was blasted by the lightning flame\nWith his dead mother, for that mother's lie,\nWas re-conceived, born perfect from the thigh\nOf Zeus, and now is God! What call ye these?\nDreams? Gibes of the unknown wanderer? Blasphemies\nThat crave the very gibbet?\n                            Stay! God wot,\nHere is another marvel! See I not\nIn motley fawn-skins robed the vision-seer\nTeiresias? And my mother's father here--\nO depth of scorn!--adoring with the wand\nOf Bacchios?--Father!--Nay, mine eyes are fond;\nIt is not your white heads so fancy-flown!\nIt cannot be! Cast off that ivy crown,\nO mine own mother's sire! Set free that hand\nThat cowers about its staff.\n                           'Tis thou hast planned\nThis work, Teiresias! 'Tis thou must set\nAnother altar and another yet\nAmongst us, watch new birds, and win more hire\nOf gold, interpreting new signs of fire!\nBut for thy silver hairs, I tell thee true,\nThou now wert sitting chained amid thy crew\nOf raving damsels, for this evil dream\nThou hast brought us, of new Gods! When once the gleam\nOf grapes hath lit a Woman's Festival,\nIn all their prayers is no more health at all!\n\n             LEADER OF THE CHORUS\n   (_the words are not heard by_ PENTHEUS).\n\nInjurious King, hast thou no care for God,\nNor Cadmus, sower of the Giants' Sod,\nLife-spring to great Ech\u00c3\u00aeon and to thee?\n\n                  TEIRESIAS.\n\nGood words, my son, come easily, when he\nThat speaks is wise, and speaks but for the right.\nElse come they never! Swift are thine, and bright\nAs though with thought, yet have no thought at all.\n  Lo, this new God, whom thou dost flout withal,\nI cannot speak the greatness wherewith He\nIn Hellas shall be great! Two spirits there be,\nYoung Prince, that in man's world are first of worth.\nD\u00c3\u00aam\u00c3\u00aat\u00c3\u00aar one is named; she is the Earth--\nCall her which name thou will!--who feeds man's frame\nWith sustenance of things dry. And that which came\nHer work to perfect, second, is the Power\nFrom Semel\u00c3\u00aa born. He found the liquid shower\nHid in the grape. He rests man's spirit dim\nFrom grieving, when the vine exalteth him.\nHe giveth sleep to sink the fretful day\nIn cool forgetting. Is there any way\nWith man's sore heart, save only to forget?\n  Yea, being God, the blood of him is set\nBefore the Gods in sacrifice, that we\nFor his sake may be blest.--And so, to thee,\nThat fable shames him, how this God was knit\nInto God's flesh? Nay, learn the truth of it,\nCleared from the false.--When from that deadly light\nZeus saved the babe, and up to Olympus' height\nRaised him, and Hera's wrath would cast him thence,\nThen Zeus devised him a divine defence.\nA fragment of the world-encircling fire\nHe rent apart, and wrought to his desire\nOf shape and hue, in the image of the child,\nAnd gave to Hera's rage. And so, beguiled\nBy change and passing time, this tale was born,\nHow the babe-god was hidden in the torn\nFlesh of his sire. He hath no shame thereby.\n  A prophet is he likewise. Prophecy\nCleaves to all frenzy, but beyond all else\nTo frenzy of prayer. Then in us verily dwells\nThe God himself, and speaks the thing to be.\nYea, and of Ares' realm a part hath he.\nWhen mortal armies, mail\u00c3\u00a8d and arrayed,\nHave in strange fear, or ever blade met blade,\nFled maddened, 'tis this God hath palsied them.\nAye, over Delphi's rock-built diadem\nThou yet shalt see him leaping with his train\nOf fire across the twin-peaked mountain-plain,\nFlaming the darkness with his mystic wand,\nAnd great in Hellas.--List and understand,\nKing Pentheus! Dream not thou that force is power;\nNor, if thou hast a thought, and that thought sour\nAnd sick, oh, dream not thought is wisdom!--Up,\nReceive this God to Thebes; pour forth the cup\nOf sacrifice, and pray, and wreathe thy brow.\n  Thou fearest for the damsels? Think thee now;\nHow toucheth this the part of Dionyse\nTo hold maids pure perforce? In them it lies,\nAnd their own hearts; and in the wildest rite\nCometh no stain to her whose heart is white.\n  Nay, mark me! Thou hast thy joy, when the Gate\nStands thronged, and Pentheus' name is lifted great\nAnd high by Thebes in clamour; shall not He\nRejoice in his due meed of majesty?\n  Howbeit, this Cadmus whom thou scorn'st and I\nWill wear His crown, and tread His dances! Aye,\nOur hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod!\nI will not lift mine arm to war with God\nFor thee nor all thy words. Madness most fell\nIs on thee, madness wrought by some dread spell,\nBut not by spell nor leechcraft to be cured!\n\n                   CHORUS.\n\nGrey prophet, worthy of Phoebus is thy word,\nAnd wise in honouring Bromios, our great God.\n\n                   CADMUS.\n\nMy son, right well Teiresias points thy road.\nOh, make thine habitation here with us,\nNot lonely, against men's uses. Hazardous\nIs this quick bird-like beating of thy thought\nWhere no thought dwells.--Grant that this God be naught,\nYet let that Naught be Somewhat in thy mouth;\nLie boldly, and say He Is! So north and south\nShall marvel, how there sprang a thing divine\nFrom Semel\u00c3\u00aa's flesh, and honour all our line.\n                              [_Drawing nearer to_ PENTHEUS.\n  Is there not blood before thine eyes even now?\nOur lost Actaeon's blood, whom long ago\nHis own red hounds through yonder forest dim\nTore unto death, because he vaunted him\nAgainst most holy Artemis?

And seek amain\nThis girl-faced stranger, that hath wrought such bane\nTo all Thebes, preying on our maids and wives.\nSeek till ye find; and lead him here in gyves,\nTill he be judged and stoned, and weep in blood\nThe day he troubled Pentheus with his God!\n\n[_The guards set forth in two bodies_; PENTHEUS _goes into the Castle_.\n\n                  TEIRESIAS.\n\nHard heart, how little dost thou know what seed\nThou sowest!

'Twere ill,\nIf two old men should fall by the roadway. Still,\nCome what come may, our service shall be done\nTo Bacchios, the All-Father's mystic son.\n  O Pentheus, named of sorrow!

The one\nAutono\u00c3\u00ab led, one Ino, one thine own\nMother, Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa. There beneath the trees\nSleeping they lay, like wild things flung at ease\nIn the forest; one half sinking on a bed\nOf deep pine greenery; one with careless head\nAmid the fallen oak leaves; all most cold\nIn purity--not as thy tale was told\nOf wine-cups and wild music and the chase\nFor love amid the forest's loneliness.\nThen rose the Queen Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa suddenly\nAmid her band, and gave the God's wild cry,\n\"Awake, ye Bacchanals! I hear the sound\nOf horn\u00c3\u00a8d kine. Awake ye!\"--Then, all round,\nAlert, the warm sleep fallen from their eyes,\nA marvel of swift ranks I saw them rise,\nDames young and old, and gentle maids unwed\nAmong them. O'er their shoulders first they shed\nTheir tresses, and caught up the fallen fold\nOf mantles where some clasp had loosened hold,\nAnd girt the dappled fawn-skins in with long\nQuick snakes that hissed and writhed with quivering tongue.\nAnd one a young fawn held, and one a wild\nWolf cub, and fed them with white milk, and smiled\nIn love, young mothers with a mother's breast\nAnd babes at home forgotten! Then they pressed\nWreathed ivy round their brows, and oaken sprays\nAnd flowering bryony. And one would raise\nHer wand and smite the rock, and straight a jet\nOf quick bright water came. Another set\nHer thyrsus in the bosomed earth, and there\nWas red wine that the God sent up to her,\nA darkling fountain. And if any lips\nSought whiter draughts, with dipping finger-tips\nThey pressed the sod, and gushing from the ground\nCame springs of milk. And reed-wands ivy-crowned\nRan with sweet honey, drop by drop.--O King,\nHadst thou been there, as I, and seen this thing,\nWith prayer and most high wonder hadst thou gone\nTo adore this God whom now thou rail'st upon!\n  Howbeit, the kine-wardens and shepherds straight\nCame to one place, amazed, and held debate;\nAnd one being there who walked the streets and scanned\nThe ways of speech, took lead of them whose hand\nKnew but the slow soil and the solemn hill,\nAnd flattering spoke, and asked: \"Is it your will,\nMasters, we stay the mother of the King,\nAg\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa, from her lawless worshipping,\nAnd win us royal thanks?\"--And this seemed good\nTo all; and through the branching underwood\nWe hid us, cowering in the leaves. And there\nThrough the appointed hour they made their prayer\nAnd worship of the Wand, with one accord\nOf heart and cry--\"Iacchos, Bromios, Lord,\nGod of God born!\"--And all the mountain felt,\nAnd worshipped with them; and the wild things knelt\nAnd ramped and gloried, and the wilderness\nWas filled with moving voices and dim stress.\n  Soon, as it chanced, beside my thicket-close\nThe Queen herself passed dancing, and I rose\nAnd sprang to seize her. But she turned her face\nUpon me: \"Ho, my rovers of the chase,\nMy wild White Hounds, we are hunted! Up, each rod\nAnd follow, follow, for our Lord and God!\"\nThereat, for fear they tear us, all we fled\nAmazed; and on, with hand unweapon\u00c3\u00a8d\nThey swept toward our herds that browsed the green\nHill grass. Great uddered kine then hadst thou seen\nBellowing in sword-like hands that cleave and tear,\nA live steer riven asunder, and the air\nTossed with rent ribs or limbs of cloven tread,\nAnd flesh upon the branches, and a red\nRain from the deep green pines. Yea, bulls of pride,\nHorns swift to rage, were fronted and aside\nFlung stumbling, by those multitudinous hands\nDragged pitilessly. And swifter were the bands\nOf garb\u00c3\u00a8d flesh and bone unbound withal\nThan on thy royal eyes the lids may fall.\n  Then on like birds, by their own speed upborne,\nThey swept toward the plains of waving corn\nThat lie beside Asopus' banks, and bring\nTo Thebes the rich fruit of her harvesting.\nOn Hysiae and Erythrae that lie nursed\nAmid Kithaeron's bowering rocks, they burst\nDestroying, as a foeman's army comes.\nThey caught up little children from their homes,\nHigh on their shoulders, babes unheld, that swayed\nAnd laughed and fell not; all a wreck they made;\nYea, bronze and iron did shatter, and in play\nStruck hither and thither, yet no wound had they;\nCaught fire from out the hearths, yea, carried hot\nFlames in their tresses and were scorch\u00c3\u00a8d not!\n  The village folk in wrath took spear and sword,\nAnd turned upon the Bacchae. Then, dread Lord,\nThe wonder was. For spear nor barb\u00c3\u00a8d brand\nCould scathe nor touch the damsels; but the Wand,\nThe soft and wreath\u00c3\u00a8d wand their white hands sped,\nBlasted those men and quelled them, and they fled\nDizzily. Sure some God was in these things!\n  And the holy women back to those strange springs\nReturned, that God had sent them when the day\nDawned, on the upper heights; and washed away\nThe stain of battle. And those girdling snakes\nHissed out to lap the waterdrops from cheeks\nAnd hair and breast.\n                      Therefore I counsel thee,\nO King, receive this Spirit, whoe'er he be,\nTo Thebes in glory. Greatness manifold\nIs all about him; and the tale is told\nThat this is he who first to man did give\nThe grief-assuaging vine. Oh, let him live;\nFor if he die, then Love herself is slain,\nAnd nothing joyous in the world again!\n\n                   LEADER.\n\nAlbeit I tremble, and scarce may speak my thought\nTo a king's face, yet will I hide it not.\nDionyse is God, no God more true nor higher!\n\n                  PENTHEUS.\n\nIt bursts hard by us, like a smothered fire,\nThis frenzy of Bacchic women! All my land\nIs made their mock.--This needs an iron hand!\n  Ho, Captain! Quick to the Electran Gate;\nBid gather all my men-at-arms thereat;\nCall all that spur the charger, all who know\nTo wield the orb\u00c3\u00a8d targe or bend the bow;\nWe march to war!--'Fore God, shall women dare\nSuch deeds against us? 'Tis too much to bear!\n\n                  DIONYSUS.\n\nThou mark'st me not, O King, and holdest light\nMy solemn words; yet, in thine own despite,\nI warn thee still. Lift thou not up thy spear\nAgainst a God, but hold thy peace, and fear\nHis wrath! He will not brook it, if thou fright\nHis Chosen from the hills of their delight.\n\n                  PENTHEUS.\n\nPeace, thou! And if for once thou hast slipped thy chain,\nGive thanks!--Or shall I knot thine arms again?\n\n                  DIONYSUS.\n\nBetter to yield him prayer and sacrifice\nThan kick against the pricks, since Dionyse\nIs God, and thou but mortal.\n\n                  PENTHEUS.\n\n                                That will I!\nYea, sacrifice of women's blood, to cry\nHis name through all Kithaeron!\n\n                  DIONYSUS.\n\n                                  Ye shall fly,\nAll, and abase your shields of bronzen rim\nBefore their wands.\n\n                  PENTHEUS.\n\n                        There is no way with him,\nThis stranger that so dogs us! Well or ill\nI may entreat him, he must babble still!\n\n                  DIONYSUS.\n\nWait, good my friend!

And there\nThe Maenad maidens sate; in toil they were,\nBusily glad. Some with an ivy chain\nTracked a worn wand to toss its locks again;\nSome, wild in joyance, like young steeds set free,\nMade answering songs of mystic melody.\n  But my poor master saw not the great band\nBefore him. \"Stranger,\" cried he, \"where we stand\nMine eyes can reach not these false saints of thine.\nMount we the bank, or some high-shouldered pine,\nAnd I shall see their follies clear!\" At that\nThere came a marvel. For the Stranger straight\nTouched a great pine-tree's high and heavenward crown,\nAnd lower, lower, lower, urged it down\nTo the herbless floor. Round like a bending bow,\nOr slow wheel's rim a joiner forces to,\nSo in those hands that tough and mountain stem\nBowed slow--oh, strength not mortal dwelt in them!--\nTo the very earth. And there he set the King,\nAnd slowly, lest it cast him in its spring,\nLet back the young and straining tree, till high\nIt towered again amid the towering sky;\nAnd Pentheus in the branches! Well, I ween,\nHe saw the Maenads then, and well was seen!\nFor scarce was he aloft, when suddenly\nThere was no Stranger any more with me,\nBut out of Heaven a Voice--oh, what voice else?--\n'Twas He that called! \"Behold, O damosels,\nI bring ye him who turneth to despite\nBoth me and ye, and darkeneth my great Light.\n'Tis yours to avenge!\" So spake he, and there came\n'Twixt earth and sky a pillar of high flame.\nAnd silence took the air, and no leaf stirred\nIn all the forest dell. Thou hadst not heard\nIn that vast silence any wild thing's cry.\nAnd up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,\nAgaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.\nThen came the Voice again. And when they knew\nTheir God's clear call, old Cadmus' royal brood,\nUp, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,\nOn flying feet they came, his mother blind,\nAg\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa, and her sisters, and behind\nAll the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,\nThrough the angry rocks and torrent-tossing glen,\nUntil they spied him in the dark pine-tree:\nThen climbed a crag hard by and furiously\nSome sought to stone him, some their wands would fling\nLance-wise aloft, in cruel targeting.\nBut none could strike. The height o'ertopped their rage,\nAnd there he clung, unscathed, as in a cage\nCaught. And of all their strife no end was found.\nThen, \"Hither,\" cried Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa; \"stand we round\nAnd grip the stem, my Wild Ones, till we take\nThis climbing cat-o'-the-mount! He shall not make\nA tale of God's high dances!\" Out then shone\nArm upon arm, past count, and closed upon\nThe pine, and gripped; and the ground gave, and down\nIt reeled. And that high sitter from the crown\nOf the green pine-top, with a shrieking cry\nFell, as his mind grew clear, and there hard by\nWas horror visible. 'Twas his mother stood\nO'er him, first priestess of those rites of blood.\nHe tore the coif, and from his head away\nFlung it, that she might know him, and not slay\nTo her own misery. He touched the wild\nCheek, crying: \"Mother, it is I, thy child,\nThy Pentheus, born thee in Ech\u00c3\u00aeon's hall!\nHave mercy, Mother! Let it not befall\nThrough sin of mine, that thou shouldst slay thy son!\"\n  But she, with lips a-foam and eyes that run\nLike leaping fire, with thoughts that ne'er should be\nOn earth, possessed by Bacchios utterly,\nStays not nor hears. Round his left arm she put\nBoth hands, set hard against his side her foot,\nDrew . . . and the shoulder severed!--Not by might\nOf arm, but easily, as the God made light\nHer hand's essay. And at the other side\nWas Ino rending; and the torn flesh cried,\nAnd on Autono\u00c3\u00ab pressed, and all the crowd\nOf ravening arms. Yea, all the air was loud\nWith groans that faded into sobbing breath,\nDim shrieks, and joy, and triumph-cries of death.\nAnd here was borne a severed arm, and there\nA hunter's booted foot; white bones lay bare\nWith rending; and swift hands ensanguin\u00c3\u00a8d\nTossed as in sport the flesh of Pentheus dead.\n  His body lies afar. The precipice\nHath part, and parts in many an interstice\nLurk of the tangled woodland--no light quest\nTo find. And, ah, the head! Of all the rest,\nHis mother hath it, pierced upon a wand,\nAs one might pierce a lion's, and through the land,\nLeaving her sisters in their dancing place,\nBears it on high! Yea, to these walls her face\nWas set, exulting in her deed of blood,\nCalling upon her Bromios, her God,\nHer Comrade, Fellow-Render of the Prey,\nHer All-Victorious, to whom this day\nShe bears in triumph . . . her own broken heart!\n  For me, after that sight, I will depart\nBefore Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa comes.--Oh, to fulfil\nGod's laws, and have no thought beyond His will,\nIs man's best treasure. Aye, and wisdom true,\nMethinks, for things of dust to cleave unto!\n\n                 [_The_ MESSENGER _departs into the Castle_.\n\n                   CHORUS.\n\n               _Some Maidens._\n\n      Weave ye the dance, and call\n            Praise to God!\n      Bless ye the Tyrant's fall!\n            Down is trod\n      Pentheus, the Dragon's Seed!\n      Wore he the woman's weed?\n      Clasped he his death indeed,\n            Clasped the rod?\n\n               _A Bacchanal._\n\nYea, the wild ivy lapt him, and the doomed\nWild Bull of Sacrifice before him loomed!\n\n                  _Others._\n\n      Ye who did Bromios scorn,\n            Praise Him the more,\n      Bacchanals, Cadmus-born;\n            Praise with sore\n      Agony, yea, with tears!\n      Great are the gifts he bears!\n      Hands that a mother rears\n            Red with gore!\n\n                   LEADER.\n\nBut stay, Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa cometh!

The Myth, as implied by Euripides. Semel\u00c3\u00aa, daughter of Cadmus, being\nloved by Zeus, asked her divine lover to appear to her once in his full\nglory; he came, a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the ecstasy of which\nSemel\u00c3\u00aa died, giving premature birth to a son. Zeus, to save this child's\nlife and make him truly God as well as Man, tore open his own flesh and\ntherein fostered the child till in due time, by a miraculous and\nmysterious Second Birth, the child of Semel\u00c3\u00aa came to full life as God.\n\n2. The Religion of Dionysus is hard to formulate or even describe, both\nbecause of its composite origins and because of its condition of\nconstant vitality, fluctuation, and development.\n\n(_a_) The first datum, apparently, is the introduction from Thrace of\nthe characteristic God of the wild northern mountains, a God of\nIntoxication, of Inspiration, a giver of superhuman or immortal life.\nHis worship is superposed upon that of divers old Tree or Vegetation\nGods, already worshipped in Greece. He becomes specially the God of the\nVine. Originally a god of the common folk, despised and unauthorised, he\nis eventually so strong as to be adopted into the Olympian hierarchy as\nthe \"youngest\" of the Gods, son of Zeus. His \"Olympian\" name, so to\nspeak, is Dionysus, but in his worship he is addressed by numbers of\nnames, more or less mystic and secret--Bromios, Bacchios or Baccheus,\nIacchos, Eleuthercus, Zagreus, Sabazios, &c. Some of these may be the\nnames of old spirits whom he has displaced; some are his own Thracian\nnames. Bromos and Sabaja, for instance, seem to have been Thracian names\nfor two kinds of intoxicating drink. Bacchos means a \"wand.\" Together\nwith his many names, he has many shapes, especially appearing as a Bull\nand a Serpent.\n\n(_b_) This religion, very primitive and barbarous, but possessing a\nstrong hold over the emotions of the common people, was seized upon and\ntransfigured by the great wave of religious reform, known under the name\nof Orphism, which swept over Greece and South Italy in the sixth century\nB.C., and influenced the teachings of such philosophers as Pythagoras,\nAristeas, Empedocles, and the many writers on purification and the world\nafter death. Orphism may very possibly represent an ancient Cretan\nreligion in clash or fusion with one from Thrace. At any rate, it was\ngrafted straight upon the Dionysus-worship, and, without rationalising,\nspiritualised and reformed it. Ascetic, mystical, ritualistic, and\nemotional, Orphism easily excited both enthusiasm and ridicule. It lent\nitself both to inspired saintliness and to imposture. In doctrine it\nlaid especial stress upon sin, and the sacerdotal purification of sin;\non the eternal reward due beyond the grave to the pure and the impure,\nthe pure living in an eternal ecstasy--\"perpetual intoxication,\" as\nPlato satirically calls it--the impure toiling through long ages to wash\nout their stains. It recast in various ways the myth of Dionysus, and\nespecially the story of his Second Birth. All true worshippers become in\na mystical sense one with the God; they are born again and are\n\"Bacchoi.\" Dionysus being the God within, the perfectly pure soul is\npossessed by the God wholly, and becomes nothing but the God.\n\nBased on very primitive rites and feelings, on the religion of men who\nmade their gods in the image of snakes and bulls and fawns, because they\nhardly felt any difference of kind between themselves and the animals,\nthe worship of Dionysus kept always this feeling of kinship with wild\nthings. The beautiful side of this feeling is vividly conspicuous in\n_The Bacchae_. And the horrible side is not in the least concealed.\n\nA curious relic of primitive superstition and cruelty remained firmly\nimbedded in Orphism--a doctrine irrational and unintelligible, and for\nthat very reason wrapped in the deepest and most sacred mystery: a\nbelief in the sacrifice of Dionysus himself, and the purification of man\nby his blood.\n\nIt seems possible that the savage Thracians, in the fury of their\nworship on the mountains, when they were possessed by the God and became\n\"wild beasts,\" actually tore with their teeth and hands any hares,\ngoats, fawns, or the like that they came across. There survives a\nconstant tradition of inspired Bacchanals in their miraculous strength\ntearing even bulls asunder--a feat, happily, beyond the bounds of human\npossibility. The wild beast that tore was, of course, the savage God\nhimself. And by one of those curious confusions of thought, which seem\nso inconceivable to us and so absolutely natural and obvious to\nprimitive men, the beast torn was also the God! The Orphic congregations\nof later times, in their most holy gatherings, solemnly partook of the\nblood of a bull, which was, by a mystery, the blood of Dionysus-Zagreus\nhimself, the \"Bull of God,\" slain in sacrifice for the purification of\nman. And the Maenads of poetry and myth, among more beautiful proofs of\ntheir superhuman or infra-human character, have always to tear bulls in\npieces and taste of the blood. It is noteworthy, and throws much light\non the spirit of Orphism, that apart from this sacramental tasting of\nthe blood, the Orphic worshipper held it an abomination to eat the flesh\nof animals at all. The same religious fervour and zeal for purity which\nmade him reject the pollution of animal food, made him at the same time\ncling to a ceremonial which would utterly disgust the ordinary hardened\nflesh-eater. It fascinated him just because it was so incredibly\nprimitive and uncanny; because it was a mystery which transcended\nreason!\n\nIt will be observed that Euripides, though certainly familiar with\nOrphism--which he mentions in _The Hippolytus_ and treated at length in\n_The Cretans_ (see Appendix)--has in _The Bacchae_ gone back behind\nOrphism to the more primitive stuff from which it was made. He has\nlittle reference to any specially Orphic doctrine; not a word, for\ninstance, about the immortality of the soul. And his idealisation or\nspiritualisation of Dionysus-worship proceeds along the lines of his\nown thought, not on those already fixed by the Orphic teachers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nP. 80, l. 17, Asia all that by the salt sea lies, &c.], _i.e._ the\ncoasts of Asia Minor inhabited by Greeks, Ionia, Aeolis, and Doris.\n\nP. 80, l. 27, From Dian seed.]--Dian=belonging to Zeus. The name\nDionysus seemed to be derived from [Greek: Dios], the genitive of\n\"Zeus.\"\n\nP. 81, l. 50, Should this Theban town essay with wrath and battle,\n&c.]--This suggestion of a possibility which is never realised or\napproached is perhaps a mark of the unrevised condition of the play. The\nsame may be said of the repetitions in the Prologue.\n\nPp. 82-86, ll. 64-169.--This first song of the Chorus covers a great\ndeal of Bacchic doctrine and myth. The first strophe, \"Oh blessed he in\nall wise,\" &c., describes the bliss of Bacchic purity; the antistrophe\ngives the two births of Dionysus, from Semel\u00c3\u00aa and from the body of Zeus,\nmentioning his mystic epiphanies as Bull and as Serpent. The next\nstrophe is an appeal to Thebes, the birthplace or \"nurse\" of the God's\nmother, Semel\u00c3\u00aa; the antistrophe, an appeal to the cavern in Crete, the\nbirthplace of Zeus, the God's father, and the original home of the\nmystic Timbrel. The Epode, or closing song, is full, not of doctrine,\nbut of the pure poetry of the worship.\n\nPp. 86-95, ll. 170-369, Teiresias and Cadmus.]--Teiresias seems to be\nnot a spokesman of the poet's own views--far from it--but a type of the\nmore cultured sort of Dionysiac priest, not very enlightened, but ready\nto abate some of the extreme dogmas of his creed if he may keep the\nrest. Cadmus, quite a different character, takes a very human and\nearthly point of view: the God is probably a true God; but even if he is\nfalse, there is no great harm done, and the worship will bring renown to\nThebes and the royal family. It is noteworthy how full of pity Cadmus\nis--the sympathetic kindliness of the sons of this world as contrasted\nwith the pitilessness of gods and their devotees. See especially the\nlast scenes of the play. Even his final outburst of despair at not dying\nlike other men (p. 152), shows the same sympathetic humanity.\n\nPp. 89 ff., ll. 215-262.--Pentheus, though his case against the new\nworship is so good, and he might so easily have been made into a fine\nmartyr, like Hippolytus, is left harsh and unpleasant, and very close in\ntype to the ordinary \"tyrant\" of Greek tragedy (cf. p. 118). It is also\nnoteworthy, I think, that he is, as it were, out of tone with the other\ncharacters. He belongs to a different atmosphere, like, to take a recent\ninstance, Golaud in _Pell\u00c3\u00a9as et M\u00c3\u00a9lisande_.\n\nP. 91, l. 263, Injurious King, &c.]--It is a mark of a certain yielding\nto stage convention in Euripides' later style, that he allows the Chorus\nLeader to make remarks which are not \"asides,\" but are yet not heard or\nnoticed by anybody.\n\nP. 91, l. 264, Sower of the Giants' sod.]--Cadmus, by divine guidance,\nslew a dragon and sowed the teeth of it like seed in the \"Field of\nAres.\" From the teeth rose a harvest of Earth-born, or \"Giant\" warriors,\nof whom Ech\u00c3\u00aeon was one.\n\nP. 92, l. 287, Learn the truth of it, cleared from the false.]--This\ntimid essay in rationalism reminds one of similar efforts in Pindar\n(e.g. _Ol._ i.). It is the product of a religious and unspeculative\nmind, not feeling difficulties itself, but troubled by other people's\nquestions and objections. (See above on Teiresias.)\n\nP. 92, l. 292, The world-encircling Fire.]--This fire, or ether, was the\nordinary material of which phantoms or apparitions were made.\n\nPp. 93-95, ll. 330-369.--These three speeches are very clearly\ncontrasted. Cadmus, thoroughly human, thinking of sympathy and\nexpediency, and vividly remembering the fate of his other grandson,\nActaeon; Pentheus, angry and \"tyrannical\"; Teiresias speaking like a\nChristian priest of the Middle Ages, almost like Tennyson's Becket.\n\nP. 95, l. 370.--The goddess [Greek: Hosia], \"Purity,\" seems to be one of\nthe many abstractions which were half personified by philosophy and by\nOrphism. It is possible that the word is really adjectival, \"Immaculate\nOne,\" and originally an epithet of some more definite goddess, _e.g._ as\nMiss Harrison suggests, of Nemesis.\n\nIn this and other choruses it is very uncertain how the lines should be\ndistributed between the whole chorus, the two semi-choruses, and the\nvarious individual choreutae.\n\nPp. 97-98, ll. 402-430.--For the meaning of these lines, see\nIntroduction, pp. lxi, lxii.\n\nP. 100, l. 471, These emblems.]--There were generally associated with\nmysteries, or special forms of worship, certain relics or sacred\nimplements, without which the rites could not be performed. Cf. Hdt.\nvii. 153, where Telines of Gela stole the sacred implements or emblems\nof the nether gods, so that no worship could be performed, and the town\nwas, as it were, excommunicated.\n\nP. 103, ll. 493 ff., _The soldiers cut off the tress._]--The stage\ndirections here are difficult. It is conceivable that none of Pentheus'\nthreats are carried out at all; that the God mysteriously paralyses the\nhand that is lifted to take his rod without Pentheus himself knowing it.\nBut I think it more likely that the humiliation of Dionysus is made, as\nfar as externals go, complete, and that it is not till later that he\nbegins to show his superhuman powers.\n\nP. 104, l. 508, So let it be.]--The name Pentheus suggests 'mourner,'\nfrom _penthos_, 'mourning.'\n\nP. 105, l. 519, Achelo\u00c3\u00bcs' roaming daughter.]--Achelo\u00c3\u00bcs was the Father of\nall Rivers.\n\nP. 107, l. 556, In thine own Nysa.]--An unknown divine mountain, formed\napparently to account for the second part of the name Dionysus.\n\nP. 107, l. 571, Cross the Lydias, &c.]--These are rivers of Thrace which\nDionysus must cross in his passage from the East, the Lydias, the Axios,\nand some other, perhaps the Haliacmon, which is called \"the\nfather-stream of story.\"\n\nP. 108, l. 579, A Voice, a Voice.]--Bromios, the God of Many\nVoices--for, whatever the real derivation, the fifth-century Greeks\ncertainly associated the name with [Greek: brem\u00c3\u00b4], 'to roar'--manifests\nhimself as a voice here and below (p. 136).\n\nPp. 109-112, ll. 602-641, Ye Damsels of the Morning Hills, &c.]--This\nscene in longer metre always strikes me as a little unlike the style of\nEuripides, and inferior. It may mark one of the parts left unfinished\nby the poet, and written in by his son. But it may be that I have not\nunderstood it.\n\nP. 118, ll. 781 ff., Call all who spur the charger, &c.]--The typical\n'Ercles vein' of the tragic tyrant.\n\nPp. 120-124, ll. 810 ff.--This scene of the 'hypnotising'--if one may\nuse the word--of Pentheus probably depends much on the action, which,\nhowever, I have not ventured to prescribe. Pentheus seems to struggle\nagainst the process all through, to be amazed at himself for consenting,\nwhile constantly finding fresh reasons for doing so.\n\nP. 121, l. 822, Am I a woman, then?]--The robe and coif were, in the\noriginal legend, marks of the Thracian dress worn by the Thracian\nfollowers of Dionysus, and notably by Orpheus. The tradition became\nfixed that Pentheus wore such a robe and coif; and to the Greeks of\nEuripides' time such a dress seemed to be a woman's. Hence this turn of\nthe story (cf. above, p. 167).\n\nP. 125, ll. 877-881.--The refrain of this chorus about the fawn is\ndifficult to interpret. I have practically interpolated the third line\n(\"To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait\"), in order (1) to\nshow the connection of ideas; (2) to make clearer the meaning (as I\nunderstand it) of the two Orphic formul\u00c3\u00a6, \"What is beautiful is beloved\nfor ever,\" and \"A hand uplifted over the head of Hate.\" If I am wrong,\nthe refrain is probably a mere cry for revenge, in the tone of the\nrefrain, \"Hither for doom and deed,\" on p. 132. It is one of the many\npassages where there is a sharp antagonism between the two spirits of\nthe Chorus, first, as furious Bacchanals, and, secondly, as exponents of\nthe idealised Bacchic religion of Euripides, which is so strongly\nexpressed in the rest of this wonderful lyric.\n\nP. 127, l. 920, Is it a Wild Bull, this?]--Pentheus, in his Bacchic\npossession, sees fitfully the mystic shapes of the God beneath the human\ndisguise. This second-sight, the exaltation of spirit, and the feeling\nof supernatural strength come to Pentheus as they came to the two Old\nMen. But to them the change came peacefully and for good; to Pentheus it\ncomes by force, stormily and for evil, because his will was against the\nGod.\n\nP. 131, l. 976, O hounds raging and blind.]--_i.e._ Spirits of Madness.\nThis lyric prepares us for what follows, especially for Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa's\ndelusion, which otherwise might have been hard to understand. I have\ntried to keep the peculiar metre of the original, the dochmiac, with a\nfew simple licences. The scheme is based on u-- --u-- or --uu --u-- the\nlatter being much commoner.\n\nP. 133, ll. 997-1011.--The greater part of this chorus is generally\nabandoned as unintelligible and corrupt. The last ten lines (\"Knowledge,\nwe are not foes,\" &c.) will, I think, make sense if we accept a very\nslight conjecture of my own, [Greek: aent\u00c3\u00b4n], \"let them blow\", instead\nof the impossible [Greek: aei t\u00c3\u00b4n]. The four lines before that (\"A\nstrait pitiless mind,\" &c.) are an almost literal translation of the MS.\nreading, which, however, is incorrect in metre, and therefore cannot be\nexactly what Euripides wrote.\n\nP. 134, l. 1036, And deem'st thou Thebes so beggared.]--The couplet is\nincomplete in the MS. But the sense needed is obvious.\n\nP. 137, l. 1120, Let it not befall through sin of mine, &c.]--This note\nof unselfish feeling, of pity and humanity, becomes increasingly marked\nin all the victims of Dionysus towards the end of the play, and\ncontrasts the more vividly with the God's pitilessness. Cadmus is always\ngentle, and always thinking of the sufferings of others; and, indeed, so\nis Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa, after her return to reason, though with more resentment\nagainst the oppressor.\n\nPp. 139-143, ll. 1165-1200.--This marvellous scene defies comment. But I\nmay be excused for remarking (1) that the psychological change of the\nchorus is, to my mind, proved by the words of the original, and does not\nin the least depend on my interpolated stage directions; (2) the\nextraordinary exultation of Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa is part of her Bacchic possession. It\nis not to be supposed that, if she had really killed a lion, such joy\nwould be the natural thing.\n\nP. 141, _after_ l. 1183, _The Leader tries to speak_, &c.]--It is also\npossible that by some error of a scribe two lines have been omitted in\nthe MS. But I think the explanation given in the text more probable and\nmore dramatic.\n\nP. 142, l. 1195, And Pentheus, O Mother?]--The Leader mentions Pentheus,\nI suppose, in order deliberately to test Ag\u00c3\u00a2v\u00c3\u00aa's delusion, to see if she\nis indeed utterly unconscious of the truth.\n\nP. 146, l. 1267, More shining than before, &c.]--The sight of the pure\nheaven brings back light to her mind--that is clear. But does she mean\nthat the sky is brighter because of her madness which still remains, or\nthat it is brighter now, after having been darkened in her madness?\n\nP. 149, l. 1313, And now I fare forth in dishonour.]--He has not yet\nbeen sentenced to exile, though he might well judge that after such\npollution all his family would be banished. But probably this is another\nmark of the unrevised state of the play.\n\nP. 151, l. 1330, For thou must change and be a Serpent Thing, &c.]--A\nprophecy like this is a very common occurrence in the last scenes of\nEuripides' tragedies. \"The subject of the play is really a long chain of\nevents. The poet fixes on some portion of it--the action of one day,\ngenerally speaking--and treats it as a piece of vivid concrete life, led\nup to by a merely narrative introduction (the Prologue), and melting\naway into a merely narrative close. The method is to our taste\nundramatic, but it is explicable enough. It falls in with the tendency\nof Greek art to finish, not with a climax, but with a lessening of\nstrain\" (_Greek Literature_, p. 267).\n\nThe prophecy was that Cadmus and Harmonia should be changed into\nserpents and should lead a host of barbarian invaders--identified with\nan Illyrian tribe, the Encheleis--against Hellas; they should prosper\nuntil they laid hands on the treasures of Delphi, and then be destroyed.\nHerodotus says that the Persians were influenced by this prophecy when\nthey refrained from attacking Delphi (Hdt. ix. 42).\n\n\nPrinted by Ballantyne, Hanson & Co.\nEdinburgh & London\n\n\n\n\n_BY THE SAME AUTHOR_\n\n\nHISTORY OF ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE.\n\nANDROMACHE: A Play.\n\nCARLYON SAHIB: A Play.\n\nTHE EXPLOITATION OF INFERIOR RACES, IN ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES:\n  An Essay in \"Liberalism and the Empire.\"\n\nEURIPIDIS FABULAE: Brevi Adnotatione Critica Instructae,\n  Vols.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":67,"split":"train"}
