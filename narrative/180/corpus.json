{"ori_id":"2b0d41cec61dc3b7faf7a011051cdbcacb55050b","title":"Prom Night (1980 film)","context":"Prom Night (1980 film)\n In 1974, 11-year-olds Wendy Richards, Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Nick McBride play hide and seek in an abandoned convent. 10-year-old Robin Hammond tries to join them, but they start teasing her by repeating \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\". Robin is then backed up towards a window from which she falls to her death. Instead of reporting the incident to the police, the children make a pact not to tell anyone what happened and keep the incident a secret, but after they leave, a shadow falls across Robin's body. Later a known rapist, Leonard Merch is mistakenly blamed for Robin's death and is arrested.\nSix years pass, Robin's family attend her memorial on the anniversary of her death. Robin's teenage sister and brother, Kim and Alex, are also preparing for the school prom to be held that evening. Their parents will also attend, as their father is the school principal. Kelly, Jude and Wendy begin receiving obscene phone calls from an unknown figure, while Nick ignores his ringing phone. Kim and Nick, whom she is dating, are attending prom together; Jude is asked by goofy jokester Seymour \"Slick\" Crane whom she meets by chance that morning; Kelly is going with her boyfriend Drew Shinnick (who is preoccupied with having sex with her despite objections), while Wendy, previously Nick's girlfriend, asks the school rebel, Lou Farmer with plans to embarrass Nick and Kim at prom.\nIn the changing room after gym class, Kim and Kelly discover the locker room mirror severely cracked and a shard missing. The offender blamed for Robin's death has escaped and Lt. McBride, Nick's father, investigates. Also during the day, Wendy, Jude and Kelly discover their year book photos in their lockers torn and stabbed with a piece of glass. During the senior prom, Kim and Nick perform a dance number to impress Wendy who had insisted Nick would be getting back with her after the prom. Later, Kelly and Drew make out in the changing room, but Kelly refuses to continue to full sex, resulting in Drew angrily leaving. As Kelly gets dressed, an unidentified figure wearing a ski mask and all-black clothing stealthily approaches her and slits her throat with a mirror shard. Jude and Slick have sex and smoke marijuana in Slick's van parked outside school grounds. Unbeknownst to them, they are being watched and are then attacked by the masked killer, who stabs Jude's throat. Slick struggles with the killer while attempting to drive away but the killer escapes from the van (with Slick inside) as it tumbles off a cliff and explodes into a wreckage. McBride, staking out the prom, is informed that the sex offender blamed for Robin's death has been caught. He is relieved and ends his scrutiny of the event.\nWendy in the bathroom is then confronted by the killer now wielding an axe and is chased through the school. After evading the killer several times, she is suddenly caught and killed after she screams upon discovering Kelly's body in a storage room. Kim and Nick prepare to be crowned prom king and queen but Wendy's plan is put into action by Lou and his lackeys who tie up Nick with Lou taking his crown and assuming his position back stage. Thinking he is Nick, the killer approaches behind Lou and decapitates him. Lou's head lands onto the dance floor, sending the partygoers fleeing in horror.\nKim finds Nick and frees him. As they prepare to escape, they are confronted by the killer who attacks Nick but not Kim. Eventually in the ensuing brawl, Kim bluntly strikes the killer's head with his own axe. She and the killer then stare at each other for a moment and Kim realizes who he really is. He runs outside where the police have arrived. As guns are raised Kim screams for Lt. McBride not to shoot him. The killer then collapses on the ground and is revealed to be Alex, who is Robin's twin. He tearfully tells his sister that Jude, Kelly, Wendy and Nick were responsible for their sister's death. The film ends as he cries Robin's name and dies. Kim sheds a tear for the death of another sibling.\n<html>\n<head><title>Prom Night Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Prom Night script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Prom Night script, Prom Night movie script, Prom Night film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Cars idle in the driveway awaiting\n          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.\n          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.\n\n          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.\n          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the\n          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward\n          the cars and the buses.\n\n          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,\n          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..\n          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-\n          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the\n          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a\n          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,\n          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in\n          school.

He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin.\n\n<b>                         ALEX\n<\/b>          Hey!\n\n<b>                         KIM\n<\/b>          You shouldn't have pulled away...\n          The DOORBELL RINGS.\n\n<b>                         KIM\n<\/b>\n<b>                         (CONTINUING)\n<\/b>          It's him!\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          80,\n<\/b>\n<b>          103 CONTINUED: (2) 103.\n<\/b>\n<b>                         ALE \n<\/b>          er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.\n          Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his\n          head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.\n\n<b>                         VIVIA N\n<\/b>          Robin!\n          She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond\n          grabs her, restraining her.\n          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.\n          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.\n          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's\n          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-\n          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red\n          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.\n          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his\n          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.\n          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of\n          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE\n          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.\n\n<b>          FADE OUT.\n<\/b>\n<b>                         THE END\n<\/b>\n\n\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Prom-Night.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Prom Night<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=William Gray\" title=\"Scripts by William Gray\">William Gray<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Bob Guza\" title=\"Scripts by Bob Guza\">Bob Guza<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Prom Night Script.html#comments\" title=\"Prom Night comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":180,"split":"train"}
