{"ori_id":"2148102315134288df1183ff805c8c29785f270c","title":"The Next Three Days","context":"The Next Three Days\n Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is convicted of murdering her boss and is sentenced to life in prison. The evidence seems impossible to dispute: many colleagues saw her having a quarrel with the victim, their cars are parked right next to each other, she is seen leaving the crime scene seconds before the body is discovered, the murder weapon (a fire extinguisher) has her fingerprints on it and she has the victim's blood on the back of her overcoat. Following the failure of her appeal, her son Luke ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits. One day, Lara attempts suicide, unwilling to spend the rest of her life in prison. Her husband John Brennan (Russell Crowe), a professor at a community college, becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her out of jail.\nJohn consults Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), a former convict who escaped prison seven times. Damon gives John advice, along with a warning that the initial escape will be easy compared to evading the police after that. Following Damon's advice, John begins his preparation. He obtains a handgun and fake IDs, and studies the map of Pittsburgh for escape routes. To get money, he sells their house's furniture and personal belongings. John attempts to break Lara out from the prison in which she is held but abandons the plan when he is almost caught testing a self-made \"bump key\" on an elevator.\nWhen John is told that Lara will be transferred in 72 hours to another prison facility, he is forced to come up with an emergency plan. Unable to get the money from his house in time, he considers robbing a bank, but hesitates at the last minute. Instead, John tails a local drug dealer to a drug lord, then robs him. Following clues left behind at the drug lord's house, the police track down John's car, get to his empty house and conclude that he is planning to break his wife out.\nJohn tears down the big map filled with notes and photos of his escape plan, and scatter the pieces. He leaves Luke at his classmate's birthday party, then plants falsified blood work indicating that Lara is in a state of hyperglycaemia. Lara is transferred to a nearby hospital, where John convinces her to escape with him.\nJohn and Lara leave the hospital, narrowly escaping the police and leave the city center. They then find out that Luke is at the zoo for the birthday party. John drives there to retrieve him, by which point the police have already established roadblocks on all interstate routes. Anticipating that police are looking for \"a couple and a child\", John improvises by picking up an elderly couple. They drive through the checkpoint without incident and proceed to Buffalo, New York, where John drops off the couple. The Brennans cross the border into Canada and head to an airport. Meanwhile, John's parents refuse to cooperate with the police. The police examine the escape plan fragments to figure out his destination, but are misled by the photos and delay the wrong flight.\nA detective returns to the crime scene where Lara's boss was killed. He remembers Lara saying a button popped off as the mugger bumped into her, and deduces that it must have fallen in the storm drain. He searches the storm drain but is unable to find the button. It turns out the button was there, buried under grime, and the detective just missed it. While the police haven't the evidence to exonerate Lara Brennan, the audience does, because a flashback reveals how her boss died at the hands of a mugger, and how Lara came to have the victim's blood on her coat, and her fingerprints on the murder weapon. At the end of the film, the family arrives at a hotel in Caracas, Venezuela. As Lara lies down next to him, Luke kisses his mother and falls asleep. John takes a picture of their sleeping faces as the movie ends.\n<html>\n<head><title>Next Three Days, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Next Three Days, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Next Three Days, The script, Next Three Days, The movie script, Next Three Days, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The\n    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The\n    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid\n    collision.

JOHN           \n    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a\n    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him\n    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He\n    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.\n    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears\n    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking\n    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking\n    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          \n    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of\n    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        \n    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                \n\n<b>                           LARA\n<\/b>               You know what?

HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         197\n<\/b>\n      John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner\n      where he noticed kids selling drugs.\n\n      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The\n      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an\n      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks\n      his watch and settles in to wait.\n\n<b>198   EXT.

John checks\n      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer\n      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the\n      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to\n      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.\n\n<b>199   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         199\n<\/b>\n      John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at\n      another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on;\n      John follows.\n\n<b>200   EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT                          200\n<\/b>\n      Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.\n      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.\n\n      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then\n      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many\n      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks\n      over the fences.\n\n      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a\n      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.\n      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and\n      the light goes out again.\n\n\n\n<b>                                               (CONTINUED)\n<\/b><b>       WHITE    9-10-09                                                68.\n<\/b>\n<b>200   CONTINUED:                                                            200\n<\/b>\n      John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges\n      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are\n      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he\n      came.\n\n      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the\n      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back\n      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside\n      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait\n      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.\n\n      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!\n\n<b>201   EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT                      201\n<\/b>\n      John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks\n      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize\n      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,\n      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is\n      no way he wouldn't see him.\n\n      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks\n      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.\n      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in\n      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.\n\n      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking\n      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!\n\n      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams\n      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --\n      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.\n\n<b>202   INT.
