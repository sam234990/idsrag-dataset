Mathilde Stangerson, the 30-something daughter of the castle's owner, Professor Joseph Stangerson, was found near-critically battered in a room adjacent to his laboratory on the castle grounds, with the door still locked from the inside. She recovers slowly but can make no useful testimony. Rouletabille meets and interrogates several characters: the castle's concierges Mr & Mrs Bernier, the old servant Jacques, an unfriendly inn landlord and a womanising gamekeeper, and begins a friendly rivalry with France's top police detective Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Larsan, who has been assigned the case. Larsan suspects Ms Stangerson's fianc\u00e9, another scientist called Robert Darzac, to Rouletabille's dismay.\nMore attempts are made on Ms Stangerson's life despite Rouletabille and Larsan's protection, and the perpetrator appears to vanish on two occasions when they are closing in on him, echoing Professor's Stangerson's research into \"matter dissociation\". The game-keeper is murdered during the second attempt. Ultimately, Larsan arrests Darzac who is charged with murder attempts. Rouletabille suspects that Darzac has secret reasons not to defend himself and he disappears to make further investigations.\nTwo-and-a-half months later, as Darzac's trial opens, Rouletabille reappears sensationally and tells the court that the culprit is Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Larsan himself, whom he accuses of being an alter-ego of a master criminal called Ballmeyer. Larsan appeared to vanish on the two occasions he was nearly collared as he was one of the pursuers. Darzac is released when it emerges that Larsan has vanished after Rouletabille warned him he would accuse him in court. The mystery of the locked Yellow Room is explained thus: Larsan assaulted Ms Stangerson earlier in the day than originally thought, but she hid the traces of the attack and locked herself. During the night, traumatised by the event, she fell off her bed and inflicted the gravest of the wounds by hitting her temple on the corner of her bed-side table.\nThe background to these events is kept secret in court but finally explained by Sainclair. Ballmeyer, in a different guise, had seduced Ms Stangerson in her youth and married her secretly in the United States. They had a child before he was arrested and his identity revealed to her. Ms Stangerson had arranged for her son's care and education and hidden the whole saga from her father; her silence and Robert Darzac's behaviour were motivated by her desperation to keep him from finding out. Ballmeyer however, hearing that she was engaged, had decided to reappear in her life and claim her as his wife once more, by force if necessary.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Mystery of the Yellow Room, by Gaston Leroux\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

In Which We Begin Not to Understand\n\n\nIt is not without a certain emotion that I begin to recount here the\nextraordinary adventures of Joseph Rouletabille. Down to the present\ntime he had so firmly opposed my doing it that I had come to despair of\never publishing the most curious of police stories of the past fifteen\nyears. I had even imagined that the public would never know the whole\ntruth of the prodigious case known as that of The Yellow Room, out of\nwhich grew so many mysterious, cruel, and sensational dramas, with which\nmy friend was so closely mixed up, if, propos of a recent nomination of\nthe illustrious Stangerson to the grade of grandcross of the Legion of\nHonour, an evening journal--in an article, miserable for its ignorance,\nor audacious for its perfidy--had not resuscitated a terrible adventure\nof which Joseph Rouletabille had told me he wished to be for ever\nforgotten.\n\nThe Yellow Room! Who now remembers this affair which caused so much ink\nto flow fifteen years ago? Events are so quickly forgotten in Paris.\nHas not the very name of the Nayves trial and the tragic history of the\ndeath of little Menaldo passed out of mind? And yet the public attention\nwas so deeply interested in the details of the trial that the occurrence\nof a ministerial crisis was completely unnoticed at the time. Now The\nYellow Room trial, which, preceded that of the Nayves by some years,\nmade far more noise. The entire world hung for months over this obscure\nproblem--the most obscure, it seems to me, that has ever challenged the\nperspicacity of our police or taxed the conscience of our judges. The\nsolution of the problem baffled everybody who tried to find it. It was\nlike a dramatic rebus with which old Europe and new America alike became\nfascinated. That is, in truth--I am permitted to say, because there\ncannot be any author's vanity in all this, since I do nothing more than\ntranscribe facts on which an exceptional documentation enables me to\nthrow a new light--that is because, in truth, I do not know that, in\nthe domain of reality or imagination, one can discover or recall to mind\nanything comparable, in its mystery, with the natural mystery of The\nYellow Room.\n\nThat which nobody could find out, Joseph Rouletabille, aged eighteen,\nthen a reporter engaged on a leading journal, succeeded in discovering.\nBut when, at the Assize Court, he brought in the key to the whole case,\nhe did not tell the whole truth. He only allowed so much of it to appear\nas sufficed to ensure the acquittal of an innocent man. The reasons\nwhich he had for his reticence no longer exist. Better still, the time\nhas come for my friend to speak out fully. You are going to know all;\nand, without further preamble, I am going to place before your eyes\nthe problem of The Yellow Room as it was placed before the eyes of the\nentire world on the day following the enactment of the drama at the\nChateau du Glandier.\n\nOn the 25th of October, 1892, the following note appeared in the latest\nedition of the \"Temps\":\n\n\"A frightful crime has been committed at the Glandier, on the border of\nthe forest of Sainte-Genevieve, above Epinay-sur-Orge, at the house of\nProfessor Stangerson. On that night, while the master was working in his\nlaboratory, an attempt was made to assassinate Mademoiselle Stangerson,\nwho was sleeping in a chamber adjoining this laboratory. The doctors do\nnot answer for the life of Mdlle. Stangerson.\"\n\nThe impression made on Paris by this news may be easily imagined.\nAlready, at that time, the learned world was deeply interested in the\nlabours of Professor Stangerson and his daughter. These labours--the\nfirst that were attempted in radiography--served to open the way for\nMonsieur and Madame Curie to the discovery of radium. It was expected\nthe Professor would shortly read to the Academy of Sciences a\nsensational paper on his new theory,--the Dissociation of Matter,--a\ntheory destined to overthrow from its base the whole of official\nscience, which based itself on the principle of the Conservation of\nEnergy. On the following day, the newspapers were full of the tragedy.\nThe \"Matin,\" among others, published the following article, entitled: \"A\nSupernatural Crime\":\n\n\"These are the only details,\" wrote the anonymous writer in the\n\"Matin\"--\"we have been able to obtain concerning the crime of the\nChateau du Glandier. The state of despair in which Professor Stangerson\nis plunged, and the impossibility of getting any information from\nthe lips of the victim, have rendered our investigations and those of\njustice so difficult that, at present, we cannot form the least idea of\nwhat has passed in The Yellow Room in which Mdlle. Stangerson, in her\nnight-dress, was found lying on the floor in the agonies of death. We\nhave, at least, been able to interview Daddy Jacques--as he is called\nin the country--a old servant in the Stangerson family. Daddy Jacques\nentered The Room at the same time as the Professor. This chamber adjoins\nthe laboratory. Laboratory and Yellow Room are in a pavilion at the\nend of the park, about three hundred metres (a thousand feet) from the\nchateau.\n\n\"'It was half-past twelve at night,' this honest old man told us, 'and I\nwas in the laboratory, where Monsieur Stangerson was still working, when\nthe thing happened. I had been cleaning and putting instruments in order\nall the evening and was waiting for Monsieur Stangerson to go to bed.\nMademoiselle Stangerson had worked with her father up to midnight; when\nthe twelve strokes of midnight had sounded by the cuckoo-clock in\nthe laboratory, she rose, kissed Monsieur Stangerson and bade him\ngood-night. To me she said \"bon soir, Daddy Jacques\" as she passed into\nThe Yellow Room. We heard her lock the door and shoot the bolt, so that\nI could not help laughing, and said to Monsieur: \"There's Mademoiselle\ndouble-locking herself in,--she must be afraid of the 'Bete du bon\nDieu!'\" Monsieur did not even hear me, he was so deeply absorbed in what\nhe was doing. Just then we heard the distant miawing of a cat. \"Is that\ngoing to keep us awake all night?\" I said to myself; for I must tell\nyou, Monsieur, that, to the end of October, I live in an attic of the\npavilion over The Yellow Room, so that Mademoiselle should not be\nleft alone through the night in the lonely park. It was the fancy of\nMademoiselle to spend the fine weather in the pavilion; no doubt, she\nfound it more cheerful than the chateau and, for the four years it had\nbeen built, she had never failed to take up her lodging there in the\nspring. With the return of winter, Mademoiselle returns to the chateau,\nfor there is no fireplace in The Yellow Room.\n\n\"'We were staying in the pavilion, then--Monsieur Stangerson and me. We\nmade no noise. He was seated at his desk. As for me, I was sitting on\na chair, having finished my work and, looking at him, I said to myself:\n\"What a man!--what intelligence!--what knowledge!\" I attach importance\nto the fact that we made no noise; for, because of that, the assassin\ncertainly thought that we had left the place. And, suddenly, while the\ncuckoo was sounding the half after midnight, a desperate clamour\nbroke out in The Yellow Room. It was the voice of Mademoiselle, crying\n\"Murder!--murder!--help!\" Immediately afterwards revolver shots rang out\nand there was a great noise of tables and furniture being thrown to\nthe ground, as if in the course of a struggle, and again the voice of\nMademoiselle calling, \"Murder!--help!--Papa!--Papa!--\"\n\n\"'You may be sure that we quickly sprang up and that Monsieur Stangerson\nand I threw ourselves upon the door. But alas! it was locked, fast\nlocked, on the inside, by the care of Mademoiselle, as I have told you,\nwith key and bolt. We tried to force it open, but it remained firm.\nMonsieur Stangerson was like a madman, and truly, it was enough to make\nhim one, for we heard Mademoiselle still calling \"Help!--help!\" Monsieur\nStangerson showered terrible blows on the door, and wept with rage and\nsobbed with despair and helplessness.\n\n\"'It was then that I had an inspiration. \"The assassin must have entered\nby the window!\" I cried;--\"I will go to the window!\" and I rushed from\nthe pavilion and ran like one out of his mind.\n\n\"'The inspiration was that the window of The Yellow Room looks out in\nsuch a way that the park wall, which abuts on the pavilion, prevented my\nat once reaching the window. To get up to it one has first to go out\nof the park. I ran towards the gate and, on my way, met Bernier and his\nwife, the gate-keepers, who had been attracted by the pistol reports and\nby our cries. In a few words I told them what had happened, and directed\nthe concierge to join Monsieur Stangerson with all speed, while his wife\ncame with me to open the park gate. Five minutes later she and I were\nbefore the window of The Yellow Room.\n\n\"'The moon was shining brightly and I saw clearly that no one had\ntouched the window. Not only were the bars that protect it intact, but\nthe blinds inside of them were drawn, as I had myself drawn them early\nin the evening, as I did every day, though Mademoiselle, knowing that\nI was tired from the heavy work I had been doing, had begged me not to\ntrouble myself, but leave her to do it; and they were just as I had\nleft them, fastened with an iron catch on the inside. The assassin,\ntherefore, could not have passed either in or out that way; but neither\ncould I get in.\n\n\"'It was unfortunate,--enough to turn one's brain! The door of the room\nlocked on the inside and the blinds on the only window also fastened on\nthe inside; and Mademoiselle still calling for help!--No! she had ceased\nto call. She was dead, perhaps. But I still heard her father, in the\npavilion, trying to break down the door.\n\n\"'With the concierge I hurried back to the pavilion. The door, in spite\nof the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst\nit open, was still holding firm; but at length, it gave way before our\nunited efforts,--and then what a sight met our eyes! I should tell you\nthat, behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lamp--a powerful\nlamp, that lit the whole chamber.\n\n\"'I must also tell you, monsieur, that The Yellow Room is a very small\nroom. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead,\na small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table, and two chairs. By\nthe light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in\nher night-dress, was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest\ndisorder. Tables and chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had\nbeen a violent struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged\nfrom her bed. She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of\nfinger-nails on her throat,--the flesh of her neck having been almost\ntorn by the nails. From a wound on the right temple a stream of\nblood had run down and made a little pool on the floor. When Monsieur\nStangerson saw his daughter in that state, he threw himself on his knees\nbeside her, uttering a cry of despair. He ascertained that she still\nbreathed. As to us, we searched for the wretch who had tried to kill our\nmistress, and I swear to you, monsieur, that, if we had found him, it\nwould have gone hard with him!\n\n\"'But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already escaped?\nIt passes all imagination!--Nobody under the bed, nobody behind the\nfurniture!--All that we discovered were traces, blood-stained marks of\na man's large hand on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red\nwith blood, without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks\nof a man on the floor,--footmarks of a man with large feet whose\nboot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got\naway? How had he vanished? Don't forget, monsieur, that there is no\nchimney in The Yellow Room. He could not have escaped by the door, which\nis narrow, and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the\nlamp, while her husband and I searched for him in every corner of the\nlittle room, where it is impossible for anyone to hide himself. The\ndoor, which had been forced open against the wall, could not conceal\nanything behind it, as we assured ourselves. By the window, still in\nevery way secured, no flight had been possible. What then?--I began to\nbelieve in the Devil.\n\n\"'But we discovered my revolver on the floor!--Yes, my revolver! Oh!\nthat brought me back to the reality! The Devil would not have needed to\nsteal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had\nfirst gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where\nI kept it. We then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the\nassassin had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur\nStangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen\nwith his own eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this\nbusiness of my revolver, I don't know where we should have been,--I\nshould now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to\nthe scaffold!'\"\n\nThe editor of the \"Matin\" added to this interview the following lines:\n\n\"We have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to recount\nto us roughly all he knows about the crime of The Yellow Room. We have\nreproduced it in his own words, only sparing the reader the continual\nlamentations with which he garnished his narrative. It is quite\nunderstood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of\nyour masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating\nit--especially since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right,\nand we see no harm in it. We should have liked to put some further\nquestions to Daddy Jacques--Jacques--Louis Moustier--but the inquiry\nof the examining magistrate, which is being carried on at the chateau,\nmakes it impossible for us to gain admission at the Glandier; and, as\nto the oak wood, it is guarded by a wide circle of policemen, who are\njealously watching all traces that can lead to the pavilion, and that\nmay perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. \"We have also wished\nto question the concierges, but they are invisible. Finally, we have\nwaited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the chateau, for\nthe departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of Corbeil. At\nhalf-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was able to enter\nhis carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the following question:\n\n\"'Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to this\naffair, without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?'\n\n\"'It is impossible for us to do it,' replied Monsieur de Marquet. 'I can\nonly say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we\nthink we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!'\n\n\"We asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last\nwords; and this is what he said,--the importance of which no one will\nfail to recognise:\n\n\"'If nothing is added to the material facts so far established, I\nfear that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which\nMademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to\nlight; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human reason, that\nthe examination of the walls, and of the ceiling of The Yellow\nRoom--an examination which I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who\nconstructed the pavilion four years ago--will afford us the proof that\nmay not discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way the\nassassin gained admission,--he entered by the door and hid himself under\nthe bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did\nhe escape? If no trap, no secret door, no hiding place, no opening\nof any sort is found; if the examination of the walls--even to the\ndemolition of the pavilion--does not reveal any passage practicable--not\nonly for a human being, but for any being whatsoever--if the ceiling\nshows no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must\nreally believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!'\"\n\nAnd the anonymous writer in the \"Matin\" added in this article--which I\nhave selected as the most interesting of all those that were published\non the subject of this affair--that the examining magistrate appeared\nto place a peculiar significance to the last sentence: \"One must really\nbelieve in the Devil, as Jacques says.\"\n\nThe article concluded with these lines: \"We wanted to know what Daddy\nJacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu.\" The landlord of the\nDonjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry\nwhich is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman,--Mother\nAngenoux, as she is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of\nsaint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the\ngrotto of Sainte-Genevieve.\n\n\"The Yellow Room, the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the Devil,\nSainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,--here is a well entangled crime which\nthe stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us to-morrow.\nLet us at least hope that, for the sake of our human reason, as the\nexamining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle\nStangerson--who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces\none word distinctly, 'Murderer! Murderer!'--will not live through the\nnight.\"\n\nIn conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced that the\nChief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective, Frederic\nLarsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities,\nto return immediately to Paris.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears for the First Time\n\n\nI remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry of young\nRouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about eight o'clock\nand I was still in bed reading the article in the \"Matin\" relative to\nthe Glandier crime.\n\nBut, before going further, it is time that I present my friend to the\nreader.\n\nI first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that\ntime I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of\nexamining magistrates, when I had gone to get a \"permit to communicate\"\nfor the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, \"a\ngood nut.\" He seemed to have taken his head--round as a bullet--out of\na box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of\nthe press--all determined billiard-players--had given him that nickname,\nwhich was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always\nas red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while\nstill so young--he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him\nfor the first time--had he already won his way on the press? That was\nwhat everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if they\nhad not known his history. At the time of the affair of the woman cut in\npieces in the Rue Oberskampf--another forgotten story--he had taken to\none of the editors of the \"Epoque,\"--a paper then rivalling the \"Matin\"\nfor information,--the left foot, which was missing from the basket\nin which the gruesome remains were discovered. For this left foot the\npolice had been vainly searching for a week, and young Rouletabille had\nfound it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking for it. To\ndo that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a number\nengaged by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an overflow\nof the Seine.\n\nWhen the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot and\ninformed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been\nled to make, he was divided between the admiration he felt for such\ndetective cunning in a brain of a lad of sixteen years, and delight at\nbeing able to exhibit, in the \"morgue window\" of his paper, the left\nfoot of the Rue Oberskampf.\n\n\"This foot,\" he cried, \"will make a great headline.\"\n\nThen, when he had confided the gruesome packet to the medical lawyer\nattached to the journal, he asked the lad, who was shortly to become\nfamous as Rouletabille, what he would expect to earn as a general\nreporter on the \"Epoque\"?\n\n\"Two hundred francs a month,\" the youngster replied modestly, hardly\nable to breathe from surprise at the proposal.\n\n\"You shall have two hundred and fifty,\" said the editor-in-chief; \"only\nyou must tell everybody that you have been engaged on the paper for a\nmonth. Let it be quite understood that it was not you but the 'Epoque'\nthat discovered the left foot of the Rue Oberskampf. Here, my young\nfriend, the man is nothing, the paper everything.\"\n\nHaving said this, he begged the new reporter to retire, but before the\nyouth had reached the door he called him back to ask his name. The other\nreplied:\n\n\"Joseph Josephine.\"\n\n\"That's not a name,\" said the editor-in-chief, \"but since you will not\nbe required to sign what you write it is of no consequence.\"\n\nThe boy-faced reporter speedily made himself many friends, for he\nwas serviceable and gifted with a good humour that enchanted the most\nsevere-tempered and disarmed the most zealous of his companions. At\nthe Bar cafe, where the reporters assembled before going to any of the\ncourts, or to the Prefecture, in search of their news of crime, he began\nto win a reputation as an unraveller of intricate and obscure affairs\nwhich found its way to the office of the Chief of the Surete. When a\ncase was worth the trouble and Rouletabille--he had already been given\nhis nickname--had been started on the scent by his editor-in-chief, he\noften got the better of the most famous detective.\n\nIt was at the Bar cafe that I became intimately acquainted with him.\nCriminal lawyers and journalists are not enemies, the former need\nadvertisement, the latter information. We chatted together, and I soon\nwarmed towards him. His intelligence was so keen, and so original!--and\nhe had a quality of thought such as I have never found in any other\nperson.\n\nSome time after this I was put in charge of the law news of the \"Cri du\nBoulevard.\" My entry into journalism could not but strengthen the ties\nwhich united me to Rouletabille. After a while, my new friend being\nallowed to carry out an idea of a judicial correspondence column, which\nhe was allowed to sign \"Business,\" in the \"Epoque,\" I was often able to\nfurnish him with the legal information of which he stood in need.\n\nNearly two years passed in this way, and the better I knew him, the more\nI learned to love him; for, in spite of his careless extravagance, I\nhad discovered in him what was, considering his age, an extraordinary\nseriousness of mind. Accustomed as I was to seeing him gay and, indeed,\noften too gay, I would many times find him plunged in the deepest\nmelancholy. I tried then to question him as to the cause of this change\nof humour, but each time he laughed and made me no answer. One day,\nhaving questioned him about his parents, of whom he never spoke, he left\nme, pretending not to have heard what I said.\n\nWhile things were in this state between us, the famous case of The\nYellow Room took place. It was this case which was to rank him as the\nleading newspaper reporter, and to obtain for him the reputation of\nbeing the greatest detective in the world. It should not surprise us to\nfind in the one man the perfection of two such lines of activity if we\nremember that the daily press was already beginning to transform itself\nand to become what it is to-day--the gazette of crime.\n\nMorose-minded people may complain of this; for myself I regard it a\nmatter for congratulation. We can never have too many arms, public or\nprivate, against the criminal. To this some people may answer that,\nby continually publishing the details of crimes, the press ends by\nencouraging their commission. But then, with some people we can never do\nright. Rouletabille, as I have said, entered my room that morning of the\n26th of October, 1892. He was looking redder than usual, and his eyes\nwere bulging out of his head, as the phrase is, and altogether he\nappeared to be in a state of extreme excitement. He waved the \"Matin\"\nwith a trembling hand, and cried:\n\n\"Well, my dear Sainclair,--have you read it?\"\n\n\"The Glandier crime?\"\n\n\"Yes; The Yellow Room!--What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think that it must have been the Devil or the Bete du Bon Dieu that\ncommitted the crime.\"\n\n\"Be serious!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't much believe in murderers* who make their escape through\nwalls of solid brick. I think Daddy Jacques did wrong to leave behind\nhim the weapon with which the crime was committed and, as he occupied\nthe attic immediately above Mademoiselle Stangerson's room, the\nbuilder's job ordered by the examining magistrate will give us the key\nof the enigma and it will not be long before we learn by what natural\ntrap, or by what secret door, the old fellow was able to slip in and\nout, and return immediately to the laboratory to Monsieur Stangerson,\nwithout his absence being noticed. That, of course, is only an\nhypothesis.\"\n\n   *Although the original English translation often uses the words\n   \"murder\" and \"murderer,\" the reader may substitute \"attack\" and\n   \"attacker\" since no murder is actually committed.\n\nRouletabille sat down in an armchair, lit his pipe, which he was never\nwithout, smoked for a few minutes in silence--no doubt to calm the\nexcitement which, visibly, dominated him--and then replied:\n\n\"Young man,\" he said, in a tone the sad irony of which I will not\nattempt to render, \"young man, you are a lawyer and I doubt not your\nability to save the guilty from conviction; but if you were a magistrate\non the bench, how easy it would be for you to condemn innocent\npersons!--You are really gifted, young man!\"\n\nHe continued to smoke energetically, and then went on:\n\n\"No trap will be found, and the mystery of The Yellow Room will become\nmore and more mysterious. That's why it interests me. The examining\nmagistrate is right; nothing stranger than this crime has ever been\nknown.\"\n\n\"Have you any idea of the way by which the murderer escaped?\" I asked.\n\n\"None,\" replied Rouletabille--\"none, for the present. But I have an idea\nas to the revolver; the murderer did not use it.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens! By whom, then, was it used?\"\n\n\"Why--by Mademoiselle Stangerson.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,--or rather, I have never understood,\" I said.\n\nRouletabille shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Is there nothing in this article in the 'Matin' by which you were\nparticularly struck?\"\n\n\"Nothing,--I have found the whole of the story it tells equally\nstrange.\"\n\n\"Well, but--the locked door--with the key on the inside?\"\n\n\"That's the only perfectly natural thing in the whole article.\"\n\n\"Really!--And the bolt?\"\n\n\"The bolt?\"\n\n\"Yes, the bolt--also inside the room--a still further protection against\nentry? Mademoiselle Stangerson took quite extraordinary precautions!\nIt is clear to me that she feared someone. That was why she took such\nprecautions--even Daddy Jacques's revolver--without telling him of it.\nNo doubt she didn't wish to alarm anybody, and least of all, her father.\nWhat she dreaded took place, and she defended herself. There was a\nstruggle, and she used the revolver skilfully enough to wound the\nassassin in the hand--which explains the impression on the wall and on\nthe door of the large, blood-stained hand of the man who was searching\nfor a means of exit from the chamber. But she didn't fire soon enough to\navoid the terrible blow on the right temple.\"\n\n\"Then the wound on the temple was not done with the revolver?\"\n\n\"The paper doesn't say it was, and I don't think it was; because\nlogically it appears to me that the revolver was used by Mademoiselle\nStangerson against the assassin. Now, what weapon did the murderer use?\nThe blow on the temple seems to show that the murderer wished to stun\nMademoiselle Stangerson,--after he had unsuccessfully tried to strangle\nher. He must have known that the attic was inhabited by Daddy Jacques,\nand that was one of the reasons, I think, why he must have used a quiet\nweapon,--a life-preserver, or a hammer.\"\n\n\"All that doesn't explain how the murderer got out of The Yellow Room,\"\nI observed.\n\n\"Evidently,\" replied Rouletabille, rising, \"and that is what has to be\nexplained. I am going to the Chateau du Glandier, and have come to see\nwhether you will go with me.\"\n\n\"I?--\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy. I want you. The 'Epoque' has definitely entrusted this\ncase to me, and I must clear it up as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"But in what way can I be of any use to you?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Robert Darzac is at the Chateau du Glandier.\"\n\n\"That's true. His despair must be boundless.\"\n\n\"I must have a talk with him.\"\n\nRouletabille said it in a tone that surprised me.\n\n\"Is it because--you think there is something to be got out of him?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThat was all he would say. He retired to my sitting-room, begging me to\ndress quickly.\n\nI knew Monsieur Robert Darzac from having been of great service to him\nin a civil action, while I was acting as secretary to Maitre Barbet\nDelatour. Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was at that time about forty years\nof age, was a professor of physics at the Sorbonne. He was intimately\nacquainted with the Stangersons, and, after an assiduous seven years'\ncourtship of the daughter, had been on the point of marrying her. In\nspite of the fact that she has become, as the phrase goes, \"a person\nof a certain age,\" she was still remarkably good-looking. While I was\ndressing I called out to Rouletabille, who was impatiently moving about\nmy sitting-room:\n\n\"Have you any idea as to the murderer's station in life?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"I think if he isn't a man in society, he is, at\nleast, a man belonging to the upper class. But that, again, is only an\nimpression.\"\n\n\"What has led you to form it?\"\n\n\"Well,--the greasy cap, the common handkerchief, and the marks of the\nrough boots on the floor,\" he replied.\n\n\"I understand,\" I said; \"murderers don't leave traces behind them which\ntell the truth.\"\n\n\"We shall make something out of you yet, my dear Sainclair,\" concluded\nRouletabille.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. \"A Man Has Passed Like a Shadow Through the Blinds\"\n\n\nHalf an hour later Rouletabille and I were on the platform of the\nOrleans station, awaiting the departure of the train which was to take\nus to Epinay-sur-Orge.\n\nOn the platform we found Monsieur de Marquet and his Registrar, who\nrepresented the Judicial Court of Corbeil. Monsieur Marquet had spent\nthe night in Paris, attending the final rehearsal, at the Scala, of a\nlittle play of which he was the unknown author, signing himself simply\n\"Castigat Ridendo.\"\n\nMonsieur de Marquet was beginning to be a \"noble old gentleman.\"\nGenerally he was extremely polite and full of gay humour, and in all\nhis life had had but one passion,--that of dramatic art. Throughout\nhis magisterial career he was interested solely in cases capable of\nfurnishing him with something in the nature of a drama. Though he might\nvery well have aspired to the highest judicial positions, he had\nnever really worked for anything but to win a success at the romantic\nPorte-Saint-Martin, or at the sombre Odeon.\n\nBecause of the mystery which shrouded it, the case of The Yellow\nRoom was certain to fascinate so theatrical a mind. It interested him\nenormously, and he threw himself into it, less as a magistrate eager\nto know the truth, than as an amateur of dramatic embroglios, tending\nwholly to mystery and intrigue, who dreads nothing so much as the\nexplanatory final act.\n\nSo that, at the moment of meeting him, I heard Monsieur de Marquet say\nto the Registrar with a sigh:\n\n\"I hope, my dear Monsieur Maleine, this builder with his pickaxe will\nnot destroy so fine a mystery.\"\n\n\"Have no fear,\" replied Monsieur Maleine, \"his pickaxe may demolish the\npavilion, perhaps, but it will leave our case intact. I have sounded the\nwalls and examined the ceiling and floor and I know all about it. I am\nnot to be deceived.\"\n\nHaving thus reassured his chief, Monsieur Maleine, with a discreet\nmovement of the head, drew Monsieur de Marquet's attention to us. The\nface of that gentleman clouded, and, as he saw Rouletabille approaching,\nhat in hand, he sprang into one of the empty carriages saying, half\naloud to his Registrar, as he did so, \"Above all, no journalists!\"\n\nMonsieur Maleine replied in the same tone, \"I understand!\" and then\ntried to prevent Rouletabille from entering the same compartment with\nthe examining magistrate.\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen,--this compartment is reserved.\"\n\n\"I am a journalist, Monsieur, engaged on the 'Epoque,'\" said my young\nfriend with a great show of gesture and politeness, \"and I have a word\nor two to say to Monsieur de Marquet.\"\n\n\"Monsieur is very much engaged with the inquiry he has in hand.\"\n\n\"Ah! his inquiry, pray believe me, is absolutely a matter of\nindifference to me. I am no scavenger of odds and ends,\" he went on,\nwith infinite contempt in his lower lip, \"I am a theatrical reporter;\nand this evening I shall have to give a little account of the play at\nthe Scala.\"\n\n\"Get in, sir, please,\" said the Registrar.\n\nRouletabille was already in the compartment. I went in after him\nand seated myself by his side. The Registrar followed and closed the\ncarriage door.\n\nMonsieur de Marquet looked at him.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" Rouletabille began, \"You must not be angry with Monsieur de\nMaleine. It is not with Monsieur de Marquet that I desire to have the\nhonour of speaking, but with Monsieur 'Castigat Ridendo.' Permit me to\ncongratulate you--personally, as well as the writer for the 'Epoque.'\"\nAnd Rouletabille, having first introduced me, introduced himself.\n\nMonsieur de Marquet, with a nervous gesture, caressed his beard into a\npoint, and explained to Rouletabille, in a few words, that he was too\nmodest an author to desire that the veil of his pseudonym should be\npublicly raised, and that he hoped the enthusiasm of the journalist for\nthe dramatist's work would not lead him to tell the public that Monsieur\n\"Castigat Ridendo\" and the examining magistrate of Corbeil were one and\nthe same person.\n\n\"The work of the dramatic author may interfere,\" he said, after a slight\nhesitation, \"with that of the magistrate, especially in a province where\none's labours are little more than routine.\"\n\n\"Oh, you may rely on my discretion!\" cried Rouletabille.\n\nThe train was in motion.\n\n\"We have started!\" said the examining magistrate, surprised at seeing us\nstill in the carriage.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur,--truth has started,\" said Rouletabile, smiling\namiably,--\"on its way to the Chateau du Glandier. A fine case, Monsieur\nde Marquet,--a fine case!\"\n\n\"An obscure--incredible, unfathomable, inexplicable affair--and there is\nonly one thing I fear, Monsieur Rouletabille,--that the journalists will\nbe trying to explain it.\"\n\nMy friend felt this a rap on his knuckles.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said simply, \"that is to be feared. They meddle in everything.\nAs for my interest, monsieur, I only referred to it by mere chance,--the\nmere chance of finding myself in the same train with you, and in the\nsame compartment of the same carriage.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, then?\" asked Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"To the Chateau du Glandier,\" replied Rouletabille, without turning.\n\n\"You'll not get in, Monsieur Rouletabille!\"\n\n\"Will you prevent me?\" said my friend, already prepared to fight.\n\n\"Not I!--I like the press and journalists too well to be in any way\ndisagreeable to them; but Monsieur Stangerson has given orders for\nhis door to be closed against everybody, and it is well guarded. Not a\njournalist was able to pass through the gate of the Glandier yesterday.\"\n\nMonsieur de Marquet compressed his lips and seemed ready to relapse into\nobstinate silence. He only relaxed a little when Rouletabille no longer\nleft him in ignorance of the fact that we were going to the Glandier for\nthe purpose of shaking hands with an \"old and intimate friend,\" Monsieur\nRobert Darzac--a man whom Rouletabille had perhaps seen once in his\nlife.\n\n\"Poor Robert!\" continued the young reporter, \"this dreadful affair may\nbe his death,--he is so deeply in love with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\"\n\n\"His sufferings are truly painful to witness,\" escaped like a regret\nfrom the lips of Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"But it is to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson's life will be\nsaved.\"\n\n\"Let us hope so. Her father told me yesterday that, if she does not\nrecover, it will not be long before he joins her in the grave. What an\nincalculable loss to science his death would be!\"\n\n\"The wound on her temple is serious, is it not?\"\n\n\"Evidently; but, by a wonderful chance, it has not proved mortal. The\nblow was given with great force.\"\n\n\"Then it was not with the revolver she was wounded,\" said Rouletabille,\nglancing at me in triumph.\n\nMonsieur de Marquet appeared greatly embarrassed.\n\n\"I didn't say anything--I don't want to say anything--I will not say\nanything,\" he said. And he turned towards his Registrar as if he no\nlonger knew us.\n\nBut Rouletabille was not to be so easily shaken off. He moved nearer\nto the examining magistrate and, drawing a copy of the \"Matin\" from his\npocket, he showed it to him and said:\n\n\"There is one thing, Monsieur, which I may enquire of you without\ncommitting an indiscretion. You have, of course, seen the account given\nin the 'Matin'? It is absurd, is it not?\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"What! The Yellow Room has but one barred window--the bars of which have\nnot been moved--and only one door, which had to be broken open--and the\nassassin was not found!\"\n\n\"That's so, monsieur,--that's so. That's how the matter stands.\"\n\nRouletabille said no more but plunged into thought. A quarter of an hour\nthus passed.\n\nComing back to himself again he said, addressing the magistrate:\n\n\"How did Mademoiselle Stangerson wear her hair on that evening?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"That's a very important point,\" said Rouletabille. \"Her hair was done\nup in bands, wasn't it? I feel sure that on that evening, the evening of\nthe crime, she had her hair arranged in bands.\"\n\n\"Then you are mistaken, Monsieur Rouletabille,\" replied the magistrate;\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson that evening had her hair drawn up in a knot\non the top of her head,--her usual way of arranging it--her forehead\ncompletely uncovered. I can assure you, for we have carefully examined\nthe wound. There was no blood on the hair, and the arrangement of it has\nnot been disturbed since the crime was committed.\"\n\n\"You are sure! You are sure that, on the night of the crime, she had not\nher hair in bands?\"\n\n\"Quite sure,\" the magistrate continued, smiling, \"because I remember the\nDoctor saying to me, while he was examining the wound, 'It is a great\npity Mademoiselle Stangerson was in the habit of drawing her hair back\nfrom her forehead. If she had worn it in bands, the blow she received\non the temple would have been weakened.' It seems strange to me that you\nshould attach so much importance to this point.\"\n\n\"Oh! if she had not her hair in bands, I give it up,\" said Rouletabille,\nwith a despairing gesture.\n\n\"And was the wound on her temple a bad one?\" he asked presently.\n\n\"Terrible.\"\n\n\"With what weapon was it made?\"\n\n\"That is a secret of the investigation.\"\n\n\"Have you found the weapon--whatever it was?\"\n\nThe magistrate did not answer.\n\n\"And the wound in the throat?\"\n\nHere the examining magistrate readily confirmed the decision of the\ndoctor that, if the murderer had pressed her throat a few seconds\nlonger, Mademoiselle Stangerson would have died of strangulation.\n\n\"The affair as reported in the 'Matin,'\" said Rouletabille eagerly,\n\"seems to me more and more inexplicable. Can you tell me, Monsieur, how\nmany openings there are in the pavilion? I mean doors and windows.\"\n\n\"There are five,\" replied Monsieur de Marquet, after having coughed\nonce or twice, but no longer resisting the desire he felt to talk of\nthe whole of the incredible mystery of the affair he was investigating.\n\"There are five, of which the door of the vestibule is the only entrance\nto the pavilion,--a door always automatically closed, which cannot be\nopened, either from the outer or inside, except with the two special\nkeys which are never out of the possession of either Daddy Jacques or\nMonsieur Stangerson. Mademoiselle Stangerson had no need for one, since\nDaddy Jacques lodged in the pavilion and because, during the daytime,\nshe never left her father. When they, all four, rushed into The Yellow\nRoom, after breaking open the door of the laboratory, the door in the\nvestibule remained closed as usual and, of the two keys for opening it,\nDaddy Jacques had one in his pocket, and Monsieur Stangerson the other.\nAs to the windows of the pavilion, there are four; the one window of The\nYellow Room and those of the laboratory looking out on to the country;\nthe window in the vestibule looking into the park.\"\n\n\"It is by that window that he escaped from the pavilion!\" cried\nRouletabille.\n\n\"How do you know that?\" demanded Monsieur de Marquet, fixing a strange\nlook on my young friend.\n\n\"We'll see later how he got away from The Yellow Room,\" replied\nRouletabille, \"but he must have left the pavilion by the vestibule\nwindow.\"\n\n\"Once more,--how do you know that?\"\n\n\"How? Oh, the thing is simple enough! As soon as he found he could not\nescape by the door of the pavilion his only way out was by the window in\nthe vestibule, unless he could pass through a grated window. The window\nof The Yellow Room is secured by iron bars, because it looks out upon\nthe open country; the two windows of the laboratory have to be protected\nin like manner for the same reason. As the murderer got away, I conceive\nthat he found a window that was not barred,--that of the vestibule,\nwhich opens on to the park,--that is to say, into the interior of the\nestate. There's not much magic in all that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monsieur de Marquet, \"but what you have not guessed is that\nthis single window in the vestibule, though it has no iron bars, has\nsolid iron blinds. Now these iron blinds have remained fastened by their\niron latch; and yet we have proof that the murderer made his escape from\nthe pavilion by that window! Traces of blood on the inside wall and on\nthe blinds as well as on the floor, and footmarks, of which I have taken\nthe measurements, attest the fact that the murderer made his escape\nthat way. But then, how did he do it, seeing that the blinds remained\nfastened on the inside? He passed through them like a shadow. But what\nis more bewildering than all is that it is impossible to form any idea\nas to how the murderer got out of The Yellow Room, or how he got across\nthe laboratory to reach the vestibule! Ah, yes, Monsieur Rouletabille,\nit is altogether as you said, a fine case, the key to which will not be\ndiscovered for a long time, I hope.\"\n\n\"You hope, Monsieur?\"\n\nMonsieur de Marquet corrected himself.\n\n\"I do not hope so,--I think so.\"\n\n\"Could that window have been closed and refastened after the flight of\nthe assassin?\" asked Rouletabille.\n\n\"That is what occurred to me for a moment; but it would imply an\naccomplice or accomplices,--and I don't see--\"\n\nAfter a short silence he added:\n\n\"Ah--if Mademoiselle Stangerson were only well enough to-day to be\nquestioned!\"\n\nRouletabille following up his thought, asked:\n\n\"And the attic?--There must be some opening to that?\"\n\n\"Yes; there is a window, or rather skylight, in it, which, as it looks\nout towards the country, Monsieur Stangerson has had barred, like the\nrest of the windows. These bars, as in the other windows, have remained\nintact, and the blinds, which naturally open inwards, have not been\nunfastened. For the rest, we have not discovered anything to lead us to\nsuspect that the murderer had passed through the attic.\"\n\n\"It seems clear to you, then, Monsieur, that the murderer\nescaped--nobody knows how--by the window in the vestibule?\"\n\n\"Everything goes to prove it.\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" confessed Rouletabille gravely.\n\nAfter a brief silence, he continued:\n\n\"If you have not found any traces of the murderer in the attic, such as\nthe dirty footmarks similar to those on the floor of The Yellow Room,\nyou must come to the conclusion that it was not he who stole Daddy\nJacques's revolver.\"\n\n\"There are no footmarks in the attic other than those of Daddy Jacques\nhimself,\" said the magistrate with a significant turn of his head. Then,\nafter an apparent decision, he added: \"Daddy Jacques was with Monsieur\nStangerson in the laboratory--and it was lucky for him he was.\"\n\n\"Then what part did his revolver play in the tragedy?--It seems very\nclear that this weapon did less harm to Mademoiselle Stangerson than it\ndid to the murderer.\"\n\nThe magistrate made no reply to this question, which doubtless\nembarrassed him. \"Monsieur Stangerson,\" he said, \"tells us that the two\nbullets have been found in The Yellow Room, one embedded in the wall\nstained with the impression of a red hand--a man's large hand--and the\nother in the ceiling.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! in the ceiling!\" muttered Rouletabille. \"In the ceiling! That's\nvery curious!--In the ceiling!\"\n\nHe puffed awhile in silence at his pipe, enveloping himself in the\nsmoke. When we reached Savigny-sur-Orge, I had to tap him on the\nshoulder to arouse him from his dream and come out on to the platform of\nthe station.\n\nThere, the magistrate and his Registrar bowed to us, and by rapidly\ngetting into a cab that was awaiting them, made us understand that they\nhad seen enough of us.\n\n\"How long will it take to walk to the Chateau du Glandier?\" Rouletabille\nasked one of the railway porters.\n\n\"An hour and a half or an hour and three quarters--easy walking,\" the\nman replied.\n\nRouletabille looked up at the sky and, no doubt, finding its appearance\nsatisfactory, took my arm and said:\n\n\"Come on!--I need a walk.\"\n\n\"Are things getting less entangled?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" he said, \"more entangled than ever! It's true, I have\nan idea--\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked.\n\n\"I can't tell you what it is just at present--it's an idea involving the\nlife or death of two persons at least.\"\n\n\"Do you think there were accomplices?\"\n\n\"I don't think it--\"\n\nWe fell into silence. Presently he went on:\n\n\"It was a bit of luck, our falling in with that examining magistrate and\nhis Registrar, eh? What did I tell you about that revolver?\" His head\nwas bent down, he had his hands in his pockets, and he was whistling.\nAfter a while I heard him murmur:\n\n\"Poor woman!\"\n\n\"Is it Mademoiselle Stangerson you are pitying?\"\n\n\"Yes; she's a noble woman and worthy of being pitied!--a woman of a\ngreat, a very great character--I imagine--I imagine.\"\n\n\"You know her then?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I have never seen her.\"\n\n\"Why, then, do you say that she is a woman of great character?\"\n\n\"Because she bravely faced the murderer; because she courageously\ndefended herself--and, above all, because of the bullet in the ceiling.\"\n\nI looked at Rouletabille and inwardly wondered whether he was not\nmocking me, or whether he had not suddenly gone out of his senses. But I\nsaw that he had never been less inclined to laugh, and the brightness of\nhis keenly intelligent eyes assured me that he retained all his reason.\nThen, too, I was used to his broken way of talking, which only left me\npuzzled as to his meaning, till, with a very few clear, rapidly uttered\nwords, he would make the drift of his ideas clear to me, and I saw\nthat what he had previously said, and which had appeared to me void of\nmeaning, was so thoroughly logical that I could not understand how it\nwas I had not understood him sooner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. \"In the Bosom of Wild Nature\"\n\n\nThe Chateau du Glandier is one of the oldest chateaux in the Ile de\nFrance, where so many building remains of the feudal period are still\nstanding. Built originally in the heart of the forest, in the reign of\nPhilip le Bel, it now could be seen a few hundred yards from the road\nleading from the village of Sainte-Genevieve to Monthery. A mass of\ninharmonious structures, it is dominated by a donjon. When the visitor\nhas mounted the crumbling steps of this ancient donjon, he reaches a\nlittle plateau where, in the seventeenth century, Georges Philibert de\nSequigny, Lord of the Glandier, Maisons-Neuves and other places, built\nthe existing town in an abominably rococo style of architecture.\n\nIt was in this place, seemingly belonging entirely to the past, that\nProfessor Stangerson and his daughter installed themselves to lay the\nfoundations for the science of the future. Its solitude, in the depths\nof woods, was what, more than all, had pleased them. They would have\nnone to witness their labours and intrude on their hopes, but the aged\nstones and grand old oaks. The Glandier--ancient Glandierum--was so\ncalled from the quantity of glands (acorns) which, in all times, had\nbeen gathered in that neighbourhood. This land, of present mournful\ninterest, had fallen back, owing to the negligence or abandonment of\nits owners, into the wild character of primitive nature. The buildings\nalone, which were hidden there, had preserved traces of their strange\nmetamorphoses. Every age had left on them its imprint; a bit of\narchitecture with which was bound up the remembrance of some terrible\nevent, some bloody adventure. Such was the chateau in which science had\ntaken refuge--a place seemingly designed to be the theatre of mysteries,\nterror, and death.\n\nHaving explained so far, I cannot refrain from making one further\nreflection. If I have lingered a little over this description of the\nGlandier, it is not because I have reached the right moment for creating\nthe necessary atmosphere for the unfolding of the tragedy before the\neyes of the reader. Indeed, in all this matter, my first care will be\nto be as simple as is possible. I have no ambition to be an author. An\nauthor is always something of a romancer, and God knows, the mystery of\nThe Yellow Room is quite full enough of real tragic horror to require\nno aid from literary effects. I am, and only desire to be, a faithful\n\"reporter.\" My duty is to report the event; and I place the event in its\nframe--that is all. It is only natural that you should know where the\nthings happened.\n\nI return to Monsieur Stangerson. When he bought the estate, fifteen\nyears before the tragedy with which we are engaged occurred, the Chateau\ndu Glandier had for a long time been unoccupied. Another old chateau in\nthe neighbourhood, built in the fourteenth century by Jean de Belmont,\nwas also abandoned, so that that part of the country was very little\ninhabited. Some small houses on the side of the road leading to\nCorbeil, an inn, called the \"Auberge du Donjon,\" which offered passing\nhospitality to waggoners; these were about all to represent civilisation\nin this out-of-the-way part of the country, but a few leagues from the\ncapital.\n\nBut this deserted condition of the place had been the determining reason\nfor the choice made by Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter. Monsieur\nStangerson was already celebrated. He had returned from America, where\nhis works had made a great stir. The book which he had published at\nPhiladelphia, on the \"Dissociation of Matter by Electric Action,\" had\naroused opposition throughout the whole scientific world. Monsieur\nStangerson was a Frenchman, but of American origin. Important matters\nrelating to a legacy had kept him for several years in the United\nStates, where he had continued the work begun by him in France, whither\nhe had returned in possession of a large fortune. This fortune was a\ngreat boon to him; for, though he might have made millions of dollars\nby exploiting two or three of his chemical discoveries relative to new\nprocesses of dyeing, it was always repugnant to him to use for his\nown private gain the wonderful gift of invention he had received from\nnature. He considered he owed it to mankind, and all that his genius\nbrought into the world went, by this philosophical view of his duty,\ninto the public lap.\n\nIf he did not try to conceal his satisfaction at coming into possession\nof this fortune, which enabled him to give himself up to his passion for\npure science, he had equally to rejoice, it seemed to him, for another\ncause. Mademoiselle Stangerson was, at the time when her father returned\nfrom America and bought the Glandier estate, twenty years of age. She\nwas exceedingly pretty, having at once the Parisian grace of her mother,\nwho had died in giving her birth, and all the splendour, all the\nriches of the young American blood of her parental grandfather, William\nStangerson. A citizen of Philadelphia, William Stangerson had been\nobliged to become naturalised in obedience to family exigencies at the\ntime of his marriage with a French lady, she who was to be the mother\nof the illustrious Stangerson. In that way the professor's French\nnationality is accounted for.\n\nTwenty years of age, a charming blonde, with blue eyes, milk-white\ncomplexion, and radiant with divine health, Mathilde Stangerson was one\nof the most beautiful marriageable girls in either the old or the new\nworld. It was her father's duty, in spite of the inevitable pain which\na separation from her would cause him, to think of her marriage; and he\nwas fully prepared for it. Nevertheless, he buried himself and his child\nat the Glandier at the moment when his friends were expecting him to\nbring her out into society. Some of them expressed their astonishment,\nand to their questions he answered: \"It is my daughter's wish. I can\nrefuse her nothing. She has chosen the Glandier.\"\n\nInterrogated in her turn, the young girl replied calmly: \"Where could\nwe work better than in this solitude?\" For Mademoiselle Stangerson had\nalready begun to collaborate with her father in his work. It could not\nat the time be imagined that her passion for science would lead her so\nfar as to refuse all the suitors who presented themselves to her for\nover fifteen years. So secluded was the life led by the two, father and\ndaughter, that they showed themselves only at a few official\nreceptions and, at certain times in the year, in two or three friendly\ndrawing-rooms, where the fame of the professor and the beauty of\nMathilde made a sensation. The young girl's extreme reserve did not at\nfirst discourage suitors; but at the end of a few years, they tired of\ntheir quest.\n\nOne alone persisted with tender tenacity and deserved the name of\n\"eternal fiance,\" a name he accepted with melancholy resignation; that\nwas Monsieur Robert Darzac. Mademoiselle Stangerson was now no longer\nyoung, and it seemed that, having found no reason for marrying at\nfive-and-thirty, she would never find one. But such an argument\nevidently found no acceptance with Monsieur Robert Darzac. He continued\nto pay his court--if the delicate and tender attention with which he\nceaselessly surrounded this woman of five-and-thirty could be called\ncourtship--in face of her declared intention never to marry.\n\nSuddenly, some weeks before the events with which we are occupied, a\nreport--to which nobody attached any importance, so incredible did it\nsound--was spread about Paris, that Mademoiselle Stangerson had at\nlast consented to \"crown\" the inextinguishable flame of Monsieur Robert\nDarzac! It needed that Monsieur Robert Darzac himself should not deny\nthis matrimonial rumour to give it an appearance of truth, so unlikely\ndid it seem to be well founded. One day, however, Monsieur Stangerson,\nas he was leaving the Academy of Science, announced that the marriage\nof his daughter and Monsieur Robert Darzac would be celebrated in the\nprivacy of the Chateau du Glandier, as soon as he and his daughter had\nput the finishing touches to their report summing up their labours on\nthe \"Dissociation of Matter.\" The new household would install itself in\nthe Glandier, and the son-in-law would lend his assistance in the work\nto which the father and daughter had dedicated their lives.\n\nThe scientific world had barely had time to recover from the effect\nof this news, when it learned of the attempted assassination of\nMademoiselle under the extraordinary conditions which we have detailed\nand which our visit to the chateau was to enable us to ascertain with\nyet greater precision. I have not hesitated to furnish the reader\nwith all these retrospective details, known to me through my business\nrelations with Monsieur Robert Darzac. On crossing the threshold of The\nYellow Room he was as well posted as I was.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Makes a Remark to Monsieur\nRobert Darzac Which Produces Its Little Effect\n\nRouletabille and I had been walking for several minutes, by the side of\na long wall bounding the vast property of Monsieur Stangerson and had\nalready come within sight of the entrance gate, when our attention was\ndrawn to an individual who, half bent to the ground, seemed to be so\ncompletely absorbed in what he was doing as not to have seen us coming\ntowards him. At one time he stooped so low as almost to touch the\nground; at another he drew himself up and attentively examined the wall;\nthen he looked into the palm of one of his hands, and walked away with\nrapid strides. Finally he set off running, still looking into the palm\nof his hand. Rouletabille had brought me to a standstill by a gesture.\n\n\"Hush! Frederic Larsan is at work! Don't let us disturb him!\"\n\nRouletabille had a great admiration for the celebrated detective. I had\nnever before seen him, but I knew him well by reputation. At that time,\nbefore Rouletabille had given proof of his unique talent, Larsan was\nreputed as the most skilful unraveller of the most mysterious and\ncomplicated crimes. His reputation was world-wide, and the police of\nLondon, and even of America, often called him in to their aid when their\nown national inspectors and detectives found themselves at the end of\ntheir wits and resources.\n\nNo one was astonished, then, that the head of the Surete had, at the\noutset of the mystery of The Yellow Room, telegraphed his precious\nsubordinate to London, where he had been sent on a big case of stolen\nsecurities, to return with all haste. Frederic who, at the Surete, was\ncalled the \"great Frederic,\" had made all speed, doubtless knowing by\nexperience that, if he was interrupted in what he was doing, it was\nbecause his services were urgently needed in another direction; so, as\nRouletabille said, he was that morning already \"at work.\" We soon found\nout in what it consisted.\n\nWhat he was continually looking at in the palm of his right hand was\nnothing but his watch, the minute hand of which he appeared to be noting\nintently. Then he turned back still running, stopping only when he\nreached the park gate, where he again consulted his watch and then\nput it away in his pocket, shrugging his shoulders with a gesture of\ndiscouragement. He pushed open the park gate, reclosed and locked it,\nraised his head and, through the bars, perceived us. Rouletabille rushed\nafter him, and I followed. Frederic Larsan waited for us.\n\n\"Monsieur Fred,\" said Rouletabille, raising his hat and showing the\nprofound respect, based on admiration, which the young reporter felt\nfor the celebrated detective, \"can you tell me whether Monsieur Robert\nDarzac is at the chateau at this moment? Here is one of his friends, of\nthe Paris Bar, who desires to speak with him.\"\n\n\"I really don't know, Monsieur Rouletabille,\" replied Fred, shaking\nhands with my friend, whom he had several times met in the course of his\ndifficult investigations. \"I have not seen him.\"\n\n\"The concierges will be able to inform us no doubt?\" said Rouletabille,\npointing to the lodge the door and windows of which were close shut.\n\n\"The concierges will not be able to give you any information, Monsieur\nRouletabille.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because they were arrested half an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Arrested!\" cried Rouletabille; \"then they are the murderers!\"\n\nFrederic Larsan shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"When you can't arrest the real murderer,\" he said with an air of\nsupreme irony, \"you can always indulge in the luxury of discovering\naccomplices.\"\n\n\"Did you have them arrested, Monsieur Fred?\"\n\n\"Not I!--I haven't had them arrested. In the first place, I am pretty\nsure that they have not had anything to do with the affair, and then\nbecause--\"\n\n\"Because of what?\" asked Rouletabille eagerly.\n\n\"Because of nothing,\" said Larsan, shaking his head.\n\n\"Because there were no accomplices!\" said Rouletabille.\n\n\"Aha!--you have an idea, then, about this matter?\" said Larsan, looking\nat Rouletabille intently, \"yet you have seen nothing, young man--you\nhave not yet gained admission here!\"\n\n\"I shall get admission.\"\n\n\"I doubt it. The orders are strict.\"\n\n\"I shall gain admission, if you let me see Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do\nthat for me. You know we are old friends. I beg of you, Monsieur Fred.\nDo you remember the article I wrote about you on the gold bar case?\"\n\nThe face of Rouletabille at the moment was really funny to look at. It\nshowed such an irresistible desire to cross the threshold beyond\nwhich some prodigious mystery had occurred; it appealed with so much\neloquence, not only of the mouth and eyes, but with all its features,\nthat I could not refrain from bursting into laughter. Frederic Larsan,\nno more than myself, could retain his gravity. Meanwhile, standing\non the other side of the gate, he calmly put the key in his pocket. I\nclosely scrutinised him.\n\nHe might be about fifty years of age. He had a fine head, his hair\nturning grey; a colourless complexion, and a firm profile. His forehead\nwas prominent, his chin and cheeks clean shaven. His upper lip, without\nmoustache, was finely chiselled. His eyes were rather small and round,\nwith a look in them that was at once searching and disquieting. He was\nof middle height and well built, with a general bearing elegant and\ngentlemanly. There was nothing about him of the vulgar policeman. In\nhis way, he was an artist, and one felt that he had a high opinion of\nhimself. The sceptical tone of his conversation was that of a man who\nhad been taught by experience. His strange profession had brought him\ninto contact with so many crimes and villanies that it would have been\nremarkable if his nature had not been a little hardened.\n\nLarsan turned his head at the sound of a vehicle which had come from the\nchateau and reached the gate behind him. We recognised the cab which had\nconveyed the examining magistrate and his Registrar from the station at\nEpinay.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Frederic Larsan, \"if you want to speak with Monsieur Robert\nDarzac, he is here.\"\n\nThe cab was already at the park gate and Robert Darzac was begging\nFrederic Larsan to open it for him, explaining that he was pressed\nfor time to catch the next train leaving Epinay for Paris. Then he\nrecognised me. While Larsan was unlocking the gate, Monsieur Darzac\ninquired what had brought me to the Glandier at such a tragic moment. I\nnoticed that he was frightfully pale, and that his face was lined as if\nfrom the effects of some terrible suffering.\n\n\"Is Mademoiselle getting better?\" I immediately asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"She will be saved perhaps. She must be saved!\"\n\nHe did not add \"or it will be my death\"; but I felt that the phrase\ntrembled on his pale lips.\n\nRouletabille intervened:\n\n\"You are in a hurry, Monsieur; but I must speak with you. I have\nsomething of the greatest importance to tell you.\"\n\nFrederic Larsan interrupted:\n\n\"May I leave you?\" he asked of Robert Darzac. \"Have you a key, or do you\nwish me to give you this one.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I have a key and will lock the gate.\"\n\nLarsan hurried off in the direction of the chateau, the imposing pile of\nwhich could be perceived a few hundred yards away.\n\nRobert Darzac, with knit brow, was beginning to show impatience. I\npresented Rouletabille as a good friend of mine, but, as soon as\nhe learnt that the young man was a journalist, he looked at me very\nreproachfully, excused himself, under the necessity of having to\nreach Epinay in twenty minutes, bowed, and whipped up his horse. But\nRouletabille had seized the bridle and, to my utter astonishment,\nstopped the carriage with a vigorous hand. Then he gave utterance to a\nsentence which was utterly meaningless to me.\n\n\"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\nbrightness.\"\n\nThe words had no sooner left the lips of Rouletabille than I saw Robert\nDarzac quail. Pale as he was, he became paler. His eyes were fixed on\nthe young man in terror, and he immediately descended from the vehicle\nin an inexpressible state of agitation.\n\n\"Come!--come in!\" he stammered.\n\nThen, suddenly, and with a sort of fury, he repeated:\n\n\"Let us go, monsieur.\"\n\nHe turned up by the road he had come from the chateau, Rouletabille\nstill retaining his hold on the horse's bridle. I addressed a few\nwords to Monsieur Darzac, but he made no answer. My looks questioned\nRouletabille, but his gaze was elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. In the Heart of the Oak Grove\n\n\nWe reached the chateau, and, as we approached it, saw four gendarmes\npacing in front of a little door in the ground floor of the donjon. We\nsoon learned that in this ground floor, which had formerly served as\na prison, Monsieur and Madame Bernier, the concierges, were confined.\nMonsieur Robert Darzac led us into the modern part of the chateau by\na large door, protected by a projecting awning--a \"marquise\" as it is\ncalled. Rouletabille, who had resigned the horse and the cab to the care\nof a servant, never took his eyes off Monsieur Darzac. I followed his\nlook and perceived that it was directed solely towards the gloved hands\nof the Sorbonne professor. When we were in a tiny sitting-room fitted\nwith old furniture, Monsieur Darzac turned to Rouletabille and said\nsharply:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nThe reporter answered in an equally sharp tone:\n\n\"To shake you by the hand.\"\n\nDarzac shrank back.\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\nEvidently he understood, what I also understood, that my friend\nsuspected him of the abominable attempt on the life of Mademoiselle\nStangerson. The impression of the blood-stained hand on the walls of The\nYellow Room was in his mind. I looked at the man closely. His haughty\nface with its expression ordinarily so straightforward was at this\nmoment strangely troubled. He held out his right hand and, referring to\nme, said:\n\n\"As you are a friend of Monsieur Sainclair who has rendered me\ninvaluable services in a just cause, monsieur, I see no reason for\nrefusing you my hand--\"\n\nRouletabille did not take the extended hand. Lying with the utmost\naudacity, he said:\n\n\"Monsieur, I have lived several years in Russia, where I have acquired\nthe habit of never taking any but an ungloved hand.\"\n\nI thought that the Sorbonne professor would express his anger openly,\nbut, on the contrary, by a visibly violent effort, he calmed himself,\ntook off his gloves, and showed his hands; they were unmarked by any\ncicatrix.\n\n\"Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied Rouletabille. \"My dear friend,\" he said, turning to me, \"I\nam obliged to ask you to leave us alone for a moment.\"\n\nI bowed and retired; stupefied by what I had seen and heard. I could not\nunderstand why Monsieur Robert Darzac had not already shown the door to\nmy impertinent, insulting, and stupid friend. I was angry myself with\nRouletabille at that moment, for his suspicions, which had led to this\nscene of the gloves.\n\n\nFor some twenty minutes I walked about in front of the chateau, trying\nvainly to link together the different events of the day. What was in\nRouletabille's mind? Was it possible that he thought Monsieur Robert\nDarzac to be the murderer? How could it be thought that this man, who\nwas to have married Mademoiselle Stangerson in the course of a few days,\nhad introduced himself into The Yellow Room to assassinate his fiancee?\nI could find no explanation as to how the murderer had been able to\nleave The Yellow Room; and so long as that mystery, which appeared to me\nso inexplicable, remained unexplained, I thought it was the duty of\nall of us to refrain from suspecting anybody. But, then, that seemingly\nsenseless phrase--\"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the\ngarden its brightness\"--still rang in my ears. What did it mean? I was\neager to rejoin Rouletabille and question him.\n\nAt that moment the young man came out of the chateau in the company\nof Monsieur Robert Darzac, and, extraordinary to relate, I saw, at a\nglance, that they were the best of friends. \"We are going to The Yellow\nRoom. Come with us,\" Rouletabille said to me. \"You know, my dear boy, I\nam going to keep you with me all day. We'll breakfast together somewhere\nabout here--\"\n\n\"You'll breakfast with me, here, gentlemen--\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" replied the young man. \"We shall breakfast at the Donjon\nInn.\"\n\n\"You'll fare very badly there; you'll not find anything--\"\n\n\"Do you think so? Well, I hope to find something there,\" replied\nRouletabille. \"After breakfast, we'll set to work again. I'll write my\narticle and if you'll be so good as to take it to the office for me--\"\n\n\"Won't you come back with me to Paris?\"\n\n\"No; I shall remain here.\"\n\nI turned towards Rouletabille. He spoke quite seriously, and Monsieur\nRobert Darzac did not appear to be in the least degree surprised.\n\nWe were passing by the donjon and heard wailing voices. Rouletabille\nasked:\n\n\"Why have these people been arrested?\"\n\n\"It is a little my fault,\" said Monsieur Darzac. \"I happened to remark\nto the examining magistrate yesterday that it was inexplicable that the\nconcierges had had time to hear the revolver shots, to dress themselves,\nand to cover so great a distance as that which lies between their lodge\nand the pavilion, in the space of two minutes; for not more than that\ninterval of time had elapsed after the firing of the shots when they\nwere met by Daddy Jacques.\"\n\n\"That was suspicious evidently,\" acquiesced Rouletabille. \"And were they\ndressed?\"\n\n\"That is what is so incredible--they were dressed--completely--not one\npart of their costume wanting. The woman wore sabots, but the man had on\nlaced boots. Now they assert that they went to bed at half-past nine.\nOn arriving this morning, the examining magistrate brought with him from\nParis a revolver of the same calibre as that found in the room (for he\ncouldn't use the one held for evidence), and made his Registrar fire\ntwo shots in The Yellow Room while the doors and windows were closed. We\nwere with him in the lodge of the concierges, and yet we heard nothing,\nnot a sound. The concierges have lied, of that there can be no doubt.\nThey must have been already waiting, not far from the pavilion, waiting\nfor something! Certainly they are not to be accused of being the authors\nof the crime, but their complicity is not improbable. That was why\nMonsieur de Marquet had them arrested at once.\"\n\n\"If they had been accomplices,\" said Rouletabille, \"they would not have\nbeen there at all. When people throw themselves into the arms of justice\nwith the proofs of complicity on them, you can be sure they are not\naccomplices. I don't believe there are any accomplices in this affair.\"\n\n\"Then, why were they abroad at midnight? Why don't they say?\"\n\n\"They have certainly some reason for their silence. What that reason is,\nhas to be found out; for, even if they are not accomplices, it may be of\nimportance. Everything that took place on such a night is important.\"\n\nWe had crossed an old bridge thrown over the Douve and were entering the\npart of the park called the Oak Grove, The oaks here were centuries\nold. Autumn had already shrivelled their tawny leaves, and their high\nbranches, black and contorted, looked like horrid heads of hair, mingled\nwith quaint reptiles such as the ancient sculptors have made on the head\nof Medusa. This place, which Mademoiselle found cheerful and in which\nshe lived in the summer season, appeared to us as sad and funereal now.\nThe soil was black and muddy from the recent rains and the rotting of\nthe fallen leaves; the trunks of the trees were black and the sky above\nus was now, as if in mourning, charged with great, heavy clouds.\n\nAnd it was in this sombre and desolate retreat that we saw the white\nwalls of the pavilion as we approached. A queer-looking building without\na window visible on the side by which we neared it. A little door alone\nmarked the entrance to it. It might have passed for a tomb, a vast\nmausoleum in the midst of a thick forest. As we came nearer, we were\nable to make out its disposition. The building obtained all the light it\nneeded from the south, that is to say, from the open country. The little\ndoor closed on the park. Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson must have\nfound it an ideal seclusion for their work and their dreams.\n\n\n   ___________________________________________________\n                        ditch                         |\n   ________________________________________________   |\n    enclosing wall      ||            ||           |  |\n                        ||            ||           |  |\n                        ||___   1                  |d |\n                        ||bed|        ||           |i |\n         PARK           ||___|________||           |t |\n                        ||:::::|  4   ||           |c |\n                        ||::5::|      ||    2      |h |\n   oo  oo               ||::::|___  _||            |  |\n   Traces   oo          ||            ||           |  |\n            of  oo oo oo                           |  |\n               Footsteps||            ||           |  |\n                        ||            ||           |  |\n                        ||   3        ||___________|  |______________\n                        ||            ||    6      |      ditch\n                        ||____    ____||___________|_________________\n                              door                    enclosing wall\n\n\n\nHere is the ground plan of the pavilion. It had a ground-floor which was\nreached by a few steps, and above it was an attic, with which we need\nnot concern ourselves. The plan of the ground-floor only, sketched\nroughly, is what I here submit to the reader.\n\n  1. The Yellow Room, with its one window and its one door opening\n     into the laboratory.\n\n  2. Laboratory, with its two large, barred windows and its doors,\n     one serving for the vestibule, the other for The Yellow Room.\n\n  3. Vestibule, with its unbarred window and door opening into the\n     park.\n\n  4. Lavatory.\n\n  5. Stairs leading to the attic.\n\n  6. Large and the only chimney in the pavilion, serving for the\n      experiments of the laboratory.\n\nThe plan was drawn by Rouletabille, and I assured myself that there was\nnot a line in it that was wanting to help to the solution of the\nproblem then set before the police. With the lines of this plan and the\ndescription of its parts before them, my readers will know as much as\nRouletabille knew when he entered the pavilion for the first time. With\nhim they may now ask: How did the murderer escape from The Yellow Room?\nBefore mounting the three steps leading up to the door of the pavilion,\nRouletabille stopped and asked Monsieur Darzac point blank:\n\n\"What was the motive for the crime?\"\n\n\"Speaking for myself, Monsieur, there can be no doubt on the matter,\"\nsaid Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiance, greatly distressed. \"The nails of\nthe fingers, the deep scratches on the chest and throat of Mademoiselle\nStangerson show that the wretch who attacked her attempted to commit a\nfrightful crime. The medical experts who examined these traces yesterday\naffirm that they were made by the same hand as that which left its red\nimprint on the wall; an enormous hand, Monsieur, much too large to go\ninto my gloves,\" he added with an indefinable smile.\n\n\"Could not that blood-stained hand,\" I interrupted, \"have been the hand\nof Mademoiselle Stangerson who, in the moment of falling, had pressed it\nagainst the wall, and, in slipping, enlarged the impression?\"\n\n\"There was not a drop of blood on either of her hands when she was\nlifted up,\" replied Monsieur Darzac.\n\n\"We are now sure,\" said I, \"that it was Mademoiselle Stangerson who was\narmed with Daddy Jacques's revolver, since she wounded the hand of the\nmurderer. She was in fear, then, of somebody or something.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"Do you suspect anybody?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Monsieur Darzac, looking at Rouletabille. Rouletabille\nthen said to me:\n\n\"You must know, my friend, that the inquiry is a little more advanced\nthan Monsieur de Marquet has chosen to tell us. He not only knows that\nMademoiselle Stangerson defended herself with the revolver, but he knows\nwhat the weapon was that was used to attack her. Monsieur Darzac tells\nme it was a mutton-bone. Why is Monsieur de Marquet surrounding\nthis mutton-bone with so much mystery? No doubt for the purpose of\nfacilitating the inquiries of the agents of the Surete? He imagines,\nperhaps, that the owner of this instrument of crime, the most terrible\ninvented, is going to be found amongst those who are well-known in the\nslums of Paris who use it. But who can ever say what passes through the\nbrain of an examining magistrate?\" Rouletabille added with contemptuous\nirony.\n\n\"Has a mutton-bone been found in The Yellow Room?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur,\" said Robert Darzac, \"at the foot of the bed; but I beg\nof you not to say anything about it.\" (I made a gesture of assent.) \"It\nwas an enormous mutton-bone, the top of which, or rather the joint, was\nstill red with the blood of the frightful wound. It was an old bone,\nwhich may, according to appearances, have served in other crimes. That's\nwhat Monsieur de Marquet thinks. He has had it sent to the municipal\nlaboratory at Paris to be analysed. In fact, he thinks he has detected\non it, not only the blood of the last victim, but other stains of dried\nblood, evidences of previous crimes.\"\n\n\"A mutton-bone in the hand of a skilled assassin is a frightful weapon,\"\nsaid Rouletabille, \"a more certain weapon than a heavy hammer.\"\n\n\"The scoundrel has proved it to be so,\" said Monsieur Robert Darzac,\nsadly. \"The joint of the bone found exactly fits the wound inflicted.\n\n\"My belief is that the wound would have been mortal, if the murderer's\nblow had not been arrested in the act by Mademoiselle Stangerson's\nrevolver. Wounded in the hand, he dropped the mutton-bone and fled.\nUnfortunately, the blow had been already given, and Mademoiselle was\nstunned after having been nearly strangled. If she had succeeded\nin wounding the man with the first shot of the revolver, she would,\ndoubtless, have escaped the blow with the bone. But she had certainly\nemployeeed her revolver too late; the first shot deviated and lodged in\nthe ceiling; it was the second only that took effect.\"\n\nHaving said this, Monsieur Darzac knocked at the door of the pavilion. I\nmust confess to feeling a strong impatience to reach the spot where the\ncrime had been committed. It was some time before the door was opened by\na man whom I at once recognised as Daddy Jacques.\n\nHe appeared to be well over sixty years of age. He had a long white\nbeard and white hair, on which he wore a flat Basque cap. He was dressed\nin a complete suit of chestnut-coloured velveteen, worn at the sides;\nsabots were on his feet. He had rather a waspish-looking face, the\nexpression of which lightened, however, as soon as he saw Monsieur\nDarzac.\n\n\"Friends,\" said our guide. \"Nobody in the pavilion, Daddy Jacques?\"\n\n\"I ought not to allow anybody to enter, Monsieur Robert, but of course\nthe order does not apply to you. These gentlemen of justice have seen\neverything there is to be seen, and made enough drawings, and drawn up\nenough reports--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Monsieur Jacques, one question before anything else,\" said\nRouletabille.\n\n\"What is it, young man? If I can answer it--\"\n\n\"Did your mistress wear her hair in bands, that evening? You know what I\nmean--over her forehead?\"\n\n\"No, young man. My mistress never wore her hair in the way you suggest,\nneither on that day nor on any other. She had her hair drawn up, as\nusual, so that her beautiful forehead could be seen, pure as that of an\nunborn child!\"\n\nRouletabille grunted and set to work examining the door, finding that it\nfastened itself automatically. He satisfied himself that it could never\nremain open and needed a key to open it. Then we entered the vestibule,\na small, well-lit room paved with square red tiles.\n\n\"Ah! This is the window by which the murderer escaped!\" said\nRouletabille.\n\n\"So they keep on saying, monsieur, so they keep on saying! But if he had\ngone off that way, we should have been sure to have seen him. We are not\nblind, neither Monsieur Stangerson nor me, nor the concierges who are\nin prison. Why have they not put me in prison, too, on account of my\nrevolver?\"\n\nRouletabille had already opened the window and was examining the\nshutters.\n\n\"Were these closed at the time of the crime?\"\n\n\"And fastened with the iron catch inside,\" said Daddy Jacques, \"and I am\nquite sure that the murderer did not get out that way.\"\n\n\"Are there any blood stains?\"\n\n\"Yes, on the stones outside; but blood of what?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Rouletabille, \"there are footmarks visible on the path--the\nground was very moist. I will look into that presently.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" interrupted Daddy Jacques; \"the murderer did not go that\nway.\"\n\n\"Which way did he go, then?\"\n\n\"How do I know?\"\n\nRouletabille looked at everything, smelled everything. He went down\non his knees and rapidly examined every one of the paving tiles. Daddy\nJacques went on:\n\n\"Ah!--you can't find anything, monsieur. Nothing has been found. And now\nit is all dirty; too many persons have tramped over it. They wouldn't\nlet me wash it, but on the day of the crime I had washed the floor\nthoroughly, and if the murderer had crossed it with his hobnailed boots,\nI should not have failed to see where he had been; he has left marks\nenough in Mademoiselle's chamber.\"\n\nRouletabille rose.\n\n\"When was the last time you washed these tiles?\" he asked, and he fixed\non Daddy Jacques a most searching look.\n\n\"Why--as I told you--on the day of the crime, towards half-past\nfive--while Mademoiselle and her father were taking a little walk before\ndinner, here in this room: they had dined in the laboratory. The next\nday, the examining magistrate came and saw all the marks there were on\nthe floor as plainly as if they had been made with ink on white paper.\nWell, neither in the laboratory nor in the vestibule, which were both\nas clean as a new pin, were there any traces of a man's footmarks. Since\nthey have been found near this window outside, he must have made his way\nthrough the ceiling of The Yellow Room into the attic, then cut his way\nthrough the roof and dropped to the ground outside the vestibule window.\nBut--there's no hole, neither in the ceiling of The Yellow Room nor\nin the roof of my attic--that's absolutely certain! So you see we know\nnothing--nothing! And nothing will ever be known! It's a mystery of the\nDevil's own making.\"\n\nRouletabille went down upon his knees again almost in front of a small\nlavatory at the back of the vestibule. In that position he remained for\nabout a minute.\n\n\"Well?\" I asked him when he got up.\n\n\"Oh! nothing very important,--a drop of blood,\" he replied, turning\ntowards Daddy Jacques as he spoke. \"While you were washing the\nlaboratory and this vestibule, was the vestibule window open?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, Monsieur, it was closed; but after I had done washing the floor, I\nlit some charcoal for Monsieur in the laboratory furnace, and, as I lit\nit with old newspapers, it smoked, so I opened both the windows in the\nlaboratory and this one, to make a current of air; then I shut those in\nthe laboratory and left this one open when I went out. When I\nreturned to the pavilion, this window had been closed and Monsieur and\nMademoiselle were already at work in the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Monsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, shut it?\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"You did not ask them?\"\n\nAfter a close scrutiny of the little lavatory and of the staircase\nleading up to the attic, Rouletabille--to whom we seemed no longer to\nexist--entered the laboratory. I followed him. It was, I confess, in\na state of great excitement. Robert Darzac lost none of my friend's\nmovements. As for me, my eyes were drawn at once to the door of\nThe Yellow Room. It was closed and, as I immediately saw, partially\nshattered and out of commission.\n\nMy friend, who went about his work methodically, silently studied\nthe room in which we were. It was large and well-lighted. Two big\nwindows--almost bays--were protected by strong iron bars and looked out\nupon a wide extent of country. Through an opening in the forest, they\ncommanded a wonderful view through the length of the valley and across\nthe plain to the large town which could be clearly seen in fair weather.\nTo-day, however, a mist hung over the ground--and blood in that room!\n\nThe whole of one side of the laboratory was taken up with a large\nchimney, crucibles, ovens, and such implements as are needed for\nchemical experiments; tables, loaded with phials, papers, reports,\nan electrical machine,--an apparatus, as Monsieur Darzac informed me,\nemployeeed by Professor Stangerson to demonstrate the Dissociation of\nMatter under the action of solar light--and other scientific implements.\n\nAlong the walls were cabinets, plain or glass-fronted, through which\nwere visible microscopes, special photographic apparatus, and a large\nquantity of crystals.\n\nRouletabille, who was ferreting in the chimney, put his fingers into one\nof the crucibles. Suddenly he drew himself up, and held up a piece of\nhalf-consumed paper in his hand. He stepped up to where we were talking\nby one of the windows.\n\n\"Keep that for us, Monsieur Darzac,\" he said.\n\nI bent over the piece of scorched paper which Monsieur Darzac took\nfrom the hand of Rouletabille, and read distinctly the only words that\nremained legible:\n\n\"Presbytery--lost nothing--charm, nor the gar--its brightness.\"\n\nTwice since the morning these same meaningless words had struck me, and,\nfor the second time, I saw that they produced on the Sorbonne professor\nthe same paralysing effect. Monsieur Darzac's first anxiety showed\nitself when he turned his eyes in the direction of Daddy Jacques.\nBut, occupied as he was at another window, he had seen nothing. Then\ntremblingly opening his pocket-book he put the piece of paper into it,\nsighing: \"My God!\"\n\nDuring this time, Rouletabille had mounted into the opening of the\nfire-grate--that is to say, he had got upon the bricks of a furnace--and\nwas attentively examining the chimney, which grew narrower towards the\ntop, the outlet from it being closed with sheets of iron, fastened into\nthe brickwork, through which passed three small chimneys.\n\n\"Impossible to get out that way,\" he said, jumping back into the\nlaboratory. \"Besides, even if he had tried to do it, he would have\nbrought all that ironwork down to the ground. No, no; it is not on that\nside we have to search.\"\n\nRouletabille next examined the furniture and opened the doors of the\ncabinet. Then he came to the windows, through which he declared no one\ncould possibly have passed. At the second window he found Daddy Jacques\nin contemplation.\n\n\"Well, Daddy Jacques,\" he said, \"what are you looking at?\"\n\n\"That policeman who is always going round and round the lake. Another of\nthose fellows who think they can see better than anybody else!\"\n\n\"You don't know Frederic Larsan, Daddy Jacques, or you wouldn't speak of\nhim in that way,\" said Rouletabille in a melancholy tone. \"If there\nis anyone who will find the murderer, it will be he.\" And Rouletabille\nheaved a deep sigh.\n\n\"Before they find him, they will have to learn how they lost him,\" said\nDaddy Jacques, stolidly.\n\nAt length we reached the door of The Yellow Room itself.\n\n\"There is the door behind which some terrible scene took place,\" said\nRouletabille, with a solemnity which, under any other circumstances,\nwould have been comical.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. In Which Rouletabille Sets Out on an Expedition Under the\nBed\n\n\nRouletabille having pushed open the door of The Yellow Room paused on\nthe threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later understood,\n\"Ah, the perfume of the lady in black!\"\n\nThe chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds when\nRouletabille stopped him.\n\n\"Did not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, young man, I don't think so. Mademoiselle always had a nightlight\non her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed. I was\na sort of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening came. The\nreal chambermaid did not come here much before the morning. Mademoiselle\nworked late--far into the night.\"\n\n\"Where did the table with the night-light stand,--far from the bed?\"\n\n\"Some way from the bed.\"\n\n\"Can you light the burner now?\"\n\n\"The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when the\ntable was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain just as\nthey were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see.\"\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nRouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters of the\ntwo windows and the door of the vestibule.\n\nWhen we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked Daddy\nJacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to the place where\nthe night-light was burning that night.\n\nDaddy Jacques who was in his stockings--he usually left his sabots\nin the vestibule--entered The Yellow Room with his bit of a vesta. We\nvaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor, a bed in one\ncorner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam of a looking-glass\nhanging on the wall, near to the bed.\n\n\"That will do!--you may now open the blinds,\" said Rouletabille.\n\n\"Don't come any further,\" Daddy Jacques begged, \"you may make marks\nwith your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it's an idea of the\nmagistrate's--though he has nothing more to do here.\"\n\nAnd he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from without,\nthrowing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls. The floor--for\nthough the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled, The Yellow Room had\na flooring of wood--was covered with a single yellow mat which was\nlarge enough to cover nearly the whole room, under the bed and under the\ndressing-table--the only piece of furniture that remained upright. The\ncentre round table, the night-table and two chairs had been overturned.\nThese did not prevent a large stain of blood being visible on the mat,\nmade, as Daddy Jacques informed us, by the blood which had flowed from\nthe wound on Mademoiselle Stangerson's forehead. Besides these stains,\ndrops of blood had fallen in all directions, in line with the visible\ntraces of the footsteps--large and black--of the murderer. Everything\nled to the presumption that these drops of blood had fallen from the\nwound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red hand on the wall.\nThere were other traces of the same hand on the wall, but much less\ndistinct.\n\n\"See!--see this blood on the wall!\" I could not help exclaiming.\n\"The man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness must\ncertainly have thought that he was pushing at a door! That's why\nhe pressed on it so hard, leaving on the yellow paper the terrible\nevidence. I don't think there are many hands in the world of that sort.\nIt is big and strong and the fingers are nearly all one as long as the\nother! The thumb is wanting and we have only the mark of the palm; but\nif we follow the trace of the hand,\" I continued, \"we see that, after\nleaving its imprint on the wall, the touch sought the door, found it,\nand then felt for the lock--\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,--\"only there is no\nblood, either on the lock or on the bolt!\"\n\n\"What does that prove?\" I rejoined with a good sense of which I was\nproud; \"he might have opened the lock with his left hand, which would\nhave been quite natural, his right hand being wounded.\"\n\n\"He didn't open it at all!\" Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. \"We are not\nfools; and there were four of us when we burst open the door!\"\n\n\"What a queer hand!--Look what a queer hand it is!\" I said.\n\n\"It is a very natural hand,\" said Rouletabille, \"of which the shape has\nbeen deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The man dried his hand\non the wall. He must be a man about five feet eight in height.\"\n\n\"How do you come at that?\"\n\n\"By the height of the marks on the wall.\"\n\nMy friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in the wall.\nIt was a round hole.\n\n\"This ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently, not\nfrom below.\"\n\nRouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the lock and\nthe bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly been burst open\nfrom the outside, and, further, that the key had been found in the lock\non the inside of the chamber. He finally satisfied himself that with the\nkey in the lock, the door could not possibly be opened from without with\nanother key. Having made sure of all these details, he let fall these\nwords: \"That's better!\"--Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily\ntook off his boots and, in his socks, went into the room.\n\nThe first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned furniture.\nWe watched him in silence.\n\n\"Young fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,\" said\nDaddy Jacques ironically.\n\nRouletabille raised his head and said:\n\n\"You have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress did not\nhave her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to have believed she\ndid.\"\n\nThen, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the bed.\nPresently we heard him ask:\n\n\"At what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle\nStangerson arrive at the laboratory?\"\n\n\"At six o'clock.\"\n\nThe voice of Rouletabille continued:\n\n\"Yes,--he's been under here,--that's certain; in fact, there was no\nwhere else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too, are the marks\nof his hobnails. When you entered--all four of you--did you look under\nthe bed?\"\n\n\"At once,--we drew it right out of its place--\"\n\n\"And between the mattresses?\"\n\n\"There was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was placed; and\nMonsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately carried it into the\nlaboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing but the metal netting,\nwhich could not conceal anything or anybody. Remember, monsieur, that\nthere were four of us and we couldn't fail to see everything--the\nchamber is so small and scantily furnished, and all was locked behind in\nthe pavilion.\"\n\nI ventured on a hypothesis:\n\n\"Perhaps he got away with the mattress--in the mattress!--Anything\nis possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress of mind\nMonsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed they were\nbearing a double weight; especially if the concierge were an accomplice!\nI throw out this hypothesis for what it is worth, but it explains many\nthings,--and particularly the fact that neither the laboratory nor the\nvestibule bear any traces of the footmarks found in the room. If,\nin carrying Mademoiselle on the mattress from the laboratory of the\nchateau, they rested for a moment, there might have been an opportunity\nfor the man in it to escape.\n\n\"And then?\" asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the bed.\n\nI felt rather vexed and replied:\n\n\"I don't know,--but anything appears possible\"--\n\n\"The examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur,\" said Daddy\nJacques, \"and he carefully examined the mattress. He was obliged to\nlaugh at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing now,--for whoever\nheard of a mattress having a double bottom?\"\n\nI was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said was\nabsurd; but in an affair like this one hardly knows where an absurdity\nbegins or ends.\n\nMy friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called out from\nunder the bed.\n\n\"The mat here has been moved out of place,--who did it?\"\n\n\"We did, monsieur,\" explained Daddy Jacques. \"When we could not find\nthe assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some hole in the\nfloor--\"\n\n\"There is not,\" replied Rouletabille. \"Is there a cellar?\"\n\n\"No, there's no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching, and has\nnot prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar from studying\nthe floor plank by plank, as if there had been a cellar under it.\"\n\nThe reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his nostrils\nquivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could not be better\nlikened than to an admirable sporting dog on the scent of some unusual\ngame. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps of a man,--the man whom he\nhas sworn to report to his master, the manager of the \"Epoque.\" It must\nnot be forgotten that Rouletabille was first and last a journalist.\n\nThus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners of the\nroom, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything--everything that\nwe could see, which was not much, and everything that we could not see,\nwhich must have been infinite.\n\nThe toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs; there was\nnothing about it by which it could possibly be changed into a temporary\nhiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard. Mademoiselle\nStangerson kept her wardrobe at the chateau.\n\nRouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,\nconstructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the walls, and\npassed his agile fingers over every portion of the yellow paper covering\nthem, he reached to the ceiling, which he was able to touch by mounting\non a chair placed on the toilette table, and by moving this ingeniously\nconstructed stage from place to place he examined every foot of it. When\nhe had finished his scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined\nthe hole made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once\nmore, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid and\nintact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared \"Now I am\nat ease!\"\n\n\"Well,--do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut up when\nshe was being murdered--when she cried out for help?\" wailed Daddy\nJacques.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young reporter, drying his forehead, \"The Yellow Room\nwas as tightly shut as an iron safe.\"\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"is why this mystery is the most surprising I know.\nEdgar Allan Poe, in 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue,' invented nothing\nlike it. The place of that crime was sufficiently closed to prevent the\nescape of a man; but there was that window through which the monkey, the\nperpetrator of the murder, could slip away! But here, there can be no\nquestion of an opening of any sort. The door was fastened, and through\nthe window blinds, secure as they were, not even a fly could enter or\nget out.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his forehead,\nwhich seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily exertion than\nfrom his mental agitation. \"Indeed, it's a great, a beautiful, and a\nvery curious mystery.\"\n\n\"The Bete du bon Dieu,\" muttered Daddy Jacques, \"the Bete du bon Dieu\nherself, if she had committed the crime, could not have escaped. Listen!\nDo you hear it? Hush!\"\n\nDaddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his arm\ntowards the wall nearest the forest, listened to something which we\ncould not hear.\n\n\"It's answering,\" he said at length. \"I must kill it. It is too wicked,\nbut it's the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes to pray on the\ntomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch her, for fear that\nMother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on them.\"\n\n\"How big is the Bete du bon Dieu?\"\n\n\"Nearly as big as a small retriever,--a monster, I tell you. Ah!--I have\nasked myself more than once whether it was not her that took our poor\nMademoiselle by the throat with her claws. But the Bete du bon Dieu does\nnot wear hobnailed boots, nor fire revolvers, nor has she a hand like\nthat!\" exclaimed Daddy Jacques, again pointing out to us the red mark\non the wall. \"Besides, we should have seen her as well as we would have\nseen a man--\"\n\n\"Evidently,\" I said. \"Before we had seen this Yellow Room, I had also\nasked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux--\"\n\n\"You also!\" cried Rouletabille.\n\n\"Didn't you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not for a moment. After reading the article in the 'Matin,' I knew\nthat a cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear now that\na frightful tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing about the\nBasque cap, or the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?\"\n\n\"Of course, the magistrate has taken them,\" the old man answered,\nhesitatingly.\n\n\"I haven't seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can tell you\nhow they are made,\" the reporter said to him gravely.\n\n\"Oh, you are very clever,\" said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.\n\n\"The handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the cap is\nan old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now.\"\n\n\"You are a wizard!\" said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not quite\nsucceeding. \"How do you know that the handkerchief is blue with red\nstripes?\"\n\n\"Because, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would not have\nbeen found at all.\"\n\nWithout giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend took a\npiece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of scissors, bent\nover the footprints. Placing the paper over one of them he began to cut.\nIn a short time he had made a perfect pattern which he handed to me,\nbegging me not to lose it.\n\nHe then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of Frederic\nLarsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked Daddy Jacques\nwhether the detective had, like himself, been working in The Yellow\nRoom?\n\n\"No,\" replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed him the\npiece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, \"He pretends that he\ndoes not need to examine The Yellow Room. He says that the murderer\nmade his escape from it in quite a natural way, and that he will, this\nevening, explain how he did it.\"\n\nAs he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille turned\npale.\n\n\"Has Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess at?\" he\nmurmured. \"He is very clever--very clever--and I admire him. But what\nwe have to do to-day is something more than the work of a policeman,\nsomething quite different from the teachings of experience. We have to\ntake hold of our reason by the right end.\"\n\nThe reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought that\nthe great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution of the\nproblem of The Yellow Room.\n\nI managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. \"Calm yourself,\nmy dear fellow,\" I said. \"Aren't you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. \"I am quite satisfied. I\nhave discovered many things.\"\n\n\"Moral or material?\"\n\n\"Several moral,--one material. This, for example.\"\n\nAnd rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper in which\nhe had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman's head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. The Examining Magistrate Questions Mademoiselle Stangerson\n\n\nTwo minutes later, as Rouletabille was bending over the footprints\ndiscovered in the park, under the window of the vestibule, a man,\nevidently a servant at the chateau, came towards us rapidly and called\nout to Monsieur Darzac then coming out of the pavilion:\n\n\"Monsieur Robert, the magistrate, you know, is questioning\nMademoiselle.\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac uttered a muttered excuse to us and set off running\ntowards the chateau, the man running after him.\n\n\"If the corpse can speak,\" I said, \"it would be interesting to be\nthere.\"\n\n\"We must know,\" said my friend. \"Let's go to the chateau.\" And he drew\nme with him. But, at the chateau, a gendarme placed in the vestibule\ndenied us admission up the staircase of the first floor. We were obliged\nto wait down stairs.\n\nThis is what passed in the chamber of the victim while we were waiting\nbelow.\n\nThe family doctor, finding that Mademoiselle Stangerson was much\nbetter, but fearing a relapse which would no longer permit of her being\nquestioned, had thought it his duty to inform the examining magistrate\nof this, who decided to proceed immediately with a brief examination.\nAt this examination, the Registrar, Monsieur Stangerson, and the\ndoctor were present. Later, I obtained the text of the report of the\nexamination, and I give it here, in all its legal dryness:\n\n\"Question. Are you able, mademoiselle, without too much fatiguing\nyourself, to give some necessary details of the frightful attack of\nwhich you have been the victim?\n\n\"Answer. I feel much better, monsieur, and I will tell you all I know.\nWhen I entered my chamber I did not notice anything unusual there.\n\n\"Q. Excuse me, mademoiselle,--if you will allow me, I will ask you some\nquestions and you will answer them. That will fatigue you less than\nmaking a long recital.\n\n\"A. Do so, monsieur.\n\n\"Q. What did you do on that day?--I want you to be as minute and precise\nas possible. I wish to know all you did that day, if it is not asking\ntoo much of you.\n\n\"A. I rose late, at ten o'clock, for my father and I had returned home\nlate on the night previously, having been to dinner at the reception\ngiven by the President of the Republic, in honour of the Academy of\nScience of Philadelphia. When I left my chamber, at half-past ten, my\nfather was already at work in the laboratory. We worked together\ntill midday. We then took half-an-hour's walk in the park, as we were\naccustomed to do, before breakfasting at the chateau. After breakfast,\nwe took another walk for half an hour, and then returned to the\nlaboratory. There we found my chambermaid, who had come to set my room\nin order. I went into The Yellow Room to give her some slight orders and\nshe directly afterwards left the pavilion, and I resumed my work with\nmy father. At five o'clock, we again went for a walk in the park and\nafterward had tea.\n\n\"Q. Before leaving the pavilion at five o'clock, did you go into your\nchamber?\n\n\"A. No, monsieur, my father went into it, at my request to bring me my\nhat.\n\n\"Q. And he found nothing suspicious there?\n\n\"A. Evidently no, monsieur.\n\n\"Q. It is, then, almost certain that the murderer was not yet concealed\nunder the bed. When you went out, was the door of the room locked?\n\n\"A. No, there was no reason for locking it.\n\n\"Q. You were absent from the pavilion some length of time, Monsieur\nStangerson and you?\n\n\"A. About an hour.\n\n\"Q. It was during that hour, no doubt, that the murderer got into the\npavilion. But how? Nobody knows. Footmarks have been found in the park,\nleading away from the window of the vestibule, but none has been found\ngoing towards it. Did you notice whether the vestibule window was open\nwhen you went out?\n\n\"A. I don't remember.\n\n\"Monsieur Stangerson. It was closed.\n\n\"Q. And when you returned?\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson. I did not notice.\n\n\"M. Stangerson. It was still closed. I remember remarking aloud: 'Daddy\nJacques must surely have opened it while we were away.'\n\n\"Q. Strange!--Do you recollect, Monsieur Stangerson, if during your\nabsence, and before going out, he had opened it? You returned to the\nlaboratory at six o'clock and resumed work?\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson. Yes, monsieur.\n\n\"Q. And you did not leave the laboratory from that hour up to the moment\nwhen you entered your chamber?\n\n\"M. Stangerson. Neither my daughter nor I, monsieur. We were engaged on\nwork that was pressing, and we lost not a moment,--neglecting everything\nelse on that account.\n\n\"Q. Did you dine in the laboratory?\n\n\"A. For that reason.\n\n\"Q. Are you accustomed to dine in the laboratory?\n\n\"A. We rarely dine there.\n\n\"Q. Could the murderer have known that you would dine there that\nevening?\n\n\"M. Stangerson. Good Heavens!--I think not. It was only when we returned\nto the pavilion at six o'clock, that we decided, my daughter and I,\nto dine there. At that moment I was spoken to by my gamekeeper, who\ndetained me a moment, to ask me to accompany him on an urgent tour of\ninspection in a part of the woods which I had decided to thin. I put\nthis off until the next day, and begged him, as he was going by the\nchateau, to tell the steward that we should dine in the laboratory.\nHe left me, to execute the errand and I rejoined my daughter, who was\nalready at work.\n\n\"Q. At what hour, mademoiselle, did you go to your chamber while your\nfather continued to work there?\n\n\"A. At midnight.\n\n\"Q. Did Daddy Jacques enter The Yellow Room in the course of the\nevening?\n\n\"A. To shut the blinds and light the night-light.\n\n\"Q. He saw nothing suspicious?\n\n\"A. He would have told us if he had seen. Daddy Jacques is an honest man\nand very attached to me.\n\n\"Q. You affirm, Monsieur Stangerson, that Daddy Jacques remained with\nyou all the time you were in the laboratory?\n\n\"M. Stangerson. I am sure of it. I have no doubt of that.\n\n\"Q. When you entered your chamber, mademoiselle, you immediately shut\nthe door and locked and bolted it? That was taking unusual precautions,\nknowing that your father and your servant were there? Were you in fear\nof something, then?\n\n\"A. My father would be returning to the chateau and Daddy Jacques would\nbe going to his bed. And, in fact, I did fear something.\n\n\"Q. You were so much in fear of something that you borrowed Daddy\nJacques's revolver without telling him you had done so?\n\n\"A. That is true. I did not wish to alarm anybody,--the more, because my\nfears might have proved to have been foolish.\n\n\"Q. What was it you feared?\n\n\"A. I hardly know how to tell you. For several nights, I seemed to\nhear, both in the park and out of the park, round the pavilion, unusual\nsounds, sometimes footsteps, at other times the cracking of branches.\nThe night before the attack on me, when I did not get to bed before\nthree o'clock in the morning, on our return from the Elysee, I stood for\na moment before my window, and I felt sure I saw shadows.\n\n\"Q. How many?\n\n\"A. Two. They moved round the lake,--then the moon became clouded and\nI lost sight of them. At this time of the season, every year, I have\ngenerally returned to my apartment in the chateau for the winter; but\nthis year I said to myself that I would not quit the pavilion before\nmy father had finished the resume of his works on the 'Dissociation of\nMatter' for the Academy. I did not wish that that important work, which\nwas to have been finished in the course of a few days, should be delayed\nby a change in our daily habit. You can well understand that I did not\nwish to speak of my childish fears to my father, nor did I say anything\nto Daddy Jacques who, I knew, would not have been able to hold his\ntongue. Knowing that he had a revolver in his room, I took advantage of\nhis absence and borrowed it, placing it in the drawer of my night-table.\n\n   \"Q. You know of no enemies you have?\n\n   \"A. None.\n\n   \"Q. You understand, mademoiselle, that these precautions are\n        calculated to cause surprise?\n\n   \"M. Stangerson. Evidently, my child, such precautions are very\n        surprising.\n\n   \"A. No;--because I have told you that I had been uneasy for two\n        nights.\n\n   \"M. Stangerson. You ought to have told me of that! This misfortune\n        would have been avoided.\n\n   \"Q. The door of The Yellow Room locked, did you go to bed?\n\n   \"A. Yes, and, being very tired, I at once went to sleep.\n\n   \"Q. The night-light was still burning?\n\n   \"A. Yes, but it gave a very feeble light.\n\n   \"Q. Then, mademoiselle, tell us what happened.\n\n   \"A. I do not know whether I had been long asleep, but suddenly I\n        awoke--and uttered a loud cry.\n\n   \"M. Stangerson. Yes--a horrible cry--'Murder!'--It still rings\n        in my ears.\n\n   \"Q. You uttered a loud cry?\n\n   \"A. A man was in my chamber. He sprang at me and tried to strangle\n        me.  I was nearly stifled when suddenly I was able to reach the\n        drawer of my night-table and grasp the revolver which I had\n        placed in it.  At that moment the man had forced me to the foot\n        of my bed and brandished in over my head a sort of mace.  But\n        I had fired.  He immediately struck a terrible blow at my head.\n        All that, monsieur, passed more rapidly than I can tell it, and\n        I know nothing more.\n\n   \"Q. Nothing?--Have you no idea as to how the assassin could\n        escape from your chamber?\n\n   \"A. None whatever--I know nothing more. One does not know what\n        is passing around one, when one is unconscious.\n\n   \"Q. Was the man you saw tall or short, little or big?\n\n   \"A. I only saw a shadow which appeared to me formidable.\n\n   \"Q. You cannot give us any indication?\n\n   \"A. I know nothing more, monsieur, than that a man threw himself\n        upon me and that I fired at him.  I know nothing more.\"\n\nHere the interrogation of Mademoiselle Stangerson concluded.\n\nRouletabille waited patiently for Monsieur Robert Darzac, who soon\nappeared.\n\nFrom a room near the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had heard\nthe interrogatory and now came to recount it to my friend with great\nexactitude, aided by an excellent memory. His docility still surprised\nme. Thanks to hasty pencil-notes, he was able to reproduce, almost\ntextually, the questions and the answers given.\n\nIt looked as if Monsieur Darzac were being employeeed as the secretary of\nmy young friend and acted as if he could refuse him nothing; nay, more,\nas if under a compulsion to do so.\n\nThe fact of the closed window struck the reporter as it had struck the\nmagistrate. Rouletabille asked Darzac to repeat once more Mademoiselle\nStangerson's account of how she and her father had spent their time\non the day of the tragedy, as she had stated it to the magistrate. The\ncircumstance of the dinner in the laboratory seemed to interest him in\nthe highest degree; and he had it repeated to him three times. He also\nwanted to be sure that the forest-keeper knew that the professor and his\ndaughter were going to dine in the laboratory, and how he had come to\nknow it.\n\nWhen Monsieur Darzac had finished, I said: \"The examination has not\nadvanced the problem much.\"\n\n\"It has put it back,\" said Monsieur Darzac.\n\n\"It has thrown light upon it,\" said Rouletabille, thoughtfully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Reporter and Detective\n\n\nThe three of us went back towards the pavilion. At some distance from\nthe building the reporter made us stop and, pointing to a small clump of\ntrees to the right of us, said:\n\n\"That's where the murderer came from to get into the pavilion.\"\n\nAs there were other patches of trees of the same sort between the great\noaks, I asked why the murderer had chosen that one, rather than any of\nthe others. Rouletabille answered me by pointing to the path which ran\nquite close to the thicket to the door of the pavilion.\n\n\"That path is as you see, topped with gravel,\" he said; \"the man must\nhave passed along it going to the pavilion, since no traces of his\nsteps have been found on the soft ground. The man didn't have wings;\nhe walked; but he walked on the gravel which left no impression of his\ntread. The gravel has, in fact, been trodden by many other feet, since\nthe path is the most direct way between the pavilion and the chateau.\nAs to the thicket, made of the sort of shrubs that don't flourish in the\nrough season--laurels and fuchsias--it offered the murderer a sufficient\nhiding-place until it was time for him to make his way to the pavilion.\nIt was while hiding in that clump of trees that he saw Monsieur and\nMademoiselle Stangerson, and then Daddy Jacques, leave the pavilion.\nGravel has been spread nearly, very nearly, up to the windows of the\npavilion. The footprints of a man, parallel with the wall--marks which\nwe will examine presently, and which I have already seen--prove that he\nonly needed to make one stride to find himself in front of the vestibule\nwindow, left open by Daddy Jacques. The man drew himself up by his hands\nand entered the vestibule.\"\n\n\"After all it is very possible,\" I said.\n\n\"After all what? After all what?\" cried Rouletabille.\n\nI begged of him not to be angry; but he was too much irritated to listen\nto me and declared, ironically, that he admired the prudent doubt\nwith which certain people approached the most simple problems, risking\nnothing by saying \"that is so, or 'that is not so.\" Their intelligence\nwould have produced about the same result if nature had forgotten to\nfurnish their brain-pan with a little grey matter. As I appeared vexed,\nmy young friend took me by the arm and admitted that he had not meant\nthat for me; he thought more of me than that.\n\n\"If I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel,\" he went on, \"I\nshould have to assume a balloon!--My dear fellow, the science of the\naerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to\nconsider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds! So\ndon't say a thing is possible, when it could not be otherwise. We know\nnow how the man entered by the window, and we also know the moment at\nwhich he entered,--during the five o'clock walk of the professor and his\ndaughter. The fact of the presence of the chambermaid--who had come to\nclean up The Yellow Room--in the laboratory, when Monsieur Stangerson\nand his daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one, permits\nus to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the chamber\nunder the bed, unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid. What do\nyou say, Monsieur Darzac?\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the chambermaid's\nfidelity, and that she was a thoroughly honest and devoted servant.\n\n\"Besides,\" he added, \"at five o'clock Monsieur Stangerson went into the\nroom to fetch his daughter's hat.\"\n\n\"There is that also,\" said Rouletabille.\n\n\"That the man entered by the window at the time you say, I admit,\"\nI said; \"but why did he shut the window? It was an act which would\nnecessarily draw the attention of those who had left it open.\"\n\n\"It may be the window was not shut at once,\" replied the young reporter.\n\"But if he did shut the window, it was because of the bend in the gravel\npath, a dozen yards from the pavilion, and on account of the three oaks\nthat are growing at that spot.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Monsieur Darzac, who had followed us\nand listened with almost breathless attention to all that Rouletabille\nhad said.\n\n\"I'll explain all to you later on, Monsieur, when I think the moment\nto be ripe for doing so; but I don't think I have anything of more\nimportance to say on this affair, if my hypothesis is justified.\"\n\n\"And what is your hypothesis?\"\n\n\"You will never know if it does not turn out to be the truth. It is of\nmuch too grave a nature to speak of it, so long as it continues to be\nonly a hypothesis.\"\n\n\"Have you, at least, some idea as to who the murderer is?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I don't know who the murderer is; but don't be afraid,\nMonsieur Robert Darzac--I shall know.\"\n\nI could not but observe that Monsieur Darzac was deeply moved; and I\nsuspected that Rouletabille's confident assertion was not pleasing to\nhim. Why, I asked myself, if he was really afraid that the murderer\nshould be discovered, was he helping the reporter to find him? My\nyoung friend seemed to have received the same impression, for he said,\nbluntly:\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac, don't you want me to find out who the murderer was?\"\n\n\"Oh!--I should like to kill him with my own hand!\" cried Mademoiselle\nStangerson's fiance, with a vehemence that amazed me.\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Rouletabille gravely; \"but you have not answered\nmy question.\"\n\nWe were passing by the thicket, of which the young reporter had spoken\nto us a minute before. I entered it and pointed out evident traces of a\nman who had been hidden there. Rouletabille, once more, was right.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" he said. \"We have to do with a thing of flesh and blood, who\nuses the same means that we do. It'll all come out on those lines.\"\n\nHaving said this, he asked me for the paper pattern of the footprint\nwhich he had given me to take care of, and applied it to a very clear\nfootmark behind the thicket. \"Aha!\" he said, rising.\n\nI thought he was now going to trace back the track of the murderer's\nfootmarks to the vestibule window; but he led us instead, far to the\nleft, saying that it was useless ferreting in the mud, and that he was\nsure, now, of the road taken by the murderer.\n\n\"He went along the wall to the hedge and dry ditch, over which he\njumped. See, just in front of the little path leading to the lake, that\nwas his nearest way to get out.\"\n\n\"How do you know he went to the lake?\"--\n\n\"Because Frederic Larsan has not quitted the borders of it since this\nmorning. There must be some important marks there.\"\n\nA few minutes later we reached the lake.\n\nIt was a little sheet of marshy water, surrounded by reeds, on which\nfloated some dead water-lily leaves. The great Fred may have seen us\napproaching, but we probably interested him very little, for he took\nhardly any notice of us and continued to be stirring with his cane\nsomething which we could not see.\n\n\"Look!\" said Rouletabille, \"here again are the footmarks of the escaping\nman; they skirt the lake here and finally disappear just before this\npath, which leads to the high road to Epinay. The man continued his\nflight to Paris.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\" I asked, \"since these footmarks are not\ncontinued on the path?\"\n\n\"What makes me think that?--Why these footprints, which I expected to\nfind!\" he cried, pointing to the sharply outlined imprint of a neat\nboot. \"See!\"--and he called to Frederic Larsan.\n\n\"Monsieur Fred, these neat footprints seem to have been made since the\ndiscovery of the crime.\"\n\n\"Yes, young man, yes, they have been carefully made,\" replied Fred\nwithout raising his head. \"You see, there are steps that come, and steps\nthat go back.\"\n\n\"And the man had a bicycle!\" cried the reporter.\n\nHere, after looking at the marks of the bicycle, which followed, going\nand coming, the neat footprints, I thought I might intervene.\n\n\"The bicycle explains the disappearance of the murderer's big\nfoot-prints,\" I said. \"The murderer, with his rough boots, mounted a\nbicycle. His accomplice, the wearer of the neat boots, had come to wait\nfor him on the edge of the lake with the bicycle. It might be supposed\nthat the murderer was working for the other.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" replied Rouletabille with a strange smile. \"I have expected\nto find these footmarks from the very beginning. These are not the\nfootmarks of the murderer!\"\n\n\"Then there were two?\"\n\n\"No--there was but one, and he had no accomplice.\"\n\n\"Very good!--Very good!\" cried Frederic Larsan.\n\n\"Look!\" continued the young reporter, showing us the ground where it had\nbeen disturbed by big and heavy heels; \"the man seated himself there,\nand took off his hobnailed boots, which he had worn only for the purpose\nof misleading detection, and then no doubt, taking them away with him,\nhe stood up in his own boots, and quietly and slowly regained the high\nroad, holding his bicycle in his hand, for he could not venture to ride\nit on this rough path. That accounts for the lightness of the impression\nmade by the wheels along it, in spite of the softness of the ground. If\nthere had been a man on the bicycle, the wheels would have sunk deeply\ninto the soil. No, no; there was but one man there, the murderer on\nfoot.\"\n\n\"Bravo!--bravo!\" cried Fred again, and coming suddenly towards us and,\nplanting himself in front of Monsieur Robert Darzac, he said to him:\n\n\"If we had a bicycle here, we might demonstrate the correctness of the\nyoung man's reasoning, Monsieur Robert Darzac. Do you know whether there\nis one at the chateau?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied Monsieur Darzac. \"There is not. I took mine, four days\nago, to Paris, the last time I came to the chateau before the crime.\"\n\n\"That's a pity!\" replied Fred, very coldly. Then, turning to\nRouletabille, he said: \"If we go on at this rate, we'll both come to the\nsame conclusion. Have you any idea, as to how the murderer got away from\nThe Yellow Room?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my young friend; \"I have an idea.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Fred, \"and it must be the same as yours. There are no\ntwo ways of reasoning in this affair. I am waiting for the arrival of my\nchief before offering any explanation to the examining magistrate.\"\n\n\"Ah! Is the Chief of the Surete coming?\"\n\n\"Yes, this afternoon. He is going to summon, before the magistrate, in\nthe laboratory, all those who have played any part in this tragedy. It\nwill be very interesting. It is a pity you won't be able to be present.\"\n\n\"I shall be present,\" said Rouletabille confidently.\n\n\"Really--you are an extraordinary fellow--for your age!\" replied the\ndetective in a tone not wholly free from irony. \"You'd make a wonderful\ndetective--if you had a little more method--if you didn't follow your\ninstincts and that bump on your forehead. As I have already several\ntimes observed, Monsieur Rouletabille, you reason too much; you do not\nallow yourself to be guided by what you have seen. What do you say to\nthe handkerchief full of blood, and the red mark of the hand on the\nwall? You have seen the stain on the wall, but I have only seen the\nhandkerchief.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" cried Rouletabille, \"the murderer was wounded in the hand by\nMademoiselle Stangerson's revolver!\"\n\n\"Ah!--a simply instinctive observation! Take care!--You are becoming too\nstrictly logical, Monsieur Rouletabille; logic will upset you if you\nuse it indiscriminately. You are right, when you say that Mademoiselle\nStangerson fired her revolver, but you are wrong when you say that she\nwounded the murderer in the hand.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" cried Rouletabille.\n\nFred, imperturbable, interrupted him:\n\n\"Defective observation--defective observation!--the examination of the\nhandkerchief, the numberless little round scarlet stains, the impression\nof drops which I found in the tracks of the footprints, at the moment\nwhen they were made on the floor, prove to me that the murderer was not\nwounded at all. Monsieur Rouletabille, the murderer bled at the nose!\"\n\nThe great Fred spoke quite seriously. However, I could not refrain from\nuttering an exclamation.\n\nThe reporter looked gravely at Fred, who looked gravely at him. And Fred\nimmediately concluded:\n\n\"The man allowed the blood to flow into his hand and handkerchief, and\ndried his hand on the wall. The fact is highly important,\" he added,\n\"because there is no need of his being wounded in the hand for him to be\nthe murderer.\"\n\nRouletabille seemed to be thinking deeply. After a moment he said:\n\n\"There is something--a something, Monsieur Frederic Larsan, much graver\nthan the misuse of logic the disposition of mind in some detectives\nwhich makes them, in perfect good faith, twist logic to the necessities\nof their preconceived ideas. You, already, have your idea about the\nmurderer, Monsieur Fred. Don't deny it; and your theory demands that the\nmurderer should not have been wounded in the hand, otherwise it comes\nto nothing. And you have searched, and have found something else. It's\ndangerous, very dangerous, Monsieur Fred, to go from a preconceived idea\nto find the proofs to fit it. That method may lead you far astray Beware\nof judicial error, Monsieur Fred, it will trip you up!\"\n\nAnd laughing a little, in a slightly bantering tone, his hands in his\npockets, Rouletabille fixed his cunning eyes on the great Fred.\n\nFrederic Larsan silently contemplated the young reporter who pretended\nto be as wise as himself. Shrugging his shoulders, he bowed to us and\nmoved quickly away, hitting the stones on his path with his stout cane.\n\nRouletabille watched his retreat, and then turned toward us, his face\njoyous and triumphant.\n\n\"I shall beat him!\" he cried. \"I shall beat the great Fred, clever as he\nis; I shall beat them all!\"\n\nAnd he danced a double shuffle. Suddenly he stopped. My eyes followed\nhis gaze; they were fixed on Monsieur Robert Darzac, who was looking\nanxiously at the impression left by his feet side by side with the\nelegant footmarks. There was not a particle of difference between them!\n\nWe thought he was about to faint. His eyes, bulging with terror, avoided\nus, while his right hand, with a spasmodic movement, twitched at the\nbeard that covered his honest, gentle, and now despairing face. At\nlength regaining his self-possession, he bowed to us, and remarking, in\na changed voice, that he was obliged to return to the chateau, left us.\n\n\"The deuce!\" exclaimed Rouletabille.\n\nHe, also, appeared to be deeply concerned. From his pocket-book he\ntook a piece of white paper as I had seen him do before, and with his\nscissors, cut out the shape of the neat bootmarks that were on the\nground. Then he fitted the new paper pattern with the one he had\npreviously made--the two were exactly alike. Rising, Rouletabille\nexclaimed again: \"The deuce!\" Presently he added: \"Yet I believe\nMonsieur Robert Darzac to be an honest man.\" He then led me on the road\nto the Donjon Inn, which we could see on the highway, by the side of a\nsmall clump of trees.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. \"We Shall Have to Eat Red Meat--Now\"\n\n\nThe Donjon Inn was of no imposing appearance; but I like these\nbuildings with their rafters blackened with age and the smoke of their\nhearths--these inns of the coaching-days, crumbling erections that will\nsoon exist in the memory only. They belong to the bygone days, they are\nlinked with history. They make us think of the Road, of those days when\nhighwaymen rode.\n\nI saw at once that the Donjon Inn was at least two centuries\nold--perhaps older. Under its sign-board, over the threshold, a man with\na crabbed-looking face was standing, seemingly plunged in unpleasant\nthought, if the wrinkles on his forehead and the knitting of his brows\nwere any indication.\n\nWhen we were close to him, he deigned to see us and asked us, in a tone\nanything but engaging, whether we wanted anything. He was, no doubt,\nthe not very amiable landlord of this charming dwelling-place. As we\nexpressed a hope that he would be good enough to furnish us with a\nbreakfast, he assured us that he had no provisions, regarding us, as he\nsaid this, with a look that was unmistakably suspicious.\n\n\"You may take us in,\" Rouletabille said to him, \"we are not policemen.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of the police--I'm not afraid of anyone!\" replied the\nman.\n\nI had made my friend understand by a sign that we should do better not\nto insist; but, being determined to enter the inn, he slipped by the man\non the doorstep and was in the common room.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said, \"it is very comfortable here.\"\n\nA good fire was blazing in the chimney, and we held our hands to the\nwarmth it sent out; it was a morning in which the approach of winter\nwas unmistakable. The room was a tolerably large one, furnished with two\nheavy tables, some stools, a counter decorated with rows of bottles of\nsyrup and alcohol. Three windows looked out on to the road. A coloured\nadvertisement lauded the many merits of a new vermouth. On the\nmantelpiece was arrayed the innkeeper's collection of figured\nearthenware pots and stone jugs.\n\n\"That's a fine fire for roasting a chicken,\" said Rouletabille. \"We have\nno chicken--not even a wretched rabbit,\" said the landlord.\n\n\"I know,\" said my friend slowly; \"I know--We shall have to eat red\nmeat--now.\"\n\nI confess I did not in the least understand what Rouletabille meant\nby what he had said; but the landlord, as soon as he heard the words,\nuttered an oath, which he at once stifled, and placed himself at our\norders as obediently as Monsieur Robert Darzac had done, when he heard\nRouletabille's prophetic sentence--\"The presbytery has lost nothing of\nits charm, nor the garden its brightness.\" Certainly my friend knew\nhow to make people understand him by the use of wholly incomprehensible\nphrases. I observed as much to him, but he merely smiled. I should have\nproposed that he give me some explanation; but he put a finger to his\nlips, which evidently signified that he had not only determined not to\nspeak, but also enjoined silence on my part.\n\nMeantime the man had pushed open a little side door and called to\nsomebody to bring him half a dozen eggs and a piece of beefsteak. The\ncommission was quickly executed by a strongly-built young woman with\nbeautiful blonde hair and large, handsome eyes, who regarded us with\ncuriosity.\n\nThe innkeeper said to her roughly:\n\n\"Get out!--and if the Green Man comes, don't let me see him.\"\n\nShe disappeared. Rouletabille took the eggs, which had been brought to\nhim in a bowl, and the meat which was on a dish, placed all carefully\nbeside him in the chimney, unhooked a frying-pan and a gridiron, and\nbegan to beat up our omelette before proceeding to grill our beefsteak.\nHe then ordered two bottles of cider, and seemed to take as little\nnotice of our host as our host did of him. The landlord let us do our\nown cooking and set our table near one of the windows.\n\nSuddenly I heard him mutter:\n\n\"Ah!--there he is.\"\n\nHis face had changed, expressing fierce hatred. He went and glued\nhimself to one of the windows, watching the road. There was no need for\nme to draw Rouletabille's attention; he had already left our omelette\nand had joined the landlord at the window. I went with him.\n\nA man dressed entirely in green velvet, his head covered with a\nhuntsman's cap of the same colour, was advancing leisurely, lighting\na pipe as he walked. He carried a fowling-piece slung at his back. His\nmovements displayed an almost aristocratic ease. He wore eye-glasses and\nappeared to be about five and forty years of age. His hair as well as\nhis moustache were salt grey. He was remarkably handsome. As he passed\nnear the inn, he hesitated, as if asking himself whether or no he should\nenter it; gave a glance towards us, took a few whiffs at his pipe, and\nthen resumed his walk at the same nonchalant pace.\n\nRouletabille and I looked at our host. His flashing eyes, his clenched\nhands, his trembling lips, told us of the tumultuous feelings by which\nhe was being agitated.\n\n\"He has done well not to come in here to-day!\" he hissed.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" asked Rouletabille, returning to his omelette.\n\n\"The Green Man,\" growled the innkeeper. \"Don't you know him? Then all\nthe better for you. He is not an acquaintance to make.--Well, he is\nMonsieur Stangerson's forest-keeper.\"\n\n\"You don't appear to like him very much?\" asked the reporter, pouring\nhis omelette into the frying-pan.\n\n\"Nobody likes him, monsieur. He's an upstart who must once have had a\nfortune of his own; and he forgives nobody because, in order to live, he\nhas been compelled to become a servant. A keeper is as much a servant as\nany other, isn't he? Upon my word, one would say that he is the master\nof the Glandier, and that all the land and woods belong to him. He'll\nnot let a poor creature eat a morsel of bread on the grass his grass!\"\n\n\"Does he often come here?\"\n\n\"Too often. But I've made him understand that his face doesn't please\nme, and, for a month past, he hasn't been here. The Donjon Inn has never\nexisted for him!--he hasn't had time!--been too much engaged in paying\ncourt to the landlady of the Three Lilies at Saint-Michel. A bad\nfellow!--There isn't an honest man who can bear him. Why, the concierges\nof the chateau would turn their eyes away from a picture of him!\"\n\n\"The concierges of the chateau are honest people, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are, as true as my name's Mathieu, monsieur. I believe them\nto be honest.\"\n\n\"Yet they've been arrested?\"\n\n\"What does that prove?--But I don't want to mix myself up in other\npeople's affairs.\"\n\n\"And what do you think of the murder?\"\n\n\"Of the murder of poor Mademoiselle Stangerson?--A good girl much loved\neverywhere in the country. That's what I think of it--and many things\nbesides; but that's nobody's business.\"\n\n\"Not even mine?\" insisted Rouletabille.\n\nThe innkeeper looked at him sideways and said gruffly:\n\n\"Not even yours.\"\n\nThe omelette ready, we sat down at table and were silently eating, when\nthe door was pushed open and an old woman, dressed in rags, leaning on\na stick, her head doddering, her white hair hanging loosely over her\nwrinkled forehead, appeared on the threshold.\n\n\"Ah!--there you are, Mother Angenoux!--It's long since we saw you last,\"\nsaid our host.\n\n\"I have been very ill, very nearly dying,\" said the old woman. \"If ever\nyou should have any scraps for the Bete du Bon Dieu--?\"\n\nAnd she entered, followed by a cat, larger than any I had ever believed\ncould exist. The beast looked at us and gave so hopeless a miau that I\nshuddered. I had never heard so lugubrious a cry.\n\nAs if drawn by the cat's cry a man followed the old woman in. It was the\nGreen Man. He saluted by raising his hand to his cap and seated himself\nat a table near to ours.\n\n\"A glass of cider, Daddy Mathieu,\" he said.\n\nAs the Green Man entered, Daddy Mathieu had started violently; but\nvisibly mastering himself he said:\n\n\"I've no more cider; I served the last bottles to these gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Then give me a glass of white wine,\" said the Green Man, without\nshowing the least surprise.\n\n\"I've no more white wine--no more anything,\" said Daddy Mathieu,\nsurlily.\n\n\"How is Madame Mathieu?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you.\"\n\nSo the young Woman with the large, tender eyes, whom we had just seen,\nwas the wife of this repugnant and brutal rustic, whose jealousy seemed\nto emphasise his physical ugliness.\n\nSlamming the door behind him, the innkeeper left the room. Mother\nAngenoux was still standing, leaning on her stick, the cat at her feet.\n\n\"You've been ill, Mother Angenoux?--Is that why we have not seen you for\nthe last week?\" asked the Green Man.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur keeper. I have been able to get up but three times, to\ngo to pray to Sainte-Genevieve, our good patroness, and the rest of the\ntime I have been lying on my bed. There was no one to care for me but\nthe Bete du bon Dieu!\"\n\n\"Did she not leave you?\"\n\n\"Neither by day nor by night.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\n\n\"As I am of Paradise.\"\n\n\"Then how was it, Madame Angenoux, that all through the night of the\nmurder nothing but the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu was heard?\"\n\nMother Angenoux planted herself in front of the forest-keeper and struck\nthe floor with her stick.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" she said. \"But shall I tell you\nsomething? There are no two cats in the world that cry like that. Well,\non the night of the murder I also heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu\noutside; and yet she was on my knees, and did not mew once, I swear. I\ncrossed myself when I heard that, as if I had heard the devil.\"\n\nI looked at the keeper when he put the last question, and I am much\nmistaken if I did not detect an evil smile on his lips. At that moment,\nthe noise of loud quarrelling reached us. We even thought we heard a\ndull sound of blows, as if some one was being beaten. The Green Man\nquickly rose and hurried to the door by the side of the fireplace; but\nit was opened by the landlord who appeared, and said to the keeper:\n\n\"Don't alarm yourself, Monsieur--it is my wife; she has the toothache.\"\nAnd he laughed. \"Here, Mother Angenoux, here are some scraps for your\ncat.\"\n\nHe held out a packet to the old woman, who took it eagerly and went out\nby the door, closely followed by her cat.\n\n\"Then you won't serve me?\" asked the Green Man.\n\nDaddy Mathieu's face was placid and no longer retained its expression of\nhatred.\n\n\"I've nothing for you--nothing for you. Take yourself off.\"\n\nThe Green Man quietly refilled his pipe, lit it, bowed to us, and went\nout. No sooner was he over the threshold than Daddy Mathieu slammed\nthe door after him and, turning towards us, with eyes bloodshot, and\nfrothing at the mouth, he hissed to us, shaking his clenched fist at the\ndoor he had just shut on the man he evidently hated:\n\n\"I don't know who you are who tell me 'We shall have to eat red\nmeat--now'; but if it will interest you to know it--that man is the\nmurderer!\"\n\nWith which words Daddy Mathieu immediately left us. Rouletabille\nreturned towards the fireplace and said:\n\n\"Now we'll grill our steak. How do you like the cider?--It's a little\ntart, but I like it.\"\n\nWe saw no more of Daddy Mathieu that day, and absolute silence reigned\nin the inn when we left it, after placing five francs on the table in\npayment for our feast.\n\nRouletabille at once set off on a three mile walk round Professor\nStangerson's estate. He halted for some ten minutes at the corner of a\nnarrow road black with soot, near to some charcoal-burners' huts in the\nforest of Sainte-Genevieve, which touches on the road from Epinay to\nCorbeil, to tell me that the murderer had certainly passed that way,\nbefore entering the grounds and concealing himself in the little clump\nof trees.\n\n\"You don't think, then, that the keeper knows anything of it?\" I asked.\n\n\"We shall see that, later,\" he replied. \"For the present I'm not\ninterested in what the landlord said about the man. The landlord hates\nhim. I didn't take you to breakfast at the Donjon Inn for the sake of\nthe Green Man.\"\n\nThen Rouletabille, with great precaution glided, followed by me, towards\nthe little building which, standing near the park gate, served for the\nhome of the concierges, who had been arrested that morning. With the\nskill of an acrobat, he got into the lodge by an upper window which had\nbeen left open, and returned ten minutes later. He said only, \"Ah!\"--a\nword which, in his mouth, signified many things.\n\nWe were about to take the road leading to the chateau, when a\nconsiderable stir at the park gate attracted our attention. A carriage\nhad arrived and some people had come from the chateau to meet it.\nRouletabille pointed out to me a gentleman who descended from it.\n\n\"That's the Chief of the Surete\" he said. \"Now we shall see what\nFrederic Larsan has up his sleeve, and whether he is so much cleverer\nthan anybody else.\"\n\nThe carriage of the Chief of the Surete was followed by three other\nvehicles containing reporters, who were also desirous of entering the\npark. But two gendarmes stationed at the gate had evidently received\norders to refuse admission to anybody. The Chief of the Surete calmed\ntheir impatience by undertaking to furnish to the press, that evening,\nall the information he could give that would not interfere with the\njudicial inquiry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. In Which Frederic Larsan Explains How the Murderer Was Able\nto Get Out of The Yellow Room\n\n\nAmong the mass of papers, legal documents, memoirs, and extracts from\nnewspapers, which I have collected, relating to the mystery of The\nYellow Room, there is one very interesting piece; it is a detail of the\nfamous examination which took place that afternoon, in the laboratory of\nProfessor Stangerson, before the Chief of the Surete. This narrative is\nfrom the pen of Monsieur Maleine, the Registrar, who, like the examining\nmagistrate, had spent some of his leisure time in the pursuit of\nliterature. The piece was to have made part of a book which, however,\nhas never been published, and which was to have been entitled: \"My\nExaminations.\" It was given to me by the Registrar himself, some time\nafter the astonishing denouement to this case, and is unique in judicial\nchronicles.\n\nHere it is. It is not a mere dry transcription of questions and answers,\nbecause the Registrar often intersperses his story with his own personal\ncomments.\n\n\n                     THE REGISTRAR'S NARRATIVE\n\nThe examining magistrate and I (the writer relates) found ourselves in\nThe Yellow Room in the company of the builder who had constructed the\npavilion after Professor Stangerson's designs. He had a workman with\nhim. Monsieur de Marquet had had the walls laid entirely bare; that is\nto say, he had had them stripped of the paper which had decorated them.\nBlows with a pick, here and there, satisfied us of the absence of any\nsort of opening. The floor and the ceiling were thoroughly sounded.\nWe found nothing. There was nothing to be found. Monsieur de Marquet\nappeared to be delighted and never ceased repeating:\n\n\"What a case! What a case! We shall never know, you'll see, how the\nmurderer was able to get out of this room!\"\n\nThen suddenly, with a radiant face, he called to the officer in charge\nof the gendarmes.\n\n\"Go to the chateau,\" he said, \"and request Monsieur Stangerson and\nMonsieur Robert Darzac to come to me in the laboratory, also Daddy\nJacques; and let your men bring here the two concierges.\"\n\nFive minutes later all were assembled in the laboratory. The Chief of\nthe Surete, who had arrived at the Glandier, joined us at that moment.\nI was seated at Monsieur Stangerson's desk ready for work, when Monsieur\nde Marquet made us the following little speech--as original as it was\nunexpected:\n\n\"With your permission, gentlemen--as examinations lead to nothing--we\nwill, for once, abandon the old system of interrogation. I will not\nhave you brought before me one by one, but we will all remain here as we\nare,--Monsieur Stangerson, Monsieur Robert Darzac, Daddy Jacques and the\ntwo concierges, the Chief of the Surete, the Registrar, and myself. We\nshall all be on the same footing. The concierges may, for the moment,\nforget that they have been arrested. We are going to confer together. We\nare on the spot where the crime was committed. We have nothing else to\ndiscuss but the crime. So let us discuss it freely--intelligently or\notherwise, so long as we speak just what is in our minds. There need be\nno formality or method since this won't help us in any way.\"\n\nThen, passing before me, he said in a low voice:\n\n\"What do you think of that, eh? What a scene! Could you have thought\nof that? I'll make a little piece out of it for the Vaudeville.\" And he\nrubbed his hands with glee.\n\nI turned my eyes on Monsieur Stangerson. The hope he had received from\nthe doctor's latest reports, which stated that Mademoiselle Stangerson\nmight recover from her wounds, had not been able to efface from his\nnoble features the marks of the great sorrow that was upon him. He\nhad believed his daughter to be dead, and he was still broken by that\nbelief. His clear, soft, blue eyes expressed infinite sorrow. I had had\noccasion, many times, to see Monsieur Stangerson at public ceremonies,\nand from the first had been struck by his countenance, which seemed as\npure as that of a child--the dreamy gaze with the sublime and mystical\nexpression of the inventor and thinker.\n\nOn those occasions his daughter was always to be seen either following\nhim or by his side; for they never quitted each other, it was said, and\nhad shared the same labours for many years. The young lady, who was\nthen five and thirty, though she looked no more than thirty, had devoted\nherself entirely to science. She still won admiration for her imperial\nbeauty which had remained intact, without a wrinkle, withstanding time\nand love. Who would have dreamed that I should one day be seated by her\npillow with my papers, and that I should see her, on the point of death,\npainfully recounting to us the most monstrous and most mysterious crime\nI have heard of in my career? Who would have thought that I should be,\nthat afternoon, listening to the despairing father vainly trying to\nexplain how his daughter's assailant had been able to escape from him?\nWhy bury ourselves with our work in obscure retreats in the depths of\nwoods, if it may not protect us against those dangerous threats to life\nwhich meet us in the busy cities?\n\n\"Now, Monsieur Stangerson,\" said Monsieur de Marquet, with somewhat\nof an important air, \"place yourself exactly where you were when\nMademoiselle Stangerson left you to go to her chamber.\"\n\nMonsieur Stangerson rose and, standing at a certain distance from the\ndoor of The Yellow Room, said, in an even voice and without the least\ntrace of emphasis--a voice which I can only describe as a dead voice:\n\n\"I was here. About eleven o'clock, after I had made a brief chemical\nexperiment at the furnaces of the laboratory, needing all the space\nbehind me, I had my desk moved here by Daddy Jacques, who spent the\nevening in cleaning some of my apparatus. My daughter had been working\nat the same desk with me. When it was her time to leave she rose, kissed\nme, and bade Daddy Jacques goodnight. She had to pass behind my desk\nand the door to enter her chamber, and she could do this only with some\ndifficulty. That is to say, I was very near the place where the crime\noccurred later.\"\n\n\"And the desk?\" I asked, obeying, in thus mixing myself in the\nconversation, the express orders of my chief, \"as soon as you heard\nthe cry of 'murder' followed by the revolver shots, what became of the\ndesk?\"\n\nDaddy Jacques answered.\n\n\"We pushed it back against the wall, here--close to where it is at the\npresent moment-so as to be able to get at the door at once.\"\n\nI followed up my reasoning, to which, however, I attached but little\nimportance, regarding it as only a weak hypothesis, with another\nquestion.\n\n\"Might not a man in the room, the desk being so near to the door, by\nstooping and slipping under the desk, have left it unobserved?\"\n\n\"You are forgetting,\" interrupted Monsieur Stangerson wearily, \"that\nmy daughter had locked and bolted her door, that the door had remained\nfastened, that we vainly tried to force it open when we heard the noise,\nand that we were at the door while the struggle between the murderer and\nmy poor child was going on--immediately after we heard her stifled cries\nas she was being held by the fingers that have left their red mark\nupon her throat. Rapid as the attack was, we were no less rapid in our\nendeavors to get into the room where the tragedy was taking place.\"\n\nI rose from my seat and once more examined the door with the greatest\ncare. Then I returned to my place with a despairing gesture.\n\n\"If the lower panel of the door,\" I said, \"could be removed without the\nwhole door being necessarily opened, the problem would be solved. But,\nunfortunately, that last hypothesis is untenable after an examination\nof the door--it's of oak, solid and massive. You can see that quite\nplainly, in spite of the injury done in the attempt to burst it open.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Daddy Jacques, \"it is an old and solid door that was brought\nfrom the chateau--they don't make such doors now. We had to use this bar\nof iron to get it open, all four of us--for the concierge, brave woman\nshe is, helped us. It pains me to find them both in prison now.\"\n\nDaddy Jacques had no sooner uttered these words of pity and protestation\nthan tears and lamentations broke out from the concierges. I never saw\ntwo accused people crying more bitterly. I was extremely disgusted. Even\nif they were innocent, I could not understand how they could behave like\nthat in the face of misfortune. A dignified bearing at such times is\nbetter than tears and groans, which, most often, are feigned.\n\n\"Now then, enough of that sniveling,\" cried Monsieur de Marquet; \"and,\nin your interest, tell us what you were doing under the windows of the\npavilion at the time your mistress was being attacked; for you were\nclose to the pavilion when Daddy Jacques met you.\"\n\n\"We were coming to help!\" they whined.\n\n\"If we could only lay hands on the murderer, he'd never taste bread\nagain!\" the woman gurgled between her sobs.\n\nAs before we were unable to get two connecting thoughts out of them.\nThey persisted in their denials and swore, by heaven and all the saints,\nthat they were in bed when they heard the sound of the revolver shot.\n\n\"It was not one, but two shots that were fired!--You see, you are lying.\nIf you had heard one, you would have heard the other.\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Monsieur--it was the second shot we heard. We were asleep\nwhen the first shot was fired.\"\n\n\"Two shots were fired,\" said Daddy Jacques. \"I am certain that all the\ncartridges were in my revolver. We found afterward that two had been\nexploded, and we heard two shots behind the door. Was not that so,\nMonsieur Stangerson?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, \"there were two shots, one dull, and the\nother sharp and ringing.\"\n\n\"Why do you persist in lying?\" cried Monsieur de Marquet, turning to the\nconcierges. \"Do you think the police are the fools you are? Everything\npoints to the fact that you were out of doors and near the pavilion\nat the time of the tragedy. What were you doing there? So far as I am\nconcerned,\" he said, turning to Monsieur Stangerson, \"I can only explain\nthe escape of the murderer on the assumption of help from these two\naccomplices. As soon as the door was forced open, and while you,\nMonsieur Stangerson, were occupied with your unfortunate child, the\nconcierge and his wife facilitated the flight of the murderer, who,\nscreening himself behind them, reached the window in the vestibule, and\nsprang out of it into the park. The concierge closed the window after\nhim and fastened the blinds, which certainly could not have closed and\nfastened of themselves. That is the conclusion I have arrived at. If\nanyone here has any other idea, let him state it.\"\n\nMonsieur Stangerson intervened:\n\n\"What you say was impossible. I do not believe either in the guilt or\nin the connivance of my concierges, though I cannot understand what\nthey were doing in the park at that late hour of the night. I say it was\nimpossible, because Madame Bernier held the lamp and did not move from\nthe threshold of the room; because I, as soon as the door was forced\nopen, threw myself on my knees beside my daughter, and no one could have\nleft or entered the room by the door, without passing over her body and\nforcing his way by me! Daddy Jacques and the concierge had but to cast\na glance round the chamber and under the bed, as I had done on entering,\nto see that there was nobody in it but my daughter lying on the floor.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Monsieur Darzac?\" asked the magistrate.\n\nMonsieur Darzac replied that he had no opinion to express. Monsieur Dax,\nthe Chief of the Surete who, so far, had been listening and examining\nthe room, at length deigned to open his lips:\n\n\"While search is being made for the criminal, we had better try to find\nout the motive for the crime; that will advance us a little,\" he\nsaid. Turning towards Monsieur Stangerson, he continued, in the even,\nintelligent tone indicative of a strong character, \"I understand that\nMademoiselle was shortly to have been married?\"\n\nThe professor looked sadly at Monsieur Robert Darzac.\n\n\"To my friend here, whom I should have been happy to call my son--to\nMonsieur Robert Darzac.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson is much better and is rapidly recovering\nfrom her wounds. The marriage is simply delayed, is it not, Monsieur?\"\ninsisted the Chief of the Surete.\n\n\"I hope so.\n\n\"What! Is there any doubt about that?\"\n\nMonsieur Stangerson did not answer. Monsieur Robert Darzac seemed\nagitated. I saw that his hand trembled as it fingered his watchchain.\nMonsieur Dax coughed, as did Monsieur de Marquet. Both were evidently\nembarrassed.\n\n\"You understand, Monsieur Stangerson,\" he said, \"that in an affair so\nperplexing as this, we cannot neglect anything; we must know all,\neven the smallest and seemingly most futile thing concerning the\nvictim--information apparently the most insignificant. Why do you doubt\nthat this marriage will take place? You expressed a hope; but the hope\nimplies a doubt. Why do you doubt?\"\n\nMonsieur Stangerson made a visible effort to recover himself.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur,\" he said at length, \"you are right. It will be best that\nyou should know something which, if I concealed it, might appear to be\nof importance; Monsieur Darzac agrees with me in this.\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac, whose pallor at that moment seemed to me to be\naltogether abnormal, made a sign of assent. I gathered he was unable to\nspeak.\n\n\"I want you to know then,\" continued Monsieur Stangerson, \"that my\ndaughter has sworn never to leave me, and adheres firmly to her oath,\nin spite of all my prayers and all that I have argued to induce her\nto marry. We have known Monsieur Robert Darzac many years. He loves\nmy child; and I believed that she loved him; because she only recently\nconsented to this marriage which I desire with all my heart. I am an old\nman, Monsieur, and it was a happy hour to me when I knew that, after I\nhad gone, she would have at her side, one who loved her and who would\nhelp her in continuing our common labours. I love and esteem Monsieur\nDarzac both for his greatness of heart and for his devotion to science.\nBut, two days before the tragedy, for I know not what reason, my\ndaughter declared to me that she would never marry Monsieur Darzac.\"\n\nA dead silence followed Monsieur Stangerson's words. It was a moment\nfraught with suspense.\n\n\"Did Mademoiselle give you any explanation,--did she tell you what her\nmotive was?\" asked Monsieur Dax.\n\n\"She told me she was too old to marry--that she had waited too long. She\nsaid she had given much thought to the matter and while she had a great\nesteem, even affection, for Monsieur Darzac, she felt it would be better\nif things remained as they were. She would be happy, she said, to see\nthe relations between ourselves and Monsieur Darzac become closer, but\nonly on the understanding that there would be no more talk of marriage.\"\n\n\"That is very strange!\" muttered Monsieur Dax.\n\n\"Strange!\" repeated Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"You'll certainly not find the motive there, Monsieur Dax,\" Monsieur\nStangerson said with a cold smile.\n\n\"In any case, the motive was not theft!\" said the Chief impatiently.\n\n\"Oh! we are quite convinced of that!\" cried the examining magistrate.\n\nAt that moment the door of the laboratory opened and the officer in\ncharge of the gendarmes entered and handed a card to the examining\nmagistrate. Monsieur de Marquet read it and uttered a half angry\nexclamation:\n\n\"This is really too much!\" he cried.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the Chief.\n\n\"It's the card of a young reporter engaged on the 'Epoque,' a Monsieur\nJoseph Rouletabille. It has these words written on it: 'One of the\nmotives of the crime was robbery.'\"\n\nThe Chief smiled.\n\n\"Ah,--young Rouletabille--I've heard of him he is considered rather\nclever. Let him come in.\"\n\nMonsieur Joseph Rouletabille was allowed to enter. I had made his\nacquaintance in the train that morning on the way to Epinay-sur-Orge.\nHe had introduced himself almost against my wish into our compartment. I\nhad better say at once that his manners, and the arrogance with which\nhe assumed to know what was incomprehensible even to us, impressed him\nunfavourably on my mind. I do not like journalists. They are a class\nof writers to be avoided as the pest. They think that everything is\npermissible and they respect nothing. Grant them the least favour, allow\nthem even to approach you, and you never can tell what annoyance they\nmay give you. This one appears to be scarcely twenty years old, and the\neffrontery with which he dared to question us and discuss the matter\nwith us made him particularly obnoxious to me. Besides, he had a way of\nexpressing himself that left us guessing as to whether he was mocking us\nor not. I know quite well that the 'Epoque' is an influential paper with\nwhich it is well to be on good terms, but the paper ought not to allow\nitself to be represented by sneaking reporters.\n\nMonsieur Joseph Rouletabille entered the laboratory, bowed to us, and\nwaited for Monsieur de Marquet to ask him to explain his presence.\n\n\"You pretend, Monsieur, that you know the motive for the crime, and\nthat that motive--in the face of all the evidence that has been\nforthcoming--was robbery?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur, I do not pretend that. I do not say that robbery was the\nmotive for the crime, and I don't believe it was.\"\n\n\"Then, what is the meaning of this card?\"\n\n\"It means that robbery was one of the motives for the crime.\"\n\n\"What leads you to think that?\"\n\n\"If you will be good enough to accompany me, I will show you.\"\n\nThe young man asked us to follow him into the vestibule, and we did.\nHe led us towards the lavatory and begged Monsieur de Marquet to kneel\nbeside him. This lavatory is lit by the glass door, and, when the\ndoor was open, the light which penetrated was sufficient to light it\nperfectly. Monsieur de Marquet and Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille knelt\ndown on the threshold, and the young man pointed to a spot on the\npavement.\n\n\"The stones of the lavatory have not been washed by Daddy Jacques for\nsome time,\" he said; \"that can be seen by the layer of dust that covers\nthem. Now, notice here, the marks of two large footprints and the black\nash they left where they have been. That ash is nothing else than the\ncharcoal dust that covers the path along which you must pass through the\nforest, in order to get directly from Epinay to the Glandier. You know\nthere is a little village of charcoal-burners at that place, who make\nlarge quantities of charcoal. What the murderer did was to come here at\nmidday, when there was nobody at the pavilion, and attempt his robbery.\"\n\n\"But what robbery?--Where do you see any signs of robbery? What proves\nto you that a robbery has been committed?\" we all cried at once. \"What\nput me on the trace of it,\" continued the journalist...\n\n\"Was this?\" interrupted Monsieur de Marquet, still on his knees.\n\n\"Evidently,\" said Rouletabille.\n\nAnd Monsieur de Marquet explained that there were on the dust of\nthe pavement marks of two footsteps, as well as the impression,\nfreshly-made, of a heavy rectangular parcel, the marks of the cord with\nwhich it had been fastened being easily distinguished.\n\n\"You have been here, then, Monsieur Rouletabille? I thought I had given\norders to Daddy Jacques, who Was left in charge of the pavilion, not to\nallow anybody to enter.\"\n\n\"Don't scold Daddy Jacques, I came here with Monsieur Robert Darzac.\"\n\n\"Ah,--Indeed!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Marquet, disagreeably, casting a\nside-glance at Monsieur Darzac, who remained perfectly silent.\n\n\"When I saw the mark of the parcel by the side of the footprints, I had\nno doubt as to the robbery,\" replied Monsieur Rouletabille. \"The thief\nhad not brought a parcel with him; he had made one here--a parcel with\nthe stolen objects, no doubt; and he put it in this corner intending\nto take it away when the moment came for him to make his escape. He had\nalso placed his heavy boots beside the parcel,--for, see--there are no\nmarks of steps leading to the marks left by the boots, which were placed\nside by side. That accounts for the fact that the murderer left no\ntrace of his steps when he fled from The Yellow Room, nor any in the\nlaboratory, nor in the vestibule. After entering The Yellow Room in his\nboots, he took them off, finding them troublesome, or because he wished\nto make as little noise as possible. The marks made by him in going\nthrough the vestibule and the laboratory were subsequently washed out\nby Daddy Jacques. Having, for some reason or other, taken off his boots,\nthe murderer carried them in his hand and placed them by the side of the\nparcel he had made,--by that time the robbery had been accomplished. The\nman then returned to The Yellow Room and slipped under the bed, where\nthe mark of his body is perfectly visible on the floor and even on the\nmat, which has been slightly moved from its place and creased. Fragments\nof straw also, recently torn, bear witness to the murderer's movements\nunder the bed.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,--we know all about that,\" said Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"The robber had another motive for returning to hide under the bed,\"\ncontinued the astonishing boy-journalist. \"You might think that he was\ntrying to hide himself quickly on seeing, through the vestibule window,\nMonsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson about to enter the pavilion. It\nwould have been much easier for him to have climbed up to the attic and\nhidden there, waiting for an opportunity to get away, if his purpose had\nbeen only flight.--No! No!--he had to be in The Yellow Room.\"\n\nHere the Chief intervened.\n\n\"That's not at all bad, young man. I compliment you. If we do not know\nyet how the murderer succeeded in getting away, we can at any rate see\nhow he came in and committed the robbery. But what did he steal?\"\n\n\"Something very valuable,\" replied the young reporter.\n\nAt that moment we heard a cry from the laboratory. We rushed in and\nfound Monsieur Stangerson, his eyes haggard, his limbs trembling,\npointing to a sort of bookcase which he had opened, and which, we saw,\nwas empty. At the same instant he sank into the large armchair that was\nplaced before the desk and groaned, the tears rolling down his cheeks,\n\"I have been robbed again! For God's sake, do not say a word of this to\nmy daughter. She would be more pained than I am.\" He heaved a deep sigh\nand added, in a tone I shall never forget: \"After all, what does it\nmatter,--so long as she lives!\"\n\n\"She will live!\" said Monsieur Darzac, in a voice strangely touching.\n\n\"And we will find the stolen articles,\" said Monsieur Dax. \"But what was\nin the cabinet?\"\n\n\"Twenty years of my life,\" replied the illustrious professor sadly, \"or\nrather of our lives--the lives of myself and my daughter! Yes, our\nmost precious documents, the records of our secret experiments and our\nlabours of twenty years were in that cabinet. It is an irreparable loss\nto us and, I venture to say, to science. All the processes by which I\nhad been able to arrive at the precious proof of the destructibility of\nmatter were there--all. The man who came wished to take all from me,--my\ndaughter and my work--my heart and my soul.\"\n\nAnd the great scientist wept like a child.\n\nWe stood around him in silence, deeply affected by his great distress.\nMonsieur Darzac pressed closely to his side, and tried in vain to\nrestrain his tears--a sight which, for the moment, almost made me like\nhim, in spite of an instinctive repulsion which his strange demeanour\nand his inexplicable anxiety had inspired me.\n\nMonsieur Rouletabille alone,--as if his precious time and mission\non earth did not permit him to dwell in the contemplation on human\nsuffering--had, very calmly, stepped up to the empty cabinet and,\npointing at it, broke the almost solemn silence. He entered into\nexplanations, for which there was no need, as to why he had been led\nto believe that a robbery had been committed, which included the\nsimultaneous discovery he had made in the lavatory, and the empty\nprecious cabinet in the laboratory. The first thing that had struck him,\nhe said, was the unusual form of that piece of furniture. It was very\nstrongly built of fire-proof iron, clearly showing that it was intended\nfor the keeping of most valuable objects. Then he noticed that the key\nhad been left in the lock. \"One does not ordinarily have a safe and\nleave it open!\" he had said to himself. This little key, with its brass\nhead and complicated wards, had strongly attracted him,--its presence\nhad suggested robbery.\n\nMonsieur de Marquet appeared to be greatly perplexed, as if he did\nnot know whether he ought to be glad of the new direction given to the\ninquiry by the young reporter, or sorry that it had not been done by\nhimself. In our profession and for the general welfare, we have to put\nup with such mortifications and bury selfish feelings. That was why\nMonsieur de Marquet controlled himself and joined his compliments with\nthose of Monsieur Dax. As for Monsieur Rouletabille, he simply shrugged\nhis shoulders and said: \"There's nothing at all in that!\" I should have\nliked to box his ears, especially when he added: \"You will do well,\nMonsieur, to ask Monsieur Stangerson who usually kept that key?\"\n\n\"My daughter,\" replied Monsieur Stangerson, \"she was never without it.\n\n\"Ah! then that changes the aspect of things which no longer corresponds\nwith Monsieur Rouletabille's ideas!\" cried Monsieur de Marquet. \"If that\nkey never left Mademoiselle Stangerson, the murderer must have waited\nfor her in her room for the purpose of stealing it; and the robbery\ncould not have been committed until after the attack had been made on\nher. But after the attack four persons were in the laboratory! I can't\nmake it out!\"\n\n\"The robbery,\" said the reporter, \"could only have been committed before\nthe attack upon Mademoiselle Stangerson in her room. When the murderer\nentered the pavilion he already possessed the brass-headed key.\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" said Monsieur Stangerson in a low voice.\n\n\"It is quite possible, Monsieur, as this proves.\"\n\nAnd the young rascal drew a copy of the \"Epoque\" from his pocket, dated\nthe 21st of October (I recall the fact that the crime was committed on\nthe night between the 24th and 25th), and showing us an advertisement,\nhe read:\n\n\"'Yesterday a black satin reticule was lost in the Grands Magasins de\nla Louvre. It contained, amongst other things, a small key with a brass\nhead. A handsome reward will be given to the person who has found it.\nThis person must write, poste restante, bureau 40, to this address: M.\nA. T. H. S. N.' Do not these letters suggest Mademoiselle Stangerson?\"\ncontinued the reporter. \"The 'key with a brass head'--is not this\nthe key? I always read advertisements. In my business, as in yours,\nMonsieur, one should always read the personals.' They are often the keys\nto intrigues, that are not always brass-headed, but which are none the\nless interesting. This advertisement interested me specially; the woman\nof the key surrounded it with a kind of mystery. Evidently she valued\nthe key, since she promised a big reward for its restoration! And I\nthought on these six letters: M. A. T. H. S. N. The first four at once\npointed to a Christian name; evidently I said Math is Mathilde. But I\ncould make nothing of the two last letters. So I threw the journal\naside and occupied myself with other matters. Four days later, when the\nevening paper appeared with enormous head-lines announcing the murder of\nMademoiselle Stangerson, the letters in the advertisement mechanically\nrecurred to me. I had forgotten the two last letters, S. N. When I saw\nthem again I could not help exclaiming, 'Stangerson!' I jumped into\na cab and rushed into the bureau No. 40, asking: 'Have you a letter\naddressed to M. A. T. H. S. N.?' The clerk replied that he had not. I\ninsisted, begged and entreated him to search. He wanted to know if I\nwere playing a joke on him, and then told me that he had had a letter\nwith the initials M. A. T. H. S. N, but he had given it up three days\nago, to a lady who came for it. 'You come to-day to claim the letter,\nand the day before yesterday another gentleman claimed it! I've had\nenough of this,' he concluded angrily. I tried to question him as to the\ntwo persons who had already claimed the letter; but whether he wished to\nentrench himself behind professional secrecy,--he may have thought that\nhe had already said too much,--or whether he was disgusted at the joke\nthat had been played on him--he would not answer any of my questions.\"\n\nRouletabille paused. We all remained silent. Each drew his own\nconclusions from the strange story of the poste restante letter. It\nseemed, indeed, that we now had a thread by means of which we should be\nable to follow up this extraordinary mystery.\n\n\"Then it is almost certain,\" said Monsieur Stangerson, \"that my daughter\ndid lose the key, and that she did not tell me of it, wishing to spare\nany anxiety, and that she begged whoever had found it to write to\nthe poste restante. She evidently feared that, by giving our address,\ninquiries would have resulted that would have apprised me of the loss of\nthe key. It was quite logical, quite natural for her to have taken that\ncourse--for I have been robbed once before.\"\n\n\"Where was that, and when?\" asked the Chief of the Surete.\n\n\"Oh! many years ago, in America, in Philadelphia. There were stolen from\nmy laboratory the drawings of two inventions that might have made the\nfortune of a man. Not only have I never learnt who the thief was, but\nI have never heard even a word of the object of the robbery, doubtless\nbecause, in order to defeat the plans of the person who had robbed me,\nI myself brought these two inventions before the public, and so rendered\nthe robbery of no avail. From that time on I have been very careful to\nshut myself in when I am at work. The bars to these windows, the\nlonely situation of this pavilion, this cabinet, which I had specially\nconstructed, this special lock, this unique key, all are precautions\nagainst fears inspired by a sad experience.\"\n\n\"Most interesting!\" remarked Monsieur Dax.\n\nMonsieur Rouletabille asked about the reticule. Neither Monsieur\nStangerson nor Daddy Jacques had seen it for several days, but a few\nhours later we learned from Mademoiselle Stangerson herself that the\nreticule had either been stolen from her, or she had lost it. She\nfurther corroborated all that had passed just as her father had stated.\nShe had gone to the poste restante and, on the 23rd of October, had\nreceived a letter which, she affirmed, contained nothing but a vulgar\npleasantry, which she had immediately burned.\n\nTo return to our examination, or rather to our conversation. I\nmust state that the Chief of the Surete having inquired of Monsieur\nStangerson under what conditions his daughter had gone to Paris on the\n20th of October, we learned that Monsieur Robert Darzac had accompanied\nher, and Darzac had not been again seen at the chateau from that time\nto the day after the crime had been committed. The fact that Monsieur\nDarzac was with her in the Grands Magasins de la Louvre when the\nreticule disappeared could not pass unnoticed, and, it must be said,\nstrongly awakened our interest.\n\nThis conversation between magistrates, accused, victim, witnesses and\njournalist, was coming to a close when quite a theatrical sensation--an\nincident of a kind displeasing to Monsieur de Marquet--was produced. The\nofficer of the gendarmes came to announce that Frederic Larsan requested\nto be admitted,--a request that was at once complied with. He held in\nhis hand a heavy pair of muddy boots, which he threw on the pavement of\nthe laboratory.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, \"are the boots worn by the murderer. Do you recognise\nthem, Daddy Jacques?\"\n\nDaddy Jacques bent over them and, stupefied, recognised a pair of old\nboots which he had, some time back, thrown into a corner of his attic.\nHe was so taken aback that he could not hide his agitation.\n\nThen pointing to the handkerchief in the old man's hand, Frederic Larsan\nsaid:\n\n\"That's a handkerchief astonishingly like the one found in The Yellow\nRoom.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Daddy Jacques, trembling, \"they are almost alike.\"\n\n\"And then,\" continued Frederic Larsan, \"the old Basque cap also found\nin The Yellow Room might at one time have been worn by Daddy Jacques\nhimself. All this, gentlemen, proves, I think, that the murderer wished\nto disguise his real personality. He did it in a very clumsy way--or,\nat least, so it appears to us. Don't be alarmed, Daddy Jacques; we are\nquite sure that you were not the murderer; you never left the side of\nMonsieur Stangerson. But if Monsieur Stangerson had not been working\nthat night and had gone back to the chateau after parting with his\ndaughter, and Daddy Jacques had gone to sleep in his attic, no one would\nhave doubted that he was the murderer. He owes his safety, therefore, to\nthe tragedy having been enacted too soon,--the murderer, no doubt, from\nthe silence in the laboratory, imagined that it was empty, and that\nthe moment for action had come. The man who had been able to introduce\nhimself here so mysteriously and to leave so many evidences against\nDaddy Jacques, was, there can be no doubt, familiar with the house.\nAt what hour exactly he entered, whether in the afternoon or in the\nevening, I cannot say. One familiar with the proceedings and persons of\nthis pavilion could choose his own time for entering The Yellow Room.\"\n\n\"He could not have entered it if anybody had been in the laboratory,\"\nsaid Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"How do we know that?\" replied Larsan. \"There was the dinner in the\nlaboratory, the coming and going of the servants in attendance. There\nwas a chemical experiment being carried on between ten and eleven\no'clock, with Monsieur Stangerson, his daughter, and Daddy Jacques\nengaged at the furnace in a corner of the high chimney. Who can say that\nthe murderer--an intimate!--a friend!--did not take advantage of that\nmoment to slip into The Yellow Room, after having taken off his boots in\nthe lavatory?\"\n\n\"It is very improbable,\" said Monsieur Stangerson.\n\n\"Doubtless--but it is not impossible. I assert nothing. As to the escape\nfrom the pavilion--that's another thing, the most natural thing in the\nworld.\"\n\nFor a moment Frederic Larsan paused,--a moment that appeared to us a\nvery long time. The eagerness with which we awaited what he was going to\ntell us may be imagined.\n\n\"I have not been in The Yellow Room,\" he continued, \"but I take it for\ngranted that you have satisfied yourselves that he could have left the\nroom only by way of the door; it is by the door, then, that the murderer\nmade his way out. At what time? At the moment when it was most easy\nfor him to do so; at the moment when it became most explainable--so\ncompletely explainable that there can be no other explanation. Let us\ngo over the moments which followed after the crime had been committed.\nThere was the first moment, when Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques\nwere close to the door, ready to bar the way. There was the second\nmoment, during which Daddy Jacques was absent and Monsieur Stangerson\nwas left alone before the door. There was a third moment, when Monsieur\nStangerson was joined by the concierge. There was a fourth moment,\nduring which Monsieur Stangerson, the concierge and his wife and Daddy\nJacques were before the door. There was a fifth moment, during which the\ndoor was burst open and The Yellow Room entered. The moment at which the\nflight is explainable is the very moment when there was the least number\nof persons before the door. There was one moment when there was but one\nperson,--Monsieur Stangerson. Unless a complicity of silence on the part\nof Daddy Jacques is admitted--in which I do not believe--the door was\nopened in the presence of Monsieur Stangerson alone and the man escaped.\n\n\"Here we must admit that Monsieur Stangerson had powerful reasons for\nnot arresting, or not causing the arrest of the murderer, since he\nallowed him to reach the window in the vestibule and closed it after\nhim!--That done, Mademoiselle Stangerson, though horribly wounded, had\nstill strength enough, and no doubt in obedience to the entreaties of\nher father, to refasten the door of her chamber, with both the bolt and\nthe lock, before sinking on the floor. We do not know who committed\nthe crime; we do not know of what wretch Monsieur and Mademoiselle\nStangerson are the victims, but there is no doubt that they both know!\nThe secret must be a terrible one, for the father had not hesitated\nto leave his daughter to die behind a door which she had shut upon\nherself,--terrible for him to have allowed the assassin to escape. For\nthere is no other way in the world to explain the murderer's flight from\nThe Yellow Room!\"\n\nThe silence which followed this dramatic and lucid explanation was\nappalling. We all of us felt grieved for the illustrious professor,\ndriven into a corner by the pitiless logic of Frederic Larsan, forced\nto confess the whole truth of his martyrdom or to keep silent, and thus\nmake a yet more terrible admission. The man himself, a veritable statue\nof sorrow, raised his hand with a gesture so solemn that we bowed our\nheads to it as before something sacred. He then pronounced these words,\nin a voice so loud that it seemed to exhaust him:\n\n\"I swear by the head of my suffering child that I never for an instant\nleft the door of her chamber after hearing her cries for help; that\nthat door was not opened while I was alone in the laboratory; and that,\nfinally, when we entered The Yellow Room, my three domestics and I, the\nmurderer was no longer there! I swear I do not know the murderer!\"\n\nMust I say it,--in spite of the solemnity of Monsieur Stangerson's\nwords, we did not believe in his denial. Frederic Larsan had shown us\nthe truth and it was not so easily given up.\n\nMonsieur de Marquet announced that the conversation was at an end, and\nas we were about to leave the laboratory, Joseph Rouletabille approached\nMonsieur Stangerson, took him by the hand with the greatest respect, and\nI heard him say:\n\n\"I believe you, Monsieur.\"\n\nI here close the citation which I have thought it my duty to make from\nMonsieur Maleine's narrative. I need not tell the reader that all that\npassed in the laboratory was immediately and faithfully reported to me\nby Rouletabille.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. Frederic Larsan's Cane\n\n\nIt was not till six o'clock that I left the chateau, taking with me the\narticle hastily written by my friend in the little sitting-room which\nMonsieur Robert Darzac had placed at our disposal. The reporter was\nto sleep at the chateau, taking advantage of the to me inexplicable\nhospitality offered him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, to whom Monsieur\nStangerson, in that sad time, left the care of all his domestic affairs.\nNevertheless he insisted on accompanying me to the station at Epinay. In\ncrossing the park, he said to me:\n\n\"Frederic is really very clever and has not belied his reputation. Do\nyou know how he came to find Daddy Jacques's boots?--Near the spot where\nwe noticed the traces of the neat boots and the disappearance of the\nrough ones, there was a square hole, freshly made in the moist ground,\nwhere a stone had evidently been removed. Larsan searched for that stone\nwithout finding it, and at once imagined that it had been used by the\nmurderer with which to sink the boots in the lake. Fred's calculation\nwas an excellent one, as the success of his search proves. That escaped\nme; but my mind was turned in another direction by the large number\nof false indications of his track which the murderer left, and by\nthe measure of the black foot-marks corresponding with that of Daddy\nJacques's boots, which I had established without his suspecting it, on\nthe floor of The Yellow Room. All which was a proof, in my eyes, that\nthe murderer had sought to turn suspicion on to the old servant. Up to\nthat point, Larsan and I are in accord; but no further. It is going to\nbe a terrible matter; for I tell you he is working on wrong lines, and\nI--I, must fight him with nothing!\"\n\nI was surprised at the profoundly grave accent with which my young\nfriend pronounced the last words.\n\nHe repeated:\n\n\"Yes terrible!--terrible! For it is fighting with nothing, when you have\nonly an idea to fight with.\"\n\nAt that moment we passed by the back of the chateau. Night had come. A\nwindow on the first floor was partly open. A feeble light came from it\nas well as some sounds which drew our attention. We approached until we\nhad reached the side of a door that was situated just under the window.\nRouletabille, in a low tone, made me understand, that this was the\nwindow of Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber. The sounds which had\nattracted our attention ceased, then were renewed for a moment, and then\nwe heard stifled sobs. We were only able to catch these words, which\nreached us distinctly: \"My poor Robert!\"--Rouletabille whispered in my\near:\n\n\"If we only knew what was being said in that chamber, my inquiry would\nsoon be finished.\"\n\nHe looked about him. The darkness of the evening enveloped us; we could\nnot see much beyond the narrow path bordered by trees, which ran behind\nthe chateau. The sobs had ceased.\n\n\"If we can't hear we may at least try to see,\" said Rouletabille.\n\nAnd, making a sign to me to deaden the sound of my steps, he led me\nacross the path to the trunk of a tall beech tree, the white bole of\nwhich was visible in the darkness. This tree grew exactly in front of\nthe window in which we were so much interested, its lower branches being\non a level with the first floor of the chateau. From the height of\nthose branches one might certainly see what was passing in Mademoiselle\nStangerson's chamber. Evidently that was what Rouletabille thought, for,\nenjoining me to remain hidden, he clasped the trunk with his vigorous\narms and climbed up. I soon lost sight of him amid the branches, and\nthen followed a deep silence. In front of me, the open window remained\nlighted, and I saw no shadow move across it. I listened, and presently\nfrom above me these words reached my ears:\n\n\"After you!\"\n\n\"After you, pray!\"\n\nSomebody was overhead, speaking,--exchanging courtesies. What was my\nastonishment to see on the slippery column of the tree two human forms\nappear and quietly slip down to the ground. Rouletabille had mounted\nalone, and had returned with another.\n\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Sainclair!\"\n\nIt was Frederic Larsan. The detective had already occupied the post of\nobservation when my young friend had thought to reach it alone. Neither\nnoticed my astonishment. I explained that to myself by the fact that\nthey must have been witnesses of some tender and despairing scene\nbetween Mademoiselle Stangerson, lying in her bed, and Monsieur Darzac\non his knees by her pillow. I guessed that each had drawn different\nconclusions from what they had seen. It was easy to see that the scene\nhad strongly impressed Rouletabille in favour of Monsieur Robert Darzac;\nwhile, to Larsan, it showed nothing but consummate hypocrisy, acted with\nfinished art by Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiance.\n\nAs we reached the park gate, Larsan stopped us.\n\n\"My cane!\" he cried. \"I left it near the tree.\"\n\nHe left us, saying he would rejoin us presently.\n\n\"Have you noticed Frederic Larsan's cane?\" asked the young reporter, as\nsoon as we were alone. \"It is quite a new one, which I have never seen\nhim use before. He seems to take great care of it--it never leaves him.\nOne would think he was afraid it might fall into the hands of strangers.\nI never saw it before to-day. Where did he find it? It isn't natural\nthat a man who had never before used a walking-stick should, the day\nafter the Glandier crime, never move a step without one. On the day of\nour arrival at the chateau, as soon as he saw us, he put his watch in\nhis pocket and picked up his cane from the ground--a proceeding to which\nI was perhaps wrong not to attach some importance.\"\n\nWe were now out of the park. Rouletabille had dropped into silence. His\nthoughts were certainly still occupied with Frederic Larsan's new cane.\nI had proof of that when, as we came near to Epinay, he said:\n\n\"Frederic Larsan arrived at the Glandier before me; he began his\ninquiry before me; he has had time to find out things about which I know\nnothing. Where did he find that cane?\" Then he added: \"It is probable\nthat his suspicion--more than that, his reasoning--has led him to lay\nhis hand on something tangible. Has this cane anything to do with it?\nWhere the deuce could he have found it?\"\n\nAs I had to wait twenty minutes for the train at Epinay, we entered a\nwine shop. Almost immediately the door opened and Frederic Larsan made\nhis appearance, brandishing his famous cane.\n\n\"I found it!\" he said laughingly.\n\nThe three of us seated ourselves at a table. Rouletabille never took\nhis eyes off the cane; he was so absorbed that he did not notice a sign\nLarsan made to a railway employeee, a young man with a chin decorated by a\ntiny blond and ill-kept beard. On the sign he rose, paid for his drink,\nbowed, and went out. I should not myself have attached any importance\nto the circumstance, if it had not been recalled to my mind, some months\nlater, by the reappearance of the man with the beard at one of the most\ntragic moments of this case. I then learned that the youth was one of\nLarsan's assistants and had been charged by him to watch the going and\ncoming of travellers at the station of Epinay-sur-Orge. Larsan neglected\nnothing in any case on which he was engaged.\n\nI turned my eyes again on Rouletabille.\n\n\"Ah,--Monsieur Fred!\" he said, \"when did you begin to use a\nwalking-stick? I have always seen you walking with your hands in your\npockets!\"\n\n\"It is a present,\" replied the detective.\n\n\"Recent?\" insisted Rouletabille.\n\n\"No, it was given to me in London.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I remember--you have just come from London. May I look at it?\"\n\n\"Oh!--certainly!\"\n\nFred passed the cane to Rouletabille. It was a large yellow bamboo with\na crutch handle and ornamented with a gold ring. Rouletabille,\nafter examining it minutely, returned it to Larsan, with a bantering\nexpression on his face, saying:\n\n\"You were given a French cane in London!\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Fred, imperturbably.\n\n\"Read the mark there, in tiny letters: Cassette, 6a, Opera.\"\n\n\"Cannot English people buy canes in Paris?\"\n\nWhen Rouletabille had seen me into the train, he said:\n\n\"You'll remember the address?\"\n\n\"Yes,--Cassette, 6a, Opera. Rely on me; you shall have word tomorrow\nmorning.\"\n\nThat evening, on reaching Paris, I saw Monsieur Cassette, dealer in\nwalking-sticks and umbrellas, and wrote to my friend:\n\n\"A man unmistakably answering to the description of Monsieur Robert\nDarzac--same height, slightly stooping, putty-coloured overcoat, bowler\nhat--purchased a cane similar to the one in which we are interested, on\nthe evening of the crime, about eight o'clock. Monsieur Cassette had not\nsold another such cane during the last two years. Fred's cane is new.\nIt is quite clear that it's the same cane. Fred did not buy it, since\nhe was in London. Like you, I think that he found it somewhere near\nMonsieur Robert Darzac. But if, as you suppose, the murderer was in The\nYellow Room for five, or even six hours, and the crime was not\ncommitted until towards midnight, the purchase of this cane proves an\nincontestable alibi for Darzac.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. \"The Presbytery Has Lost Nothing of Its Charm, Nor the\nGarden Its Brightness\"\n\n\nA week after the occurrence of the events I have just recounted--on\nthe 2nd of November, to be exact--I received at my home in Paris the\nfollowing telegraphic message: \"Come to the Glandier by the earliest\ntrain. Bring revolvers. Friendly greetings. Rouletabille.\"\n\nI have already said, I think, that at that period, being a young\nbarrister with but few briefs, I frequented the Palais de Justice rather\nfor the purpose of familiarising myself with my professional duties than\nfor the defence of the widow and orphan. I could, therefore, feel no\nsurprise at Rouletabille disposing of my time. Moreover, he knew how\nkeenly interested I was in his journalistic adventures in general and,\nabove all, in the murder at the Glandier. I had not heard from him for a\nweek, nor of the progress made with that mysterious case, except by the\ninnumerable paragraphs in the newspapers and by the very brief notes\nof Rouletabille in the \"Epoque.\" Those notes had divulged the fact that\ntraces of human blood had been found on the mutton-bone, as well as\nfresh traces of the blood of Mademoiselle Stangerson--the old stains\nbelonged to other crimes, probably dating years back.\n\nIt may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention of the\npress throughout the world. No crime known had more absorbed the minds\nof people. It appeared to me, however, that the judicial inquiry was\nmaking but very little progress; and I should have been very glad, if,\non the receipt of my friend's invitation to rejoin him at the Glandier,\nthe despatch had not contained the words, \"Bring revolvers.\"\n\nThat puzzled me greatly. Rouletabille telegraphing for revolvers meant\nthat there might be occasion to use them. Now, I confess it without\nshame, I am not a hero. But here was a friend, evidently in danger,\ncalling on me to go to his aid. I did not hesitate long; and after\nassuring myself that the only revolver I possessed was properly loaded,\nI hurried towards the Orleans station. On the way I remembered that\nRouletabille had asked for two revolvers; I therefore entered a\ngunsmith's shop and bought an excellent weapon for my friend.\n\nI had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay; but he was not there.\nHowever, a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at the Glandier. Nobody\nwas at the gate, and it was only on the threshold of the chateau that I\nmet the young man. He saluted me with a friendly gesture and threw his\narms about me, inquiring warmly as to the state of my health.\n\nWhen we were in the little sitting-room of which I have spoken,\nRouletabille made me sit down.\n\n\"It's going badly,\" he said.\n\n\"What's going badly?\" I asked.\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\nHe came nearer to me and whispered:\n\n\"Frederic Larsan is working with might and main against Darzac.\"\n\nThis did not astonish me. I had seen the poor show Mademoiselle\nStangerson's fiance had made at the time of the examination of the\nfootprints. However, I immediately asked:\n\n\"What about that cane?\"\n\n\"It is still in the hands of Frederic Larsan. He never lets go of it.\"\n\n\"But doesn't it prove the alibi for Monsieur Darzac?\"\n\n\"Not at all. Gently questioned by me, Darzac denied having, on that\nevening, or on any other, purchased a cane at Cassette's. However,\"\nsaid Rouletabille, \"I'll not swear to anything; Monsieur Darzac has such\nstrange fits of silence that one does not know exactly what to think of\nwhat he says.\"\n\n\"To Frederic Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very damaging\nevidence. But in what way? The time when it was bought shows it could\nnot have been in the murderer's possession.\"\n\n\"The time doesn't worry Larsan. He is not obliged to adopt my theory\nwhich assumes that the murderer got into The Yellow Room between five\nand six o'clock. But there's nothing to prevent him assuming that the\nmurderer got in between ten and eleven o'clock at night. At that hour\nMonsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson, assisted by Daddy Jacques, were\nengaged in making an interesting chemical experiment in the part of the\nlaboratory taken up by the furnaces. Larsan says, unlikely as that may\nseem, that the murderer may have slipped behind them. He has already got\nthe examining magistrate to listen to him. When one looks closely into\nit, the reasoning is absurd, seeing that the 'intimate'--if there\nis one--must have known that the professor would shortly leave the\npavilion, and that the 'friend' had only to put off operating till\nafter the professor's departure. Why should he have risked crossing the\nlaboratory while the professor was in it? And then, when he had got into\nThe Yellow Room?\n\n\"There are many points to be cleared up before Larsan's theory can be\nadmitted. I sha'n't waste my time over it, for my theory won't allow me\nto occupy myself with mere imagination. Only, as I am obliged for the\nmoment to keep silent, and Larsan sometimes talks, he may finish by\ncoming out openly against Monsieur Darzac,--if I'm not there,\" added the\nyoung reporter proudly. \"For there are surface evidences against Darzac,\nmuch more convincing than that cane, which remains incomprehensible\nto me, all the more so as Larsan does not in the least hesitate to let\nDarzac see him with it!--I understand many things in Larsan's theory,\nbut I can't make anything of that cane.\n\n\"Is he still at the chateau?\"\n\n\"Yes; he hardly ever leaves it!--He sleeps there, as I do, at the\nrequest of Monsieur Stangerson, who has done for him what Monsieur\nRobert Darzac has done for me. In spite of the accusation made by Larsan\nthat Monsieur Stangerson knows who the murderer is he yet affords him\nevery facility for arriving at the truth,--just as Darzac is doing for\nme.\"\n\n\"But you are convinced of Darzac's innocence?\"\n\n\"At one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt. That was\nwhen we arrived here for the first time. The time has come for me to\ntell you what has passed between Monsieur Darzac and myself.\"\n\nHere Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had brought the\nrevolvers. I showed him them. Having examined both, he pronounced them\nexcellent, and handed them back to me.\n\n\"Shall we have any use for them?\" I asked.\n\n\"No doubt; this evening. We shall pass the night here--if that won't\ntire you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" I said with an expression that made Rouletabille\nlaugh.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"this is no time for laughing. You remember the\nphrase which was the 'open sesame' of this chateau full of mystery?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"perfectly,--'The presbytery has lost nothing of its\ncharm, nor the garden its brightness.' It was the phrase which you found\non the half-burned piece of paper amongst the ashes in the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Yes; at the bottom of the paper, where the flame had not reached, was\nthis date: 23rd of October. Remember this date, it is highly important.\nI am now going to tell you about that curious phrase. On the evening\nbefore the crime, that is to say, on the 23rd, Monsieur and Mademoiselle\nStangerson were at a reception at the Elysee. I know that, because I was\nthere on duty, having to interview one of the savants of the Academy of\nPhiladelphia, who was being feted there. I had never before seen either\nMonsieur or Mademoiselle Stangerson. I was seated in the room which\nprecedes the Salon des Ambassadeurs, and, tired of being jostled by so\nmany noble personages, I had fallen into a vague reverie, when I scented\nnear me the perfume of the lady in black.\n\n\"Do you ask me what is the 'perfume of the lady in black'? It must\nsuffice for you to know that it is a perfume of which I am very fond,\nbecause it was that of a lady who had been very kind to me in my\nchildhood,--a lady whom I had always seen dressed in black. The lady\nwho, that evening, was scented with the perfume of the lady in black,\nwas dressed in white. She was wonderfully beautiful. I could not help\nrising and following her. An old man gave her his arm and, as they\npassed, I heard voices say: 'Professor Stangerson and his daughter.' It\nwas in that way I learned who it was I was following.\n\n\"They met Monsieur Robert Darzac, whom I knew by sight. Professor\nStangerson, accosted by Mr. Arthur William Rance, one of the American\nsavants, seated himself in the great gallery, and Monsieur Robert Darzac\nled Mademoiselle Stangerson into the conservatory. I followed. The\nweather was very mild that evening; the garden doors were open.\nMademoiselle Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her shoulders and I\nplainly saw that it was she who was begging Monsieur Darzac to go with\nher into the garden. I continued to follow, interested by the agitation\nplainly exhibited by the bearing of Monsieur Darzac. They slowly passed\nalong the wall abutting on the Avenue Marigny. I took the central alley,\nwalking parallel with them, and then crossed over for the purpose of\ngetting nearer to them. The night was dark, and the grass deadened the\nsound of my steps. They had stopped under the vacillating light of a gas\njet and appeared to be both bending over a paper held by Mademoiselle\nStangerson, reading something which deeply interested them. I stopped in\nthe darkness and silence.\n\n\"Neither of them saw me, and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle Stangerson\nrepeat, as she was refolding the paper: 'The presbytery has lost nothing\nof its charm, nor the garden its brightness!'--It was said in a tone at\nonce mocking and despairing, and was followed by a burst of such nervous\nlaughter that I think her words will never cease to sound in my ears.\nBut another phrase was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: 'Must I commit\na crime, then, to win you?' He was in an extraordinarily agitated state.\nHe took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and held it for a long time\nto his lips, and I thought, from the movement of his shoulders, that he\nwas crying. Then they went away.\n\n\"When I returned to the great gallery,\" continued Rouletabille, \"I saw\nno more of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and I was not to see him again until\nafter the tragedy at the Glandier. Mademoiselle was near Mr. Rance,\nwho was talking with much animation, his eyes, during the conversation,\nglowing with a singular brightness. Mademoiselle Stangerson, I thought,\nwas not even listening to what he was saying, her face expressing\nperfect indifference. His face was the red face of a drunkard. When\nMonsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson left, he went to the bar and\nremained there. I joined him, and rendered him some little service\nin the midst of the pressing crowd. He thanked me and told me he was\nreturning to America three days later, that is to say, on the 26th (the\nday after the crime). I talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me\nhe had lived there for five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he\nhad met the illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter. He drank\na great deal of champagne, and when I left him he was very nearly drunk.\n\n\"Such were my experiences on that evening, and I leave you to imagine\nwhat effect the news of the attempted murder of Mademoiselle Stangerson\nproduced on me,--with what force those words pronounced by Monsieur\nRobert Darzac, 'Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?' recurred to\nme. It was not this phrase, however, that I repeated to him, when we met\nhere at Glandier. The sentence of the presbytery and the bright garden\nsufficed to open the gate of the chateau. If you ask me if I believe\nnow that Monsieur Darzac is the murderer, I must say I do not. I do not\nthink I ever quite thought that. At the time I could not really think\nseriously of anything. I had so little evidence to go on. But I needed\nto have at once the proof that he had not been wounded in the hand.\n\n\"When we were alone together, I told him how I had chanced to overhear\na part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the garden\nof the Elysee; and when I repeated to him the words, 'Must I commit a\ncrime, then, to win you?' he was greatly troubled, though much less so\nthan he had been by hearing me repeat the phrase about the presbytery.\nWhat threw him into a state of real consternation was to learn from me\nthat the day on which he had gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the\nElysee, was the very day on which she had gone to the Post Office for\nthe letter. It was that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words:\n'The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its\nbrightness.' My surmise was confirmed by my finding, if you remember,\nin the ashes of the laboratory, the fragment of paper dated October the\n23rd. The letter had been written and withdrawn from the Post Office on\nthe same day.\n\n\"There can be no doubt that, on returning from the Elysee that night,\nMademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that compromising paper.\nIt was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied that that letter had anything\nwhatever to do with the crime. I told him that in an affair so filled\nwith mystery as this, he had no right to hide this letter; that I was\npersuaded it was of considerable importance; that the desperate tone in\nwhich Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced the prophetic phrase,--that\nhis own tears, and the threat of a crime which he had professed after\nthe letter was read--all these facts tended to leave no room for me to\ndoubt. Monsieur Darzac became more and more agitated, and I determined\nto take advantage of the effect I had produced on him. 'You were on\nthe point of being married, Monsieur,' I said negligently and without\nlooking at him, 'and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because\nof the writer of that letter; because as soon as his letter was read,\nyou spoke of the necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle Stangerson.\nTherefore there is someone between you and her someone who has attempted\nto kill her, so that she should not be able to marry!' And I concluded\nwith these words: 'Now, monsieur, you have only to tell me in confidence\nthe name of the murderer!'--The words I had uttered must have struck\nhim ominously, for when I turned my eyes on him, I saw that his face was\nhaggard, the perspiration standing on his forehead, and terror showing\nin his eyes.\n\n\"'Monsieur,' he said to me, 'I am going to ask of you something which\nmay appear insane, but in exchange for which I place my life in your\nhands. You must not tell the magistrates of what you saw and heard in\nthe garden of the Elysee,--neither to them nor to anybody. I swear to\nyou, that I am innocent, and I know, I feel, that you believe me; but I\nwould rather be taken for the guilty man than see justice go astray\non that phrase, \"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm, nor the\ngarden its brightness.\" The judges must know nothing about that phrase.\nAll this matter is in your hands. Monsieur, I leave it there; but forget\nthe evening at the Elysee. A hundred other roads are open to you in your\nsearch for the criminal. I will open them for you myself. I will help\nyou. Will you take up your quarters here?--You may remain here to do as\nyou please.--Eat--sleep here--watch my actions--the actions of all here.\nYou shall be master of the Glandier, Monsieur; but forget the evening at\nthe Elysee.'\"\n\nRouletabille here paused to take breath. I now understood what had\nappeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert Darzac\ntowards my friend, and the facility with which the young reporter had\nbeen able to install himself on the scene of the crime. My curiosity\ncould not fail to be excited by all I had heard. I asked Rouletabille to\nsatisfy it still further. What had happened at the Glandier during\nthe past week?--Had he not told me that there were surface indications\nagainst Monsieur Darzac much more terrible than that of the cane found\nby Larsan?\n\n\"Everything seems to be pointing against him,\" replied my friend, \"and\nthe situation is becoming exceedingly grave. Monsieur Darzac appears not\nto mind it much; but in that he is wrong. I was interested only in\nthe health of Mademoiselle Stangerson, which was daily improving, when\nsomething occurred that is even more mysterious than--than the mystery\nof The Yellow Room!\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" I cried, \"What could be more mysterious than that?\"\n\n\"Let us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac,\" said Rouletabille,\ncalming me. \"I have said that everything seems to be pointing against\nhim. The marks of the neat boots found by Frederic Larsan appear to be\nreally the footprints of Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiance. The marks\nmade by the bicycle may have been made by his bicycle. He had usually\nleft it at the chateau; why did he take it to Paris on that particular\noccasion? Was it because he was not going to return again to the\nchateau? Was it because, owing to the breaking off of his marriage, his\nrelations with the Stangersons were to cease? All who are interested in\nthe matter affirm that those relations were to continue unchanged.\n\n\"Frederic Larsan, however, believes that all relations were at an end.\nFrom the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied Mademoiselle Stangerson to\nthe Grands Magasins de la Louvre until the day after the crime, he had\nnot been at the Glandier. Remember that Mademoiselle Stangerson lost\nher reticule containing the key with the brass head while she was in\nhis company. From that day to the evening at the Elysee, the Sorbonne\nprofessor and Mademoiselle Stangerson did not see one another; but they\nmay have written to each other. Mademoiselle Stangerson went to the Post\nOffice to get a letter, which Larsan says was written by Robert Darzac;\nfor knowing nothing of what had passed at the Elysee, Larsan believes\nthat it was Monsieur Darzac himself who stole the reticule with the key,\nwith the design of forcing her consent, by getting possession of the\nprecious papers of her father--papers which he would have restored to\nhim on condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled.\n\n\"All that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd hypothesis,\nas Larsan admitted to me, but for another and much graver circumstance.\nIn the first place here is something which I have not been able to\nexplain--Monsieur Darzac had himself, on the 24th, gone to the Post\nOffice to ask for the letter which Mademoiselle had called for and\nreceived on the previous evening. The description of the man who made\napplication tallies in every respect with the appearance of Monsieur\nDarzac, who, in answer to the questions put to him by the examining\nmagistrate, denies that he went to the Post Office. Now even admitting\nthat the letter was written by him--which I do not believe--he knew that\nMademoiselle Stangerson had received it, since he had seen it in her\nhands in the garden at the Elysee. It could not have been he, then, who\nhad gone to the Post Office, the day after the 24th, to ask for a letter\nwhich he knew was no longer there.\n\n\"To me it appears clear that somebody, strongly resembling him, stole\nMademoiselle Stangerson's reticule and in that letter, had demanded of\nher something which she had not sent him. He must have been surprised at\nthe failure of his demand, hence his application at the Post Office, to\nlearn whether his letter had been delivered to the person to whom it had\nbeen addressed. Finding that it had been claimed, he had become furious.\nWhat had he demanded? Nobody but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows. Then, on\nthe day following, it is reported that she had been attacked during the\nnight, and, the next day, I discovered that the Professor had, at the\nsame time, been robbed by means of the key referred to in the poste\nrestante letter. It would seem, then, that the man who went to the Post\nOffice to inquire for the letter must have been the murderer. All these\narguments Larsan applies as against Monsieur Darzac. You may be sure\nthat the examining magistrate, Larsan, and myself, have done our best\nto get from the Post Office precise details relative to the singular\npersonage who applied there on the 24th of October. But nothing has been\nlearned. We don't know where he came from--or where he went. Beyond the\ndescription which makes him resemble Monsieur Darzac, we know nothing.\n\n\"I have announced in the leading journals that a handsome reward will be\ngiven to a driver of any public conveyance who drove a fare to No. 40,\nPost Office, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 24th of October.\nInformation to be addressed to 'M. R.,' at the office of the 'Epoque';\nbut no answer has resulted. The man may have walked; but, as he was most\nlikely in a hurry, there was a chance that he might have gone in a cab.\nWho, I keep asking myself night and day, is the man who so strongly\nresembles Monsieur Robert Darzac, and who is also known to have bought\nthe cane which has fallen into Larsan's hands?\n\n\"The most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the very same\ntime that his double presented himself at the Post Office, scheduled for\na lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered that lecture, and one\nof his friends took his place. When I questioned him as to how he had\nemployeeed the time, he told me that he had gone for a stroll in the Bois\nde Boulogne. What do you think of a professor who, instead of giving\nhis lecture, obtains a substitute to go for a stroll in the Bois de\nBoulogne? When Frederic Larsan asked him for information on this point,\nhe quietly replied that it was no business of his how he spent his time\nin Paris. On which Fred swore aloud that he would find out, without\nanybody's help.\n\n\"All this seems to fit in with Fred's hypothesis, namely, that Monsieur\nStangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to avoid a scandal.\nThe hypothesis is further substantiated by the fact that Darzac was in\nThe Yellow Room and was permitted to get away. That hypothesis I believe\nto be a false one.--Larsan is being misled by it, though that would\nnot displease me, did it not affect an innocent person. Now does that\nhypothesis really mislead Frederic Larsan? That is the question--that is\nthe question.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is right,\" I cried, interrupting Rouletabille. \"Are you\nsure that Monsieur Darzac is innocent?--It seems to me that these are\nextraordinary coincidences--\"\n\n\"Coincidences,\" replied my friend, \"are the worst enemies to truth.\"\n\n\"What does the examining magistrate think now of the matter?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac, in the absence\nof absolute proofs. Not only would he have public opinion wholly against\nhim, to say nothing of the Sorbonne, but Monsieur and Mademoiselle\nStangerson. She adores Monsieur Robert Darzac. Indistinctly as she saw\nthe murderer, it would be hard to make the public believe that she could\nnot have recognised him, if Darzac had been the criminal. No doubt The\nYellow Room was very dimly lit; but a night-light, however small, gives\nsome light. Here, my boy, is how things stood when, three days, or\nrather three nights ago, an extraordinarily strange incident occurred.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. \"I Expect the Assassin This Evening\"\n\n\n\"I must take you,\" said Rouletabille, \"so as to enable you to\nunderstand, to the various scenes. I myself believe that I have\ndiscovered what everybody else is searching for, namely, how the\nmurderer escaped from The Yellow Room, without any accomplice, and\nwithout Mademoiselle Stangerson having had anything to do with it. But\nso long as I am not sure of the real murderer, I cannot state the theory\non which I am working. I can only say that I believe it to be correct\nand, in any case, a quite natural and simple one. As to what happened in\nthis place three nights ago, I must say it kept me wondering for a whole\nday and a night. It passes all belief. The theory I have formed from\nthe incident is so absurd that I would rather matters remained as yet\nunexplained.\"\n\nSaying which the young reporter invited me to go and make the tour of\nthe chateau with him. The only sound to be heard was the crunching of\nthe dead leaves beneath our feet. The silence was so intense that one\nmight have thought the chateau had been abandoned. The old stones, the\nstagnant water of the ditch surrounding the donjon, the bleak ground\nstrewn with the dead leaves, the dark, skeleton-like outlines of the\ntrees, all contributed to give to the desolate place, now filled with\nits awful mystery, a most funereal aspect. As we passed round the\ndonjon, we met the Green Man, the forest-keeper, who did not greet us,\nbut walked by as if we had not existed. He was looking just as I had\nformerly seen him through the window of the Donjon Inn. He had still\nhis fowling-piece slung at his back, his pipe was in his mouth, and his\neye-glasses on his nose.\n\n\"An odd kind of fish!\" Rouletabille said to me, in a low tone.\n\n\"Have you spoken to him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, but I could get nothing out of him. His only answers are grunts\nand shrugs of the shoulders. He generally lives on the first floor of\nthe donjon, a big room that once served for an oratory. He lives like\na bear, never goes out without his gun, and is only pleasant with the\ngirls. The women, for twelve miles round, are all setting their caps for\nhim. For the present, he is paying attention to Madame Mathieu, whose\nhusband is keeping a lynx eye upon her in consequence.\"\n\nAfter passing the donjon, which is situated at the extreme end of the\nleft wing, we went to the back of the chateau. Rouletabille, pointing\nto a window which I recognised as the only one belonging to Mademoiselle\nStangerson's apartment, said to me:\n\n\"If you had been here, two nights ago, you would have seen your humble\nservant at the top of a ladder, about to enter the chateau by that\nwindow.\"\n\nAs I expressed some surprise at this piece of nocturnal gymnastics, he\nbegged me to notice carefully the exterior disposition of the chateau.\nWe then went back into the building.\n\n\"I must now show you the first floor of the chateau, where I am living,\"\nsaid my friend.\n\nTo enable the reader the better to understand the disposition of these\nparts of the dwelling, I annex a plan of the first floor of the right\nwing, drawn by Rouletabille the day after the extraordinary phenomenon\noccurred, the details of which I am about to relate.\n\n\n                         boudoir\n  ___ ____ ___________ _______\\___ ________4________ _______ _________ __\n  |             |            |   |             |           |\n  |             |  Mlle.     |   |    Mlle.    |___ ___ ___|    Mr.\n     Lumber     |Strangerson's    Strangerson's|___ ___ ___|Strangerson's\n  |   Room      | Sitting    |   |   Bed Room  |___ ___ ___|   Room\n  |             |  Room      |   |__  __  _____|stair-case |\n                |            |   |bath|anteroom|           |\n  |_____  ______|____  ______|___|____|___  ___|           |______  _____\n  |\n   2 ------ Right Gallery  Right Wing--------- 3            Right Gallery\n                                                             Left Wing\n  |_________    _____ _________ ______ _______ __ __   __ _________ _____\n\n  |Roulet-   | W G |\n  |tabille's | I A |        Right Wing                         Left Wing\n  | Room       N L           of the\n  |_________ | D L |         Chateau\n   Frederic  | I E |\n  |Larsan's    N R\n  |  Room    | G Y |\n             |     |\n  |____ ____ | _1_ |\n  .           5 .\n   .     6     .\n    .        .\n      . . .\n\n\nRouletabille motioned me to follow him up a magnificent flight of stairs\nending in a landing on the first floor. From this landing one could pass\nto the right or left wing of the chateau by a gallery opening from it.\nThis gallery, high and wide, extended along the whole length of the\nbuilding and was lit from the front of the chateau facing the north.\nThe rooms, the windows of which looked to the south, opened out of the\ngallery. Professor Stangerson inhabited the left wing of the building.\nMademoiselle Stangerson had her apartment in the right wing.\n\nWe entered the gallery to the right. A narrow carpet, laid on the\nwaxed oaken floor, which shone like glass, deadened the sound of our\nfootsteps. Rouletabille asked me, in a low tone, to walk carefully, as\nwe were passing the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson's apartment. This\nconsisted of a bed-room, an ante-room, a small bath-room, a boudoir,\nand a drawing-room. One could pass from one to another of these rooms\nwithout having to go by way of the gallery. The gallery continued\nstraight to the western end of the building, where it was lit by a high\nwindow (window 2 on the plan). At about two-thirds of its length this\ngallery, at a right angle, joined another gallery following the course\nof the right wing.\n\nThe better to follow this narrative, we shall call the gallery leading\nfrom the stairs to the eastern window, the \"right\" gallery and the\ngallery quitting it at a right angle, the \"off-turning\" gallery (winding\ngallery in the plan). It was at the meeting point of the two galleries\nthat Rouletabille had his chamber, adjoining that of Frederic Larsan,\nthe door of each opening on to the \"off-turning\" gallery, while the\ndoors of Mademoiselle Stangerson's apartment opened into the \"right\"\ngallery. (See the plan.)\n\nRouletabille opened the door of his room and after we had passed in,\ncarefully drew the bolt. I had not had time to glance round the place\nin which he had been installed, when he uttered a cry of surprise and\npointed to a pair of eye-glasses on a side-table.\n\n\"What are these doing here?\" he asked.\n\nI should have been puzzled to answer him.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"I wonder if this is what I have been searching\nfor. I wonder if these are the eye-glasses from the presbytery!\"\n\nHe seized them eagerly, his fingers caressing the glass. Then looking at\nme, with an expression of terror on his face, he murmured, \"Oh!--Oh!\"\n\nHe repeated the exclamation again and again, as if his thoughts had\nsuddenly turned his brain.\n\nHe rose and, putting his hand on my shoulder, laughed like one demented\nas he said:\n\n\"Those glasses will drive me silly! Mathematically speaking the thing\nis possible; but humanly speaking it is impossible--or afterwards--or\nafterwards--\"\n\nTwo light knocks struck the door. Rouletabille opened it. A figure\nentered. I recognised the concierge, whom I had seen when she was being\ntaken to the pavilion for examination. I was surprised, thinking she was\nstill under lock and key. This woman said in a very low tone:\n\n\"In the grove of the parquet.\"\n\nRouletabille replied: \"Thanks.\"--The woman then left. He again turned\nto me, his look haggard, after having carefully refastened the door,\nmuttering some incomprehensible phrases.\n\n\"If the thing is mathematically possible, why should it not be\nhumanly!--And if it is humanly possible, the matter is simply awful.\" I\ninterrupted him in his soliloquy:\n\n\"Have they set the concierges at liberty, then?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"I had them liberated, I needed people I could trust.\nThe woman is thoroughly devoted to me, and her husband would lay down\nhis life for me.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" I said, \"when will he have occasion to do it?\"\n\n\"This evening,--for this evening I expect the murderer.\"\n\n\"You expect the murderer this evening? Then you know him?\"\n\n\"I shall know him; but I should be mad to affirm, categorically, at this\nmoment that I do know him. The mathematical idea I have of the murderer\ngives results so frightful, so monstrous, that I hope it is still\npossible that I am mistaken. I hope so, with all my heart!\"\n\n\"Five minutes ago, you did not know the murderer; how can you say that\nyou expect him this evening?\"\n\n\"Because I know that he must come.\"\n\nRouletabille very slowly filled his pipe and lit it. That meant an\ninteresting story. At that moment we heard some one walking in the\ngallery and passing before our door. Rouletabille listened. The sound of\nthe footstep died away in the distance.\n\n\"Is Frederic Larsan in his room?\" I asked, pointing to the partition.\n\n\"No,\" my friend answered. \"He went to Paris this morning,--still on\nthe scent of Darzac, who also left for Paris. That matter will turn out\nbadly. I expect that Monsieur Darzac will be arrested in the course of\nthe next week. The worst of it is that everything seems to be in league\nagainst him,--circumstances, things, people. Not an hour passes without\nbringing some new evidence against him. The examining magistrate is\noverwhelmed by it--and blind.\"\n\n\"Frederic Larsan, however, is not a novice,\" I said.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Rouletabille, with a slightly contemptuous turn\nof his lips, \"I fancied he was a much abler man. I had, indeed, a great\nadmiration for him, before I got to know his method of working. It's\ndeplorable. He owes his reputation solely to his ability; but he lacks\nreasoning power,--the mathematics of his ideas are very poor.\"\n\nI looked closely at Rouletabille and could not help smiling, on hearing\nthis boy of eighteen talking of a man who had proved to the world that\nhe was the finest police sleuth in Europe.\n\n\"You smile,\" he said? \"you are wrong! I swear I will outwit him--and in\na striking way! But I must make haste about it, for he has an enormous\nstart on me--given him by Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is this evening\ngoing to increase it still more. Think of it!--every time the murderer\ncomes to the chateau, Monsieur Darzac, by a strange fatality, absents\nhimself and refuses to give any account of how he employs his time.\"\n\n\"Every time the assassin comes to the chateau!\" I cried. \"Has he\nreturned then--?\"\n\n\"Yes, during that famous night when the strange phenomenon occurred.\"\n\nI was now going to learn about the astonishing phenomenon to which\nRouletabille had made allusion half an hour earlier without giving me\nany explanation of it. But I had learned never to press Rouletabille in\nhis narratives. He spoke when the fancy took him and when he judged it\nto be right. He was less concerned about my curiosity than he was for\nmaking a complete summing up for himself of any important matter in\nwhich he was interested.\n\nAt last, in short rapid phrases, he acquainted me with things which\nplunged me into a state bordering on complete bewilderment. Indeed, the\nresults of that still unknown science known as hypnotism, for example,\nwere not more inexplicable than the disappearance of the \"matter\" of\nthe murderer at the moment when four persons were within touch of him. I\nspeak of hypnotism as I would of electricity, for of the nature of both\nwe are ignorant and we know little of their laws. I cite these examples\nbecause, at the time, the case appeared to me to be only explicable by\nthe inexplicable,--that is to say, by an event outside of known natural\nlaws. And yet, if I had had Rouletabille's brain, I should, like him,\nhave had a presentiment of the natural explanation; for the most curious\nthing about all the mysteries of the Glandier case was the natural\nmanner in which he explained them.\n\nI have among the papers that were sent me by the young man, after the\naffair was over, a note-book of his, in which a complete account is\ngiven of the phenomenon of the disappearance of the \"matter\" of the\nassassin, and the thoughts to which it gave rise in the mind of my young\nfriend. It is preferable, I think, to give the reader this account,\nrather than continue to reproduce my conversation with Rouletabille; for\nI should be afraid, in a history of this nature, to add a word that was\nnot in accordance with the strictest truth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. The Trap\n\n\n(EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE)\n\n\"Last night--the night between the 29th and 30th of October--\" wrote\nJoseph Rouletabille, \"I woke up towards one o'clock in the morning. Was\nit sleeplessness, or noise without?--The cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu\nrang out with sinister loudness from the end of the park. I rose and\nopened the window. Cold wind and rain; opaque darkness; silence. I\nreclosed my window. Again the sound of the cat's weird cry in the\ndistance. I partly dressed in haste. The weather was too bad for even\na cat to be turned out in it. What did it mean, then--that imitating\nof the mewing of Mother Angenoux' cat so near the chateau? I seized a\ngood-sized stick, the only weapon I had, and, without making any noise,\nopened the door.\n\n\"The gallery into which I went was well lit by a lamp with a reflector.\nI felt a keen current of air and, on turning, found the window open, at\nthe extreme end of the gallery, which I call the 'off-turning' gallery,\nto distinguish it from the 'right' gallery, on to which the apartment of\nMademoiselle Stangerson opened. These two galleries cross each other at\nright angles. Who had left that window open? Or, who had come to open\nit? I went to the window and leaned out. Five feet below me there was\na sort of terrace over the semi-circular projection of a room on the\nground-floor. One could, if one wanted, jump from the window on to\nthe terrace, and allow oneself to drop from it into the court of the\nchateau. Whoever had entered by this road had, evidently, not had a\nkey to the vestibule door. But why should I be thinking of my previous\nnight's attempt with the ladder?--Because of the open window--left open,\nperhaps, by the negligence of a servant? I reclosed it, smiling at\nthe ease with which I built a drama on the mere suggestion of an open\nwindow.\n\n\"Again the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu!--and then silence. The rain\nceased to beat on the window. All in the chateau slept. I walked with\ninfinite precaution on the carpet of the gallery. On reaching the corner\nof the 'right' gallery, I peered round it cautiously. There was another\nlamp there with a reflector which quite lit up the several objects in\nit,--three chairs and some pictures hanging on the wall. What was I\ndoing there? Perfect silence reigned throughout. Everything was sunk\nin repose. What was the instinct that urged me towards Mademoiselle\nStangerson's chamber? Why did a voice within me cry: 'Go on, to the\nchamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson!' I cast my eyes down upon the\ncarpet on which I was treading and saw that my steps were being directed\ntowards Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber by the marks of steps that\nhad already been made there. Yes, on the carpet were traces of footsteps\nstained with mud leading to the chamber of Mademoiselle Stangerson.\nHorror! Horror!--I recognised in those footprints the impression of\nthe neat boots of the murderer! He had come, then, from without in this\nwretched night. If you could descend from the gallery by way of the\nwindow, by means of the terrace, then you could get into the chateau by\nthe same means.\n\n\"The murderer was still in the chateau, for here were marks as of\nreturning footsteps. He had entered by the open window at the extremity\nof the 'off-turning' gallery; he had passed Frederic Larsan's door and\nmine, had turned to the right, and had entered Mademoiselle Stangerson's\nroom. I am before the door of her ante-room--it is open. I push it,\nwithout making the least noise. Under the door of the room itself I see\na streak of light. I listen--no sound--not even of breathing! Ah!--if\nI only knew what was passing in the silence that is behind that door!\nI find the door locked and the key turned on the inner side. And the\nmurderer is there, perhaps. He must be there! Will he escape this\ntime?--All depends on me!--I must be calm, and above all, I must make no\nfalse steps. I must see into that room. I can enter it by Mademoiselle\nStangerson's drawing-room; but, to do that I should have to cross her\nboudoir; and while I am there, the murderer may escape by the gallery\ndoor--the door in front of which I am now standing.\n\n\"I am sure that no other crime is being committed, on this night; for\nthere is complete silence in the boudoir, where two nurses are taking\ncare of Mademoiselle Stangerson until she is restored to health.\n\n\"As I am almost sure that the murderer is there, why do I not at once\ngive the alarm? The murderer may, perhaps, escape; but, perhaps, I may\nbe able to save Mademoiselle Stangerson's life. Suppose the murderer on\nthis occasion is not here to murder? The door has been opened to\nallow him to enter; by whom?--And it has been refastened--by\nwhom?--Mademoiselle Stangerson shuts herself up in her apartment with\nher nurses every night. Who turned the key of that chamber to allow\nthe murderer to enter?--The nurses,--two faithful domestics? The old\nchambermaid, Sylvia? It is very improbable. Besides, they slept in the\nboudoir, and Mademoiselle Stangerson, very nervous and careful, Monsieur\nRobert Darzac told me, sees to her own safety since she has been well\nenough to move about in her room, which I have not yet seen her leave.\nThis nervousness and sudden care on her part, which had struck Monsieur\nDarzac, had given me, also, food for thought. At the time of the\ncrime in The Yellow Room, there can be no doubt that she expected the\nmurderer. Was he expected this night?--Was it she herself who had opened\nher door to him? Had she some reason for doing so? Was she obliged to\ndo it?--Was it a meeting for purposes of crime?--Certainly it was not a\nlover's meeting, for I believe Mademoiselle Stangerson adores Monsieur\nDarzac.\n\n\"All these reflections ran through my brain like a flash of lightning.\nWhat would I not give to know!\n\n\"It is possible that there was some reason for the awful silence. My\nintervention might do more harm than good. How could I tell? How could I\nknow I might not any moment cause another crime? If I could only see and\nknow, without breaking that silence!\n\n\"I left the ante-room and descended the central stairs to the vestibule\nand, as silently as possible, made my way to the little room on the\nground-floor where Daddy Jacques had been sleeping since the attack made\nat the pavilion.\n\n\"I found him dressed, his eyes wide open, almost haggard. He did not\nseem surprised to see me. He told me that he had got up because he\nhad heard the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu, and because he had heard\nfootsteps in the park, close to his window, out of which he had looked\nand, just then, had seen a black shadow pass by. I asked him whether\nhe had a firearm of any kind. No, he no longer kept one, since the\nexamining magistrate had taken his revolver from him. We went out\ntogether, by a little back door, into the park, and stole along the\nchateau to the point which is just below Mademoiselle Stangerson's\nwindow.\n\n\"I placed Daddy Jacques against the wall, ordering him not to stir from\nthe spot, while I, taking advantage of a moment when the moon was hidden\nby a cloud, moved to the front of the window, out of the patch of light\nwhich came from it,--for the window was half-open! If I could only know\nwhat was passing in that silent chamber! I returned to Daddy Jacques and\nwhispered the word 'ladder' in his ear. At first I had thought of the\ntree which, a week ago, served me for an observatory; but I immediately\nsaw that, from the way the window was half-opened, I should not be able\nto see from that point of view anything that was passing in the room;\nand I wanted, not only to see, but to hear, and--to act.\n\n\"Greatly agitated, almost trembling, Daddy Jacques disappeared for a\nmoment and returned without the ladder, but making signs to me with his\narms, as signals to me to come quickly to him. When I got near him he\ngasped: 'Come!'\n\n\"'I went to the donjon in search of my ladder, and in the lower part of\nthe donjon which serves me and the gardener for a lumber room, I found\nthe door open and the ladder gone. On coming out, that's what I caught\nsight of by the light of the moon.\n\n\"And he pointed to the further end of the chateau, where a ladder stood\nresting against the stone brackets supporting the terrace, under\nthe window which I had found open. The projection of the terrace had\nprevented my seeing it. Thanks to that ladder, it was quite easy to get\ninto the 'off-turning' gallery of the first floor, and I had no doubt of\nit having been the road taken by the unknown.\n\n\"We ran to the ladder, but at the moment of reaching it, Daddy Jacques\ndrew my attention to the half-open door of the little semi-circular\nroom, situated under the terrace, at the extremity of the right wing of\nthe chateau, having the terrace for its roof. Daddy Jacques pushed the\ndoor open a little further and looked in.\n\n\"'He's not there!\" he whispered.\n\n\"Who is not there?\"\n\n\"The forest--keeper.\"\n\nWith his lips once more to my ear, he added:\n\n\"'Do you know that he has slept in the upper room of the donjon ever\nsince it was restored?' And with the same gesture he pointed to\nthe half-open door, the ladder, the terrace, and the windows in the\n'off-turning' gallery which, a little while before, I had re-closed.\n\n\"What were my thoughts then? I had no time to think. I felt more than I\nthought.\n\n\"Evidently, I felt, if the forest-keeper is up there in the chamber (I\nsay, if, because at this moment, apart from the presence of the ladder\nand his vacant room, there are no evidences which permit me even to\nsuspect him)--if he is there, he has been obliged to pass by the ladder,\nand the rooms which lie behind his, in his new lodging, are occupied by\nthe family of the steward and by the cook, and by the kitchens, which\nbar the way by the vestibule to the interior of the chateau. And if he\nhad been there during the evening on any pretext, it would have been\neasy for him to go into the gallery and see that the window could be\nsimply pushed open from the outside. This question of the unfastened\nwindow easily narrowed the field of search for the murderer. He must\nbelong to the house, unless he had an accomplice, which I do not believe\nhe had; unless--unless Mademoiselle Stangerson herself had seen that\nthat window was not fastened from the inside. But, then,--what could\nbe the frightful secret which put her under the necessity of doing away\nwith obstacles that separated her from the murderer?\n\n\"I seized hold of the ladder, and we returned to the back of the chateau\nto see if the window of the chamber was still half-open. The blind was\ndrawn but did not join and allowed a bright stream of light to escape\nand fall upon the path at our feet. I planted the ladder under the\nwindow. I am almost sure that I made no noise; and while Daddy Jacques\nremained at the foot of the ladder, I mounted it, very quietly, my stout\nstick in my hand. I held my breath and lifted my feet with the greatest\ncare. Suddenly a heavy cloud discharged itself at that moment in a fresh\ndownpour of rain.\n\n\"At the same instant the sinister cry of the Bete du bon Dieu arrested\nme in my ascent. It seemed to me to have come from close by me--only a\nfew yards away. Was the cry a signal?--Had some accomplice of the\nman seen me on the ladder!--Would the cry bring the man to the\nwindow?--Perhaps! Ah, there he was at the window! I felt his head above\nme. I heard the sound of his breath! I could not look up towards him;\nthe least movement of my head, and--I might be lost. Would he see\nme?--Would he peer into the darkness? No; he went away. He had seen\nnothing. I felt, rather than heard, him moving on tip-toe in the room;\nand I mounted a few steps higher. My head reached to the level of the\nwindow-sill; my forehead rose above it; my eyes looked between\nthe opening in the blinds--and I saw--A man seated at Mademoiselle\nStangerson's little desk, writing. His back was turned toward me. A\ncandle was lit before him, and he bent over the flame, the light from\nit projecting shapeless shadows. I saw nothing but a monstrous, stooping\nback.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson herself was not there!--Her bed had not been\nlain on! Where, then, was she sleeping that night? Doubtless in the\nside-room with her women. Perhaps this was but a guess. I must content\nmyself with the joy of finding the man alone. I must be calm to prepare\nmy trap.\n\n\"But who, then, is this man writing there before my eyes, seated at the\ndesk, as if he were in his own home? If there had not been that ladder\nunder the window; if there had not been those footprints on the carpet\nin the gallery; if there had not been that open window, I might have\nbeen led to think that this man had a right to be there, and that he was\nthere as a matter of course and for reasons about which as yet I knew\nnothing. But there was no doubt that this mysterious unknown was the\nman of The Yellow Room,--the man to whose murderous assault Mademoiselle\nStangerson--without denouncing him--had had to submit. If I could but\nsee his face! Surprise and capture him!\n\n\"If I spring into the room at this moment, he will escape by the\nright-hand door opening into the boudoir,--or crossing the drawing-room,\nhe will reach the gallery and I shall lose him. I have him now and in\nfive minutes more he'll be safer than if I had him in a cage.--What is\nhe doing there, alone in Mademoiselle Stangerson's room?--What is he\nwriting? I descend and place the ladder on the ground. Daddy Jacques\nfollows me. We re-enter the chateau. I send Daddy Jacques to wake\nMonsieur Stangerson, and instruct him to await my coming in Mademoiselle\nStangerson's room and to say nothing definite to him before my arrival.\nI will go and awaken Frederic Larsan. It's a bore to have to do it, for\nI should have liked to work alone and to have carried off all the\nhonors of this affair myself, right under the very nose of the sleeping\ndetective. But Daddy Jacques and Monsieur Stangerson are old men, and I\nam not yet fully developed. I might not be strong enough. Larsan is used\nto wrestling and putting on the handcuffs. He opened his eyes swollen\nwith sleep, ready to send me flying, without in the least believing in\nmy reporter's fancies. I had to assure him that the man was there!\n\n\"'That's strange!' he said; 'I thought I left him this afternoon in\nParis.'\n\n\"He dressed himself in haste and armed himself with a revolver. We stole\nquietly into the gallery.\n\n\"'Where is he?' Larsan asked.\n\n\"'In Mademoiselle Stangerson's room.\n\n\"'And--Mademoiselle Stangerson?'\n\n\"'She is not in there.'\n\n\"'Let's go in.'\n\n\"'Don't go there! On the least alarm the man will escape. He has four\nways by which to do it--the door, the window, the boudoir, or the room\nin which the women are sleeping.'\n\n\"'I'll draw him from below.'\n\n\"'And if you fail?--If you only succeed in wounding him--he'll escape\nagain, without reckoning that he is certainly armed. No, let me direct\nthe expedition, and I'll answer for everything.'\n\n\"'As you like,' he replied, with fairly good grace.\n\n\"Then, after satisfying myself that all the windows of the two galleries\nwere thoroughly secure, I placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the\n'off-turning' gallery, before the window which I had found open and had\nreclosed.\n\n\"'Under no consideration,' I said to him, 'must you stir from this post\ntill I call you. The chances are even that the man, when he is pursued,\nwill return to this window and try to save himself that way; for it is\nby that way he came in and made a way ready for his flight. You have a\ndangerous post.'\n\n\"'What will be yours?' asked Fred.\n\n\"'I shall spring into the room and knock him over for you.'\n\n\"'Take my revolver,' said Fred, 'and I'll take your stick.'\n\n\"'Thanks,' I said; 'You are a brave man.'\n\n\"I accepted his offer. I was going to be alone with the man in the room\nwriting and was really thankful to have the weapon.\n\n\"I left Fred, having posted him at the window (No. 5 on the plan),\nand, with the greatest precaution, went towards Monsieur Stangerson's\napartment in the left wing of the chateau. I found him with Daddy\nJacques, who had faithfully obeyed my directions, confining himself\nto asking his master to dress as quickly as possible. In a few words I\nexplained to Monsieur Stangerson what was passing. He armed himself with\na revolver, followed me, and we were all three speedily in the gallery.\nSince I had seen the murderer seated at the desk ten minutes had\nelapsed. Monsieur Stangerson wished to spring upon the assassin at once\nand kill him. I made him understand that, above all, he must not, in his\ndesire to kill him, miss him.\n\n\"When I had sworn to him that his daughter was not in the room, and\nin no danger, he conquered his impatience and left me to direct the\noperations. I told them that they must come to me the moment I called\nto them, or when I fired my revolver. I then sent Daddy Jacques to place\nhimself before the window at the end of the 'right' gallery. (No. 2 on\nmy plan.) I chose that position 'for Daddy Jacques because I believed\nthat the murderer, tracked, on leaving the room, would run through the\ngallery towards the window which he had left open, and, instantly seeing\nthat it was guarded by Larsan, would pursue his course along the 'right'\ngallery. There he would encounter Daddy Jacques, who would prevent his\nspringing out of the window into the park. Under that window there was\na sort of buttress, while all the other windows in the galleries were at\nsuch a height from the ground that it was almost impossible to jump from\nthem without breaking one's neck. All the doors and windows, including\nthose of the lumber-room at the end of the 'right' gallery--as I had\nrapidly assured myself--were strongly secured.\n\n\"Having indicated to Daddy Jacques the post he was to occupy, and having\nseen him take up his position, I placed Monsieur Stangerson on\nthe landing at the head of the stairs not far from the door of his\ndaughter's ante-room, rather than the boudoir, where the women were,\nand the door of which must have been locked by Mademoiselle Stangerson\nherself if, as I thought, she had taken refuge in the boudoir for the\npurpose of avoiding the murderer who was coming to see her. In any case,\nhe must return to the gallery where my people were awaiting him at every\npossible exit.\n\n\"On coming there, he would see on his left, Monsieur Stangerson; he\nwould turn to the right, towards the 'off-turning' gallery--the way\nhe had pre-arranged for flight, where, at the intersection of the two\ngalleries, he would see at once, as I have explained, on his left,\nFrederic Larsan at the end of the 'off-turning' gallery, and in front,\nDaddy Jacques, at the end of the 'right' gallery. Monsieur Stangerson\nand myself would arrive by way of the back of the chateau.--He is\nours!--He can no longer escape us! I was sure of that.\n\n\"The plan I had formed seemed to me the best, the surest, and the most\nsimple. It would, no doubt, have been simpler still, if we had been able\nto place some one directly behind the door of Mademoiselle's boudoir,\nwhich opened out of her bedchamber, and, in that way, had been in a\nposition to besiege the two doors of the room in which the man was. But\nwe could not penetrate the boudoir except by way of the drawing-room,\nthe door of which had been locked on the inside by Mademoiselle\nStangerson. But even if I had had the free disposition of the boudoir,\nI should have held to the plan I had formed; because any other plan of\nattack would have separated us at the moment of the struggle with the\nman, while my plan united us all for the attack, at a spot which I had\nselected with almost mathematical precision,--the intersection of the\ntwo galleries.\n\n\"Having so placed my people, I again left the chateau, hurried to my\nladder, and, replacing it, climbed up, revolver in hand.\n\n\"If there be any inclined to smile at my taking so many precautionary\nmeasures, I refer them to the mystery of The Yellow Room, and to all the\nproofs we have of the weird cunning of the murderer. Further, if there\nbe some who think my observations needlessly minute at a moment when\nthey ought to be completely held by rapidity of movement and decision\nof action, I reply that I have wished to report here, at length and\ncompletely, all the details of a plan of attack conceived so rapidly\nthat it is only the slowness of my pen that gives an appearance\nof slowness to the execution. I have wished, by this slowness and\nprecision, to be certain that nothing should be omitted from the\nconditions under which the strange phenomenon was produced, which, until\nsome natural explanation of it is forthcoming, seems to me to prove,\neven better than the theories of Professor Stangerson, the Dissociation\nof Matter--I will even say, the instantaneous Dissociation of Matter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. Strange Phenomenon of the Dissociation of Matter\n\n\n(EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\n\n\"I am again at the window-sill,\" continues Rouletabille, \"and once\nmore I raise my head above it. Through an opening in the curtains, the\narrangement of which has not been changed, I am ready to look, anxious\nto note the position in which I am going to find the murderer,--whether\nhis back will still be turned towards me!--whether he is still seated at\nthe desk writing! But perhaps--perhaps--he is no longer there!--Yet\nhow could he have fled?--Was I not in possession of his ladder? I force\nmyself to be cool. I raise my head yet higher. I look--he is still\nthere. I see his monstrous back, deformed by the shadow thrown by the\ncandle. He is no longer writing now, and the candle is on the parquet,\nover which he is bending--a position which serves my purpose.\n\n\"I hold my breath. I mount the ladder. I am on the uppermost rung of it,\nand with my left hand seize hold of the window-sill. In this moment of\napproaching success, I feel my heart beating wildly. I put my revolver\nbetween my teeth. A quick spring, and I shall be on the window-ledge.\nBut--the ladder! I had been obliged to press on it heavily, and my foot\nhad scarcely left it, when I felt it swaying beneath me. It grated on\nthe wall and fell. But, already, my knees were touching the window-sill,\nand, by a movement quick as lightning, I got on to it.\n\n\"But the murderer had been even quicker than I had been. He had heard\nthe grating of the ladder on the wall, and I saw the monstrous back of\nthe man raise itself. I saw his head. Did I really see it?--The candle\non the parquet lit up his legs only. Above the height of the table\nthe chamber was in darkness. I saw a man with long hair, a full beard,\nwild-looking eyes, a pale face, framed in large whiskers,--as well as\nI could distinguish, and, as I think--red in colour. I did not know the\nface. That was, in brief, the chief sensation I received from that\nface in the dim half-light in which I saw it. I did not know it--or, at\nleast, I did not recognise it.\n\n\"Now for quick action! It was indeed time for that, for as I was about\nto place my legs through the window, the man had seen me, had bounded\nto his feet, had sprung--as I foresaw he would--to the door of the\nante-chamber, had time to open it, and fled. But I was already behind\nhim, revolver in hand, shouting 'Help!'\n\n\"Like an arrow I crossed the room, but noticed a letter on the table\nas I rushed. I almost came up with the man in the ante-room, for he had\nlost time in opening the door to the gallery. I flew on wings, and in\nthe gallery was but a few feet behind him. He had taken, as I supposed\nhe would, the gallery on his right,--that is to say, the road he had\nprepared for his flight. 'Help, Jacques!--help, Larsan!' I cried. He\ncould not escape us! I raised a shout of joy, of savage victory. The man\nreached the intersection of the two galleries hardly two seconds before\nme for the meeting which I had prepared--the fatal shock which\nmust inevitably take place at that spot! We all rushed to the\ncrossing-place--Monsieur Stangerson and I coming from one end of the\nright gallery, Daddy Jacques coming from the other end of the same\ngallery, and Frederic Larsan coming from the 'off-turning' gallery.\n\n\"The man was not there!\n\n\"We looked at each other stupidly and with eyes terrified. The man had\nvanished like a ghost. 'Where is he--where is he?' we all asked.\n\n\"'It is impossible he can have escaped!' I cried, my terror mastered by\nmy anger.\n\n\"'I touched him!' exclaimed Frederic Larsan.\n\n\"'I felt his breath on my face!' cried Daddy Jacques.\n\n\"'Where is he?'--where is he?' we all cried.\n\n\"We raced like madmen along the two galleries; we visited doors and\nwindows--they were closed, hermetically closed. They had not been\nopened. Besides, the opening of a door or window by this man whom we\nwere hunting, without our having perceived it, would have been more\ninexplicable than his disappearance.\n\n\"Where is he?--where is he?--He could not have got away by a door or\na window, nor by any other way. He could not have passed through our\nbodies!\n\n\"I confess that, for the moment, I felt 'done for.' For the gallery was\nperfectly lighted, and there was neither trap, nor secret door in the\nwalls, nor any sort of hiding-place. We moved the chairs and lifted the\npictures. Nothing!--nothing! We would have looked into a flower-pot, if\nthere had been one to look into!\"\n\nWhen this mystery, thanks to Rouletabille, was naturally explained, by\nthe help alone of his masterful mind, we were able to realise that the\nmurderer had got away neither by a door, a window, nor the stairs--a\nfact which the judges would not admit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. The Inexplicable Gallery\n\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared at the door of her ante-room,\"\ncontinues Rouletabille's note-book. \"We were near her door in the\ngallery where this incredible phenomenon had taken place. There are\nmoments when one feels as if one's brain were about to burst. A bullet\nin the head, a fracture of the skull, the seat of reason shattered--with\nonly these can I compare the sensation which exhausted and left me void\nof sense.\n\n\"Happily, Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of her\nante-room. I saw her, and that helped to relieve my chaotic state of\nmind. I breathed her--I inhaled the perfume of the lady in black, whom I\nshould never see again. I would have given ten years of my life--half my\nlife--to see once more the lady in black! Alas! I no more meet her\nbut from time to time,--and yet!--and yet! how the memory of that\nperfume--felt by me alone--carries me back to the days of my childhood.*\nIt was this sharp reminder from my beloved perfume, of the lady in\nblack, which made me go to her--dressed wholly in white and so pale--so\npale and so beautiful!--on the threshold of the inexplicable gallery.\nHer beautiful golden hair, gathered into a knot on the back of her neck,\nleft visible the red star on her temple which had so nearly been the\ncause of her death. When I first got on the right track of the mystery\nof this case I had imagined that, on the night of the tragedy in The\nYellow Room, Mademoiselle Stangerson had worn her hair in bands. But\nthen, how could I have imagined otherwise when I had not been in\nThe Yellow Room!\n\n     * When I wrote these lines, Joseph Rouletabille was eighteen\n     years of age,--and he spoke of his \"youth.\" I have kept the\n     text of my friend, but I inform the reader here that the\n     episode of the mystery of The Yellow Room has no connection\n     with that of the perfume of the lady in black. It is not my\n     fault if, in the document which I have cited, Rouletabille\n     thought fit to refer to his childhood.\n\n\"But now, since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery, I did not\nreason at all. I stood there, stupid, before the apparition--so pale\nand so beautiful--of Mademoiselle Stangerson. She was clad in a\ndressing-gown of dreamy white. One might have taken her to be a\nghost--a lovely phantom. Her father took her in his arms and kissed her\npassionately, as if he had recovered her after being long lost to him.\nI dared not question her. He drew her into the room and we followed\nthem,--for we had to know!--The door of the boudoir was open. The\nterrified faces of the two nurses craned towards us. Mademoiselle\nStangerson inquired the meaning of all the disturbance. That she was\nnot in her own room was quite easily explained--quite easily. She had\na fancy not to sleep that night in her chamber, but in the boudoir with\nher nurses, locking the door on them. Since the night of the crime she\nhad experienced feelings of terror, and fears came over her that are\neasily to be comprehended.\n\n\"But who could imagine that on that particular night when he was to\ncome, she would, by a mere chance, determine to shut herself in with her\nwomen? Who would think that she would act contrary to her father's wish\nto sleep in the drawing-room? Who could believe that the letter which\nhad so recently been on the table in her room would no longer be there?\nHe who could understand all this, would have to assume that Mademoiselle\nStangerson knew that the murderer was coming--she could not prevent\nhis coming again--unknown to her father, unknown to all but to Monsieur\nRobert Darzac. For he must know it now--perhaps he had known it before!\nDid he remember that phrase in the Elysee garden: 'Must I commit a\ncrime, then, to win you?' Against whom the crime, if not against the\nobstacle, against the murderer? 'Ah, I would kill him with my own hand!'\nAnd I replied, 'You have not answered my question.' That was the very\ntruth. In truth, in truth, Monsieur Darzac knew the murderer so well\nthat--while wishing to kill him himself--he was afraid I should find\nhim. There could be but two reasons why he had assisted me in my\ninvestigation. First, because I forced him to do it; and, second,\nbecause she would be the better protected.\n\n\"I am in the chamber--her room. I look at her, also at the place where\nthe letter had just now been. She has possessed herself of it; it was\nevidently intended for her--evidently. How she trembles!--Trembles at\nthe strange story her father is telling her, of the presence of the\nmurderer in her chamber, and of the pursuit. But it is plainly to be\nseen that she is not wholly satisfied by the assurance given her until\nshe had been told that the murderer, by some incomprehensible means, had\nbeen able to elude us.\n\n\"Then follows a silence. What a silence! We are all there--looking at\nher--her father, Larsan, Daddy Jacques and I. What were we all thinking\nof in the silence? After the events of that night, of the mystery of\nthe inexplicable gallery, of the prodigious fact of the presence of the\nmurderer in her room, it seemed to me that all our thoughts might have\nbeen translated into the words which were addressed to her. 'You who\nknow of this mystery, explain it to us, and we shall perhaps be able\nto save you. How I longed to save her--for herself, and, from the\nother!--It brought the tears to my eyes.\n\n\"She is there, shedding about her the perfume of the lady in black. At\nlast, I see her, in the silence of her chamber. Since the fatal hour of\nthe mystery of The Yellow Room, we have hung about this invisible and\nsilent woman to learn what she knows. Our desires, our wish to know must\nbe a torment to her. Who can tell that, should we learn the secret of\nher mystery, it would not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that\nwhich had already been enacted here? Who can tell if it might not mean\nher death? Yet it had brought her close to death,--and we still knew\nnothing. Or, rather, there are some of us who know nothing. But I--if I\nknew who, I should know all. Who?--Who?--Not knowing who, I must remain\nsilent, out of pity for her. For there is no doubt that she knows how he\nescaped from The Yellow Room, and yet she keeps the secret. When I know\nwho, I will speak to him--to him!\"\n\n\"She looked at us now--with a far-away look in her eyes--as if we were\nnot in the chamber. Monsieur Stangerson broke the silence. He declared\nthat, henceforth, he would no more absent himself from his daughter's\napartments. She tried to oppose him in vain. He adhered firmly to his\npurpose. He would install himself there this very night, he said. Solely\nconcerned for the health of his daughter, he reproached her for having\nleft her bed. Then he suddenly began talking to her as if she were a\nlittle child. He smiled at her and seemed not to know either what\nhe said or what he did. The illustrious professor had lost his\nhead. Mademoiselle Stangerson in a tone of tender distress said:\n'Father!--father!' Daddy Jacques blows his nose, and Frederic Larsan\nhimself is obliged to turn away to hide his emotion. For myself, I am\nable neither to think or feel. I felt an infinite contempt for myself.\n\n\"It was the first time that Frederic Larsan, like myself, found himself\nface to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the attack in The Yellow\nRoom. Like me, he had insisted on being allowed to question the unhappy\nlady; but he had not, any more than had I, been permitted. To him, as to\nme, the same answer had always been given: Mademoiselle Stangerson was\ntoo weak to receive us. The questionings of the examining magistrate\nhad over-fatigued her. It was evidently intended not to give us any\nassistance in our researches. I was not surprised; but Frederic Larsan\nhad always resented this conduct. It is true that he and I had a totally\ndifferent theory of the crime.\n\n\"I still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart: 'Save\nher!--save her without his speaking!' Who is he--the murderer? Take him\nand shut his mouth. But Monsieur Darzac made it clear that in order to\nshut his mouth he must be killed. Have I the right to kill Mademoiselle\nStangerson's murderer? No, I had not. But let him only give me the\nchance! Let me find out whether he is really a creature of flesh and\nblood!--Let me see his dead body, since it cannot be taken alive.\n\n\"If I could but make this woman, who does not even look at us,\nunderstand! She is absorbed by her fears and by her father's distress of\nmind. And I can do nothing to save her. Yes, I will go to work once more\nand accomplish wonders.\n\n\"I move towards her. I would speak to her. I would entreat her to\nhave confidence in me. I would, in a word, make her understand--she\nalone--that I know how the murderer escaped from The Yellow Room--that\nI have guessed the motives for her secrecy--and that I pity her with\nall my heart. But by her gestures she begged us to leave her alone,\nexpressing weariness and the need for immediate rest. Monsieur\nStangerson asked us to go back to our rooms and thanked us. Frederic\nLarsan and I bowed to him and, followed by Daddy Jacques, we regained\nthe gallery. I heard Larsan murmur: 'Strange! strange!' He made a sign\nto me to go with him into his room. On the threshold he turned towards\nDaddy Jacques.\n\n\"'Did you see him distinctly?' he asked.\n\n\"'Who?'\n\n\"'The man?'\n\n\"'Saw him!--why, he had a big red beard and red hair.'\n\n\"'That's how he appeared to me,' I said.\n\n\"'And to me,' said Larsan.\n\n\"The great Fred and I were alone in his chamber, now, to talk over this\nthing. We talked for an hour, turning the matter over and viewing it\nfrom every side. From the questions put by him, from the explanation\nwhich he gives me, it is clear to me that--in spite of all our\nsenses--he is persuaded the man disappeared by some secret passage in\nthe chateau known to him alone.\n\n\"'He knows the chateau,' he said to me; 'he knows it well.'\n\n\"'He is a rather tall man--well-built,' I suggested.\n\n\"'He is as tall as he wants to be,' murmured Fred.\n\n\"'I understand,' I said; 'but how do you account for his red hair and\nbeard?'\n\n\"'Too much beard--too much hair--false,' says Fred.\n\n\"'That's easily said. You are always thinking of Robert Darzac. You\ncan't get rid of that idea? I am certain that he is innocent.'\n\n\"'So much the better. I hope so; but everything condemns him. Did you\nnotice the marks on the carpet?--Come and look at them.'\n\n\"'I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the same as\nthose we saw on the border of the lake.'\n\n\"'Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac?'\n\n\"'Of course, one may be mistaken.'\n\n\"'Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one direction?--that\nthere are no return marks? When the man came from the chamber, pursued\nby all of us, his footsteps left no traces behind them.'\n\n\"'He had, perhaps, been in the chamber for hours. The mud from his boots\nhad dried, and he moved with such rapidity on the points of his toes--We\nsaw him running, but we did not hear his steps.'\n\n\"I suddenly put an end to this idle chatter--void of any logic, and made\na sign to Larsan to listen.\n\n\"'There--below; some one is shutting a door.'\n\n\"I rise; Larsan follows me; we descend to the ground-floor of the\nchateau. I lead him to the little semi-circular room under the terrace\nbeneath the window of the 'off-turning' gallery. I point to the door,\nnow closed, open a short time before, under which a shaft of light is\nvisible.\n\n\"'The forest-keeper!' says Fred.\n\n\"'Come on!' I whisper.\n\n\"Prepared--I know not why--to believe that the keeper is the guilty\nman--I go to the door and rap smartly on it. Some might think that we\nwere rather late in thinking of the keeper, since our first business,\nafter having found that the murderer had escaped us in the gallery,\nought to have been to search everywhere else,--around the chateau,--in\nthe park--\n\n\"Had this criticism been made at the time, we could only have answered\nthat the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in such a way that we\nthought he was no longer anywhere! He had eluded us when we all had our\nhands stretched out ready to seize him--when we were almost touching\nhim. We had no longer any ground for hoping that we could clear up the\nmystery of that night.\n\n\"As soon as I rapped at the door it was opened, and the keeper asked us\nquietly what we wanted. He was undressed and preparing to go to bed. The\nbed had not yet been disturbed.\n\n\"We entered and I affected surprise.\n\n\"'Not gone to bed yet?'\n\n\"'No,' he replied roughly. 'I have been making a round of the park and\nin the woods. I am only just back--and sleepy. Good-night!'\n\n\"'Listen,' I said. 'An hour or so ago, there was a ladder close by your\nwindow.'\n\n\"'What ladder?--I did not see any ladder. Good-night!'\n\n\"And he simply put us out of the room. When we were outside I looked at\nLarsan. His face was impenetrable.\n\n\"'Well?' I said.\n\n\"'Well?' he repeated.\n\n\"'Does that open out any new view to you?'\n\n\"There was no mistaking Larsan's bad temper. On re-entering the chateau,\nI heard him mutter:\n\n\"'It would be strange--very strange--if I had deceived myself on that\npoint!'\n\n\"He seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself. He added: 'In\nany case, we shall soon know what to think. The morning will bring light\nwith it.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. Rouletabille Has Drawn a Circle Between the Two Bumps on\nHis Forehead\n\n\n(EXTRACT FROM THE NOTE-BOOK OF JOSEPH ROULETABILLE, continued)\n\n\"We separated on the thresholds of our rooms, with a melancholy shake of\nthe hands. I was glad to have aroused in him a suspicion of error. His\nwas an original brain, very intelligent but--without method. I did not\ngo to bed. I awaited the coming of daylight and then went down to\nthe front of the chateau, and made a detour, examining every trace of\nfootsteps coming towards it or going from it. These, however, were so\nmixed and confusing that I could make nothing of them. Here I may make\na remark,--I am not accustomed to attach an exaggerated importance to\nexterior signs left in the track of a crime.\n\n\"The method which traces the criminal by means of the tracks of his\nfootsteps is altogether primitive. So many footprints are identical.\nHowever, in the disturbed state of my mind, I did go into the deserted\ncourt and did look at all the footprints I could find there, seeking for\nsome indication, as a basis for reasoning.\n\n\"If I could but find a right starting-point! In despair I seated myself\non a stone. For over an hour I busied myself with the common, ordinary\nwork of a policeman. Like the least intelligent of detectives I went on\nblindly over the traces of footprints which told me just no more than\nthey could.\n\n\"I came to the conclusion that I was a fool, lower in the scale of\nintelligence than even the police of the modern romancer. Novelists\nbuild mountains of stupidity out of a footprint on the sand, or from\nan impression of a hand on the wall. That's the way innocent men are\nbrought to prison. It might convince an examining magistrate or the head\nof a detective department, but it's not proof. You writers forget that\nwhat the senses furnish is not proof. If I am taking cognisance of what\nis offered me by my senses I do so but to bring the results within the\ncircle of my reason. That circle may be the most circumscribed, but if\nit is, it has this advantage--it holds nothing but the truth! Yes, I\nswear that I have never used the evidence of the senses but as servants\nto my reason. I have never permitted them to become my master. They have\nnot made of me that monstrous thing,--worse than a blind man,--a man\nwho sees falsely. And that is why I can triumph over your error and your\nmerely animal intelligence, Frederic Larsan.\n\n\"Be of good courage, then, friend Rouletabille; it is impossible that\nthe incident of the inexplicable gallery should be outside the circle\nof your reason. You know that! Then have faith and take thought with\nyourself and forget not that you took hold of the right end when you\ndrew that circle in your brain within which to unravel this mysterious\nplay of circumstance.\n\n\"To it, once again! Go--back to the gallery. Take your stand on your\nreason and rest there as Frederic Larsan rests on his cane. You will\nthen soon prove that the great Fred is nothing but a fool.\n\n--30th October. Noon.\n\nJOSEPH ROULETABILLE.\"\n\n\n\"I acted as I planned. With head on fire, I retraced my way to the\ngallery, and without having found anything more than I had seen on\nthe previous night, the right hold I had taken of my reason drew me to\nsomething so important that I was obliged to cling to it to save myself\nfrom falling.\n\n\"Now for the strength and patience to find sensible traces to fit in\nwith my thinking--and these must come within the circle I have drawn\nbetween the two bumps on my forehead!\n\n--30th of October. Midnight.\"\n\n\"JOSEPH ROULETABILLE.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. Rouletabille Invites Me to Breakfast at the Donjon Inn\n\n\nIt was not until later that Rouletabille sent me the note-book in which\nhe had written at length the story of the phenomenon of the inexplicable\ngallery. On the day I arrived at the Glandier and joined him in his\nroom, he recounted to me, with the greatest detail, all that I have now\nrelated, telling me also how he had spent several hours in Paris where\nhe had learned nothing that could be of any help to him.\n\nThe event of the inexplicable gallery had occurred on the night between\nthe 29th and 30th of October, that is to say, three days before my\nreturn to the chateau. It was on the 2nd of November, then, that I went\nback to the Glandier, summoned there by my friend's telegram, and taking\nthe revolvers with me.\n\nI am now in Rouletabille's room and he has finished his recital.\n\nWhile he had been telling me the story I noticed him continually rubbing\nthe glass of the eyeglasses he had found on the side table. From the\nevident pleasure he was taking in handling them I felt they must be one\nof those sensible evidences destined to enter what he had called the\ncircle of the right end of his reason. That strange and unique way of\nhis, to express himself in terms wonderfully adequate for his thoughts,\nno longer surprised me. It was often necessary to know his thought to\nunderstand the terms he used; and it was not easy to penetrate into\nRouletabille's thinking.\n\nThis lad's brain was one of the most curious things I have ever\nobserved. Rouletabille went on the even tenor of his way without\nsuspecting the astonishment and even bewilderment he roused in others. I\nam sure he was not himself in the least conscious of the originality of\nhis genius. He was himself and at ease wherever he happened to be.\n\nWhen he had finished his recital he asked me what I thought of it. I\nreplied that I was much puzzled by his question. Then he begged me to\ntry, in my turn, to take my reason in hand \"by the right end.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said. \"It seems to me that the point of departure of\nmy reason would be this--there can be no doubt that the murderer you\npursued was in the gallery.\" I paused.\n\n\"After making so good a start, you ought not to stop so soon,\" he\nexclaimed. \"Come, make another effort.\"\n\n\"I'll try. Since he disappeared from the gallery without passing through\nany door or window, he must have escaped by some other opening.\"\n\nRouletabille looked at me pityingly, smiled carelessly, and remarked\nthat I was reasoning like a postman, or--like Frederic Larsan.\n\nRouletabille had alternate fits of admiration and disdain for the great\nFred. It all depended as to whether Larsan's discoveries tallied with\nRouletabille's reasoning or not. When they did he would exclaim: \"He\nis really great!\" When they did not he would grunt and mutter, \"What an\nass!\" It was a petty side of the noble character of this strange youth.\n\nWe had risen, and he led me into the park. When we reached the court and\nwere making towards the gate, the sound of blinds thrown back against\nthe wall made us turn our heads, and we saw, at a window on the first\nfloor of the chateau, the ruddy and clean shaven face of a person I did\nnot recognise.\n\n\"Hullo!\" muttered Rouletabille. \"Arthur Rance!\"--He lowered his head,\nquickened his pace, and I heard him ask himself between his teeth: \"Was\nhe in the chateau that night? What is he doing here?\"\n\nWe had gone some distance from the chateau when I asked him who this\nArthur Rance was, and how he had come to know him. He referred to his\nstory of that morning and I remembered that Mr. Arthur W. Rance was the\nAmerican from Philadelphia with whom he had had so many drinks at the\nElysee reception.\n\n\"But was he not to have left France almost immediately?\" I asked.\n\n\"No doubt; that's why I am surprised to find him here still, and not\nonly in France, but above all, at the Glandier. He did not arrive this\nmorning; and he did not get here last night. He must have got here\nbefore dinner, then. Why didn't the concierges tell me?\"\n\nI reminded my friend, apropos of the concierges, that he had not yet\ntold me what had led him to get them set at liberty.\n\nWe were close to their lodge. Monsieur and Madame Bernier saw us coming.\nA frank smile lit up their happy faces. They seemed to harbour no\nill-feeling because of their detention. My young friend asked them at\nwhat hour Mr. Arthur Rance had arrived. They answered that they did not\nknow he was at the chateau. He must have come during the evening of the\nprevious night, but they had not had to open the gate for him, because,\nbeing a great walker, and not wishing that a carriage should be sent\nto meet him, he was accustomed to get off at the little hamlet of\nSaint-Michel, from which he came to the chateau by way of the forest. He\nreached the park by the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, over the little gate\nof which, giving on to the park, he climbed.\n\nAs the concierges spoke, I saw Rouletabille's face cloud over and\nexhibit disappointment--a disappointment, no doubt, with himself.\nEvidently he was a little vexed, after having worked so much on the\nspot, with so minute a study of the people and events at the Glandier,\nthat he had to learn now that Arthur Rance was accustomed to visit the\nchateau.\n\n\"You say that Monsieur Arthur Rance is accustomed to come to the\nchateau. When did he come here last?\"\n\n\"We can't tell you exactly,\" replied Madame Bernier--that was the\nname of the concierge--\"we couldn't know while they were keeping us in\nprison. Besides, as the gentleman comes to the chateau without passing\nthrough our gate he goes away by the way he comes.\"\n\n\"Do you know when he came the first time?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Monsieur!--nine years ago.\"\n\n\"He was in France nine years ago, then,\" said Rouletabille, \"and,\nsince that time, as far as you know, how many times has he been at the\nGlandier?\"\n\n\"Three times.\"\n\n\"When did he come the last time, as far as you know?\"\n\n\"A week before the attempt in The Yellow Room.\"\n\nRouletabille put another question--this time addressing himself\nparticularly to the woman:\n\n\"In the grove of the parquet?\"\n\n\"In the grove of the parquet,\" she replied.\n\n\"Thanks!\" said Rouletabille. \"Be ready for me this evening.\"\n\nHe spoke the last words with a finger on his lips as if to command\nsilence and discretion.\n\nWe left the park and took the way to the Donjon Inn.\n\n\"Do you often eat here?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"But you also take your meals at the chateau?\"\n\n\"Yes, Larsan and I are sometimes served in one of our rooms.\"\n\n\"Hasn't Monsieur Stangerson ever invited you to his own table?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Does your presence at the chateau displease him?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but, in any case, he does not make us feel that we are in\nhis way.\"\n\n\"Doesn't he question you?\"\n\n\"Never. He is in the same state of mind as he was in at the door of The\nYellow Room when his daughter was being murdered, and when he broke open\nthe door and did not find the murderer. He is persuaded, since he\ncould discover nothing, that there's no reason why we should be able\nto discover more than he did. But he has made it his duty, since Larsan\nexpressed his theory, not to oppose us.\"\n\nRouletabille buried himself in thought again for some time. He aroused\nhimself later to tell me of how he came to set the two concierges free.\n\n\"I went recently to see Monsieur Stangerson, and took with me a piece of\npaper on which was written: 'I promise, whatever others may say, to\nkeep in my service my two faithful servants, Bernier and his wife.' I\nexplained to him that, by signing that document, he would enable me to\ncompel those two people to speak out; and I declared my own assurance of\ntheir innocence of any part in the crime. That was also his opinion. The\nexamining magistrate, after it was signed, presented the document to the\nBerniers, who then did speak. They said, what I was certain they would\nsay, as soon as they were sure they would not lose their place.\n\n\"They confessed to poaching on Monsieur Stangerson's estates, and it\nwas while they were poaching, on the night of the crime, that they were\nfound not far from the pavilion at the moment when the outrage was being\ncommitted. Some rabbits they caught in that way were sold by them to the\nlandlord of the Donjon Inn, who served them to his customers, or sent\nthem to Paris. That was the truth, as I had guessed from the first. Do\nyou remember what I said, on entering the Donjon Inn?--'We shall have\nto eat red meat--now!' I had heard the words on the same morning when\nwe arrived at the park gate. You heard them also, but you did not attach\nany importance to them. You recollect, when we reached the park gate,\nthat we stopped to look at a man who was running by the side of the\nwall, looking every minute at his watch. That was Larsan. Well, behind\nus the landlord of the Donjon Inn, standing on his doorstep, said to\nsomeone inside: 'We shall have to eat red meat--now.'\n\n\"Why that 'now'? When you are, as I am, in search of some hidden secret,\nyou can't afford to have anything escape you. You've got to know the\nmeaning of everything. We had come into a rather out-of-the-way part of\nthe country which had been turned topsy-turvey by a crime, and my reason\nled me to suspect every phrase that could bear upon the event of the\nday. 'Now,' I took to mean, 'since the outrage.' In the course of my\ninquiry, therefore, I sought to find a relation between that phrase and\nthe tragedy. We went to the Donjon Inn for breakfast; I repeated the\nphrase and saw, by the surprise and trouble on Daddy Mathieu's face,\nthat I had not exaggerated its importance, so far as he was concerned.\n\n\"I had just learned that the concierges had been arrested. Daddy Mathieu\nspoke of them as of dear friends--people for whom one is sorry. That\nwas a reckless conjunction of ideas, I said to myself. 'Now,' that\nthe concierges are arrested, 'we shall have to eat red meat.' No more\nconcierges, no more game! The hatred expressed by Daddy Mathieu for\nMonsieur Stangerson's forest-keeper--a hatred he pretended was shared\nby the concierges led me easily to think of poaching. Now as all the\nevidence showed the concierges had not been in bed at the time of the\ntragedy, why were they abroad that night? As participants in the crime?\nI was not disposed to think so. I had already arrived at the conclusion,\nby steps of which I will tell you later--that the assassin had had no\naccomplice, and that the tragedy held a mystery between Mademoiselle\nStangerson and the murderer, a mystery with which the concierges had\nnothing to do.\n\n\"With that theory in my mind, I searched for proof in their lodge,\nwhich, as you know, I entered. I found there under their bed, some\nsprings and brass wire. 'Ah!' I thought, 'these things explain why\nthey were out in the park at night!' I was not surprised at the dogged\nsilence they maintained before the examining magistrate, even under the\naccusation so grave as that of being accomplices in the crime. Poaching\nwould save them from the Assize Court, but it would lose them their\nplaces; and, as they were perfectly sure of their innocence of the crime\nthey hoped it would soon be established, and then their poaching might\ngo on as usual. They could always confess later. I, however, hastened\ntheir confession by means of the document Monsieur Stangerson signed.\nThey gave all the necessary 'proofs,' were set at liberty, and have\nnow a lively gratitude for me. Why did I not get them released sooner?\nBecause I was not sure that nothing more than poaching was against them.\nI wanted to study the ground. As the days went by, my conviction became\nmore and more certain. The day after the events of the inexplicable\ngallery I had need of help I could rely on, so I resolved to have them\nreleased at once.\"\n\nThat was how Joseph Rouletabille explained himself. Once more I could\nnot but be astonished at the simplicity of the reasoning which had\nbrought him to the truth of the matter. Certainly this was no big thing;\nbut I think, myself, that the young man will, one of these days, explain\nwith the same simplicity, the fearful tragedy in The Yellow Room as well\nas the phenomenon of the inexplicable gallery.\n\nWe reached the Donjon Inn and entered it.\n\nThis time we did not see the landlord, but were received with a pleasant\nsmile by the hostess. I have already described the room in which we\nfound ourselves, and I have given a glimpse of the charming blonde woman\nwith the gentle eyes who now immediately began to prepare our breakfast.\n\n\"How's Daddy Mathieu?\" asked Rouletabille.\n\n\"Not much better--not much better; he is still confined to his bed.\"\n\n\"His rheumatism still sticks to him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes. Last night I was again obliged to give him morphine--the only drug\nthat gives him any relief.\"\n\nShe spoke in a soft voice. Everything about her expressed gentleness.\nShe was, indeed, a beautiful woman; somewhat with an air of indolence,\nwith great eyes seemingly black and blue--amorous eyes. Was she happy\nwith her crabbed, rheumatic husband? The scene at which we had once been\npresent did not lead us to believe that she was; yet there was something\nin her bearing that was not suggestive of despair. She disappeared into\nthe kitchen to prepare our repast, leaving on the table a bottle of\nexcellent cider. Rouletabille filled our earthenware mugs, loaded his\npipe, and quietly explained to me his reason for asking me to come to\nthe Glandier with revolvers.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, contemplatively looking at the clouds of smoke he was\npuffing out, \"yes, my dear boy, I expect the assassin to-night.\" A brief\nsilence followed, which I took care not to interrupt, and then he went\non:\n\n\"Last night, just as I was going to bed, Monsieur Robert Darzac knocked\nat my room. When he came in he confided to me that he was compelled to\ngo to Paris the next day, that is, this morning. The reason which made\nthis journey necessary was at once peremptory and mysterious; it was not\npossible for him to explain its object to me. 'I go, and yet,' he added,\n'I would give my life not to leave Mademoiselle Stangerson at this\nmoment.' He did not try to hide that he believed her to be once more in\ndanger. 'It will not greatly astonish me if something happens to-morrow\nnight,' he avowed, 'and yet I must be absent. I cannot be back at the\nGlandier before the morning of the day after to-morrow.'\n\n\"I asked him to explain himself, and this is all he would tell me.\nHis anticipation of coming danger had come to him solely from the\ncoincidence that Mademoiselle Stangerson had been twice attacked, and\nboth times when he had been absent. On the night of the incident of the\ninexplicable gallery he had been obliged to be away from the Glandier.\nOn the night of the tragedy in The Yellow Room he had also not been able\nto be at the Glandier, though this was the first time he had declared\nhimself on the matter. Now a man so moved who would still go away must\nbe acting under compulsion--must be obeying a will stronger than\nhis own. That was how I reasoned, and I told him so. He replied\n'Perhaps.'--I asked him if Mademoiselle Stangerson was compelling him.\nHe protested that she was not. His determination to go to Paris had been\ntaken without any conference with Mademoiselle Stangerson.\n\n\"To cut the story short, he repeated that his belief in the possibility\nof a fresh attack was founded entirely on the extraordinary coincidence.\n'If anything happens to Mademoiselle Stangerson,' he said, 'it would be\nterrible for both of us. For her, because her life would be in danger;\nfor me because I could neither defend her from the attack nor tell of\nwhere I had been. I am perfectly aware of the suspicions cast on me.\nThe examining magistrate and Monsieur Larsan are both on the point of\nbelieving in my guilt. Larsan tracked me the last time I went to Paris,\nand I had all the trouble in the world to get rid of him.'\n\n\"'Why do you not tell me the name of the murderer now, if you know it?'\nI cried.\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac appeared extremely troubled by my question, and replied\nto me in a hesitating tone:\n\n\"'I?--I know the name of the murderer? Why, how could I know his name?'\n\n\"I at once replied: 'From Mademoiselle Stangerson.'\n\n\"He grew so pale that I thought he was about to faint, and I saw that I\nhad hit the nail right on the head. Mademoiselle and he knew the name of\nthe murderer! When he recovered himself, he said to me: 'I am going to\nleave you. Since you have been here I have appreciated your exceptional\nintelligence and your unequalled ingenuity. But I ask this service of\nyou. Perhaps I am wrong to fear an attack during the coming night; but,\nas I must act with foresight, I count on you to frustrate any attempt\nthat may be made. Take every step needful to protect Mademoiselle\nStangerson. Keep a most careful watch of her room. Don't go to sleep,\nnor allow yourself one moment of repose. The man we dread is remarkably\ncunning--with a cunning that has never been equalled. If you keep watch\nhis very cunning may save her; because it's impossible that he should\nnot know that you are watching; and knowing it, he may not venture.'\n\n\"'Have you spoken of all this to Monsieur Stangerson?'\n\n\"'No. I do not wish him to ask me, as you just now did, for the name of\nthe murderer. I tell you all this, Monsieur Rouletabille, because I have\ngreat, very great, confidence in you. I know that you do not suspect\nme.'\n\n\"The poor man spoke in jerks. He was evidently suffering. I pitied him,\nthe more because I felt sure that he would rather allow himself to\nbe killed than tell me who the murderer was. As for Mademoiselle\nStangerson, I felt that she would rather allow herself to be murdered\nthan denounce the man of The Yellow Room and of the inexplicable\ngallery. The man must be dominating her, or both, by some inscrutable\npower. They were dreading nothing so much as the chance of Monsieur\nStangerson knowing that his daughter was 'held' by her assailant. I made\nMonsieur Darzac understand that he had explained himself sufficiently,\nand that he might refrain from telling me any more than he had already\ntold me. I promised him to watch through the night. He insisted that I\nshould establish an absolutely impassable barrier around Mademoiselle\nStangerson's chamber, around the boudoir where the nurses were sleeping,\nand around the drawing-room where, since the affair of the inexplicable\ngallery, Monsieur Stangerson had slept. In short, I was to put a cordon\nround the whole apartment.\n\n\"From his insistence I gathered that Monsieur Darzac intended not only\nto make it impossible for the expected man to reach the chamber of\nMademoiselle Stangerson, but to make that impossibility so visibly clear\nthat, seeing himself expected, he would at once go away. That was how\nI interpreted his final words when we parted: 'You may mention your\nsuspicions of the expected attack to Monsieur Stangerson, to Daddy\nJacques, to Frederic Larsan, and to anybody in the chateau.'\n\n\"The poor fellow left me hardly knowing what he was saying. My silence\nand my eyes told him that I had guessed a large part of his secret. And,\nindeed, he must have been at his wits' end, to have come to me at such a\ntime, and to abandon Mademoiselle Stangerson in spite of his fixed idea\nas to the consequence.\n\n\"When he was gone, I began to think that I should have to use even a\ngreater cunning than his so that if the man should come that night,\nhe might not for a moment suspect that his coming had been expected.\nCertainly! I would allow him to get in far enough, so that, dead or\nalive, I might see his face clearly! He must be got rid of. Mademoiselle\nStangerson must be freed from this continual impending danger.\n\n\"Yes, my boy,\" said Rouletabille, after placing his pipe on the table,\nand emptying his mug of cider, \"I must see his face distinctly, so as to\nmake sure to impress it on that part of my brain where I have drawn my\ncircle of reasoning.\"\n\nThe landlady re-appeared at that moment, bringing in the traditional\nbacon omelette. Rouletabille chaffed her a little, and she took the\nchaff with the most charming good humour.\n\n\"She is much jollier when Daddy Mathieu is in bed with his rheumatism,\"\nRouletabille said to me.\n\nBut I had eyes neither for Rouletabille nor for the landlady's smiles.\nI was entirely absorbed over the last words of my young friend and in\nthinking over Monsieur Robert Darzac's strange behaviour.\n\nWhen he had finished his omelette and we were again alone, Rouletabille\ncontinued the tale of his confidences.\n\n\"When I sent you my telegram this morning,\" he said, \"I had only\nthe word of Monsieur Darzac, that 'perhaps' the assassin would come\nto-night. I can now say that he will certainly come. I expect him.\"\n\n\"What has made you feel this certainty?\"\n\n\"I have been sure since half-past ten o'clock this morning that he\nwould come. I knew that before we saw Arthur Rance at the window in the\ncourt.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, \"But, again--what made you so sure? And why since\nhalf-past ten this morning?\"\n\n\"Because, at half-past ten, I had proof that Mademoiselle Stangerson was\nmaking as many efforts to permit of the murderer's entrance as Monsieur\nRobert Darzac had taken precautions against it.\"\n\n\"Is that possible!\" I cried. \"Haven't you told me that Mademoiselle\nStangerson loves Monsieur Robert Darzac?\"\n\n\"I told you so because it is the truth.\"\n\n\"Then do you see nothing strange--\"\n\n\"Everything in this business is strange, my friend; but take my word for\nit, the strangeness you now feel is nothing to the strangeness that's to\ncome!\"\n\n\"It must be admitted, then,\" I said, \"that Mademoiselle Stangerson and\nher murderer are in communication--at any rate in writing?\"\n\n\"Admit it, my friend, admit it! You don't risk anything! I told you\nabout the letter left on her table, on the night of the inexplicable\ngallery affair,--the letter that disappeared into the pocket of\nMademoiselle Stangerson. Why should it not have been a summons to a\nmeeting? Might he not, as soon as he was sure of Darzac's absence,\nappoint the meeting for 'the coming night?\"\n\nAnd my friend laughed silently. There are moments when I ask myself if\nhe is not laughing at me.\n\nThe door of the inn opened. Rouletabille was on his feet so suddenly\nthat one might have thought he had received an electric shock.\n\n\"Mr. Arthur Rance!\" he cried.\n\nMr. Arthur Rance stood before us calmly bowing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. An Act of Mademoiselle Stangerson\n\n\n\"You remember me, Monsieur?\" asked Rouletabille.\n\n\"Perfectly!\" replied Arthur Rance. \"I recognise you as the lad at the\nbar. [The face of Rouletabille crimsoned at being called a \"lad.\"] I\nwant to shake hands with you. You are a bright little fellow.\"\n\nThe American extended his hand and Rouletabille, relaxing his frown,\nshook it and introduced Mr. Arthur Rance to me. He invited him to share\nour meal.\n\n\"No thanks. I breakfasted with Monsieur Stangerson.\"\n\nArthur Rance spoke French perfectly,--almost without an accent.\n\n\"I did not expect to have the pleasure of seeing you again, Monsieur. I\nthought you were to have left France the day after the reception at the\nElysee.\"\n\nRouletabille and I, outwardly indifferent, listened most intently for\nevery word the American would say.\n\nThe man's purplish red face, his heavy eyelids, the nervous twitchings,\nall spoke of his addiction to drink. How came it that so sorry a\nspecimen of a man should be so intimate with Monsieur Stangerson?\n\nSome days later, I learned from Frederic Larsan--who, like ourselves,\nwas surprised and mystified by his appearance and reception at the\nchateau--that Mr. Rance had been an inebriate for only about fifteen\nyears; that is to say, since the professor and his daughter left\nPhiladelphia. During the time the Stangersons lived in America they were\nvery intimate with Arthur Rance, who was one of the most distinguished\nphrenologists of the new world. Owing to new experiments, he had\nmade enormous strides beyond the science of Gall and Lavater. The\nfriendliness with which he was received at the Glandier may be explained\nby the fact that he had once rendered Mademoiselle Stangerson a great\nservice by stopping, at the peril of his own life, the runaway horses of\nher carriage. The immediate result of that could, however, have been no\nmore than a mere friendly association with the Stangersons; certainly,\nnot a love affair.\n\nFrederic Larsan did not tell me where he had picked up this information;\nbut he appeared to be quite sure of what he said.\n\nHad we known these facts at the time Arthur Rance met us at the Donjon\nInn, his presence at the chateau might not have puzzled us, but they\ncould not have failed to increase our interest in the man himself. The\nAmerican must have been at least forty-five years old. He spoke in a\nperfectly natural tone in reply to Rouletabille's question.\n\n\"I put off my return to America when I heard of the attack on\nMademoiselle Stangerson. I wanted to be certain the lady had not been\nkilled, and I shall not go away until she is perfectly recovered.\"\n\nArthur Rance then took the lead in talk, paying no heed to some of\nRouletabille's questions. He gave us, without our inviting him, his\npersonal views on the subject of the tragedy,--views which, as well as\nI could make out, were not far from those held by Frederic Larzan. The\nAmerican also thought that Robert Darzac had something to do with the\nmatter. He did not mention him by name, but there was no room to doubt\nwhom he meant. He told us he was aware of the efforts young Rouletabille\nwas making to unravel the tangled skein of The Yellow Room mystery. He\nexplained that Monsieur Stangerson had related to him all that had taken\nplace in the inexplicable gallery. He several times expressed his regret\nat Monsieur Darzac's absence from the chateau on all these occasions,\nand thought that Monsieur Darzac had done cleverly in allying himself\nwith Monsieur Joseph Rouletabille, who could not fail, sooner or later,\nto discover the murderer. He spoke the last sentence with unconcealed\nirony. Then he rose, bowed to us, and left the inn.\n\nRouletabille watched him through the window.\n\n\"An odd fish, that!\" he said.\n\n\"Do you think he'll pass the night at the Glandier?\" I asked.\n\nTo my amazement the young reporter answered that it was a matter of\nentire indifference to him whether he did or not.\n\nAs to how we spent our time during the afternoon, all I need say is\nthat Rouletabille led me to the grotto of Sainte-Genevieve, and, all\nthe time, talked of every subject but the one in which we were most\ninterested. Towards evening I was surprised to find Rouletabille making\nnone of the preparations I had expected him to make. I spoke to him\nabout it when night had come on, and we were once more in his room. He\nreplied that all his arrangements had already been made, and this time\nthe murderer would not get away from him.\n\nI expressed some doubt on this, reminding him of his disappearance in\nthe gallery, and suggested that the same phenomenon might occur again.\nHe answered that he hoped it would. He desired nothing more. I did not\ninsist, knowing by experience how useless that would have been. He told\nme that, with the help of the concierges, the chateau had since early\ndawn been watched in such a way that nobody could approach it without\nhis knowing it, and that he had no concern for those who might have left\nit and remained without.\n\nIt was then six o'clock by his watch. Rising, he made a sign to me to\nfollow him, and, without in the least trying to conceal his movements or\nthe sound of his footsteps, he led me through the gallery. We reached\nthe 'right' gallery and came to the landing-place which we crossed.\nWe then continued our way in the gallery of the left wing, passing\nProfessor Stangerson's apartment.\n\nAt the far end of the gallery, before coming to the donjon, is the room\noccupied by Arthur Rance. We knew that, because we had seen him at the\nwindow looking on to the court. The door of the room opens on to the end\nof the gallery, exactly facing the east window, at the extremity of\nthe 'right' gallery, where Rouletabille had placed Daddy Jacques, and\ncommands an uninterrupted view of the gallery from end to end of the\nchateau.\n\n\"That 'off-turning' gallery,\" said Rouletabille, \"I reserve for myself;\nwhen I tell you you'll come and take your place here.\"\n\nAnd he made me enter a little dark, triangular closet built in a bend\nof the wall, to the left of the door of Arthur Rance's room. From this\nrecess I could see all that occurred in the gallery as well as if I had\nbeen standing in front of Arthur Rance's door, and I could watch\nthat door, too. The door of the closet, which was to be my place\nof observation, was fitted with panels of transparent glass. In the\ngallery, where all the lamps had been lit, it was quite light. In the\ncloset, however, it was quite dark. It was a splendid place from which\nto observe and remain unobserved.\n\nI was soon to play the part of a spy--a common policeman. I wonder what\nmy leader at the bar would have said had he known! I was not altogether\npleased with my duties, but I could not refuse Rouletabille the\nassistance he had begged me to give him. I took care not to make him\nsee that I in the least objected, and for several reasons. I wanted to\noblige him; I did not wish him to think me a coward; I was filled\nwith curiosity; and it was too late for me to draw back, even had\nI determined to do so. That I had not had these scruples sooner was\nbecause my curiosity had quite got the better of me. I might also urge\nthat I was helping to save the life of a woman, and even a lawyer may do\nthat conscientiously.\n\nWe returned along the gallery. On reaching the door of Mademoiselle\nStangerson's apartment, it opened from a push given by the steward who\nwas waiting at the dinner-table. (Monsieur Stangerson had, for the last\nthree days, dined with his daughter in the drawing-room on the first\nfloor.) As the door remained open, we distinctly saw Mademoiselle\nStangerson, taking advantage of the steward's absence, and while her\nfather was stooping to pick up something he had let fall, pour the\ncontents of a phial into Monsieur Stangerson's glass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. On the Watch\n\n\nThe act, which staggered me, did not appear to affect Rouletabille much.\nWe returned to his room and, without even referring to what we had seen,\nhe gave me his final instructions for the night. First we were to go to\ndinner; after dinner, I was to take my stand in the dark closet and wait\nthere as long as it was necessary--to look out for what might happen.\n\n\"If you see anything before I do,\" he explained, \"you must let me know.\nIf the man gets into the 'right' gallery by any other way than the\n'off-turning' gallery, you will see him before I shall, because you have\na view along the whole length of the 'right' gallery, while I can only\ncommand a view of the 'off-turning' gallery. All you need do to let\nme know is to undo the cord holding the curtain of the 'right' gallery\nwindow, nearest to the dark closet. The curtain will fall of itself and\nimmediately leave a square of shadow where previously there had been a\nsquare of light. To do this, you need but stretch your hand out of the\ncloset, I shall understand your signal perfectly.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you will see me coming round the corner of the 'off-turning'\ngallery.\"\n\n\"What am I to do then?\"\n\n\"You will immediately come towards me, behind the man; but I shall\nalready be upon him, and shall have seen his face.\"\n\nI attempted a feeble smile.\n\n\"Why do you smile? Well, you may smile while you have the chance, but I\nswear you'll have no time for that a few hours from now.\n\n\"And if the man escapes?\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" said Rouletabille, coolly, \"I don't want to\ncapture him. He may take himself off any way he can. I will let\nhim go--after I have seen his face. That's all I want. I shall know\nafterwards what to do so that as far as Mademoiselle Stangerson is\nconcerned he shall be dead to her even though he continues to live. If\nI took him alive, Mademoiselle Stangerson and Robert Darzac would,\nperhaps, never forgive me! And I wish to retain their good-will and\nrespect.\n\n\"Seeing, as I have just now seen, Mademoiselle Stangerson pour a\nnarcotic into her father's glass, so that he might not be awake to\ninterrupt the conversation she is going to have with her murderer, you\ncan imagine she would not be grateful to me if I brought the man of\nThe Yellow Room and the inexplicable gallery, bound and gagged, to her\nfather. I realise now that if I am to save the unhappy lady, I must\nsilence the man and not capture him. To kill a human being is no small\nthing. Besides, that's not my business, unless the man himself makes it\nmy business. On the other hand, to render him forever silent without\nthe lady's assent and confidence is to act on one's own initiative and\nassumes a knowledge of everything with nothing for a basis. Fortunately,\nmy friend, I have guessed, no, I have reasoned it all out. All that I\nask of the man who is coming to-night is to bring me his face, so that\nit may enter--\"\n\n\"Into the circle?\"\n\n\"Exactly! And his face won't surprise me!\"\n\n\"But I thought you saw his face on the night when you sprang into the\nchamber?\"\n\n\"Only imperfectly. The candle was on the floor; and, his beard--\"\n\n\"Will he wear his beard this evening?\"\n\n\"I think I can say for certain that he will. But the gallery is light\nand, now, I know--or--at least, my brain knows--and my eyes will see.\"\n\n\"If we are here only to see him and let him escape, why are we armed?\"\n\n\"Because, if the man of The Yellow Room and the inexplicable gallery\nknows that I know, he is capable of doing anything! We should then have\nto defend ourselves.\"\n\n\"And you are sure he will come to-night?\"\n\n\"As sure as that you are standing there! This morning, at half-past ten\no'clock, Mademoiselle Stangerson, in the cleverest way in the world,\narranged to have no nurses to-night. She gave them leave of absence for\ntwenty-four hours, under some plausible pretexts, and did not desire\nanybody to be with her but her father, while they are away. Her father,\nwho is to sleep in the boudoir, has gladly consented to the arrangement.\nDarzac's departure and what he told me, as well as the extraordinary\nprecautions Mademoiselle Stangerson is taking to be alone to-night\nleaves me no room for doubt. She has prepared the way for the coming of\nthe man whom Darzac dreads.\"\n\n\"That's awful!\"\n\n\"It is!\"\n\n\"And what we saw her do was done to send her father to sleep?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then there are but two of us for to-night's work?\"\n\n\"Four; the concierge and his wife will watch at all hazards. I don't\nset much value on them before--but the concierge may be useful after--if\nthere's to be any killing!\"\n\n\"Then you think there may be?\"\n\n\"If he wishes it.\"\n\n\"Why haven't you brought in Daddy Jacques?--Have you made no use of him\nto-day?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Rouletabille sharply.\n\nI kept silence for awhile, then, anxious to know his thoughts, I asked\nhim point blank:\n\n\"Why not tell Arthur Rance?--He may be of great assistance to us?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Rouletabille crossly, \"then you want to let everybody into\nMademoiselle Stangerson's secrets?--Come, let us go to dinner; it is\ntime. This evening we dine in Frederic Larsan's room,--at least, if\nhe is not on the heels of Darzac. He sticks to him like a leech. But,\nanyhow, if he is not there now, I am quite sure he will be, to-night!\nHe's the one I am going to knock over!\"\n\nAt this moment we heard a noise in the room near us.\n\n\"It must be he,\" said Rouletabille.\n\n\"I forgot to ask you,\" I said, \"if we are to make any allusion to\nto-night's business when we are with this policeman. I take it we are\nnot. Is that so?\"\n\n\"Evidently. We are going to operate alone, on our own personal account.\"\n\n\"So that all the glory will be ours?\"\n\nRouletabille laughed.\n\nWe dined with Frederic Larsan in his room. He told us he had just come\nin and invited us to be seated at table. We ate our dinner in the best\nof humours, and I had no difficulty in appreciating the feelings of\ncertainty which both Rouletabille and Larsan felt. Rouletabille told the\ngreat Fred that I had come on a chance visit, and that he had asked me\nto stay and help him in the heavy batch of writing he had to get through\nfor the \"Epoque.\" I was going back to Paris, he said, by the eleven\no'clock train, taking his \"copy,\" which took a story form, recounting\nthe principal episodes in the mysteries of the Glandier. Larsan smiled\nat the explanation like a man who was not fooled and politely refrains\nfrom making the slightest remark on matters which did not concern him.\n\nWith infinite precautions as to the words they used, and even as to the\ntones of their voices, Larsan and Rouletabille discussed, for a long\ntime, Mr. Arthur Rance's appearance at the chateau, and his past in\nAmerica, about which they expressed a desire to know more, at any rate,\nso far as his relations with the Stangersons. At one time, Larsan, who\nappeared to me to be unwell, said, with an effort:\n\n\"I think, Monsieur Rouletabille, that we've not much more to do at the\nGlandier, and that we sha'n't sleep here many more nights.\"\n\n\"I think so, too, Monsieur Fred.\"\n\n\"Then you think the conclusion of the matter has been reached?\"\n\n\"I think, indeed, that we have nothing more to find out,\" replied\nRouletabille.\n\n\"Have you found your criminal?\" asked Larsan.\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" said Rouletabille.\n\n\"Can it be the same man?\"\n\n\"I don't know if you have swerved from your original idea,\" said the\nyoung reporter. Then he added, with emphasis: \"Monsieur Darzac is an\nhonest man!\"\n\n\"Are you sure of that?\" asked Larsan. \"Well, I am sure he is not. So\nit's a fight then?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a fight. But I shall beat you, Monsieur Frederic Larsan.\"\n\n\"Youth never doubts anything,\" said the great Fred laughingly, and held\nout his hand to me by way of conclusion.\n\nRouletabille's answer came like an echo:\n\n\"Not anything!\"\n\nSuddenly Larsan, who had risen to wish us goodnight, pressed both his\nhands to his chest and staggered. He was obliged to lean on Rouletabille\nfor support, and to save himself from falling.\n\n\"Oh! Oh!\" he cried. \"What is the matter with me?--Have I been poisoned?\"\n\nHe looked at us with haggard eyes. We questioned him vainly; he did not\nanswer us. He had sunk into an armchair and we could get not a word from\nhim. We were extremely distressed, both on his account and on our own,\nfor we had partaken of all the dishes he had eaten. He seemed to be out\nof pain; but his heavy head had fallen on his shoulder and his eyelids\nwere tightly closed. Rouletabille bent over him, listening for the\nbeatings of the heart.\n\nMy friend's face, however, when he stood up, was as calm as it had been\na moment before agitated.\n\n\"He is asleep,\" he said.\n\nHe led me to his chamber, after closing Larsan's room.\n\n\"The drug?\" I asked. \"Does Mademoiselle Stangerson wish to put everybody\nto sleep, to-night?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Rouletabille; but I could see he was thinking of\nsomething else.\n\n\"But what about us?\" I exclaimed. \"How do we know that we have not been\ndrugged?\"\n\n\"Do you feel indisposed?\" Rouletabille asked me coolly.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Do you feel any inclination to go to sleep?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"Well, then, my friend, smoke this excellent cigar.\"\n\nAnd he handed me a choice Havana, one Monsieur Darzac had given him,\nwhile he lit his briarwood--his eternal briarwood.\n\nWe remained in his room until about ten o'clock without a word passing\nbetween us. Buried in an armchair Rouletabille sat and smoked steadily,\nhis brow in thought and a far-away look in his eyes. On the stroke of\nten he took off his boots and signalled to me to do the same. As we\nstood in our socks he said, in so low a tone that I guessed, rather than\nheard, the word:\n\n\"Revolver.\"\n\nI drew my revolver from my jacket pocket.\n\n\"Cock it!\" he said.\n\nI did as he directed.\n\nThen moving towards the door of his room, he opened it with infinite\nprecaution; it made no sound. We were in the \"off-turning\" gallery.\nRouletabille made another sign to me which I understood to mean that I\nwas to take up my post in the dark closet.\n\nWhen I was some distance from him, he rejoined me and embraced me; and\nthen I saw him, with the same precaution, return to his room. Astonished\nby his embrace, and somewhat disquieted by it, I arrived at the right\ngallery without difficulty, crossing the landing-place, and reaching the\ndark closet.\n\nBefore entering it I examined the curtain-cord of the window and found\nthat I had only to release it from its fastening with my fingers for\nthe curtain to fall by its own weight and hide the square of light from\nRouletabille--the signal agreed upon. The sound of a footstep made me\nhalt before Arthur Rance's door. He was not yet in bed, then! How was\nit that, being in the chateau, he had not dined with Monsieur Stangerson\nand his daughter? I had not seen him at table with them, at the moment\nwhen we looked in.\n\nI retired into the dark closet. I found myself perfectly situated. I\ncould see along the whole length of the gallery. Nothing, absolutely\nnothing could pass there without my seeing it. But what was going to\npass there? Rouletabille's embrace came back to my mind. I argued that\npeople don't part from each, other in that way unless on an important or\ndangerous occasion. Was I then in danger?\n\nMy hand closed on the butt of my revolver and I waited. I am not a hero;\nbut neither am I a coward.\n\nI waited about an hour, and during all that time I saw nothing unusual.\nThe rain, which had begun to come down strongly towards nine o'clock,\nhad now ceased.\n\nMy friend had told me that, probably, nothing would occur before\nmidnight or one o'clock in the morning. It was not more than half-past\neleven, however, when I heard the door of Arthur Rance's room open very\nslowly. The door remained open for a minute, which seemed to me a long\ntime. As it opened into the gallery, that is to say, outwards, I could\nnot see what was passing in the room behind the door.\n\nAt that moment I noticed a strange sound, three times repeated, coming\nfrom the park. Ordinarily I should not have attached any more importance\nto it than I would to the noise of cats on the roof. But the third time,\nthe mew was so sharp and penetrating that I remembered what I had heard\nabout the cry of the Bete du bon Dieu. As the cry had accompanied all\nthe events at the Glandier, I could not refrain from shuddering at the\nthought.\n\nDirectly afterwards I saw a man appear on the outside of the door, and\nclose it after him. At first I could not recognise him, for his back was\ntowards me and he was bending over a rather bulky package. When he had\nclosed the door and picked up the package, he turned towards the dark\ncloset, and then I saw who he was. He was the forest-keeper, the Green\nMan. He was wearing the same costume that he had worn when I first saw\nhim on the road in front of the Donjon Inn. There was no doubt about his\nbeing the keeper. As the cry of the Bete du Bon Dieu came for the third\ntime, he put down the package and went to the second window, counting\nfrom the dark closet. I dared not risk making any movement, fearing I\nmight betray my presence.\n\nArriving at the window, he peered out on to the park. The night was\nnow light, the moon showing at intervals. The Green Man raised his\narms twice, making signs which I did not understand; then, leaving the\nwindow, he again took up his package and moved along the gallery towards\nthe landing-place.\n\nRouletabille had instructed me to undo the curtain-cord when I saw\nanything. Was Rouletabille expecting this? It was not my business\nto question. All I had to do was obey instructions. I unfastened the\nwindow-cord; my heart beating the while as if it would burst. The man\nreached the landing-place, but, to my utter surprise--I had expected to\nsee him continue to pass along the gallery--I saw him descend the stairs\nleading to the vestibule.\n\nWhat was I to do? I looked stupidly at the heavy curtain which had shut\nthe light from the window. The signal had been given, and I did not see\nRouletabille appear at the corner of the off-turning gallery. Nobody\nappeared. I was exceedingly perplexed. Half an hour passed, an age to\nme. What was I to do now, even if I saw something? The signal once given\nI could not give it a second time. To venture into the gallery might\nupset all Rouletabille's plans. After all, I had nothing to reproach\nmyself for, and if something had happened that my friend had not\nexpected he could only blame himself. Unable to be of any further\nassistance to him by means of a signal, I left the dark closet and,\nstill in my socks, made my way to the \"off-turning\" gallery.\n\nThere was no one there. I went to the door of Rouletabille's room and\nlistened. I could hear nothing. I knocked gently. There was no answer. I\nturned the door-handle and the door opened. I entered. Rouletabille lay\nextended at full length on the floor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. The Incredible Body\n\n\nI bent in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had the joy\nto find that he was deeply sleeping, the same unhealthy sleep that I had\nseen fall upon Frederic Larsan. He had succumbed to the influence of the\nsame drug that had been mixed with our food. How was it then, that I,\nalso, had not been overcome by it? I reflected that the drug must have\nbeen put into our wine; because that would explain my condition. I never\ndrink when eating. Naturally inclined to obesity, I am restricted to\na dry diet. I shook Rouletabille, but could not succeed in waking him.\nThis, no doubt, was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson.\n\nShe had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself against this\nyoung man as well as her father. I recalled that the steward, in serving\nus, had recommended an excellent Chablis which, no doubt, had come from\nthe professor's table.\n\nMore-than a quarter of an hour passed. I resolved, under the pressing\ncircumstances, to resort to extreme measures. I threw a pitcher of cold\nwater over Rouletabille's head. He opened his eyes. I beat his face, and\nraised him up. I felt him stiffen in my arms and heard him murmur: \"Go\non, go on; but don't make any noise.\" I pinched him and shook him until\nhe was able to stand up. We were saved!\n\n\"They sent me to sleep,\" he said. \"Ah! I passed an awful quarter of an\nhour before giving way. But it is over now. Don't leave me.\"\n\nHe had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by a\nfrightful cry that rang through the chateau,--a veritable death cry.\n\n\"Malheur!\" roared Rouletabille; \"we shall be too late!\"\n\nHe tried to rush to the door, but he was too dazed, and fell against\nthe wall. I was already in the gallery, revolver in hand, rushing like\na madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson's room. The moment I arrived at\nthe intersection of the \"off-turning\" gallery and the \"right\" gallery, I\nsaw a figure leaving her apartment, which, in a few strides had reached\nthe landing-place.\n\nI was not master of myself. I fired. The report from the revolver made a\ndeafening noise; but the man continued his flight down the stairs. I\nran behind him, shouting: \"Stop!--stop! or I will kill you!\" As I rushed\nafter him down the stairs, I came face to face with Arthur Rance coming\nfrom the left wing of the chateau, yelling: \"What is it? What is it?\" We\narrived almost at the same time at the foot of the staircase. The window\nof the vestibule was open. We distinctly saw the form of a man running\naway. Instinctively we fired our revolvers in his direction. He was not\nmore than ten paces in front of us; he staggered and we thought he was\ngoing to fall. We had sprung out of the window, but the man dashed off\nwith renewed vigour. I was in my socks, and the American was barefooted.\nThere being no hope of overtaking him, we fired our last cartridges at\nhim. But he still kept on running, going along the right side of the\ncourt towards the end of the right wing of the chateau, which had\nno other outlet than the door of the little chamber occupied by the\nforest-keeper. The man, though he was evidently wounded by our bullets,\nwas now twenty yards ahead of us. Suddenly, behind us, and above\nour heads, a window in the gallery opened and we heard the voice of\nRouletabille crying out desperately:\n\n\"Fire, Bernier!--Fire!\"\n\nAt that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a broad\nflash. By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on the threshold\nof the donjon door.\n\nHe had taken good aim. The shadow fell. But as it had reached the end of\nthe right wing of the chateau, it fell on the other side of the angle\nof the building; that is to say, we saw it about to fall, but not the\nactual sinking to the ground. Bernier, Arthur Rance and myself reached\nthe other side twenty seconds later. The shadow was lying dead at our\nfeet.\n\nAroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports, Larsan opened the\nwindow of his chamber and called out to us. Rouletabille, quite awake\nnow, joined us at the same moment, and I cried out to him:\n\n\"He is dead!--is dead!\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" he said. \"Take him into the vestibule of the\nchateau.\" Then as if on second thought, he said: \"No!--no! Let us put\nhim in his own room.\"\n\nRouletabille knocked at the door. Nobody answered. Naturally, this did\nnot surprise me.\n\n\"He is evidently not there, otherwise he would have come out,\" said the\nreporter. \"Let us carry him to the vestibule then.\"\n\nSince reaching the dead shadow, a thick cloud had covered the moon and\ndarkened the night, so that we were unable to make out the features.\nDaddy Jacques, who had now joined us, helped us to carry the body into\nthe vestibule, where we laid it down on the lower step of the stairs.\nOn the way, I had felt my hands wet from the warm blood flowing from the\nwounds.\n\nDaddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern. He held\nit close to the face of the dead shadow, and we recognised the keeper,\nthe man called by the landlord of the Donjon Inn the Green Man, whom, an\nhour earlier, I had seen come out of Arthur Rance's chamber carrying a\nparcel. But what I had seen I could only tell Rouletabille later, when\nwe were alone.\n\nRouletabille and Frederic Larsan experienced a cruel disappointment\nat the result of the night's adventure. They could only look in\nconsternation and stupefaction at the body of the Green Man.\n\nDaddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly\nlamentations kept repeating that we were mistaken--the keeper could not\nbe the assailant. We were obliged to compel him to be quiet. He could\nnot have shown greater grief had the body been that of his own son.\nI noticed, while all the rest of us were more or less undressed and\nbarefooted, that he was fully clothed.\n\nRouletabille had not left the body. Kneeling on the flagstones by the\nlight of Daddy Jacques's lantern he removed the clothes from the body\nand laid bare its breast. Then snatching the lantern from Daddy Jacques,\nhe held it over the corpse and saw a gaping wound. Rising suddenly he\nexclaimed in a voice filled with savage irony:\n\n\"The man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab of a knife\nin his heart!\"\n\nI thought Rouletabille had gone mad; but, bending over the body, I\nquickly satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right. Not a sign of\na bullet anywhere--the wound, evidently made by a sharp blade, had\npenetrated the heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. The Double Scent\n\n\nI had hardly recovered from the surprise into which this new discovery\nhad plunged me, when Rouletabille touched me on the shoulder and asked\nme to follow him into his room.\n\n\"What are we going to do there?\"\n\n\"To think the matter over.\"\n\nI confess I was in no condition for doing much thinking, nor could\nI understand how Rouletabille could so control himself as to be\nable calmly to sit down for reflection when he must have known that\nMademoiselle Stangerson was at that moment almost on the point of death.\nBut his self-control was more than I could explain. Closing the door of\nhis room, he motioned me to a chair and, seating himself before me,\ntook out his pipe. We sat there for some time in silence and then I fell\nasleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was daylight. It was eight o'clock by my watch.\nRouletabille was no longer in the room. I rose to go out when the door\nopened and my friend re-entered. He had evidently lost no time.\n\n\"How about Mademoiselle Stangerson?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Her condition, though very alarming, is not desperate.\"\n\n\"When did you leave this room?\"\n\n\"Towards dawn.\"\n\n\"I guess you have been hard at work?\"\n\n\"Rather!\"\n\n\"Have you found out anything?\"\n\n\"Two sets of footprints!\"\n\n\"Do they explain anything?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have they anything to do with the mystery of the keeper's body?\"\n\n\"Yes; the mystery is no longer a mystery. This morning, walking round\nthe chateau, I found two distinct sets of footprints, made at the same\ntime, last night. They were made by two persons walking side by side.\nI followed them from the court towards the oak grove. Larsan joined me.\nThey were the same kind of footprints as were made at the time of the\nassault in The Yellow Room--one set was from clumsy boots and the other\nwas made by neat ones, except that the big toe of one of the sets was\nof a different size from the one measured in The Yellow Room incident. I\ncompared the marks with the paper patterns I had previously made.\n\n\"Still following the tracks of the prints, Larsan and I passed out of\nthe oak grove and reached the border of the lake. There they turned off\nto a little path leading to the high road to Epinay where we lost the\ntraces in the newly macadamised highway.\n\n\"We went back to the chateau and parted at the courtyard. We met\nagain, however, in Daddy Jacques's room to which our separate trains of\nthinking had led us both. We found the old servant in bed. His clothes\non the chair were wet through and his boots very muddy. He certainly did\nnot get into that state in helping us to carry the body of the keeper.\nIt was not raining then. Then his face showed extreme fatigue and he\nlooked at us out of terror-stricken eyes.\n\n\"On our first questioning him he told us that he had gone to bed\nimmediately after the doctor had arrived. On pressing him, however, for\nit was evident to us he was not speaking the truth, he confessed that he\nhad been away from the chateau. He explained his absence by saying\nthat he had a headache and went out into the fresh air, but had gone\nno further than the oak grove. When we then described to him the whole\nroute he had followed, he sat up in bed trembling.\n\n\"'And you were not alone!' cried Larsan.\n\n\"'Did you see it then?' gasped Daddy Jacques.\n\n\"'What?' I asked.\n\n\"'The phantom--the black phantom!'\n\n\"Then he told us that for several nights he had seen what he kept\ncalling the black phantom. It came into the park at the stroke of\nmidnight and glided stealthily through the trees; it appeared to him\nto pass through the trunks of the trees. Twice he had seen it from his\nwindow, by the light of the moon and had risen and followed the strange\napparition. The night before last he had almost overtaken it; but it had\nvanished at the corner of the donjon. Last night, however, he had not\nleft the chateau, his mind being disturbed by a presentiment that some\nnew crime would be attempted. Suddenly he saw the black phantom rush out\nfrom somewhere in the middle of the court. He followed it to the lake\nand to the high road to Epinay, where the phantom suddenly disappeared.\n\n\"'Did you see his face?' demanded Larsan.\n\n\"'No!--I saw nothing but black veils.'\n\n\"'Did you go out after what passed on the gallery?'\n\n\"'I could not!--I was terrified.'\n\n\"'Daddy Jacques,' I said, in a threatening voice, 'you did not follow\nit; you and the phantom walked to Epinay together--arm in arm!'\n\n\"'No!' he cried, turning his eyes away, 'I did not. It came on to pour,\nand--I turned back. I don't know what became of the black phantom.\"\n\n\"We left him, and when we were outside I turned to Larsan, looking\nhim full in the face, and put my question suddenly to take him off his\nguard:\n\n\"'An accomplice?'\n\n\"'How can I tell?' he replied, shrugging his shoulders. 'You can't be\nsure of anything in a case like this. Twenty-four hours ago I would have\nsworn that there was no accomplice!' He left me saying he was off to\nEpinay.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you make of it?\" I asked Rouletabille, after he had ended\nhis recital. \"Personally I am utterly in the dark. I can't make anything\nout of it. What do you gather?\"\n\n\"Everything! Everything!\" he exclaimed. \"But,\" he said abruptly, \"let's\nfind out more about Mademoiselle Stangerson.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. Rouletabille Knows the Two Halves of the Murderer\n\n\nMademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second time.\nUnfortunately, she was in too weak a state to bear the severer injuries\nof this second attack as well as she had those of the first. She had\nreceived three wounds in the breast from the murderer's knife, and she\nlay long between life and death. Her strong physique, however, saved\nher; but though she recovered physically it was found that her mind had\nbeen affected. The slightest allusion to the terrible incident sent her\ninto delirium, and the arrest of Robert Darzac which followed on the\nday following the tragic death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine\nintelligence into complete melancholia.\n\nRobert Darzac arrived at the chateau towards half-past nine. I saw him\nhurrying through the park, his hair and clothes in disorder and his face\na deadly white. Rouletabille and I were looking out of a window in the\ngallery. He saw us, and gave a despairing cry: \"I'm too late!\"\n\nRouletabille answered: \"She lives!\"\n\nA minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson's room and,\nthrough the door, we could hear his heart-rending sobs.\n\n\"There's a fate about this place!\" groaned Rouletabille. \"Some infernal\ngods must be watching over the misfortunes of this family!--If I had not\nbeen drugged, I should have saved Mademoiselle Stangerson. I should have\nsilenced him forever. And the keeper would not have been killed!\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac came in to speak with us. His distress was terrible.\nRouletabille told him everything: his preparations for Mademoiselle\nStangerson's safety; his plans for either capturing or for disposing of\nthe assailant for ever; and how he would have succeeded had it not been\nfor the drugging.\n\n\"If only you had trusted me!\" said the young man, in a low tone. \"If\nyou had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide in me!--But, then,\neverybody here distrusts everybody else, the daughter distrusts her\nfather, and even her lover. While you ask me to protect her she is doing\nall she can to frustrate me. That was why I came on the scene too late!\"\n\nAt Monsieur Robert Darzac's request Rouletabille described the whole\nscene. Leaning on the wall, to prevent himself from falling, he had made\nhis way to Mademoiselle Stangerson's room, while we were running after\nthe supposed murderer. The ante-room door was open and when he entered\nhe found Mademoiselle Stangerson lying partly thrown over the desk.\nHer dressing-gown was dyed with the blood flowing from her bosom. Still\nunder the influence of the drug, he felt he was walking in a horrible\nnightmare.\n\nHe went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window, shouted his\norder to fire, and then returned to the room. He crossed the deserted\nboudoir, entered the drawing-room, and tried to rouse Monsieur\nStangerson who was lying on a sofa. Monsieur Stangerson rose stupidly\nand let himself be drawn by Rouletabille into the room where, on seeing\nhis daughter's body, he uttered a heart-rending cry. Both united their\nfeeble strength and carried her to her bed.\n\nOn his way to join us Rouletabille passed by the desk. On the floor,\nnear it, he saw a large packet. He knelt down and, finding the wrapper\nloose, he examined it, and made out an enormous quantity of papers\nand photographs. On one of the papers he read: \"New differential\nelectroscopic condenser. Fundamental properties of substance\nintermediary between ponderable matter and imponderable ether.\" Strange\nirony of fate that the professor's precious papers should be restored\nto him at the very time when an attempt was being made to deprive him of\nhis daughter's life! What are papers worth to him now?\n\nThe morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet once more\nat the chateau, with his Registrar and gendarmes. Of course we were all\nquestioned. Rouletabille and I had already agreed on what to say. I kept\nback any information as to my being in the dark closet and said\nnothing about the drugging. We did not wish to suggest in any way that\nMademoiselle Stangerson had been expecting her nocturnal visitor.\nThe poor woman might, perhaps, never recover, and it was none of our\nbusiness to lift the veil of a secret the preservation of which she had\npaid for so dearly.\n\nArthur Rance told everybody, in a manner so natural that it astonished\nme, that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven o'clock of that\nfatal night. He had come for his valise, he said, which he was to take\nfor him early next morning to the Saint-Michel station, and had been\nkept out late running after poachers. Arthur Rance had, indeed, intended\nto leave the chateau and, according to his habit, to walk to the\nstation.\n\nMonsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said, adding that he had\nnot asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had taken his final\nleave of them both earlier in the evening. Monsieur Rance had had\ntea served him in his room, because he had complained of a slight\nindisposition.\n\nBernier testified, instructed by Rouletabille, that the keeper had\nordered him to meet at a spot near the oak grove, for the purpose of\nlooking out for poachers. Finding that the keeper did not keep his\nappointment, he, Bernier, had gone in search of him. He had almost\narrived at the donjon, when he saw a figure running swiftly in a\ndirection opposite to him, towards the right wing of the chateau. He\nheard revolver shots from behind the figure and saw Rouletabille at one\nof the gallery windows. He heard Rouletabille call out to him to fire,\nand he had fired. He believed he had killed the man until he learned,\nafter Rouletabille had uncovered the body, that the man had died from a\nknife thrust. Who had given it he could not imagine. \"Nobody could have\nbeen near the spot without my seeing him.\" When the examining magistrate\nreminded him that the spot where the body was found was very dark and\nthat he himself had not been able to recognise the keeper before firing,\nDaddy Bernier replied that neither had they seen the other body; nor had\nthey found it. In the narrow court where five people were standing it\nwould have been strange if the other body, had it been there, could\nhave escaped. The only door that opened into the court was that of the\nkeeper's room, and that door was closed, and the key of it was found in\nthe keeper's pocket.\n\nHowever that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue his\ninquiry further in this direction. He was evidently convinced that we\nhad missed the man we were chasing and we had come upon the keeper's\nbody in our chase. This matter of the keeper was another matter\nentirely. He wanted to satisfy himself about that without any further\ndelay. Probably it fitted in with the conclusions he had already arrived\nat as to the keeper and his intrigues with the wife of Mathieu, the\nlandlord of the Donjon Inn. This Mathieu, later in the afternoon, was\narrested and taken to Corbeil in spite of his rheumatism. He had been\nheard to threaten the keeper, and though no evidence against him had\nbeen found at his inn, the evidence of carters who had heard the threats\nwas enough to justify his retention.\n\nThe examination had proceeded thus far when, to our surprise, Frederic\nLarsan returned to the chateau. He was accompanied by one of the\nemployeeees of the railway. At that moment Rance and I were in the\nvestibule discussing Mathieu's guilt or innocence, while Rouletabille\nstood apart buried, apparently, in thought. The examining magistrate and\nhis Registrar were in the little green drawing-room, while Darzac was\nwith the doctor and Stangerson in the lady's chamber. As Frederic Larsan\nentered the vestibule with the railway employeee, Rouletabille and I at\nonce recognised him by the small blond beard. We exchanged meaningful\nglances. Larsan had himself announced to the examining magistrate by the\ngendarme and entered with the railway servant as Daddy Jacques came out.\nSome ten minutes went by during which Rouletabille appeared extremely\nimpatient. The door of the drawing-room was then opened and we heard the\nmagistrate calling to the gendarme who entered. Presently he came out,\nmounted the stairs and, coming back shortly, went in to the magistrate\nand said:\n\n\"Monsieur,--Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come!\"\n\n\"What! Not come!\" cried Monsieur de Marquet.\n\n\"He says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her present state.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Monsieur de Marquet; \"then we'll go to him.\"\n\nMonsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs. He made a sign\nto Larsan and the railroad employeee to follow. Rouletabille and I went\nalong too.\n\nOn reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber, Monsieur de\nMarquet knocked. A chambermaid appeared. It was Sylvia, with her hair\nall in disorder and consternation showing on her face.\n\n\"Is Monsieur Stangerson within?\" asked the magistrate.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Tell him that I wish to speak with him.\"\n\nStangerson came out. His appearance was wretched in the extreme.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he demanded of the magistrate. \"May I not be left in\npeace, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the magistrate, \"it is absolutely necessary that I\nshould see Monsieur Darzac at once. If you cannot induce him to come, I\nshall be compelled to use the help of the law.\"\n\nThe professor made no reply. He looked at us all like a man being led to\nexecution, and then went back into the room.\n\nAlmost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out. He was very\npale. He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the railway servant, his\nfeatures stiffened and he could hardly repress a groan.\n\nWe were all much moved by the appearance of the man. We felt that what\nwas about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur Robert Darzac.\nFrederic Larsan's face alone was radiant, showing a joy as of a dog that\nhad at last got its prey.\n\nPointing to the railway servant, Monsieur de Marquet said to Monsieur\nDarzac:\n\n\"Do you recognise this man, Monsieur?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried to make\nfirm. \"He is an employeee at the station at Epinay-sur-Orge.\"\n\n\"This young man,\" went on Monsieur de Marquet, \"affirms that he saw you\nget off the train at Epinay-sur-Orge--\"\n\n\"That night,\" said Monsieur Darzac, interrupting, \"at half-past ten--it\nis quite true.\"\n\nAn interval of silence followed.\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac,\" the magistrate went on in a tone of deep emotion,\n\"Monsieur Darzac, what were you doing that night, at Epinay-sur-Orge--at\nthat time?\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac remained silent, simply closing his eyes.\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac,\" insisted Monsieur de Marquet, \"can you tell me how\nyou employeeed your time, that night?\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac opened his eyes. He seemed to have recovered his\nself-control.\n\n\"No, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"Think, Monsieur! For, if you persist in your strange refusal, I shall\nbe under the painful necessity of keeping you at my disposition.\"\n\n\"I refuse.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac!--in the name of the law, I arrest you!\"\n\nThe magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw\nRouletabille move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac. He would certainly\nhave spoken to him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him off. As the\ngendarme approached his prisoner, a despairing cry rang through the\nroom:\n\n\"Robert!--Robert!\"\n\nWe recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson. We all shuddered.\nLarsan himself turned pale. Monsieur Darzac, in response to the cry, had\nflown back into the room.\n\nThe magistrate, the gendarme, and Larsan followed closely after.\nRouletabille and I remained on the threshold. It was a heart-breaking\nsight that met our eyes. Mademoiselle Stangerson, with a face of deathly\npallor, had risen on her bed, in spite of the restraining efforts of two\ndoctors and her father. She was holding out her trembling arms towards\nRobert Darzac, on whom Larsan and the gendarme had laid hands. Her\ndistended eyes saw--she understood--her lips seemed to form a word, but\nnobody made it out; and she fell back insensible.\n\nMonsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the vestibule\nto wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch. We were all overcome\nby emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had tears in his eyes.\nRouletabille took advantage of the opportunity to say to Monsieur\nDarzac:\n\n\"Are you going to put in any defense?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied the prisoner.\n\n\"Very well, then I will, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"You cannot do it,\" said the unhappy man with a faint smile.\n\n\"I can--and I will.\"\n\nRouletabille's voice had in it a strange strength and confidence.\n\n\"I can do it, Monsieur Robert Darzac, because I know more than you do!\"\n\n\"Come! Come!\" murmured Darzac, almost angrily.\n\n\"Have no fear! I shall know only what will benefit you.\"\n\n\"You must know nothing, young man, if you want me to be grateful.\"\n\nRouletabille shook his head, going close up to Darzac.\n\n\"Listen to what I am about to say,\" he said in a low tone, \"and let\nit give you confidence. You do not know the name of the murderer.\nMademoiselle Stangerson knows it; but only half of it; but I know his\ntwo halves; I know the whole man!\"\n\nRobert Darzac opened his eyes, with a look that showed he had not\nunderstood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him. At that moment\nthe conveyance arrived, driven by Frederic Larsan. Darzac and the\ngendarme entered it, Larsan remaining on the driver's seat. The prisoner\nwas taken to Corbeil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. Rouletabille Goes on a Journey\n\n\nThat same evening Rouletabille and I left the Glandier. We were very\nglad to get away and there was nothing more to keep us there. I declared\nmy intention to give up the whole matter. It had been too much for me.\nRouletabille, with a friendly tap on my shoulder, confessed that he had\nnothing more to learn at the Glandier; he had learned there all it had\nto tell him. We reached Paris about eight o'clock, dined, and then,\ntired out, we separated, agreeing to meet the next morning at my rooms.\n\nRouletabille arrived next day at the hour agreed on. He was dressed in\na suit of English tweed, with an ulster on his arm, and a valise in his\nhand. Evidently he had prepared himself for a journey.\n\n\"How long shall you be away?\" I asked.\n\n\"A month or two,\" he said. \"It all depends.\"\n\nI asked him no more questions.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he asked, \"what the word was that Mademoiselle Stangerson\ntried to say before she fainted?\"\n\n\"No--nobody heard it.\"\n\n\"I heard it!\" replied Rouletabille. \"She said 'Speak!'\"\n\n\"Do you think Darzac will speak?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nI was about to make some further observations, but he wrung my hand\nwarmly and wished me good-bye. I had only time to ask him one question\nbefore he left.\n\n\"Are you not afraid that other attempts may be made while you're away?\"\n\n\"No! Not now that Darzac is in prison,\" he answered.\n\nWith this strange remark he left. I was not to see him again until\nthe day of Darzac's trial at the court when he appeared to explain the\ninexplicable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Is Awaited with Impatience\n\n\nOn the 15th of January, that is to say, two months and a half after the\ntragic events I have narrated, the \"Epoque\" printed, as the first column\nof the front page, the following sensational article: \"The Seine-et-Oise\njury is summoned to-day to give its verdict on one of the most\nmysterious affairs in the annals of crime. There never has been a case\nwith so many obscure, incomprehensible, and inexplicable points. And yet\nthe prosecution has not hesitated to put into the prisoner's dock a\nman who is respected, esteemed, and loved by all who knew him--a young\nsavant, the hope of French science, whose whole life has been devoted to\nknowledge and truth. When Paris heard of Monsieur Robert Darzac's arrest\na unanimous cry of protest arose from all sides. The whole Sorbonne,\ndisgraced by this act of the examining magistrate, asserted its\nbelief in the innocence of Mademoiselle Stangerson's fiance. Monsieur\nStangerson was loud in his denunciation of this miscarriage of justice.\nThere is no doubt in the mind of anybody that could the victim speak she\nwould claim from the jurors of Seine-et-Oise the man she wishes to make\nher husband and whom the prosecution would send to the scaffold. It\nis to be hoped that Mademoiselle Stangerson will shortly recover her\nreason, which has been temporarily unhinged by the horrible mystery at\nthe Glandier. The question before the jury is the one we propose to deal\nwith this very day.\n\n\"We have decided not to permit twelve worthy men to commit a disgraceful\nmiscarriage of justice. We confess that the remarkable coincidences, the\nmany convicting evidences, and the inexplicable silence on the part of\nthe accused, as well as a total absence of any evidence for an alibi,\nwere enough to warrant the bench of judges in assuming that in this\nman alone was centered the truth of the affair. The evidences are,\nin appearance, so overwhelming against Monsieur Robert Darzac that a\ndetective so well informed, so intelligent, and generally so successful,\nas Monsieur Frederic Larsan, may be excused for having been misled by\nthem. Up to now everything has gone against Monsieur Robert Darzac in\nthe magisterial inquiry. To-day, however, we are going to defend him\nbefore the jury, and we are going to bring to the witness stand a light\nthat will illumine the whole mystery of the Glandier. For we possess the\ntruth.\n\n\"If we have not spoken sooner, it is because the interests of certain\nparties in the case demand that we should take that course. Our readers\nmay remember the unsigned reports we published relating to the 'Left\nfoot of the Rue Oberkampf,' at the time of the famous robbery of the\nCredit Universel, and the famous case of the 'Gold Ingots of the Mint.'\nIn both those cases we were able to discover the truth long before even\nthe excellent ingenuity of Frederic Larsan had been able to unravel\nit. These reports were written by our youngest reporter, Joseph\nRouletabille, a youth of eighteen, whose fame to-morrow will be\nworld-wide. When attention was first drawn to the Glandier case, our\nyouthful reporter was on the spot and installed in the chateau, when\nevery other representative of the press had been denied admission. He\nworked side by side with Frederic Larsan. He was amazed and terrified at\nthe grave mistake the celebrated detective was about to make, and tried\nto divert him from the false scent he was following; but the great Fred\nrefused to receive instructions from this young journalist. We know now\nwhere it brought Monsieur Robert Darzac.\n\n\"But now, France must know--the whole world must know, that, on the\nvery evening on which Monsieur Darzac was arrested, young Rouletabille\nentered our editorial office and informed us that he was about to go\naway on a journey. 'How long I shall be away,' he said, 'I cannot say;\nperhaps a month--perhaps two--perhaps three perhaps I may never return.\nHere is a letter. If I am not back on the day on which Monsieur Darzac\nis to appear before the Assize Court, have this letter opened and read\nto the court, after all the witnesses have been heard. Arrange it with\nMonsieur Darzac's counsel. Monsieur Darzac is innocent. In this letter\nis written the name of the murderer; and--that is all I have to say.\nI am leaving to get my proofs--for the irrefutable evidence of the\nmurderer's guilt.' Our reporter departed. For a long time we were\nwithout news from him; but, a week ago, a stranger called upon our\nmanager and said: 'Act in accordance with the instructions of Joseph\nRouletabille, if it becomes necessary to do so. The letter left by him\nholds the truth.' The gentleman who brought us this message would not\ngive us his name.\n\n\"To-day, the 15th of January, is the day of the trial. Joseph\nRouletabille has not returned. It may be we shall never see him again.\nThe press also counts its heroes, its martyrs to duty. It may be he is\nno longer living. We shall know how to avenge him. Our manager will,\nthis afternoon, be at the Court of Assize at Versailles, with the\nletter--the letter containing the name of the murderer!\"\n\nThose Parisians who flocked to the Assize Court at Versailles, to be\npresent at the trial of what was known as the \"Mystery of The Yellow\nRoom,\" will certainly remember the terrible crush at the Saint-Lazare\nstation. The ordinary trains were so full that special trains had to be\nmade up. The article in the \"Epoque\" had so excited the populace that\ndiscussion was rife everywhere even to the verge of blows. Partisans of\nRouletabille fought with the supporters of Frederic Larsan. Curiously\nenough the excitement was due less to the fact that an innocent man was\nin danger of a wrongful conviction than to the interest taken in their\nown ideas as to the Mystery of The Yellow Room. Each had his explanation\nto which each held fast. Those who explained the crime on Frederic\nLarsan's theory would not admit that there could be any doubt as to\nthe perspicacity of the popular detective. Others who had arrived at\na different solution, naturally insisted that this was Rouletabille's\nexplanation, though they did not as yet know what that was.\n\nWith the day's \"Epoque\" in their hands, the \"Larsans\" and the\n\"Rouletabilles\" fought and shoved each other on the steps of the Palais\nde Justice, right into the court itself. Those who could not get\nin remained in the neighbourhood until evening and were, with great\ndifficulty, kept back by the soldiery and the police. They became hungry\nfor news, welcoming the most absurd rumours. At one time the rumour\nspread that Monsieur Stangerson himself had been arrested in the court\nand had confessed to being the murderer. This goes to show to what a\npitch of madness nervous excitement may carry people. Rouletabille was\nstill expected. Some pretended to know him; and when a young man with a\n\"pass\" crossed the open space which separated the crowd from the\nCourt House, a scuffle took place. Cries were raised of\n\"Rouletabille!--there's Rouletabille!\" The arrival of the manager of the\npaper was the signal for a great demonstration. Some applauded, others\nhissed.\n\nThe trial itself was presided over by Monsieur de Rocouz, a judge\nfilled with the prejudice of his class, but a man honest at heart. The\nwitnesses had been called. I was there, of course, as were all who had,\nin any way, been in touch with the mysteries of the Glandier. Monsieur\nStangerson--looking many years older and almost unrecognisable--Larsan,\nArthur Rance, with his face ruddy as ever, Daddy Jacques, Daddy Mathieu,\nwho was brought into court handcuffed between two gendarmes, Madame\nMathieu, in tears, the two Berniers, the two nurses, the steward, all\nthe domestics of the chateau, the employeee of the Paris Post Office, the\nrailway employeee from Epinay, some friends of Monsieur and Mademoiselle\nStangerson, and all Monsieur Darzac's witnesses. I was lucky enough to\nbe called early in the trial, so that I was then able to watch and be\npresent at almost the whole of the proceedings.\n\nThe court was so crowded that many lawyers were compelled to find seats\non the steps. Behind the bench of justices were representatives from\nother benches. Monsieur Robert Darzac stood in the prisoner's dock\nbetween policemen, tall, handsome, and calm. A murmur of admiration\nrather than of compassion greeted his appearance. He leaned forward\ntowards his counsel, Maitre Henri Robert, who, assisted by his chief\nsecretary, Maitre Andre Hesse, was busily turning over the folios of his\nbrief.\n\nMany expected that Monsieur Stangerson, after giving his evidence, would\nhave gone over to the prisoner and shaken hands with him; but he left\nthe court without another word. It was remarked that the jurors appeared\nto be deeply interested in a rapid conversation which the manager of the\n\"Epoque\" was having with Maitre Henri Robert. The manager, later, sat\ndown in the front row of the public seats. Some were surprised that he\nwas not asked to remain with the other witnesses in the room reserved\nfor them.\n\nThe reading of the indictment was got through, as it always is, without\nany incident. I shall not here report the long examination to which\nMonsieur Darzac was subjected. He answered all the questions quickly\nand easily. His silence as to the important matters of which we know was\ndead against him. It would seem as if this reticence would be fatal\nfor him. He resented the President's reprimands. He was told that his\nsilence might mean death.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said; \"I will submit to it; but I am innocent.\"\n\nWith that splendid ability which has made his fame, Maitre Robert took\nadvantage of the incident, and tried to show that it brought out in\nnoble relief his client's character; for only heroic natures could\nremain silent for moral reasons in face of such a danger. The eminent\nadvocate however, only succeeded in assuring those who were already\nassured of Darzac's innocence. At the adjournment Rouletabille had not\nyet arrived. Every time a door opened, all eyes there turned towards it\nand back to the manager of the \"Epoque,\" who sat impassive in his place.\nWhen he once was feeling in his pocket a loud murmur of expectation\nfollowed. The letter!\n\nIt is not, however, my intention to report in detail the course of\nthe trial. My readers are sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries\nsurrounding the Glandier case to enable me to go on to the really\ndramatic denouement of this ever-memorable day.\n\nWhen the trial was resumed, Maitre Henri Robert questioned Daddy Mathieu\nas to his complicity in the death of the keeper. His wife was also\nbrought in and was confronted by her husband. She burst into tears and\nconfessed that she had been the keeper's mistress, and that her husband\nhad suspected it. She again, however, affirmed that he had had nothing\nto do with the murder of her lover. Maitre Henri Robert thereupon asked\nthe court to hear Frederic Larsan on this point.\n\n\"In a short conversation which I have had with Frederic Larsan, during\nthe adjournment,\" declared the advocate, \"he has made me understand that\nthe death of the keeper may have been brought about otherwise than by\nthe hand of Mathieu. It will be interesting to hear Frederic Larsan's\ntheory.\"\n\nFrederic Larsan was brought in. His explanation was quite clear.\n\n\"I see no necessity,\" he said, \"for bringing Mathieu in this. I\nhave told Monsieur de Marquet that the man's threats had biassed\nthe examining magistrate against him. To me the attempt to murder\nMademoiselle and the death of the keeper are the work of one and the\nsame person. Mademoiselle Stangerson's murderer, flying through the\ncourt, was fired on; it was thought he was struck, perhaps killed. As\na matter of fact, he only stumbled at the moment of his disappearance\nbehind the corner of the right wing of the chateau. There he encountered\nthe keeper who, no doubt, tried to seize him. The murderer had in his\nhand the knife with which he had stabbed Mademoiselle Stangerson and\nwith this he killed the keeper.\"\n\nThis very simple explanation appeared at once plausible and satisfying.\nA murmur of approbation was heard.\n\n\"And the murderer? What became of him?\" asked the President.\n\n\"He was evidently hidden in an obscure corner at the end of the court.\nAfter the people had left the court carrying with them the body of the\nkeeper, the murderer quietly made his escape.\"\n\nThe words had scarcely left Larsan's mouth when from the back of the\ncourt came a youthful voice:\n\n\"I agree with Frederic Larsan as to the death of the keeper; but I do\nnot agree with him as to the way the murderer escaped!\"\n\nEverybody turned round, astonished. The clerks of the court sprang\ntowards the speaker, calling out silence, and the President angrily\nordered the intruder to be immediately expelled. The same clear voice,\nhowever, was again heard:\n\n\"It is I, Monsieur President--Joseph Rouletabille!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears in All His Glory\n\n\nThe excitement was extreme. Cries from fainting women were to be heard\namid the extraordinary bustle and stir. The \"majesty of the law\" was\nutterly forgotten. The President tried in vain to make himself heard.\nRouletabille made his way forward with difficulty, but by dint of much\nelbowing reached his manager and greeted him cordially. The letter was\npassed to him and pocketing it he turned to the witness-box. He was\ndressed exactly as on the day he left me even to the ulster over his\narm. Turning to the President, he said:\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Monsieur President, but I have only just arrived\nfrom America. The steamer was late. My name is Joseph Rouletabille!\"\n\nThe silence which followed his stepping into the witness-box was broken\nby laughter when his words were heard. Everybody seemed relieved and\nglad to find him there, as if in the expectation of hearing the truth at\nlast.\n\nBut the President was extremely incensed:\n\n\"So, you are Joseph Rouletabille,\" he replied; \"well, young man, I'll\nteach you what comes of making a farce of justice. By virtue of my\ndiscretionary power, I hold you at the court's disposition.\"\n\n\"I ask nothing better, Monsieur President. I have come here for that\npurpose. I humbly beg the court's pardon for the disturbance of which\nI have been the innocent cause. I beg you to believe that nobody has\na greater respect for the court than I have. I came in as I could.\" He\nsmiled.\n\n\"Take him away!\" ordered the President.\n\nMaitre Henri Robert intervened. He began by apologising for the young\nman, who, he said, was moved only by the best intentions. He made the\nPresident understand that the evidence of a witness who had slept at the\nGlandier during the whole of that eventful week could not be omitted,\nand the present witness, moreover, had come to name the real murderer.\n\n\"Are you going to tell us who the murderer was?\" asked the President,\nsomewhat convinced though still sceptical.\n\n\"I have come for that purpose, Monsieur President!\" replied\nRouletabille.\n\nAn attempt at applause was silenced by the usher.\n\n\"Joseph Rouletabille,\" said Maitre Henri Robert, \"has not been regularly\nsubpoenaed as a witness, but I hope, Monsieur President, you will\nexamine him in virtue of your discretionary powers.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" said the President, \"we will question him. But we must\nproceed in order.\"\n\nThe Advocate-General rose:\n\n\"It would, perhaps, be better,\" he said, \"if the young man were to tell\nus now whom he suspects.\"\n\nThe President nodded ironically:\n\n\"If the Advocate-General attaches importance to the deposition of\nMonsieur Joseph Rouletabille, I see no reason why this witness should\nnot give us the name of the murderer.\"\n\nA pin drop could have been heard. Rouletabille stood silent looking\nsympathetically at Darzac, who, for the first time since the opening of\nthe trial, showed himself agitated.\n\n\"Well,\" cried the President, \"we wait for the name of the murderer.\"\nRouletabille, feeling in his waistcoat pocket, drew his watch and,\nlooking at it, said:\n\n\"Monsieur President, I cannot name the murderer before half-past six\no'clock!\"\n\nLoud murmurs of disappointment filled the room. Some of the lawyers were\nheard to say: \"He's making fun of us!\"\n\nThe President in a stern voice, said:\n\n\"This joke has gone far enough. You may retire, Monsieur, into the\nwitnesses' room. I hold you at our disposition.\"\n\nRouletabille protested.\n\n\"I assure you, Monsieur President,\" he cried in his sharp, clear voice,\n\"that when I do name the murderer you will understand why I could not\nspeak before half-past six. I assert this on my honour. I can, however,\ngive you now some explanation of the murder of the keeper. Monsieur\nFrederic Larsan, who has seen me at work at the Glandier, can tell you\nwith what care I studied this case. I found myself compelled to differ\nwith him in arresting Monsieur Robert Darzac, who is innocent. Monsieur\nLarsan knows of my good faith and knows that some importance may be\nattached to my discoveries, which have often corroborated his own.\"\n\nFrederic Larsan said:\n\n\"Monsieur President, it will be interesting to hear Monsieur Joseph\nRouletabille, especially as he differs from me.\"\n\nA murmur of approbation greeted the detective's speech. He was a good\nsportsman and accepted the challenge. The struggle between the two\npromised to be exciting.\n\nAs the President remained silent, Frederic Larsan continued:\n\n\"We agree that the murderer of the keeper was the assailant of\nMademoiselle Stangerson; but as we are not agreed as to how the murderer\nescaped, I am curious to hear Monsieur Rouletabille's explanation.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you are,\" said my friend.\n\nGeneral laughter followed this remark. The President angrily declared\nthat if it was repeated, he would have the court cleared.\n\n\"Now, young man,\" said the President, \"you have heard Monsieur Frederic\nLarsan; how did the murderer get away from the court?\"\n\nRouletabille looked at Madame Mathieu, who smiled back at him sadly.\n\n\"Since Madame Mathieu,\" he said, \"has freely admitted her intimacy with\nthe keeper--\"\n\n\"Why, it's the boy!\" exclaimed Daddy Mathieu.\n\n\"Remove that man!\" ordered the President.\n\nMathieu was removed from the court. Rouletabille went on:\n\n\"Since she has made this confession, I am free to tell you that she\noften met the keeper at night on the first floor of the donjon, in the\nroom which was once an oratory. These meetings became more frequent when\nher husband was laid up by his rheumatism. She gave him morphine to ease\nhis pain and to give herself more time for the meetings. Madame Mathieu\ncame to the chateau that night, enveloped in a large black shawl which\nserved also as a disguise. This was the phantom that disturbed Daddy\nJacques. She knew how to imitate the mewing of Mother Angenoux' cat\nand she would make the cries to advise the keeper of her presence. The\nrecent repairs of the donjon did not interfere with their meetings in\nthe keeper's old room, in the donjon, since the new room assigned to him\nat the end of the right wing was separated from the steward's room by a\npartition only.\n\n\"Previous to the tragedy in the courtyard Madame Mathieu and the keeper\nleft the donjon together. I learnt these facts from my examination of\nthe footmarks in the court the next morning. Bernier, the concierge,\nwhom I had stationed behind the donjon--as he will explain\nhimself--could not see what passed in the court. He did not reach the\ncourt until he heard the revolver shots, and then he fired. When the\nwoman parted from the man she went towards the open gate of the court,\nwhile he returned to his room.\n\n\"He had almost reached the door when the revolvers rang out. He had just\nreached the corner when a shadow bounded by. Meanwhile, Madame Mathieu,\nsurprised by the revolver shots and by the entrance of people into the\ncourt, crouched in the darkness. The court is a large one and, being\nnear the gate, she might easily have passed out unseen. But she remained\nand saw the body being carried away. In great agony of mind she neared\nthe vestibule and saw the dead body of her lover on the stairs lit up by\nDaddy Jacques' lantern. She then fled; and Daddy Jacques joined her.\n\n\"That same night, before the murder, Daddy Jacques had been awakened\nby the cat's cry, and, looking through his window, had seen the black\nphantom. Hastily dressing himself he went out and recognised her. He is\nan old friend of Madame Mathieu, and when she saw him she had to tell\nhim of her relations with the keeper and begged his assistance. Daddy\nJacques took pity on her and accompanied her through the oak grove out\nof the park, past the border of the lake to the road to Epinay. From\nthere it was but a very short distance to her home.\n\n\"Daddy Jacques returned to the chateau, and, seeing how important it was\nfor Madame Mathieu's presence at the chateau to remain unknown, he did\nall he could to hide it. I appeal to Monsieur Larsan, who saw me, next\nmorning, examine the two sets of footprints.\"\n\nHere Rouletabille turning towards Madame Mathieu, with a bow, said:\n\n\"The footprints of Madame bear a strange resemblance to the neat\nfootprints of the murderer.\"\n\nMadame Mathieu trembled and looked at him with wide eyes as if in wonder\nat what he would say next.\n\n\"Madame has a shapely foot, long and rather large for a woman. The\nimprint, with its pointed toe, is very like that of the murderer's.\"\n\nA movement in the court was repressed by Rouletabille. He held their\nattention at once.\n\n\"I hasten to add,\" he went on, \"that I attach no importance to this.\nOutward signs like these are often liable to lead us into error, if we\ndo not reason rightly. Monsieur Robert Darzac's footprints are also like\nthe murderer's, and yet he is not the murderer!\"\n\nThe President turning to Madame Mathieu asked:\n\n\"Is that in accordance with what you know occurred?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur President,\" she replied, \"it is as if Monsieur\nRouletabille had been behind us.\"\n\n\"Did you see the murderer running towards the end of the right wing?\"\n\n\"Yes, as clearly as I saw them afterwards carrying the keeper's body.\"\n\n\"What became of the murderer?--You were in the courtyard and could\neasily have seen.\n\n\"I saw nothing of him, Monsieur President. It became quite dark just\nthen.\"\n\n\"Then Monsieur Rouletabille,\" said the President, \"must explain how the\nmurderer made his escape.\"\n\nRouletabille continued:\n\n\"It was impossible for the murderer to escape by the way he had entered\nthe court without our seeing him; or if we couldn't see him we must\ncertainly have felt him, since the court is a very narrow one enclosed\nin high iron railings.\"\n\n\"Then if the man was hemmed in that narrow square, how is it you did not\nfind him?--I have been asking you that for the last half hour.\"\n\n\"Monsieur President,\" replied Rouletabille, \"I cannot answer that\nquestion before half-past six!\"\n\nBy this time the people in the court-room were beginning to believe in\nthis new witness. They were amused by his melodramatic action in thus\nfixing the hour; but they seemed to have confidence in the outcome. As\nfor the President, it looked as if he also had made up his mind to\ntake the young man in the same way. He had certainly been impressed by\nRouletabille's explanation of Madame Mathieu's part.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Rouletabille,\" he said, \"as you say; but don't let us\nsee any more of you before half-past six.\"\n\nRouletabille bowed to the President, and made his way to the door of the\nwitnesses' room.\n\nI quietly made my way through the crowd and left the court almost at the\nsame time as Rouletabille. He greeted me heartily, and looked happy.\n\n\"I'll not ask you, my dear fellow,\" I said, smiling, \"what you've been\ndoing in America; because I've no doubt you'll say you can't tell me\nuntil after half-past six.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Sainclair, I'll tell you right now why I went to America. I\nwent in search of the name of the other half of the murderer!\"\n\n\"The name of the other half?\"\n\n\"Exactly. When we last left the Glandier I knew there were two halves to\nthe murderer and the name of only one of them. I went to America for the\nname of the other half.\"\n\nI was too puzzled to answer. Just then we entered the witnesses' room,\nand Rouletabille was immediately surrounded. He showed himself very\nfriendly to all except Arthur Rance to whom he exhibited a marked\ncoldness of manner. Frederic Larsan came in also. Rouletabille went\nup and shook him heartily by the hand. His manner toward the detective\nshowed that he had got the better of the policeman. Larsan smiled and\nasked him what he had been doing in America, Rouletabille began by\ntelling him some anecdotes of his voyage. They then turned aside\ntogether apparently with the object of speaking confidentially. I,\ntherefore, discreetly left them and, being curious to hear the evidence,\nreturned to my seat in the court-room where the public plainly showed\nits lack of interest in what was going on in their impatience for\nRouletabille's return at the appointed time.\n\nOn the stroke of half-past six Joseph Rouletabille was again brought in.\nIt is impossible for me to picture the tense excitement which appeared\non every face, as he made his way to the bar. Darzac rose to his feet,\nfrightfully pale.\n\nThe President, addressing Rouletabille, said gravely:\n\n\"I will not ask you to take the oath, because you have not been\nregularly summoned; but I trust there is no need to urge upon you the\ngravity of the statement you are about to make.\"\n\nRouletabille looked the President quite calmly and steadily in the face,\nand replied:\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur.\"\n\n\"At your last appearance here,\" said the President, \"we had arrived at\nthe point where you were to tell us how the murderer escaped, and also\nhis name. Now, Monsieur Rouletabille, we await your explanation.\"\n\n\"Very well, Monsieur,\" began my friend amidst a profound silence. \"I\nhad explained how it was impossible for the murderer to get away without\nbeing seen. And yet he was there with us in the courtyard.\"\n\n\"And you did not see him? At least that is what the prosecution\ndeclares.\"\n\n\"No! We all of us saw him, Monsieur le President!\" cried Rouletabille.\n\n\"Then why was he not arrested?\"\n\n\"Because no one, besides myself, knew that he was the murderer. It would\nhave spoiled my plans to have had him arrested, and I had then no proof\nother than my own reasoning. I was convinced we had the murderer before\nus and that we were actually looking at him. I have now brought what I\nconsider the indisputable proof.\"\n\n\"Speak out, Monsieur! Tell us the murderer's name.\"\n\n\"You will find it on the list of names present in the court on the night\nof the tragedy,\" replied Rouletabille.\n\nThe people present in the court-room began showing impatience. Some of\nthem even called for the name, and were silenced by the usher.\n\n\"The list includes Daddy Jacques, Bernier the concierge, and Mr. Arthur\nRance,\" said the President. \"Do you accuse any of these?\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur!\"\n\n\"Then I do not understand what you are driving at. There was no other\nperson at the end of the court.\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur, there was, not at the end, but above the court, who was\nleaning out of the window.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Frederic Larsan!\" exclaimed the President.\n\n\"Yes! Frederic Larsan!\" replied Rouletabille in a ringing tone.\n\"Frederic Larsan is the murderer!\"\n\nThe court-room became immediately filled with loud and indignant\nprotests. So astonished was he that the President did not attempt to\nquiet it. The quick silence which followed was broken by the distinctly\nwhispered words from the lips of Robert Darzac:\n\n\"It's impossible! He's mad!\"\n\n\"You dare to accuse Frederic Larsan, Monsieur?\" asked the President. \"If\nyou are not mad, what are your proofs?\"\n\n\"Proofs, Monsieur?--Do you want proofs? Well, here is one,\" cried\nRouletabille shrilly. \"Let Frederic Larsan be called!\"\n\n\"Usher, call Frederic Larsan.\"\n\nThe usher hurried to the side door, opened it, and disappeared. The door\nremained open, while all eyes turned expectantly towards it. The clerk\nre-appeared and, stepping forward, said:\n\n\"Monsieur President, Frederic Larsan is not here. He left at about four\no'clock and has not been seen since.\"\n\n\"That is my proof!\" cried Rouletabille, triumphantly.\n\n\"Explain yourself?\" demanded the President.\n\n\"My proof is Larsan's flight,\" said the young reporter. \"He will not\ncome back. You will see no more of Frederic Larsan.\"\n\n\"Unless you are playing with the court, Monsieur, why did you not accuse\nhim when he was present? He would then have answered you.\"\n\n\"He could give no other answer than the one he has now given by his\nflight.\"\n\n\"We cannot believe that Larsan has fled. There was no reason for his\ndoing so. Did he know you'd make this charge?\"\n\n\"He did. I told him I would.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that knowing Larsan was the murderer you gave him\nthe opportunity to escape?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur President, I did,\" replied Rouletabille, proudly. \"I am\nnot a policeman, I am a journalist; and my business is not to arrest\npeople. My business is in the service of truth, and is not that of an\nexecutioner. If you are just, Monsieur, you will see that I am right.\nYou can now understand why I refrained until this hour to divulge the\nname. I gave Larsan time to catch the 4:17 train for Paris, where he\nwould know where to hide himself, and leave no traces. You will not find\nFrederic Larsan,\" declared Rouletabille, fixing his eyes on Monsieur\nRobert Darzac. \"He is too cunning. He is a man who has always escaped\nyou and whom you have long searched for in vain. If he did not succeed\nin outwitting me, he can yet easily outwit any police. This man who,\nfour years ago, introduced himself to the Surete, and became celebrated\nas Frederic Larsan, is notorious under another name--a name well known\nto crime. Frederic Larsan, Monsieur President, is Ballmeyer!\"\n\n\"Ballmeyer!\" cried the President.\n\n\"Ballmeyer!\" exclaimed Robert Darzac, springing to his feet.\n\"Ballmeyer!--It was true, then!\"\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur Darzac; you don't think I am mad, now!\" cried\nRouletabille.\n\nBallmeyer! Ballmeyer! No other word could be heard in the courtroom. The\nPresident adjourned the hearing.\n\nThose of my readers who may not have heard of Ballmeyer will wonder at\nthe excitement the name caused. And yet the doings of this remarkable\ncriminal form the subject-matter of the most dramatic narratives of the\nnewspapers and criminal records of the past twenty years. It had been\nreported that he was dead, and thus had eluded the police as he had\neluded them throughout the whole of his career.\n\nBallmeyer was the best specimen of the high-class \"gentleman swindler.\"\nHe was adept at sleight of hand tricks, and no bolder or more ruthless\ncrook ever lived. He was received in the best society, and was a\nmember of some of the most exclusive clubs. On many of his depredatory\nexpeditions he had not hesitated to use the knife and the mutton-bone.\nNo difficulty stopped him and no \"operation\" was too dangerous. He had\nbeen caught, but escaped on the very morning of his trial, by throwing\npepper into the eyes of the guards who were conducting him to Court. It\nwas known later that, in spite of the keen hunt after him by the\nmost expert of detectives, he had sat that same evening at a first\nperformance in the Theatre Francais, without the slightest disguise.\n\nHe left France, later, to \"work\" America. The police there succeeded in\ncapturing him once, but the extraordinary man escaped the next day. It\nwould need a volume to recount the adventures of this master-criminal.\nAnd yet this was the man Rouletabille had allowed to get away! Knowing\nall about him and who he was, he afforded the criminal an opportunity\nfor another laugh at the society he had defied! I could not help\nadmiring the bold stroke of the young journalist, because I felt certain\nhis motive had been to protect both Mademoiselle Stangerson and rid\nDarzac of an enemy at the same time.\n\nThe crowd had barely recovered from the effect of the astonishing\nrevelation when the hearing was resumed. The question in everybody's\nmind was: Admitting that Larsan was the murderer, how did he get out of\nThe Yellow Room?\n\nRouletabille was immediately called to the bar and his examination\ncontinued.\n\n\"You have told us,\" said the President, \"that it was impossible to\nescape from the end of the court. Since Larsan was leaning out of his\nwindow, he had left the court. How did he do that?\"\n\n\"He escaped by a most unusual way. He climbed the wall, sprang onto the\nterrace, and, while we were engaged with the keeper's body, reached the\ngallery by the window. He then had little else to do than to open the\nwindow, get in and call out to us, as if he had just come from his own\nroom. To a man of Ballmeyer's strength all that was mere child's play.\nAnd here, Monsieur, is the proof of what I say.\"\n\nRouletabille drew from his pocket a small packet, from which he produced\na strong iron peg.\n\n\"This, Monsieur,\" he said, \"is a spike which perfectly fits a hole still\nto be seen in the cornice supporting the terrace. Larsan, who thought\nand prepared for everything in case of any emergency, had fixed this\nspike into the cornice. All he had to do to make his escape good was to\nplant one foot on a stone which is placed at the corner of the chateau,\nanother on this support, one hand on the cornice of the keeper's door\nand the other on the terrace, and Larsan was clear of the ground. The\nrest was easy. His acting after dinner as if he had been drugged was\nmake believe. He was not drugged; but he did drug me. Of course he had\nto make it appear as if he also had been drugged so that no suspicion\nshould fall on him for my condition. Had I not been thus overpowered,\nLarsan would never have entered Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber that\nnight, and the attack on her would not have taken place.\"\n\nA groan came from Darzac, who appeared to be unable to control his\nsuffering.\n\n\"You can understand,\" added Rouletabille, \"that Larsan would feel\nhimself hampered from the fact that my room was so close to his, and\nfrom a suspicion that I would be on the watch that night. Naturally, he\ncould not for a moment believe that I suspected him! But I might see him\nleaving his room when he was about to go to Mademoiselle Stangerson.\nHe waited till I was asleep, and my friend Sainclair was busy trying to\nrouse me. Ten minutes after that Mademoiselle was calling out, \"Murder!\"\n\n\"How did you come to suspect Larsan?\" asked the President.\n\n\"My pure reason pointed to him. That was why I watched him. But I\ndid not foresee the drugging. He is very cunning. Yes, my pure reason\npointed to him; but I required tangible proof so that my eyes could see\nhim as my pure reason saw him.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by your pure reason?\"\n\n\"That power of one's mind which admits of no disturbing elements to\na conclusion. The day following the incident of 'the inexplicable\ngallery,' I felt myself losing control of it. I had allowed myself to be\ndiverted by fallacious evidence; but I recovered and again took hold of\nthe right end. I satisfied myself that the murderer could not have left\nthe gallery, either naturally or supernaturally. I narrowed the field of\nconsideration to that small circle, so to speak. The murderer could\nnot be outside that circle. Now who was in it? There was, first, the\nmurderer. Then there were Daddy Jacques, Monsieur Stangerson, Frederic\nLarsan, and myself. Five persons in all, counting in the murderer.\nAnd yet, in the gallery, there were but four. Now since it had been\ndemonstrated to me that the fifth could not have escaped, it was evident\nthat one of the four present in the gallery must be a double--he must\nbe himself and the murderer also. Why had I not seen this before? Simply\nbecause the phenomenon of the double personality had not occurred before\nin this inquiry.\n\n\"Now who of the four persons in the gallery was both that person and the\nassassin? I went over in my mind what I had seen. I had seen at one and\nthe same time, Monsieur Stangerson and the murderer, Daddy Jacques and\nthe murderer, myself and the murderer; so that the murderer, then, could\nnot be either Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy Jacques, or myself. Had I seen\nFrederic Larsan and the murderer at the same time?--No!--Two seconds had\npassed, during which I lost sight of the murderer; for, as I have noted\nin my papers, he arrived two seconds before Monsieur Stangerson, Daddy\nJacques, and myself at the meeting-point of the two galleries. That\nwould have given Larsan time to go through the 'off-turning' gallery,\nsnatch off his false beard, return, and hurry with us as if, like us, in\npursuit of the murderer. I was sure now I had got hold of the right end\nin my reasoning. With Frederic Larsan was now always associated, in\nmy mind, the personality of the unknown of whom I was in pursuit--the\nmurderer, in other words.\n\n\"That revelation staggered me. I tried to regain my balance by going\nover the evidences previously traced, but which had diverted my mind and\nled me away from Frederic Larsan. What were these evidences?\n\n\"1st. I had seen the unknown in Mademoiselle Stangerson's chamber. On\ngoing to Frederic Larsan's room, I had found Larsan sound asleep.\n\n\"2nd. The ladder.\n\n\"3rd. I had placed Frederic Larsan at the end of the 'off-turning'\ngallery and had told him that I would rush into Mademoiselle\nStangerson's room to try to capture the murderer. Then I returned to\nMademoiselle Stangerson's chamber where I had seen the unknown.\n\n\"The first evidence did not disturb me much. It is likely that, when I\ndescended from my ladder, after having seen the unknown in Mademoiselle\nStangerson's chamber, Larsan had already finished what he was doing\nthere. Then, while I was re-entering the chateau, Larsan went back to\nhis own room and, undressing himself, went to sleep.\n\n\"Nor did the second evidence trouble me. If Larsan were the murderer,\nhe could have no use for a ladder; but the ladder might have been placed\nthere to give an appearance to the murderer's entrance from without the\nchateau; especially as Larsan had accused Darzac and Darzac was not in\nthe chateau that night. Further, the ladder might have been placed there\nto facilitate Larsan's flight in case of absolute necessity.\n\n\"But the third evidence puzzled me altogether. Having placed Larsan at\nthe end of the 'off-turning gallery,' I could not explain how he had\ntaken advantage of the moment when I had gone to the left wing of the\nchateau to find Monsieur Stangerson and Daddy Jacques, to return to\nMademoiselle Stangerson's room. It was a very dangerous thing to do. He\nrisked being captured,--and he knew it. And he was very nearly captured.\nHe had not had time to regain his post, as he had certainly hoped to\ndo. He had then a very strong reason for returning to his room. As for\nmyself, when I sent Daddy Jacques to the end of the 'right gallery,' I\nnaturally thought that Larsan was still at his post. Daddy Jacques, in\ngoing to his post, had not looked, when he passed, to see whether Larsan\nwas at his post or not.\n\n\"What, then, was the urgent reason which had compelled Larsan to go to\nthe room a second time? I guessed it to be some evidence of his presence\nthere. He had left something very important in that room. What was it?\nAnd had he recovered it? I begged Madame Bernier who was accustomed to\nclean the room to look, and she found a pair of eye-glasses--this pair,\nMonsieur President!\"\n\nAnd Rouletabille drew the eye-glasses, of which we know, from his\npocket.\n\n\"When I saw these eye-glasses,\" he continued, \"I was utterly nonplussed.\nI had never seen Larsan wear eye-glasses. What did they mean? Suddenly I\nexclaimed to myself: 'I wonder if he is long-sighted?' I had never seen\nLarsan write. He might, then, be long-sighted. They would certainly\nknow at the Surete, and also know if the glasses were his. Such evidence\nwould be damning. That explained Larsan's return. I know now that\nLarsan, or Ballmeyer, is long-sighted and that these glasses belonged to\nhim.\n\n\"I now made one mistake. I was not satisfied with the evidence I had\nobtained. I wished to see the man's face. Had I refrained from this, the\nsecond terrible attack would not have occurred.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked the President, \"why should Larsan go to Mademoiselle\nStangerson's room, at all? Why should he twice attempt to murder her?\"\n\n\"Because he loves her, Monsieur President.\"\n\n\"That is certainly a reason, but-\"\n\n\"It is the only reason. He was madly in love, and because of that,\nand--other things, he was capable of committing any crime.\"\n\n\"Did Mademoiselle Stangerson know this?\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur; but she was ignorant of the fact that the man who was\npursuing her was Frederic Larsan, otherwise, of course, he would not\nhave been allowed to be at the chateau. I noticed, when he was in her\nroom after the incident in the gallery, that he kept himself in the\nshadow, and that he kept his head bent down. He was looking for the lost\neye-glasses. Mademoiselle Stangerson knew Larsan under another name.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Darzac,\" asked the President, \"did Mademoiselle Stangerson\nin any way confide in you on this matter? How is it that she has never\nspoken about it to anyone? If you are innocent, she would have wished to\nspare you the pain of being accused.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson told me nothing,\" replied Monsieur Darzac.\n\n\"Does what this young man says appear probable to you?\" the President\nasked.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson has told me nothing,\" he replied stolidly.\n\n\"How do you explain that, on the night of the murder of the keeper,\" the\nPresident asked, turning to Rouletabille, \"the murderer brought back\nthe papers stolen from Monsieur Stangerson?--How do you explain how the\nmurderer gained entrance into Mademoiselle Stangerson's locked room?\"\n\n\"The last question is easily answered. A man like Larsan, or Ballmeyer,\ncould have had made duplicate keys. As to the documents, I think Larsan\nhad not intended to steal them, at first. Closely watching Mademoiselle\nwith the purpose of preventing her marriage with Monsieur Robert Darzac,\nhe one day followed her and Monsieur into the Grands Magasins de la\nLouvre. There he got possession of the reticule which she lost, or left\nbehind. In that reticule was a key with a brass head. He did not know\nthere was any value attached to the key till the advertisement in\nthe newspapers revealed it. He then wrote to Mademoiselle, as the\nadvertisement requested. No doubt he asked for a meeting, making known\nto her that he was also the person who had for some time pursued her\nwith his love. He received no answer. He went to the Post Office and\nascertained that his letter was no longer there. He had already taken\ncomplete stock of Monsieur Darzac, and, having decided to go to any\nlengths to gain Mademoiselle Stangerson, he had planned that, whatever\nmight happen, Monsieur Darzac, his hated rival, should be the man to be\nsuspected.\n\n\"I do not think that Larsan had as yet thought of murdering Mademoiselle\nStangerson; but whatever he might do, he made sure that Monsieur Darzac\nshould suffer for it. He was very nearly of the same height as Monsieur\nDarzac and had almost the same sized feet. It would not be difficult,\nto take an impression of Monsieur Darzac's footprints, and have similar\nboots made for himself. Such tricks were mere child's play for Larsan,\nor Ballmeyer.\n\n\"Receiving no reply to his letter, he determined, since Mademoiselle\nStangerson would not come to him, that he would go to her. His plan had\nlong been formed. He had made himself master of the plans of the\nchateau and the pavilion. So that, one afternoon, while Monsieur and\nMademoiselle Stangerson were out for a walk, and while Daddy Jacques was\naway, he entered the latter by the vestibule window. He was alone, and,\nbeing in no hurry, he began examining the furniture. One of the pieces,\nresembling a safe, had a very small keyhole. That interested him! He had\nwith him the little key with the brass head, and, associating one with\nthe other, he tried the key in the lock. The door opened. He saw nothing\nbut papers. They must be very valuable to have been put away in a safe,\nand the key to which to be of so much importance. Perhaps a thought of\nblackmail occurred to him as a useful possibility in helping him in\nhis designs on Mademoiselle Stangerson. He quickly made a parcel of the\npapers and took it to the lavatory in the vestibule. Between the time of\nhis first examination of the pavilion and the night of the murder of the\nkeeper, Larsan had had time to find out what those papers contained.\nHe could do nothing with them, and they were rather compromising.\nThat night he took them back to the chateau. Perhaps he hoped that, by\nreturning the papers he might obtain some gratitude from Mademoiselle\nStangerson. But whatever may have been his reasons, he took the papers\nback and so rid himself of an encumbrance.\"\n\nRouletabille coughed. It was evident to me that he was embarrassed.\nHe had arrived at a point where he had to keep back his knowledge of\nLarsan's true motive. The explanation he had given had evidently been\nunsatisfactory. Rouletabille was quick enough to note the bad impression\nhe had made, for, turning to the President, he said: \"And now we come to\nthe explanation of the Mystery of The Yellow Room!\"\n\nA movement of chairs in the court with a rustling of dresses and an\nenergetic whispering of \"Hush!\" showed the curiosity that had been\naroused.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said the President, \"that the Mystery of The Yellow\nRoom, Monsieur Rouletabille, is wholly explained by your hypothesis.\nFrederic Larsan is the explanation. We have merely to substitute him for\nMonsieur Robert Darzac. Evidently the door of The Yellow Room was open\nat the time Monsieur Stangerson was alone, and that he allowed the man\nwho was coming out of his daughter's chamber to pass without arresting\nhim--perhaps at her entreaty to avoid all scandal.\"\n\n\"No, Monsieur President,\" protested the young man. \"You forget that,\nstunned by the attack made on her, Mademoiselle Stangerson was not in\na condition to have made such an appeal. Nor could she have locked\nand bolted herself in her room. You must also remember that Monsieur\nStangerson has sworn that the door was not open.\"\n\n\"That, however, is the only way in which it can be explained. The Yellow\nRoom was as closely shut as an iron safe. To use your own expression, it\nwas impossible for the murderer to make his escape either naturally or\nsupernaturally. When the room was broken into he was not there! He must,\ntherefore, have escaped.\"\n\n\"That does not follow.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"There was no need for him to escape--if he was not there!\"\n\n\"Not there!\"\n\n\"Evidently, not. He could not have been there, if he were not found\nthere.\"\n\n\"But, what about the evidences of his presence?\" asked the President.\n\n\"That, Monsieur President, is where we have taken hold of the wrong end.\nFrom the time Mademoiselle Stangerson shut herself in the room to the\ntime her door was burst open, it was impossible for the murderer to\nescape. He was not found because he was not there during that time.\"\n\n\"But the evidences?\"\n\n\"They have led us astray. In reasoning on this mystery we must not take\nthem to mean what they apparently mean. Why do we conclude the murderer\nwas there?--Because he left his tracks in the room? Good! But may he not\nhave been there before the room was locked. Nay, he must have been there\nbefore! Let us look into the matter of these traces and see if they do\nnot point to my conclusion.\n\n\"After the publication of the article in the 'Matin' and my\nconversation with the examining magistrate on the journey from Paris to\nEpinaysur-Orge, I was certain that The Yellow Room had been hermetically\nsealed, so to speak, and that consequently the murderer had escaped\nbefore Mademoiselle Stangerson had gone into her chamber at midnight.\n\n\"At the time I was much puzzled. Mademoiselle Stangerson could not have\nbeen her own murderer, since the evidences pointed to some other person.\nThe assassin, then, had come before. If that were so, how was it that\nMademoiselle had been attacked after? or rather, that she appeared to\nhave been attacked after? It was necessary for me to reconstruct the\noccurrence and make of it two phases--each separated from the other,\nin time, by the space of several hours. One phase in which Mademoiselle\nStangerson had really been attacked--the other phase in which those who\nheard her cries thought she was being attacked. I had not then examined\nThe Yellow Room. What were the marks on Mademoiselle Stangerson? There\nwere marks of strangulation and the wound from a hard blow on the\ntemple. The marks of strangulation did not interest me much; they might\nhave been made before, and Mademoiselle Stangerson could have concealed\nthem by a collarette, or any similar article of apparel. I had to\nsuppose this the moment I was compelled to reconstruct the occurrence by\ntwo phases. Mademoiselle Stangerson had, no doubt, her own reasons for\nso doing, since she had told her father nothing of it, and had made it\nunderstood to the examining magistrate that the attack had taken place\nin the night, during the second phase. She was forced to say that,\notherwise her father would have questioned her as to her reason for\nhaving said nothing about it.\n\n\"But I could not explain the blow on the temple. I understood it even\nless when I learned that the mutton-bone had been found in her room. She\ncould not hide the fact that she had been struck on the head, and yet\nthat wound appeared evidently to have been inflicted during the first\nphase, since it required the presence of the murderer! I thought\nMademoiselle Stangerson had hidden the wound by arranging her hair in\nbands on her forehead.\n\n\"As to the mark of the hand on the wall, that had evidently been made\nduring the first phase--when the murderer was really there. All the\ntraces of his presence had naturally been left during the first phase;\nthe mutton-bone, the black footprints, the Basque cap, the handkerchief,\nthe blood on the wall, on the door, and on the floor. If those traces\nwere still all there, they showed that Mademoiselle Stangerson--who\ndesired that nothing should be known--had not yet had time to clear them\naway. This led me to the conclusion that the two phases had taken place\none shortly after the other. She had not had the opportunity, after\nleaving her room and going back to the laboratory to her father, to get\nback again to her room and put it in order. Her father was all the time\nwith her, working. So that after the first phase she did not re-enter\nher chamber till midnight. Daddy Jacques was there at ten o'clock, as he\nwas every night; but he went in merely to close the blinds and light the\nnight-light. Owing to her disturbed state of mind she had forgotten that\nDaddy Jacques would go into her room and had begged him not to trouble\nhimself. All this was set forth in the article in the 'Matin.' Daddy\nJacques did go, however, and, in the dim light of the room, saw nothing.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Stangerson must have lived some anxious moments while\nDaddy Jacques was absent; but I think she was not aware that so many\nevidences had been left. After she had been attacked she had only time\nto hide the traces of the man's fingers on her neck and to hurry to the\nlaboratory. Had she known of the bone, the cap, and the handkerchief,\nshe would have made away with them after she had gone back to her\nchamber at midnight. She did not see them, and undressed by the\nuncertain glimmer of the night light. She went to bed, worn-out by\nanxiety and fear--a fear that had made her remain in the laboratory as\nlate as possible.\n\n\"My reasoning had thus brought me to the second phase of the tragedy,\nwhen Mademoiselle Stangerson was alone in the room. I had now to\nexplain the revolver shots fired during the second phase. Cries of\n'Help!--Murder!' had been heard. How to explain these? As to the cries,\nI was in no difficulty; since she was alone in her room these could\nresult from nightmare only. My explanation of the struggle and noise\nthat were heard is simply that in her nightmare she was haunted by the\nterrible experience she had passed through in the afternoon. In her\ndream she sees the murderer about to spring upon her and she cries,\n'Help! Murder!' Her hand wildly seeks the revolver she had placed within\nher reach on the night-table by the side of her bed, but her hand,\nstriking the table, overturns it, and the revolver, falling to the\nfloor, discharges itself, the bullet lodging in the ceiling. I knew\nfrom the first that the bullet in the ceiling must have resulted from\nan accident. Its very position suggested an accident to my mind, and\nso fell in with my theory of a nightmare. I no longer doubted that the\nattack had taken place before Mademoiselle had retired for the night.\nAfter wakening from her frightful dream and crying aloud for help, she\nhad fainted.\n\n\"My theory, based on the evidence of the shots that were heard at\nmidnight, demanded two shots--one which wounded the murderer at the time\nof his attack, and one fired at the time of the nightmare. The evidence\ngiven by the Berniers before the examining magistrate was to the effect\nthat only one shot had been heard. Monsieur Stangerson testified to\nhearing a dull sound first followed by a sharp ringing sound. The dull\nsound I explained by the falling of the marble-topped table; the ringing\nsound was the shot from the revolver. I was now convinced I was right.\nThe shot that had wounded the hand of the murderer and had caused it\nto bleed so that he left the bloody imprint on the wall was fired by\nMademoiselle in self-defence, before the second phase, when she had been\nreally attacked. The shot in the ceiling which the Berniers heard was\nthe accidental shot during the nightmare.\n\n\"I had now to explain the wound on the temple. It was not severe enough\nto have been made by means of the mutton-bone, and Mademoiselle had not\nattempted to hide it. It must have been made during the second phase. It\nwas to find this out that I went to The Yellow Room, and I obtained my\nanswer there.\"\n\nRouletabille drew a piece of white folded paper from his pocket, and\ndrew out of it an almost invisible object which he held between his\nthumb and forefinger.\n\n\"This, Monsieur President,\" he said, \"is a hair--a blond hair stained\nwith blood;--it is a hair from the head of Mademoiselle Stangerson. I\nfound it sticking to one of the corners of the overturned table. The\ncorner of the table was itself stained with blood--a tiny stain--hardly\nvisible; but it told me that, on rising from her bed, Mademoiselle\nStangerson had fallen heavily and had struck her head on the corner of\nits marble top.\n\n\"I still had to learn, in addition to the name of the assassin, which\nI did later, the time of the original attack. I learned this from\nthe examination of Mademoiselle Stangerson and her father, though\nthe answers given by the former were well calculated to deceive the\nexamining magistrate--Mademoiselle Stangerson had stated very minutely\nhow she had spent the whole of her time that day. We established the\nfact that the murderer had introduced himself into the pavilion between\nfive and six o'clock. At a quarter past six the professor and his\ndaughter had resumed their work. At five the professor had been with\nhis daughter, and since the attack took place in the professor's\nabsence from his daughter, I had to find out just when he left her.\nThe professor had stated that at the time when he and his daughter were\nabout to re-enter the laboratory he was met by the keeper and held\nin conversation about the cutting of some wood and the poachers.\nMademoiselle Stangerson was not with him then since the professor said:\n'I left the keeper and rejoined my daughter who was at work in the\nlaboratory.'\n\n\"It was during that short interval of time that the tragedy took place.\nThat is certain. In my mind's eye I saw Mademoiselle Stangerson re-enter\nthe pavilion, go to her room to take off her hat, and find herself faced\nby the murderer. He had been in the pavilion for some time waiting for\nher. He had arranged to pass the whole night there. He had taken off\nDaddy Jacques's boots; he had removed the papers from the cabinet; and\nhad then slipped under the bed. Finding the time long, he had risen,\ngone again into the laboratory, then into the vestibule, looked into\nthe garden, and had seen, coming towards the pavilion, Mademoiselle\nStangerson--alone. He would never have dared to attack her at that hour,\nif he had not found her alone. His mind was made up. He would be more at\nease alone with Mademoiselle Stangerson in the pavilion, than he would\nhave been in the middle of the night, with Daddy Jacques sleeping in\nthe attic. So he shut the vestibule window. That explains why neither\nMonsieur Stangerson, nor the keeper, who were at some distance from the\npavilion, had heard the revolver shot.\n\n\"Then he went back to The Yellow Room. Mademoiselle Stangerson came in.\nWhat passed must have taken place very quickly. Mademoiselle tried to\ncall for help; but the man had seized her by the throat. Her hand had\nsought and grasped the revolver which she had been keeping in the\ndrawer of her night-table, since she had come to fear the threats of\nher pursuer. The murderer was about to strike her on the head with the\nmutton-bone--a terrible weapon in the hands of a Larsan or Ballmeyer;\nbut she fired in time, and the shot wounded the hand that held the\nweapon. The bone fell to the floor covered with the blood of the\nmurderer, who staggered, clutched at the wall for support--imprinting on\nit the red marks--and, fearing another bullet, fled.\n\n\"She saw him pass through the laboratory, and listened. He was long at\nthe window. At length he jumped from it. She flew to it and shut it. The\ndanger past, all her thoughts were of her father. Had he either seen\nor heard? At any cost to herself she must keep this from him. Thus\nwhen Monsieur Stangerson returned, he found the door of The Yellow Room\nclosed, and his daughter in the laboratory, bending over her desk, at\nwork!\"\n\nTurning towards Monsieur Darzac, Rouletabille cried: \"You know the\ntruth! Tell us, then, if that is not how things happened.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" replied Monsieur Darzac.\n\n\"I admire you for your silence,\" said Rouletabille, \"but if\nMademoiselle Stangerson knew of your danger, she would release you from\nyour oath. She would beg of you to tell all she has confided to you. She\nwould be here to defend you!\"\n\nMonsieur Darzac made no movement, nor uttered a word. He looked at\nRouletabille sadly.\n\n\"However,\" said the young reporter, \"since Mademoiselle is not here, I\nmust do it myself. But, believe me, Monsieur Darzac, the only means to\nsave Mademoiselle Stangerson and restore her to her reason, is to secure\nyour acquittal.\"\n\n\"What is this secret motive that compels Mademoiselle Stangerson to hide\nher knowledge from her father?\" asked the President.\n\n\"That, Monsieur, I do not know,\" said Rouletabille. \"It is no business\nof mine.\"\n\nThe President, turning to Monsieur Darzac, endeavoured to induce him to\ntell what he knew.\n\n\"Do you still refuse, Monsieur, to tell us how you employeeed your time\nduring the attempts on the life of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you anything, Monsieur.\"\n\nThe President turned to Rouletabille as if appealing for an explanation.\n\n\"We must assume, Monsieur President, that Monsieur Robert Darzac's\nabsences are closely connected with Mademoiselle Stangerson's secret,\nand that Monsieur Darzac feels himself in honour bound to remain silent.\nIt may be that Larsan, who, since his three attempts, has had everything\nin training to cast suspicion on Monsieur Darzac, had fixed on just\nthose occasions for a meeting with Monsieur Darzac at a spot most\ncompromising. Larsan is cunning enough to have done that.\"\n\nThe President seemed partly convinced, but still curious, he asked:\n\n\"But what is this secret of Mademoiselle Stangerson?\"\n\n\"That I cannot tell you,\" said Rouletabille. \"I think, however, you\nknow enough now to acquit Monsieur Robert Darzac! Unless Larsan should\nreturn, and I don't think he will,\" he added, with a laugh.\n\n\"One question more,\" said the President. \"Admitting your explanation, we\nknow that Larsan wished to turn suspicion on Monsieur Robert Darzac, but\nwhy should he throw suspicion on Daddy Jacques also?\"\n\n\"There came in the professional detective, Monsieur, who proves himself\nan unraveller of mysteries, by annihilating the very proofs he had\naccumulated. He's a very cunning man, and a similar trick had often\nenabled him to turn suspicion from himself. He proved the innocence of\none before accusing the other. You can easily believe, Monsieur, that so\ncomplicated a scheme as this must have been long and carefully thought\nout in advance by Larsan. I can tell you that he had long been\nengaged on its elaboration. If you care to learn how he had gathered\ninformation, you will find that he had, on one occasion, disguised\nhimself as the commissionaire between the 'Laboratory of the Surete' and\nMonsieur Stangerson, of whom 'experiments' were demanded. In this way\nhe had been able before the crime, on two occasions to take stock of the\npavilion. He had 'made up' so that Daddy Jacques had not recognised him.\nAnd yet Larsan had found the opportunity to rob the old man of a pair of\nold boots and a cast-off Basque cap, which the servant had tied up in\na handkerchief, with the intention of carrying them to a friend, a\ncharcoal-burner on the road to Epinay. When the crime was discovered,\nDaddy Jacques had immediately recognised these objects as his. They were\nextremely compromising, which explains his distress at the time when we\nspoke to him about them. Larsan confessed it all to me. He is an\nartist at the game. He did a similar thing in the affair of the 'Credit\nUniversel,' and in that of the 'Gold Ingots of the Mint.' Both these\ncases should be revised. Since Ballmeyer or Larsan has been in the\nSurete a number of innocent persons have been sent to prison.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. In Which It Is Proved That One Does Not Always Think of\nEverything\n\n\nGreat excitement prevailed when Rouletabille had finished. The\ncourt-room became agitated with the murmurings of suppressed applause.\nMaitre Henri Robert called for an adjournment of the trial and was\nsupported in his motion by the public prosecutor himself. The case was\nadjourned. The next day Monsieur Robert Darzac was released on bail,\nwhile Daddy Jacques received the immediate benefit of a \"no cause for\naction.\" Search was everywhere made for Frederic Larsan, but in vain.\nMonsieur Darzac finally escaped the awful calamity which, at one time,\nhad threatened him. After a visit to Mademoiselle Stangerson, he was led\nto hope that she might, by careful nursing, one day recover her reason.\n\nRouletabille, naturally, became the \"man of the hour.\" On leaving the\nPalais de Justice, the crowd bore him aloft in triumph. The press of\nthe whole world published his exploits and his photograph. He, who\nhad interviewed so many illustrious personages, had himself become\nillustrious and was interviewed in his turn. I am glad to say that the\nenormous success in no way turned his head.\n\nWe left Versailles together, after having dined at \"The Dog That\nSmokes.\" In the train I put a number of questions to him which, during\nour meal, had been on the tip of my tongue, but which I had refrained\nfrom uttering, knowing he did not like to talk \"shop\" while eating.\n\n\"My friend,\" I said, \"that Larsan case is wonderful. It is worthy of\nyou.\"\n\nHe begged me to say no more, and humorously pretended an anxiety for\nme should I give way to silly praise of him because of a personal\nadmiration for his ability.\n\n\"I'll come to the point, then,\" I said, not a little nettled. \"I am\nstill in the dark as to your reason for going to America. When you\nleft the Glandier you had found out, if I rightly understand, all about\nFrederic Larsan; you had discovered the exact way he had attempted the\nmurder?\"\n\n\"Quite so. And you,\" he said, turning the conversation, \"did you suspect\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\n\"It's incredible!\"\n\n\"I don't see how I could have suspected anything. You took great pains\nto conceal your thoughts from me. Had you already suspected Larsan when\nyou sent for me to bring the revolvers?\"\n\n\"Yes! I had come to that conclusion through the incident of the\n'inexplicable gallery.' Larsan's return to Mademoiselle Stangerson's\nroom, however, had not then been cleared up by the eye-glasses. My\nsuspicions were the outcome of my reasoning only; and the idea of Larsan\nbeing the murderer seemed so extraordinary that I resolved to wait for\nactual evidence before venturing to act. Nevertheless, the suspicion\nworried me, and I sometimes spoke to the detective in a way that ought\nto have opened your eyes. I spoke disparagingly of his methods. But\nuntil I found the eye-glasses I could but look upon my suspicion of him\nin the light of an absurd hypothesis only. You can imagine my elation\nafter I had explained Larsan's movements. I remember well rushing into\nmy room like a mad-man and crying to you: 'I'll get the better of\nthe great Fred. I'll get the better of him in a way that will make a\nsensation!'\n\n\"I was then thinking of Larsan, the murderer. It was that same evening\nthat Darzac begged me to watch over Mademoiselle Stangerson. I made no\nefforts until after we had dined with Larsan, until ten o'clock. He was\nright there before me, and I could afford to wait. You ought to have\nsuspected, because when we were talking of the murderer's arrival, I\nsaid to you: 'I am quite sure Larsan will be here to-night.'\n\n\"But one important point escaped us both. It was one which ought to\nhave opened our eyes to Larsan. Do you remember the bamboo cane? I was\nsurprised to find Larsan had made no use of that evidence against Robert\nDarzac. Had it not been purchased by a man whose description tallied\nexactly with that of Darzac? Well, just before I saw him off at the\ntrain, after the recess during the trial, I asked him why he hadn't used\nthe cane evidence. He told me he had never had any intention of doing\nso; that our discovery of it in the little inn at Epinay had much\nembarrassed him. If you will remember, he told us then that the cane had\nbeen given him in London. Why did we not immediately say to ourselves:\n'Fred is lying. He could not have had this cane in London. He was not\nin London. He bought it in Paris'? Then you found out, on inquiry at\nCassette's, that the cane had been bought by a person dressed very like\nRobert Darzac, though, as we learned later, from Darzac himself, it was\nnot he who had made the purchase. Couple this with the fact we already\nknew, from the letter at the poste restante, that there was actually\na man in Paris who was passing as Robert Darzac, why did we not\nimmediately fix on Fred himself?\n\n\"Of course, his position at the Surete was against us; but when we saw\nthe evident eagerness on his part to find convicting evidence against\nDarzac, nay, even the passion he displayed in his pursuit of the man,\nthe lie about the cane should have had a new meaning for us. If you\nask why Larsan bought the cane, if he had no intention of manufacturing\nevidence against Darzac by means of it, the answer is quite simple. He\nhad been wounded in the hand by Mademoiselle Stangerson, so that the\ncane was useful to enable him to close his hand in carrying it. You\nremember I noticed that he always carried it?\n\n\"All these details came back to my mind when I had once fixed on Larsan\nas the criminal. But they were too late then to be of any use to me. On\nthe evening when he pretended to be drugged I looked at his hand and saw\na thin silk bandage covering the signs of a slight healing wound. Had we\ntaken a quicker initiative at the time Larsan told us that lie about the\ncane, I am certain he would have gone off, to avoid suspicion. All the\nsame, we worried Larsan or Ballmeyer without our knowing it.\"\n\n\"But,\" I interrupted, \"if Larsan had no intention of using the cane as\nevidence against Darzac, why had he made himself up to look like the man\nwhen he went in to buy it?\"\n\n\"He had not specially 'made up' as Darzac to buy the cane; he had come\nstraight to Cassette's immediately after he had attacked Mademoiselle\nStangerson. His wound was troubling him and, as he was passing along the\nAvenue de l'Opera, the idea of the cane came to his mind and he acted on\nit. It was then eight o'clock. And I, who had hit upon the very hour of\nthe occurrence of the tragedy, almost convinced that Darzac was not the\ncriminal, and knowing of the cane, I still never suspected Larsan. There\nare times...\"\n\n\"There are times,\" I said, \"when the greatest intellects--...\"\nRouletabille shut my mouth. I still continued to chide him, but, finding\nhe did not reply, I saw he was no longer paying any attention to what I\nwas saying. I found he was fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. The Mystery of Mademoiselle Stangerson\n\n\nDuring the days that followed I had several opportunities to question\nhim as to his reason for his voyage to America, but I obtained no more\nprecise answers than he had given me on the evening of the adjournment\nof the trial, when we were on the train for Paris. One day, however, on\nmy still pressing him, he said:\n\n\"Can't you understand that I had to know Larsan's true personality?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I said, \"but why did you go to America to find that out?\"\n\nHe sat smoking his pipe, and made no further reply. I began to see that\nI was touching on the secret that concerned Mademoiselle Stangerson.\nRouletabille evidently had found it necessary to go to America to find\nout what the mysterious tie was that bound her to Larsan by so strange\nand terrible a bond. In America he had learned who Larsan was and\nhad obtained information which closed his mouth. He had been to\nPhiladelphia.\n\nAnd now, what was this mystery which held Mademoiselle Stangerson and\nMonsieur Robert Darzac in so inexplicable a silence? After so many years\nand the publicity given the case by a curious and shameless press; now\nthat Monsieur Stangerson knows all and has forgiven all, all may be\ntold. In every phase of this remarkable story Mademoiselle Stangerson\nhad always been the sufferer.\n\nThe beginning dates from the time when, as a young girl, she was living\nwith her father in Philadelphia. A visitor at the house, a Frenchman,\nhad succeeded by his wit, grace and persistent attention, in gaining\nher affections. He was said to be rich and had asked her of her father.\nMonsieur Stangerson, on making inquiries as to Monsieur Jean Roussel,\nfound that the man was a swindler and an adventurer. Jean Roussel was\nbut another of the many names under which the notorious Ballmeyer, a\nfugitive from France, tried to hide himself. Monsieur Stangerson did not\nknow of his identity with Ballmeyer; he learned that the man was simply\nundesirable for his daughter. He not only refused to give his consent\nto the marriage but denied him admission into the house. Mathilde\nStangerson, however, had fallen in love. To her Jean Roussel was\neverything that her love painted him. She was indignant at her father's\nattitude, and did not conceal her feelings. Her father sent her to stay\nwith an aunt in Cincinnati. There she was joined by Jean Roussel and, in\nspite of the reverence she felt for her father, ran away with him to get\nmarried.\n\nThey went to Louisville and lived there for some time. One morning,\nhowever, a knock came at the door of the house in which they were and\nthe police entered to arrest Jean Roussel. It was then that Mathilde\nStangerson, or Roussel, learned that her husband was no other than the\nnotorious Ballmeyer!\n\nThe young woman in her despair tried to commit suicide. She failed in\nthis, and was forced to rejoin her aunt in Cincinnati, The old lady was\noverjoyed to see her again. She had been anxiously searching for her and\nhad not dared to tell Monsieur Stangerson of her disappearance. Mathilde\nswore her to secrecy, so that her father should not know she had been\naway. A month later, Mademoiselle Stangerson returned to her father,\nrepentant, her heart dead within her, hoping only one thing: that she\nwould never again see her husband, the horrible Ballmeyer. A report was\nspread, a few weeks later, that he was dead, and she now determined\nto atone for her disobedience by a life of labour and devotion for her\nfather. And she kept her word.\n\nAll this she had confessed to Robert Darzac, and, believing Ballmeyer\ndead, had given herself to the joy of a union with him. But fate had\nresuscitated Jean Roussel--the Ballmeyer of her youth. He had\ntaken steps to let her know that he would never allow her to marry\nDarzac--that he still loved her.\n\nMademoiselle Stangerson never for one moment hesitated to confide in\nMonsieur Darzac. She showed him the letter in which Jean Roussel asked\nher to recall the first hours of their union in their beautiful and\ncharming Louisville home. \"The presbytery has lost nothing of its charm,\nnor the garden its brightness,\" he had written. The scoundrel pretended\nto be rich and claimed the right of taking her back to Louisville. She\nhad told Darzac that if her father should know of her dishonour, she\nwould kill herself. Monsieur Darzac had sworn to silence her persecutor,\neven if he had to kill him. He was outwitted and would have succumbed\nhad it not been for the genius of Rouletabille.\n\nMademoiselle Stangerson was herself helpless in the hands of such a\nvillain. She had tried to kill him when he had first threatened and then\nattacked her in The Yellow Room. She had, unfortunately, failed, and\nfelt herself condemned to be for ever at the mercy of this unscrupulous\nwretch who was continually demanding her presence at clandestine\ninterviews. When he sent her the letter through the Post Office, asking\nher to meet him, she had refused. The result of her refusal was the\ntragedy of The Yellow Room. The second time he wrote asking for a\nmeeting, the letter reaching her in her sick chamber, she had avoided\nhim by sleeping with her servants. In that letter the scoundrel had\nwarned her that, since she was too ill to come to him, he would come\nto her, and that he would be in her chamber at a particular hour on\na particular night. Knowing that she had everything to fear from\nBallmeyer, she had left her chamber on that night. It was then that the\nincident of the \"inexplicable gallery\" occurred.\n\nThe third time she had determined to keep the appointment. He asked for\nit in the letter he had written in her own room, on the night of the\nincident in the gallery, which he left on her desk. In that letter he\nthreatened to burn her father's papers if she did not meet him. It was\nto rescue these papers that she made up her mind to see him. She did not\nfor one moment doubt that the wretch would carry out his threat if she\npersisted in avoiding him, and in that case the labours of her father's\nlifetime would be for ever lost. Since the meeting was thus inevitable,\nshe resolved to see her husband and appeal to his better nature. It was\nfor this interview that she had prepared herself on the night the keeper\nwas killed. They did meet, and what passed between them may be imagined.\nHe insisted that she renounce Darzac. She, on her part, affirmed her\nlove for him. He stabbed her in his anger, determined to convict Darzac\nof the crime. As Larsan he could do it, and had so managed things that\nDarzac could never explain how he had employeeed the time of his absence\nfrom the chateau. Ballmeyer's precautions were most cunningly taken.\n\nLarsan had threatened Darzac as he had threatened Mathilde--with the\nsame weapon, and the same threats. He wrote Darzac urgent letters,\ndeclaring himself ready to deliver up the letters that had passed\nbetween him and his wife, and to leave them for ever, if he would pay\nhim his price. He asked Darzac to meet him for the purpose of arranging\nthe matter, appointing the time when Larsan would be with Mademoiselle\nStangerson. When Darzac went to Epinay, expecting to find Ballmeyer or\nLarsan there, he was met by an accomplice of Larsan's, and kept waiting\nuntil such time as the \"coincidence\" could be established.\n\nIt was all done with Machiavellian cunning; but Ballmeyer had reckoned\nwithout Joseph Rouletabille.\n\nNow that the Mystery of The Yellow Room has been cleared up, this is not\nthe time to tell of Rouletabille's adventures in America. Knowing the\nyoung reporter as we do, we can understand with what acumen he had\ntraced, step by step, the story of Mathilde Stangerson and Jean Roussel.\nAt Philadelphia he had quickly informed himself as to Arthur William\nRance. There he learned of Rance's act of devotion and the reward\nhe thought himself entitled to for it. A rumour of his marriage with\nMademoiselle Stangerson had once found its way into the drawing-rooms of\nPhiladelphia. He also learned of Rance's continued attentions to her and\nhis importunities for her hand. He had taken to drink, he had said, to\ndrown his grief at his unrequited love. It can now be understood why\nRouletabille had shown so marked a coolness of demeanour towards Rance\nwhen they met in the witnesses' room, on the day of the trial.\n\nThe strange Roussel-Stangerson mystery had now been laid bare. Who was\nthis Jean Roussel? Rouletabille had traced him from Philadelphia to\nCincinnati. In Cincinnati he became acquainted with the old aunt, and\nhad found means to open her mouth. The story of Ballmeyer's arrest threw\nthe right light on the whole story. He visited the \"presbytery\"--a small\nand pretty dwelling in the old colonial style--which had, indeed,\n\"lost nothing of its charm.\" Then, abandoning his pursuit of traces of\nMademoiselle Stangerson, he took up those of Ballmeyer. He followed them\nfrom prison to prison, from crime to crime. Finally, as he was about\nleaving for Europe, he learned in New York that Ballmeyer had, five\nyears before, embarked for France with some valuable papers belonging to\na merchant of New Orleans whom he had murdered.\n\nAnd yet the whole of this mystery has not been revealed. Mademoiselle\nStangerson had a child, by her husband,--a son. The infant was born in\nthe old aunt's house. No one knew of it, so well had the aunt managed to\nconceal the event.\n\nWhat became of that son?--That is another story which, so far, I am not\npermitted to relate.\n\nAbout two months after these events, I came upon Rouletabille sitting on\na bench in the Palais de Justice, looking very depressed.\n\n\"What's the matter, old man?\" I asked. \"You are looking very downcast.\nHow are your friends getting on?\"\n\n\"Apart from you,\" he said, \"I have no friends.\"\n\n\"I hope that Monsieur Darzac--\"\n\n\"No doubt.\"\n\n\"And Mademoiselle Stangerson--How is she?\"\n\n\"Better--much better.\"\n\n\"Then you ought not to be sad.\"\n\n\"I am sad,\" he said, \"because I am thinking of the perfume of the lady\nin black--\"\n\n\"The perfume of the lady in black!--I have heard you often refer to it.\nTell me why it troubles you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps--some day; some day,\" said Rouletabille.\n\nAnd he heaved a profound sigh.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Mystery of the Yellow Room, by Gaston Leroux\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERY OF THE YELLOW ROOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1685.txt or 1685.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/6\/8\/1685\/\n\nProduced by Anonymous Project Gutenberg volunteers\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.
