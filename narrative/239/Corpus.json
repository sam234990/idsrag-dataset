{"ori_id":"37fa67ed55fc62766b9a5f0edcafcc360131aebb","title":"Women in Love","context":"Women in Love\n Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen are sisters living in The Midlands in England in the 1910s. Ursula is a teacher, Gudrun an artist. They meet two men who live nearby, school inspector Rupert Birkin and coal-mine heir Gerald Crich, and the four become friends. Ursula and Birkin become involved, and Gudrun and Gerald eventually begin a love affair.\nAll four are deeply concerned with questions of society, politics, and the relationship between men and women. At a party at Gerald's estate, Gerald's sister Diana drowns. Gudrun becomes the teacher and mentor of Gerald's youngest sister. Soon Gerald's coal-mine-owning father dies as well, after a long illness. After the funeral, Gerald goes to Gudrun's house and spends the night with her while her parents sleep in another room.\nBirkin asks Ursula to marry him, and she agrees. Gerald and Gudrun's relationship, however, becomes stormy.\nThe two couples holiday in the Alps. Gudrun begins an intense friendship with Loerke, a physically puny but emotionally commanding artist from Dresden. Gerald, enraged by Loerke and most of all by Gudrun's verbal abuse and rejection of his manhood, and driven by the his own internal violence, tries to strangle Gudrun. Before he has killed her, however, he realises that this is not what he wants, and he leaves Gudrun and Loerke, and climbs the mountain, eventually slips into a snowy valley where he falls asleep, and freezes to death.\nThe impact of Gerald's death upon Birkin is profound. The novel ends a few weeks after Gerald's death with Birkin trying to explain to Ursula that he needs Gerald as he needs her; her for the perfect relationship with a woman, and Gerald for the perfect relationship with a man.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00bf\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Women in Love, by D.

Ursula was stitching a\npiece of brightly-coloured embroidery, and Gudrun was drawing upon a\nboard which she held on her knee. They were mostly silent, talking as\ntheir thoughts strayed through their minds.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you _really want_ to get married?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula\nlaid her embroidery in her lap and looked up. Her face was calm and\nconsiderate.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt depends how you mean.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun was slightly taken aback. She watched her sister for some\nmoments.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, ironically, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit usually means one thing! But don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nyou think anyhow, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d be\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she darkened slightly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cin a better\nposition than you are in now.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA shadow came over Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI might,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not sure.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain Gudrun paused, slightly irritated. She wanted to be quite\ndefinite.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think one needs the _experience_ of having been married?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think it need _be_ an experience?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBound to be, in some way or other,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, coolly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPossibly\nundesirable, but bound to be an experience of some sort.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot really,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMore likely to be the end of experience.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun sat very still, to attend to this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s _that_ to consider.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d This brought the\nconversation to a close. Gudrun, almost angrily, took up her rubber and\nbegan to rub out part of her drawing. Ursula stitched absorbedly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t consider a good offer?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve rejected several,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Really!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun flushed dark\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut anything really worth while? Have\nyou _really?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA thousand a year, and an awfully nice man. I liked him awfully,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nUrsula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally! But weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you fearfully tempted?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn the abstract but not in the concrete,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhen it comes\nto the point, one isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t even tempted\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094oh, if I were tempted, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d marry\nlike a shot. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m only tempted _not_ to.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The faces of both sisters\nsuddenly lit up with amusement.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it an amazing thing,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chow strong the temptation\nis, not to!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d They both laughed, looking at each other. In their hearts\nthey were frightened.\n\nThere was a long pause, whilst Ursula stitched and Gudrun went on with\nher sketch. The sisters were women, Ursula twenty-six, and Gudrun\ntwenty-five. But both had the remote, virgin look of modern girls,\nsisters of Artemis rather than of Hebe. Gudrun was very beautiful,\npassive, soft-skinned, soft-limbed. She wore a dress of dark-blue silky\nstuff, with ruches of blue and green linen lace in the neck and\nsleeves; and she had emerald-green stockings. Her look of confidence\nand diffidence contrasted with Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sensitive expectancy. The\nprovincial people, intimidated by Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s perfect _sang-froid_ and\nexclusive bareness of manner, said of her: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe is a smart woman.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She\nhad just come back from London, where she had spent several years,\nworking at an art-school, as a student, and living a studio life.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI was hoping now for a man to come along,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun said, suddenly\ncatching her underlip between her teeth, and making a strange grimace,\nhalf sly smiling, half anguish. Ursula was afraid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo you have come home, expecting him here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh my dear,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, strident, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go out of my way to\nlook for him. But if there did happen to come along a highly attractive\nindividual of sufficient means\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094well\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she tailed off ironically. Then\nshe looked searchingly at Ursula, as if to probe her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you find\nyourself getting bored?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked of her sister. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you find, that\nthings fail to materialize? _Nothing materializes!_ Everything withers\nin the bud.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat withers in the bud?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, everything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094oneself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094things in general.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d There was a pause, whilst\neach sister vaguely considered her fate.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt does frighten one,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, and again there was a pause. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut\ndo you hope to get anywhere by just marrying?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt seems to be the inevitable next step,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. Ursula pondered\nthis, with a little bitterness. She was a class mistress herself, in\nWilley Green Grammar School, as she had been for some years.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit seems like that when one thinks in the\nabstract. But really imagine it: imagine any man one knows, imagine him\ncoming home to one every evening, and saying \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Hello,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 and giving one a\nkiss\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a blank pause.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, in a narrowed voice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s just impossible. The man\nmakes it impossible.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s children\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula doubtfully.\n\nGudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face hardened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you _really_ want children, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked coldly. A dazzled,\nbaffled look came on Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne feels it is still beyond one,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Do_ you feel like that?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI get no feeling whatever\nfrom the thought of bearing children.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun looked at Ursula with a masklike, expressionless face. Ursula\nknitted her brows.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t genuine,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she faltered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps one doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really\nwant them, in one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soul\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094only superficially.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d A hardness came over\nGudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face. She did not want to be too definite.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhen one thinks of other people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s children\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\nAgain Gudrun looked at her sister, almost hostile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExactly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, to close the conversation.\n\nThe two sisters worked on in silence, Ursula having always that strange\nbrightness of an essential flame that is caught, meshed, contravened.\nShe lived a good deal by herself, to herself, working, passing on from\nday to day, and always thinking, trying to lay hold on life, to grasp\nit in her own understanding. Her active living was suspended, but\nunderneath, in the darkness, something was coming to pass. If only she\ncould break through the last integuments! She seemed to try and put her\nhands out, like an infant in the womb, and she could not, not yet.\nStill she had a strange prescience, an intimation of something yet to\ncome.\n\nShe laid down her work and looked at her sister. She thought Gudrun so\n_charming_, so infinitely charming, in her softness and her fine,\nexquisite richness of texture and delicacy of line. There was a certain\nplayfulness about her too, such a piquancy or ironic suggestion, such\nan untouched reserve. Ursula admired her with all her soul.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy did you come home, Prune?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nGudrun knew she was being admired. She sat back from her drawing and\nlooked at Ursula, from under her finely-curved lashes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy did I come back, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have asked myself a\nthousand times.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you know?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I think I do. I think my coming back home was just _reculer pour\nmieux sauter_.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she looked with a long, slow look of knowledge at Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, looking slightly dazzled and falsified, and as\nif she did _not_ know. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut where can one jump to?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, somewhat superbly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf one jumps\nover the edge, one is bound to land somewhere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it very risky?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula.\n\nA slow mocking smile dawned on Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said laughing. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it all but words!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And so again she\nclosed the conversation. But Ursula was still brooding.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd how do you find home, now you have come back to it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nGudrun paused for some moments, coldly, before answering. Then, in a\ncold truthful voice, she said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI find myself completely out of it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd father?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun looked at Ursula, almost with resentment, as if brought to bay.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t thought about him: I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve refrained,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said coldly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d wavered Ursula; and the conversation was really at an end. The\nsisters found themselves confronted by a void, a terrifying chasm, as\nif they had looked over the edge.\n\nThey worked on in silence for some time, Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cheek was flushed\nwith repressed emotion. She resented its having been called into being.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we go out and look at that wedding?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked at length, in a\nvoice that was too casual.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, too eagerly, throwing aside her sewing and leaping\nup, as if to escape something, thus betraying the tension of the\nsituation and causing a friction of dislike to go over Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nerves.\n\nAs she went upstairs, Ursula was aware of the house, of her home round\nabout her. And she loathed it, the sordid, too-familiar place! She was\nafraid at the depth of her feeling against the home, the milieu, the\nwhole atmosphere and condition of this obsolete life. Her feeling\nfrightened her.\n\nThe two girls were soon walking swiftly down the main road of Beldover,\na wide street, part shops, part dwelling-houses, utterly formless and\nsordid, without poverty. Gudrun, new from her life in Chelsea and\nSussex, shrank cruelly from this amorphous ugliness of a small colliery\ntown in the Midlands. Yet forward she went, through the whole sordid\ngamut of pettiness, the long amorphous, gritty street. She was exposed\nto every stare, she passed on through a stretch of torment. It was\nstrange that she should have chosen to come back and test the full\neffect of this shapeless, barren ugliness upon herself. Why had she\nwanted to submit herself to it, did she still want to submit herself to\nit, the insufferable torture of these ugly, meaningless people, this\ndefaced countryside? She felt like a beetle toiling in the dust. She\nwas filled with repulsion.\n\nThey turned off the main road, past a black patch of common-garden,\nwhere sooty cabbage stumps stood shameless. No one thought to be\nashamed. No one was ashamed of it all.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is like a country in an underworld,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe colliers\nbring it above-ground with them, shovel it up. Ursula, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s marvellous,\nit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s really marvellous\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s really wonderful, another world. The people\nare all ghouls, and everything is ghostly. Everything is a ghoulish\nreplica of the real world, a replica, a ghoul, all soiled, everything\nsordid. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s like being mad, Ursula.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe sisters were crossing a black path through a dark, soiled field. On\nthe left was a large landscape, a valley with collieries, and opposite\nhills with cornfields and woods, all blackened with distance, as if\nseen through a veil of crape. White and black smoke rose up in steady\ncolumns, magic within the dark air. Near at hand came the long rows of\ndwellings, approaching curved up the hill-slope, in straight lines\nalong the brow of the hill. They were of darkened red brick, brittle,\nwith dark slate roofs. The path on which the sisters walked was black,\ntrodden-in by the feet of the recurrent colliers, and bounded from the\nfield by iron fences; the stile that led again into the road was rubbed\nshiny by the moleskins of the passing miners. Now the two girls were\ngoing between some rows of dwellings, of the poorer sort. Women, their\narms folded over their coarse aprons, standing gossiping at the end of\ntheir block, stared after the Brangwen sisters with that long,\nunwearying stare of aborigines; children called out names.\n\nGudrun went on her way half dazed. If this were human life, if these\nwere human beings, living in a complete world, then what was her own\nworld, outside? She was aware of her grass-green stockings, her large\ngrass-green velour hat, her full soft coat, of a strong blue colour.\nAnd she felt as if she were treading in the air, quite unstable, her\nheart was contracted, as if at any minute she might be precipitated to\nthe ground. She was afraid.\n\nShe clung to Ursula, who, through long usage was inured to this\nviolation of a dark, uncreated, hostile world. But all the time her\nheart was crying, as if in the midst of some ordeal: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI want to go\nback, I want to go away, I want not to know it, not to know that this\nexists.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Yet she must go forward.\n\nUrsula could feel her suffering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou hate this, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt bewilders me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d stammered Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stay long,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Ursula.\n\nAnd Gudrun went along, grasping at release.\n\nThey drew away from the colliery region, over the curve of the hill,\ninto the purer country of the other side, towards Willey Green. Still\nthe faint glamour of blackness persisted over the fields and the wooded\nhills, and seemed darkly to gleam in the air. It was a spring day,\nchill, with snatches of sunshine. Yellow celandines showed out from the\nhedge-bottoms, and in the cottage gardens of Willey Green,\ncurrant-bushes were breaking into leaf, and little flowers were coming\nwhite on the grey alyssum that hung over the stone walls.\n\nTurning, they passed down the high-road, that went between high banks\ntowards the church. There, in the lowest bend of the road, low under\nthe trees, stood a little group of expectant people, waiting to see the\nwedding. The daughter of the chief mine-owner of the district, Thomas\nCrich, was getting married to a naval officer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet us go back,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, swerving away. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere are all those\npeople.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she hung wavering in the road.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNever mind them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all right. They all know me,\nthey don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut must we go through them?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re quite all right, really,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, going forward. And\ntogether the two sisters approached the group of uneasy, watchful\ncommon people. They were chiefly women, colliers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 wives of the more\nshiftless sort. They had watchful, underworld faces.\n\nThe two sisters held themselves tense, and went straight towards the\ngate. The women made way for them, but barely sufficient, as if\ngrudging to yield ground. The sisters passed in silence through the\nstone gateway and up the steps, on the red carpet, a policeman\nestimating their progress.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat price the stockings!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said a voice at the back of Gudrun. A\nsudden fierce anger swept over the girl, violent and murderous. She\nwould have liked them all annihilated, cleared away, so that the world\nwas left clear for her. How she hated walking up the churchyard path,\nalong the red carpet, continuing in motion, in their sight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go into the church,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said suddenly, with such final\ndecision that Ursula immediately halted, turned round, and branched off\nup a small side path which led to the little private gate of the\nGrammar School, whose grounds adjoined those of the church.\n\nJust inside the gate of the school shrubbery, outside the churchyard,\nUrsula sat down for a moment on the low stone wall under the laurel\nbushes, to rest. Behind her, the large red building of the school rose\nup peacefully, the windows all open for the holiday. Over the shrubs,\nbefore her, were the pale roofs and tower of the old church. The\nsisters were hidden by the foliage.\n\nGudrun sat down in silence. Her mouth was shut close, her face averted.\nShe was regretting bitterly that she had ever come back. Ursula looked\nat her, and thought how amazingly beautiful she was, flushed with\ndiscomfiture. But she caused a constraint over Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nature, a\ncertain weariness. Ursula wished to be alone, freed from the tightness,\nthe enclosure of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre we going to stay here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI was only resting a minute,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, getting up as if rebuked.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will stand in the corner by the fives-court, we shall see\neverything from there.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nFor the moment, the sunshine fell brightly into the churchyard, there\nwas a vague scent of sap and of spring, perhaps of violets from off the\ngraves. Some white daisies were out, bright as angels. In the air, the\nunfolding leaves of a copper-beech were blood-red.\n\nPunctually at eleven o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock, the carriages began to arrive. There was\na stir in the crowd at the gate, a concentration as a carriage drove\nup, wedding guests were mounting up the steps and passing along the red\ncarpet to the church. They were all gay and excited because the sun was\nshining.\n\nGudrun watched them closely, with objective curiosity. She saw each one\nas a complete figure, like a character in a book, or a subject in a\npicture, or a marionette in a theatre, a finished creation. She loved\nto recognise their various characteristics, to place them in their true\nlight, give them their own surroundings, settle them for ever as they\npassed before her along the path to the church. She knew them, they\nwere finished, sealed and stamped and finished with, for her. There was\nnone that had anything unknown, unresolved, until the Criches\nthemselves began to appear. Then her interest was piqued. Here was\nsomething not quite so preconcluded.\n\nThere came the mother, Mrs Crich, with her eldest son Gerald. She was a\nqueer unkempt figure, in spite of the attempts that had obviously been\nmade to bring her into line for the day. Her face was pale, yellowish,\nwith a clear, transparent skin, she leaned forward rather, her features\nwere strongly marked, handsome, with a tense, unseeing, predative look.\nHer colourless hair was untidy, wisps floating down on to her sac coat\nof dark blue silk, from under her blue silk hat. She looked like a\nwoman with a monomania, furtive almost, but heavily proud.\n\nHer son was of a fair, sun-tanned type, rather above middle height,\nwell-made, and almost exaggeratedly well-dressed. But about him also\nwas the strange, guarded look, the unconscious glisten, as if he did\nnot belong to the same creation as the people about him. Gudrun lighted\non him at once. There was something northern about him that magnetised\nher. In his clear northern flesh and his fair hair was a glisten like\nsunshine refracted through crystals of ice. And he looked so new,\nunbroached, pure as an arctic thing. Perhaps he was thirty years old,\nperhaps more. His gleaming beauty, maleness, like a young,\ngood-humoured, smiling wolf, did not blind her to the significant,\nsinister stillness in his bearing, the lurking danger of his unsubdued\ntemper. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHis totem is the wolf,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated to herself. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHis mother\nis an old, unbroken wolf.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And then she experienced a keen paroxyism, a\ntransport, as if she had made some incredible discovery, known to\nnobody else on earth. A strange transport took possession of her, all\nher veins were in a paroxysm of violent sensation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood God!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she\nexclaimed to herself, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat is this?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And then, a moment after, she was\nsaying assuredly, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall know more of that man.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She was tortured\nwith desire to see him again, a nostalgia, a necessity to see him\nagain, to make sure it was not all a mistake, that she was not deluding\nherself, that she really felt this strange and overwhelming sensation\non his account, this knowledge of him in her essence, this powerful\napprehension of him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAm I _really_ singled out for him in some way, is\nthere really some pale gold, arctic light that envelopes only us two?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe asked herself. And she could not believe it, she remained in a\nmuse, scarcely conscious of what was going on around.\n\nThe bridesmaids were here, and yet the bridegroom had not come. Ursula\nwondered if something was amiss, and if the wedding would yet all go\nwrong. She felt troubled, as if it rested upon her. The chief\nbridesmaids had arrived. Ursula watched them come up the steps. One of\nthem she knew, a tall, slow, reluctant woman with a weight of fair hair\nand a pale, long face. This was Hermione Roddice, a friend of the\nCriches. Now she came along, with her head held up, balancing an\nenormous flat hat of pale yellow velvet, on which were streaks of\nostrich feathers, natural and grey. She drifted forward as if scarcely\nconscious, her long blanched face lifted up, not to see the world. She\nwas rich. She wore a dress of silky, frail velvet, of pale yellow\ncolour, and she carried a lot of small rose-coloured cyclamens. Her\nshoes and stockings were of brownish grey, like the feathers on her\nhat, her hair was heavy, she drifted along with a peculiar fixity of\nthe hips, a strange unwilling motion. She was impressive, in her lovely\npale-yellow and brownish-rose, yet macabre, something repulsive. People\nwere silent when she passed, impressed, roused, wanting to jeer, yet\nfor some reason silenced. Her long, pale face, that she carried lifted\nup, somewhat in the Rossetti fashion, seemed almost drugged, as if a\nstrange mass of thoughts coiled in the darkness within her, and she was\nnever allowed to escape.\n\nUrsula watched her with fascination. She knew her a little. She was the\nmost remarkable woman in the Midlands. Her father was a Derbyshire\nBaronet of the old school, she was a woman of the new school, full of\nintellectuality, and heavy, nerve-worn with consciousness. She was\npassionately interested in reform, her soul was given up to the public\ncause. But she was a man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s woman, it was the manly world that held her.\n\nShe had various intimacies of mind and soul with various men of\ncapacity. Ursula knew, among these men, only Rupert Birkin, who was one\nof the school-inspectors of the county. But Gudrun had met others, in\nLondon. Moving with her artist friends in different kinds of society,\nGudrun had already come to know a good many people of repute and\nstanding. She had met Hermione twice, but they did not take to each\nother. It would be queer to meet again down here in the Midlands, where\ntheir social standing was so diverse, after they had known each other\non terms of equality in the houses of sundry acquaintances in town. For\nGudrun had been a social success, and had her friends among the slack\naristocracy that keeps touch with the arts.\n\nHermione knew herself to be well-dressed; she knew herself to be the\nsocial equal, if not far the superior, of anyone she was likely to meet\nin Willey Green. She knew she was accepted in the world of culture and\nof intellect. She was a _Kulturtr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ger_, a medium for the culture of\nideas. With all that was highest, whether in society or in thought or\nin public action, or even in art, she was at one, she moved among the\nforemost, at home with them. No one could put her down, no one could\nmake mock of her, because she stood among the first, and those that\nwere against her were below her, either in rank, or in wealth, or in\nhigh association of thought and progress and understanding. So, she was\ninvulnerable. All her life, she had sought to make herself\ninvulnerable, unassailable, beyond reach of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s judgment.\n\nAnd yet her soul was tortured, exposed. Even walking up the path to the\nchurch, confident as she was that in every respect she stood beyond all\nvulgar judgment, knowing perfectly that her appearance was complete and\nperfect, according to the first standards, yet she suffered a torture,\nunder her confidence and her pride, feeling herself exposed to wounds\nand to mockery and to despite. She always felt vulnerable, vulnerable,\nthere was always a secret chink in her armour. She did not know herself\nwhat it was. It was a lack of robust self, she had no natural\nsufficiency, there was a terrible void, a lack, a deficiency of being\nwithin her.\n\nAnd she wanted someone to close up this deficiency, to close it up for\never. She craved for Rupert Birkin. When he was there, she felt\ncomplete, she was sufficient, whole. For the rest of time she was\nestablished on the sand, built over a chasm, and, in spite of all her\nvanity and securities, any common maid-servant of positive, robust\ntemper could fling her down this bottomless pit of insufficiency, by\nthe slightest movement of jeering or contempt. And all the while the\npensive, tortured woman piled up her own defences of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6sthetic\nknowledge, and culture, and world-visions, and disinterestedness. Yet\nshe could never stop up the terrible gap of insufficiency.\n\nIf only Birkin would form a close and abiding connection with her, she\nwould be safe during this fretful voyage of life. He could make her\nsound and triumphant, triumphant over the very angels of heaven. If\nonly he would do it! But she was tortured with fear, with misgiving.\nShe made herself beautiful, she strove so hard to come to that degree\nof beauty and advantage, when he should be convinced. But always there\nwas a deficiency.\n\nHe was perverse too. He fought her off, he always fought her off. The\nmore she strove to bring him to her, the more he battled her back. And\nthey had been lovers now, for years. Oh, it was so wearying, so aching;\nshe was so tired. But still she believed in herself. She knew he was\ntrying to leave her. She knew he was trying to break away from her\nfinally, to be free. But still she believed in her strength to keep\nhim, she believed in her own higher knowledge. His own knowledge was\nhigh, she was the central touchstone of truth. She only needed his\nconjunction with her.\n\nAnd this, this conjunction with her, which was his highest fulfilment\nalso, with the perverseness of a wilful child he wanted to deny. With\nthe wilfulness of an obstinate child, he wanted to break the holy\nconnection that was between them.\n\nHe would be at this wedding; he was to be groom\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s man. He would be in\nthe church, waiting. He would know when she came. She shuddered with\nnervous apprehension and desire as she went through the church-door. He\nwould be there, surely he would see how beautiful her dress was, surely\nhe would see how she had made herself beautiful for him. He would\nunderstand, he would be able to see how she was made for him, the\nfirst, how she was, for him, the highest. Surely at last he would be\nable to accept his highest fate, he would not deny her.\n\nIn a little convulsion of too-tired yearning, she entered the church\nand looked slowly along her cheeks for him, her slender body convulsed\nwith agitation. As best man, he would be standing beside the altar. She\nlooked slowly, deferring in her certainty.\n\nAnd then, he was not there. A terrible storm came over her, as if she\nwere drowning. She was possessed by a devastating hopelessness. And she\napproached mechanically to the altar. Never had she known such a pang\nof utter and final hopelessness. It was beyond death, so utterly null,\ndesert.\n\nThe bridegroom and the groom\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s man had not yet come. There was a\ngrowing consternation outside. Ursula felt almost responsible. She\ncould not bear it that the bride should arrive, and no groom. The\nwedding must not be a fiasco, it must not.\n\nBut here was the bride\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s carriage, adorned with ribbons and cockades.\nGaily the grey horses curvetted to their destination at the\nchurch-gate, a laughter in the whole movement. Here was the quick of\nall laughter and pleasure. The door of the carriage was thrown open, to\nlet out the very blossom of the day. The people on the roadway murmured\nfaintly with the discontented murmuring of a crowd.\n\nThe father stepped out first into the air of the morning, like a\nshadow. He was a tall, thin, careworn man, with a thin black beard that\nwas touched with grey. He waited at the door of the carriage patiently,\nself-obliterated.\n\nIn the opening of the doorway was a shower of fine foliage and flowers,\na whiteness of satin and lace, and a sound of a gay voice saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do I get out?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA ripple of satisfaction ran through the expectant people. They pressed\nnear to receive her, looking with zest at the stooping blond head with\nits flower buds, and at the delicate, white, tentative foot that was\nreaching down to the step of the carriage. There was a sudden foaming\nrush, and the bride like a sudden surf-rush, floating all white beside\nher father in the morning shadow of trees, her veil flowing with\nlaughter.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s done it!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nShe put her hand on the arm of her care-worn, sallow father, and\nfrothing her light draperies, proceeded over the eternal red carpet.\nHer father, mute and yellowish, his black beard making him look more\ncareworn, mounted the steps stiffly, as if his spirit were absent; but\nthe laughing mist of the bride went along with him undiminished.\n\nAnd no bridegroom had arrived! It was intolerable for her. Ursula, her\nheart strained with anxiety, was watching the hill beyond; the white,\ndescending road, that should give sight of him. There was a carriage.\nIt was running. It had just come into sight. Yes, it was he. Ursula\nturned towards the bride and the people, and, from her place of\nvantage, gave an inarticulate cry. She wanted to warn them that he was\ncoming. But her cry was inarticulate and inaudible, and she flushed\ndeeply, between her desire and her wincing confusion.\n\nThe carriage rattled down the hill, and drew near. There was a shout\nfrom the people. The bride, who had just reached the top of the steps,\nturned round gaily to see what was the commotion. She saw a confusion\namong the people, a cab pulling up, and her lover dropping out of the\ncarriage, and dodging among the horses and into the crowd.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTibs! Tibs!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried in her sudden, mocking excitement, standing\nhigh on the path in the sunlight and waving her bouquet. He, dodging\nwith his hat in his hand, had not heard.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTibs!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried again, looking down to him.\n\nHe glanced up, unaware, and saw the bride and her father standing on\nthe path above him. A queer, startled look went over his face. He\nhesitated for a moment. Then he gathered himself together for a leap,\nto overtake her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh-h-h!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came her strange, intaken cry, as, on the reflex, she\nstarted, turned and fled, scudding with an unthinkable swift beating of\nher white feet and fraying of her white garments, towards the church.\nLike a hound the young man was after her, leaping the steps and\nswinging past her father, his supple haunches working like those of a\nhound that bears down on the quarry.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAy, after her!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the vulgar women below, carried suddenly into\nthe sport.\n\nShe, her flowers shaken from her like froth, was steadying herself to\nturn the angle of the church. She glanced behind, and with a wild cry\nof laughter and challenge, veered, poised, and was gone beyond the grey\nstone buttress. In another instant the bridegroom, bent forward as he\nran, had caught the angle of the silent stone with his hand, and had\nswung himself out of sight, his supple, strong loins vanishing in\npursuit.\n\nInstantly cries and exclamations of excitement burst from the crowd at\nthe gate. And then Ursula noticed again the dark, rather stooping\nfigure of Mr Crich, waiting suspended on the path, watching with\nexpressionless face the flight to the church. It was over, and he\nturned round to look behind him, at the figure of Rupert Birkin, who at\nonce came forward and joined him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll bring up the rear,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, a faint smile on his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAy!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the father laconically. And the two men turned together\nup the path.\n\nBirkin was as thin as Mr Crich, pale and ill-looking. His figure was\nnarrow but nicely made. He went with a slight trail of one foot, which\ncame only from self-consciousness. Although he was dressed correctly\nfor his part, yet there was an innate incongruity which caused a slight\nridiculousness in his appearance. His nature was clever and separate,\nhe did not fit at all in the conventional occasion. Yet he subordinated\nhimself to the common idea, travestied himself.\n\nHe affected to be quite ordinary, perfectly and marvellously\ncommonplace. And he did it so well, taking the tone of his\nsurroundings, adjusting himself quickly to his interlocutor and his\ncircumstance, that he achieved a verisimilitude of ordinary\ncommonplaceness that usually propitiated his onlookers for the moment,\ndisarmed them from attacking his singleness.\n\nNow he spoke quite easily and pleasantly to Mr Crich, as they walked\nalong the path; he played with situations like a man on a tight-rope:\nbut always on a tight-rope, pretending nothing but ease.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sorry we are so late,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he was saying. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t find a\nbutton-hook, so it took us a long time to button our boots. But you\nwere to the moment.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe are usually to time,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mr Crich.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m always late,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut today I was _really_ punctual,\nonly accidentally not so. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sorry.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe two men were gone, there was nothing more to see, for the time.\nUrsula was left thinking about Birkin. He piqued her, attracted her,\nand annoyed her.\n\nShe wanted to know him more. She had spoken with him once or twice, but\nonly in his official capacity as inspector. She thought he seemed to\nacknowledge some kinship between her and him, a natural, tacit\nunderstanding, a using of the same language. But there had been no time\nfor the understanding to develop. And something kept her from him, as\nwell as attracted her to him. There was a certain hostility, a hidden\nultimate reserve in him, cold and inaccessible.\n\nYet she wanted to know him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you think of Rupert Birkin?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, a little reluctantly,\nof Gudrun. She did not want to discuss him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do I think of Rupert Birkin?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nattractive\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094decidedly attractive. What I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stand about him is his\nway with other people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094his way of treating any little fool as if she\nwere his greatest consideration. One feels so awfully sold, oneself.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy does he do it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause he has no real critical faculty\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094of people, at all events,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nsaid Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI tell you, he treats any little fool as he treats me or\nyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s such an insult.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, it is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne must discriminate.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne _must_ discriminate,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a wonderful chap,\nin other respects\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a marvellous personality. But you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t trust him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula vaguely. She was always forced to assent to Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\npronouncements, even when she was not in accord altogether.\n\nThe sisters sat silent, waiting for the wedding party to come out.\nGudrun was impatient of talk. She wanted to think about Gerald Crich.\nShe wanted to see if the strong feeling she had got from him was real.\nShe wanted to have herself ready.\n\nInside the church, the wedding was going on. Hermione Roddice was\nthinking only of Birkin. He stood near her. She seemed to gravitate\nphysically towards him. She wanted to stand touching him. She could\nhardly be sure he was near her, if she did not touch him. Yet she stood\nsubjected through the wedding service.\n\nShe had suffered so bitterly when he did not come, that still she was\ndazed. Still she was gnawed as by a neuralgia, tormented by his\npotential absence from her. She had awaited him in a faint delirium of\nnervous torture. As she stood bearing herself pensively, the rapt look\non her face, that seemed spiritual, like the angels, but which came\nfrom torture, gave her a certain poignancy that tore his heart with\npity. He saw her bowed head, her rapt face, the face of an almost\ndemoniacal ecstatic. Feeling him looking, she lifted her face and\nsought his eyes, her own beautiful grey eyes flaring him a great\nsignal. But he avoided her look, she sank her head in torment and\nshame, the gnawing at her heart going on. And he too was tortured with\nshame, and ultimate dislike, and with acute pity for her, because he\ndid not want to meet her eyes, he did not want to receive her flare of\nrecognition.\n\nThe bride and bridegroom were married, the party went into the vestry.\nHermione crowded involuntarily up against Birkin, to touch him. And he\nendured it.\n\nOutside, Gudrun and Ursula listened for their father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s playing on the\norgan. He would enjoy playing a wedding march. Now the married pair\nwere coming! The bells were ringing, making the air shake. Ursula\nwondered if the trees and the flowers could feel the vibration, and\nwhat they thought of it, this strange motion in the air. The bride was\nquite demure on the arm of the bridegroom, who stared up into the sky\nbefore him, shutting and opening his eyes unconsciously, as if he were\nneither here nor there. He looked rather comical, blinking and trying\nto be in the scene, when emotionally he was violated by his exposure to\na crowd. He looked a typical naval officer, manly, and up to his duty.\n\nBirkin came with Hermione. She had a rapt, triumphant look, like the\nfallen angels restored, yet still subtly demoniacal, now she held\nBirkin by the arm. And he was expressionless, neutralised, possessed by\nher as if it were his fate, without question.\n\nGerald Crich came, fair, good-looking, healthy, with a great reserve of\nenergy. He was erect and complete, there was a strange stealth\nglistening through his amiable, almost happy appearance. Gudrun rose\nsharply and went away. She could not bear it. She wanted to be alone,\nto know this strange, sharp inoculation that had changed the whole\ntemper of her blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER II.\n\n\n SHORTLANDS\n\nThe Brangwens went home to Beldover, the wedding-party gathered at\nShortlands, the Criches\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 home. It was a long, low old house, a sort of\nmanor farm, that spread along the top of a slope just beyond the narrow\nlittle lake of Willey Water. Shortlands looked across a sloping meadow\nthat might be a park, because of the large, solitary trees that stood\nhere and there, across the water of the narrow lake, at the wooded hill\nthat successfully hid the colliery valley beyond, but did not quite\nhide the rising smoke. Nevertheless, the scene was rural and\npicturesque, very peaceful, and the house had a charm of its own.\n\nIt was crowded now with the family and the wedding guests. The father,\nwho was not well, withdrew to rest. Gerald was host. He stood in the\nhomely entrance hall, friendly and easy, attending to the men. He\nseemed to take pleasure in his social functions, he smiled, and was\nabundant in hospitality.\n\nThe women wandered about in a little confusion, chased hither and\nthither by the three married daughters of the house. All the while\nthere could be heard the characteristic, imperious voice of one Crich\nwoman or another calling \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHelen, come here a minute,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMarjory, I want\nyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094here.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I say, Mrs Witham\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d There was a great rustling of\nskirts, swift glimpses of smartly-dressed women, a child danced through\nthe hall and back again, a maidservant came and went hurriedly.\n\nMeanwhile the men stood in calm little groups, chatting, smoking,\npretending to pay no heed to the rustling animation of the women\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nworld. But they could not really talk, because of the glassy ravel of\nwomen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s excited, cold laughter and running voices. They waited, uneasy,\nsuspended, rather bored. But Gerald remained as if genial and happy,\nunaware that he was waiting or unoccupied, knowing himself the very\npivot of the occasion.\n\nSuddenly Mrs Crich came noiselessly into the room, peering about with\nher strong, clear face. She was still wearing her hat, and her sac coat\nof blue silk.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it, mother?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNothing, nothing!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she answered vaguely. And she went straight towards\nBirkin, who was talking to a Crich brother-in-law.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do, Mr Birkin,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her low voice, that seemed to\ntake no count of her guests. She held out her hand to him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh Mrs Crich,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Birkin, in his readily-changing voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\ncouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come to you before.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know half the people here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her low voice. Her\nson-in-law moved uneasily away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like strangers?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI myself can never see\nwhy one should take account of people, just because they happen to be\nin the room with one: why _should_ I know they are there?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy indeed, why indeed!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mrs Crich, in her low, tense voice.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExcept that they _are_ there. _I_ don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know people whom I find in the\nhouse. The children introduce them to me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Mother, this is Mr\nSo-and-so.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 I am no further. What has Mr So-and-so to do with his own\nname?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and what have I to do with either him or his name?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked up at Birkin. She startled him. He was flattered too that\nshe came to talk to him, for she took hardly any notice of anybody. He\nlooked down at her tense clear face, with its heavy features, but he\nwas afraid to look into her heavy-seeing blue eyes. He noticed instead\nhow her hair looped in slack, slovenly strands over her rather\nbeautiful ears, which were not quite clean. Neither was her neck\nperfectly clean. Even in that he seemed to belong to her, rather than\nto the rest of the company; though, he thought to himself, he was\nalways well washed, at any rate at the neck and ears.\n\nHe smiled faintly, thinking these things. Yet he was tense, feeling\nthat he and the elderly, estranged woman were conferring together like\ntraitors, like enemies within the camp of the other people. He\nresembled a deer, that throws one ear back upon the trail behind, and\none ear forward, to know what is ahead.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPeople don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really matter,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, rather unwilling to continue.\n\nThe mother looked up at him with sudden, dark interrogation, as if\ndoubting his sincerity.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you mean, _matter?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked sharply.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot many people are anything at all,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, forced to go deeper\nthan he wanted to. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey jingle and giggle. It would be much better if\nthey were just wiped out. Essentially, they don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t exist, they aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nthere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe watched him steadily while he spoke.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t imagine them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said sharply.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nothing to imagine, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s why they don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t exist.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI would hardly go as far as that. There they are,\nwhether they exist or no. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t rest with me to decide on their\nexistence. I only know that I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be expected to take count of them\nall. You can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t expect me to know them, just because they happen to be\nthere. As far as _I_ go they might as well not be there.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExactly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMightn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cJust as well,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he repeated. And there was a little pause.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExcept that they _are_ there, and that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a nuisance,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\nare my sons-in-law,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she went on, in a sort of monologue. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow Laura\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ngot married, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s another. And I really don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know John from James\nyet. They come up to me and call me mother. I know what they will\nsay\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098how are you, mother?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 I ought to say, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098I am not your mother, in\nany sense.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 But what is the use? There they are. I have had children of\nmy own. I suppose I know them from another woman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s children.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne would suppose so,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe looked at him, somewhat surprised, forgetting perhaps that she was\ntalking to him. And she lost her thread.\n\nShe looked round the room, vaguely. Birkin could not guess what she was\nlooking for, nor what she was thinking. Evidently she noticed her sons.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre my children all there?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him abruptly.\n\nHe laughed, startled, afraid perhaps.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI scarcely know them, except Gerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she exclaimed. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the most wanting of them all. You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d\nnever think it, to look at him now, would you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nThe mother looked across at her eldest son, stared at him heavily for\nsome time.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in an incomprehensible monosyllable, that sounded\nprofoundly cynical. Birkin felt afraid, as if he dared not realise. And\nMrs Crich moved away, forgetting him. But she returned on her traces.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI should like him to have a friend,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe has never had a\nfriend.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin looked down into her eyes, which were blue, and watching\nheavily. He could not understand them. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAm I my brother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s keeper?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\nsaid to himself, almost flippantly.\n\nThen he remembered, with a slight shock, that that was Cain\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cry. And\nGerald was Cain, if anybody. Not that he was Cain, either, although he\nhad slain his brother. There was such a thing as pure accident, and the\nconsequences did not attach to one, even though one had killed one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nbrother in such wise. Gerald as a boy had accidentally killed his\nbrother. What then? Why seek to draw a brand and a curse across the\nlife that had caused the accident? A man can live by accident, and die\nby accident. Or can he not? Is every man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s life subject to pure\naccident, is it only the race, the genus, the species, that has a\nuniversal reference? Or is this not true, is there no such thing as\npure accident? Has _everything_ that happens a universal significance?\nHas it? Birkin, pondering as he stood there, had forgotten Mrs Crich,\nas she had forgotten him.\n\nHe did not believe that there was any such thing as accident. It all\nhung together, in the deepest sense.\n\nJust as he had decided this, one of the Crich daughters came up,\nsaying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you come and take your hat off, mother dear? We shall be sitting\ndown to eat in a minute, and it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a formal occasion, darling, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nit?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She drew her arm through her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, and they went away. Birkin\nimmediately went to talk to the nearest man.\n\nThe gong sounded for the luncheon. The men looked up, but no move was\nmade to the dining-room. The women of the house seemed not to feel that\nthe sound had meaning for them. Five minutes passed by. The elderly\nmanservant, Crowther, appeared in the doorway exasperatedly. He looked\nwith appeal at Gerald. The latter took up a large, curved conch shell,\nthat lay on a shelf, and without reference to anybody, blew a\nshattering blast. It was a strange rousing noise, that made the heart\nbeat. The summons was almost magical. Everybody came running, as if at\na signal. And then the crowd in one impulse moved to the dining-room.\n\nGerald waited a moment, for his sister to play hostess. He knew his\nmother would pay no attention to her duties. But his sister merely\ncrowded to her seat. Therefore the young man, slightly too dictatorial,\ndirected the guests to their places.\n\nThere was a moment\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s lull, as everybody looked at the _hors d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099oeuvres_\nthat were being handed round. And out of this lull, a girl of thirteen\nor fourteen, with her long hair down her back, said in a calm,\nself-possessed voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald, you forget father, when you make that unearthly noise.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo I?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered. And then, to the company, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather is lying down,\nhe is not quite well.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow is he, really?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called one of the married daughters, peeping round\nthe immense wedding cake that towered up in the middle of the table\nshedding its artificial flowers.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe has no pain, but he feels tired,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Winifred, the girl with\nthe hair down her back.\n\nThe wine was filled, and everybody was talking boisterously. At the far\nend of the table sat the mother, with her loosely-looped hair. She had\nBirkin for a neighbour. Sometimes she glanced fiercely down the rows of\nfaces, bending forwards and staring unceremoniously. And she would say\nin a low voice to Birkin:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho is that young man?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Birkin answered discreetly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave I seen him before?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think so. _I_ haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. And she was satisfied. Her\neyes closed wearily, a peace came over her face, she looked like a\nqueen in repose. Then she started, a little social smile came on her\nface, for a moment she looked the pleasant hostess. For a moment she\nbent graciously, as if everyone were welcome and delightful. And then\nimmediately the shadow came back, a sullen, eagle look was on her face,\nshe glanced from under her brows like a sinister creature at bay,\nhating them all.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called Diana, a handsome girl a little older than Winifred,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI may have wine, mayn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t I?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, you may have wine,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the mother automatically, for she was\nperfectly indifferent to the question.\n\nAnd Diana beckoned to the footman to fill her glass.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t forbid me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said calmly, to the company at large.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll right, Di,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said her brother amiably. And she glanced challenge at\nhim as she drank from her glass.\n\nThere was a strange freedom, that almost amounted to anarchy, in the\nhouse. It was rather a resistance to authority, than liberty. Gerald\nhad some command, by mere force of personality, not because of any\ngranted position. There was a quality in his voice, amiable but\ndominant, that cowed the others, who were all younger than he.\n\nHermione was having a discussion with the bridegroom about nationality.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think that the appeal to patriotism is a mistake. It\nis like one house of business rivalling another house of business.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell you can hardly say that, can you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Gerald, who had a\nreal _passion_ for discussion. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t call a race a business\nconcern, could you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and nationality roughly corresponds to race, I\nthink.

Then she\nsaid with strange assumption of authority:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, but even so, is the patriotic appeal an appeal to the racial\ninstinct? Is it not rather an appeal to the proprietory instinct, the\n_commercial_ instinct? And isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t this what we mean by nationality?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cProbably,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, who felt that such a discussion was out of\nplace and out of time.\n\nBut Gerald was now on the scent of argument.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA race may have its commercial aspect,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn fact it must.

There was a lawn, and flower-beds, and at the boundary an iron\nfence shutting off the little field or park. The view was pleasant; a\nhighroad curving round the edge of a low lake, under the trees. In the\nspring air, the water gleamed and the opposite woods were purplish with\nnew life. Charming Jersey cattle came to the fence, breathing hoarsely\nfrom their velvet muzzles at the human beings, expecting perhaps a\ncrust.\n\nBirkin leaned on the fence.

It was always the same between them; always their talk\nbrought them into a deadly nearness of contact, a strange, perilous\nintimacy which was either hate or love, or both. They parted with\napparent unconcern, as if their going apart were a trivial occurrence.\nAnd they really kept it to the level of trivial occurrence. Yet the\nheart of each burned from the other. They burned with each other,\ninwardly. This they would never admit. They intended to keep their\nrelationship a casual free-and-easy friendship, they were not going to\nbe so unmanly and unnatural as to allow any heart-burning between them.\nThey had not the faintest belief in deep relationship between men and\nmen, and their disbelief prevented any development of their powerful\nbut suppressed friendliness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER III.\n\n\n CLASS-ROOM\n\nA school-day was drawing to a close. In the class-room the last lesson\nwas in progress, peaceful and still. It was elementary botany. The\ndesks were littered with catkins, hazel and willow, which the children\nhad been sketching. But the sky had come overdark, as the end of the\nafternoon approached: there was scarcely light to draw any more. Ursula\nstood in front of the class, leading the children by questions to\nunderstand the structure and the meaning of the catkins.\n\nA heavy, copper-coloured beam of light came in at the west window,\ngilding the outlines of the children\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heads with red gold, and falling\non the wall opposite in a rich, ruddy illumination. Ursula, however,\nwas scarcely conscious of it. She was busy, the end of the day was\nhere, the work went on as a peaceful tide that is at flood, hushed to\nretire.\n\nThis day had gone by like so many more, in an activity that was like a\ntrance. At the end there was a little haste, to finish what was in\nhand. She was pressing the children with questions, so that they should\nknow all they were to know, by the time the gong went. She stood in\nshadow in front of the class, with catkins in her hand, and she leaned\ntowards the children, absorbed in the passion of instruction.\n\nShe heard, but did not notice the click of the door. Suddenly she\nstarted. She saw, in the shaft of ruddy, copper-coloured light near\nher, the face of a man. It was gleaming like fire, watching her,\nwaiting for her to be aware. It startled her terribly. She thought she\nwas going to faint. All her suppressed, subconscious fear sprang into\nbeing, with anguish.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid I startle you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, shaking hands with her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI thought\nyou had heard me come in.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she faltered, scarcely able to speak. He laughed, saying he was\nsorry. She wondered why it amused him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is so dark,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we have the light?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd moving aside, he switched on the strong electric lights. The\nclass-room was distinct and hard, a strange place after the soft dim\nmagic that filled it before he came. Birkin turned curiously to look at\nUrsula. Her eyes were round and wondering, bewildered, her mouth\nquivered slightly. She looked like one who is suddenly wakened. There\nwas a living, tender beauty, like a tender light of dawn shining from\nher face.

Ursula\nwatched his intent progress. There was a stillness in his motion that\nhushed the activities of her heart. She seemed to be standing aside in\narrested silence, watching him move in another, concentrated world. His\npresence was so quiet, almost like a vacancy in the corporate air.\n\nSuddenly he lifted his face to her, and her heart quickened at the\nflicker of his voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGive them some crayons, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cso that they can make\nthe gynaecious flowers red, and the androgynous yellow.

And then only she turned to Ursula, who, with all\nthe class, had been watching the little scene between the lovers.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do, Miss Brangwen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, in her low, odd, singing\nfashion, that sounded almost as if she were poking fun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you mind my\ncoming in?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer grey, almost sardonic eyes rested all the while on Ursula, as if\nsumming her up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you _sure?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Hermione, with complete _sang-froid_, and an\nodd, half-bullying effrontery.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no, I like it awfully,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Ursula, a little bit excited and\nbewildered, because Hermione seemed to be compelling her, coming very\nclose to her, as if intimate with her; and yet, how could she be\nintimate?\n\nThis was the answer Hermione wanted. She turned satisfied to Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are you doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she sang, in her casual, inquisitive fashion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCatkins,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd what do you learn about them?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She spoke all\nthe while in a mocking, half teasing fashion, as if making game of the\nwhole business.

The high\ncollar, and the inside of the cloak, was lined with dark fur. Beneath\nshe had a dress of fine lavender-coloured cloth, trimmed with fur, and\nher hat was close-fitting, made of fur and of the dull, green-and-gold\nfigured stuff. She was tall and strange, she looked as if she had come\nout of some new, bizarre picture.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you know the little red ovary flowers, that produce the nuts?

Both Birkin and Ursula\nwere suspended. The little red pistillate flowers had some strange,\nalmost mystic-passionate attraction for her.\n\nThe lesson was finished, the books were put away, at last the class was\ndismissed. And still Hermione sat at the table, with her chin in her\nhand, her elbow on the table, her long white face pushed up, not\nattending to anything. Birkin had gone to the window, and was looking\nfrom the brilliantly-lighted room on to the grey, colourless outside,\nwhere rain was noiselessly falling. Ursula put away her things in the\ncupboard.\n\nAt length Hermione rose and came near to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYour sister has come home?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd does she like being back in Beldover?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I wonder she can bear it.

She paused, watching him all the while, her eyes\nvague. Then she wiped her fingers across her brow, with a vague\nweariness. It irritated him bitterly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is the mind,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand\nthat is death.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She raised her eyes slowly to him: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the mind\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe said, with the convulsed movement of her body, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cisn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it our death?\nDoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it destroy all our spontaneity, all our instincts?

Even your animalism, you want it in your head. You don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to\n_be_ an animal, you want to observe your own animal functions, to get a\nmental thrill out of them. It is all purely secondary\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and more decadent\nthan the most hide-bound intellectualism. What is it but the worst and\nlast form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and the\nanimal instincts? Passion and the instincts\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you want them hard enough,\nbut through your head, in your consciousness. It all takes place in\nyour head, under that skull of yours.

There, in the mirror, you must have everything. But now you\nhave come to all your conclusions, you want to go back and be like a\nsavage, without knowledge. You want a life of pure sensation and\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098passion.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe quoted the last word satirically against her.

It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s your bullying will. You want to clutch\nthings and have them in your power. You want to have things in your\npower. And why? Because you haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t got any real body, any dark sensual\nbody of life. You have no sensuality. You have only your will and your\nconceit of consciousness, and your lust for power, to _know_.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at her in mingled hate and contempt, also in pain because she\nsuffered, and in shame because he knew he tortured her. He had an\nimpulse to kneel and plead for forgiveness. But a bitterer red anger\nburned up to fury in him. He became unconscious of her, he was only a\npassionate voice speaking.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSpontaneous!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou and spontaneity!

Because you want to have everything in your own\nvolition, your deliberate voluntary consciousness. You want it all in\nthat loathsome little skull of yours, that ought to be cracked like a\nnut. For you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be the same till it is cracked, like an insect in its\nskin. If one cracked your skull perhaps one might get a spontaneous,\npassionate woman out of you, with real sensuality. As it is, what you\nwant is pornography\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094looking at yourself in mirrors, watching your naked\nanimal actions in mirrors, so that you can have it all in your\nconsciousness, make it all mental.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a sense of violation in the air, as if too much was said, the\nunforgivable. Yet Ursula was concerned now only with solving her own\nproblems, in the light of his words. She was pale and abstracted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut do you really _want_ sensuality?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, puzzled.\n\nBirkin looked at her, and became intent in his explanation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat and nothing else, at this point.

She turned with a pleasant intimacy to Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are sure you will come to Breadalby?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, urging.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I should like to very much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Ursula.\n\nHermione looked down at her, gratified, reflecting, and strangely\nabsent, as if possessed, as if not quite there.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so glad,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, pulling herself together. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSome time in about\na fortnight. Yes? I will write to you here, at the school, shall I?\nYes. And you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be sure to come? Yes. I shall be so glad. Good-bye!\nGood-bye!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione held out her hand and looked into the eyes of the other woman.\nShe knew Ursula as an immediate rival, and the knowledge strangely\nexhilarated her. Also she was taking leave. It always gave her a sense\nof strength, advantage, to be departing and leaving the other behind.\nMoreover she was taking the man with her, if only in hate.\n\nBirkin stood aside, fixed and unreal. But now, when it was his turn to\nbid good-bye, he began to speak again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the whole difference in the world,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbetween the\nactual sensual being, and the vicious mental-deliberate profligacy our\nlot goes in for.

You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got to do\nit. You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got to learn not-to-be, before you can come into being.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we have got such a conceit of ourselves\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s where it is. We are\nso conceited, and so unproud. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got no pride, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all conceit, so\nconceited in our own papier-mach\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 realised selves. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d rather die than\ngive up our little self-righteous self-opinionated self-will.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was silence in the room. Both women were hostile and resentful.\nHe sounded as if he were addressing a meeting. Hermione merely paid no\nattention, stood with her shoulders tight in a shrug of dislike.\n\nUrsula was watching him as if furtively, not really aware of what she\nwas seeing. There was a great physical attractiveness in him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a curious\nhidden richness, that came through his thinness and his pallor like\nanother voice, conveying another knowledge of him. It was in the curves\nof his brows and his chin, rich, fine, exquisite curves, the powerful\nbeauty of life itself. She could not say what it was. But there was a\nsense of richness and of liberty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we are sensual enough, without making ourselves so, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe asked, turning to him with a certain golden laughter flickering\nunder her greenish eyes, like a challenge. And immediately the queer,\ncareless, terribly attractive smile came over his eyes and brows,\nthough his mouth did not relax.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.

A spasm of anger and chagrin went over Ursula.\nHis face set. And he bade good-bye, as if he had ceased to notice her.\n\nThey were gone. Ursula stood looking at the door for some moments. Then\nshe put out the lights. And having done so, she sat down again in her\nchair, absorbed and lost. And then she began to cry, bitterly, bitterly\nweeping: but whether for misery or joy, she never knew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER IV.\n\n\n DIVER\n\nThe week passed away. On the Saturday it rained, a soft drizzling rain\nthat held off at times. In one of the intervals Gudrun and Ursula set\nout for a walk, going towards Willey Water. The atmosphere was grey and\ntranslucent, the birds sang sharply on the young twigs, the earth would\nbe quickening and hastening in growth. The two girls walked swiftly,\ngladly, because of the soft, subtle rush of morning that filled the wet\nhaze. By the road the black-thorn was in blossom, white and wet, its\ntiny amber grains burning faintly in the white smoke of blossom. Purple\ntwigs were darkly luminous in the grey air, high hedges glowed like\nliving shadows, hovering nearer, coming into creation. The morning was\nfull of a new creation.\n\nWhen the sisters came to Willey Water, the lake lay all grey and\nvisionary, stretching into the moist, translucent vista of trees and\nmeadow. Fine electric activity in sound came from the dumbles below the\nroad, the birds piping one against the other, and water mysteriously\nplashing, issuing from the lake.\n\nThe two girls drifted swiftly along. In front of them, at the corner of\nthe lake, near the road, was a mossy boat-house under a walnut tree,\nand a little landing-stage where a boat was moored, wavering like a\nshadow on the still grey water, below the green, decayed poles. All was\nshadowy with coming summer.\n\nSuddenly, from the boat-house, a white figure ran out, frightening in\nits swift sharp transit, across the old landing-stage. It launched in a\nwhite arc through the air, there was a bursting of the water, and among\nthe smooth ripples a swimmer was making out to space, in a centre of\nfaintly heaving motion. The whole otherworld, wet and remote, he had to\nhimself. He could move into the pure translucency of the grey,\nuncreated water.\n\nGudrun stood by the stone wall, watching.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow I envy him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in low, desirous tones.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUgh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d shivered Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo cold!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, but how good, how really fine, to swim out there!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The sisters\nstood watching the swimmer move further into the grey, moist, full\nspace of the water, pulsing with his own small, invading motion, and\narched over with mist and dim woods.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you wish it were you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun, looking at Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI do,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not sure\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s so wet.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, reluctantly. She stood watching the motion on the\nbosom of the water, as if fascinated. He, having swum a certain\ndistance, turned round and was swimming on his back, looking along the\nwater at the two girls by the wall. In the faint wash of motion, they\ncould see his ruddy face, and could feel him watching them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is Gerald Crich,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gudrun.\n\nAnd she stood motionless gazing over the water at the face which washed\nup and down on the flood, as he swam steadily. From his separate\nelement he saw them and he exulted to himself because of his own\nadvantage, his possession of a world to himself. He was immune and\nperfect. He loved his own vigorous, thrusting motion, and the violent\nimpulse of the very cold water against his limbs, buoying him up. He\ncould see the girls watching him a way off, outside, and that pleased\nhim. He lifted his arm from the water, in a sign to them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is waving,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gudrun. They watched him. He waved again, with a strange\nmovement of recognition across the difference.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLike a Nibelung,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Ursula. Gudrun said nothing, only stood\nstill looking over the water.\n\nGerald suddenly turned, and was swimming away swiftly, with a side\nstroke. He was alone now, alone and immune in the middle of the waters,\nwhich he had all to himself. He exulted in his isolation in the new\nelement, unquestioned and unconditioned. He was happy, thrusting with\nhis legs and all his body, without bond or connection anywhere, just\nhimself in the watery world.\n\nGudrun envied him almost painfully. Even this momentary possession of\npure isolation and fluidity seemed to her so terribly desirable that\nshe felt herself as if damned, out there on the high-road.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod, what it is to be a man!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Ursula in surprise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe freedom, the liberty, the mobility!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, strangely\nflushed and brilliant. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re a man, you want to do a thing, you do\nit.

It is impossible, it is one of\nthe impossibilities of life, for me to take my clothes off now and jump\nin.

They were passing between the\ntrees just below Shortlands. They looked up at the long, low house, dim\nand glamorous in the wet morning, its cedar trees slanting before the\nwindows. Gudrun seemed to be studying it closely.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s attractive, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery peaceful and charming.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt has form, too\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it has a period.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat period?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, eighteenth century, for certain; Dorothy Wordsworth and Jane\nAusten, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think so?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps.

Ursula often wondered what else she waited for,\nbesides the beginning and end of the school week, and the beginning and\nend of the holidays. This was a whole life! Sometimes she had periods\nof tight horror, when it seemed to her that her life would pass away,\nand be gone, without having been more than this. But she never really\naccepted it. Her spirit was active, her life like a shoot that is\ngrowing steadily, but which has not yet come above ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER V.\n\n\n IN THE TRAIN\n\nOne day at this time Birkin was called to London. He was not very fixed\nin his abode. He had rooms in Nottingham, because his work lay chiefly\nin that town. But often he was in London, or in Oxford. He moved about\na great deal, his life seemed uncertain, without any definite rhythm,\nany organic meaning.\n\nOn the platform of the railway station he saw Gerald Crich, reading a\nnewspaper, and evidently waiting for the train. Birkin stood some\ndistance off, among the people. It was against his instinct to approach\nanybody.\n\nFrom time to time, in a manner characteristic of him, Gerald lifted his\nhead and looked round. Even though he was reading the newspaper\nclosely, he must keep a watchful eye on his external surroundings.\nThere seemed to be a dual consciousness running in him. He was thinking\nvigorously of something he read in the newspaper, and at the same time\nhis eye ran over the surfaces of the life round him, and he missed\nnothing. Birkin, who was watching him, was irritated by his duality. He\nnoticed too, that Gerald seemed always to be at bay against everybody,\nin spite of his queer, genial, social manner when roused.\n\nNow Birkin started violently at seeing this genial look flash on to\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, at seeing Gerald approaching with hand outstretched.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHallo, Rupert, where are you going?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLondon.

Until then, any sort of\nproposal, or making proposals, is no more than a tiresome game for\nself-important people.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe little smile began to die out of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes, and he said,\nlooking with a cool stare at Birkin:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo you really think things are very bad?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCompletely bad.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe smile appeared again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn what way?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cEvery way,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe are such dreary liars. Our one idea is to\nlie to ourselves. We have an ideal of a perfect world, clean and\nstraight and sufficient. So we cover the earth with foulness; life is a\nblotch of labour, like insects scurrying in filth, so that your collier\ncan have a pianoforte in his parlour, and you can have a butler and a\nmotor-car in your up-to-date house, and as a nation we can sport the\nRitz, or the Empire, Gaby Deslys and the Sunday newspapers. It is very\ndreary.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald took a little time to re-adjust himself after this tirade.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWould you have us live without houses\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094return to nature?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI would have nothing at all. People only do what they want to do\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and\nwhat they are capable of doing. If they were capable of anything else,\nthere would be something else.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain Gerald pondered.

Amazing heights of upright grandeur. It\nmakes him so much higher in his neighbouring collier\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes. He sees\nhimself reflected in the neighbouring opinion, like in a Brocken mist,\nseveral feet taller on the strength of the pianoforte, and he is\nsatisfied.

And he turned to look out of\nthe window at the flying, golden landscape.\n\nBirkin could not help seeing how beautiful and soldierly his face was,\nwith a certain courage to be indifferent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think its heavy odds against us?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got to make our life up out of a woman, one woman, woman\nonly, yes, I do,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe I shall ever make up\n_my_ life, at that rate.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin watched him almost angrily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are a born unbeliever,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI only feel what I feel,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. And he looked again at Birkin\nalmost sardonically, with his blue, manly, sharp-lighted eyes. Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\neyes were at the moment full of anger. But swiftly they became\ntroubled, doubtful, then full of a warm, rich affectionateness and\nlaughter.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt troubles me very much, Gerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, wrinkling his brows.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can see it does,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, uncovering his mouth in a manly,\nquick, soldierly laugh.\n\nGerald was held unconsciously by the other man. He wanted to be near\nhim, he wanted to be within his sphere of influence. There was\nsomething very congenial to him in Birkin. But yet, beyond this, he did\nnot take much notice. He felt that he, himself, Gerald, had harder and\nmore durable truths than any the other man knew. He felt himself older,\nmore knowing. It was the quick-changing warmth and venality and\nbrilliant warm utterance he loved in his friend. It was the rich play\nof words and quick interchange of feelings he enjoyed. The real content\nof the words he never really considered: he himself knew better.\n\nBirkin knew this. He knew that Gerald wanted to be _fond_ of him\nwithout taking him seriously. And this made him go hard and cold. As\nthe train ran on, he sat looking at the land, and Gerald fell away,\nbecame as nothing to him.\n\nBirkin looked at the land, at the evening, and was thinking: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, if\nmankind is destroyed, if our race is destroyed like Sodom, and there is\nthis beautiful evening with the luminous land and trees, I am\nsatisfied. That which informs it all is there, and can never be lost.\nAfter all, what is mankind but just one expression of the\nincomprehensible. And if mankind passes away, it will only mean that\nthis particular expression is completed and done. That which is\nexpressed, and that which is to be expressed, cannot be diminished.\nThere it is, in the shining evening. Let mankind pass away\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094time it did.\nThe creative utterances will not cease, they will only be there.\nHumanity doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t embody the utterance of the incomprehensible any more.\nHumanity is a dead letter. There will be a new embodiment, in a new\nway. Let humanity disappear as quick as possible.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald interrupted him by asking,\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are you staying in London?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin looked up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWith a man in Soho.

He saw too how good-looking he was.\nGerald was attractive, his blood seemed fluid and electric. His blue\neyes burned with a keen, yet cold light, there was a certain beauty, a\nbeautiful passivity in all his body, his moulding.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe might see something of each other\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I am in London for two or three\ndays,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to go to the theatre, or the music\nhall\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better come round to the flat, and see what you can make of\nHalliday and his crowd.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThanks\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I should like to,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are you doing\ntonight?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI promised to meet Halliday at the Pompadour.

They had passed Bedford. Birkin watched the\ncountry, and was filled with a sort of hopelessness. He always felt\nthis, on approaching London.\n\nHis dislike of mankind, of the mass of mankind, amounted almost to an\nillness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Where the quiet coloured end of evening smiles\nMiles and miles\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nhe was murmuring to himself, like a man condemned to death.

And he watched the other man critically.\n\nIn a few minutes the train was running through the disgrace of\noutspread London. Everybody in the carriage was on the alert, waiting\nto escape. At last they were under the huge arch of the station, in the\ntremendous shadow of the town. Birkin shut himself together\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was in\nnow.\n\nThe two men went together in a taxi-cab.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you feel like one of the damned?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin, as they sat in a\nlittle, swiftly-running enclosure, and watched the hideous great\nstreet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is real death,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER VI.\n\n\n CR\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0088ME DE MENTHE\n\nThey met again in the caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 several hours later. Gerald went through the\npush doors into the large, lofty room where the faces and heads of the\ndrinkers showed dimly through the haze of smoke, reflected more dimly,\nand repeated ad infinitum in the great mirrors on the walls, so that\none seemed to enter a vague, dim world of shadowy drinkers humming\nwithin an atmosphere of blue tobacco smoke. There was, however, the red\nplush of the seats to give substance within the bubble of pleasure.\n\nGerald moved in his slow, observant, glistening-attentive motion down\nbetween the tables and the people whose shadowy faces looked up as he\npassed. He seemed to be entering in some strange element, passing into\nan illuminated new region, among a host of licentious souls. He was\npleased, and entertained. He looked over all the dim, evanescent,\nstrangely illuminated faces that bent across the tables. Then he saw\nBirkin rise and signal to him.\n\nAt Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s table was a girl with dark, soft, fluffy hair cut short in\nthe artist fashion, hanging level and full almost like the Egyptian\nprincess\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. She was small and delicately made, with warm colouring and\nlarge, dark hostile eyes. There was a delicacy, almost a beauty in all\nher form, and at the same time a certain attractive grossness of\nspirit, that made a little spark leap instantly alight in Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\neyes.\n\nBirkin, who looked muted, unreal, his presence left out, introduced her\nas Miss Darrington. She gave her hand with a sudden, unwilling\nmovement, looking all the while at Gerald with a dark, exposed stare. A\nglow came over him as he sat down.\n\nThe waiter appeared.

He laughed,\nhearing himself described. He felt proud too, full of male strength.\nHis blue, keen eyes were lit up with laughter, his ruddy face, with its\nsharp fair hair, was full of satisfaction, and glowing with life. He\npiqued her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow long are you staying?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA day or two,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut there is no particular hurry.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nStill she stared into his face with that slow, full gaze which was so\ncurious and so exciting to him. He was acutely and delightfully\nconscious of himself, of his own attractiveness. He felt full of\nstrength, able to give off a sort of electric power. And he was aware\nof her dark, hot-looking eyes upon him. She had beautiful eyes, dark,\nfully-opened, hot, naked in their looking at him. And on them there\nseemed to float a film of disintegration, a sort of misery and\nsullenness, like oil on water. She wore no hat in the heated caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9, her\nloose, simple jumper was strung on a string round her neck. But it was\nmade of rich peach-coloured cr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aape-de-chine, that hung heavily and\nsoftly from her young throat and her slender wrists. Her appearance was\nsimple and complete, really beautiful, because of her regularity and\nform, her soft dark hair falling full and level on either side of her\nhead, her straight, small, softened features, Egyptian in the slight\nfulness of their curves, her slender neck and the simple, rich-coloured\nsmock hanging on her slender shoulders. She was very still, almost\nnull, in her manner, apart and watchful.\n\nShe appealed to Gerald strongly. He felt an awful, enjoyable power over\nher, an instinctive cherishing very near to cruelty. For she was a\nvictim. He felt that she was in his power, and he was generous. The\nelectricity was turgid and voluptuously rich, in his limbs. He would be\nable to destroy her utterly in the strength of his discharge. But she\nwas waiting in her separation, given.\n\nThey talked banalities for some time. Suddenly Birkin said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Julius!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d and he half rose to his feet, motioning to the\nnewcomer. The girl, with a curious, almost evil motion, looked round\nover her shoulder without moving her body. Gerald watched her dark,\nsoft hair swing over her ears. He felt her watching intensely the man\nwho was approaching, so he looked too. He saw a pale, full-built young\nman with rather long, solid fair hair hanging from under his black hat,\nmoving cumbrously down the room, his face lit up with a smile at once\nnaive and warm, and vapid. He approached towards Birkin, with a haste\nof welcome.\n\nIt was not till he was quite close that he perceived the girl. He\nrecoiled, went pale, and said, in a high squealing voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPussum, what are _you_ doing here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 looked up like animals when they hear a cry. Halliday hung\nmotionless, an almost imbecile smile flickering palely on his face. The\ngirl only stared at him with a black look in which flared an\nunfathomable hell of knowledge, and a certain impotence.

She wanted to know.\nAnd her dark eyes seemed to be looking through into his naked organism.\nHe felt, she was compelled to him, she was fated to come into contact\nwith him, must have the seeing him and knowing him. And this roused a\ncurious exultance. Also he felt, she must relinquish herself into his\nhands, and be subject to him. She was so profane, slave-like, watching\nhim, absorbed by him. It was not that she was interested in what he\nsaid; she was absorbed by his self-revelation, by _him_, she wanted the\nsecret of him, the experience of his male being.\n\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face was lit up with an uncanny smile, full of light and\nrousedness, yet unconscious.

And she knew, she watched her own fascination.\n\nOther men had come to the table, to talk with Birkin and Halliday.\nGerald said in a low voice, apart, to Pussum:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere have you come back from?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFrom the country,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Pussum, in a very low, yet fully resonant\nvoice. Her face closed hard. Continually she glanced at Halliday, and\nthen a black flare came over her eyes. The heavy, fair young man\nignored her completely; he was really afraid of her. For some moments\nshe would be unaware of Gerald. He had not conquered her yet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd what has Halliday to do with it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, his voice still muted.\n\nShe would not answer for some seconds.

Gerald thought him a\nstrange fool, and yet piquant.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut Pussum,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said another man, in a very small, quick Eton voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\npromised not to hurt him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurt him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she answered.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat will you drink?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d the young man asked.

She was delicate and finicking\nin her eating, her fingers were fine and seemed very sensitive in the\ntips, so she put her food apart with fine, small motions, she ate\ncarefully, delicately. It pleased him very much to see her, and it\nirritated Birkin. They were all drinking champagne. Maxim, the prim\nyoung Russian with the smooth, warm-coloured face and black, oiled hair\nwas the only one who seemed to be perfectly calm and sober. Birkin was\nwhite and abstract, unnatural, Gerald was smiling with a constant\nbright, amused, cold light in his eyes, leaning a little protectively\ntowards the Pussum, who was very handsome, and soft, unfolded like some\nred lotus in dreadful flowering nakedness, vainglorious now, flushed\nwith wine and with the excitement of men. Halliday looked foolish. One\nglass of wine was enough to make him drunk and giggling.

He laughed\ndangerously, from the blood. Her childish speech caressed his nerves,\nand her burning, filmed eyes, turned now full upon him, oblivious of\nall her antecedents, gave him a sort of licence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she protested. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not afraid of other things.

Two little\npoints of light glinted on Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do they call you Pussum, because you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re like a cat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI expect so,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nThe smile grew more intense on his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are, rather; or a young, female panther.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh God, Gerald!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, in some disgust.\n\nThey both looked uneasily at Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re silent tonight, Wupert,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to him, with a slight\ninsolence, being safe with the other man.\n\nHalliday was coming back, looking forlorn and sick.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPussum,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wish you wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do these things\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He sank in\nhis chair with a groan.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better go home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI _will_ go home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you all come along.

Oh, how awful! Libidnikov, do let us go.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s only drunk one glass\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094only one glass,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the rapid, hushed\nvoice of the young Russian.\n\nThey all moved off to the door. The girl kept near to Gerald, and\nseemed to be at one in her motion with him. He was aware of this, and\nfilled with demon-satisfaction that his motion held good for two. He\nheld her in the hollow of his will, and she was soft, secret, invisible\nin her stirring there.\n\nThey crowded five of them into the taxi-cab. Halliday lurched in first,\nand dropped into his seat against the other window. Then the Pussum\ntook her place, and Gerald sat next to her. They heard the young\nRussian giving orders to the driver, then they were all seated in the\ndark, crowded close together, Halliday groaning and leaning out of the\nwindow. They felt the swift, muffled motion of the car.\n\nThe Pussum sat near to Gerald, and she seemed to become soft, subtly to\ninfuse herself into his bones, as if she were passing into him in a\nblack, electric flow. Her being suffused into his veins like a magnetic\ndarkness, and concentrated at the base of his spine like a fearful\nsource of power. Meanwhile her voice sounded out reedy and nonchalant,\nas she talked indifferently with Birkin and with Maxim. Between her and\nGerald was this silence and this black, electric comprehension in the\ndarkness. Then she found his hand, and grasped it in her own firm,\nsmall clasp. It was so utterly dark, and yet such a naked statement,\nthat rapid vibrations ran through his blood and over his brain, he was\nno longer responsible. Still her voice rang on like a bell, tinged with\na tone of mockery. And as she swung her head, her fine mane of hair\njust swept his face, and all his nerves were on fire, as with a subtle\nfriction of electricity. But the great centre of his force held steady,\na magnificent pride to him, at the base of his spine.\n\nThey arrived at a large block of buildings, went up in a lift, and\npresently a door was being opened for them by a Hindu. Gerald looked in\nsurprise, wondering if he were a gentleman, one of the Hindus down from\nOxford, perhaps. But no, he was the man-servant.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMake tea, Hasan,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Halliday.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is a room for me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nTo both of which questions the man grinned, and murmured.\n\nHe made Gerald uncertain, because, being tall and slender and reticent,\nhe looked like a gentleman.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho is your servant?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked of Halliday. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe looks a swell.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s because he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dressed in another man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s clothes. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nanything but a swell, really. We found him in the road, starving. So I\ntook him here, and another man gave him clothes. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s anything but what\nhe seems to be\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094his only advantage is that he can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t speak English and\ncan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t understand it, so he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s perfectly safe.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s very dirty,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the young Russian swiftly and silently.\n\nDirectly, the man appeared in the doorway.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Halliday.\n\nThe Hindu grinned, and murmured shyly:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWant to speak to master.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald watched curiously. The fellow in the doorway was goodlooking and\nclean-limbed, his bearing was calm, he looked elegant, aristocratic.\nYet he was half a savage, grinning foolishly. Halliday went out into\nthe corridor to speak with him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d they heard his voice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat? What do you say? Tell me again.\nWhat? Want money? Want _more_ money? But what do you want money for?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nThere was the confused sound of the Hindu\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s talking, then Halliday\nappeared in the room, smiling also foolishly, and saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe says he wants money to buy underclothing. Can anybody lend me a\nshilling? Oh thanks, a shilling will do to buy all the underclothes he\nwants.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He took the money from Gerald and went out into the passage\nagain, where they heard him saying, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want more money, you had\nthree and six yesterday. You mustn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t ask for any more. Bring the tea in\nquickly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked round the room. It was an ordinary London sitting-room in\na flat, evidently taken furnished, rather common and ugly. But there\nwere several negro statues, wood-carvings from West Africa, strange and\ndisturbing, the carved negroes looked almost like the f\u00c3\u0085\u00c2\u0093tus of a human\nbeing. One was a woman sitting naked in a strange posture, and looking\ntortured, her abdomen stuck out. The young Russian explained that she\nwas sitting in child-birth, clutching the ends of the band that hung\nfrom her neck, one in each hand, so that she could bear down, and help\nlabour. The strange, transfixed, rudimentary face of the woman again\nreminded Gerald of a f\u00c3\u0085\u00c2\u0093tus, it was also rather wonderful, conveying the\nsuggestion of the extreme of physical sensation, beyond the limits of\nmental consciousness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they rather obscene?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, disapproving.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d murmured the other rapidly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have never defined the\nobscene. I think they are very good.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald turned away. There were one or two new pictures in the room, in\nthe Futurist manner; there was a large piano. And these, with some\nordinary London lodging-house furniture of the better sort, completed\nthe whole.\n\nThe Pussum had taken off her hat and coat, and was seated on the sofa.\nShe was evidently quite at home in the house, but uncertain, suspended.\nShe did not quite know her position. Her alliance for the time being\nwas with Gerald, and she did not know how far this was admitted by any\nof the men. She was considering how she should carry off the situation.\nShe was determined to have her experience. Now, at this eleventh hour,\nshe was not to be baulked. Her face was flushed as with battle, her eye\nwas brooding but inevitable.\n\nThe man came in with tea and a bottle of K\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bcmmel. He set the tray on a\nlittle table before the couch.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPussum,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Halliday, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cpour out the tea.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe did not move.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you do it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Halliday repeated, in a state of nervous\napprehension.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve not come back here as it was before,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI only came\nbecause the others wanted me to, not for your sake.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy dear Pussum, you know you are your own mistress. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want you\nto do anything but use the flat for your own convenience\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you know it,\nI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve told you so many times.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe did not reply, but silently, reservedly reached for the tea-pot.\nThey all sat round and drank tea. Gerald could feel the electric\nconnection between him and her so strongly, as she sat there quiet and\nwithheld, that another set of conditions altogether had come to pass.\nHer silence and her immutability perplexed him. _How_ was he going to\ncome to her? And yet he felt it quite inevitable. He trusted completely\nto the current that held them. His perplexity was only superficial, new\nconditions reigned, the old were surpassed; here one did as one was\npossessed to do, no matter what it was.\n\nBirkin rose. It was nearly one o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going to bed,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll ring you up in the morning\nat your place or you ring me up here.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRight,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, and Birkin went out.\n\nWhen he was well gone, Halliday said in a stimulated voice, to Gerald:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI say, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you stay here\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094oh do!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t put everybody up,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh but I can, perfectly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there are three more beds besides mine\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094do\nstay, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you.

Halliday and he were friends since Eton.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s very simple,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, rising and pressing back his arms,\nstretching himself. Then he went again to look at one of the pictures.\nEvery one of his limbs was turgid with electric force, and his back was\ntense like a tiger\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, with slumbering fire. He was very proud.\n\nThe Pussum rose. She gave a black look at Halliday, black and deadly,\nwhich brought the rather foolishly pleased smile to that young man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nface. Then she went out of the room, with a cold good-night to them all\ngenerally.\n\nThere was a brief interval, they heard a door close, then Maxim said,\nin his refined voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked significantly at Gerald, and said again, with a silent nod:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked at the smooth, ruddy, comely face, and at the strange,\nsignificant eyes, and it seemed as if the voice of the young Russian,\nso small and perfect, sounded in the blood rather than in the air.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m_ all right then,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes! Yes! You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Russian.\n\nHalliday continued to smile, and to say nothing.\n\nSuddenly the Pussum appeared again in the door, her small, childish\nface looking sullen and vindictive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know you want to catch me out,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came her cold, rather resonant\nvoice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care how much you catch me out.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe turned and was gone again. She had been wearing a loose\ndressing-gown of purple silk, tied round her waist. She looked so small\nand childish and vulnerable, almost pitiful. And yet the black looks of\nher eyes made Gerald feel drowned in some potent darkness that almost\nfrightened him.\n\nThe men lit another cigarette and talked casually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER VII.\n\n\n FETISH\n\nIn the morning Gerald woke late. He had slept heavily. Pussum was still\nasleep, sleeping childishly and pathetically. There was something small\nand curled up and defenceless about her, that roused an unsatisfied\nflame of passion in the young man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood, a devouring avid pity. He\nlooked at her again. But it would be too cruel to wake her. He subdued\nhimself, and went away.\n\nHearing voices coming from the sitting-room, Halliday talking to\nLibidnikov, he went to the door and glanced in. He had on a silk wrap\nof a beautiful bluish colour, with an amethyst hem.\n\nTo his surprise he saw the two young men by the fire, stark naked.\nHalliday looked up, rather pleased.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-morning,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094did you want towels?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And stark naked he\nwent out into the hall, striding a strange, white figure between the\nunliving furniture. He came back with the towels, and took his former\nposition, crouching seated before the fire on the fender.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you love to feel the fire on your skin?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt _is_ rather pleasant,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow perfectly splendid it must be to be in a climate where one could\ndo without clothing altogether,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Halliday.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cif there weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t so many things that sting and\nbite.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a disadvantage,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d murmured Maxim.\n\nGerald looked at him, and with a slight revulsion saw the human animal,\ngolden skinned and bare, somehow humiliating. Halliday was different.\nHe had a rather heavy, slack, broken beauty, white and firm. He was\nlike a Christ in a Piet\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0. The animal was not there at all, only the\nheavy, broken beauty. And Gerald realised how Halliday\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes were\nbeautiful too, so blue and warm and confused, broken also in their\nexpression. The fireglow fell on his heavy, rather bowed shoulders, he\nsat slackly crouched on the fender, his face was uplifted, weak,\nperhaps slightly disintegrate, and yet with a moving beauty of its own.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Maxim, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been in hot countries where the people\ngo about naked.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh really!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Halliday. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSouth America\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Amazon,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh but how perfectly splendid! It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s one of the things I want most to\ndo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094to live from day to day without _ever_ putting on any sort of\nclothing whatever. If I could do that, I should feel I had lived.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see that it makes so much difference.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I think it would be perfectly splendid. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure life would be\nentirely another thing\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094entirely different, and perfectly wonderful.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094one would _feel_ things instead of merely looking at them. I should\nfeel the air move against me, and feel the things I touched, instead of\nhaving only to look at them. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure life is all wrong because it has\nbecome much too visual\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we can neither hear nor feel nor understand, we\ncan only see. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure that is entirely wrong.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, that is true, that is true,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Russian.\n\nGerald glanced at him, and saw him, his suave, golden coloured body\nwith the black hair growing fine and freely, like tendrils, and his\nlimbs like smooth plant-stems. He was so healthy and well-made, why did\nhe make one ashamed, why did one feel repelled? Why should Gerald even\ndislike it, why did it seem to him to detract from his own dignity. Was\nthat all a human being amounted to? So uninspired! thought Gerald.\n\nBirkin suddenly appeared in the doorway, in white pyjamas and wet hair,\nand a towel over his arm. He was aloof and white, and somehow\nevanescent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the bath-room now, if you want it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said generally, and was\ngoing away again, when Gerald called:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI say, Rupert!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The single white figure appeared again, a presence in the room.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you think of that figure there? I want to know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked.\n\nBirkin, white and strangely ghostly, went over to the carved figure of\nthe negro woman in labour. Her nude, protuberant body crouched in a\nstrange, clutching posture, her hands gripping the ends of the band,\nabove her breast.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is art,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery beautiful, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s very beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Russian.\n\nThey all drew near to look. Gerald looked at the group of men, the\nRussian golden and like a water-plant, Halliday tall and heavily,\nbrokenly beautiful, Birkin very white and indefinite, not to be\nassigned, as he looked closely at the carven woman. Strangely elated,\nGerald also lifted his eyes to the face of the wooden figure. And his\nheart contracted.\n\nHe saw vividly with his spirit the grey, forward-stretching face of the\nnegro woman, African and tense, abstracted in utter physical stress. It\nwas a terrible face, void, peaked, abstracted almost into\nmeaninglessness by the weight of sensation beneath. He saw the Pussum\nin it. As in a dream, he knew her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy is it art?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked, shocked, resentful.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt conveys a complete truth,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt contains the whole\ntruth of that state, whatever you feel about it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t call it _high_ art,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHigh! There are centuries and hundreds of centuries of development in\na straight line, behind that carving; it is an awful pitch of culture,\nof a definite sort.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat culture?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked, in opposition. He hated the sheer African\nthing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPure culture in sensation, culture in the physical consciousness,\nreally ultimate _physical_ consciousness, mindless, utterly sensual. It\nis so sensual as to be final, supreme.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut Gerald resented it. He wanted to keep certain illusions, certain\nideas like clothing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou like the wrong things, Rupert,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthings against\nyourself.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I know, this isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t everything,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Birkin replied, moving away.\n\nWhen Gerald went back to his room from the bath, he also carried his\nclothes. He was so conventional at home, that when he was really away,\nand on the loose, as now, he enjoyed nothing so much as full\noutrageousness. So he strode with his blue silk wrap over his arm and\nfelt defiant.\n\nThe Pussum lay in her bed, motionless, her round, dark eyes like black,\nunhappy pools. He could only see the black, bottomless pools of her\neyes. Perhaps she suffered. The sensation of her inchoate suffering\nroused the old sharp flame in him, a mordant pity, a passion almost of\ncruelty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are awake now,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat time is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came her muted voice.\n\nShe seemed to flow back, almost like liquid, from his approach, to sink\nhelplessly away from him. Her inchoate look of a violated slave, whose\nfulfilment lies in her further and further violation, made his nerves\nquiver with acutely desirable sensation. After all, his was the only\nwill, she was the passive substance of his will. He tingled with the\nsubtle, biting sensation. And then he knew, he must go away from her,\nthere must be pure separation between them.\n\nIt was a quiet and ordinary breakfast, the four men all looking very\nclean and bathed. Gerald and the Russian were both correct and _comme\nil faut_ in appearance and manner, Birkin was gaunt and sick, and\nlooked a failure in his attempt to be a properly dressed man, like\nGerald and Maxim. Halliday wore tweeds and a green flannel shirt, and a\nrag of a tie, which was just right for him. The Hindu brought in a\ngreat deal of soft toast, and looked exactly the same as he had looked\nthe night before, statically the same.\n\nAt the end of the breakfast the Pussum appeared, in a purple silk wrap\nwith a shimmering sash. She had recovered herself somewhat, but was\nmute and lifeless still. It was a torment to her when anybody spoke to\nher. Her face was like a small, fine mask, sinister too, masked with\nunwilling suffering. It was almost midday. Gerald rose and went away to\nhis business, glad to get out. But he had not finished. He was coming\nback again at evening, they were all dining together, and he had booked\nseats for the party, excepting Birkin, at a music-hall.\n\nAt night they came back to the flat very late again, again flushed with\ndrink. Again the man-servant\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094who invariably disappeared between the\nhours of ten and twelve at night\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094came in silently and inscrutably with\ntea, bending in a slow, strange, leopard-like fashion to put the tray\nsoftly on the table. His face was immutable, aristocratic-looking,\ntinged slightly with grey under the skin; he was young and\ngood-looking. But Birkin felt a slight sickness, looking at him, and\nfeeling the slight greyness as an ash or a corruption, in the\naristocratic inscrutability of expression a nauseating, bestial\nstupidity.\n\nAgain they talked cordially and rousedly together. But already a\ncertain friability was coming over the party, Birkin was mad with\nirritation, Halliday was turning in an insane hatred against Gerald,\nthe Pussum was becoming hard and cold, like a flint knife, and Halliday\nwas laying himself out to her. And her intention, ultimately, was to\ncapture Halliday, to have complete power over him.\n\nIn the morning they all stalked and lounged about again. But Gerald\ncould feel a strange hostility to himself, in the air. It roused his\nobstinacy, and he stood up against it. He hung on for two more days.\nThe result was a nasty and insane scene with Halliday on the fourth\nevening. Halliday turned with absurd animosity upon Gerald, in the\ncaf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9. There was a row. Gerald was on the point of knocking-in\nHalliday\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face; when he was filled with sudden disgust and\nindifference, and he went away, leaving Halliday in a foolish state of\ngloating triumph, the Pussum hard and established, and Maxim standing\nclear. Birkin was absent, he had gone out of town again.\n\nGerald was piqued because he had left without giving the Pussum money.\nIt was true, she did not care whether he gave her money or not, and he\nknew it. But she would have been glad of ten pounds, and he would have\nbeen _very_ glad to give them to her. Now he felt in a false position.\nHe went away chewing his lips to get at the ends of his short clipped\nmoustache. He knew the Pussum was merely glad to be rid of him. She had\ngot her Halliday whom she wanted. She wanted him completely in her\npower. Then she would marry him. She wanted to marry him. She had set\nher will on marrying Halliday. She never wanted to hear of Gerald\nagain; unless, perhaps, she were in difficulty; because after all,\nGerald was what she called a man, and these others, Halliday,\nLibidnikov, Birkin, the whole Bohemian set, they were only half men.\nBut it was half men she could deal with. She felt sure of herself with\nthem. The real men, like Gerald, put her in her place too much.\n\nStill, she respected Gerald, she really respected him. She had managed\nto get his address, so that she could appeal to him in time of\ndistress. She knew he wanted to give her money. She would perhaps write\nto him on that inevitable rainy day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER VIII.\n\n\n BREADALBY\n\nBreadalby was a Georgian house with Corinthian pillars, standing among\nthe softer, greener hills of Derbyshire, not far from Cromford. In\nfront, it looked over a lawn, over a few trees, down to a string of\nfish-ponds in the hollow of the silent park. At the back were trees,\namong which were to be found the stables, and the big kitchen garden,\nbehind which was a wood.\n\nIt was a very quiet place, some miles from the high-road, back from the\nDerwent Valley, outside the show scenery. Silent and forsaken, the\ngolden stucco showed between the trees, the house-front looked down the\npark, unchanged and unchanging.\n\nOf late, however, Hermione had lived a good deal at the house. She had\nturned away from London, away from Oxford, towards the silence of the\ncountry. Her father was mostly absent, abroad, she was either alone in\nthe house, with her visitors, of whom there were always several, or she\nhad with her her brother, a bachelor, and a Liberal member of\nParliament. He always came down when the House was not sitting, seemed\nalways to be present in Breadalby, although he was most conscientious\nin his attendance to duty.\n\nThe summer was just coming in when Ursula and Gudrun went to stay the\nsecond time with Hermione. Coming along in the car, after they had\nentered the park, they looked across the dip, where the fish-ponds lay\nin silence, at the pillared front of the house, sunny and small like an\nEnglish drawing of the old school, on the brow of the green hill,\nagainst the trees. There were small figures on the green lawn, women in\nlavender and yellow moving to the shade of the enormous, beautifully\nbalanced cedar tree.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it complete!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is as final as an old aquatint.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nShe spoke with some resentment in her voice, as if she were captivated\nunwillingly, as if she must admire against her will.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you love it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _love_ it, but in its way, I think it is quite complete.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe motor-car ran down the hill and up again in one breath, and they\nwere curving to the side door. A parlour-maid appeared, and then\nHermione, coming forward with her pale face lifted, and her hands\noutstretched, advancing straight to the newcomers, her voice singing:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHere you are\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so glad to see you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she kissed Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cso glad to\nsee you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she kissed Ursula and remained with her arm round her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre\nyou very tired?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot at all tired,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you tired, Gudrun?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot at all, thanks,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d drawled Hermione. And she stood and looked at them. The two girls\nwere embarrassed because she would not move into the house, but must\nhave her little scene of welcome there on the path. The servants\nwaited.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome in,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione at last, having fully taken in the pair of\nthem. Gudrun was the more beautiful and attractive, she had decided\nagain, Ursula was more physical, more womanly. She admired Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ndress more. It was of green poplin, with a loose coat above it, of\nbroad, dark-green and dark-brown stripes. The hat was of a pale,\ngreenish straw, the colour of new hay, and it had a plaited ribbon of\nblack and orange, the stockings were dark green, the shoes black. It\nwas a good get-up, at once fashionable and individual. Ursula, in dark\nblue, was more ordinary, though she also looked well.\n\nHermione herself wore a dress of prune-coloured silk, with coral beads\nand coral coloured stockings. But her dress was both shabby and soiled,\neven rather dirty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou would like to see your rooms now, wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you! Yes. We will go up\nnow, shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula was glad when she could be left alone in her room. Hermione\nlingered so long, made such a stress on one. She stood so near to one,\npressing herself near upon one, in a way that was most embarrassing and\noppressive. She seemed to hinder one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s workings.\n\nLunch was served on the lawn, under the great tree, whose thick,\nblackish boughs came down close to the grass. There were present a\nyoung Italian woman, slight and fashionable, a young, athletic-looking\nMiss Bradley, a learned, dry Baronet of fifty, who was always making\nwitticisms and laughing at them heartily in a harsh, horse-laugh, there\nwas Rupert Birkin, and then a woman secretary, a Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein M\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4rz, young\nand slim and pretty.\n\nThe food was very good, that was one thing. Gudrun, critical of\neverything, gave it her full approval. Ursula loved the situation, the\nwhite table by the cedar tree, the scent of new sunshine, the little\nvision of the leafy park, with far-off deer feeding peacefully. There\nseemed a magic circle drawn about the place, shutting out the present,\nenclosing the delightful, precious past, trees and deer and silence,\nlike a dream.\n\nBut in spirit she was unhappy. The talk went on like a rattle of small\nartillery, always slightly sententious, with a sententiousness that was\nonly emphasised by the continual crackling of a witticism, the\ncontinual spatter of verbal jest, designed to give a tone of flippancy\nto a stream of conversation that was all critical and general, a canal\nof conversation rather than a stream.\n\nThe attitude was mental and very wearying. Only the elderly\nsociologist, whose mental fibre was so tough as to be insentient,\nseemed to be thoroughly happy. Birkin was down in the mouth. Hermione\nappeared, with amazing persistence, to wish to ridicule him and make\nhim look ignominious in the eyes of everybody. And it was surprising\nhow she seemed to succeed, how helpless he seemed against her. He\nlooked completely insignificant. Ursula and Gudrun, both very unused,\nwere mostly silent, listening to the slow, rhapsodic sing-song of\nHermione, or the verbal sallies of Sir Joshua, or the prattle of\nFr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein, or the responses of the other two women.\n\nLuncheon was over, coffee was brought out on the grass, the party left\nthe table and sat about in lounge chairs, in the shade or in the\nsunshine as they wished. Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein departed into the house, Hermione\ntook up her embroidery, the little Contessa took a book, Miss Bradley\nwas weaving a basket out of fine grass, and there they all were on the\nlawn in the early summer afternoon, working leisurely and spattering\nwith half-intellectual, deliberate talk.\n\nSuddenly there was the sound of the brakes and the shutting off of a\nmotor-car.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Salsie!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, in her slow, amusing sing-song. And\nlaying down her work, she rose slowly, and slowly passed over the lawn,\nround the bushes, out of sight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMr Roddice\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Miss Roddice\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s brother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094at least, I suppose it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s he,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nSir Joshua.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSalsie, yes, it is her brother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the little Contessa, lifting her\nhead for a moment from her book, and speaking as if to give\ninformation, in her slightly deepened, guttural English.\n\nThey all waited. And then round the bushes came the tall form of\nAlexander Roddice, striding romantically like a Meredith hero who\nremembers Disraeli. He was cordial with everybody, he was at once a\nhost, with an easy, offhand hospitality that he had learned for\nHermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s friends. He had just come down from London, from the House.\nAt once the atmosphere of the House of Commons made itself felt over\nthe lawn: the Home Secretary had said such and such a thing, and he,\nRoddice, on the other hand, thought such and such a thing, and had said\nso-and-so to the PM.\n\nNow Hermione came round the bushes with Gerald Crich. He had come along\nwith Alexander. Gerald was presented to everybody, was kept by Hermione\nfor a few moments in full view, then he was led away, still by\nHermione. He was evidently her guest of the moment.\n\nThere had been a split in the Cabinet; the minister for Education had\nresigned owing to adverse criticism. This started a conversation on\neducation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, lifting her face like a rhapsodist, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\n_can_ be no reason, no _excuse_ for education, except the joy and\nbeauty of knowledge in itself.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She seemed to rumble and ruminate with\nsubterranean thoughts for a minute, then she proceeded: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVocational\neducation _isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ education, it is the close of education.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald, on the brink of discussion, sniffed the air with delight and\nprepared for action.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot necessarily,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t education really like\ngymnastics, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the end of education the production of a\nwell-trained, vigorous, energetic mind?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cJust as athletics produce a healthy body, ready for anything,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried\nMiss Bradley, in hearty accord.\n\nGudrun looked at her in silent loathing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rumbled Hermione, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know.

And they had all to come this way. The daffodils\nwere pretty, but who could see them? Ursula was stiff all over with\nresentment by this time, resentment of the whole atmosphere. Gudrun,\nmocking and objective, watched and registered everything.\n\nThey looked at the shy deer, and Hermione talked to the stag, as if he\ntoo were a boy she wanted to wheedle and fondle. He was male, so she\nmust exert some kind of power over him. They trailed home by the\nfish-ponds, and Hermione told them about the quarrel of two male swans,\nwho had striven for the love of the one lady. She chuckled and laughed\nas she told how the ousted lover had sat with his head buried under his\nwing, on the gravel.\n\nWhen they arrived back at the house, Hermione stood on the lawn and\nsang out, in a strange, small, high voice that carried very far:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRupert!

And she remained looking at him. She was\nstimulated above all things by this conflict with him, when he was like\na sulky boy, helpless, and she had him safe at Breadalby. But\nunderneath she knew the split was coming, and her hatred of him was\nsubconscious and intense.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat were you doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she reiterated, in her mild, indifferent tone.\nHe did not answer, and she made her way, almost unconsciously into his\nroom. He had taken a Chinese drawing of geese from the boudoir, and was\ncopying it, with much skill and vividness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are copying the drawing,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, standing near the table, and\nlooking down at his work. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.

She _must_ know. It was a dreadful\ntyranny, an obsession in her, to know all he knew. For some time he was\nsilent, hating to answer her. Then, compelled, he began:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know what centres they live from\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what they perceive and feel\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the\nhot, stinging centrality of a goose in the flux of cold water and\nmud\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the curious bitter stinging heat of a goose\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood, entering their\nown blood like an inoculation of corruptive fire\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094fire of the\ncold-burning mud\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the lotus mystery.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione looked at him along her narrow, pallid cheeks. Her eyes were\nstrange and drugged, heavy under their heavy, drooping lids. Her thin\nbosom shrugged convulsively. He stared back at her, devilish and\nunchanging. With another strange, sick convulsion, she turned away, as\nif she were sick, could feel dissolution setting-in in her body. For\nwith her mind she was unable to attend to his words, he caught her, as\nit were, beneath all her defences, and destroyed her with some\ninsidious occult potency.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, as if she did not know what she were saying. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nand she swallowed, and tried to regain her mind. But she could not, she\nwas witless, decentralised. Use all her will as she might, she could\nnot recover. She suffered the ghastliness of dissolution, broken and\ngone in a horrible corruption. And he stood and looked at her unmoved.\nShe strayed out, pallid and preyed-upon like a ghost, like one attacked\nby the tomb-influences which dog us. And she was gone like a corpse,\nthat has no presence, no connection. He remained hard and vindictive.\n\nHermione came down to dinner strange and sepulchral, her eyes heavy and\nfull of sepulchral darkness, strength. She had put on a dress of stiff\nold greenish brocade, that fitted tight and made her look tall and\nrather terrible, ghastly. In the gay light of the drawing-room she was\nuncanny and oppressive. But seated in the half-light of the\ndining-room, sitting stiffly before the shaded candles on the table,\nshe seemed a power, a presence. She listened and attended with a\ndrugged attention.\n\nThe party was gay and extravagant in appearance, everybody had put on\nevening dress except Birkin and Joshua Mattheson. The little Italian\nContessa wore a dress of tissue, of orange and gold and black velvet in\nsoft wide stripes, Gudrun was emerald green with strange net-work,\nUrsula was in yellow with dull silver veiling, Miss Bradley was of\ngrey, crimson and jet, Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein M\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4rz wore pale blue. It gave Hermione a\nsudden convulsive sensation of pleasure, to see these rich colours\nunder the candle-light. She was aware of the talk going on,\nceaselessly, Joshua\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice dominating; of the ceaseless pitter-patter\nof women\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s light laughter and responses; of the brilliant colours and\nthe white table and the shadow above and below; and she seemed in a\nswoon of gratification, convulsed with pleasure and yet sick, like a\n_revenant_. She took very little part in the conversation, yet she\nheard it all, it was all hers.\n\nThey all went together into the drawing-room, as if they were one\nfamily, easily, without any attention to ceremony. Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein handed the\ncoffee, everybody smoked cigarettes, or else long warden pipes of white\nclay, of which a sheaf was provided.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you smoke?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094cigarettes or pipe?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein prettily. There\nwas a circle of people, Sir Joshua with his eighteenth-century\nappearance, Gerald the amused, handsome young Englishman, Alexander\ntall and the handsome politician, democratic and lucid, Hermione\nstrange like a long Cassandra, and the women lurid with colour, all\ndutifully smoking their long white pipes, and sitting in a half-moon in\nthe comfortable, soft-lighted drawing-room, round the logs that\nflickered on the marble hearth.\n\nThe talk was very often political or sociological, and interesting,\ncuriously anarchistic. There was an accumulation of powerful force in\nthe room, powerful and destructive. Everything seemed to be thrown into\nthe melting pot, and it seemed to Ursula they were all witches, helping\nthe pot to bubble. There was an elation and a satisfaction in it all,\nbut it was cruelly exhausting for the newcomers, this ruthless mental\npressure, this powerful, consuming, destructive mentality that emanated\nfrom Joshua and Hermione and Birkin and dominated the rest.\n\nBut a sickness, a fearful nausea gathered possession of Hermione. There\nwas a lull in the talk, as it was arrested by her unconscious but\nall-powerful will.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSalsie, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you play something?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, breaking off\ncompletely. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t somebody dance?

It was\nfinally decided to do Naomi and Ruth and Orpah. Ursula was Naomi,\nGudrun was Ruth, the Contessa was Orpah. The idea was to make a little\nballet, in the style of the Russian Ballet of Pavlova and Nijinsky.\n\nThe Contessa was ready first, Alexander went to the piano, a space was\ncleared. Orpah, in beautiful oriental clothes, began slowly to dance\nthe death of her husband. Then Ruth came, and they wept together, and\nlamented, then Naomi came to comfort them. It was all done in dumb\nshow, the women danced their emotion in gesture and motion. The little\ndrama went on for a quarter of an hour.\n\nUrsula was beautiful as Naomi. All her men were dead, it remained to\nher only to stand alone in indomitable assertion, demanding nothing.\nRuth, woman-loving, loved her. Orpah, a vivid, sensational, subtle\nwidow, would go back to the former life, a repetition. The interplay\nbetween the women was real and rather frightening. It was strange to\nsee how Gudrun clung with heavy, desperate passion to Ursula, yet\nsmiled with subtle malevolence against her, how Ursula accepted\nsilently, unable to provide any more either for herself or for the\nother, but dangerous and indomitable, refuting her grief.\n\nHermione loved to watch. She could see the Contessa\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s rapid, stoat-like\nsensationalism, Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ultimate but treacherous cleaving to the woman\nin her sister, Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dangerous helplessness, as if she were\nhelplessly weighted, and unreleased.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat was very beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d everybody cried with one accord. But\nHermione writhed in her soul, knowing what she could not know. She\ncried out for more dancing, and it was her will that set the Contessa\nand Birkin moving mockingly in Malbrouk.\n\nGerald was excited by the desperate cleaving of Gudrun to Naomi. The\nessence of that female, subterranean recklessness and mockery\npenetrated his blood. He could not forget Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s lifted, offered,\ncleaving, reckless, yet withal mocking weight. And Birkin, watching\nlike a hermit crab from its hole, had seen the brilliant frustration\nand helplessness of Ursula. She was rich, full of dangerous power. She\nwas like a strange unconscious bud of powerful womanhood. He was\nunconsciously drawn to her. She was his future.\n\nAlexander played some Hungarian music, and they all danced, seized by\nthe spirit. Gerald was marvellously exhilarated at finding himself in\nmotion, moving towards Gudrun, dancing with feet that could not yet\nescape from the waltz and the two-step, but feeling his force stir\nalong his limbs and his body, out of captivity. He did not know yet how\nto dance their convulsive, rag-time sort of dancing, but he knew how to\nbegin. Birkin, when he could get free from the weight of the people\npresent, whom he disliked, danced rapidly and with a real gaiety. And\nhow Hermione hated him for this irresponsible gaiety.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow I see,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the Contessa excitedly, watching his purely gay\nmotion, which he had all to himself. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMr Birkin, he is a changer.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione looked at her slowly, and shuddered, knowing that only a\nforeigner could have seen and have said this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Cosa vuol\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099dire, Palestra?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, sing-song.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Contessa, in Italian. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is not a man, he is a\nchameleon, a creature of change.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is not a man, he is treacherous, not one of us,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said itself over\nin Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s consciousness. And her soul writhed in the black\nsubjugation to him, because of his power to escape, to exist, other\nthan she did, because he was not consistent, not a man, less than a\nman. She hated him in a despair that shattered her and broke her down,\nso that she suffered sheer dissolution like a corpse, and was\nunconscious of everything save the horrible sickness of dissolution\nthat was taking place within her, body and soul.\n\nThe house being full, Gerald was given the smaller room, really the\ndressing-room, communicating with Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bedroom. When they all took\ntheir candles and mounted the stairs, where the lamps were burning\nsubduedly, Hermione captured Ursula and brought her into her own\nbedroom, to talk to her. A sort of constraint came over Ursula in the\nbig, strange bedroom. Hermione seemed to be bearing down on her, awful\nand inchoate, making some appeal. They were looking at some Indian silk\nshirts, gorgeous and sensual in themselves, their shape, their almost\ncorrupt gorgeousness. And Hermione came near, and her bosom writhed,\nand Ursula was for a moment blank with panic. And for a moment\nHermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s haggard eyes saw the fear on the face of the other, there\nwas again a sort of crash, a crashing down. And Ursula picked up a\nshirt of rich red and blue silk, made for a young princess of fourteen,\nand was crying mechanically:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it wonderful\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094who would dare to put those two strong colours\ntogether\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThen Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s maid entered silently and Ursula, overcome with dread,\nescaped, carried away by powerful impulse.\n\nBirkin went straight to bed. He was feeling happy, and sleepy. Since he\nhad danced he was happy. But Gerald would talk to him. Gerald, in\nevening dress, sat on Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bed when the other lay down, and must\ntalk.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho are those two Brangwens?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey live in Beldover.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn Beldover!

Hermione\nliked everybody to be early. She suffered when she felt her day was\ndiminished, she felt she had missed her life. She seemed to grip the\nhours by the throat, to force her life from them. She was rather pale\nand ghastly, as if left behind, in the morning. Yet she had her power,\nher will was strangely pervasive. With the entrance of the two young\nmen a sudden tension was felt.\n\nShe lifted her face, and said, in her amused sing-song:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood morning! Did you sleep well? I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so glad.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she turned away, ignoring them. Birkin, who knew her well, saw that\nshe intended to discount his existence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you take what you want from the sideboard?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Alexander, in a\nvoice slightly suggesting disapprobation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI hope the things aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ncold. Oh no! Do you mind putting out the flame under the chafing-dish,\nRupert? Thank you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nEven Alexander was rather authoritative where Hermione was cool. He\ntook his tone from her, inevitably. Birkin sat down and looked at the\ntable. He was so used to this house, to this room, to this atmosphere,\nthrough years of intimacy, and now he felt in complete opposition to it\nall, it had nothing to do with him. How well he knew Hermione, as she\nsat there, erect and silent and somewhat bemused, and yet so potent, so\npowerful! He knew her statically, so finally, that it was almost like a\nmadness. It was difficult to believe one was not mad, that one was not\na figure in the hall of kings in some Egyptian tomb, where the dead all\nsat immemorial and tremendous. How utterly he knew Joshua Mattheson,\nwho was talking in his harsh, yet rather mincing voice, endlessly,\nendlessly, always with a strong mentality working, always interesting,\nand yet always known, everything he said known beforehand, however\nnovel it was, and clever. Alexander the up-to-date host, so bloodlessly\nfree-and-easy, Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein so prettily chiming in just as she should, the\nlittle Italian Countess taking notice of everybody, only playing her\nlittle game, objective and cold, like a weasel watching everything, and\nextracting her own amusement, never giving herself in the slightest;\nthen Miss Bradley, heavy and rather subservient, treated with cool,\nalmost amused contempt by Hermione, and therefore slighted by\neverybody\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094how known it all was, like a game with the figures set out,\nthe same figures, the Queen of chess, the knights, the pawns, the same\nnow as they were hundreds of years ago, the same figures moving round\nin one of the innumerable permutations that make up the game. But the\ngame is known, its going on is like a madness, it is so exhausted.\n\nThere was Gerald, an amused look on his face; the game pleased him.\nThere was Gudrun, watching with steady, large, hostile eyes; the game\nfascinated her, and she loathed it. There was Ursula, with a slightly\nstartled look on her face, as if she were hurt, and the pain were just\noutside her consciousness.\n\nSuddenly Birkin got up and went out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s enough,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to himself involuntarily.\n\nHermione knew his motion, though not in her consciousness. She lifted\nher heavy eyes and saw him lapse suddenly away, on a sudden, unknown\ntide, and the waves broke over her. Only her indomitable will remained\nstatic and mechanical, she sat at the table making her musing, stray\nremarks. But the darkness had covered her, she was like a ship that has\ngone down. It was finished for her too, she was wrecked in the\ndarkness. Yet the unfailing mechanism of her will worked on, she had\nthat activity.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we bathe this morning?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, suddenly looking at them all.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSplendid,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Joshua. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is a perfect morning.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, it is beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, let us bathe,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Italian woman.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe have no bathing suits,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave mine,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Alexander. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI must go to church and read the lessons.\nThey expect me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you a Christian?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked the Italian Countess, with sudden\ninterest.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Alexander. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not.

It was a sunny, soft morning in\nearly summer, when life ran in the world subtly, like a reminiscence.\nThe church bells were ringing a little way off, not a cloud was in the\nsky, the swans were like lilies on the water below, the peacocks walked\nwith long, prancing steps across the shadow and into the sunshine of\nthe grass. One wanted to swoon into the by-gone perfection of it all.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called Alexander, waving his gloves cheerily, and he\ndisappeared behind the bushes, on his way to church.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cshall we all bathe?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, looking at her slowly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNor I,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat about my suit?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Hermione, with an odd, amused intonation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill\na handkerchief do\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a large handkerchief?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat will do,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome along then,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione.\n\nThe first to run across the lawn was the little Italian, small and like\na cat, her white legs twinkling as she went, ducking slightly her head,\nthat was tied in a gold silk kerchief. She tripped through the gate and\ndown the grass, and stood, like a tiny figure of ivory and bronze, at\nthe water\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s edge, having dropped off her towelling, watching the swans,\nwhich came up in surprise. Then out ran Miss Bradley, like a large,\nsoft plum in her dark-blue suit. Then Gerald came, a scarlet silk\nkerchief round his loins, his towels over his arms. He seemed to flaunt\nhimself a little in the sun, lingering and laughing, strolling easily,\nlooking white but natural in his nakedness. Then came Sir Joshua, in an\novercoat, and lastly Hermione, striding with stiff grace from out of a\ngreat mantle of purple silk, her head tied up in purple and gold.\nHandsome was her stiff, long body, her straight-stepping white legs,\nthere was a static magnificence about her as she let the cloak float\nloosely away from her striding. She crossed the lawn like some strange\nmemory, and passed slowly and statelily towards the water.\n\nThere were three ponds, in terraces descending the valley, large and\nsmooth and beautiful, lying in the sun. The water ran over a little\nstone wall, over small rocks, splashing down from one pond to the level\nbelow. The swans had gone out on to the opposite bank, the reeds\nsmelled sweet, a faint breeze touched the skin.\n\nGerald had dived in, after Sir Joshua, and had swum to the end of the\npond. There he climbed out and sat on the wall. There was a dive, and\nthe little Countess was swimming like a rat, to join him. They both sat\nin the sun, laughing and crossing their arms on their breasts. Sir\nJoshua swam up to them, and stood near them, up to his arm-pits in the\nwater. Then Hermione and Miss Bradley swam over, and they sat in a row\non the embankment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they terrifying?

They are just like great lizards. Did you\never see anything like Sir Joshua? But really, Ursula, he belongs to\nthe primeval world, when great lizards crawled about.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun looked in dismay on Sir Joshua, who stood up to the breast in\nthe water, his long, greyish hair washed down into his eyes, his neck\nset into thick, crude shoulders. He was talking to Miss Bradley, who,\nseated on the bank above, plump and big and wet, looked as if she might\nroll and slither in the water almost like one of the slithering\nsealions in the Zoo.\n\nUrsula watched in silence. Gerald was laughing happily, between\nHermione and the Italian. He reminded her of Dionysos, because his hair\nwas really yellow, his figure so full and laughing. Hermione, in her\nlarge, stiff, sinister grace, leaned near him, frightening, as if she\nwere not responsible for what she might do. He knew a certain danger in\nher, a convulsive madness. But he only laughed the more, turning often\nto the little Countess, who was flashing up her face at him.\n\nThey all dropped into the water, and were swimming together like a\nshoal of seals. Hermione was powerful and unconscious in the water,\nlarge and slow and powerful. Palestra was quick and silent as a water\nrat, Gerald wavered and flickered, a white natural shadow. Then, one\nafter the other, they waded out, and went up to the house.\n\nBut Gerald lingered a moment to speak to Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like the water?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe looked at him with a long, slow inscrutable look, as he stood\nbefore her negligently, the water standing in beads all over his skin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI like it very much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied.\n\nHe paused, expecting some sort of explanation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you swim?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I swim.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nStill he would not ask her why she would not go in then. He could feel\nsomething ironic in her. He walked away, piqued for the first time.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you bathe?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked her again, later, when he was once\nmore the properly-dressed young Englishman.\n\nShe hesitated a moment before answering, opposing his persistence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause I didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like the crowd,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied.\n\nHe laughed, her phrase seemed to re-echo in his consciousness. The\nflavour of her slang was piquant to him. Whether he would or not, she\nsignified the real world to him. He wanted to come up to her standards,\nfulfil her expectations. He knew that her criterion was the only one\nthat mattered. The others were all outsiders, instinctively, whatever\nthey might be socially. And Gerald could not help it, he was bound to\nstrive to come up to her criterion, fulfil her idea of a man and a\nhuman-being.\n\nAfter lunch, when all the others had withdrawn, Hermione and Gerald and\nBirkin lingered, finishing their talk. There had been some discussion,\non the whole quite intellectual and artificial, about a new state, a\nnew world of man. Supposing this old social state _were_ broken and\ndestroyed, then, out of the chaos, what then?\n\nThe great social idea, said Sir Joshua, was the _social_ equality of\nman. No, said Gerald, the idea was, that every man was fit for his own\nlittle bit of a task\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094let him do that, and then please himself. The\nunifying principle was the work in hand. Only work, the business of\nproduction, held men together. It was mechanical, but then society\n_was_ a mechanism. Apart from work they were isolated, free to do as\nthey liked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen we shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t have names any more\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we shall be\nlike the Germans, nothing but Herr Obermeister and Herr Untermeister. I\ncan imagine it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098I am Mrs Colliery-Manager Crich\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I am Mrs\nMember-of-Parliament Roddice. I am Miss Art-Teacher Brangwen.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 Very\npretty that.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThings would work very much better, Miss Art-Teacher Brangwen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nGerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat things, Mr Colliery-Manager Crich? The relation between you and\nme, _par exemple?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, for example,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the Italian. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat which is between men and\nwomen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is non-social,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, sarcastically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExactly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBetween me and a woman, the social question\ndoes not enter. It is my own affair.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA ten-pound note on it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t admit that a woman is a social being?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula of\nGerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe is both,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe is a social being, as far as society\nis concerned. But for her own private self, she is a free agent, it is\nher own affair, what she does.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it be rather difficult to arrange the two halves?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked\nUrsula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey arrange themselves naturally\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we see it\nnow, everywhere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you laugh so pleasantly till you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re out of the wood,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nBirkin.\n\nGerald knitted his brows in momentary irritation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas I laughing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_If_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione at last, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe could only realise, that in the\n_spirit_ we are all one, all equal in the spirit, all brothers\nthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the rest wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter, there would be no more of this carping\nand envy and this struggle for power, which destroys, only destroys.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThis speech was received in silence, and almost immediately the party\nrose from the table. But when the others had gone, Birkin turned round\nin bitter declamation, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is just the opposite, just the contrary, Hermione. We are all\ndifferent and unequal in spirit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is only the _social_ differences\nthat are based on accidental material conditions. We are all abstractly\nor mathematically equal, if you like. Every man has hunger and thirst,\ntwo eyes, one nose and two legs. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all the same in point of number.\nBut spiritually, there is pure difference and neither equality nor\ninequality counts. It is upon these two bits of knowledge that you must\nfound a state. Your democracy is an absolute lie\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094your brotherhood of\nman is a pure falsity, if you apply it further than the mathematical\nabstraction. We all drank milk first, we all eat bread and meat, we all\nwant to ride in motor-cars\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094therein lies the beginning and the end of\nthe brotherhood of man. But no equality.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I, myself, who am myself, what have I to do with equality with any\nother man or woman? In the spirit, I am as separate as one star is from\nanother, as different in quality and quantity. Establish a state on\n_that_. One man isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t any better than another, not because they are\nequal, but because they are intrinsically _other_, that there is no\nterm of comparison. The minute you begin to compare, one man is seen to\nbe far better than another, all the inequality you can imagine is there\nby nature. I want every man to have his share in the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s goods, so\nthat I am rid of his importunity, so that I can tell him: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Now you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve\ngot what you want\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got your fair share of the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gear. Now,\nyou one-mouthed fool, mind yourself and don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t obstruct me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione was looking at him with leering eyes, along her cheeks. He\ncould feel violent waves of hatred and loathing of all he said, coming\nout of her. It was dynamic hatred and loathing, coming strong and black\nout of the unconsciousness. She heard his words in her unconscious\nself, _consciously_ she was as if deafened, she paid no heed to them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt _sounds_ like megalomania, Rupert,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, genially.\n\nHermione gave a queer, grunting sound. Birkin stood back.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, let it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said suddenly, the whole tone gone out of his voice,\nthat had been so insistent, bearing everybody down. And he went away.\n\nBut he felt, later, a little compunction. He had been violent, cruel\nwith poor Hermione. He wanted to recompense her, to make it up. He had\nhurt her, he had been vindictive. He wanted to be on good terms with\nher again.\n\nHe went into her boudoir, a remote and very cushiony place. She was\nsitting at her table writing letters. She lifted her face abstractedly\nwhen he entered, watched him go to the sofa, and sit down. Then she\nlooked down at her paper again.\n\nHe took up a large volume which he had been reading before, and became\nminutely attentive to his author. His back was towards Hermione. She\ncould not go on with her writing. Her whole mind was a chaos, darkness\nbreaking in upon it, and herself struggling to gain control with her\nwill, as a swimmer struggles with the swirling water. But in spite of\nher efforts she was borne down, darkness seemed to break over her, she\nfelt as if her heart was bursting. The terrible tension grew stronger\nand stronger, it was most fearful agony, like being walled up.\n\nAnd then she realised that his presence was the wall, his presence was\ndestroying her. Unless she could break out, she must die most\nfearfully, walled up in horror. And he was the wall. She must break\ndown the wall\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she must break him down before her, the awful obstruction\nof him who obstructed her life to the last. It must be done, or she\nmust perish most horribly.\n\nTerrible shocks ran over her body, like shocks of electricity, as if\nmany volts of electricity suddenly struck her down. She was aware of\nhim sitting silently there, an unthinkable evil obstruction. Only this\nblotted out her mind, pressed out her very breathing, his silent,\nstooping back, the back of his head.\n\nA terrible voluptuous thrill ran down her arms\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she was going to know\nher voluptuous consummation. Her arms quivered and were strong,\nimmeasurably and irresistibly strong. What delight, what delight in\nstrength, what delirium of pleasure! She was going to have her\nconsummation of voluptuous ecstasy at last. It was coming! In utmost\nterror and agony, she knew it was upon her now, in extremity of bliss.\nHer hand closed on a blue, beautiful ball of lapis lazuli that stood on\nher desk for a paper-weight. She rolled it round in her hand as she\nrose silently. Her heart was a pure flame in her breast, she was purely\nunconscious in ecstasy. She moved towards him and stood behind him for\na moment in ecstasy. He, closed within the spell, remained motionless\nand unconscious.\n\nThen swiftly, in a flame that drenched down her body like fluid\nlightning and gave her a perfect, unutterable consummation, unutterable\nsatisfaction, she brought down the ball of jewel stone with all her\nforce, crash on his head. But her fingers were in the way and deadened\nthe blow. Nevertheless, down went his head on the table on which his\nbook lay, the stone slid aside and over his ear, it was one convulsion\nof pure bliss for her, lit up by the crushed pain of her fingers. But\nit was not somehow complete. She lifted her arm high to aim once more,\nstraight down on the head that lay dazed on the table. She must smash\nit, it must be smashed before her ecstasy was consummated, fulfilled\nfor ever. A thousand lives, a thousand deaths mattered nothing now,\nonly the fulfilment of this perfect ecstasy.\n\nShe was not swift, she could only move slowly. A strong spirit in him\nwoke him and made him lift his face and twist to look at her. Her arm\nwas raised, the hand clasping the ball of lapis lazuli. It was her left\nhand, he realised again with horror that she was left-handed.\nHurriedly, with a burrowing motion, he covered his head under the thick\nvolume of Thucydides, and the blow came down, almost breaking his neck,\nand shattering his heart.\n\nHe was shattered, but he was not afraid. Twisting round to face her he\npushed the table over and got away from her. He was like a flask that\nis smashed to atoms, he seemed to himself that he was all fragments,\nsmashed to bits. Yet his movements were perfectly coherent and clear,\nhis soul was entire and unsurprised.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t, Hermione,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said in a low voice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t let you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe saw her standing tall and livid and attentive, the stone clenched\ntense in her hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cStand away and let me go,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, drawing near to her.\n\nAs if pressed back by some hand, she stood away, watching him all the\ntime without changing, like a neutralised angel confronting him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is not good,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, when he had gone past her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t I who\nwill die. You hear?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe kept his face to her as he went out, lest she should strike again.\nWhile he was on his guard, she dared not move. And he was on his guard,\nshe was powerless. So he had gone, and left her standing.\n\nShe remained perfectly rigid, standing as she was for a long time. Then\nshe staggered to the couch and lay down, and went heavily to sleep.\nWhen she awoke, she remembered what she had done, but it seemed to her,\nshe had only hit him, as any woman might do, because he tortured her.\nShe was perfectly right. She knew that, spiritually, she was right. In\nher own infallible purity, she had done what must be done. She was\nright, she was pure. A drugged, almost sinister religious expression\nbecame permanent on her face.\n\nBirkin, barely conscious, and yet perfectly direct in his motion, went\nout of the house and straight across the park, to the open country, to\nthe hills. The brilliant day had become overcast, spots of rain were\nfalling. He wandered on to a wild valley-side, where were thickets of\nhazel, many flowers, tufts of heather, and little clumps of young\nfir-trees, budding with soft paws. It was rather wet everywhere, there\nwas a stream running down at the bottom of the valley, which was\ngloomy, or seemed gloomy. He was aware that he could not regain his\nconsciousness, that he was moving in a sort of darkness.\n\nYet he wanted something. He was happy in the wet hillside, that was\novergrown and obscure with bushes and flowers. He wanted to touch them\nall, to saturate himself with the touch of them all. He took off his\nclothes, and sat down naked among the primroses, moving his feet softly\namong the primroses, his legs, his knees, his arms right up to the\narm-pits, lying down and letting them touch his belly, his breasts. It\nwas such a fine, cool, subtle touch all over him, he seemed to saturate\nhimself with their contact.\n\nBut they were too soft. He went through the long grass to a clump of\nyoung fir-trees, that were no higher than a man. The soft sharp boughs\nbeat upon him, as he moved in keen pangs against them, threw little\ncold showers of drops on his belly, and beat his loins with their\nclusters of soft-sharp needles. There was a thistle which pricked him\nvividly, but not too much, because all his movements were too\ndiscriminate and soft. To lie down and roll in the sticky, cool young\nhyacinths, to lie on one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s belly and cover one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s back with handfuls of\nfine wet grass, soft as a breath, soft and more delicate and more\nbeautiful than the touch of any woman; and then to sting one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s thigh\nagainst the living dark bristles of the fir-boughs; and then to feel\nthe light whip of the hazel on one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulders, stinging, and then to\nclasp the silvery birch-trunk against one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s breast, its smoothness, its\nhardness, its vital knots and ridges\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094this was good, this was all very\ngood, very satisfying. Nothing else would do, nothing else would\nsatisfy, except this coolness and subtlety of vegetation travelling\ninto one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood. How fortunate he was, that there was this lovely,\nsubtle, responsive vegetation, waiting for him, as he waited for it;\nhow fulfilled he was, how happy!\n\nAs he dried himself a little with his handkerchief, he thought about\nHermione and the blow. He could feel a pain on the side of his head.\nBut after all, what did it matter? What did Hermione matter, what did\npeople matter altogether? There was this perfect cool loneliness, so\nlovely and fresh and unexplored. Really, what a mistake he had made,\nthinking he wanted people, thinking he wanted a woman. He did not want\na woman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not in the least. The leaves and the primroses and the trees,\nthey were really lovely and cool and desirable, they really came into\nthe blood and were added on to him. He was enrichened now immeasurably,\nand so glad.\n\nIt was quite right of Hermione to want to kill him. What had he to do\nwith her? Why should he pretend to have anything to do with human\nbeings at all? Here was his world, he wanted nobody and nothing but the\nlovely, subtle, responsive vegetation, and himself, his own living\nself.\n\nIt was necessary to go back into the world. That was true. But that did\nnot matter, so one knew where one belonged. He knew now where he\nbelonged. This was his place, his marriage place. The world was\nextraneous.\n\nHe climbed out of the valley, wondering if he were mad. But if so, he\npreferred his own madness, to the regular sanity. He rejoiced in his\nown madness, he was free. He did not want that old sanity of the world,\nwhich was become so repulsive. He rejoiced in the new-found world of\nhis madness. It was so fresh and delicate and so satisfying.\n\nAs for the certain grief he felt at the same time, in his soul, that\nwas only the remains of an old ethic, that bade a human being adhere to\nhumanity. But he was weary of the old ethic, of the human being, and of\nhumanity. He loved now the soft, delicate vegetation, that was so cool\nand perfect. He would overlook the old grief, he would put away the old\nethic, he would be free in his new state.\n\nHe was aware of the pain in his head becoming more and more difficult\nevery minute. He was walking now along the road to the nearest station.\nIt was raining and he had no hat. But then plenty of cranks went out\nnowadays without hats, in the rain.\n\nHe wondered again how much of his heaviness of heart, a certain\ndepression, was due to fear, fear lest anybody should have seen him\nnaked lying against the vegetation. What a dread he had of mankind, of\nother people! It amounted almost to horror, to a sort of dream\nterror\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094his horror of being observed by some other people. If he were on\nan island, like Alexander Selkirk, with only the creatures and the\ntrees, he would be free and glad, there would be none of this\nheaviness, this misgiving. He could love the vegetation and be quite\nhappy and unquestioned, by himself.\n\nHe had better send a note to Hermione: she might trouble about him, and\nhe did not want the onus of this. So at the station, he wrote saying:\n\n\nI will go on to town\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to come back to Breadalby for the\npresent. But it is quite all right\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want you to mind having\nbiffed me, in the least. Tell the others it is just one of my moods.\nYou were quite right, to biff me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094because I know you wanted to. So\nthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the end of it.\n\n\nIn the train, however, he felt ill. Every motion was insufferable pain,\nand he was sick. He dragged himself from the station into a cab,\nfeeling his way step by step, like a blind man, and held up only by a\ndim will.\n\nFor a week or two he was ill, but he did not let Hermione know, and she\nthought he was sulking; there was a complete estrangement between them.\nShe became rapt, abstracted in her conviction of exclusive\nrighteousness. She lived in and by her own self-esteem, conviction of\nher own rightness of spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER IX.\n\n\n COAL-DUST\n\nGoing home from school in the afternoon, the Brangwen girls descended\nthe hill between the picturesque cottages of Willey Green till they\ncame to the railway crossing. There they found the gate shut, because\nthe colliery train was rumbling nearer. They could hear the small\nlocomotive panting hoarsely as it advanced with caution between the\nembankments. The one-legged man in the little signal-hut by the road\nstared out from his security, like a crab from a snail-shell.\n\nWhilst the two girls waited, Gerald Crich trotted up on a red Arab\nmare. He rode well and softly, pleased with the delicate quivering of\nthe creature between his knees. And he was very picturesque, at least\nin Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes, sitting soft and close on the slender red mare, whose\nlong tail flowed on the air. He saluted the two girls, and drew up at\nthe crossing to wait for the gate, looking down the railway for the\napproaching train. In spite of her ironic smile at his picturesqueness,\nGudrun liked to look at him. He was well-set and easy, his face with\nits warm tan showed up his whitish, coarse moustache, and his blue eyes\nwere full of sharp light as he watched the distance.\n\nThe locomotive chuffed slowly between the banks, hidden. The mare did\nnot like it. She began to wince away, as if hurt by the unknown noise.\nBut Gerald pulled her back and held her head to the gate. The sharp\nblasts of the chuffing engine broke with more and more force on her.\nThe repeated sharp blows of unknown, terrifying noise struck through\nher till she was rocking with terror. She recoiled like a spring let\ngo. But a glistening, half-smiling look came into Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face. He\nbrought her back again, inevitably.\n\nThe noise was released, the little locomotive with her clanking steel\nconnecting-rod emerged on the highroad, clanking sharply. The mare\nrebounded like a drop of water from hot iron. Ursula and Gudrun pressed\nback into the hedge, in fear. But Gerald was heavy on the mare, and\nforced her back. It seemed as if he sank into her magnetically, and\ncould thrust her back against herself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe fool!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula loudly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he ride away till it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ngone by?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun was looking at him with black-dilated, spellbound eyes. But he\nsat glistening and obstinate, forcing the wheeling mare, which spun and\nswerved like a wind, and yet could not get out of the grasp of his\nwill, nor escape from the mad clamour of terror that resounded through\nher, as the trucks thumped slowly, heavily, horrifying, one after the\nother, one pursuing the other, over the rails of the crossing.\n\nThe locomotive, as if wanting to see what could be done, put on the\nbrakes, and back came the trucks rebounding on the iron buffers,\nstriking like horrible cymbals, clashing nearer and nearer in frightful\nstrident concussions. The mare opened her mouth and rose slowly, as if\nlifted up on a wind of terror. Then suddenly her fore feet struck out,\nas she convulsed herself utterly away from the horror. Back she went,\nand the two girls clung to each other, feeling she must fall backwards\non top of him. But he leaned forward, his face shining with fixed\namusement, and at last he brought her down, sank her down, and was\nbearing her back to the mark. But as strong as the pressure of his\ncompulsion was the repulsion of her utter terror, throwing her back\naway from the railway, so that she spun round and round, on two legs,\nas if she were in the centre of some whirlwind. It made Gudrun faint\nwith poignant dizziness, which seemed to penetrate to her heart.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094! No\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094! Let her go! Let her go, you fool, you _fool_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula\nat the top of her voice, completely outside herself. And Gudrun hated\nher bitterly for being outside herself. It was unendurable that\nUrsula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice was so powerful and naked.\n\nA sharpened look came on Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face. He bit himself down on the mare\nlike a keen edge biting home, and _forced_ her round. She roared as she\nbreathed, her nostrils were two wide, hot holes, her mouth was apart,\nher eyes frenzied. It was a repulsive sight. But he held on her\nunrelaxed, with an almost mechanical relentlessness, keen as a sword\npressing in to her. Both man and horse were sweating with violence. Yet\nhe seemed calm as a ray of cold sunshine.\n\nMeanwhile the eternal trucks were rumbling on, very slowly, treading\none after the other, one after the other, like a disgusting dream that\nhas no end. The connecting chains were grinding and squeaking as the\ntension varied, the mare pawed and struck away mechanically now, her\nterror fulfilled in her, for now the man encompassed her; her paws were\nblind and pathetic as she beat the air, the man closed round her, and\nbrought her down, almost as if she were part of his own physique.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bleeding! She\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bleeding!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, frantic with\nopposition and hatred of Gerald. She alone understood him perfectly, in\npure opposition.\n\nGudrun looked and saw the trickles of blood on the sides of the mare,\nand she turned white. And then on the very wound the bright spurs came\ndown, pressing relentlessly. The world reeled and passed into\nnothingness for Gudrun, she could not know any more.\n\nWhen she recovered, her soul was calm and cold, without feeling. The\ntrucks were still rumbling by, and the man and the mare were still\nfighting. But she herself was cold and separate, she had no more\nfeeling for them. She was quite hard and cold and indifferent.\n\nThey could see the top of the hooded guard\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s-van approaching, the sound\nof the trucks was diminishing, there was hope of relief from the\nintolerable noise. The heavy panting of the half-stunned mare sounded\nautomatically, the man seemed to be relaxing confidently, his will\nbright and unstained. The guard\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s-van came up, and passed slowly, the\nguard staring out in his transition on the spectacle in the road. And,\nthrough the man in the closed wagon, Gudrun could see the whole scene\nspectacularly, isolated and momentary, like a vision isolated in\neternity.\n\nLovely, grateful silence seemed to trail behind the receding train. How\nsweet the silence is! Ursula looked with hatred on the buffers of the\ndiminishing wagon. The gatekeeper stood ready at the door of his hut,\nto proceed to open the gate. But Gudrun sprang suddenly forward, in\nfront of the struggling horse, threw off the latch and flung the gates\nasunder, throwing one-half to the keeper, and running with the other\nhalf, forwards. Gerald suddenly let go the horse and leaped forwards,\nalmost on to Gudrun. She was not afraid. As he jerked aside the mare\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nhead, Gudrun cried, in a strange, high voice, like a gull, or like a\nwitch screaming out from the side of the road:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI should think you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re proud.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe words were distinct and formed. The man, twisting aside on his\ndancing horse, looked at her in some surprise, some wondering interest.\nThen the mare\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hoofs had danced three times on the drum-like sleepers\nof the crossing, and man and horse were bounding springily, unequally\nup the road.\n\nThe two girls watched them go. The gate-keeper hobbled thudding over\nthe logs of the crossing, with his wooden leg. He had fastened the\ngate. Then he also turned, and called to the girls:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA masterful young jockey, that; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have his own road, if ever anybody\nwould.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, in her hot, overbearing voice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he\ntake the horse away, till the trucks had gone by? He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a fool, and a\nbully. Does he think it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s manly, to torture a horse? It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a living\nthing, why should he bully it and torture it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a pause, then the gate-keeper shook his head, and replied:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s as nice a little mare as you could set eyes on\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094beautiful\nlittle thing, beautiful. Now you couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see his father treat any\nanimal like that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not you. They\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re as different as they welly can be,\nGerald Crich and his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094two different men, different made.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThen there was a pause.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why does he do it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhy does he? Does he think he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ngrand, when he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bullied a sensitive creature, ten times as sensitive\nas himself?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain there was a cautious pause. Then again the man shook his head, as\nif he would say nothing, but would think the more.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI expect he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s got to train the mare to stand to anything,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA pure-bred Harab\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not the sort of breed as is used to round\nhere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094different sort from our sort altogether. They say as he got her\nfrom Constantinople.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe would!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better have left her to the Turks, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m\nsure they would have had more decency towards her.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe man went in to drink his can of tea, the girls went on down the\nlane, that was deep in soft black dust. Gudrun was as if numbed in her\nmind by the sense of indomitable soft weight of the man, bearing down\ninto the living body of the horse: the strong, indomitable thighs of\nthe blond man clenching the palpitating body of the mare into pure\ncontrol; a sort of soft white magnetic domination from the loins and\nthighs and calves, enclosing and encompassing the mare heavily into\nunutterable subordination, soft blood-subordination, terrible.\n\nOn the left, as the girls walked silently, the coal-mine lifted its\ngreat mounds and its patterned head-stocks, the black railway with the\ntrucks at rest looked like a harbour just below, a large bay of\nrailroad with anchored wagons.\n\nNear the second level-crossing, that went over many bright rails, was a\nfarm belonging to the collieries, and a great round globe of iron, a\ndisused boiler, huge and rusty and perfectly round, stood silently in a\npaddock by the road. The hens were pecking round it, some chickens were\nbalanced on the drinking trough, wagtails flew away in among trucks,\nfrom the water.\n\nOn the other side of the wide crossing, by the road-side, was a heap of\npale-grey stones for mending the roads, and a cart standing, and a\nmiddle-aged man with whiskers round his face was leaning on his shovel,\ntalking to a young man in gaiters, who stood by the horse\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s head. Both\nmen were facing the crossing.\n\nThey saw the two girls appear, small, brilliant figures in the near\ndistance, in the strong light of the late afternoon. Both wore light,\ngay summer dresses, Ursula had an orange-coloured knitted coat, Gudrun\na pale yellow, Ursula wore canary yellow stockings, Gudrun bright rose,\nthe figures of the two women seemed to glitter in progress over the\nwide bay of the railway crossing, white and orange and yellow and rose\nglittering in motion across a hot world silted with coal-dust.\n\nThe two men stood quite still in the heat, watching. The elder was a\nshort, hard-faced energetic man of middle age, the younger a labourer\nof twenty-three or so. They stood in silence watching the advance of\nthe sisters. They watched whilst the girls drew near, and whilst they\npassed, and whilst they receded down the dusty road, that had dwellings\non one side, and dusty young corn on the other.\n\nThen the elder man, with the whiskers round his face, said in a\nprurient manner to the young man:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat price that, eh? She\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll do, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t she?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhich?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked the young man, eagerly, with a laugh.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHer with the red stockings. What d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099you say? I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d give my week\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wages\nfor five minutes; what!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094just for five minutes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain the young man laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYour missis \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ud have summat to say to you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nGudrun had turned round and looked at the two men. They were to her\nsinister creatures, standing watching after her, by the heap of pale\ngrey slag. She loathed the man with whiskers round his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re first class, you are,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d the man said to her, and to the\ndistance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think it would be worth a week\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wages?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the younger man,\nmusing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo I? I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d put \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099em bloody-well down this second\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe younger man looked after Gudrun and Ursula objectively, as if he\nwished to calculate what there might be, that was worth his week\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nwages. He shook his head with fatal misgiving.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not worth that to me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the old man. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBy God, if it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t to me!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd he went on shovelling his stones.\n\nThe girls descended between the houses with slate roofs and blackish\nbrick walls. The heavy gold glamour of approaching sunset lay over all\nthe colliery district, and the ugliness overlaid with beauty was like a\nnarcotic to the senses. On the roads silted with black dust, the rich\nlight fell more warmly, more heavily, over all the amorphous squalor a\nkind of magic was cast, from the glowing close of day.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt has a foul kind of beauty, this place,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, evidently\nsuffering from fascination. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you feel in some way, a thick, hot\nattraction in it? I can. And it quite stupifies me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey were passing between blocks of miners\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 dwellings. In the back\nyards of several dwellings, a miner could be seen washing himself in\nthe open on this hot evening, naked down to the loins, his great\ntrousers of moleskin slipping almost away. Miners already cleaned were\nsitting on their heels, with their backs near the walls, talking and\nsilent in pure physical well-being, tired, and taking physical rest.\nTheir voices sounded out with strong intonation, and the broad dialect\nwas curiously caressing to the blood. It seemed to envelop Gudrun in a\nlabourer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s caress, there was in the whole atmosphere a resonance of\nphysical men, a glamorous thickness of labour and maleness, surcharged\nin the air. But it was universal in the district, and therefore\nunnoticed by the inhabitants.\n\nTo Gudrun, however, it was potent and half-repulsive. She could never\ntell why Beldover was so utterly different from London and the south,\nwhy one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s whole feelings were different, why one seemed to live in\nanother sphere. Now she realised that this was the world of powerful,\nunderworld men who spent most of their time in the darkness. In their\nvoices she could hear the voluptuous resonance of darkness, the strong,\ndangerous underworld, mindless, inhuman. They sounded also like strange\nmachines, heavy, oiled. The voluptuousness was like that of machinery,\ncold and iron.\n\nIt was the same every evening when she came home, she seemed to move\nthrough a wave of disruptive force, that was given off from the\npresence of thousands of vigorous, underworld, half-automatised\ncolliers, and which went to the brain and the heart, awaking a fatal\ndesire, and a fatal callousness.\n\nThere came over her a nostalgia for the place. She hated it, she knew\nhow utterly cut off it was, how hideous and how sickeningly mindless.\nSometimes she beat her wings like a new Daphne, turning not into a tree\nbut a machine. And yet, she was overcome by the nostalgia. She\nstruggled to get more and more into accord with the atmosphere of the\nplace, she craved to get her satisfaction of it.\n\nShe felt herself drawn out at evening into the main street of the town,\nthat was uncreated and ugly, and yet surcharged with this same potent\natmosphere of intense, dark callousness. There were always miners\nabout. They moved with their strange, distorted dignity, a certain\nbeauty, and unnatural stillness in their bearing, a look of abstraction\nand half resignation in their pale, often gaunt faces. They belonged to\nanother world, they had a strange glamour, their voices were full of an\nintolerable deep resonance, like a machine\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s burring, a music more\nmaddening than the siren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s long ago.\n\nShe found herself, with the rest of the common women, drawn out on\nFriday evenings to the little market. Friday was pay-day for the\ncolliers, and Friday night was market night. Every woman was abroad,\nevery man was out, shopping with his wife, or gathering with his pals.\nThe pavements were dark for miles around with people coming in, the\nlittle market-place on the crown of the hill, and the main street of\nBeldover were black with thickly-crowded men and women.\n\nIt was dark, the market-place was hot with kerosene flares, which threw\na ruddy light on the grave faces of the purchasing wives, and on the\npale abstract faces of the men. The air was full of the sound of criers\nand of people talking, thick streams of people moved on the pavements\ntowards the solid crowd of the market. The shops were blazing and\npacked with women, in the streets were men, mostly men, miners of all\nages. Money was spent with almost lavish freedom.\n\nThe carts that came could not pass through. They had to wait, the\ndriver calling and shouting, till the dense crowd would make way.\nEverywhere, young fellows from the outlying districts were making\nconversation with the girls, standing in the road and at the corners.\nThe doors of the public-houses were open and full of light, men passed\nin and out in a continual stream, everywhere men were calling out to\none another, or crossing to meet one another, or standing in little\ngangs and circles, discussing, endlessly discussing. The sense of talk,\nbuzzing, jarring, half-secret, the endless mining and political\nwrangling, vibrated in the air like discordant machinery. And it was\ntheir voices which affected Gudrun almost to swooning. They aroused a\nstrange, nostalgic ache of desire, something almost demoniacal, never\nto be fulfilled.\n\nLike any other common girl of the district, Gudrun strolled up and\ndown, up and down the length of the brilliant two-hundred paces of the\npavement nearest the market-place. She knew it was a vulgar thing to\ndo; her father and mother could not bear it; but the nostalgia came\nover her, she must be among the people. Sometimes she sat among the\nlouts in the cinema: rakish-looking, unattractive louts they were. Yet\nshe must be among them.\n\nAnd, like any other common lass, she found her \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098boy.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 It was an\nelectrician, one of the electricians introduced according to Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nnew scheme. He was an earnest, clever man, a scientist with a passion\nfor sociology. He lived alone in a cottage, in lodgings, in Willey\nGreen. He was a gentleman, and sufficiently well-to-do. His landlady\nspread the reports about him; he _would_ have a large wooden tub in his\nbedroom, and every time he came in from work, he _would_ have pails and\npails of water brought up, to bathe in, then he put on clean shirt and\nunder-clothing _every_ day, and clean silk socks; fastidious and\nexacting he was in these respects, but in every other way, most\nordinary and unassuming.\n\nGudrun knew all these things. The Brangwen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s house was one to which the\ngossip came naturally and inevitably. Palmer was in the first place a\nfriend of Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. But in his pale, elegant, serious face there showed\nthe same nostalgia that Gudrun felt. He too must walk up and down the\nstreet on Friday evening. So he walked with Gudrun, and a friendship\nwas struck up between them. But he was not in love with Gudrun; he\n_really_ wanted Ursula, but for some strange reason, nothing could\nhappen between her and him. He liked to have Gudrun about, as a\nfellow-mind\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but that was all. And she had no real feeling for him. He\nwas a scientist, he had to have a woman to back him. But he was really\nimpersonal, he had the fineness of an elegant piece of machinery. He\nwas too cold, too destructive to care really for women, too great an\negoist. He was polarised by the men. Individually he detested and\ndespised them. In the mass they fascinated him, as machinery fascinated\nhim. They were a new sort of machinery to him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but incalculable,\nincalculable.\n\nSo Gudrun strolled the streets with Palmer, or went to the cinema with\nhim. And his long, pale, rather elegant face flickered as he made his\nsarcastic remarks. There they were, the two of them: two elegants in\none sense: in the other sense, two units, absolutely adhering to the\npeople, teeming with the distorted colliers. The same secret seemed to\nbe working in the souls of all alike, Gudrun, Palmer, the rakish young\nbloods, the gaunt, middle-aged men. All had a secret sense of power,\nand of inexpressible destructiveness, and of fatal half-heartedness, a\nsort of rottenness in the will.\n\nSometimes Gudrun would start aside, see it all, see how she was sinking\nin. And then she was filled with a fury of contempt and anger. She felt\nshe was sinking into one mass with the rest\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094all so close and\nintermingled and breathless. It was horrible. She stifled. She prepared\nfor flight, feverishly she flew to her work. But soon she let go. She\nstarted off into the country\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the darkish, glamorous country. The spell\nwas beginning to work again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER X.\n\n\n SKETCH-BOOK\n\nOne morning the sisters were sketching by the side of Willey Water, at\nthe remote end of the lake. Gudrun had waded out to a gravelly shoal,\nand was seated like a Buddhist, staring fixedly at the water-plants\nthat rose succulent from the mud of the low shores. What she could see\nwas mud, soft, oozy, watery mud, and from its festering chill,\nwater-plants rose up, thick and cool and fleshy, very straight and\nturgid, thrusting out their leaves at right angles, and having dark\nlurid colours, dark green and blotches of black-purple and bronze. But\nshe could feel their turgid fleshy structure as in a sensuous vision,\nshe _knew_ how they rose out of the mud, she _knew_ how they thrust out\nfrom themselves, how they stood stiff and succulent against the air.\n\nUrsula was watching the butterflies, of which there were dozens near\nthe water, little blue ones suddenly snapping out of nothingness into a\njewel-life, a large black-and-red one standing upon a flower and\nbreathing with his soft wings, intoxicatingly, breathing pure, ethereal\nsunshine; two white ones wrestling in the low air; there was a halo\nround them; ah, when they came tumbling nearer they were orangetips,\nand it was the orange that had made the halo. Ursula rose and drifted\naway, unconscious like the butterflies.\n\nGudrun, absorbed in a stupor of apprehension of surging water-plants,\nsat crouched on the shoal, drawing, not looking up for a long time, and\nthen staring unconsciously, absorbedly at the rigid, naked, succulent\nstems. Her feet were bare, her hat lay on the bank opposite.\n\nShe started out of her trance, hearing the knocking of oars. She looked\nround. There was a boat with a gaudy Japanese parasol, and a man in\nwhite, rowing. The woman was Hermione, and the man was Gerald. She knew\nit instantly. And instantly she perished in the keen _frisson_ of\nanticipation, an electric vibration in her veins, intense, much more\nintense than that which was always humming low in the atmosphere of\nBeldover.\n\nGerald was her escape from the heavy slough of the pale, underworld,\nautomatic colliers. He started out of the mud. He was master. She saw\nhis back, the movement of his white loins. But not that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was the\nwhiteness he seemed to enclose as he bent forwards, rowing. He seemed\nto stoop to something. His glistening, whitish hair seemed like the\nelectricity of the sky.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Gudrun,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice floating distinct over the\nwater. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will go and speak to her. Do you mind?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked round and saw the girl standing by the water\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s edge,\nlooking at him. He pulled the boat towards her, magnetically, without\nthinking of her. In his world, his conscious world, she was still\nnobody. He knew that Hermione had a curious pleasure in treading down\nall the social differences, at least apparently, and he left it to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do, Gudrun?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, using the Christian name in the\nfashionable manner. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are you doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do, Hermione? I _was_ sketching.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWere you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The boat drifted nearer, till the keel ground on the bank.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMay we see? I should like to _so_ much.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was no use resisting Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s deliberate intention.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun reluctantly, for she always hated to have her\nunfinished work exposed\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nothing in the least interesting.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t there? But let me see, will you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun reached out the sketch-book, Gerald stretched from the boat to\ntake it. And as he did so, he remembered Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s last words to him,\nand her face lifted up to him as he sat on the swerving horse. An\nintensification of pride went over his nerves, because he felt, in some\nway she was compelled by him. The exchange of feeling between them was\nstrong and apart from their consciousness.\n\nAnd as if in a spell, Gudrun was aware of his body, stretching and\nsurging like the marsh-fire, stretching towards her, his hand coming\nstraight forward like a stem. Her voluptuous, acute apprehension of him\nmade the blood faint in her veins, her mind went dim and unconscious.\nAnd he rocked on the water perfectly, like the rocking of\nphosphorescence. He looked round at the boat. It was drifting off a\nlittle. He lifted the oar to bring it back. And the exquisite pleasure\nof slowly arresting the boat, in the heavy-soft water, was complete as\na swoon.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s_ what you have done,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, looking searchingly at\nthe plants on the shore, and comparing with Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s drawing. Gudrun\nlooked round in the direction of Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s long, pointing finger.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is it, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Hermione, needing confirmation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun automatically, taking no real heed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet me look,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, reaching forward for the book. But Hermione\nignored him, he must not presume, before she had finished. But he, his\nwill as unthwarted and as unflinching as hers, stretched forward till\nhe touched the book. A little shock, a storm of revulsion against him,\nshook Hermione unconsciously. She released the book when he had not\nproperly got it, and it tumbled against the side of the boat and\nbounced into the water.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, with a strange ring of malevolent victory. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m\nso sorry, so awfully sorry. Can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you get it, Gerald?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThis last was said in a note of anxious sneering that made Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nveins tingle with fine hate for her. He leaned far out of the boat,\nreaching down into the water. He could feel his position was\nridiculous, his loins exposed behind him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is of no importance,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the strong, clanging voice of Gudrun.\nShe seemed to touch him. But he reached further, the boat swayed\nviolently. Hermione, however, remained unperturbed. He grasped the\nbook, under the water, and brought it up, dripping.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so dreadfully sorry\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094dreadfully sorry,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Hermione. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m\nafraid it was all my fault.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s of no importance\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094really, I assure you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter in the\nleast,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun loudly, with emphasis, her face flushed scarlet.\nAnd she held out her hand impatiently for the wet book, to have done\nwith the scene. Gerald gave it to her. He was not quite himself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so dreadfully sorry,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Hermione, till both Gerald and\nGudrun were exasperated. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs there nothing that can be done?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn what way?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun, with cool irony.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t we save the drawings?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a moment\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s pause, wherein Gudrun made evident all her\nrefutation of Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s persistence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI assure you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, with cutting distinctness, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthe drawings\nare quite as good as ever they were, for my purpose. I want them only\nfor reference.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t I give you a new book? I wish you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d let me do that. I feel\nso truly sorry. I feel it was all my fault.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAs far as I saw,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t your fault at all. If there\nwas any _fault_, it was Mr Crich\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. But the whole thing is _entirely_\ntrivial, and it really is ridiculous to take any notice of it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald watched Gudrun closely, whilst she repulsed Hermione. There was\na body of cold power in her. He watched her with an insight that\namounted to clairvoyance. He saw her a dangerous, hostile spirit, that\ncould stand undiminished and unabated. It was so finished, and of such\nperfect gesture, moreover.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m awfully glad if it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cif there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no real\nharm done.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked back at him, with her fine blue eyes, and signalled full\ninto his spirit, as she said, her voice ringing with intimacy almost\ncaressive now it was addressed to him:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course, it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter in the _least_.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe bond was established between them, in that look, in her tone. In\nher tone, she made the understanding clear\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they were of the same kind,\nhe and she, a sort of diabolic freemasonry subsisted between them.\nHenceforward, she knew, she had her power over him. Wherever they met,\nthey would be secretly associated. And he would be helpless in the\nassociation with her. Her soul exulted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye! I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m so glad you forgive me. Gooood-bye!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione sang her farewell, and waved her hand. Gerald automatically\ntook the oar and pushed off. But he was looking all the time, with a\nglimmering, subtly-smiling admiration in his eyes, at Gudrun, who stood\non the shoal shaking the wet book in her hand. She turned away and\nignored the receding boat. But Gerald looked back as he rowed,\nbeholding her, forgetting what he was doing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t we going too much to the left?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, as she sat\nignored under her coloured parasol.\n\nGerald looked round without replying, the oars balanced and glancing in\nthe sun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said good-humouredly, beginning to row\nagain without thinking of what he was doing. And Hermione disliked him\nextremely for his good-humoured obliviousness, she was nullified, she\ncould not regain ascendancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XI.\n\n\n AN ISLAND\n\nMeanwhile Ursula had wandered on from Willey Water along the course of\nthe bright little stream. The afternoon was full of larks\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 singing. On\nthe bright hill-sides was a subdued smoulder of gorse. A few\nforget-me-nots flowered by the water. There was a rousedness and a\nglancing everywhere.\n\nShe strayed absorbedly on, over the brooks. She wanted to go to the\nmill-pond above. The big mill-house was deserted, save for a labourer\nand his wife who lived in the kitchen. So she passed through the empty\nfarm-yard and through the wilderness of a garden, and mounted the bank\nby the sluice. When she got to the top, to see the old, velvety surface\nof the pond before her, she noticed a man on the bank, tinkering with a\npunt. It was Birkin sawing and hammering away.\n\nShe stood at the head of the sluice, looking at him. He was unaware of\nanybody\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence. He looked very busy, like a wild animal, active and\nintent. She felt she ought to go away, he would not want her. He seemed\nto be so much occupied. But she did not want to go away. Therefore she\nmoved along the bank till he would look up.\n\nWhich he soon did. The moment he saw her, he dropped his tools and came\nforward, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do? I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m making the punt water-tight. Tell me if you think\nit is right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe went along with him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are your father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s daughter, so you can tell me if it will do,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\nsaid.\n\nShe bent to look at the patched punt.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am sure I am my father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s daughter,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, fearful of having to\njudge. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know anything about carpentry. It _looks_ right,\ndon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I think. I hope it won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t let me to the bottom, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all. Though\neven so, it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a great matter, I should come up again. Help me to\nget it into the water, will you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWith combined efforts they turned over the heavy punt and set it\nafloat.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll try it and you can watch what happens. Then if it\ncarries, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll take you over to the island.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, watching anxiously.\n\nThe pond was large, and had that perfect stillness and the dark lustre\nof very deep water. There were two small islands overgrown with bushes\nand a few trees, towards the middle. Birkin pushed himself off, and\nveered clumsily in the pond. Luckily the punt drifted so that he could\ncatch hold of a willow bough, and pull it to the island.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRather overgrown,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, looking into the interior, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbut very nice.\nI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll come and fetch you. The boat leaks a little.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIn a moment he was with her again, and she stepped into the wet punt.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll float us all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, and man\u00c3\u0085\u00c2\u0093uvred again to the island.\n\nThey landed under a willow tree. She shrank from the little jungle of\nrank plants before her, evil-smelling figwort and hemlock. But he\nexplored into it.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall mow this down,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand then it will be romantic\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094like\nPaul et Virginie.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, one could have lovely Watteau picnics here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula with\nenthusiasm.\n\nHis face darkened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want Watteau picnics here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOnly your Virginie,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVirginie enough,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he smiled wryly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want her either.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula looked at him closely. She had not seen him since Breadalby. He\nwas very thin and hollow, with a ghastly look in his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou have been ill; haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, rather repulsed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied coldly.\n\nThey had sat down under the willow tree, and were looking at the pond,\nfrom their retreat on the island.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHas it made you frightened?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat of?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, turning his eyes to look at her. Something in him,\ninhuman and unmitigated, disturbed her, and shook her out of her\nordinary self.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt _is_ frightening to be very ill, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t pleasant,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhether one is really afraid of death,\nor not, I have never decided. In one mood, not a bit, in another, very\nmuch.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it make you feel ashamed? I think it makes one so ashamed,\nto be ill\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094illness is so terribly humiliating, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe considered for some minutes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMaybe,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThough one knows all the time one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s life isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nreally right, at the source. That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the humiliation. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see that\nthe illness counts so much, after that. One is ill because one doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nlive properly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the failure to live that makes one ill, and\nhumiliates one.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut do you fail to live?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, almost jeering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy yes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t make much of a success of my days. One seems always to\nbe bumping one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nose against the blank wall ahead.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula laughed. She was frightened, and when she was frightened she\nalways laughed and pretended to be jaunty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYour poor nose!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, looking at that feature of his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo wonder it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ugly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nShe was silent for some minutes, struggling with her own\nself-deception. It was an instinct in her, to deceive herself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut _I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m_ happy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I think life is _awfully_ jolly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, with a certain cold indifference.\n\nShe reached for a bit of paper which had wrapped a small piece of\nchocolate she had found in her pocket, and began making a boat. He\nwatched her without heeding her. There was something strangely pathetic\nand tender in her moving, unconscious finger-tips, that were agitated\nand hurt, really.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI _do_ enjoy things\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes! But it infuriates me that I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t get right, at the really\ngrowing part of me. I feel all tangled and messed up, and I _can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ get\nstraight anyhow. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know what really to _do_.

I\nthink it is much better to be really patrician, and to do nothing but\njust be oneself, like a walking flower.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI quite agree,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cif one has burst into blossom. But I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nget my flower to blossom anyhow. Either it is blighted in the bud, or\nhas got the smother-fly, or it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t nourished. Curse it, it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t even\na bud. It is a contravened knot.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain she laughed. He was so very fretful and exasperated. But she was\nanxious and puzzled. How was one to get out, anyhow. There must be a\nway out somewhere.\n\nThere was a silence, wherein she wanted to cry. She reached for another\nbit of chocolate paper, and began to fold another boat.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd why is it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked at length, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat there is no flowering, no\ndignity of human life now?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe whole idea is dead.

But mankind is a dead tree, covered\nwith fine brilliant galls of people.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula could not help stiffening herself against this, it was too\npicturesque and final. But neither could she help making him go on.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd if it is so, _why_ is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, hostile. They were rousing\neach other to a fine passion of opposition.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy, why are people all balls of bitter dust? Because they won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t fall\noff the tree when they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re ripe. They hang on to their old positions\nwhen the position is over-past, till they become infested with little\nworms and dry-rot.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a long pause. His voice had become hot and very sarcastic.\nUrsula was troubled and bewildered, they were both oblivious of\neverything but their own immersion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut even if everybody is wrong\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094where are _you_ right?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhere are you any better?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried back. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAt least my only rightness lies in\nthe fact that I know it. I detest what I am, outwardly. I loathe myself\nas a human being. Humanity is a huge aggregate lie, and a huge lie is\nless than a small truth. Humanity is less, far less than the\nindividual, because the individual may sometimes be capable of truth,\nand humanity is a tree of lies. And they say that love is the greatest\nthing; they persist in _saying_ this, the foul liars, and just look at\nwhat they do! Look at all the millions of people who repeat every\nminute that love is the greatest, and charity is the greatest\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and see\nwhat they are doing all the time. By their works ye shall know them,\nfor dirty liars and cowards, who daren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stand by their own actions,\nmuch less by their own words.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula sadly, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t alter the fact that love is the\ngreatest, does it? What they _do_ doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t alter the truth of what they\nsay, does it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCompletely, because if what they say _were_ true, then they couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nhelp fulfilling it. But they maintain a lie, and so they run amok at\nlast. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a lie to say that love is the greatest. You might as well\nsay that hate is the greatest, since the opposite of everything\nbalances. What people want is hate\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094hate and nothing but hate. And in\nthe name of righteousness and love, they get it. They distil themselves\nwith nitroglycerine, all the lot of them, out of very love. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the\nlie that kills. If we want hate, let us have it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094death, murder, torture,\nviolent destruction\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094let us have it: but not in the name of love. But I\nabhor humanity, I wish it was swept away. It could go, and there would\nbe no _absolute_ loss, if every human being perished tomorrow. The\nreality would be untouched. Nay, it would be better. The real tree of\nlife would then be rid of the most ghastly, heavy crop of Dead Sea\nFruit, the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people, an\ninfinite weight of mortal lies.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d like everybody in the world destroyed?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI should indeed.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd the world empty of people?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes truly. You yourself, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you find it a beautiful clean thought,\na world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting\nup?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe pleasant sincerity of his voice made Ursula pause to consider her\nown proposition. And really it _was_ attractive: a clean, lovely,\nhumanless world. It was the _really_ desirable. Her heart hesitated,\nand exulted. But still, she was dissatisfied with _him_.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she objected, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d be dead yourself, so what good would it do\nyou?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI would die like a shot, to know that the earth would really be\ncleaned of all the people. It is the most beautiful and freeing\nthought. Then there would _never_ be another foul humanity created, for\na universal defilement.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere would be nothing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat! Nothing? Just because humanity was wiped out? You flatter\nyourself. There\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d be everything.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how, if there were no people?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think that creation depends on _man!_ It merely doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. There\nare the trees and the grass and birds. I much prefer to think of the\nlark rising up in the morning upon a humanless world. Man is a mistake,\nhe must go. There is the grass, and hares and adders, and the unseen\nhosts, actual angels that go about freely when a dirty humanity doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ninterrupt them\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and good pure-tissued demons: very nice.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt pleased Ursula, what he said, pleased her very much, as a phantasy.\nOf course it was only a pleasant fancy. She herself knew too well the\nactuality of humanity, its hideous actuality. She knew it could not\ndisappear so cleanly and conveniently. It had a long way to go yet, a\nlong and hideous way. Her subtle, feminine, demoniacal soul knew it\nwell.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf only man was swept off the face of the earth, creation would go on\nso marvellously, with a new start, non-human. Man is one of the\nmistakes of creation\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094like the ichthyosauri. If only he were gone again,\nthink what lovely things would come out of the liberated days;\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094things\nstraight out of the fire.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut man will never be gone,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with insidious, diabolical\nknowledge of the horrors of persistence. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe world will go with him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh no,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cnot so. I believe in the proud angels and the\ndemons that are our fore-runners. They will destroy us, because we are\nnot proud enough. The ichthyosauri were not proud: they crawled and\nfloundered as we do. And besides, look at elder-flowers and\nbluebells\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they are a sign that pure creation takes place\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094even the\nbutterfly. But humanity never gets beyond the caterpillar stage\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it rots\nin the chrysalis, it never will have wings. It is anti-creation, like\nmonkeys and baboons.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula watched him as he talked. There seemed a certain impatient fury\nin him, all the while, and at the same time a great amusement in\neverything, and a final tolerance. And it was this tolerance she\nmistrusted, not the fury. She saw that, all the while, in spite of\nhimself, he would have to be trying to save the world. And this\nknowledge, whilst it comforted her heart somewhere with a little\nself-satisfaction, stability, yet filled her with a certain sharp\ncontempt and hate of him. She wanted him to herself, she hated the\nSalvator Mundi touch. It was something diffuse and generalised about\nhim, which she could not stand. He would behave in the same way, say\nthe same things, give himself as completely to anybody who came along,\nanybody and everybody who liked to appeal to him. It was despicable, a\nvery insidious form of prostitution.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou believe in individual love, even if you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nbelieve in loving humanity\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe in love at all\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that is, any more than I believe in\nhate, or in grief. Love is one of the emotions like all the others\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and\nso it is all right whilst you feel it. But I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see how it becomes\nan absolute. It is just part of human relationships, no more. And it is\nonly part of _any_ human relationship. And why one should be required\n_always_ to feel it, any more than one always feels sorrow or distant\njoy, I cannot conceive. Love isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a desideratum\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is an emotion you\nfeel or you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t feel, according to circumstance.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen why do you care about people at all?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cif you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nbelieve in love? Why do you bother about humanity?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do I? Because I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t get away from it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause you love it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she persisted.\n\nIt irritated him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf I do love it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit is my disease.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut it is a disease you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to be cured of,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with\nsome cold sneering.\n\nHe was silent now, feeling she wanted to insult him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd if you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe in love, what _do_ you believe in?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked\nmocking. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSimply in the end of the world, and grass?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was beginning to feel a fool.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI believe in the unseen hosts,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd nothing else? You believe in nothing visible, except grass and\nbirds? Your world is a poor show.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps it is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, cool and superior now he was offended,\nassuming a certain insufferable aloof superiority, and withdrawing into\nhis distance.\n\nUrsula disliked him. But also she felt she had lost something. She\nlooked at him as he sat crouched on the bank. There was a certain\npriggish Sunday-school stiffness over him, priggish and detestable. And\nyet, at the same time, the moulding of him was so quick and attractive,\nit gave such a great sense of freedom: the moulding of his brows, his\nchin, his whole physique, something so alive, somewhere, in spite of\nthe look of sickness.\n\nAnd it was this duality in feeling which he created in her, that made a\nfine hate of him quicken in her bowels. There was his wonderful,\ndesirable life-rapidity, the rare quality of an utterly desirable man:\nand there was at the same time this ridiculous, mean effacement into a\nSalvator Mundi and a Sunday-school teacher, a prig of the stiffest\ntype.\n\nHe looked up at her. He saw her face strangely enkindled, as if\nsuffused from within by a powerful sweet fire. His soul was arrested in\nwonder. She was enkindled in her own living fire. Arrested in wonder\nand in pure, perfect attraction, he moved towards her. She sat like a\nstrange queen, almost supernatural in her glowing smiling richness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe point about love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, his consciousness quickly adjusting\nitself, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cis that we hate the word because we have vulgarised it. It\nought to be prescribed, tabooed from utterance, for many years, till we\nget a new, better idea.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a beam of understanding between them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut it always means the same thing,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh God, no, let it not mean that any more,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet the old\nmeanings go.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut still it is love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she persisted. A strange, wicked yellow light\nshone at him in her eyes.\n\nHe hesitated, baffled, withdrawing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.

She suddenly sprang up, turned her\nback to him, and walked away. He too rose slowly and went to the\nwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s edge, where, crouching, he began to amuse himself\nunconsciously. Picking a daisy he dropped it on the pond, so that the\nstem was a keel, the flower floated like a little water lily, staring\nwith its open face up to the sky. It turned slowly round, in a slow,\nslow Dervish dance, as it veered away.\n\nHe watched it, then dropped another daisy into the water, and after\nthat another, and sat watching them with bright, absolved eyes,\ncrouching near on the bank. Ursula turned to look. A strange feeling\npossessed her, as if something were taking place. But it was all\nintangible. And some sort of control was being put on her. She could\nnot know. She could only watch the brilliant little discs of the\ndaisies veering slowly in travel on the dark, lustrous water. The\nlittle flotilla was drifting into the light, a company of white specks\nin the distance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo let us go to the shore, to follow them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, afraid of being\nany longer imprisoned on the island. And they pushed off in the punt.\n\nShe was glad to be on the free land again. She went along the bank\ntowards the sluice. The daisies were scattered broadcast on the pond,\ntiny radiant things, like an exaltation, points of exaltation here and\nthere. Why did they move her so strongly and mystically?\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyour boat of purple paper is escorting them, and they\nare a convoy of rafts.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSome of the daisies came slowly towards her, hesitating, making a shy\nbright little cotillion on the dark clear water. Their gay bright\ncandour moved her so much as they came near, that she was almost in\ntears.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy are they so lovely,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do I think them so lovely?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey are nice flowers,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, her emotional tones putting a\nconstraint on him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou know that a daisy is a company of florets, a concourse, become\nindividual.

There were two bedrooms to correspond with the\nrooms downstairs. One of them was half furnished, and Birkin had\nevidently slept there. Hermione went round the room carefully, taking\nin every detail, as if absorbing the evidence of his presence, in all\nthe inanimate things. She felt the bed and examined the coverings.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you _sure_ you were quite comfortable?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, pressing the\npillow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerfectly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied coldly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd were you warm?

Ursula\nstood at the window and watched the woman carrying the tea up the bank\nto the pond. She hated the palaver Hermione made, she wanted to drink\ntea, she wanted anything but this fuss and business.\n\nAt last they all mounted the grassy bank, to the picnic. Hermione\npoured out tea. She ignored now Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence. And Ursula,\nrecovering from her ill-humour, turned to Gerald saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I hated you so much the other day, Mr Crich,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat for?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, wincing slightly away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFor treating your horse so badly. Oh, I hated you so much!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat did he do?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe made his lovely sensitive Arab horse stand with him at the\nrailway-crossing whilst a horrible lot of trucks went by; and the poor\nthing, she was in a perfect frenzy, a perfect agony. It was the most\nhorrible sight you can imagine.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy did you do it, Gerald?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Hermione, calm and interrogative.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe must learn to stand\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what use is she to me in this country, if she\nshies and goes off every time an engine whistles.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why inflict unnecessary torture?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy make her stand\nall that time at the crossing? You might just as well have ridden back\nup the road, and saved all that horror. Her sides were bleeding where\nyou had spurred her. It was too horrible\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald stiffened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have to use her,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd if I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going to be sure of her at\n_all_, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have to learn to stand noises.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should she?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in a passion. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe is a living creature,\nwhy should she stand anything, just because you choose to make her? She\nhas as much right to her own being, as you have to yours.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere I disagree,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI consider that mare is there for my\nuse. Not because I bought her, but because that is the natural order.\nIt is more natural for a man to take a horse and use it as he likes,\nthan for him to go down on his knees to it, begging it to do as it\nwishes, and to fulfil its own marvellous nature.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula was just breaking out, when Hermione lifted her face and began,\nin her musing sing-song:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI do think\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I do really think we must have the _courage_ to use the\nlower animal life for our needs. I do think there is something wrong,\nwhen we look on every living creature as if it were ourselves. I do\nfeel, that it is false to project our own feelings on every animate\ncreature. It is a lack of discrimination, a lack of criticism.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cQuite,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin sharply. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNothing is so detestable as the maudlin\nattributing of human feelings and consciousness to animals.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, wearily, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe must really take a position. Either\nwe are going to use the animals, or they will use us.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a fact,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA horse has got a will like a man,\nthough it has no _mind_ strictly. And if your will isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t master, then\nthe horse is master of you. And this is a thing I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t help. I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nhelp being master of the horse.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf only we could learn how to use our will,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe could\ndo anything. The will can cure anything, and put anything right. That I\nam convinced of\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if only we use the will properly, intelligibly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you mean by using the will properly?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA very great doctor taught me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, addressing Ursula and Gerald\nvaguely. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe told me for instance, that to cure oneself of a bad habit,\none should _force_ oneself to do it, when one would not do it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094make\noneself do it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and then the habit would disappear.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you mean?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf you bite your nails, for example. Then, when you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to bite\nyour nails, bite them, make yourself bite them. And you would find the\nhabit was broken.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs that so?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes. And in so many things, I have _made_ myself well. I was a very\nqueer and nervous girl. And by learning to use my will, simply by using\nmy will, I _made_ myself right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula looked all the while at Hermione, as she spoke in her slow,\ndispassionate, and yet strangely tense voice. A curious thrill went\nover the younger woman. Some strange, dark, convulsive power was in\nHermione, fascinating and repelling.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is fatal to use the will like that,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Birkin harshly,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdisgusting. Such a will is an obscenity.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione looked at him for a long time, with her shadowed, heavy eyes.\nHer face was soft and pale and thin, almost phosphorescent, her jaw was\nlean.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said at length. There always seemed an\ninterval, a strange split between what she seemed to feel and\nexperience, and what she actually said and thought. She seemed to catch\nher thoughts at length from off the surface of a maelstrom of chaotic\nblack emotions and reactions, and Birkin was always filled with\nrepulsion, she caught so infallibly, her will never failed her. Her\nvoice was always dispassionate and tense, and perfectly confident. Yet\nshe shuddered with a sense of nausea, a sort of seasickness that always\nthreatened to overwhelm her mind. But her mind remained unbroken, her\nwill was still perfect. It almost sent Birkin mad. But he would never,\nnever dare to break her will, and let loose the maelstrom of her\nsubconsciousness, and see her in her ultimate madness. Yet he was\nalways striking at her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd of course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chorses _haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ got a complete\nwill, like human beings. A horse has no _one_ will. Every horse,\nstrictly, has two wills. With one will, it wants to put itself in the\nhuman power completely\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and with the other, it wants to be free, wild.\nThe two wills sometimes lock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you know that, if ever you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve felt a horse\nbolt, while you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been driving it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have felt a horse bolt while I was driving it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbut it\ndidn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t make me know it had two wills. I only knew it was frightened.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione had ceased to listen. She simply became oblivious when these\nsubjects were started.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should a horse want to put itself in the human power?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked\nUrsula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is quite incomprehensible to me. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe it ever\nwanted it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes it did.

Then the two women were silent. As soon as they were in\naccord, they began mutually to mistrust each other. In spite of\nherself, Ursula felt herself recoiling from Hermione. It was all she\ncould do to restrain her revulsion.\n\nThey returned to the men, like two conspirators who have withdrawn to\ncome to an agreement. Birkin looked up at them. Ursula hated him for\nhis cold watchfulness. But he said nothing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we be going?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRupert, you are coming to\nShortlands to dinner?

But she was in arms against them.\n\nShe ran home plunged in thought. She had been very much moved by\nHermione, she had really come into contact with her, so that there was\na sort of league between the two women. And yet she could not bear her.\nBut she put the thought away. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s really good,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe really wants what is right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And she tried to feel at one with\nHermione, and to shut off from Birkin. She was strictly hostile to him.\nBut she was held to him by some bond, some deep principle. This at once\nirritated her and saved her.\n\nOnly now and again, violent little shudders would come over her, out of\nher subconsciousness, and she knew it was the fact that she had stated\nher challenge to Birkin, and he had, consciously or unconsciously,\naccepted. It was a fight to the death between them\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or to new life:\nthough in what the conflict lay, no one could say.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XIII.\n\n\n MINO\n\nThe days went by, and she received no sign. Was he going to ignore her,\nwas he going to take no further notice of her secret? A dreary weight\nof anxiety and acrid bitterness settled on her. And yet Ursula knew she\nwas only deceiving herself, and that he _would_ proceed. She said no\nword to anybody.\n\nThen, sure enough, there came a note from him, asking if she would come\nto tea with Gudrun, to his rooms in town.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy does he ask Gudrun as well?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked herself at once. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoes he\nwant to protect himself, or does he think I would not go alone?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She\nwas tormented by the thought that he wanted to protect himself. But at\nthe end of all, she only said to herself:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want Gudrun to be there, because I want him to say something\nmore to me. So I shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t tell Gudrun anything about it, and I shall go\nalone. Then I shall know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe found herself sitting on the tram-car, mounting up the hill going\nout of the town, to the place where he had his lodging. She seemed to\nhave passed into a kind of dream world, absolved from the conditions of\nactuality. She watched the sordid streets of the town go by beneath\nher, as if she were a spirit disconnected from the material universe.\nWhat had it all to do with her? She was palpitating and formless within\nthe flux of the ghost life. She could not consider any more, what\nanybody would say of her or think about her. People had passed out of\nher range, she was absolved. She had fallen strange and dim, out of the\nsheath of the material life, as a berry falls from the only world it\nhas ever known, down out of the sheath on to the real unknown.\n\nBirkin was standing in the middle of the room, when she was shown in by\nthe landlady. He too was moved outside himself. She saw him agitated\nand shaken, a frail, unsubstantial body silent like the node of some\nviolent force, that came out from him and shook her almost into a\nswoon.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are alone?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Gudrun could not come.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe instantly guessed why.\n\nAnd they were both seated in silence, in the terrible tension of the\nroom. She was aware that it was a pleasant room, full of light and very\nrestful in its form\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094aware also of a fuchsia tree, with dangling scarlet\nand purple flowers.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow nice the fuchsias are!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, to break the silence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they!

She did\nnot answer. Her heart was too much contracted. She could not have\nspoken.\n\nSeeing she was not going to reply, he continued, almost bitterly,\ngiving himself away:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t say it is love I have to offer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love I want. It is\nsomething much more impersonal and harder\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and rarer.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a silence, out of which she said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou mean you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe suffered furiously, saying that.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, if you like to put it like that. Though perhaps that isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t true.\nI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. At any rate, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t feel the emotion of love for you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094no,\nand I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to. Because it gives out in the last issues.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLove gives out in the last issues?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, feeling numb to the\nlips.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it does. At the very last, one is alone, beyond the influence of\nlove. There is a real impersonal me, that is beyond love, beyond any\nemotional relationship. So it is with you. But we want to delude\nourselves that love is the root. It isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. It is only the branches. The\nroot is beyond love, a naked kind of isolation, an isolated me, that\ndoes _not_ meet and mingle, and never can.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe watched him with wide, troubled eyes. His face was incandescent in\nits abstract earnestness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you mean you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, in trepidation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, if you like. I have loved. But there is a beyond, where there is\nnot love.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe could not submit to this. She felt it swooning over her. But she\ncould not submit.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how do you know\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if you have never _really_ loved?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is true, what I say; there is a beyond, in you, in me, which is\nfurther than love, beyond the scope, as stars are beyond the scope of\nvision, some of them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen there is no love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUltimately, no, there is something else. But, ultimately, there _is_\nno love.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula was given over to this statement for some moments. Then she half\nrose from her chair, saying, in a final, repellent voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen let me go home\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what am I doing here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is the door,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are a free agent.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was suspended finely and perfectly in this extremity. She hung\nmotionless for some seconds, then she sat down again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf there is no love, what is there?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, almost jeering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSomething,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, looking at her, battling with his soul, with all\nhis might.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was silent for a long time, unable to be in communication with her\nwhile she was in this state of opposition.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a voice of pure abstraction; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ca final me which\nis stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility. So there is a final\nyou. And it is there I would want to meet you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not in the emotional,\nloving plane\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but there beyond, where there is no speech and no terms of\nagreement. There we are two stark, unknown beings, two utterly strange\ncreatures, I would want to approach you, and you me. And there could be\nno obligation, because there is no standard for action there, because\nno understanding has been reaped from that plane. It is quite\ninhuman,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so there can be no calling to book, in any form\nwhatsoever\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094because one is outside the pale of all that is accepted, and\nnothing known applies. One can only follow the impulse, taking that\nwhich lies in front, and responsible for nothing, asked for nothing,\ngiving nothing, only each taking according to the primal desire.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula listened to this speech, her mind dumb and almost senseless,\nwhat he said was so unexpected and so untoward.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is just purely selfish,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf it is pure, yes. But it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t selfish at all. Because I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\n_know_ what I want of you. I deliver _myself_ over to the unknown, in\ncoming to you, I am without reserves or defences, stripped entirely,\ninto the unknown. Only there needs the pledge between us, that we will\nboth cast off everything, cast off ourselves even, and cease to be, so\nthat that which is perfectly ourselves can take place in us.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe pondered along her own line of thought.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut it is because you love me, that you want me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she persisted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. It is because I believe in you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if I _do_ believe in you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you sure?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed, suddenly hurt.\n\nHe was looking at her steadfastly, scarcely heeding what she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I must believe in you, or else I shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be here saying this,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nhe replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut that is all the proof I have. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t feel any very\nstrong belief at this particular moment.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe disliked him for this sudden relapse into weariness and\nfaithlessness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think me good-looking?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she persisted, in a mocking\nvoice.\n\nHe looked at her, to see if he felt that she was good-looking.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _feel_ that you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re good-looking,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot even attractive?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she mocked, bitingly.\n\nHe knitted his brows in sudden exasperation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you see that it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not a question of visual appreciation in the\nleast,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _want_ to see you.

She interpreted it, that he had made a deep confession of\nlove to her. But he was so absurd in his words, also.\n\nThey were silent for many minutes, she was pleased and elated like a\nchild. His concentration broke, he began to look at her simply and\nnaturally.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat I want is a strange conjunction with you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said quietly; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cnot\nmeeting and mingling\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you are quite right\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but an equilibrium, a pure\nbalance of two single beings\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094as the stars balance each other.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him. He was very earnest, and earnestness was always\nrather ridiculous, commonplace, to her. It made her feel unfree and\nuncomfortable. Yet she liked him so much. But why drag in the stars.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t this rather sudden?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she mocked.\n\nHe began to laugh.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBest to read the terms of the contract, before we sign,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nA young grey cat that had been sleeping on the sofa jumped down and\nstretched, rising on its long legs, and arching its slim back. Then it\nsat considering for a moment, erect and kingly. And then, like a dart,\nit had shot out of the room, through the open window-doors, and into\nthe garden.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s he after?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, rising.\n\nThe young cat trotted lordly down the path, waving his tail. He was an\nordinary tabby with white paws, a slender young gentleman. A crouching,\nfluffy, brownish-grey cat was stealing up the side of the fence. The\nMino walked statelily up to her, with manly nonchalance. She crouched\nbefore him and pressed herself on the ground in humility, a fluffy soft\noutcast, looking up at him with wild eyes that were green and lovely as\ngreat jewels. He looked casually down on her. So she crept a few inches\nfurther, proceeding on her way to the back door, crouching in a\nwonderful, soft, self-obliterating manner, and moving like a shadow.\n\nHe, going statelily on his slim legs, walked after her, then suddenly,\nfor pure excess, he gave her a light cuff with his paw on the side of\nher face. She ran off a few steps, like a blown leaf along the ground,\nthen crouched unobtrusively, in submissive, wild patience. The Mino\npretended to take no notice of her. He blinked his eyes superbly at the\nlandscape. In a minute she drew herself together and moved softly, a\nfleecy brown-grey shadow, a few paces forward. She began to quicken her\npace, in a moment she would be gone like a dream, when the young grey\nlord sprang before her, and gave her a light handsome cuff. She\nsubsided at once, submissively.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe is a wild cat,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe has come in from the woods.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe eyes of the stray cat flared round for a moment, like great green\nfires staring at Birkin. Then she had rushed in a soft swift rush, half\nway down the garden. There she paused to look round. The Mino turned\nhis face in pure superiority to his master, and slowly closed his eyes,\nstanding in statuesque young perfection. The wild cat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s round, green,\nwondering eyes were staring all the while like uncanny fires.

This year the staff of\nthe Grammar-School was invited, along with the chief officials of the\nfirm. Gerald and the younger Criches did not care for this party, but\nit had become customary now, and it pleased the father, as being the\nonly occasion when he could gather some people of the district together\nin festivity with him. For he loved to give pleasures to his dependents\nand to those poorer than himself. But his children preferred the\ncompany of their own equals in wealth. They hated their inferiors\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\nhumility or gratitude or awkwardness.\n\nNevertheless they were willing to attend at this festival, as they had\ndone almost since they were children, the more so, as they all felt a\nlittle guilty now, and unwilling to thwart their father any more, since\nhe was so ill in health. Therefore, quite cheerfully Laura prepared to\ntake her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s place as hostess, and Gerald assumed responsibility\nfor the amusements on the water.\n\nBirkin had written to Ursula saying he expected to see her at the\nparty, and Gudrun, although she scorned the patronage of the Criches,\nwould nevertheless accompany her mother and father if the weather were\nfine.\n\nThe day came blue and full of sunshine, with little wafts of wind. The\nsisters both wore dresses of white cr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aape, and hats of soft grass. But\nGudrun had a sash of brilliant black and pink and yellow colour wound\nbroadly round her waist, and she had pink silk stockings, and black and\npink and yellow decoration on the brim of her hat, weighing it down a\nlittle. She carried also a yellow silk coat over her arm, so that she\nlooked remarkable, like a painting from the Salon. Her appearance was a\nsore trial to her father, who said angrily:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think you might as well get yourself up for a Christmas\ncracker, an\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 done with it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut Gudrun looked handsome and brilliant, and she wore her clothes in\npure defiance. When people stared at her, and giggled after her, she\nmade a point of saying loudly, to Ursula:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Regarde, regarde ces gens-l\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0! Ne sont-ils pas des hiboux\nincroyables?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And with the words of French in her mouth, she would\nlook over her shoulder at the giggling party.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, really, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s impossible!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula would reply distinctly. And so\nthe two girls took it out of their universal enemy. But their father\nbecame more and more enraged.\n\nUrsula was all snowy white, save that her hat was pink, and entirely\nwithout trimming, and her shoes were dark red, and she carried an\norange-coloured coat. And in this guise they were walking all the way\nto Shortlands, their father and mother going in front.\n\nThey were laughing at their mother, who, dressed in a summer material\nof black and purple stripes, and wearing a hat of purple straw, was\nsetting forth with much more of the shyness and trepidation of a young\ngirl than her daughters ever felt, walking demurely beside her husband,\nwho, as usual, looked rather crumpled in his best suit, as if he were\nthe father of a young family and had been holding the baby whilst his\nwife got dressed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook at the young couple in front,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun calmly. Ursula looked\nat her mother and father, and was suddenly seized with uncontrollable\nlaughter. The two girls stood in the road and laughed till the tears\nran down their faces, as they caught sight again of the shy, unworldly\ncouple of their parents going on ahead.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe are roaring at you, mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called Ursula, helplessly following\nafter her parents.\n\nMrs Brangwen turned round with a slightly puzzled, exasperated look.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh indeed!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is there so very funny about _me_, I\nshould like to know?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe could not understand that there could be anything amiss with her\nappearance. She had a perfect calm sufficiency, an easy indifference to\nany criticism whatsoever, as if she were beyond it. Her clothes were\nalways rather odd, and as a rule slip-shod, yet she wore them with a\nperfect ease and satisfaction. Whatever she had on, so long as she was\nbarely tidy, she was right, beyond remark; such an aristocrat she was\nby instinct.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou look so stately, like a country Baroness,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, laughing\nwith a little tenderness at her mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s naive puzzled air.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Just_ like a country Baroness!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d chimed in Gudrun. Now the mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nnatural hauteur became self-conscious, and the girls shrieked again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo home, you pair of idiots, great giggling idiots!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the father\ninflamed with irritation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMm-m-er!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d booed Ursula, pulling a face at his crossness.\n\nThe yellow lights danced in his eyes, he leaned forward in real rage.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be so silly as to take any notice of the great gabies,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mrs\nBrangwen, turning on her way.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll see if I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going to be followed by a pair of giggling yelling\njackanapes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried vengefully.\n\nThe girls stood still, laughing helplessly at his fury, upon the path\nbeside the hedge.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re as silly as they are, to take any notice,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mrs\nBrangwen also becoming angry now he was really enraged.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere are some people coming, father,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, with mocking\nwarning. He glanced round quickly, and went on to join his wife,\nwalking stiff with rage. And the girls followed, weak with laughter.\n\nWhen the people had passed by, Brangwen cried in a loud, stupid voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going back home if there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s any more of this. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m damned if I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m\ngoing to be made a fool of in this fashion, in the public road.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was really out of temper. At the sound of his blind, vindictive\nvoice, the laughter suddenly left the girls, and their hearts\ncontracted with contempt. They hated his words \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cin the public road.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nWhat did they care for the public road? But Gudrun was conciliatory.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t laughing to _hurt_ you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, with an uncouth\ngentleness which made her parents uncomfortable. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe were laughing\nbecause we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re fond of you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll walk on in front, if they are _so_ touchy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, angry.\nAnd in this wise they arrived at Willey Water. The lake was blue and\nfair, the meadows sloped down in sunshine on one side, the thick dark\nwoods dropped steeply on the other. The little pleasure-launch was\nfussing out from the shore, twanging its music, crowded with people,\nflapping its paddles. Near the boat-house was a throng of gaily-dressed\npersons, small in the distance. And on the high-road, some of the\ncommon people were standing along the hedge, looking at the festivity\nbeyond, enviously, like souls not admitted to paradise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy eye!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, _sotto voce_, looking at the motley of guests,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a pretty crowd if you like! Imagine yourself in the midst of\nthat, my dear.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s apprehensive horror of people in the mass unnerved Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\nlooks rather awful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said anxiously.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd imagine what they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be like\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094_imagine!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, still in\nthat unnerving, subdued voice. Yet she advanced determinedly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI suppose we can get away from them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula anxiously.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re in a pretty fix if we can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. Her extreme ironic\nloathing and apprehension was very trying to Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stay,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI certainly shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stay five minutes among that little lot,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nGudrun. They advanced nearer, till they saw policemen at the gates.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPolicemen to keep you in, too!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy word, this is a\nbeautiful affair.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better look after father and mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula anxiously.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s _perfectly_ capable of getting through this little\ncelebration,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun with some contempt.\n\nBut Ursula knew that her father felt uncouth and angry and unhappy, so\nshe was far from her ease. They waited outside the gate till their\nparents came up. The tall, thin man in his crumpled clothes was\nunnerved and irritable as a boy, finding himself on the brink of this\nsocial function. He did not feel a gentleman, he did not feel anything\nexcept pure exasperation.\n\nUrsula took her place at his side, they gave their tickets to the\npoliceman, and passed in on to the grass, four abreast; the tall, hot,\nruddy-dark man with his narrow boyish brow drawn with irritation, the\nfresh-faced, easy woman, perfectly collected though her hair was\nslipping on one side, then Gudrun, her eyes round and dark and staring,\nher full soft face impassive, almost sulky, so that she seemed to be\nbacking away in antagonism even whilst she was advancing; and then\nUrsula, with the odd, brilliant, dazzled look on her face, that always\ncame when she was in some false situation.\n\nBirkin was the good angel. He came smiling to them with his affected\nsocial grace, that somehow was never _quite_ right. But he took off his\nhat and smiled at them with a real smile in his eyes, so that Brangwen\ncried out heartily in relief:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do? You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re better, are you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m better. How do you do, Mrs Brangwen? I know Gudrun and Ursula\nvery well.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHis eyes smiled full of natural warmth. He had a soft, flattering\nmanner with women, particularly with women who were not young.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mrs Brangwen, cool but yet gratified. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have heard them\nspeak of you often enough.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe laughed. Gudrun looked aside, feeling she was being belittled.\nPeople were standing about in groups, some women were sitting in the\nshade of the walnut tree, with cups of tea in their hands, a waiter in\nevening dress was hurrying round, some girls were simpering with\nparasols, some young men, who had just come in from rowing, were\nsitting cross-legged on the grass, coatless, their shirt-sleeves rolled\nup in manly fashion, their hands resting on their white flannel\ntrousers, their gaudy ties floating about, as they laughed and tried to\nbe witty with the young damsels.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d thought Gudrun churlishly, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they have the manners to put\ntheir coats on, and not to assume such intimacy in their appearance.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe abhorred the ordinary young man, with his hair plastered back, and\nhis easy-going chumminess.\n\nHermione Roddice came up, in a handsome gown of white lace, trailing an\nenormous silk shawl blotched with great embroidered flowers, and\nbalancing an enormous plain hat on her head. She looked striking,\nastonishing, almost macabre, so tall, with the fringe of her great\ncream-coloured vividly-blotched shawl trailing on the ground after her,\nher thick hair coming low over her eyes, her face strange and long and\npale, and the blotches of brilliant colour drawn round her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t she look _weird!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun heard some girls titter behind her.\nAnd she could have killed them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, coming up very kindly, and glancing\nslowly over Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s father and mother. It was a trying moment,\nexasperating for Gudrun. Hermione was really so strongly entrenched in\nher class superiority, she could come up and know people out of simple\ncuriosity, as if they were creatures on exhibition. Gudrun would do the\nsame herself. But she resented being in the position when somebody\nmight do it to her.\n\nHermione, very remarkable, and distinguishing the Brangwens very much,\nled them along to where Laura Crich stood receiving the guests.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis is Mrs Brangwen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, and Laura, who wore a stiff\nembroidered linen dress, shook hands and said she was glad to see her.\nThen Gerald came up, dressed in white, with a black and brown blazer,\nand looking handsome. He too was introduced to the Brangwen parents,\nand immediately he spoke to Mrs Brangwen as if she were a lady, and to\nBrangwen as if he were _not_ a gentleman. Gerald was so obvious in his\ndemeanour. He had to shake hands with his left hand, because he had\nhurt his right, and carried it, bandaged up, in the pocket of his\njacket. Gudrun was _very_ thankful that none of her party asked him\nwhat was the matter with the hand.\n\nThe steam launch was fussing in, all its music jingling, people calling\nexcitedly from on board. Gerald went to see to the debarkation, Birkin\nwas getting tea for Mrs Brangwen, Brangwen had joined a Grammar-School\ngroup, Hermione was sitting down by their mother, the girls went to the\nlanding-stage to watch the launch come in.\n\nShe hooted and tooted gaily, then her paddles were silent, the ropes\nwere thrown ashore, she drifted in with a little bump. Immediately the\npassengers crowded excitedly to come ashore.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWait a minute, wait a minute,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d shouted Gerald in sharp command.\n\nThey must wait till the boat was tight on the ropes, till the small\ngangway was put out.

But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve had a canoe at Arundel, and I\nassure you I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m perfectly safe.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSo saying, having given her word like a man, she and Ursula entered the\nfrail craft, and pushed gently off. The two men stood watching them.\nGudrun was paddling. She knew the men were watching her, and it made\nher slow and rather clumsy. The colour flew in her face like a flag.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThanks awfully,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she called back to him, from the water, as the boat\nslid away. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s lovely\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094like sitting in a leaf.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe laughed at the fancy. Her voice was shrill and strange, calling from\nthe distance. He watched her as she paddled away. There was something\nchildlike about her, trustful and deferential, like a child. He watched\nher all the while, as she rowed. And to Gudrun it was a real delight,\nin make-belief, to be the childlike, clinging woman to the man who\nstood there on the quay, so good-looking and efficient in his white\nclothes, and moreover the most important man she knew at the moment.\nShe did not take any notice of the wavering, indistinct, lambent\nBirkin, who stood at his side. One figure at a time occupied the field\nof her attention.\n\nThe boat rustled lightly along the water. They passed the bathers whose\nstriped tents stood between the willows of the meadow\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s edge, and drew\nalong the open shore, past the meadows that sloped golden in the light\nof the already late afternoon. Other boats were stealing under the\nwooded shore opposite, they could hear people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s laughter and voices.\nBut Gudrun rowed on towards the clump of trees that balanced perfect in\nthe distance, in the golden light.\n\nThe sisters found a little place where a tiny stream flowed into the\nlake, with reeds and flowery marsh of pink willow herb, and a gravelly\nbank to the side. Here they ran delicately ashore, with their frail\nboat, the two girls took off their shoes and stockings and went through\nthe water\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s edge to the grass. The tiny ripples of the lake were warm\nand clear, they lifted their boat on to the bank, and looked round with\njoy. They were quite alone in a forsaken little stream-mouth, and on\nthe knoll just behind was the clump of trees.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will bathe just for a moment,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand then we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have\ntea.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey looked round. Nobody could notice them, or could come up in time\nto see them. In less than a minute Ursula had thrown off her clothes\nand had slipped naked into the water, and was swimming out. Quickly,\nGudrun joined her. They swam silently and blissfully for a few minutes,\ncircling round their little stream-mouth. Then they slipped ashore and\nran into the grove again, like nymphs.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow lovely it is to be free,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, running swiftly here and\nthere between the tree trunks, quite naked, her hair blowing loose. The\ngrove was of beech-trees, big and splendid, a steel-grey scaffolding of\ntrunks and boughs, with level sprays of strong green here and there,\nwhilst through the northern side the distance glimmered open as through\na window.\n\nWhen they had run and danced themselves dry, the girls quickly dressed\nand sat down to the fragrant tea. They sat on the northern side of the\ngrove, in the yellow sunshine facing the slope of the grassy hill,\nalone in a little wild world of their own. The tea was hot and\naromatic, there were delicious little sandwiches of cucumber and of\ncaviare, and winy cakes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you happy, Prune?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in delight, looking at her sister.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m perfectly happy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gudrun gravely, looking at the\nwestering sun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo am I.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWhen they were together, doing the things they enjoyed, the two sisters\nwere quite complete in a perfect world of their own. And this was one\nof the perfect moments of freedom and delight, such as children alone\nknow, when all seems a perfect and blissful adventure.\n\nWhen they had finished tea, the two girls sat on, silent and serene.\nThen Ursula, who had a beautiful strong voice, began to sing to\nherself, softly: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0084nnchen von Tharau.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun listened, as she sat\nbeneath the trees, and the yearning came into her heart. Ursula seemed\nso peaceful and sufficient unto herself, sitting there unconsciously\ncrooning her song, strong and unquestioned at the centre of her own\nuniverse. And Gudrun felt herself outside. Always this desolating,\nagonised feeling, that she was outside of life, an onlooker, whilst\nUrsula was a partaker, caused Gudrun to suffer from a sense of her own\nnegation, and made her, that she must always demand the other to be\naware of her, to be in connection with her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you mind if I do Dalcroze to that tune, Hurtler?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked in a\ncurious muted tone, scarce moving her lips.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat did you say?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula, looking up in peaceful surprise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you sing while I do Dalcroze?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, suffering at having\nto repeat herself.\n\nUrsula thought a moment, gathering her straying wits together.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhile you do\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked vaguely.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDalcroze movements,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, suffering tortures of\nself-consciousness, even because of her sister.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh Dalcroze! I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t catch the name. _Do_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I should love to see\nyou,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, with childish surprised brightness. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat shall I\nsing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSing anything you like, and I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll take the rhythm from it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut Ursula could not for her life think of anything to sing. However,\nshe suddenly began, in a laughing, teasing voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094is a high-born lady\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun, looking as if some invisible chain weighed on her hands and\nfeet, began slowly to dance in the eurythmic manner, pulsing and\nfluttering rhythmically with her feet, making slower, regular gestures\nwith her hands and arms, now spreading her arms wide, now raising them\nabove her head, now flinging them softly apart, and lifting her face,\nher feet all the time beating and running to the measure of the song,\nas if it were some strange incantation, her white, rapt form drifting\nhere and there in a strange impulsive rhapsody, seeming to be lifted on\na breeze of incantation, shuddering with strange little runs. Ursula\nsat on the grass, her mouth open in her singing, her eyes laughing as\nif she thought it was a great joke, but a yellow light flashing up in\nthem, as she caught some of the unconscious ritualistic suggestion of\nthe complex shuddering and waving and drifting of her sister\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s white\nform, that was clutched in pure, mindless, tossing rhythm, and a will\nset powerful in a kind of hypnotic influence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love is a high-born lady\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094She is-s-s\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094rather dark than shady\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rang\nout Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s laughing, satiric song, and quicker, fiercer went Gudrun\nin the dance, stamping as if she were trying to throw off some bond,\nflinging her hands suddenly and stamping again, then rushing with face\nuplifted and throat full and beautiful, and eyes half closed,\nsightless. The sun was low and yellow, sinking down, and in the sky\nfloated a thin, ineffectual moon.\n\nUrsula was quite absorbed in her song, when suddenly Gudrun stopped and\nsaid mildly, ironically:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, opening her eyes out of the trance.\n\nGudrun was standing still and pointing, a mocking smile on her face,\ntowards the side.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUgh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in sudden panic, starting to her feet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re quite all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d rang out Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sardonic voice.\n\nOn the left stood a little cluster of Highland cattle, vividly coloured\nand fleecy in the evening light, their horns branching into the sky,\npushing forward their muzzles inquisitively, to know what it was all\nabout. Their eyes glittered through their tangle of hair, their naked\nnostrils were full of shadow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they do anything?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in fear.\n\nGudrun, who was usually frightened of cattle, now shook her head in a\nqueer, half-doubtful, half-sardonic motion, a faint smile round her\nmouth.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they look charming, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, in a high, strident\nvoice, something like the scream of a seagull.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCharming,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in trepidation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they do anything to\nus?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain Gudrun looked back at her sister with an enigmatic smile, and\nshook her head.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure they won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, as if she had to convince herself\nalso, and yet, as if she were confident of some secret power in\nherself, and had to put it to the test. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSit down and sing again,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she\ncalled in her high, strident voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m frightened,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, in a pathetic voice, watching the group\nof sturdy short cattle, that stood with their knees planted, and\nwatched with their dark, wicked eyes, through the matted fringe of\ntheir hair. Nevertheless, she sank down again, in her former posture.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey are quite safe,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s high call. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSing something, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve\nonly to sing something.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was evident she had a strange passion to dance before the sturdy,\nhandsome cattle.\n\nUrsula began to sing, in a false quavering voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWay down in Tennessee\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe sounded purely anxious. Nevertheless, Gudrun, with her arms\noutspread and her face uplifted, went in a strange palpitating dance\ntowards the cattle, lifting her body towards them as if in a spell, her\nfeet pulsing as if in some little frenzy of unconscious sensation, her\narms, her wrists, her hands stretching and heaving and falling and\nreaching and reaching and falling, her breasts lifted and shaken\ntowards the cattle, her throat exposed as in some voluptuous ecstasy\ntowards them, whilst she drifted imperceptibly nearer, an uncanny white\nfigure, towards them, carried away in its own rapt trance, ebbing in\nstrange fluctuations upon the cattle, that waited, and ducked their\nheads a little in sudden contraction from her, watching all the time as\nif hypnotised, their bare horns branching in the clear light, as the\nwhite figure of the woman ebbed upon them, in the slow, hypnotising\nconvulsion of the dance. She could feel them just in front of her, it\nwas as if she had the electric pulse from their breasts running into\nher hands. Soon she would touch them, actually touch them. A terrible\nshiver of fear and pleasure went through her. And all the while,\nUrsula, spell-bound, kept up her high-pitched thin, irrelevant song,\nwhich pierced the fading evening like an incantation.\n\nGudrun could hear the cattle breathing heavily with helpless fear and\nfascination. Oh, they were brave little beasts, these wild Scotch\nbullocks, wild and fleecy. Suddenly one of them snorted, ducked its\nhead, and backed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHue! Hi-eee!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came a sudden loud shout from the edge of the grove. The\ncattle broke and fell back quite spontaneously, went running up the\nhill, their fleece waving like fire to their motion. Gudrun stood\nsuspended out on the grass, Ursula rose to her feet.\n\nIt was Gerald and Birkin come to find them, and Gerald had cried out to\nfrighten off the cattle.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you think you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he now called, in a high, wondering\nvexed tone.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy have you come?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came back Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s strident cry of anger.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you think you were doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald repeated, automatically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe were doing eurythmics,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Ursula, in a shaken voice.\n\nGudrun stood aloof looking at them with large dark eyes of resentment,\nsuspended for a few moments. Then she walked away up the hill, after\nthe cattle, which had gathered in a little, spell-bound cluster higher\nup.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are you going?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald called after her. And he followed her up\nthe hill-side. The sun had gone behind the hill, and shadows were\nclinging to the earth, the sky above was full of travelling light.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA poor song for a dance,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin to Ursula, standing before her\nwith a sardonic, flickering laugh on his face. And in another second,\nhe was singing softly to himself, and dancing a grotesque step-dance in\nfront of her, his limbs and body shaking loose, his face flickering\npalely, a constant thing, whilst his feet beat a rapid mocking tattoo,\nand his body seemed to hang all loose and quaking in between, like a\nshadow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve all gone mad,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, laughing rather frightened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPity we aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t madder,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, as he kept up the incessant\nshaking dance. Then suddenly he leaned up to her and kissed her fingers\nlightly, putting his face to hers and looking into her eyes with a pale\ngrin. She stepped back, affronted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOffended\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked ironically, suddenly going quite still and\nreserved again. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI thought you liked the light fantastic.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot like that,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, confused and bewildered, almost affronted.\nYet somewhere inside her she was fascinated by the sight of his loose,\nvibrating body, perfectly abandoned to its own dropping and swinging,\nand by the pallid, sardonic-smiling face above. Yet automatically she\nstiffened herself away, and disapproved. It seemed almost an obscenity,\nin a man who talked as a rule so very seriously.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy not like that?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he mocked. And immediately he dropped again into\nthe incredibly rapid, slack-waggling dance, watching her malevolently.\nAnd moving in the rapid, stationary dance, he came a little nearer, and\nreached forward with an incredibly mocking, satiric gleam on his face,\nand would have kissed her again, had she not started back.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, really afraid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCordelia after all,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said satirically. She was stung, as if this\nwere an insult. She knew he intended it as such, and it bewildered her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried in retort, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhy do you always take your soul in\nyour mouth, so frightfully full?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo that I can spit it out the more readily,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, pleased by his\nown retort.\n\nGerald Crich, his face narrowing to an intent gleam, followed up the\nhill with quick strides, straight after Gudrun. The cattle stood with\ntheir noses together on the brow of a slope, watching the scene below,\nthe men in white hovering about the white forms of the women, watching\nabove all Gudrun, who was advancing slowly towards them. She stood a\nmoment, glancing back at Gerald, and then at the cattle.\n\nThen in a sudden motion, she lifted her arms and rushed sheer upon the\nlong-horned bullocks, in shuddering irregular runs, pausing for a\nsecond and looking at them, then lifting her hands and running forward\nwith a flash, till they ceased pawing the ground, and gave way,\nsnorting with terror, lifting their heads from the ground and flinging\nthemselves away, galloping off into the evening, becoming tiny in the\ndistance, and still not stopping.\n\nGudrun remained staring after them, with a mask-like defiant face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do you want to drive them mad?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gerald, coming up with her.\n\nShe took no notice of him, only averted her face from him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not\nsafe, you know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he persisted. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re nasty, when they do turn.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTurn where? Turn away?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she mocked loudly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cturn against you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTurn against _me?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she mocked.\n\nHe could make nothing of this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnyway, they gored one of the farmer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cows to death, the other day,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nhe said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do I care?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_I_ cared though,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cseeing that they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re my cattle.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow are they yours! You haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t swallowed them. Give me one of them\nnow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, holding out her hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou know where they are,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, pointing over the hill. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\nhave one if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d like it sent to you later on.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him inscrutably.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m afraid of you and your cattle, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nHis eyes narrowed dangerously. There was a faint domineering smile on\nhis face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should I think that?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe was watching him all the time with her dark, dilated, inchoate\neyes. She leaned forward and swung round her arm, catching him a light\nblow on the face with the back of her hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s why,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, mocking.\n\nAnd she felt in her soul an unconquerable desire for deep violence\nagainst him. She shut off the fear and dismay that filled her conscious\nmind. She wanted to do as she did, she was not going to be afraid.\n\nHe recoiled from the slight blow on his face. He became deadly pale,\nand a dangerous flame darkened his eyes. For some seconds he could not\nspeak, his lungs were so suffused with blood, his heart stretched\nalmost to bursting with a great gush of ungovernable emotion. It was as\nif some reservoir of black emotion had burst within him, and swamped\nhim.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou have struck the first blow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said at last, forcing the words\nfrom his lungs, in a voice so soft and low, it sounded like a dream\nwithin her, not spoken in the outer air.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd I shall strike the last,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she retorted involuntarily, with\nconfident assurance. He was silent, he did not contradict her.\n\nShe stood negligently, staring away from him, into the distance. On the\nedge of her consciousness the question was asking itself,\nautomatically:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy _are_ you behaving in this _impossible_ and ridiculous fashion.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nBut she was sullen, she half shoved the question out of herself. She\ncould not get it clean away, so she felt self-conscious.\n\nGerald, very pale, was watching her closely. His eyes were lit up with\nintent lights, absorbed and gleaming. She turned suddenly on him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s you who make me behave like this, you know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, almost\nsuggestive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI? How?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nBut she turned away, and set off towards the lake. Below, on the water,\nlanterns were coming alight, faint ghosts of warm flame floating in the\npallor of the first twilight. The earth was spread with darkness, like\nlacquer, overhead was a pale sky, all primrose, and the lake was pale\nas milk in one part. Away at the landing stage, tiniest points of\ncoloured rays were stringing themselves in the dusk. The launch was\nbeing illuminated. All round, shadow was gathering from the trees.\n\nGerald, white like a presence in his summer clothes, was following down\nthe open grassy slope. Gudrun waited for him to come up. Then she\nsoftly put out her hand and touched him, saying softly:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be angry with me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA flame flew over him, and he was unconscious. Yet he stammered:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not angry with you. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m in love with you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHis mind was gone, he grasped for sufficient mechanical control, to\nsave himself. She laughed a silvery little mockery, yet intolerably\ncaressive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s one way of putting it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nThe terrible swooning burden on his mind, the awful swooning, the loss\nof all his control, was too much for him. He grasped her arm in his one\nhand, as if his hand were iron.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right, then, is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, holding her arrested.\n\nShe looked at the face with the fixed eyes, set before her, and her\nblood ran cold.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said softly, as if drugged, her voice\ncrooning and witch-like.\n\nHe walked on beside her, a striding, mindless body. But he recovered a\nlittle as he went. He suffered badly. He had killed his brother when a\nboy, and was set apart, like Cain.\n\nThey found Birkin and Ursula sitting together by the boats, talking and\nlaughing. Birkin had been teasing Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you smell this little marsh?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, sniffing the air. He was\nvery sensitive to scents, and quick in understanding them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s rather nice,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009calarming.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy alarming?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt seethes and seethes, a river of darkness,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cputting forth\nlilies and snakes, and the _ignis fatuus_, and rolling all the time\nonward.

We always consider the silver river\nof life, rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness, on\nand on to heaven, flowing into a bright eternal sea, a heaven of angels\nthronging.

Gerald and Gudrun came up. They all began to smoke, in the\nmoments of silence. One after another, Birkin lighted their cigarettes.\nThe match flickered in the twilight, and they were all smoking\npeacefully by the water-side. The lake was dim, the light dying from\noff it, in the midst of the dark land. The air all round was\nintangible, neither here nor there, and there was an unreal noise of\nbanjoes, or suchlike music.\n\nAs the golden swim of light overhead died out, the moon gained\nbrightness, and seemed to begin to smile forth her ascendancy. The dark\nwoods on the opposite shore melted into universal shadow. And amid this\nuniversal under-shadow, there was a scattered intrusion of lights. Far\ndown the lake were fantastic pale strings of colour, like beads of wan\nfire, green and red and yellow. The music came out in a little puff, as\nthe launch, all illuminated, veered into the great shadow, stirring her\noutlines of half-living lights, puffing out her music in little drifts.\n\nAll were lighting up. Here and there, close against the faint water,\nand at the far end of the lake, where the water lay milky in the last\nwhiteness of the sky, and there was no shadow, solitary, frail flames\nof lanterns floated from the unseen boats. There was a sound of oars,\nand a boat passed from the pallor into the darkness under the wood,\nwhere her lanterns seemed to kindle into fire, hanging in ruddy lovely\nglobes. And again, in the lake, shadowy red gleams hovered in\nreflection about the boat. Everywhere were these noiseless ruddy\ncreatures of fire drifting near the surface of the water, caught at by\nthe rarest, scarce visible reflections.\n\nBirkin brought the lanterns from the bigger boat, and the four shadowy\nwhite figures gathered round, to light them. Ursula held up the first,\nBirkin lowered the light from the rosy, glowing cup of his hands, into\nthe depths of the lantern. It was kindled, and they all stood back to\nlook at the great blue moon of light that hung from Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hand,\ncasting a strange gleam on her face. It flickered, and Birkin went\nbending over the well of light. His face shone out like an apparition,\nso unconscious, and again, something demoniacal. Ursula was dim and\nveiled, looming over him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is all right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said his voice softly.\n\nShe held up the lantern. It had a flight of storks streaming through a\nturquoise sky of light, over a dark earth.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis is beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLovely,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d echoed Gudrun, who wanted to hold one also, and lift it up\nfull of beauty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLight one for me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. Gerald stood by her, incapacitated.\nBirkin lit the lantern she held up. Her heart beat with anxiety, to see\nhow beautiful it would be. It was primrose yellow, with tall straight\nflowers growing darkly from their dark leaves, lifting their heads into\nthe primrose day, while butterflies hovered about them, in the pure\nclear light.\n\nGudrun gave a little cry of excitement, as if pierced with delight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it beautiful, oh, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it beautiful!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer soul was really pierced with beauty, she was translated beyond\nherself. Gerald leaned near to her, into her zone of light, as if to\nsee. He came close to her, and stood touching her, looking with her at\nthe primrose-shining globe. And she turned her face to his, that was\nfaintly bright in the light of the lantern, and they stood together in\none luminous union, close together and ringed round with light, all the\nrest excluded.\n\nBirkin looked away, and went to light Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s second lantern. It had a\npale ruddy sea-bottom, with black crabs and sea-weed moving sinuously\nunder a transparent sea, that passed into flamy ruddiness above.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got the heavens above, and the waters under the earth,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nBirkin to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnything but the earth itself,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed, watching his live hands\nthat hovered to attend to the light.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m dying to see what my second one is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, in a vibrating\nrather strident voice, that seemed to repel the others from her.\n\nBirkin went and kindled it. It was of a lovely deep blue colour, with a\nred floor, and a great white cuttle-fish flowing in white soft streams\nall over it. The cuttle-fish had a face that stared straight from the\nheart of the light, very fixed and coldly intent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow truly terrifying!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Gudrun, in a voice of horror.

I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see why you should pull me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy not?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can pull you as well as I could pull Ursula.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBy her tone he could tell she wanted to have him in the boat to\nherself, and that she was subtly gratified that she should have power\nover them both. He gave himself, in a strange, electric submission.\n\nShe handed him the lanterns, whilst she went to fix the cane at the end\nof the canoe. He followed after her, and stood with the lanterns\ndangling against his white-flannelled thighs, emphasising the shadow\naround.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cKiss me before we go,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came his voice softly from out of the shadow\nabove.\n\nShe stopped her work in real, momentary astonishment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she exclaimed, in pure surprise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he echoed, ironically.\n\nAnd she looked at him fixedly for some moments. Then she leaned forward\nand kissed him, with a slow, luxurious kiss, lingering on the mouth.\nAnd then she took the lanterns from him, while he stood swooning with\nthe perfect fire that burned in all his joints.\n\nThey lifted the canoe into the water, Gudrun took her place, and Gerald\npushed off.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you sure you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurt your hand, doing that?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked,\nsolicitous. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause I could have done it _perfectly_.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurt myself,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said in a low, soft voice, that caressed her\nwith inexpressible beauty.\n\nAnd she watched him as he sat near her, very near to her, in the stern\nof the canoe, his legs coming towards hers, his feet touching hers. And\nshe paddled softly, lingeringly, longing for him to say something\nmeaningful to her. But he remained silent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou like this, do you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in a gentle, solicitous voice.\n\nHe laughed shortly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is a space between us,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in the same low, unconscious\nvoice, as if something were speaking out of him. And she was as if\nmagically aware of their being balanced in separation, in the boat. She\nswooned with acute comprehension and pleasure.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m very near,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said caressively, gaily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYet distant, distant,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nAgain she was silent with pleasure, before she answered, speaking with\na reedy, thrilled voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYet we cannot very well change, whilst we are on the water.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She\ncaressed him subtly and strangely, having him completely at her mercy.\n\nA dozen or more boats on the lake swung their rosy and moon-like\nlanterns low on the water, that reflected as from a fire. In the\ndistance, the steamer twanged and thrummed and washed with her\nfaintly-splashing paddles, trailing her strings of coloured lights, and\noccasionally lighting up the whole scene luridly with an effusion of\nfireworks, Roman candles and sheafs of stars and other simple effects,\nilluminating the surface of the water, and showing the boats creeping\nround, low down. Then the lovely darkness fell again, the lanterns and\nthe little threaded lights glimmered softly, there was a muffled\nknocking of oars and a waving of music.\n\nGudrun paddled almost imperceptibly. Gerald could see, not far ahead,\nthe rich blue and the rose globes of Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s lanterns swaying softly\ncheek to cheek as Birkin rowed, and iridescent, evanescent gleams\nchasing in the wake. He was aware, too, of his own delicately coloured\nlights casting their softness behind him.\n\nGudrun rested her paddle and looked round. The canoe lifted with the\nlightest ebbing of the water. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s white knees were very near to\nher.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it beautiful!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said softly, as if reverently.\n\nShe looked at him, as he leaned back against the faint crystal of the\nlantern-light. She could see his face, although it was a pure shadow.\nBut it was a piece of twilight. And her breast was keen with passion\nfor him, he was so beautiful in his male stillness and mystery. It was\na certain pure effluence of maleness, like an aroma from his softly,\nfirmly moulded contours, a certain rich perfection of his presence,\nthat touched her with an ecstasy, a thrill of pure intoxication. She\nloved to look at him. For the present she did not want to touch him, to\nknow the further, satisfying substance of his living body. He was\npurely intangible, yet so near. Her hands lay on the paddle like\nslumber, she only wanted to see him, like a crystal shadow, to feel his\nessential presence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said vaguely. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is very beautiful.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was listening to the faint near sounds, the dropping of water-drops\nfrom the oar-blades, the slight drumming of the lanterns behind him, as\nthey rubbed against one another, the occasional rustling of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nfull skirt, an alien land noise. His mind was almost submerged, he was\nalmost transfused, lapsed out for the first time in his life, into the\nthings about him. For he always kept such a keen attentiveness,\nconcentrated and unyielding in himself. Now he had let go,\nimperceptibly he was melting into oneness with the whole. It was like\npure, perfect sleep, his first great sleep of life. He had been so\ninsistent, so guarded, all his life. But here was sleep, and peace, and\nperfect lapsing out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall I row to the landing-stage?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun wistfully.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnywhere,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet it drift.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTell me then, if we are running into anything,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, in that\nvery quiet, toneless voice of sheer intimacy.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe lights will show,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nSo they drifted almost motionless, in silence. He wanted silence, pure\nand whole. But she was uneasy yet for some word, for some assurance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNobody will miss you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, anxious for some communication.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMiss me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he echoed. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo! Why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wondered if anybody would be looking for you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should they look for me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And then he remembered his manners. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut\nperhaps you want to get back,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a changed voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to get back,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I assure you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re quite sure it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all right for you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerfectly all right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd again they were still. The launch twanged and hooted, somebody was\nsinging. Then as if the night smashed, suddenly there was a great\nshout, a confusion of shouting, warring on the water, then the horrid\nnoise of paddles reversed and churned violently.\n\nGerald sat up, and Gudrun looked at him in fear.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSomebody in the water,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, angrily, and desperately, looking\nkeenly across the dusk. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan you row up?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere, to the launch?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun, in nervous panic.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll tell me if I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t steer straight,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in nervous\napprehension.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou keep pretty level,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, and the canoe hastened forward.\n\nThe shouting and the noise continued, sounding horrid through the dusk,\nover the surface of the water.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t this _bound_ to happen?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, with heavy hateful irony.\nBut he hardly heard, and she glanced over her shoulder to see her way.\nThe half-dark waters were sprinkled with lovely bubbles of swaying\nlights, the launch did not look far off. She was rocking her lights in\nthe early night. Gudrun rowed as hard as she could. But now that it was\na serious matter, she seemed uncertain and clumsy in her stroke, it was\ndifficult to paddle swiftly. She glanced at his face. He was looking\nfixedly into the darkness, very keen and alert and single in himself,\ninstrumental. Her heart sank, she seemed to die a death. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe said to herself, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cnobody will be drowned. Of course they won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. It\nwould be too extravagant and sensational.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d But her heart was cold,\nbecause of his sharp impersonal face. It was as if he belonged\nnaturally to dread and catastrophe, as if he were himself again.\n\nThen there came a child\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice, a girl\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s high, piercing shriek:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDi\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh Di!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe blood ran cold in Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s veins.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Diana, is it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d muttered Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe young monkey, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d have to\nbe up to some of her tricks.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd he glanced again at the paddle, the boat was not going quickly\nenough for him. It made Gudrun almost helpless at the rowing, this\nnervous stress. She kept up with all her might. Still the voices were\ncalling and answering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere, where? There you are\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s it. Which? No\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094No-o-o. Damn it all,\nhere, _here_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Boats were hurrying from all directions to the scene,\ncoloured lanterns could be seen waving close to the surface of the\nlake, reflections swaying after them in uneven haste. The steamer\nhooted again, for some unknown reason. Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s boat was travelling\nquickly, the lanterns were swinging behind Gerald.\n\nAnd then again came the child\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s high, screaming voice, with a note of\nweeping and impatience in it now:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDi\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Oh Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Di\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was a terrible sound, coming through the obscure air of the evening.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d be better if you were in bed, Winnie,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald muttered to\nhimself.\n\nHe was stooping unlacing his shoes, pushing them off with the foot.\nThen he threw his soft hat into the bottom of the boat.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go into the water with your hurt hand,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun,\npanting, in a low voice of horror.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat? It won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurt.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe had struggled out of his jacket, and had dropped it between his\nfeet. He sat bare-headed, all in white now. He felt the belt at his\nwaist. They were nearing the launch, which stood still big above them,\nher myriad lamps making lovely darts, and sinuous running tongues of\nugly red and green and yellow light on the lustrous dark water, under\nthe shadow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh get her out!

He took no heed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLean back that way,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald to Gudrun, as he stood up in the\nfrail boat. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t upset.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIn another moment, he had dropped clean down, soft and plumb, into the\nwater. Gudrun was swaying violently in her boat, the agitated water\nshook with transient lights, she realised that it was faintly\nmoonlight, and that he was gone. So it was possible to be gone. A\nterrible sense of fatality robbed her of all feeling and thought. She\nknew he was gone out of the world, there was merely the same world, and\nabsence, his absence. The night seemed large and vacuous. Lanterns\nswayed here and there, people were talking in an undertone on the\nlaunch and in the boats. She could hear Winifred moaning: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Oh do find\nher Gerald, do find her_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d and someone trying to comfort the child.\nGudrun paddled aimlessly here and there. The terrible, massive, cold,\nboundless surface of the water terrified her beyond words. Would he\nnever come back? She felt she must jump into the water too, to know the\nhorror also.\n\nShe started, hearing someone say: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere he is.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She saw the movement\nof his swimming, like a water-rat. And she rowed involuntarily to him.\nBut he was near another boat, a bigger one. Still she rowed towards\nhim. She must be very near. She saw him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he looked like a seal. He\nlooked like a seal as he took hold of the side of the boat. His fair\nhair was washed down on his round head, his face seemed to glisten\nsuavely. She could hear him panting.\n\nThen he clambered into the boat. Oh, and the beauty of the subjection\nof his loins, white and dimly luminous as he climbed over the side of\nthe boat, made her want to die, to die. The beauty of his dim and\nluminous loins as he climbed into the boat, his back rounded and\nsoft\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ah, this was too much for her, too final a vision. She knew it,\nand it was fatal. The terrible hopelessness of fate, and of beauty,\nsuch beauty!\n\nHe was not like a man to her, he was an incarnation, a great phase of\nlife. She saw him press the water out of his face, and look at the\nbandage on his hand. And she knew it was all no good, and that she\nwould never go beyond him, he was the final approximation of life to\nher.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPut the lights out, we shall see better,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came his voice, sudden and\nmechanical and belonging to the world of man. She could scarcely\nbelieve there was a world of man. She leaned round and blew out her\nlanterns. They were difficult to blow out. Everywhere the lights were\ngone save the coloured points on the sides of the launch. The\nbluey-grey, early night spread level around, the moon was overhead,\nthere were shadows of boats here and there.\n\nAgain there was a splash, and he was gone under. Gudrun sat, sick at\nheart, frightened of the great, level surface of the water, so heavy\nand deadly. She was so alone, with the level, unliving field of the\nwater stretching beneath her. It was not a good isolation, it was a\nterrible, cold separation of suspense. She was suspended upon the\nsurface of the insidious reality until such time as she also should\ndisappear beneath it.\n\nThen she knew, by a stirring of voices, that he had climbed out again,\ninto a boat. She sat wanting connection with him. Strenuously she\nclaimed her connection with him, across the invisible space of the\nwater. But round her heart was an isolation unbearable, through which\nnothing would penetrate.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTake the launch in. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no use keeping her there. Get lines for the\ndragging,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the decisive, instrumental voice, that was full of the\nsound of the world.\n\nThe launch began gradually to beat the waters.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald! Gerald!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the wild crying voice of Winifred. He did not\nanswer. Slowly the launch drifted round in a pathetic, clumsy circle,\nand slunk away to the land, retreating into the dimness. The wash of\nher paddles grew duller. Gudrun rocked in her light boat, and dipped\nthe paddle automatically to steady herself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGudrun?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe boats of the two sisters pulled together.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere is Gerald?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dived again,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula plaintively. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd I know he ought not,\nwith his hurt hand and everything.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll take him in home this time,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nThe boats swayed again from the wash of steamer. Gudrun and Ursula kept\na look-out for Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere he is!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, who had the sharpest eyes. He had not been\nlong under. Birkin pulled towards him, Gudrun following. He swam\nslowly, and caught hold of the boat with his wounded hand. It slipped,\nand he sank back.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you help him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula sharply.\n\nHe came again, and Birkin leaned to help him in to the boat. Gudrun\nagain watched Gerald climb out of the water, but this time slowly,\nheavily, with the blind clambering motions of an amphibious beast,\nclumsy. Again the moon shone with faint luminosity on his white wet\nfigure, on the stooping back and the rounded loins. But it looked\ndefeated now, his body, it clambered and fell with slow clumsiness. He\nwas breathing hoarsely too, like an animal that is suffering. He sat\nslack and motionless in the boat, his head blunt and blind like a\nseal\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, his whole appearance inhuman, unknowing. Gudrun shuddered as\nshe mechanically followed his boat. Birkin rowed without speaking to\nthe landing-stage.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are you going?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked suddenly, as if just waking up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHome,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald imperiously. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go home while they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re in\nthe water. Turn back again, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going to find them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The women were\nfrightened, his voice was so imperative and dangerous, almost mad, not\nto be opposed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d There was a strange fluid compulsion in\nhis voice. Gerald was silent in a battle of wills. It was as if he\nwould kill the other man. But Birkin rowed evenly and unswerving, with\nan inhuman inevitability.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should you interfere?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, in hate.\n\nBirkin did not answer. He rowed towards the land. And Gerald sat mute,\nlike a dumb beast, panting, his teeth chattering, his arms inert, his\nhead like a seal\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s head.\n\nThey came to the landing-stage. Wet and naked-looking, Gerald climbed\nup the few steps. There stood his father, in the night.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes my boy?

I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve noticed it all my life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t put a thing\nright, once it has gone wrong.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey were walking across the high-road to the house.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd do you know, when you are down there, it is so cold, actually, and\nso endless, so different really from what it is on top, so endless\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you\nwonder how it is so many are alive, why we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re up here. Are you going? I\nshall see you again, shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t I? Good-night, and thank you. Thank you\nvery much!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe two girls waited a while, to see if there were any hope. The moon\nshone clearly overhead, with almost impertinent brightness, the small\ndark boats clustered on the water, there were voices and subdued\nshouts. But it was all to no purpose. Gudrun went home when Birkin\nreturned.\n\nHe was commissioned to open the sluice that let out the water from the\nlake, which was pierced at one end, near the high-road, thus serving as\na reservoir to supply with water the distant mines, in case of\nnecessity. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome with me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand then I will walk\nhome with you, when I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve done this.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe called at the water-keeper\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cottage and took the key of the sluice.\nThey went through a little gate from the high-road, to the head of the\nwater, where was a great stone basin which received the overflow, and a\nflight of stone steps descended into the depths of the water itself. At\nthe head of the steps was the lock of the sluice-gate.\n\nThe night was silver-grey and perfect, save for the scattered restless\nsound of voices. The grey sheen of the moonlight caught the stretch of\nwater, dark boats plashed and moved. But Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s mind ceased to be\nreceptive, everything was unimportant and unreal.\n\nBirkin fixed the iron handle of the sluice, and turned it with a\nwrench. The cogs began slowly to rise. He turned and turned, like a\nslave, his white figure became distinct. Ursula looked away. She could\nnot bear to see him winding heavily and laboriously, bending and rising\nmechanically like a slave, turning the handle.\n\nThen, a real shock to her, there came a loud splashing of water from\nout of the dark, tree-filled hollow beyond the road, a splashing that\ndeepened rapidly to a harsh roar, and then became a heavy, booming\nnoise of a great body of water falling solidly all the time. It\noccupied the whole of the night, this great steady booming of water,\neverything was drowned within it, drowned and lost. Ursula seemed to\nhave to struggle for her life. She put her hands over her ears, and\nlooked at the high bland moon.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t we go now?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried to Birkin, who was watching the water on\nthe steps, to see if it would get any lower. It seemed to fascinate\nhim. He looked at her and nodded.\n\nThe little dark boats had moved nearer, people were crowding curiously\nalong the hedge by the high-road, to see what was to be seen. Birkin\nand Ursula went to the cottage with the key, then turned their backs on\nthe lake. She was in great haste. She could not bear the terrible\ncrushing boom of the escaping water.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think they are dead?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried in a high voice, to make\nherself heard.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it horrible!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe paid no heed. They walked up the hill, further and further away from\nthe noise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you mind very much?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mind about the dead,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009conce they are dead.

Better she were dead\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be much more real.\nShe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be positive in death.

I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d rather Diana Crich were dead. Her living somehow, was all\nwrong. As for the young man, poor devil\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll find his way out quickly\ninstead of slowly.

Then he said, in a voice that was frightening\nto her in its change:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI should like to be through with it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I should like to be through with\nthe death process.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula nervously.\n\nThey walked on for some way in silence, under the trees. Then he said,\nslowly, as if afraid:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is life which belongs to death, and there is life which isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ndeath. One is tired of the life that belongs to death\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094our kind of life.\nBut whether it is finished, God knows. I want love that is like sleep,\nlike being born again, vulnerable as a baby that just comes into the\nworld.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula listened, half attentive, half avoiding what he said. She seemed\nto catch the drift of his statement, and then she drew away. She wanted\nto hear, but she did not want to be implicated. She was reluctant to\nyield there, where he wanted her, to yield as it were her very\nidentity.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should love be like sleep?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked sadly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. So that it is like death\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I _do_ want to die from this\nlife\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and yet it is more than life itself. One is delivered over like a\nnaked infant from the womb, all the old defences and the old body gone,\nand new air around one, that has never been breathed before.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe listened, making out what he said. She knew, as well as he knew,\nthat words themselves do not convey meaning, that they are but a\ngesture we make, a dumb show like any other. And she seemed to feel his\ngesture through her blood, and she drew back, even though her desire\nsent her forward.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said gravely, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdidn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you say you wanted something that was\n_not_ love\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094something beyond love?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe turned in confusion. There was always confusion in speech. Yet it\nmust be spoken. Whichever way one moved, if one were to move forwards,\none must break a way through. And to know, to give utterance, was to\nbreak a way through the walls of the prison as the infant in labour\nstrives through the walls of the womb. There is no new movement now,\nwithout the breaking through of the old body, deliberately, in\nknowledge, in the struggle to get out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to know you. I want to be\ngone out of myself, and you to be lost to yourself, so we are found\ndifferent. One shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t talk when one is tired and wretched. One\nHamletises, and it seems a lie. Only believe me when I show you a bit\nof healthy pride and insouciance. I hate myself serious.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you be serious?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe thought for a minute, then he said, sulkily:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Then they walked on in silence, at outs. He was vague\nand lost.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it strange,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, suddenly putting her hand on his arm,\nwith a loving impulse, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chow we always talk like this! I suppose we do\nlove each other, in some way.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ctoo much.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe laughed almost gaily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d have to have it your own way, wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she teased. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\ncould never take it on trust.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe changed, laughed softly, and turned and took her in his arms, in the\nmiddle of the road.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said softly.\n\nAnd he kissed her face and brow, slowly, gently, with a sort of\ndelicate happiness which surprised her extremely, and to which she\ncould not respond. They were soft, blind kisses, perfect in their\nstillness. Yet she held back from them. It was like strange moths, very\nsoft and silent, settling on her from the darkness of her soul. She was\nuneasy. She drew away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t somebody coming?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nSo they looked down the dark road, then set off again walking towards\nBeldover. Then suddenly, to show him she was no shallow prude, she\nstopped and held him tight, hard against her, and covered his face with\nhard, fierce kisses of passion. In spite of his otherness, the old\nblood beat up in him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot this, not this,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he whimpered to himself, as the first perfect\nmood of softness and sleep-loveliness ebbed back away from the rushing\nof passion that came up to his limbs and over his face as she drew him.\nAnd soon he was a perfect hard flame of passionate desire for her. Yet\nin the small core of the flame was an unyielding anguish of another\nthing. But this also was lost; he only wanted her, with an extreme\ndesire that seemed inevitable as death, beyond question.\n\nThen, satisfied and shattered, fulfilled and destroyed, he went home\naway from her, drifting vaguely through the darkness, lapsed into the\nold fire of burning passion. Far away, far away, there seemed to be a\nsmall lament in the darkness. But what did it matter? What did it\nmatter, what did anything matter save this ultimate and triumphant\nexperience of physical passion, that had blazed up anew like a new\nspell of life. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI was becoming quite dead-alive, nothing but a\nword-bag,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said in triumph, scorning his other self. Yet somewhere\nfar off and small, the other hovered.\n\nThe men were still dragging the lake when he got back. He stood on the\nbank and heard Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice. The water was still booming in the\nnight, the moon was fair, the hills beyond were elusive. The lake was\nsinking. There came the raw smell of the banks, in the night air.\n\nUp at Shortlands there were lights in the windows, as if nobody had\ngone to bed. On the landing-stage was the old doctor, the father of the\nyoung man who was lost. He stood quite silent, waiting. Birkin also\nstood and watched, Gerald came up in a boat.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou still here, Rupert?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t get them. The bottom\nslopes, you know, very steep. The water lies between two very sharp\nslopes, with little branch valleys, and God knows where the drift will\ntake you. It isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t as if it was a level bottom. You never know where\nyou are, with the dragging.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs there any need for you to be working?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it be\nmuch better if you went to bed?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTo bed! Good God, do you think I should sleep? We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll find \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099em, before\nI go away from here.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut the men would find them just the same without you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094why should you\ninsist?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked up at him. Then he put his hand affectionately on\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulder, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you bother about me, Rupert. If there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s anybody\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s health to\nthink about, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s yours, not mine. How do you feel yourself?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery well. But you, you spoil your own chance of life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you waste your\nbest self.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald was silent for a moment. Then he said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWaste it? What else is there to do with it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut leave this, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you? You force yourself into horrors, and put a\nmill-stone of beastly memories round your neck. Come away now.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA mill-stone of beastly memories!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald repeated. Then he put his\nhand again affectionately on Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulder. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got such a\ntelling way of putting things, Rupert, you have.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart sank. He was irritated and weary of having a telling way\nof putting things.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you leave it? Come over to my place\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he urged as one urges a\ndrunken man.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald coaxingly, his arm across the other man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulder.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThanks very much, Rupert\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I shall be glad to come tomorrow, if that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll\ndo. You understand, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you? I want to see this job through. But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll\ncome tomorrow, right enough. Oh, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d rather come and have a chat with\nyou than\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094than do anything else, I verily believe. Yes, I would. You\nmean a lot to me, Rupert, more than you know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do I mean, more than I know?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin irritably. He was\nacutely aware of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hand on his shoulder. And he did not want\nthis altercation. He wanted the other man to come out of the ugly\nmisery.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll tell you another time,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald coaxingly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome along with me now\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I want you to come,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nThere was a pause, intense and real. Birkin wondered why his own heart\nbeat so heavily. Then Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s fingers gripped hard and communicative\ninto Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulder, as he said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll see this job through, Rupert. Thank you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I know what you mean.\nWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all right, you know, you and me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI may be all right, but I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not, mucking about here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nBirkin. And he went away.\n\nThe bodies of the dead were not recovered till towards dawn. Diana had\nher arms tight round the neck of the young man, choking him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe killed him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\nThe moon sloped down the sky and sank at last. The lake was sunk to\nquarter size, it had horrible raw banks of clay, that smelled of raw\nrottenish water. Dawn roused faintly behind the eastern hill. The water\nstill boomed through the sluice.\n\nAs the birds were whistling for the first morning, and the hills at the\nback of the desolate lake stood radiant with the new mists, there was a\nstraggling procession up to Shortlands, men bearing the bodies on a\nstretcher, Gerald going beside them, the two grey-bearded fathers\nfollowing in silence. Indoors the family was all sitting up, waiting.\nSomebody must go to tell the mother, in her room. The doctor in secret\nstruggled to bring back his son, till he himself was exhausted.\n\nOver all the outlying district was a hush of dreadful excitement on\nthat Sunday morning. The colliery people felt as if this catastrophe\nhad happened directly to themselves, indeed they were more shocked and\nfrightened than if their own men had been killed. Such a tragedy in\nShortlands, the high home of the district! One of the young mistresses,\npersisting in dancing on the cabin roof of the launch, wilful young\nmadam, drowned in the midst of the festival, with the young doctor!\nEverywhere on the Sunday morning, the colliers wandered about,\ndiscussing the calamity. At all the Sunday dinners of the people, there\nseemed a strange presence. It was as if the angel of death were very\nnear, there was a sense of the supernatural in the air. The men had\nexcited, startled faces, the women looked solemn, some of them had been\ncrying. The children enjoyed the excitement at first. There was an\nintensity in the air, almost magical. Did all enjoy it? Did all enjoy\nthe thrill?\n\nGudrun had wild ideas of rushing to comfort Gerald. She was thinking\nall the time of the perfect comforting, reassuring thing to say to him.\nShe was shocked and frightened, but she put that away, thinking of how\nshe should deport herself with Gerald: act her part. That was the real\nthrill: how she should act her part.\n\nUrsula was deeply and passionately in love with Birkin, and she was\ncapable of nothing. She was perfectly callous about all the talk of the\naccident, but her estranged air looked like trouble. She merely sat by\nherself, whenever she could, and longed to see him again. She wanted\nhim to come to the house,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she would not have it otherwise, he must come\nat once. She was waiting for him. She stayed indoors all day, waiting\nfor him to knock at the door. Every minute, she glanced automatically\nat the window. He would be there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XV.\n\n\n SUNDAY EVENING\n\nAs the day wore on, the life-blood seemed to ebb away from Ursula, and\nwithin the emptiness a heavy despair gathered. Her passion seemed to\nbleed to death, and there was nothing. She sat suspended in a state of\ncomplete nullity, harder to bear than death.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUnless something happens,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself, in the perfect\nlucidity of final suffering, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall die. I am at the end of my line\nof life.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe sat crushed and obliterated in a darkness that was the border of\ndeath. She realised how all her life she had been drawing nearer and\nnearer to this brink, where there was no beyond, from which one had to\nleap like Sappho into the unknown. The knowledge of the imminence of\ndeath was like a drug. Darkly, without thinking at all, she knew that\nshe was near to death. She had travelled all her life along the line of\nfulfilment, and it was nearly concluded. She knew all she had to know,\nshe had experienced all she had to experience, she was fulfilled in a\nkind of bitter ripeness, there remained only to fall from the tree into\ndeath. And one must fulfil one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s development to the end, must carry the\nadventure to its conclusion. And the next step was over the border into\ndeath. So it was then! There was a certain peace in the knowledge.\n\nAfter all, when one was fulfilled, one was happiest in falling into\ndeath, as a bitter fruit plunges in its ripeness downwards. Death is a\ngreat consummation, a consummating experience. It is a development from\nlife. That we know, while we are yet living. What then need we think\nfor further? One can never see beyond the consummation. It is enough\nthat death is a great and conclusive experience. Why should we ask what\ncomes after the experience, when the experience is still unknown to us?\nLet us die, since the great experience is the one that follows now upon\nall the rest, death, which is the next great crisis in front of which\nwe have arrived. If we wait, if we baulk the issue, we do but hang\nabout the gates in undignified uneasiness. There it is, in front of us,\nas in front of Sappho, the illimitable space. Thereinto goes the\njourney. Have we not the courage to go on with our journey, must we cry\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098I daren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099? On ahead we will go, into death, and whatever death may\nmean. If a man can see the next step to be taken, why should he fear\nthe next but one? Why ask about the next but one? Of the next step we\nare certain. It is the step into death.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall die\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I shall quickly die,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula to herself, clear as if\nin a trance, clear, calm, and certain beyond human certainty. But\nsomewhere behind, in the twilight, there was a bitter weeping and a\nhopelessness. That must not be attended to. One must go where the\nunfaltering spirit goes, there must be no baulking the issue, because\nof fear. No baulking the issue, no listening to the lesser voices. If\nthe deepest desire be now, to go on into the unknown of death, shall\none forfeit the deepest truth for one more shallow?\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen let it end,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself. It was a decision. It was not a\nquestion of taking one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she would _never_ kill herself, that was\nrepulsive and violent. It was a question of _knowing_ the nextcstep.\nAnd the next step led into the space of death. Did it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or was there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\n\nHer thoughts drifted into unconsciousness, she sat as if asleep beside\nthe fire. And then the thought came back. The space of death! Could she\ngive herself to it? Ah yes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was a sleep. She had had enough. So long\nshe had held out; and resisted. Now was the time to relinquish, not to\nresist any more.\n\nIn a kind of spiritual trance, she yielded, she gave way, and all was\ndark. She could feel, within the darkness, the terrible assertion of\nher body, the unutterable anguish of dissolution, the only anguish that\nis too much, the far-off, awful nausea of dissolution set in within the\nbody.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoes the body correspond so immediately with the spirit?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked\nherself. And she knew, with the clarity of ultimate knowledge, that the\nbody is only one of the manifestations of the spirit, the transmutation\nof the integral spirit is the transmutation of the physical body as\nwell. Unless I set my will, unless I absolve myself from the rhythm of\nlife, fix myself and remain static, cut off from living, absolved\nwithin my own will. But better die than live mechanically a life that\nis a repetition of repetitions. To die is to move on with the\ninvisible. To die is also a joy, a joy of submitting to that which is\ngreater than the known, namely, the pure unknown. That is a joy. But to\nlive mechanised and cut off within the motion of the will, to live as\nan entity absolved from the unknown, that is shameful and ignominious.\nThere is no ignominy in death. There is complete ignominy in an\nunreplenished, mechanised life. Life indeed may be ignominious,\nshameful to the soul. But death is never a shame. Death itself, like\nthe illimitable space, is beyond our sullying.\n\nTomorrow was Monday. Monday, the beginning of another school-week!\nAnother shameful, barren school-week, mere routine and mechanical\nactivity. Was not the adventure of death infinitely preferable? Was not\ndeath infinitely more lovely and noble than such a life? A life of\nbarren routine, without inner meaning, without any real significance.\nHow sordid life was, how it was a terrible shame to the soul, to live\nnow! How much cleaner and more dignified to be dead! One could not bear\nany more of this shame of sordid routine and mechanical nullity. One\nmight come to fruit in death. She had had enough. For where was life to\nbe found? No flowers grow upon busy machinery, there is no sky to a\nroutine, there is no space to a rotary motion. And all life was a\nrotary motion, mechanised, cut off from reality. There was nothing to\nlook for from life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was the same in all countries and all peoples.\nThe only window was death. One could look out on to the great dark sky\nof death with elation, as one had looked out of the classroom window as\na child, and seen perfect freedom in the outside. Now one was not a\nchild, and one knew that the soul was a prisoner within this sordid\nvast edifice of life, and there was no escape, save in death.\n\nBut what a joy! What a gladness to think that whatever humanity did, it\ncould not seize hold of the kingdom of death, to nullify that. The sea\nthey turned into a murderous alley and a soiled road of commerce,\ndisputed like the dirty land of a city every inch of it. The air they\nclaimed too, shared it up, parcelled it out to certain owners, they\ntrespassed in the air to fight for it. Everything was gone, walled in,\nwith spikes on top of the walls, and one must ignominiously creep\nbetween the spiky walls through a labyrinth of life.\n\nBut the great, dark, illimitable kingdom of death, there humanity was\nput to scorn. So much they could do upon earth, the multifarious little\ngods that they were. But the kingdom of death put them all to scorn,\nthey dwindled into their true vulgar silliness in face of it.\n\nHow beautiful, how grand and perfect death was, how good to look\nforward to. There one would wash off all the lies and ignominy and dirt\nthat had been put upon one here, a perfect bath of cleanness and glad\nrefreshment, and go unknown, unquestioned, unabased. After all, one was\nrich, if only in the promise of perfect death. It was a gladness above\nall, that this remained to look forward to, the pure inhuman otherness\nof death.\n\nWhatever life might be, it could not take away death, the inhuman\ntranscendent death. Oh, let us ask no question of it, what it is or is\nnot. To know is human, and in death we do not know, we are not human.\nAnd the joy of this compensates for all the bitterness of knowledge and\nthe sordidness of our humanity. In death we shall not be human, and we\nshall not know. The promise of this is our heritage, we look forward\nlike heirs to their majority.\n\nUrsula sat quite still and quite forgotten, alone by the fire in the\ndrawing-room. The children were playing in the kitchen, all the others\nwere gone to church. And she was gone into the ultimate darkness of her\nown soul.\n\nShe was startled by hearing the bell ring, away in the kitchen, the\nchildren came scudding along the passage in delicious alarm.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula, there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s somebody.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know. Don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be silly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. She too was startled, almost\nfrightened. She dared hardly go to the door.\n\nBirkin stood on the threshold, his rain-coat turned up to his ears. He\nhad come now, now she was gone far away. She was aware of the rainy\nnight behind him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh is it you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am glad you are at home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said in a low voice, entering the\nhouse.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey are all gone to church.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe took off his coat and hung it up. The children were peeping at him\nround the corner.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo and get undressed now, Billy and Dora,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMother will\nbe back soon, and she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be disappointed if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not in bed.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe children, in a sudden angelic mood, retired without a word. Birkin\nand Ursula went into the drawing-room.\n\nThe fire burned low. He looked at her and wondered at the luminous\ndelicacy of her beauty, and the wide shining of her eyes. He watched\nfrom a distance, with wonder in his heart, she seemed transfigured with\nlight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat have you been doing all day?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOnly sitting about,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe looked at her. There was a change in her. But she was separate from\nhim. She remained apart, in a kind of brightness. They both sat silent\nin the soft light of the lamp. He felt he ought to go away again, he\nought not to have come. Still he did not gather enough resolution to\nmove. But he was _de trop_, her mood was absent and separate.\n\nThen there came the voices of the two children calling shyly outside\nthe door, softly, with self-excited timidity:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula! Ursula!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe rose and opened the door. On the threshold stood the two children\nin their long nightgowns, with wide-eyed, angelic faces. They were\nbeing very good for the moment, playing the r\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b4le perfectly of two\nobedient children.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall you take us to bed!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Billy, in a loud whisper.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy you _are_ angels tonight,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said softly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you come and\nsay good-night to Mr Birkin?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe children merged shyly into the room, on bare feet. Billy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face was\nwide and grinning, but there was a great solemnity of being good in his\nround blue eyes. Dora, peeping from the floss of her fair hair, hung\nback like some tiny Dryad, that has no soul.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you say good-night to me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin, in a voice that was\nstrangely soft and smooth. Dora drifted away at once, like a leaf\nlifted on a breath of wind. But Billy went softly forward, slow and\nwilling, lifting his pinched-up mouth implicitly to be kissed. Ursula\nwatched the full, gathered lips of the man gently touch those of the\nboy, so gently. Then Birkin lifted his fingers and touched the boy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nround, confiding cheek, with a faint touch of love. Neither spoke.\nBilly seemed angelic like a cherub boy, or like an acolyte, Birkin was\na tall, grave angel looking down to him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you going to be kissed?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula broke in, speaking to the little\ngirl. But Dora edged away like a tiny Dryad that will not be touched.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you say good-night to Mr Birkin?

When Ursula came down\nhe sat motionless, with his arms on his knees. She saw him, how he was\nmotionless and ageless, like some crouching idol, some image of a\ndeathly religion. He looked round at her, and his face, very pale and\nunreal, seemed to gleam with a whiteness almost phosphorescent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you feel well?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, in indefinable repulsion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI hadn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t thought about it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you know without thinking about it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at her, his eyes dark and swift, and he saw her revulsion.

When he was\ngone Ursula felt such a poignant hatred of him, that all her brain\nseemed turned into a sharp crystal of fine hatred. Her whole nature\nseemed sharpened and intensified into a pure dart of hate. She could\nnot imagine what it was. It merely took hold of her, the most poignant\nand ultimate hatred, pure and clear and beyond thought. She could not\nthink of it at all, she was translated beyond herself. It was like a\npossession. She felt she was possessed. And for several days she went\nabout possessed by this exquisite force of hatred against him. It\nsurpassed anything she had ever known before, it seemed to throw her\nout of the world into some terrible region where nothing of her old\nlife held good. She was quite lost and dazed, really dead to her own\nlife.\n\nIt was so completely incomprehensible and irrational. She did not know\n_why_ she hated him, her hate was quite abstract. She had only realised\nwith a shock that stunned her, that she was overcome by this pure\ntransportation. He was the enemy, fine as a diamond, and as hard and\njewel-like, the quintessence of all that was inimical.\n\nShe thought of his face, white and purely wrought, and of his eyes that\nhad such a dark, constant will of assertion, and she touched her own\nforehead, to feel if she were mad, she was so transfigured in white\nflame of essential hate.\n\nIt was not temporal, her hatred, she did not hate him for this or for\nthat; she did not want to do anything to him, to have any connection\nwith him. Her relation was ultimate and utterly beyond words, the hate\nwas so pure and gemlike. It was as if he were a beam of essential\nenmity, a beam of light that did not only destroy her, but denied her\naltogether, revoked her whole world. She saw him as a clear stroke of\nuttermost contradiction, a strange gem-like being whose existence\ndefined her own non-existence. When she heard he was ill again, her\nhatred only intensified itself a few degrees, if that were possible. It\nstunned her and annihilated her, but she could not escape it. She could\nnot escape this transfiguration of hatred that had come upon her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XVI.\n\n\n MAN TO MAN\n\nHe lay sick and unmoved, in pure opposition to everything. He knew how\nnear to breaking was the vessel that held his life. He knew also how\nstrong and durable it was. And he did not care. Better a thousand times\ntake one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s chance with death, than accept a life one did not want. But\nbest of all to persist and persist and persist for ever, till one were\nsatisfied in life.\n\nHe knew that Ursula was referred back to him. He knew his life rested\nwith her. But he would rather not live than accept the love she\nproffered. The old way of love seemed a dreadful bondage, a sort of\nconscription. What it was in him he did not know, but the thought of\nlove, marriage, and children, and a life lived together, in the\nhorrible privacy of domestic and connubial satisfaction, was repulsive.\nHe wanted something clearer, more open, cooler, as it were. The hot\nnarrow intimacy between man and wife was abhorrent. The way they shut\ntheir doors, these married people, and shut themselves in to their own\nexclusive alliance with each other, even in love, disgusted him. It was\na whole community of mistrustful couples insulated in private houses or\nprivate rooms, always in couples, and no further life, no further\nimmediate, no disinterested relationship admitted: a kaleidoscope of\ncouples, disjoined, separatist, meaningless entities of married\ncouples. True, he hated promiscuity even worse than marriage, and a\nliaison was only another kind of coupling, reactionary from the legal\nmarriage. Reaction was a greater bore than action.\n\nOn the whole, he hated sex, it was such a limitation. It was sex that\nturned a man into a broken half of a couple, the woman into the other\nbroken half. And he wanted to be single in himself, the woman single in\nherself. He wanted sex to revert to the level of the other appetites,\nto be regarded as a functional process, not as a fulfilment. He\nbelieved in sex marriage. But beyond this, he wanted a further\nconjunction, where man had being and woman had being, two pure beings,\neach constituting the freedom of the other, balancing each other like\ntwo poles of one force, like two angels, or two demons.\n\nHe wanted so much to be free, not under the compulsion of any need for\nunification, or tortured by unsatisfied desire. Desire and aspiration\nshould find their object without all this torture, as now, in a world\nof plenty of water, simple thirst is inconsiderable, satisfied almost\nunconsciously. And he wanted to be with Ursula as free as with himself,\nsingle and clear and cool, yet balanced, polarised with her. The\nmerging, the clutching, the mingling of love was become madly abhorrent\nto him.\n\nBut it seemed to him, woman was always so horrible and clutching, she\nhad such a lust for possession, a greed of self-importance in love. She\nwanted to have, to own, to control, to be dominant. Everything must be\nreferred back to her, to Woman, the Great Mother of everything, out of\nwhom proceeded everything and to whom everything must finally be\nrendered up.\n\nIt filled him with almost insane fury, this calm assumption of the\nMagna Mater, that all was hers, because she had borne it. Man was hers\nbecause she had borne him. A Mater Dolorosa, she had borne him, a Magna\nMater, she now claimed him again, soul and body, sex, meaning, and all.\nHe had a horror of the Magna Mater, she was detestable.\n\nShe was on a very high horse again, was woman, the Great Mother. Did he\nnot know it in Hermione. Hermione, the humble, the subservient, what\nwas she all the while but the Mater Dolorosa, in her subservience,\nclaiming with horrible, insidious arrogance and female tyranny, her own\nagain, claiming back the man she had borne in suffering. By her very\nsuffering and humility she bound her son with chains, she held him her\neverlasting prisoner.\n\nAnd Ursula, Ursula was the same\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or the inverse. She too was the awful,\narrogant queen of life, as if she were a queen bee on whom all the rest\ndepended. He saw the yellow flare in her eyes, he knew the unthinkable\noverweening assumption of primacy in her. She was unconscious of it\nherself. She was only too ready to knock her head on the ground before\na man. But this was only when she was so certain of her man, that she\ncould worship him as a woman worships her own infant, with a worship of\nperfect possession.\n\nIt was intolerable, this possession at the hands of woman. Always a man\nmust be considered as the broken off fragment of a woman, and the sex\nwas the still aching scar of the laceration. Man must be added on to a\nwoman, before he had any real place or wholeness.\n\nAnd why? Why should we consider ourselves, men and women, as broken\nfragments of one whole? It is not true. We are not broken fragments of\none whole. Rather we are the singling away into purity and clear being,\nof things that were mixed. Rather the sex is that which remains in us\nof the mixed, the unresolved. And passion is the further separating of\nthis mixture, that which is manly being taken into the being of the\nman, that which is womanly passing to the woman, till the two are clear\nand whole as angels, the admixture of sex in the highest sense\nsurpassed, leaving two single beings constellated together like two\nstars.\n\nIn the old age, before sex was, we were mixed, each one a mixture. The\nprocess of singling into individuality resulted into the great\npolarisation of sex. The womanly drew to one side, the manly to the\nother. But the separation was imperfect even them. And so our\nworld-cycle passes. There is now to come the new day, when we are\nbeings each of us, fulfilled in difference. The man is pure man, the\nwoman pure woman, they are perfectly polarised. But there is no longer\nany of the horrible merging, mingling self-abnegation of love. There is\nonly the pure duality of polarisation, each one free from any\ncontamination of the other. In each, the individual is primal, sex is\nsubordinate, but perfectly polarised. Each has a single, separate\nbeing, with its own laws. The man has his pure freedom, the woman hers.\nEach acknowledges the perfection of the polarised sex-circuit. Each\nadmits the different nature in the other.\n\nSo Birkin meditated whilst he was ill. He liked sometimes to be ill\nenough to take to his bed. For then he got better very quickly, and\nthings came to him clear and sure.\n\nWhilst he was laid up, Gerald came to see him. The two men had a deep,\nuneasy feeling for each other. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes were quick and restless,\nhis whole manner tense and impatient, he seemed strung up to some\nactivity. According to conventionality, he wore black clothes, he\nlooked formal, handsome and _comme il faut_. His hair was fair almost\nto whiteness, sharp like splinters of light, his face was keen and\nruddy, his body seemed full of northern energy. Gerald really loved\nBirkin, though he never quite believed in him. Birkin was too\nunreal;\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094clever, whimsical, wonderful, but not practical enough. Gerald\nfelt that his own understanding was much sounder and safer. Birkin was\ndelightful, a wonderful spirit, but after all, not to be taken\nseriously, not quite to be counted as a man among men.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy are you laid up again?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked kindly, taking the sick man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nhand. It was always Gerald who was protective, offering the warm\nshelter of his physical strength.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFor my sins, I suppose,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Birkin said, smiling a little ironically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFor your sins? Yes, probably that is so. You should sin less, and keep\nbetter in health?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better teach me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at Gerald with ironic eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow are things with you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWith me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald looked at Birkin, saw he was serious, and a warm\nlight came into his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know that they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re any different.

She was driving the\ncattle up the hill, and I went after her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you remember.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I remember.

No, not that I know of. I merely said to her, that it was dangerous\nto drive those Highland bullocks\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094as it _is_. She turned in such a way,\nand said\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098I suppose you think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m afraid of you and your cattle, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nyou?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 So I asked her \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098why,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 and for answer she flung me a back-hander\nacross the face.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin laughed quickly, as if it pleased him.

I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t quite account for it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care if you die or not?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin.\n\nGerald looked at him with eyes blue as the blue-fibred steel of a\nweapon. He felt awkward, but indifferent. As a matter of fact, he did\ncare terribly, with a great fear.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to die, why should I? But I never trouble.\nThe question doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t seem to be on the carpet for me at all. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ninterest me, you know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Timor mortis conturbat me_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d quoted Birkin, adding\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, death doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nreally seem the point any more. It curiously doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t concern one. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nlike an ordinary tomorrow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked closely at his friend. The eyes of the two men met, and\nan unspoken understanding was exchanged.\n\nGerald narrowed his eyes, his face was cool and unscrupulous as he\nlooked at Birkin, impersonally, with a vision that ended in a point in\nspace, strangely keen-eyed and yet blind.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf death isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the point,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a strangely abstract, cold,\nfine voice\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat is?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He sounded as if he had been found out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d re-echoed Birkin. And there was a mocking silence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s long way to go, after the point of intrinsic death, before we\ndisappear,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut what sort of way?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He seemed to press the\nother man for knowledge which he himself knew far better than Birkin\ndid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRight down the slopes of degeneration\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094mystic, universal degeneration.\nThere are many stages of pure degradation to go through: agelong. We\nlive on long after our death, and progressively, in progressive\ndevolution.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald listened with a faint, fine smile on his face, all the time, as\nif, somewhere, he knew so much better than Birkin, all about this: as\nif his own knowledge were direct and personal, whereas Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s was a\nmatter of observation and inference, not quite hitting the nail on the\nhead:\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094though aiming near enough at it. But he was not going to give\nhimself away. If Birkin could get at the secrets, let him. Gerald would\nnever help him. Gerald would be a dark horse to the end.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, with a startling change of conversation, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit is\nfather who really feels it. It will finish him. For him the world\ncollapses. All his care now is for Winnie\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he must save Winnie. He says\nshe ought to be sent away to school, but she won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hear of it, and\nhe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll never do it. Of course she _is_ in rather a queer way. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all\nof us curiously bad at living. We can do things\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but we can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t get on\nwith life at all. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s curious\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a family failing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe oughtn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t to be sent away to school,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, who was\nconsidering a new proposition.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe oughtn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. Why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a queer child\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a special child, more special even than you. And\nin my opinion special children should never be sent away to school.\nOnly moderately ordinary children should be sent to school\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so it seems\nto me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m inclined to think just the opposite. I think it would probably\nmake her more normal if she went away and mixed with other children.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mix, you see. _You_ never really mixed, did you? And she\nwouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be willing even to pretend to. She\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s proud, and solitary, and\nnaturally apart. If she has a single nature, why do you want to make\nher gregarious?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to make her anything. But I think school would be\ngood for her.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it good for you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes narrowed uglily. School had been torture to him. Yet he\nhad not questioned whether one should go through this torture. He\nseemed to believe in education through subjection and torment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI hated it at the time, but I can see it was necessary,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\nbrought me into line a bit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t live unless you do come into\nline somewhere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI begin to think that you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t live unless you\nkeep entirely out of the line. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no good trying to toe the line,\nwhen your one impulse is to smash up the line. Winnie is a special\nnature, and for special natures you must give a special world.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, but where\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s your special world?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMake it. Instead of chopping yourself down to fit the world, chop the\nworld down to fit yourself. As a matter of fact, two exceptional people\nmake another world. You and I, we make another, separate world. You\ndon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _want_ a world same as your brothers-in-law. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s just the\nspecial quality you value. Do you _want_ to be normal or ordinary! It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\na lie. You want to be free and extraordinary, in an extraordinary world\nof liberty.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked at Birkin with subtle eyes of knowledge. But he would\nnever openly admit what he felt. He knew more than Birkin, in one\ndirection\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094much more. And this gave him his gentle love for the other\nman, as if Birkin were in some way young, innocent, child-like: so\namazingly clever, but incurably innocent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYet you are so banal as to consider me chiefly a freak,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin\npointedly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA freak!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Gerald, startled. And his face opened suddenly, as\nif lighted with simplicity, as when a flower opens out of the cunning\nbud. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I never consider you a freak.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And he watched the other man\nwith strange eyes, that Birkin could not understand. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI feel,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald\ncontinued, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat there is always an element of uncertainty about\nyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094perhaps you are uncertain about yourself. But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m never sure of\nyou. You can go away and change as easily as if you had no soul.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at Birkin with penetrating eyes. Birkin was amazed. He\nthought he had all the soul in the world. He stared in amazement. And\nGerald, watching, saw the amazing attractive goodliness of his eyes, a\nyoung, spontaneous goodness that attracted the other man infinitely,\nyet filled him with bitter chagrin, because he mistrusted it so much.\nHe knew Birkin could do without him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094could forget, and not suffer. This\nwas always present in Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s consciousness, filling him with bitter\nunbelief: this consciousness of the young, animal-like spontaneity of\ndetachment. It seemed almost like hypocrisy and lying, sometimes, oh,\noften, on Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s part, to talk so deeply and importantly.\n\nQuite other things were going through Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s mind. Suddenly he saw\nhimself confronted with another problem\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the problem of love and eternal\nconjunction between two men. Of course this was necessary\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it had been a\nnecessity inside himself all his life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094to love a man purely and fully.\nOf course he had been loving Gerald all along, and all along denying\nit.\n\nHe lay in the bed and wondered, whilst his friend sat beside him, lost\nin brooding. Each man was gone in his own thoughts.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou know how the old German knights used to swear a\n_Blutbruderschaft_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to Gerald, with quite a new happy activity\nin his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMake a little wound in their arms, and rub each other\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood into the\ncut?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and swear to be true to each other, of one blood, all their lives.\nThat is what we ought to do. No wounds, that is obsolete. But we ought\nto swear to love each other, you and I, implicitly, and perfectly,\nfinally, without any possibility of going back on it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at Gerald with clear, happy eyes of discovery. Gerald looked\ndown at him, attracted, so deeply bondaged in fascinated attraction,\nthat he was mistrustful, resenting the bondage, hating the attraction.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will swear to each other, one day, shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d pleaded Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\nwill swear to stand by each other\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094be true to each\nother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ultimately\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094infallibly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094given to each other, organically\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094without\npossibility of taking back.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin sought hard to express himself. But Gerald hardly listened. His\nface shone with a certain luminous pleasure. He was pleased. But he\nkept his reserve. He held himself back.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we swear to each other, one day?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, putting out his\nhand towards Gerald.\n\nGerald just touched the extended fine, living hand, as if withheld and\nafraid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll leave it till I understand it better,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a voice of\nexcuse.\n\nBirkin watched him. A little sharp disappointment, perhaps a touch of\ncontempt came into his heart.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou must tell me what you think, later. You know what\nI mean? Not sloppy emotionalism. An impersonal union that leaves one\nfree.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey lapsed both into silence. Birkin was looking at Gerald all the\ntime. He seemed now to see, not the physical, animal man, which he\nusually saw in Gerald, and which usually he liked so much, but the man\nhimself, complete, and as if fated, doomed, limited. This strange sense\nof fatality in Gerald, as if he were limited to one form of existence,\none knowledge, one activity, a sort of fatal halfness, which to himself\nseemed wholeness, always overcame Birkin after their moments of\npassionate approach, and filled him with a sort of contempt, or\nboredom. It was the insistence on the limitation which so bored Birkin\nin Gerald. Gerald could never fly away from himself, in real\nindifferent gaiety. He had a clog, a sort of monomania.\n\nThere was silence for a time. Then Birkin said, in a lighter tone,\nletting the stress of the contact pass:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you get a good governess for Winifred?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094somebody exceptional?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHermione Roddice suggested we should ask Gudrun to teach her to draw\nand to model in clay. You know Winnie is astonishingly clever with that\nplasticine stuff. Hermione declares she is an artist.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald spoke in\nthe usual animated, chatty manner, as if nothing unusual had passed.\nBut Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s manner was full of reminder.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally! I didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know that. Oh well then, if Gudrun _would_ teach her,\nit would be perfect\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be anything better\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if Winifred is an\nartist. Because Gudrun somewhere is one. And every true artist is the\nsalvation of every other.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI thought they got on so badly, as a rule.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps. But only artists produce for each other the world that is fit\nto live in. If you can arrange _that_ for Winifred, it is perfect.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut you think she wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. Gudrun is rather self-opinionated. She won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go cheap\nanywhere. Or if she does, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll pretty soon take herself back. So\nwhether she would condescend to do private teaching, particularly here,\nin Beldover, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. But it would be just the thing. Winifred has\ngot a special nature. And if you can put into her way the means of\nbeing self-sufficient, that is the best thing possible. She\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll never\nget on with the ordinary life. You find it difficult enough yourself,\nand she is several skins thinner than you are. It is awful to think\nwhat her life will be like unless she does find a means of expression,\nsome way of fulfilment. You can see what mere leaving it to fate\nbrings. You can see how much marriage is to be trusted to\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094look at your\nown mother.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think mother is abnormal?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo! I think she only wanted something more, or other than the common\nrun of life. And not getting it, she has gone wrong perhaps.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAfter producing a brood of wrong children,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald gloomily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo more wrong than any of the rest of us,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Birkin replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe most\nnormal people have the worst subterranean selves, take them one by\none.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSometimes I think it is a curse to be alive,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald with sudden\nimpotent anger.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhy not! Let it be a curse sometimes to be\nalive\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094at other times it is anything but a curse. You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got plenty of\nzest in it really.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLess than you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d think,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, revealing a strange poverty in\nhis look at the other man.\n\nThere was silence, each thinking his own thoughts.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see what she has to distinguish between teaching at the\nGrammar School, and coming to teach Win,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe difference between a public servant and a private one. The only\nnobleman today, king and only aristocrat, is the public, the public.\nYou are quite willing to serve the public\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but to be a private tutor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to serve either\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo! And Gudrun will probably feel the same.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald thought for a few minutes. Then he said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAt all events, father won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t make her feel like a private servant. He\nwill be fussy and greatful enough.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo he ought. And so ought all of you. Do you think you can hire a\nwoman like Gudrun Brangwen with money? She is your equal like\nanything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094probably your superior.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs she?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, and if you haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the guts to know it, I hope she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll leave you\nto your own devices.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNevertheless,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cif she is my equal, I wish she weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a\nteacher, because I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think teachers as a rule are my equal.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNor do I, damn them. But am I a teacher because I teach, or a parson\nbecause I preach?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald laughed. He was always uneasy on this score. He did not _want_\nto claim social superiority, yet he _would_ not claim intrinsic\npersonal superiority, because he would never base his standard of\nvalues on pure being. So he wobbled upon a tacit assumption of social\nstanding. No, Birkin wanted him to accept the fact of intrinsic\ndifference between human beings, which he did not intend to accept. It\nwas against his social honour, his principle. He rose to go.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been neglecting my business all this while,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said smiling.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI ought to have reminded you before,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Birkin replied, laughing and\nmocking.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI knew you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d say something like that,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d laughed Gerald, rather\nuneasily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, Rupert. It wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do for us all to be like you are\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we should\nsoon be in the cart. When I am above the world, I shall ignore all\nbusinesses.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not in the cart now,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, satirically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot as much as you make out. At any rate, we have enough to eat and\ndrink\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd be satisfied,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d added Birkin.\n\nGerald came near the bed and stood looking down at Birkin whose throat\nwas exposed, whose tossed hair fell attractively on the warm brow,\nabove the eyes that were so unchallenged and still in the satirical\nface. Gerald, full-limbed and turgid with energy, stood unwilling to\ngo, he was held by the presence of the other man. He had not the power\nto go away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And he reached out his hand from under\nthe bed-clothes, smiling with a glimmering look.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, taking the warm hand of his friend in a firm\ngrasp. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall come again. I miss you down at the mill.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be there in a few days,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nThe eyes of the two men met again. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, that were keen as a\nhawk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, were suffused now with warm light and with unadmitted love,\nBirkin looked back as out of a darkness, unsounded and unknown, yet\nwith a kind of warmth, that seemed to flow over Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s brain like a\nfertile sleep.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye then. There\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nothing I can do for you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNothing, thanks.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin watched the black-clothed form of the other man move out of the\ndoor, the bright head was gone, he turned over to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XVII.\n\n\n THE INDUSTRIAL MAGNATE\n\nIn Beldover, there was both for Ursula and for Gudrun an interval. It\nseemed to Ursula as if Birkin had gone out of her for the time, he had\nlost his significance, he scarcely mattered in her world. She had her\nown friends, her own activities, her own life. She turned back to the\nold ways with zest, away from him.\n\nAnd Gudrun, after feeling every moment in all her veins conscious of\nGerald Crich, connected even physically with him, was now almost\nindifferent to the thought of him. She was nursing new schemes for\ngoing away and trying a new form of life. All the time, there was\nsomething in her urging her to avoid the final establishing of a\nrelationship with Gerald. She felt it would be wiser and better to have\nno more than a casual acquaintance with him.\n\nShe had a scheme for going to St Petersburg, where she had a friend who\nwas a sculptor like herself, and who lived with a wealthy Russian whose\nhobby was jewel-making. The emotional, rather rootless life of the\nRussians appealed to her. She did not want to go to Paris. Paris was\ndry, and essentially boring. She would like to go to Rome, Munich,\nVienna, or to St Petersburg or Moscow. She had a friend in St\nPetersburg and a friend in Munich. To each of these she wrote, asking\nabout rooms.\n\nShe had a certain amount of money. She had come home partly to save,\nand now she had sold several pieces of work, she had been praised in\nvarious shows. She knew she could become quite the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cgo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 if she went to\nLondon. But she knew London, she wanted something else. She had seventy\npounds, of which nobody knew anything. She would move soon, as soon as\nshe heard from her friends. Her nature, in spite of her apparent\nplacidity and calm, was profoundly restless.\n\nThe sisters happened to call in a cottage in Willey Green to buy honey.\nMrs Kirk, a stout, pale, sharp-nosed woman, sly, honied, with something\nshrewish and cat-like beneath, asked the girls into her too cosy, too\ntidy kitchen. There was a cat-like comfort and cleanliness everywhere.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, Miss Brangwen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her slightly whining, insinuating\nvoice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand how do you like being back in the old place, then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun, whom she addressed, hated her at once.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care for it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied abruptly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t? Ay, well, I suppose you found a difference from London. You\nlike life, and big, grand places. Some of us has to be content with\nWilley Green and Beldover. And what do you think of our Grammar School,\nas there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s so much talk about?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do I think of it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun looked round at her slowly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you\nmean, do I think it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a good school?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes. What is your opinion of it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI _do_ think it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a good school.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun was very cold and repelling. She knew the common people hated\nthe school.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAy, you do, then! I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve heard so much, one way and the other. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nice\nto know what those that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s in it feel. But opinions vary, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they? Mr\nCrich up at Highclose is all for it. Ay, poor man, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m afraid he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not\nlong for this world.

I can remember the rows she had\nwith Mr Crich, my word. When he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d got worked up, properly worked up\ntill he could stand no more, he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d lock the study door and whip them.\nBut she paced up and down all the while like a tiger outside, like a\ntiger, with very murder in her face. She had a face that could _look_\ndeath. And when the door was opened, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d go in with her hands\nlifted\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098What have you been doing to _my_ children, you coward.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 She was\nlike one out of her mind. I believe he was frightened of her; he had to\nbe driven mad before he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d lift a finger. Didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t the servants have a\nlife of it!

If you wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t let them smash their pots on\nthe table, if you wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t let them drag the kitten about with a string\nround its neck, if you wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t give them whatever they asked for,\nevery mortal thing\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then there was a shine on, and their mother coming\nin asking\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098What\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the matter with him? What have you done to him? What\nis it, Darling?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 And then she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d turn on you as if she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d trample you\nunder her feet. But she didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t trample on me. I was the only one that\ncould do anything with her demons\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094for she wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t going to be bothered\nwith them herself. No, _she_ took no trouble for them. But they must\njust have their way, they mustn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be spoken to. And Master Gerald was\nthe beauty. I left when he was a year and a half, I could stand no\nmore. But I pinched his little bottom for him when he was in arms, I\ndid, when there was no holding him, and I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not sorry I did\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun went away in fury and loathing. The phrase, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI pinched his\nlittle bottom for him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sent her into a white, stony fury. She could\nnot bear it, she wanted to have the woman taken out at once and\nstrangled. And yet there the phrase was lodged in her mind for ever,\nbeyond escape. She felt, one day, she would _have_ to tell him, to see\nhow he took it. And she loathed herself for the thought.\n\nBut at Shortlands the life-long struggle was coming to a close. The\nfather was ill and was going to die. He had bad internal pains, which\ntook away all his attentive life, and left him with only a vestige of\nhis consciousness. More and more a silence came over him, he was less\nand less acutely aware of his surroundings. The pain seemed to absorb\nhis activity. He knew it was there, he knew it would come again. It was\nlike something lurking in the darkness within him. And he had not the\npower, or the will, to seek it out and to know it. There it remained in\nthe darkness, the great pain, tearing him at times, and then being\nsilent. And when it tore him he crouched in silent subjection under it,\nand when it left him alone again, he refused to know of it. It was\nwithin the darkness, let it remain unknown. So he never admitted it,\nexcept in a secret corner of himself, where all his never-revealed\nfears and secrets were accumulated. For the rest, he had a pain, it\nwent away, it made no difference. It even stimulated him, excited him.\n\nBut it gradually absorbed his life. Gradually it drew away all his\npotentiality, it bled him into the dark, it weaned him of life and drew\nhim away into the darkness. And in this twilight of his life little\nremained visible to him. The business, his work, that was gone\nentirely. His public interests had disappeared as if they had never\nbeen. Even his family had become extraneous to him, he could only\nremember, in some slight non-essential part of himself, that such and\nsuch were his children. But it was historical fact, not vital to him.\nHe had to make an effort to know their relation to him. Even his wife\nbarely existed. She indeed was like the darkness, like the pain within\nhim. By some strange association, the darkness that contained the pain\nand the darkness that contained his wife were identical. All his\nthoughts and understandings became blurred and fused, and now his wife\nand the consuming pain were the same dark secret power against him,\nthat he never faced. He never drove the dread out of its lair within\nhim. He only knew that there was a dark place, and something inhabiting\nthis darkness which issued from time to time and rent him. But he dared\nnot penetrate and drive the beast into the open. He had rather ignore\nits existence. Only, in his vague way, the dread was his wife, the\ndestroyer, and it was the pain, the destruction, a darkness which was\none and both.\n\nHe very rarely saw his wife. She kept her room. Only occasionally she\ncame forth, with her head stretched forward, and in her low, possessed\nvoice, she asked him how he was. And he answered her, in the habit of\nmore than thirty years: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m any the worse, dear.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nBut he was frightened of her, underneath this safeguard of habit,\nfrightened almost to the verge of death.\n\nBut all his life, he had been so constant to his lights, he had never\nbroken down. He would die even now without breaking down, without\nknowing what his feelings were, towards her. All his life, he had said:\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPoor Christiana, she has such a strong temper.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d With unbroken will, he\nhad stood by this position with regard to her, he had substituted pity\nfor all his hostility, pity had been his shield and his safeguard, and\nhis infallible weapon. And still, in his consciousness, he was sorry\nfor her, her nature was so violent and so impatient.\n\nBut now his pity, with his life, was wearing thin, and the dread almost\namounting to horror, was rising into being. But before the armour of\nhis pity really broke, he would die, as an insect when its shell is\ncracked. This was his final resource. Others would live on, and know\nthe living death, the ensuing process of hopeless chaos. He would not.\nHe denied death its victory.\n\nHe had been so constant to his lights, so constant to charity, and to\nhis love for his neighbour. Perhaps he had loved his neighbour even\nbetter than himself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094which is going one further than the commandment.\nAlways, this flame had burned in his heart, sustaining him through\neverything, the welfare of the people. He was a large employer of\nlabour, he was a great mine-owner. And he had never lost this from his\nheart, that in Christ he was one with his workmen. Nay, he had felt\ninferior to them, as if they through poverty and labour were nearer to\nGod than he. He had always the unacknowledged belief, that it was his\nworkmen, the miners, who held in their hands the means of salvation. To\nmove nearer to God, he must move towards his miners, his life must\ngravitate towards theirs. They were, unconsciously, his idol, his God\nmade manifest. In them he worshipped the highest, the great,\nsympathetic, mindless Godhead of humanity.\n\nAnd all the while, his wife had opposed him like one of the great\ndemons of hell. Strange, like a bird of prey, with the fascinating\nbeauty and abstraction of a hawk, she had beat against the bars of his\nphilanthropy, and like a hawk in a cage, she had sunk into silence. By\nforce of circumstance, because all the world combined to make the cage\nunbreakable, he had been too strong for her, he had kept her prisoner.\nAnd because she was his prisoner, his passion for her had always\nremained keen as death. He had always loved her, loved her with\nintensity. Within the cage, she was denied nothing, she was given all\nlicence.\n\nBut she had gone almost mad. Of wild and overweening temper, she could\nnot bear the humiliation of her husband\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soft, half-appealing kindness\nto everybody. He was not deceived by the poor. He knew they came and\nsponged on him, and whined to him, the worse sort; the majority,\nluckily for him, were much too proud to ask for anything, much too\nindependent to come knocking at his door. But in Beldover, as\neverywhere else, there were the whining, parasitic, foul human beings\nwho come crawling after charity, and feeding on the living body of the\npublic like lice. A kind of fire would go over Christiana Crich\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nbrain, as she saw two more pale-faced, creeping women in objectionable\nblack clothes, cringing lugubriously up the drive to the door. She\nwanted to set the dogs on them, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHi Rip! Hi Ring! Ranger! At \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099em boys,\nset \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099em off.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d But Crowther, the butler, with all the rest of the\nservants, was Mr Crich\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s man. Nevertheless, when her husband was away,\nshe would come down like a wolf on the crawling supplicants:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you people want? There is nothing for you here. You have no\nbusiness on the drive at all. Simpson, drive them away and let no more\nof them through the gate.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe servants had to obey her. And she would stand watching with an eye\nlike the eagle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, whilst the groom in clumsy confusion drove the\nlugubrious persons down the drive, as if they were rusty fowls,\nscuttling before him.\n\nBut they learned to know, from the lodge-keeper, when Mrs Crich was\naway, and they timed their visits. How many times, in the first years,\nwould Crowther knock softly at the door: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerson to see you, sir.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat name?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGrocock, sir.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do they want?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The question was half impatient, half gratified.\nHe liked hearing appeals to his charity.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAbout a child, sir.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShow them into the library, and tell them they shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come after\neleven o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock in the morning.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do you get up from dinner?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094send them off,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d his wife would say\nabruptly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t do that.

How is your Missis?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sunk very low, Mester Crich, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099most gone, she is\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSometimes, it seemed to Mrs Crich as if her husband were some subtle\nfuneral bird, feeding on the miseries of the people. It seemed to her\nhe was never satisfied unless there was some sordid tale being poured\nout to him, which he drank in with a sort of mournful, sympathetic\nsatisfaction. He would have no _raison d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00aatre_ if there were no\nlugubrious miseries in the world, as an undertaker would have no\nmeaning if there were no funerals.\n\nMrs Crich recoiled back upon herself, she recoiled away from this world\nof creeping democracy. A band of tight, baleful exclusion fastened\nround her heart, her isolation was fierce and hard, her antagonism was\npassive but terribly pure, like that of a hawk in a cage. As the years\nwent on, she lost more and more count of the world, she seemed rapt in\nsome glittering abstraction, almost purely unconscious. She would\nwander about the house and about the surrounding country, staring\nkeenly and seeing nothing. She rarely spoke, she had no connection with\nthe world. And she did not even think. She was consumed in a fierce\ntension of opposition, like the negative pole of a magnet.\n\nAnd she bore many children. For, as time went on, she never opposed her\nhusband in word or deed. She took no notice of him, externally. She\nsubmitted to him, let him take what he wanted and do as he wanted with\nher. She was like a hawk that sullenly submits to everything. The\nrelation between her and her husband was wordless and unknown, but it\nwas deep, awful, a relation of utter inter-destruction. And he, who\ntriumphed in the world, he became more and more hollow in his vitality,\nthe vitality was bled from within him, as by some h\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6morrhage. She was\nhulked like a hawk in a cage, but her heart was fierce and undiminished\nwithin her, though her mind was destroyed.\n\nSo to the last he would go to her and hold her in his arms sometimes,\nbefore his strength was all gone. The terrible white, destructive light\nthat burned in her eyes only excited and roused him. Till he was bled\nto death, and then he dreaded her more than anything. But he always\nsaid to himself, how happy he had been, how he had loved her with a\npure and consuming love ever since he had known her. And he thought of\nher as pure, chaste; the white flame which was known to him alone, the\nflame of her sex, was a white flower of snow to his mind. She was a\nwonderful white snow-flower, which he had desired infinitely. And now\nhe was dying with all his ideas and interpretations intact. They would\nonly collapse when the breath left his body. Till then they would be\npure truths for him. Only death would show the perfect completeness of\nthe lie. Till death, she was his white snow-flower. He had subdued her,\nand her subjugation was to him an infinite chastity in her, a virginity\nwhich he could never break, and which dominated him as by a spell.\n\nShe had let go the outer world, but within herself she was unbroken and\nunimpaired. She only sat in her room like a moping, dishevelled hawk,\nmotionless, mindless. Her children, for whom she had been so fierce in\nher youth, now meant scarcely anything to her. She had lost all that,\nshe was quite by herself. Only Gerald, the gleaming, had some existence\nfor her. But of late years, since he had become head of the business,\nhe too was forgotten. Whereas the father, now he was dying, turned for\ncompassion to Gerald. There had always been opposition between the two\nof them. Gerald had feared and despised his father, and to a great\nextent had avoided him all through boyhood and young manhood. And the\nfather had felt very often a real dislike of his eldest son, which,\nnever wanting to give way to, he had refused to acknowledge. He had\nignored Gerald as much as possible, leaving him alone.\n\nSince, however, Gerald had come home and assumed responsibility in the\nfirm, and had proved such a wonderful director, the father, tired and\nweary of all outside concerns, had put all his trust of these things in\nhis son, implicitly, leaving everything to him, and assuming a rather\ntouching dependence on the young enemy. This immediately roused a\npoignant pity and allegiance in Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart, always shadowed by\ncontempt and by unadmitted enmity. For Gerald was in reaction against\nCharity; and yet he was dominated by it, it assumed supremacy in the\ninner life, and he could not confute it. So he was partly subject to\nthat which his father stood for, but he was in reaction against it. Now\nhe could not save himself. A certain pity and grief and tenderness for\nhis father overcame him, in spite of the deeper, more sullen hostility.\n\nThe father won shelter from Gerald through compassion. But for love he\nhad Winifred. She was his youngest child, she was the only one of his\nchildren whom he had ever closely loved. And her he loved with all the\ngreat, overweening, sheltering love of a dying man. He wanted to\nshelter her infinitely, infinitely, to wrap her in warmth and love and\nshelter, perfectly. If he could save her she should never know one\npain, one grief, one hurt. He had been so right all his life, so\nconstant in his kindness and his goodness. And this was his last\npassionate righteousness, his love for the child Winifred. Some things\ntroubled him yet. The world had passed away from him, as his strength\nebbed. There were no more poor and injured and humble to protect and\nsuccour. These were all lost to him. There were no more sons and\ndaughters to trouble him, and to weigh on him as an unnatural\nresponsibility. These too had faded out of reality. All these things\nhad fallen out of his hands, and left him free.\n\nThere remained the covert fear and horror of his wife, as she sat\nmindless and strange in her room, or as she came forth with slow,\nprowling step, her head bent forward. But this he put away. Even his\nlife-long righteousness, however, would not quite deliver him from the\ninner horror. Still, he could keep it sufficiently at bay. It would\nnever break forth openly. Death would come first.\n\nThen there was Winifred! If only he could be sure about her, if only he\ncould be sure. Since the death of Diana, and the development of his\nillness, his craving for surety with regard to Winifred amounted almost\nto obsession. It was as if, even dying, he must have some anxiety, some\nresponsibility of love, of Charity, upon his heart.\n\nShe was an odd, sensitive, inflammable child, having her father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dark\nhair and quiet bearing, but being quite detached, momentaneous. She was\nlike a changeling indeed, as if her feelings did not matter to her,\nreally. She often seemed to be talking and playing like the gayest and\nmost childish of children, she was full of the warmest, most delightful\naffection for a few things\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094for her father, and for her animals in\nparticular. But if she heard that her beloved kitten Leo had been run\nover by the motor-car she put her head on one side, and replied, with a\nfaint contraction like resentment on her face: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHas he?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Then she took\nno more notice. She only disliked the servant who would force bad news\non her, and wanted her to be sorry. She wished not to know, and that\nseemed her chief motive. She avoided her mother, and most of the\nmembers of her family. She _loved_ her Daddy, because he wanted her\nalways to be happy, and because he seemed to become young again, and\nirresponsible in her presence. She liked Gerald, because he was so\nself-contained. She loved people who would make life a game for her.\nShe had an amazing instinctive critical faculty, and was a pure\nanarchist, a pure aristocrat at once. For she accepted her equals\nwherever she found them, and she ignored with blithe indifference her\ninferiors, whether they were her brothers and sisters, or whether they\nwere wealthy guests of the house, or whether they were the common\npeople or the servants. She was quite single and by herself, deriving\nfrom nobody. It was as if she were cut off from all purpose or\ncontinuity, and existed simply moment by moment.\n\nThe father, as by some strange final illusion, felt as if all his fate\ndepended on his ensuring to Winifred her happiness. She who could never\nsuffer, because she never formed vital connections, she who could lose\nthe dearest things of her life and be just the same the next day, the\nwhole memory dropped out, as if deliberately, she whose will was so\nstrangely and easily free, anarchistic, almost nihilistic, who like a\nsoulless bird flits on its own will, without attachment or\nresponsibility beyond the moment, who in her every motion snapped the\nthreads of serious relationship with blithe, free hands, really\nnihilistic, because never troubled, she must be the object of her\nfather\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s final passionate solicitude.\n\nWhen Mr Crich heard that Gudrun Brangwen might come to help Winifred\nwith her drawing and modelling he saw a road to salvation for his\nchild. He believed that Winifred had talent, he had seen Gudrun, he\nknew that she was an exceptional person. He could give Winifred into\nher hands as into the hands of a right being. Here was a direction and\na positive force to be lent to his child, he need not leave her\ndirectionless and defenceless. If he could but graft the girl on to\nsome tree of utterance before he died, he would have fulfilled his\nresponsibility. And here it could be done. He did not hesitate to\nappeal to Gudrun.\n\nMeanwhile, as the father drifted more and more out of life, Gerald\nexperienced more and more a sense of exposure. His father after all had\nstood for the living world to him. Whilst his father lived Gerald was\nnot responsible for the world. But now his father was passing away,\nGerald found himself left exposed and unready before the storm of\nliving, like the mutinous first mate of a ship that has lost his\ncaptain, and who sees only a terrible chaos in front of him. He did not\ninherit an established order and a living idea. The whole unifying idea\nof mankind seemed to be dying with his father, the centralising force\nthat had held the whole together seemed to collapse with his father,\nthe parts were ready to go asunder in terrible disintegration. Gerald\nwas as if left on board of a ship that was going asunder beneath his\nfeet, he was in charge of a vessel whose timbers were all coming apart.\n\nHe knew that all his life he had been wrenching at the frame of life to\nbreak it apart. And now, with something of the terror of a destructive\nchild, he saw himself on the point of inheriting his own destruction.\nAnd during the last months, under the influence of death, and of\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s talk, and of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s penetrating being, he had lost entirely\nthat mechanical certainty that had been his triumph. Sometimes spasms\nof hatred came over him, against Birkin and Gudrun and that whole set.\nHe wanted to go back to the dullest conservatism, to the most stupid of\nconventional people. He wanted to revert to the strictest Toryism. But\nthe desire did not last long enough to carry him into action.\n\nDuring his childhood and his boyhood he had wanted a sort of savagedom.\nThe days of Homer were his ideal, when a man was chief of an army of\nheroes, or spent his years in wonderful Odyssey. He hated remorselessly\nthe circumstances of his own life, so much that he never really saw\nBeldover and the colliery valley. He turned his face entirely away from\nthe blackened mining region that stretched away on the right hand of\nShortlands, he turned entirely to the country and the woods beyond\nWilley Water. It was true that the panting and rattling of the coal\nmines could always be heard at Shortlands. But from his earliest\nchildhood, Gerald had paid no heed to this. He had ignored the whole of\nthe industrial sea which surged in coal-blackened tides against the\ngrounds of the house. The world was really a wilderness where one\nhunted and swam and rode. He rebelled against all authority. Life was a\ncondition of savage freedom.\n\nThen he had been sent away to school, which was so much death to him.\nHe refused to go to Oxford, choosing a German university. He had spent\na certain time at Bonn, at Berlin, and at Frankfurt. There, a curiosity\nhad been aroused in his mind. He wanted to see and to know, in a\ncurious objective fashion, as if it were an amusement to him. Then he\nmust try war. Then he must travel into the savage regions that had so\nattracted him.\n\nThe result was, he found humanity very much alike everywhere, and to a\nmind like his, curious and cold, the savage was duller, less exciting\nthan the European. So he took hold of all kinds of sociological ideas,\nand ideas of reform. But they never went more than skin-deep, they were\nnever more than a mental amusement. Their interest lay chiefly in the\nreaction against the positive order, the destructive reaction.\n\nHe discovered at last a real adventure in the coal-mines. His father\nasked him to help in the firm. Gerald had been educated in the science\nof mining, and it had never interested him. Now, suddenly, with a sort\nof exultation, he laid hold of the world.\n\nThere was impressed photographically on his consciousness the great\nindustry. Suddenly, it was real, he was part of it. Down the valley ran\nthe colliery railway, linking mine with mine. Down the railway ran the\ntrains, short trains of heavily laden trucks, long trains of empty\nwagons, each one bearing in big white letters the initials:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cC. B. & Co.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThese white letters on all the wagons he had seen since his first\nchildhood, and it was as if he had never seen them, they were so\nfamiliar, and so ignored. Now at last he saw his own name written on\nthe wall. Now he had a vision of power.\n\nSo many wagons, bearing his initial, running all over the country. He\nsaw them as he entered London in the train, he saw them at Dover. So\nfar his power ramified. He looked at Beldover, at Selby, at Whatmore,\nat Lethley Bank, the great colliery villages which depended entirely on\nhis mines. They were hideous and sordid, during his childhood they had\nbeen sores in his consciousness. And now he saw them with pride. Four\nraw new towns, and many ugly industrial hamlets were crowded under his\ndependence. He saw the stream of miners flowing along the causeways\nfrom the mines at the end of the afternoon, thousands of blackened,\nslightly distorted human beings with red mouths, all moving subjugate\nto his will. He pushed slowly in his motor-car through the little\nmarket-top on Friday nights in Beldover, through a solid mass of human\nbeings that were making their purchases and doing their weekly\nspending. They were all subordinate to him. They were ugly and uncouth,\nbut they were his instruments. He was the God of the machine. They made\nway for his motor-car automatically, slowly.\n\nHe did not care whether they made way with alacrity, or grudgingly. He\ndid not care what they thought of him. His vision had suddenly\ncrystallised. Suddenly he had conceived the pure instrumentality of\nmankind. There had been so much humanitarianism, so much talk of\nsufferings and feelings. It was ridiculous. The sufferings and feelings\nof individuals did not matter in the least. They were mere conditions,\nlike the weather. What mattered was the pure instrumentality of the\nindividual. As a man as of a knife: does it cut well? Nothing else\nmattered.\n\nEverything in the world has its function, and is good or not good in so\nfar as it fulfils this function more or less perfectly. Was a miner a\ngood miner? Then he was complete. Was a manager a good manager? That\nwas enough. Gerald himself, who was responsible for all this industry,\nwas he a good director? If he were, he had fulfilled his life. The rest\nwas by-play.\n\nThe mines were there, they were old. They were giving out, it did not\npay to work the seams. There was talk of closing down two of them. It\nwas at this point that Gerald arrived on the scene.\n\nHe looked around. There lay the mines. They were old, obsolete. They\nwere like old lions, no more good. He looked again. Pah! the mines were\nnothing but the clumsy efforts of impure minds. There they lay,\nabortions of a half-trained mind. Let the idea of them be swept away.\nHe cleared his brain of them, and thought only of the coal in the under\nearth. How much was there?\n\nThere was plenty of coal. The old workings could not get at it, that\nwas all. Then break the neck of the old workings. The coal lay there in\nits seams, even though the seams were thin. There it lay, inert matter,\nas it had always lain, since the beginning of time, subject to the will\nof man. The will of man was the determining factor. Man was the archgod\nof earth. His mind was obedient to serve his will. Man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s will was the\nabsolute, the only absolute.\n\nAnd it was his will to subjugate Matter to his own ends. The\nsubjugation itself was the point, the fight was the be-all, the fruits\nof victory were mere results. It was not for the sake of money that\nGerald took over the mines. He did not care about money, fundamentally.\nHe was neither ostentatious nor luxurious, neither did he care about\nsocial position, not finally. What he wanted was the pure fulfilment of\nhis own will in the struggle with the natural conditions. His will was\nnow, to take the coal out of the earth, profitably. The profit was\nmerely the condition of victory, but the victory itself lay in the feat\nachieved. He vibrated with zest before the challenge. Every day he was\nin the mines, examining, testing, he consulted experts, he gradually\ngathered the whole situation into his mind, as a general grasps the\nplan of his campaign.\n\nThen there was need for a complete break. The mines were run on an old\nsystem, an obsolete idea. The initial idea had been, to obtain as much\nmoney from the earth as would make the owners comfortably rich, would\nallow the workmen sufficient wages and good conditions, and would\nincrease the wealth of the country altogether. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s father,\nfollowing in the second generation, having a sufficient fortune, had\nthought only of the men. The mines, for him, were primarily great\nfields to produce bread and plenty for all the hundreds of human beings\ngathered about them. He had lived and striven with his fellow owners to\nbenefit the men every time. And the men had been benefited in their\nfashion. There were few poor, and few needy. All was plenty, because\nthe mines were good and easy to work. And the miners, in those days,\nfinding themselves richer than they might have expected, felt glad and\ntriumphant. They thought themselves well-off, they congratulated\nthemselves on their good-fortune, they remembered how their fathers had\nstarved and suffered, and they felt that better times had come. They\nwere grateful to those others, the pioneers, the new owners, who had\nopened out the pits, and let forth this stream of plenty.\n\nBut man is never satisfied, and so the miners, from gratitude to their\nowners, passed on to murmuring. Their sufficiency decreased with\nknowledge, they wanted more. Why should the master be so\nout-of-all-proportion rich?\n\nThere was a crisis when Gerald was a boy, when the Masters\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 Federation\nclosed down the mines because the men would not accept a reduction.\nThis lock-out had forced home the new conditions to Thomas Crich.\nBelonging to the Federation, he had been compelled by his honour to\nclose the pits against his men. He, the father, the Patriarch, was\nforced to deny the means of life to his sons, his people. He, the rich\nman who would hardly enter heaven because of his possessions, must now\nturn upon the poor, upon those who were nearer Christ than himself,\nthose who were humble and despised and closer to perfection, those who\nwere manly and noble in their labours, and must say to them: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYe shall\nneither labour nor eat bread.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was this recognition of the state of war which really broke his\nheart. He wanted his industry to be run on love. Oh, he wanted love to\nbe the directing power even of the mines. And now, from under the cloak\nof love, the sword was cynically drawn, the sword of mechanical\nnecessity.\n\nThis really broke his heart. He must have the illusion and now the\nillusion was destroyed. The men were not against _him_, but they were\nagainst the masters. It was war, and willy nilly he found himself on\nthe wrong side, in his own conscience. Seething masses of miners met\ndaily, carried away by a new religious impulse. The idea flew through\nthem: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll men are equal on earth,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d and they would carry the idea to\nits material fulfilment. After all, is it not the teaching of Christ?\nAnd what is an idea, if not the germ of action in the material world.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll men are equal in spirit, they are all sons of God. Whence then\nthis obvious _disquality_?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d It was a religious creed pushed to its\nmaterial conclusion. Thomas Crich at least had no answer. He could but\nadmit, according to his sincere tenets, that the disquality was wrong.\nBut he could not give up his goods, which were the stuff of disquality.\nSo the men would fight for their rights. The last impulses of the last\nreligious passion left on earth, the passion for equality, inspired\nthem.\n\nSeething mobs of men marched about, their faces lighted up as for holy\nwar, with a smoke of cupidity. How disentangle the passion for equality\nfrom the passion of cupidity, when begins the fight for equality of\npossessions? But the God was the machine. Each man claimed equality in\nthe Godhead of the great productive machine. Every man equally was part\nof this Godhead. But somehow, somewhere, Thomas Crich knew this was\nfalse. When the machine is the Godhead, and production or work is\nworship, then the most mechanical mind is purest and highest, the\nrepresentative of God on earth. And the rest are subordinate, each\naccording to his degree.\n\nRiots broke out, Whatmore pit-head was in flames. This was the pit\nfurthest in the country, near the woods. Soldiers came. From the\nwindows of Shortlands, on that fatal day, could be seen the flare of\nfire in the sky not far off, and now the little colliery train, with\nthe workmen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s carriages which were used to convey the miners to the\ndistant Whatmore, was crossing the valley full of soldiers, full of\nredcoats. Then there was the far-off sound of firing, then the later\nnews that the mob was dispersed, one man was shot dead, the fire was\nput out.\n\nGerald, who was a boy, was filled with the wildest excitement and\ndelight. He longed to go with the soldiers to shoot the men. But he was\nnot allowed to go out of the lodge gates. At the gates were stationed\nsentries with guns. Gerald stood near them in delight, whilst gangs of\nderisive miners strolled up and down the lanes, calling and jeering:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow then, three ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099porth o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 coppers, let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s see thee shoot thy gun.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nInsults were chalked on the walls and the fences, the servants left.\n\nAnd all this while Thomas Crich was breaking his heart, and giving away\nhundreds of pounds in charity. Everywhere there was free food, a\nsurfeit of free food. Anybody could have bread for asking, and a loaf\ncost only three-ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099pence. Every day there was a free tea somewhere, the\nchildren had never had so many treats in their lives. On Friday\nafternoon great basketfuls of buns and cakes were taken into the\nschools, and great pitchers of milk, the schoolchildren had what they\nwanted. They were sick with eating too much cake and milk.\n\nAnd then it came to an end, and the men went back to work. But it was\nnever the same as before. There was a new situation created, a new idea\nreigned. Even in the machine, there should be equality. No part should\nbe subordinate to any other part: all should be equal. The instinct for\nchaos had entered. Mystic equality lies in abstraction, not in having\nor in doing, which are processes. In function and process, one man, one\npart, must of necessity be subordinate to another. It is a condition of\nbeing. But the desire for chaos had risen, and the idea of mechanical\nequality was the weapon of disruption which should execute the will of\nman, the will for chaos.\n\nGerald was a boy at the time of the strike, but he longed to be a man,\nto fight the colliers. The father however was trapped between two\nhalf-truths, and broken. He wanted to be a pure Christian, one and\nequal with all men. He even wanted to give away all he had, to the\npoor. Yet he was a great promoter of industry, and he knew perfectly\nthat he must keep his goods and keep his authority. This was as divine\na necessity in him, as the need to give away all he possessed\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094more\ndivine, even, since this was the necessity he acted upon. Yet because\nhe did _not_ act on the other ideal, it dominated him, he was dying of\nchagrin because he must forfeit it. He wanted to be a father of loving\nkindness and sacrificial benevolence. The colliers shouted to him about\nhis thousands a year. They would not be deceived.\n\nWhen Gerald grew up in the ways of the world, he shifted the position.\nHe did not care about the equality. The whole Christian attitude of\nlove and self-sacrifice was old hat. He knew that position and\nauthority were the right thing in the world, and it was useless to cant\nabout it. They were the right thing, for the simple reason that they\nwere functionally necessary. They were not the be-all and the end-all.\nIt was like being part of a machine. He himself happened to be a\ncontrolling, central part, the masses of men were the parts variously\ncontrolled. This was merely as it happened. As well get excited because\na central hub drives a hundred outer wheels or because the whole\nuniverse wheels round the sun. After all, it would be mere silliness to\nsay that the moon and the earth and Saturn and Jupiter and Venus have\njust as much right to be the centre of the universe, each of them\nseparately, as the sun. Such an assertion is made merely in the desire\nof chaos.\n\nWithout bothering to _think_ to a conclusion, Gerald jumped to a\nconclusion. He abandoned the whole democratic-equality problem as a\nproblem of silliness. What mattered was the great social productive\nmachine. Let that work perfectly, let it produce a sufficiency of\neverything, let every man be given a rational portion, greater or less\naccording to his functional degree or magnitude, and then, provision\nmade, let the devil supervene, let every man look after his own\namusements and appetites, so long as he interfered with nobody.\n\nSo Gerald set himself to work, to put the great industry in order. In\nhis travels, and in his accompanying readings, he had come to the\nconclusion that the essential secret of life was harmony. He did not\ndefine to himself at all clearly what harmony was. The word pleased\nhim, he felt he had come to his own conclusions. And he proceeded to\nput his philosophy into practice by forcing order into the established\nworld, translating the mystic word harmony into the practical word\norganisation.\n\nImmediately he _saw_ the firm, he realised what he could do. He had a\nfight to fight with Matter, with the earth and the coal it enclosed.\nThis was the sole idea, to turn upon the inanimate matter of the\nunderground, and reduce it to his will. And for this fight with matter,\none must have perfect instruments in perfect organisation, a mechanism\nso subtle and harmonious in its workings that it represents the single\nmind of man, and by its relentless repetition of given movement, will\naccomplish a purpose irresistibly, inhumanly. It was this inhuman\nprinciple in the mechanism he wanted to construct that inspired Gerald\nwith an almost religious exaltation. He, the man, could interpose a\nperfect, changeless, godlike medium between himself and the Matter he\nhad to subjugate. There were two opposites, his will and the resistant\nMatter of the earth. And between these he could establish the very\nexpression of his will, the incarnation of his power, a great and\nperfect machine, a system, an activity of pure order, pure mechanical\nrepetition, repetition _ad infinitum_, hence eternal and infinite. He\nfound his eternal and his infinite in the pure machine-principle of\nperfect co-ordination into one pure, complex, infinitely repeated\nmotion, like the spinning of a wheel; but a productive spinning, as the\nrevolving of the universe may be called a productive spinning, a\nproductive repetition through eternity, to infinity. And this is the\nGod-motion, this productive repetition _ad infinitum_. And Gerald was\nthe God of the machine, _Deus ex Machina_. And the whole productive\nwill of man was the Godhead.\n\nHe had his life-work now, to extend over the earth a great and perfect\nsystem in which the will of man ran smooth and unthwarted, timeless, a\nGodhead in process. He had to begin with the mines. The terms were\ngiven: first the resistant Matter of the underground; then the\ninstruments of its subjugation, instruments human and metallic; and\nfinally his own pure will, his own mind. It would need a marvellous\nadjustment of myriad instruments, human, animal, metallic, kinetic,\ndynamic, a marvellous casting of myriad tiny wholes into one great\nperfect entirety. And then, in this case there was perfection attained,\nthe will of the highest was perfectly fulfilled, the will of mankind\nwas perfectly enacted; for was not mankind mystically\ncontra-distinguished against inanimate Matter, was not the history of\nmankind just the history of the conquest of the one by the other?\n\nThe miners were overreached. While they were still in the toils of\ndivine equality of man, Gerald had passed on, granted essentially their\ncase, and proceeded in his quality of human being to fulfil the will of\nmankind as a whole. He merely represented the miners in a higher sense\nwhen he perceived that the only way to fulfil perfectly the will of man\nwas to establish the perfect, inhuman machine. But he represented them\nvery essentially, they were far behind, out of date, squabbling for\ntheir material equality. The desire had already transmuted into this\nnew and greater desire, for a perfect intervening mechanism between man\nand Matter, the desire to translate the Godhead into pure mechanism.\n\nAs soon as Gerald entered the firm, the convulsion of death ran through\nthe old system. He had all his life been tortured by a furious and\ndestructive demon, which possessed him sometimes like an insanity. This\ntemper now entered like a virus into the firm, and there were cruel\neruptions. Terrible and inhuman were his examinations into every\ndetail; there was no privacy he would spare, no old sentiment but he\nwould turn it over. The old grey managers, the old grey clerks, the\ndoddering old pensioners, he looked at them, and removed them as so\nmuch lumber. The whole concern seemed like a hospital of invalid\nemployees. He had no emotional qualms. He arranged what pensions were\nnecessary, he looked for efficient substitutes, and when these were\nfound, he substituted them for the old hands.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve a pitiful letter here from Letherington,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d his father would say,\nin a tone of deprecation and appeal. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think the poor fellow\nmight keep on a little longer. I always fancied he did very well.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got a man in his place now, father. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be happier out of it,\nbelieve me. You think his allowance is plenty, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is not the allowance that he wants, poor man. He feels it very\nmuch, that he is superannuated. Says he thought he had twenty more\nyears of work in him yet.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot of this kind of work I want. He doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t understand.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe father sighed. He wanted not to know any more. He believed the pits\nwould have to be overhauled if they were to go on working. And after\nall, it would be worst in the long run for everybody, if they must\nclose down. So he could make no answer to the appeals of his old and\ntrusty servants, he could only repeat \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald says.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSo the father drew more and more out of the light. The whole frame of\nthe real life was broken for him. He had been right according to his\nlights. And his lights had been those of the great religion. Yet they\nseemed to have become obsolete, to be superseded in the world. He could\nnot understand. He only withdrew with his lights into an inner room,\ninto the silence. The beautiful candles of belief, that would not do to\nlight the world any more, they would still burn sweetly and\nsufficiently in the inner room of his soul, and in the silence of his\nretirement.\n\nGerald rushed into the reform of the firm, beginning with the office.\nIt was needful to economise severely, to make possible the great\nalterations he must introduce.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are these widows\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 coals?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe have always allowed all widows of men who worked for the firm a\nload of coals every three months.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey must pay cost price henceforward. The firm is not a charity\ninstitution, as everybody seems to think.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWidows, these stock figures of sentimental humanitarianism, he felt a\ndislike at the thought of them. They were almost repulsive. Why were\nthey not immolated on the pyre of the husband, like the sati in India?\nAt any rate, let them pay the cost of their coals.\n\nIn a thousand ways he cut down the expenditure, in ways so fine as to\nbe hardly noticeable to the men. The miners must pay for the cartage of\ntheir coals, heavy cartage too; they must pay for their tools, for the\nsharpening, for the care of lamps, for the many trifling things that\nmade the bill of charges against every man mount up to a shilling or so\nin the week. It was not grasped very definitely by the miners, though\nthey were sore enough. But it saved hundreds of pounds every week for\nthe firm.\n\nGradually Gerald got hold of everything. And then began the great\nreform. Expert engineers were introduced in every department. An\nenormous electric plant was installed, both for lighting and for\nhaulage underground, and for power. The electricity was carried into\nevery mine. New machinery was brought from America, such as the miners\nhad never seen before, great iron men, as the cutting machines were\ncalled, and unusual appliances. The working of the pits was thoroughly\nchanged, all the control was taken out of the hands of the miners, the\nbutty system was abolished. Everything was run on the most accurate and\ndelicate scientific method, educated and expert men were in control\neverywhere, the miners were reduced to mere mechanical instruments.\nThey had to work hard, much harder than before, the work was terrible\nand heart-breaking in its mechanicalness.\n\nBut they submitted to it all. The joy went out of their lives, the hope\nseemed to perish as they became more and more mechanised. And yet they\naccepted the new conditions. They even got a further satisfaction out\nof them. At first they hated Gerald Crich, they swore to do something\nto him, to murder him. But as time went on, they accepted everything\nwith some fatal satisfaction. Gerald was their high priest, he\nrepresented the religion they really felt. His father was forgotten\nalready. There was a new world, a new order, strict, terrible, inhuman,\nbut satisfying in its very destructiveness. The men were satisfied to\nbelong to the great and wonderful machine, even whilst it destroyed\nthem. It was what they wanted. It was the highest that man had\nproduced, the most wonderful and superhuman. They were exalted by\nbelonging to this great and superhuman system which was beyond feeling\nor reason, something really godlike. Their hearts died within them, but\ntheir souls were satisfied. It was what they wanted. Otherwise Gerald\ncould never have done what he did. He was just ahead of them in giving\nthem what they wanted, this participation in a great and perfect system\nthat subjected life to pure mathematical principles. This was a sort of\nfreedom, the sort they really wanted. It was the first great step in\nundoing, the first great phase of chaos, the substitution of the\nmechanical principle for the organic, the destruction of the organic\npurpose, the organic unity, and the subordination of every organic unit\nto the great mechanical purpose. It was pure organic disintegration and\npure mechanical organisation. This is the first and finest state of\nchaos.\n\nGerald was satisfied. He knew the colliers said they hated him. But he\nhad long ceased to hate them. When they streamed past him at evening,\ntheir heavy boots slurring on the pavement wearily, their shoulders\nslightly distorted, they took no notice of him, they gave him no\ngreeting whatever, they passed in a grey-black stream of unemotional\nacceptance. They were not important to him, save as instruments, nor he\nto them, save as a supreme instrument of control. As miners they had\ntheir being, he had his being as director. He admired their qualities.\nBut as men, personalities, they were just accidents, sporadic little\nunimportant phenomena. And tacitly, the men agreed to this. For Gerald\nagreed to it in himself.\n\nHe had succeeded. He had converted the industry into a new and terrible\npurity. There was a greater output of coal than ever, the wonderful and\ndelicate system ran almost perfectly. He had a set of really clever\nengineers, both mining and electrical, and they did not cost much. A\nhighly educated man cost very little more than a workman. His managers,\nwho were all rare men, were no more expensive than the old bungling\nfools of his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s days, who were merely colliers promoted. His\nchief manager, who had twelve hundred a year, saved the firm at least\nfive thousand. The whole system was now so perfect that Gerald was\nhardly necessary any more.\n\nIt was so perfect that sometimes a strange fear came over him, and he\ndid not know what to do. He went on for some years in a sort of trance\nof activity. What he was doing seemed supreme, he was almost like a\ndivinity. He was a pure and exalted activity.\n\nBut now he had succeeded\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he had finally succeeded. And once or twice\nlately, when he was alone in the evening and had nothing to do, he had\nsuddenly stood up in terror, not knowing what he was. And he went to\nthe mirror and looked long and closely at his own face, at his own\neyes, seeking for something. He was afraid, in mortal dry fear, but he\nknew not what of. He looked at his own face. There it was, shapely and\nhealthy and the same as ever, yet somehow, it was not real, it was a\nmask. He dared not touch it, for fear it should prove to be only a\ncomposition mask. His eyes were blue and keen as ever, and as firm in\ntheir sockets. Yet he was not sure that they were not blue false\nbubbles that would burst in a moment and leave clear annihilation. He\ncould see the darkness in them, as if they were only bubbles of\ndarkness. He was afraid that one day he would break down and be a\npurely meaningless babble lapping round a darkness.\n\nBut his will yet held good, he was able to go away and read, and think\nabout things. He liked to read books about the primitive man, books of\nanthropology, and also works of speculative philosophy. His mind was\nvery active. But it was like a bubble floating in the darkness. At any\nmoment it might burst and leave him in chaos. He would not die. He knew\nthat. He would go on living, but the meaning would have collapsed out\nof him, his divine reason would be gone. In a strangely indifferent,\nsterile way, he was frightened. But he could not react even to the\nfear. It was as if his centres of feeling were drying up. He remained\ncalm, calculative and healthy, and quite freely deliberate, even whilst\nhe felt, with faint, small but final sterile horror, that his mystic\nreason was breaking, giving way now, at this crisis.\n\nAnd it was a strain. He knew there was no equilibrium. He would have to\ngo in some direction, shortly, to find relief. Only Birkin kept the\nfear definitely off him, saved him his quick sufficiency in life, by\nthe odd mobility and changeableness which seemed to contain the\nquintessence of faith. But then Gerald must always come away from\nBirkin, as from a Church service, back to the outside real world of\nwork and life. There it was, it did not alter, and words were\nfutilities. He had to keep himself in reckoning with the world of work\nand material life. And it became more and more difficult, such a\nstrange pressure was upon him, as if the very middle of him were a\nvacuum, and outside were an awful tension.\n\nHe had found his most satisfactory relief in women. After a debauch\nwith some desperate woman, he went on quite easy and forgetful. The\ndevil of it was, it was so hard to keep up his interest in women\nnowadays. He didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care about them any more. A Pussum was all right in\nher way, but she was an exceptional case, and even she mattered\nextremely little. No, women, in that sense, were useless to him any\nmore. He felt that his _mind_ needed acute stimulation, before he could\nbe physically roused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\n RABBIT\n\nGudrun knew that it was a critical thing for her to go to Shortlands.\nShe knew it was equivalent to accepting Gerald Crich as a lover. And\nthough she hung back, disliking the condition, yet she knew she would\ngo on. She equivocated. She said to herself, in torment recalling the\nblow and the kiss, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cafter all, what is it? What is a kiss? What even is\na blow? It is an instant, vanished at once. I can go to Shortlands just\nfor a time, before I go away, if only to see what it is like.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d For she\nhad an insatiable curiosity to see and to know everything.\n\nShe also wanted to know what Winifred was really like. Having heard the\nchild calling from the steamer in the night, she felt some mysterious\nconnection with her.\n\nGudrun talked with the father in the library. Then he sent for his\ndaughter. She came accompanied by Mademoiselle.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWinnie, this is Miss Brangwen, who will be so kind as to help you with\nyour drawing and making models of your animals,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the father.\n\nThe child looked at Gudrun for a moment with interest, before she came\nforward and with face averted offered her hand. There was a complete\n_sang-froid_ and indifference under Winifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s childish reserve, a\ncertain irresponsible callousness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the child, not lifting her face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you do?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nThen Winifred stood aside, and Gudrun was introduced to Mademoiselle.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou have a fine day for your walk,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Mademoiselle, in a bright\nmanner.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Quite_ fine,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nWinifred was watching from her distance. She was as if amused, but\nrather unsure as yet what this new person was like. She saw so many new\npersons, and so few who became real to her. Mademoiselle was of no\ncount whatever, the child merely put up with her, calmly and easily,\naccepting her little authority with faint scorn, compliant out of\nchildish arrogance of indifference.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, Winifred,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the father, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009caren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you glad Miss Brangwen has\ncome? She makes animals and birds in wood and in clay, that the people\nin London write about in the papers, praising them to the skies.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWinifred smiled slightly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho told you, Daddie?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho told me? Hermione told me, and Rupert Birkin.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you know them?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Winifred asked of Gudrun, turning to her with faint\nchallenge.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nWinifred readjusted herself a little. She had been ready to accept\nGudrun as a sort of servant. Now she saw it was on terms of friendship\nthey were intended to meet. She was rather glad. She had so many half\ninferiors, whom she tolerated with perfect good-humour.\n\nGudrun was very calm. She also did not take these things very\nseriously. A new occasion was mostly spectacular to her. However,\nWinifred was a detached, ironic child, she would never attach herself.\nGudrun liked her and was intrigued by her. The first meetings went off\nwith a certain humiliating clumsiness. Neither Winifred nor her\ninstructress had any social grace.\n\nSoon, however, they met in a kind of make-belief world. Winifred did\nnot notice human beings unless they were like herself, playful and\nslightly mocking. She would accept nothing but the world of amusement,\nand the serious people of her life were the animals she had for pets.\nOn those she lavished, almost ironically, her affection and her\ncompanionship. To the rest of the human scheme she submitted with a\nfaint bored indifference.\n\nShe had a pekinese dog called Looloo, which she loved.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet us draw Looloo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand see if we can get his\nLooliness, shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDarling!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Winifred, rushing to the dog, that sat with\ncontemplative sadness on the hearth, and kissing its bulging brow.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDarling one, will you be drawn? Shall its mummy draw its portrait?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nThen she chuckled gleefully, and turning to Gudrun, said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh let\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey proceeded to get pencils and paper, and were ready.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBeautifullest,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Winifred, hugging the dog, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009csit still while its\nmummy draws its beautiful portrait.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The dog looked up at her with\ngrievous resignation in its large, prominent eyes. She kissed it\nfervently, and said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wonder what mine will be like. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sure to be\nawful.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAs she sketched she chuckled to herself, and cried out at times:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh darling, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re so beautiful!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd again chuckling, she rushed to embrace the dog, in penitence, as if\nshe were doing him some subtle injury. He sat all the time with the\nresignation and fretfulness of ages on his dark velvety face. She drew\nslowly, with a wicked concentration in her eyes, her head on one side,\nan intense stillness over her. She was as if working the spell of some\nenchantment. Suddenly she had finished. She looked at the dog, and then\nat her drawing, and then cried, with real grief for the dog, and at the\nsame time with a wicked exultation:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy beautiful, why did they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe took her paper to the dog, and held it under his nose. He turned\nhis head aside as in chagrin and mortification, and she impulsively\nkissed his velvety bulging forehead.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a Loolie, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a little Loozie! Look at his portrait, darling, look\nat his portrait, that his mother has done of him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She looked at her\npaper and chuckled. Then, kissing the dog once more, she rose and came\ngravely to Gudrun, offering her the paper.\n\nIt was a grotesque little diagram of a grotesque little animal, so\nwicked and so comical, a slow smile came over Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face,\nunconsciously. And at her side Winifred chuckled with glee, and said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like him, is it?

He looked up at her with reproachful,\nsaturnine eyes, vanquished in his extreme agedness of being. Then she\nflew back to her drawing, and chuckled with satisfaction.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like him, is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s very like him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun replied.\n\nThe child treasured her drawing, carried it about with her, and showed\nit, with a silent embarrassment, to everybody.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, thrusting the paper into her father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Looloo!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he exclaimed. And he looked down in surprise,\nhearing the almost inhuman chuckle of the child at his side.\n\nGerald was away from home when Gudrun first came to Shortlands. But the\nfirst morning he came back he watched for her. It was a sunny, soft\nmorning, and he lingered in the garden paths, looking at the flowers\nthat had come out during his absence. He was clean and fit as ever,\nshaven, his fair hair scrupulously parted at the side, bright in the\nsunshine, his short, fair moustache closely clipped, his eyes with\ntheir humorous kind twinkle, which was so deceptive. He was dressed in\nblack, his clothes sat well on his well-nourished body. Yet as he\nlingered before the flower-beds in the morning sunshine, there was a\ncertain isolation, a fear about him, as of something wanting.\n\nGudrun came up quickly, unseen. She was dressed in blue, with woollen\nyellow stockings, like the Bluecoat boys. He glanced up in surprise.\nHer stockings always disconcerted him, the pale-yellow stockings and\nthe heavy heavy black shoes. Winifred, who had been playing about the\ngarden with Mademoiselle and the dogs, came flitting towards Gudrun.\nThe child wore a dress of black-and-white stripes. Her hair was rather\nshort, cut round and hanging level in her neck.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re going to do Bismarck, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, linking her hand\nthrough Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s arm.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re going to do Bismarck.

Strange\nhow her reverential, almost ecstatic admiration of the flowers caressed\nhis nerves. She stooped down, and touched the trumpets, with infinitely\nfine and delicate-touching finger-tips. It filled him with ease to see\nher. When she rose, her eyes, hot with the beauty of the flowers,\nlooked into his.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSort of petunia, I suppose,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really know them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey are quite strangers to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nThey stood together in a false intimacy, a nervous contact. And he was\nin love with her.\n\nShe was aware of Mademoiselle standing near, like a little French\nbeetle, observant and calculating. She moved away with Winifred, saying\nthey would go to find Bismarck.\n\nGerald watched them go, looking all the while at the soft, full, still\nbody of Gudrun, in its silky cashmere. How silky and rich and soft her\nbody must be. An excess of appreciation came over his mind, she was the\nall-desirable, the all-beautiful. He wanted only to come to her,\nnothing more. He was only this, this being that should come to her, and\nbe given to her.\n\nAt the same time he was finely and acutely aware of Mademoiselle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nneat, brittle finality of form. She was like some elegant beetle with\nthin ankles, perched on her high heels, her glossy black dress\nperfectly correct, her dark hair done high and admirably. How repulsive\nher completeness and her finality was! He loathed her.\n\nYet he did admire her. She was perfectly correct. And it did rather\nannoy him, that Gudrun came dressed in startling colours, like a macaw,\nwhen the family was in mourning. Like a macaw she was! He watched the\nlingering way she took her feet from the ground. And her ankles were\npale yellow, and her dress a deep blue. Yet it pleased him. It pleased\nhim very much. He felt the challenge in her very attire\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she challenged\nthe whole world. And he smiled as to the note of a trumpet.\n\nGudrun and Winifred went through the house to the back, where were the\nstables and the out-buildings. Everywhere was still and deserted. Mr\nCrich had gone out for a short drive, the stableman had just led round\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s horse.

Winifred made a strange crooning noise of unaccountable\nexcitement. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s still!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, seeing the rabbit settled down\nin a far corner of the hutch. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we take him now?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered\nexcitedly, mysteriously, looking up at Gudrun and edging very close.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we get him now?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she chuckled wickedly to herself.\n\nThey unlocked the door of the hutch. Gudrun thrust in her arm and\nseized the great, lusty rabbit as it crouched still, she grasped its\nlong ears. It set its four feet flat, and thrust back. There was a long\nscraping sound as it was hauled forward, and in another instant it was\nin mid-air, lunging wildly, its body flying like a spring coiled and\nreleased, as it lashed out, suspended from the ears. Gudrun held the\nblack-and-white tempest at arms\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 length, averting her face. But the\nrabbit was magically strong, it was all she could do to keep her grasp.\nShe almost lost her presence of mind.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBismarck, Bismarck, you are behaving terribly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Winifred in a\nrather frightened voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, do put him down, he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s beastly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun stood for a moment astounded by the thunder-storm that had\nsprung into being in her grip. Then her colour came up, a heavy rage\ncame over her like a cloud. She stood shaken as a house in a storm, and\nutterly overcome. Her heart was arrested with fury at the mindlessness\nand the bestial stupidity of this struggle, her wrists were badly\nscored by the claws of the beast, a heavy cruelty welled up in her.\n\nGerald came round as she was trying to capture the flying rabbit under\nher arm. He saw, with subtle recognition, her sullen passion of\ncruelty.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou should let one of the men do that for you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said hurrying up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s _so_ horrid!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Winifred, almost frantic.\n\nHe held out his nervous, sinewy hand and took the rabbit by the ears,\nfrom Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s most _fearfully_ strong,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, in a high voice, like the\ncrying a seagull, strange and vindictive.\n\nThe rabbit made itself into a ball in the air, and lashed out, flinging\nitself into a bow. It really seemed demoniacal. Gudrun saw Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nbody tighten, saw a sharp blindness come into his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know these beggars of old,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nThe long, demon-like beast lashed out again, spread on the air as if it\nwere flying, looking something like a dragon, then closing up again,\ninconceivably powerful and explosive. The man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s body, strung to its\nefforts, vibrated strongly. Then a sudden sharp, white-edged wrath came\nup in him. Swift as lightning he drew back and brought his free hand\ndown like a hawk on the neck of the rabbit. Simultaneously, there came\nthe unearthly abhorrent scream of a rabbit in the fear of death. It\nmade one immense writhe, tore his wrists and his sleeves in a final\nconvulsion, all its belly flashed white in a whirlwind of paws, and\nthen he had slung it round and had it under his arm, fast. It cowered\nand skulked. His face was gleaming with a smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think there was all that force in a rabbit,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said,\nlooking at Gudrun. And he saw her eyes black as night in her pallid\nface, she looked almost unearthly. The scream of the rabbit, after the\nviolent tussle, seemed to have torn the veil of her consciousness. He\nlooked at her, and the whitish, electric gleam in his face intensified.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really like him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Winifred was crooning. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care for him\nas I do for Loozie. He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hateful really.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA smile twisted Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, as she recovered. She knew she was\nrevealed. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they make the most fearful noise when they scream?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe cried, the high note in her voice, like a seagull\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cry.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAbominable,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe shouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be so silly when he has to be taken out,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Winifred was\nsaying, putting out her hand and touching the rabbit tentatively, as it\nskulked under his arm, motionless as if it were dead.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not dead, is he Gerald?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, he ought to be,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, he ought!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the child, with a sudden flush of amusement. And\nshe touched the rabbit with more confidence. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHis heart is beating _so_\nfast. Isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he funny? He really is.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere do you want him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn the little green court,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nGudrun looked at Gerald with strange, darkened eyes, strained with\nunderworld knowledge, almost supplicating, like those of a creature\nwhich is at his mercy, yet which is his ultimate victor. He did not\nknow what to say to her. He felt the mutual hellish recognition. And he\nfelt he ought to say something, to cover it. He had the power of\nlightning in his nerves, she seemed like a soft recipient of his\nmagical, hideous white fire. He was unconfident, he had qualms of fear.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid he hurt you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s an insensible beast,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, turning his face away.\n\nThey came to the little court, which was shut in by old red walls in\nwhose crevices wall-flowers were growing. The grass was soft and fine\nand old, a level floor carpeting the court, the sky was blue overhead.\nGerald tossed the rabbit down. It crouched still and would not move.\nGudrun watched it with faint horror.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it move?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s skulking,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe looked up at him, and a slight sinister smile contracted her white\nface.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it a _fool!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it a sickening _fool?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The\nvindictive mockery in her voice made his brain quiver. Glancing up at\nhim, into his eyes, she revealed again the mocking, white-cruel\nrecognition. There was a league between them, abhorrent to them both.\nThey were implicated with each other in abhorrent mysteries.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow many scratches have you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, showing his hard forearm,\nwhite and hard and torn in red gashes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow really vile!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, flushing with a sinister vision. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMine is\nnothing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe lifted her arm and showed a deep red score down the silken white\nflesh.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat a devil!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he exclaimed. But it was as if he had had knowledge of\nher in the long red rent of her forearm, so silken and soft. He did not\nwant to touch her. He would have to make himself touch her,\ndeliberately. The long, shallow red rip seemed torn across his own\nbrain, tearing the surface of his ultimate consciousness, letting\nthrough the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond,\nthe obscene beyond.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurt you very much, does it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, solicitous.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot at all,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried.\n\nAnd suddenly the rabbit, which had been crouching as if it were a\nflower, so still and soft, suddenly burst into life. Round and round\nthe court it went, as if shot from a gun, round and round like a furry\nmeteorite, in a tense hard circle that seemed to bind their brains.\nThey all stood in amazement, smiling uncannily, as if the rabbit were\nobeying some unknown incantation. Round and round it flew, on the grass\nunder the old red walls like a storm.\n\nAnd then quite suddenly it settled down, hobbled among the grass, and\nsat considering, its nose twitching like a bit of fluff in the wind.\nAfter having considered for a few minutes, a soft bunch with a black,\nopen eye, which perhaps was looking at them, perhaps was not, it\nhobbled calmly forward and began to nibble the grass with that mean\nmotion of a rabbit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s quick eating.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s mad,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is most decidedly mad.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe question is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat is madness?

She looked at\nhim and saw him, and knew that he was initiate as she was initiate.\nThis thwarted her, and contravened her, for the moment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod be praised we aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t rabbits,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in a high, shrill voice.\n\nThe smile intensified a little, on his face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot rabbits?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, looking at her fixedly.\n\nSlowly her face relaxed into a smile of obscene recognition.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh Gerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in a strong, slow, almost man-like way. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094All\nthat, and more.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Her eyes looked up at him with shocking nonchalance.\n\nHe felt again as if she had torn him across the breast, dully, finally.\nHe turned aside.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cEat, eat my darling!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Winifred was softly conjuring the rabbit, and\ncreeping forward to touch it.

He did\nnot write, nobody heard anything of him. Ursula, left alone, felt as if\neverything were lapsing out. There seemed to be no hope in the world.\nOne was a tiny little rock with the tide of nothingness rising higher\nand higher She herself was real, and only herself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094just like a rock in a\nwash of flood-water. The rest was all nothingness. She was hard and\nindifferent, isolated in herself.\n\nThere was nothing for it now, but contemptuous, resistant indifference.\nAll the world was lapsing into a grey wish-wash of nothingness, she had\nno contact and no connection anywhere. She despised and detested the\nwhole show. From the bottom of her heart, from the bottom of her soul,\nshe despised and detested people, adult people. She loved only children\nand animals: children she loved passionately, but coldly. They made her\nwant to hug them, to protect them, to give them life. But this very\nlove, based on pity and despair, was only a bondage and a pain to her.\nShe loved best of all the animals, that were single and unsocial as she\nherself was. She loved the horses and cows in the field. Each was\nsingle and to itself, magical. It was not referred away to some\ndetestable social principle. It was incapable of soulfulness and\ntragedy, which she detested so profoundly.\n\nShe could be very pleasant and flattering, almost subservient, to\npeople she met. But no one was taken in. Instinctively each felt her\ncontemptuous mockery of the human being in himself, or herself. She had\na profound grudge against the human being. That which the word \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chuman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nstood for was despicable and repugnant to her.\n\nMostly her heart was closed in this hidden, unconscious strain of\ncontemptuous ridicule. She thought she loved, she thought she was full\nof love. This was her idea of herself. But the strange brightness of\nher presence, a marvellous radiance of intrinsic vitality, was a\nluminousness of supreme repudiation, nothing but repudiation.\n\nYet, at moments, she yielded and softened, she wanted pure love, only\npure love. This other, this state of constant unfailing repudiation,\nwas a strain, a suffering also. A terrible desire for pure love\novercame her again.\n\nShe went out one evening, numbed by this constant essential suffering.\nThose who are timed for destruction must die now. The knowledge of this\nreached a finality, a finishing in her. And the finality released her.\nIf fate would carry off in death or downfall all those who were timed\nto go, why need she trouble, why repudiate any further. She was free of\nit all, she could seek a new union elsewhere.\n\nUrsula set off to Willey Green, towards the mill. She came to Willey\nWater. It was almost full again, after its period of emptiness. Then\nshe turned off through the woods. The night had fallen, it was dark.\nBut she forgot to be afraid, she who had such great sources of fear.\nAmong the trees, far from any human beings, there was a sort of magic\npeace. The more one could find a pure loneliness, with no taint of\npeople, the better one felt. She was in reality terrified, horrified in\nher apprehension of people.\n\nShe started, noticing something on her right hand, between the tree\ntrunks. It was like a great presence, watching her, dodging her. She\nstarted violently. It was only the moon, risen through the thin trees.\nBut it seemed so mysterious, with its white and deathly smile. And\nthere was no avoiding it. Night or day, one could not escape the\nsinister face, triumphant and radiant like this moon, with a high\nsmile. She hurried on, cowering from the white planet. She would just\nsee the pond at the mill before she went home.\n\nNot wanting to go through the yard, because of the dogs, she turned off\nalong the hill-side to descend on the pond from above. The moon was\ntranscendent over the bare, open space, she suffered from being exposed\nto it. There was a glimmer of nightly rabbits across the ground. The\nnight was as clear as crystal, and very still. She could hear a distant\ncoughing of a sheep.\n\nSo she swerved down to the steep, tree-hidden bank above the pond,\nwhere the alders twisted their roots. She was glad to pass into the\nshade out of the moon. There she stood, at the top of the fallen-away\nbank, her hand on the rough trunk of a tree, looking at the water, that\nwas perfect in its stillness, floating the moon upon it. But for some\nreason she disliked it. It did not give her anything. She listened for\nthe hoarse rustle of the sluice. And she wished for something else out\nof the night, she wanted another night, not this moon-brilliant\nhardness. She could feel her soul crying out in her, lamenting\ndesolately.\n\nShe saw a shadow moving by the water. It would be Birkin. He had come\nback then, unawares. She accepted it without remark, nothing mattered\nto her. She sat down among the roots of the alder tree, dim and veiled,\nhearing the sound of the sluice like dew distilling audibly into the\nnight. The islands were dark and half revealed, the reeds were dark\nalso, only some of them had a little frail fire of reflection. A fish\nleaped secretly, revealing the light in the pond. This fire of the\nchill night breaking constantly on to the pure darkness, repelled her.\nShe wished it were perfectly dark, perfectly, and noiseless and without\nmotion. Birkin, small and dark also, his hair tinged with moonlight,\nwandered nearer. He was quite near, and yet he did not exist in her. He\ndid not know she was there. Supposing he did something he would not\nwish to be seen doing, thinking he was quite private? But there, what\ndid it matter? What did the small privacies matter? How could it\nmatter, what he did? How can there be any secrets, we are all the same\norganisms? How can there be any secrecy, when everything is known to\nall of us?\n\nHe was touching unconsciously the dead husks of flowers as he passed\nby, and talking disconnectedly to himself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go away,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he was saying. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere _is_ no away. You only\nwithdraw upon yourself.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe threw a dead flower-husk on to the water.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAn antiphony\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they lie, and you sing back to them. There wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t have\nto be any truth, if there weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t any lies. Then one needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t assert\nanything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe stood still, looking at the water, and throwing upon it the husks of\nthe flowers.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCybele\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094curse her! The accursed Syria Dea! Does one begrudge it her?\nWhat else is there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula wanted to laugh loudly and hysterically, hearing his isolated\nvoice speaking out. It was so ridiculous.\n\nHe stood staring at the water. Then he stooped and picked up a stone,\nwhich he threw sharply at the pond. Ursula was aware of the bright moon\nleaping and swaying, all distorted, in her eyes. It seemed to shoot out\narms of fire like a cuttle-fish, like a luminous polyp, palpitating\nstrongly before her.\n\nAnd his shadow on the border of the pond, was watching for a few\nmoments, then he stooped and groped on the ground. Then again there was\na burst of sound, and a burst of brilliant light, the moon had exploded\non the water, and was flying asunder in flakes of white and dangerous\nfire. Rapidly, like white birds, the fires all broken rose across the\npond, fleeing in clamorous confusion, battling with the flock of dark\nwaves that were forcing their way in. The furthest waves of light,\nfleeing out, seemed to be clamouring against the shore for escape, the\nwaves of darkness came in heavily, running under towards the centre.\nBut at the centre, the heart of all, was still a vivid, incandescent\nquivering of a white moon not quite destroyed, a white body of fire\nwrithing and striving and not even now broken open, not yet violated.\nIt seemed to be drawing itself together with strange, violent pangs, in\nblind effort. It was getting stronger, it was re-asserting itself, the\ninviolable moon. And the rays were hastening in in thin lines of light,\nto return to the strengthened moon, that shook upon the water in\ntriumphant reassumption.\n\nBirkin stood and watched, motionless, till the pond was almost calm,\nthe moon was almost serene. Then, satisfied of so much, he looked for\nmore stones. She felt his invisible tenacity. And in a moment again,\nthe broken lights scattered in explosion over her face, dazzling her;\nand then, almost immediately, came the second shot. The moon leapt up\nwhite and burst through the air. Darts of bright light shot asunder,\ndarkness swept over the centre. There was no moon, only a battlefield\nof broken lights and shadows, running close together. Shadows, dark and\nheavy, struck again and again across the place where the heart of the\nmoon had been, obliterating it altogether. The white fragments pulsed\nup and down, and could not find where to go, apart and brilliant on the\nwater like the petals of a rose that a wind has blown far and wide.\n\nYet again, they were flickering their way to the centre, finding the\npath blindly, enviously. And again, all was still, as Birkin and Ursula\nwatched. The waters were loud on the shore. He saw the moon regathering\nitself insidiously, saw the heart of the rose intertwining vigorously\nand blindly, calling back the scattered fragments, winning home the\nfragments, in a pulse and in effort of return.\n\nAnd he was not satisfied. Like a madness, he must go on. He got large\nstones, and threw them, one after the other, at the white-burning\ncentre of the moon, till there was nothing but a rocking of hollow\nnoise, and a pond surged up, no moon any more, only a few broken flakes\ntangled and glittering broadcast in the darkness, without aim or\nmeaning, a darkened confusion, like a black and white kaleidoscope\ntossed at random. The hollow night was rocking and crashing with noise,\nand from the sluice came sharp, regular flashes of sound. Flakes of\nlight appeared here and there, glittering tormented among the shadows,\nfar off, in strange places; among the dripping shadow of the willow on\nthe island. Birkin stood and listened and was satisfied.\n\nUrsula was dazed, her mind was all gone. She felt she had fallen to the\nground and was spilled out, like water on the earth. Motionless and\nspent she remained in the gloom. Though even now she was aware,\nunseeing, that in the darkness was a little tumult of ebbing flakes of\nlight, a cluster dancing secretly in a round, twining and coming\nsteadily together. They were gathering a heart again, they were coming\nonce more into being. Gradually the fragments caught together\nre-united, heaving, rocking, dancing, falling back as in panic, but\nworking their way home again persistently, making semblance of fleeing\naway when they had advanced, but always flickering nearer, a little\ncloser to the mark, the cluster growing mysteriously larger and\nbrighter, as gleam after gleam fell in with the whole, until a ragged\nrose, a distorted, frayed moon was shaking upon the waters again,\nre-asserted, renewed, trying to recover from its convulsion, to get\nover the disfigurement and the agitation, to be whole and composed, at\npeace.\n\nBirkin lingered vaguely by the water. Ursula was afraid that he would\nstone the moon again. She slipped from her seat and went down to him,\nsaying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t throw stones at it any more, will you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow long have you been there?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll the time. You won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t throw any more stones, will you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wanted to see if I could make it be quite gone off the pond,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\nsaid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it was horrible, really. Why should you hate the moon? It hasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ndone you any harm, has it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it hate?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nAnd they were silent for a few minutes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhen did you come back?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cToday.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy did you never write?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI could find nothing to say.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy was there nothing to say?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know.

Ursula looked at the moon. It had\ngathered itself together, and was quivering slightly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it good for you, to be alone?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps. Not that I know much. But I got over a good deal. Did you do\nanything important?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo. I looked at England, and thought I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d done with it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy England?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked in surprise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know, it came like that.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a question of nations,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFrance is far worse.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I know. I felt I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d done with it all.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey went and sat down on the roots of the trees, in the shadow. And\nbeing silent, he remembered the beauty of her eyes, which were\nsometimes filled with light, like spring, suffused with wonderful\npromise. So he said to her, slowly, with difficulty:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is a golden light in you, which I wish you would give me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d It\nwas as if he had been thinking of this for some time.\n\nShe was startled, she seemed to leap clear of him. Yet also she was\npleased.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat kind of a light,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nBut he was shy, and did not say any more. So the moment passed for this\ntime. And gradually a feeling of sorrow came over her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy life is unfulfilled,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered briefly, not wanting to hear this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd I feel as if nobody could ever really love me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nBut he did not answer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said slowly, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat I only want physical\nthings?

I know you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want physical things by themselves.\nBut, I want you to give me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094to give your spirit to me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that golden light\nwhich is you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094which you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094give it me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAfter a moment\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s silence she replied:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how can I, you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love me! You only want your own ends. You\ndon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to serve _me_, and yet you want me to serve you. It is so\none-sided!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was a great effort to him to maintain this conversation, and to\npress for the thing he wanted from her, the surrender of her spirit.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is different,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe two kinds of service are so different.\nI serve you in another way\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not through _yourself_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094somewhere else. But I\nwant us to be together without bothering about ourselves\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094to be really\ntogether because we _are_ together, as if it were a phenomenon, not a\nnot a thing we have to maintain by our own effort.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, pondering. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are just egocentric. You never have any\nenthusiasm, you never come out with any spark towards me. You want\nyourself, really, and your own affairs. And you want me just to be\nthere, to serve you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut this only made him shut off from her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh well,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwords make no matter, any way.

And he wanted her to be with him there, in this world\nof proud indifference. But what was the good of telling her he wanted\nthis company in proud indifference. What was the good of talking, any\nway? It must happen beyond the sound of words. It was merely ruinous to\ntry to work her by conviction. This was a paradisal bird that could\nnever be netted, it must fly by itself to the heart.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI always think I am going to be loved\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and then I am let down.

He held her close, and kissed her softly,\ngently. It was such peace and heavenly freedom, just to fold her and\nkiss her gently, and not to have any thoughts or any desires or any\nwill, just to be still with her, to be perfectly still and together, in\na peace that was not sleep, but content in bliss. To be content in\nbliss, without desire or insistence anywhere, this was heaven: to be\ntogether in happy stillness.\n\nFor a long time she nestled to him, and he kissed her softly, her hair,\nher face, her ears, gently, softly, like dew falling. But this warm\nbreath on her ears disturbed her again, kindled the old destructive\nfires. She cleaved to him, and he could feel his blood changing like\nquicksilver.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be still, shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, as if submissively.\n\nAnd she continued to nestle against him.\n\nBut in a little while she drew away and looked at him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI must be going home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMust you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094how sad,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nShe leaned forward and put up her mouth to be kissed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you really sad?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she murmured, smiling.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wish we could stay as we were, always.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAlways! Do you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she murmured, as he kissed her. And then, out of a\nfull throat, she crooned \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cKiss me! Kiss me!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And she cleaved close to\nhim. He kissed her many times. But he too had his idea and his will. He\nwanted only gentle communion, no other, no passion now. So that soon\nshe drew away, put on her hat and went home.\n\nThe next day however, he felt wistful and yearning. He thought he had\nbeen wrong, perhaps. Perhaps he had been wrong to go to her with an\nidea of what he wanted. Was it really only an idea, or was it the\ninterpretation of a profound yearning? If the latter, how was it he was\nalways talking about sensual fulfilment? The two did not agree very\nwell.\n\nSuddenly he found himself face to face with a situation. It was as\nsimple as this: fatally simple. On the one hand, he knew he did not\nwant a further sensual experience\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094something deeper, darker, than\nordinary life could give. He remembered the African fetishes he had\nseen at Halliday\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s so often. There came back to him one, a statuette\nabout two feet high, a tall, slim, elegant figure from West Africa, in\ndark wood, glossy and suave. It was a woman, with hair dressed high,\nlike a melon-shaped dome. He remembered her vividly: she was one of his\nsoul\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s intimates. Her body was long and elegant, her face was crushed\ntiny like a beetle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, she had rows of round heavy collars, like a\ncolumn of quoits, on her neck. He remembered her: her astonishing\ncultured elegance, her diminished, beetle face, the astounding long\nelegant body, on short, ugly legs, with such protuberant buttocks, so\nweighty and unexpected below her slim long loins. She knew what he\nhimself did not know. She had thousands of years of purely sensual,\npurely unspiritual knowledge behind her. It must have been thousands of\nyears since her race had died, mystically: that is, since the relation\nbetween the senses and the outspoken mind had broken, leaving the\nexperience all in one sort, mystically sensual. Thousands of years ago,\nthat which was imminent in himself must have taken place in these\nAfricans: the goodness, the holiness, the desire for creation and\nproductive happiness must have lapsed, leaving the single impulse for\nknowledge in one sort, mindless progressive knowledge through the\nsenses, knowledge arrested and ending in the senses, mystic knowledge\nin disintegration and dissolution, knowledge such as the beetles have,\nwhich live purely within the world of corruption and cold dissolution.\nThis was why her face looked like a beetle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s: this was why the\nEgyptians worshipped the ball-rolling scarab: because of the principle\nof knowledge in dissolution and corruption.\n\nThere is a long way we can travel, after the death-break: after that\npoint when the soul in intense suffering breaks, breaks away from its\norganic hold like a leaf that falls. We fall from the connection with\nlife and hope, we lapse from pure integral being, from creation and\nliberty, and we fall into the long, long African process of purely\nsensual understanding, knowledge in the mystery of dissolution.\n\nHe realised now that this is a long process\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094thousands of years it\ntakes, after the death of the creative spirit. He realised that there\nwere great mysteries to be unsealed, sensual, mindless, dreadful\nmysteries, far beyond the phallic cult. How far, in their inverted\nculture, had these West Africans gone beyond phallic knowledge? Very,\nvery far. Birkin recalled again the female figure: the elongated, long,\nlong body, the curious unexpected heavy buttocks, the long, imprisoned\nneck, the face with tiny features like a beetle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. This was far beyond\nany phallic knowledge, sensual subtle realities far beyond the scope of\nphallic investigation.\n\nThere remained this way, this awful African process, to be fulfilled.\nIt would be done differently by the white races. The white races,\nhaving the arctic north behind them, the vast abstraction of ice and\nsnow, would fulfil a mystery of ice-destructive knowledge,\nsnow-abstract annihilation. Whereas the West Africans, controlled by\nthe burning death-abstraction of the Sahara, had been fulfilled in\nsun-destruction, the putrescent mystery of sun-rays.\n\nWas this then all that remained? Was there left now nothing but to\nbreak off from the happy creative being, was the time up? Is our day of\ncreative life finished? Does there remain to us only the strange, awful\nafterwards of the knowledge in dissolution, the African knowledge, but\ndifferent in us, who are blond and blue-eyed from the north?\n\nBirkin thought of Gerald. He was one of these strange white wonderful\ndemons from the north, fulfilled in the destructive frost mystery. And\nwas he fated to pass away in this knowledge, this one process of\nfrost-knowledge, death by perfect cold? Was he a messenger, an omen of\nthe universal dissolution into whiteness and snow?\n\nBirkin was frightened. He was tired too, when he had reached this\nlength of speculation. Suddenly his strange, strained attention gave\nway, he could not attend to these mysteries any more. There was another\nway, the way of freedom. There was the paradisal entry into pure,\nsingle being, the individual soul taking precedence over love and\ndesire for union, stronger than any pangs of emotion, a lovely state of\nfree proud singleness, which accepted the obligation of the permanent\nconnection with others, and with the other, submits to the yoke and\nleash of love, but never forfeits its own proud individual singleness,\neven while it loves and yields.\n\nThere was the other way, the remaining way. And he must run to follow\nit. He thought of Ursula, how sensitive and delicate she really was,\nher skin so over-fine, as if one skin were wanting. She was really so\nmarvellously gentle and sensitive. Why did he ever forget it? He must\ngo to her at once. He must ask her to marry him. They must marry at\nonce, and so make a definite pledge, enter into a definite communion.\nHe must set out at once and ask her, this moment. There was no moment\nto spare.\n\nHe drifted on swiftly to Beldover, half-unconscious of his own\nmovement. He saw the town on the slope of the hill, not straggling, but\nas if walled-in with the straight, final streets of miners\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 dwellings,\nmaking a great square, and it looked like Jerusalem to his fancy. The\nworld was all strange and transcendent.\n\nRosalind opened the door to him. She started slightly, as a young girl\nwill, and said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll tell father.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWith which she disappeared, leaving Birkin in the hall, looking at some\nreproductions from Picasso, lately introduced by Gudrun. He was\nadmiring the almost wizard, sensuous apprehension of the earth, when\nWill Brangwen appeared, rolling down his shirt sleeves.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Brangwen, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll get a coat.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And he too disappeared for a\nmoment. Then he returned, and opened the door of the drawing-room,\nsaying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou must excuse me, I was just doing a bit of work in the shed. Come\ninside, will you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin entered and sat down. He looked at the bright, reddish face of\nthe other man, at the narrow brow and the very bright eyes, and at the\nrather sensual lips that unrolled wide and expansive under the black\ncropped moustache. How curious it was that this was a human being! What\nBrangwen thought himself to be, how meaningless it was, confronted with\nthe reality of him. Birkin could see only a strange, inexplicable,\nalmost patternless collection of passions and desires and suppressions\nand traditions and mechanical ideas, all cast unfused and disunited\ninto this slender, bright-faced man of nearly fifty, who was as\nunresolved now as he was at twenty, and as uncreated. How could he be\nthe parent of Ursula, when he was not created himself. He was not a\nparent. A slip of living flesh had been transmitted through him, but\nthe spirit had not come from him.

But\nhe remained perfectly stiff and still. There was a pause.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve nothing against your marrying Ursula,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Brangwen began at length.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s got nothing to do with me, she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll do as she likes, me or no me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin turned away, looking out of the window and letting go his\nconsciousness. After all, what good was this? It was hopeless to keep\nit up. He would sit on till Ursula came home, then speak to her, then\ngo away. He would not accept trouble at the hands of her father. It was\nall unnecessary, and he himself need not have provoked it.\n\nThe two men sat in complete silence, Birkin almost unconscious of his\nown whereabouts. He had come to ask her to marry him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094well then, he\nwould wait on, and ask her. As for what she said, whether she accepted\nor not, he did not think about it. He would say what he had come to\nsay, and that was all he was conscious of. He accepted the complete\ninsignificance of this household, for him. But everything now was as if\nfated. He could see one thing ahead, and no more. From the rest, he was\nabsolved entirely for the time being. It had to be left to fate and\nchance to resolve the issues.\n\nAt length they heard the gate. They saw her coming up the steps with a\nbundle of books under her arm. Her face was bright and abstracted as\nusual, with the abstraction, that look of being not quite _there_, not\nquite present to the facts of reality, that galled her father so much.\nShe had a maddening faculty of assuming a light of her own, which\nexcluded the reality, and within which she looked radiant as if in\nsunshine.\n\nThey heard her go into the dining-room, and drop her armful of books on\nthe table.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you bring me that Girl\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Own?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Rosalind.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I brought it.

He wondered at her, knowing she was aware of his\npresence. She had her queer, radiant, breathless manner, as if confused\nby the actual world, unreal to it, having a complete bright world of\nher self alone.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave I interrupted a conversation?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, only a complete silence,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, vaguely, absent. Their presence was not vital to\nher, she was withheld, she did not take them in. It was a subtle insult\nthat never failed to exasperate her father.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMr Birkin came to speak to _you_, not to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said her father.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, did he!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she exclaimed vaguely, as if it did not concern her.\nThen, recollecting herself, she turned to him rather radiantly, but\nstill quite superficially, and said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it anything special?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI hope so,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, ironically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094To propose to you, according to all accounts,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said her father.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d mocked her father, imitating her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you nothing more to say?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe winced as if violated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you really come to propose to me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked of Birkin, as if it\nwere a joke.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI suppose I came to propose.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He seemed to fight shy\nof the last word.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, with her vague radiance.

His eyes were flickering with mixed lights, wanting\nsomething of her, yet not wanting it. She shrank a little, as if she\nwere exposed to his eyes, and as if it were a pain to her. She\ndarkened, her soul clouded over, she turned aside. She had been driven\nout of her own radiant, single world. And she dreaded contact, it was\nalmost unnatural to her at these times.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said vaguely, in a doubting, absent voice.\n\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart contracted swiftly, in a sudden fire of bitterness. It\nall meant nothing to her. He had been mistaken again. She was in some\nself-satisfied world of her own. He and his hopes were accidentals,\nviolations to her. It drove her father to a pitch of mad exasperation.\nHe had had to put up with this all his life, from her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, what do you say?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried.\n\nShe winced. Then she glanced down at her father, half-frightened, and\nshe said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t speak, did I?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d as if she were afraid she might have committed\nherself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said her father, exasperated. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut you needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t look like an\nidiot.

But he said nothing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, to help out the occasion, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no need to answer\nat once. You can say when you like.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer eyes flashed with a powerful light.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy should I say anything?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou do this off your _own_\nbat, it has nothing to do with me. Why do you both want to bully me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBully you!

She was set in satisfied defiance. Birkin looked up at her.\nHe too was angry.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut none is bullying you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a very soft dangerous voice\nalso.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou both want to force me into something.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is an illusion of yours,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said ironically.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIllusion!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried her father. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA self-opinionated fool, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s what she\nis.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin rose, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHowever, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll leave it for the time being.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd without another word, he walked out of the house.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou fool! You fool!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d her father cried to her, with extreme bitterness.\nShe left the room, and went upstairs, singing to herself. But she was\nterribly fluttered, as after some dreadful fight. From her window, she\ncould see Birkin going up the road. He went in such a blithe drift of\nrage, that her mind wondered over him. He was ridiculous, but she was\nafraid of him. She was as if escaped from some danger.\n\nHer father sat below, powerless in humiliation and chagrin. It was as\nif he were possessed with all the devils, after one of these\nunaccountable conflicts with Ursula. He hated her as if his only\nreality were in hating her to the last degree. He had all hell in his\nheart. But he went away, to escape himself. He knew he must despair,\nyield, give in to despair, and have done.\n\nUrsula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face closed, she completed herself against them all. Recoiling\nupon herself, she became hard and self-completed, like a jewel. She was\nbright and invulnerable, quite free and happy, perfectly liberated in\nher self-possession. Her father had to learn not to see her blithe\nobliviousness, or it would have sent him mad. She was so radiant with\nall things, in her possession of perfect hostility.\n\nShe would go on now for days like this, in this bright frank state of\nseemingly pure spontaneity, so essentially oblivious of the existence\nof anything but herself, but so ready and facile in her interest. Ah it\nwas a bitter thing for a man to be near her, and her father cursed his\nfatherhood. But he must learn not to see her, not to know.\n\nShe was perfectly stable in resistance when she was in this state: so\nbright and radiant and attractive in her pure opposition, so very pure,\nand yet mistrusted by everybody, disliked on every hand. It was her\nvoice, curiously clear and repellent, that gave her away. Only Gudrun\nwas in accord with her. It was at these times that the intimacy between\nthe two sisters was most complete, as if their intelligence were one.\nThey felt a strong, bright bond of understanding between them,\nsurpassing everything else. And during all these days of blind bright\nabstraction and intimacy of his two daughters, the father seemed to\nbreathe an air of death, as if he were destroyed in his very being. He\nwas irritable to madness, he could not rest, his daughters seemed to be\ndestroying him. But he was inarticulate and helpless against them. He\nwas forced to breathe the air of his own death. He cursed them in his\nsoul, and only wanted, that they should be removed from him.\n\nThey continued radiant in their easy female transcendancy, beautiful to\nlook at. They exchanged confidences, they were intimate in their\nrevelations to the last degree, giving each other at last every secret.\nThey withheld nothing, they told everything, till they were over the\nborder of evil. And they armed each other with knowledge, they\nextracted the subtlest flavours from the apple of knowledge. It was\ncurious how their knowledge was complementary, that of each to that of\nthe other.\n\nUrsula saw her men as sons, pitied their yearning and admired their\ncourage, and wondered over them as a mother wonders over her child,\nwith a certain delight in their novelty. But to Gudrun, they were the\nopposite camp. She feared them and despised them, and respected their\nactivities even overmuch.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said easily, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere is a quality of life in Birkin\nwhich is quite remarkable. There is an extraordinary rich spring of\nlife in him, really amazing, the way he can give himself to things. But\nthere are so many things in life that he simply doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. Either he\nis not aware of their existence at all, or he dismisses them as merely\nnegligible\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094things which are vital to the other person. In a way, he is\nnot clever enough, he is too intense in spots.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ctoo much of a preacher. He is really a priest.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExactly! He can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hear what anybody else has to say\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he simply cannot\nhear. His own voice is so loud.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes. He cries you down.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe cries you down,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd by mere force of violence.\nAnd of course it is hopeless. Nobody is convinced by violence. It makes\ntalking to him impossible\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and living with him I should think would be\nmore than impossible.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think one could live with him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 asked Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think it would be too wearing, too exhausting. One would be shouted\ndown every time, and rushed into his way without any choice. He would\nwant to control you entirely. He cannot allow that there is any other\nmind than his own. And then the real clumsiness of his mind is its lack\nof self-criticism. No, I think it would be perfectly intolerable.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d assented Ursula vaguely. She only half agreed with Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe\nnuisance is,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat one would find almost any man intolerable\nafter a fortnight.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s perfectly dreadful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he is too positive.\nHe couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear it if you called your soul your own. Of him that is\nstrictly true.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou must have _his_ soul.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExactly! And what can you conceive more deadly?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d This was all so true,\nthat Ursula felt jarred to the bottom of her soul with ugly distaste.\n\nShe went on, with the discord jarring and jolting through her, in the\nmost barren of misery.\n\nThen there started a revulsion from Gudrun. She finished life off so\nthoroughly, she made things so ugly and so final. As a matter of fact,\neven if it were as Gudrun said, about Birkin, other things were true as\nwell. But Gudrun would draw two lines under him and cross him out like\nan account that is settled. There he was, summed up, paid for, settled,\ndone with. And it was such a lie. This finality of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, this\ndispatching of people and things in a sentence, it was all such a lie.\nUrsula began to revolt from her sister.\n\nOne day as they were walking along the lane, they saw a robin sitting\non the top twig of a bush, singing shrilly. The sisters stood to look\nat him. An ironical smile flickered on Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he feel important?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d smiled Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Ursula, with a little ironical grimace. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nhe a little Lloyd George of the air!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t he! Little Lloyd George of the air! That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s just what they are,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\ncried Gudrun in delight. Then for days, Ursula saw the persistent,\nobtrusive birds as stout, short politicians lifting up their voices\nfrom the platform, little men who must make themselves heard at any\ncost.\n\nBut even from this there came the revulsion. Some yellowhammers\nsuddenly shot along the road in front of her. And they looked to her so\nuncanny and inhuman, like flaring yellow barbs shooting through the air\non some weird, living errand, that she said to herself: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAfter all, it\nis impudence to call them little Lloyd Georges. They are really unknown\nto us, they are the unknown forces. It is impudence to look at them as\nif they were the same as human beings. They are of another world. How\nstupid anthropomorphism is! Gudrun is really impudent, insolent, making\nherself the measure of everything, making everything come down to human\nstandards. Rupert is quite right, human beings are boring, painting the\nuniverse with their own image. The universe is non-human, thank God.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nIt seemed to her irreverence, destructive of all true life, to make\nlittle Lloyd Georges of the birds. It was such a lie towards the\nrobins, and such a defamation. Yet she had done it herself. But under\nGudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s influence: so she exonerated herself.\n\nSo she withdrew away from Gudrun and from that which she stood for, she\nturned in spirit towards Birkin again. She had not seen him since the\nfiasco of his proposal. She did not want to, because she did not want\nthe question of her acceptance thrust upon her. She knew what Birkin\nmeant when he asked her to marry him; vaguely, without putting it into\nspeech, she knew. She knew what kind of love, what kind of surrender he\nwanted. And she was not at all sure that this was the kind of love that\nshe herself wanted. She was not at all sure that it was this mutual\nunison in separateness that she wanted. She wanted unspeakable\nintimacies. She wanted to have him, utterly, finally to have him as her\nown, oh, so unspeakably, in intimacy. To drink him down\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ah, like a\nlife-draught. She made great professions, to herself, of her\nwillingness to warm his foot-soles between her breasts, after the\nfashion of the nauseous Meredith poem. But only on condition that he,\nher lover, loved her absolutely, with complete self-abandon. And subtly\nenough, she knew he would never abandon himself _finally_ to her. He\ndid not believe in final self-abandonment. He said it openly. It was\nhis challenge. She was prepared to fight him for it. For she believed\nin an absolute surrender to love. She believed that love far surpassed\nthe individual. He said the individual was _more_ than love, or than\nany relationship. For him, the bright, single soul accepted love as one\nof its conditions, a condition of its own equilibrium. She believed\nthat love was _everything_. Man must render himself up to her. He must\nbe quaffed to the dregs by her. Let him be _her man_ utterly, and she\nin return would be his humble slave\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094whether she wanted it or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XX.\n\n\n GLADIATORIAL\n\nAfter the fiasco of the proposal, Birkin had hurried blindly away from\nBeldover, in a whirl of fury. He felt he had been a complete fool, that\nthe whole scene had been a farce of the first water. But that did not\ntrouble him at all. He was deeply, mockingly angry that Ursula\npersisted always in this old cry: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do you want to bully me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d and in\nher bright, insolent abstraction.\n\nHe went straight to Shortlands. There he found Gerald standing with his\nback to the fire, in the library, as motionless as a man is, who is\ncompletely and emptily restless, utterly hollow. He had done all the\nwork he wanted to do\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and now there was nothing. He could go out in the\ncar, he could run to town. But he did not want to go out in the car, he\ndid not want to run to town, he did not want to call on the Thirlbys.\nHe was suspended motionless, in an agony of inertia, like a machine\nthat is without power.\n\nThis was very bitter to Gerald, who had never known what boredom was,\nwho had gone from activity to activity, never at a loss. Now,\ngradually, everything seemed to be stopping in him. He did not want any\nmore to do the things that offered. Something dead within him just\nrefused to respond to any suggestion. He cast over in his mind, what it\nwould be possible to do, to save himself from this misery of\nnothingness, relieve the stress of this hollowness. And there were only\nthree things left, that would rouse him, make him live. One was to\ndrink or smoke hashish, the other was to be soothed by Birkin, and the\nthird was women. And there was no one for the moment to drink with. Nor\nwas there a woman. And he knew Birkin was out. So there was nothing to\ndo but to bear the stress of his own emptiness.\n\nWhen he saw Birkin his face lit up in a sudden, wonderful smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBy God, Rupert,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d just come to the conclusion that\nnothing in the world mattered except somebody to take the edge off\none\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s being alone: the right somebody.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe smile in his eyes was very astonishing, as he looked at the other\nman. It was the pure gleam of relief. His face was pallid and even\nhaggard.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe right woman, I suppose you mean,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin spitefully.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course, for choice. Failing that, an amusing man.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe laughed as he said it. Birkin sat down near the fire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat were you doing?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI? Nothing. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m in a bad way just now, everything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s on edge, and I can\nneither work nor play. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know whether it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a sign of old age, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m\nsure.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou mean you are bored?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBored, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t apply myself. And I feel the devil is\neither very present inside me, or dead.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin glanced up and looked in his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou should try hitting something,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nGerald smiled.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo long as it was something worth hitting.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cQuite!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, in his soft voice. There was a long pause during\nwhich each could feel the presence of the other.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne has to wait,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh God! Waiting! What are we waiting for?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSome old Johnny says there are three cures for _ennui_, sleep, drink,\nand travel,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll cold eggs,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn sleep, you dream, in drink you curse,\nand in travel you yell at a porter.

He took his hands out of his trousers\npockets, and reached for a cigarette. He was tense and nervous. He lit\nthe cigarette over a lamp, reaching forward and drawing steadily.

The room was\nlarge, there was plenty of space, it was thickly carpeted. Then he\nquickly threw off his clothes, and waited for Birkin. The latter, white\nand thin, came over to him. Birkin was more a presence than a visible\nobject, Gerald was aware of him completely, but not really visually.\nWhereas Gerald himself was concrete and noticeable, a piece of pure\nfinal substance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will show you what I learned, and what I\nremember. You let me take you so\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And his hands closed on the naked\nbody of the other man. In another moment, he had Gerald swung over\nlightly and balanced against his knee, head downwards. Relaxed, Gerald\nsprang to his feet with eyes glittering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s smart,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow try again.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSo the two men began to struggle together. They were very dissimilar.\nBirkin was tall and narrow, his bones were very thin and fine. Gerald\nwas much heavier and more plastic. His bones were strong and round, his\nlimbs were rounded, all his contours were beautifully and fully\nmoulded. He seemed to stand with a proper, rich weight on the face of\nthe earth, whilst Birkin seemed to have the centre of gravitation in\nhis own middle. And Gerald had a rich, frictional kind of strength,\nrather mechanical, but sudden and invincible, whereas Birkin was\nabstract as to be almost intangible. He impinged invisibly upon the\nother man, scarcely seeming to touch him, like a garment, and then\nsuddenly piercing in a tense fine grip that seemed to penetrate into\nthe very quick of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s being.\n\nThey stopped, they discussed methods, they practised grips and throws,\nthey became accustomed to each other, to each other\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s rhythm, they got\na kind of mutual physical understanding. And then again they had a real\nstruggle. They seemed to drive their white flesh deeper and deeper\nagainst each other, as if they would break into a oneness. Birkin had a\ngreat subtle energy, that would press upon the other man with an\nuncanny force, weigh him like a spell put upon him. Then it would pass,\nand Gerald would heave free, with white, heaving, dazzling movements.\n\nSo the two men entwined and wrestled with each other, working nearer\nand nearer. Both were white and clear, but Gerald flushed smart red\nwhere he was touched, and Birkin remained white and tense. He seemed to\npenetrate into Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s more solid, more diffuse bulk, to interfuse his\nbody through the body of the other, as if to bring it subtly into\nsubjection, always seizing with some rapid necromantic fore-knowledge\nevery motion of the other flesh, converting and counteracting it,\nplaying upon the limbs and trunk of Gerald like some hard wind. It was\nas if Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s whole physical intelligence interpenetrated into\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s body, as if his fine, sublimated energy entered into the flesh\nof the fuller man, like some potency, casting a fine net, a prison,\nthrough the muscles into the very depths of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s physical being.\n\nSo they wrestled swiftly, rapturously, intent and mindless at last, two\nessential white figures working into a tighter closer oneness of\nstruggle, with a strange, octopus-like knotting and flashing of limbs\nin the subdued light of the room; a tense white knot of flesh gripped\nin silence between the walls of old brown books. Now and again came a\nsharp gasp of breath, or a sound like a sigh, then the rapid thudding\nof movement on the thickly-carpeted floor, then the strange sound of\nflesh escaping under flesh. Often, in the white interlaced knot of\nviolent living being that swayed silently, there was no head to be\nseen, only the swift, tight limbs, the solid white backs, the physical\njunction of two bodies clinched into oneness. Then would appear the\ngleaming, ruffled head of Gerald, as the struggle changed, then for a\nmoment the dun-coloured, shadow-like head of the other man would lift\nup from the conflict, the eyes wide and dreadful and sightless.\n\nAt length Gerald lay back inert on the carpet, his breast rising in\ngreat slow panting, whilst Birkin kneeled over him, almost unconscious.\nBirkin was much more exhausted. He caught little, short breaths, he\ncould scarcely breathe any more. The earth seemed to tilt and sway, and\na complete darkness was coming over his mind. He did not know what\nhappened. He slid forward quite unconscious, over Gerald, and Gerald\ndid not notice. Then he was half-conscious again, aware only of the\nstrange tilting and sliding of the world. The world was sliding,\neverything was sliding off into the darkness. And he was sliding,\nendlessly, endlessly away.\n\nHe came to consciousness again, hearing an immense knocking outside.\nWhat could be happening, what was it, the great hammer-stroke\nresounding through the house? He did not know. And then it came to him\nthat it was his own heart beating. But that seemed impossible, the\nnoise was outside. No, it was inside himself, it was his own heart. And\nthe beating was painful, so strained, surcharged. He wondered if Gerald\nheard it. He did not know whether he were standing or lying or falling.\n\nWhen he realised that he had fallen prostrate upon Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s body he\nwondered, he was surprised. But he sat up, steadying himself with his\nhand and waiting for his heart to become stiller and less painful. It\nhurt very much, and took away his consciousness.\n\nGerald however was still less conscious than Birkin. They waited dimly,\nin a sort of not-being, for many uncounted, unknown minutes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d panted Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t have to be rough\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094with you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I had\nto keep back\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094my force\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBirkin heard the sound as if his own spirit stood behind him, outside\nhim, and listened to it. His body was in a trance of exhaustion, his\nspirit heard thinly. His body could not answer. Only he knew his heart\nwas getting quieter. He was divided entirely between his spirit, which\nstood outside, and knew, and his body, that was a plunging, unconscious\nstroke of blood.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI could have thrown you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094using violence\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d panted Gerald. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut you beat\nme right enough.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, hardening his throat and producing the words in the\ntension there, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re much stronger than I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you could beat me\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094easily.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThen he relaxed again to the terrible plunging of his heart and his\nblood.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt surprised me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d panted Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat strength you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve got.

It drew nearer however, his\nspirit. And the violent striking of blood in his chest was sinking\nquieter, allowing his mind to come back. He realised that he was\nleaning with all his weight on the soft body of the other man. It\nstartled him, because he thought he had withdrawn. He recovered\nhimself, and sat up. But he was still vague and unestablished. He put\nout his hand to steady himself. It touched the hand of Gerald, that was\nlying out on the floor. And Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hand closed warm and sudden over\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, they remained exhausted and breathless, the one hand clasped\nclosely over the other. It was Birkin whose hand, in swift response,\nhad closed in a strong, warm clasp over the hand of the other. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nclasp had been sudden and momentaneous.\n\nThe normal consciousness however was returning, ebbing back. Birkin\ncould breathe almost naturally again. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hand slowly withdrew,\nBirkin slowly, dazedly rose to his feet and went towards the table. He\npoured out a whiskey and soda.

His mind had reverted to\nUrsula. She seemed to return again into his consciousness.

He wore silk socks, and studs of fine workmanship,\nand silk underclothing, and silk braces. Curious! This was another of\nthe differences between them. Birkin was careless and unimaginative\nabout his own appearance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, as if he had been thinking; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nsomething curious about you.

He was looking at the handsome figure of the other man,\nblond and comely in the rich robe, and he was half thinking of the\ndifference between it and himself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so different; as far, perhaps, apart\nas man from woman, yet in another direction.

Come\nwhat might she would be on the wing in a very short time. She received\na letter from Winifred Crich, ornamented with drawings.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather also has been to London, to be examined by the doctors. It made\nhim very tired. They say he must rest a very great deal, so he is\nmostly in bed. He brought me a lovely tropical parrot in faience, of\nDresden ware, also a man ploughing, and two mice climbing up a stalk,\nalso in faience. The mice were Copenhagen ware. They are the best, but\nmice don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t shine so much, otherwise they are very good, their tails are\nslim and long. They all shine nearly like glass. Of course it is the\nglaze, but I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like it. Gerald likes the man ploughing the best,\nhis trousers are torn, he is ploughing with an ox, being I suppose a\nGerman peasant. It is all grey and white, white shirt and grey\ntrousers, but very shiny and clean. Mr Birkin likes the girl best,\nunder the hawthorn blossom, with a lamb, and with daffodils painted on\nher skirts, in the drawing room. But that is silly, because the lamb is\nnot a real lamb, and she is silly too.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDear Miss Brangwen, are you coming back soon, you are very much missed\nhere. I enclose a drawing of father sitting up in bed. He says he hopes\nyou are not going to forsake us. Oh dear Miss Brangwen, I am sure you\nwon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. Do come back and draw the ferrets, they are the most lovely\nnoble darlings in the world. We might carve them in holly-wood, playing\nagainst a background of green leaves. Oh do let us, for they are most\nbeautiful.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather says we might have a studio. Gerald says we could easily have a\nbeautiful one over the stables, it would only need windows to be put in\nthe slant of the roof, which is a simple matter. Then you could stay\nhere all day and work, and we could live in the studio, like two real\nartists, like the man in the picture in the hall, with the frying-pan\nand the walls all covered with drawings. I long to be free, to live the\nfree life of an artist. Even Gerald told father that only an artist is\nfree, because he lives in a creative world of his own\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun caught the drift of the family intentions, in this letter.\nGerald wanted her to be attached to the household at Shortlands, he was\nusing Winifred as his stalking-horse. The father thought only of his\nchild, he saw a rock of salvation in Gudrun. And Gudrun admired him for\nhis perspicacity. The child, moreover, was really exceptional. Gudrun\nwas quite content. She was quite willing, given a studio, to spend her\ndays at Shortlands. She disliked the Grammar School already thoroughly,\nshe wanted to be free. If a studio were provided, she would be free to\ngo on with her work, she would await the turn of events with complete\nserenity. And she was really interested in Winifred, she would be quite\nglad to understand the girl.\n\nSo there was quite a little festivity on Winifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s account, the day\nGudrun returned to Shortlands.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou should make a bunch of flowers to give to Miss Brangwen when she\narrives,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald said smiling to his sister.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Winifred, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s silly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot at all.

Nevertheless, the idea appealed to her. She wanted\nvery much to carry it out. She flitted round the green-houses and the\nconservatory looking wistfully at the flowers on their stems. And the\nmore she looked, the more she _longed_ to have a bunch of the blossoms\nshe saw, the more fascinated she became with her little vision of\nceremony, and the more consumedly shy and self-conscious she grew, till\nshe was almost beside herself. She could not get the idea out of her\nmind. It was as if some haunting challenge prompted her, and she had\nnot enough courage to take it up. So again she drifted into the\ngreen-houses, looking at the lovely roses in their pots, and at the\nvirginal cyclamens, and at the mystic white clusters of a creeper. The\nbeauty, oh the beauty of them, and oh the paradisal bliss, if she\nshould have a perfect bouquet and could give it to Gudrun the next day.\nHer passion and her complete indecision almost made her ill.\n\nAt last she slid to her father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s side.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDaddie\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat, my precious?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut she hung back, the tears almost coming to her eyes, in her\nsensitive confusion. Her father looked at her, and his heart ran hot\nwith tenderness, an anguish of poignant love.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you want to say to me, my love?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDaddie\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d her eyes smiled laconically\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cisn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it silly if I give Miss\nBrangwen some flowers when she comes?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe sick man looked at the bright, knowing eyes of his child, and his\nheart burned with love.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, darling, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not silly.

She half suspected that\nqueens in themselves were a silliness. Yet she so wanted her little\nromantic occasion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall I then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGive Miss Brangwen some flowers?

She\nagain went the round of the green-houses and the conservatory,\ninforming the gardener, in her high, peremptory, simple fashion, of\nwhat she wanted, telling him all the blooms she had selected.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you want these for?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Wilson asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI want them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.

Well you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have a rare poppy-show if you put all the\nthings you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve mentioned into your bouquet.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I want a rare poppy-show.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou do! Then there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no more to be said.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe next day Winifred, in a dress of silvery velvet, and holding a\ngaudy bunch of flowers in her hand, waited with keen impatience in the\nschoolroom, looking down the drive for Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s arrival. It was a wet\nmorning. Under her nose was the strange fragrance of hot-house flowers,\nthe bunch was like a little fire to her, she seemed to have a strange\nnew fire in her heart. This slight sense of romance stirred her like an\nintoxicant.\n\nAt last she saw Gudrun coming, and she ran downstairs to warn her\nfather and Gerald. They, laughing at her anxiety and gravity, came with\nher into the hall. The man-servant came hastening to the door, and\nthere he was, relieving Gudrun of her umbrella, and then of her\nraincoat. The welcoming party hung back till their visitor entered the\nhall.\n\nGudrun was flushed with the rain, her hair was blown in loose little\ncurls, she was like a flower just opened in the rain, the heart of the\nblossom just newly visible, seeming to emit a warmth of retained\nsunshine. Gerald winced in spirit, seeing her so beautiful and unknown.\nShe was wearing a soft blue dress, and her stockings were of dark red.\n\nWinifred advanced with odd, stately formality.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe are so glad you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve come back,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThese are your flowers.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nShe presented the bouquet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMine!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun. She was suspended for a moment, then a vivid\nflush went over her, she was as if blinded for a moment with a flame of\npleasure. Then her eyes, strange and flaming, lifted and looked at the\nfather, and at Gerald. And again Gerald shrank in spirit, as if it\nwould be more than he could bear, as her hot, exposed eyes rested on\nhim. There was something so revealed, she was revealed beyond bearing,\nto his eyes. He turned his face aside. And he felt he would not be able\nto avert her. And he writhed under the imprisonment.\n\nGudrun put her face into the flowers.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how beautiful they are!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in a muffled voice. Then, with\na strange, suddenly revealed passion, she stooped and kissed Winifred.\n\nMr Crich went forward with his hand held out to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI was afraid you were going to run away from us,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, playfully.\n\nGudrun looked up at him with a luminous, roguish, unknown face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to stay in London.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Her voice\nseemed to imply that she was glad to get back to Shortlands, her tone\nwas warm and subtly caressing.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is a good thing,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d smiled the father. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou see you are very\nwelcome here among us.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun only looked into his face with dark-blue, warm, shy eyes. She\nwas unconsciously carried away by her own power.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you look as if you came home in every possible triumph,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Mr Crich\ncontinued, holding her hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, glowing strangely. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t had any triumph till I\ncame here.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh, come, come! We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not going to hear any of those tales.

But she was all aglow with her reception,\ncarried away by this little flattering ceremonial on her behalf.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWinifred,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the father, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chave you a pair of shoes for Miss\nBrangwen? You had better change at once\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun went out with her bouquet in her hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cQuite a remarkable young woman,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the father to Gerald, when she\nhad gone.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gerald briefly, as if he did not like the observation.\n\nMr Crich liked Gudrun to sit with him for half an hour. Usually he was\nashy and wretched, with all the life gnawed out of him. But as soon as\nhe rallied, he liked to make believe that he was just as before, quite\nwell and in the midst of life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not of the outer world, but in the midst\nof a strong essential life. And to this belief, Gudrun contributed\nperfectly. With her, he could get by stimulation those precious\nhalf-hours of strength and exaltation and pure freedom, when he seemed\nto live more than he had ever lived.\n\nShe came to him as he lay propped up in the library. His face was like\nyellow wax, his eyes darkened, as it were sightless. His black beard,\nnow streaked with grey, seemed to spring out of the waxy flesh of a\ncorpse. Yet the atmosphere about him was energetic and playful. Gudrun\nsubscribed to this, perfectly. To her fancy, he was just an ordinary\nman. Only his rather terrible appearance was photographed upon her\nsoul, away beneath her consciousness. She knew that, in spite of his\nplayfulness, his eyes could not change from their darkened vacancy,\nthey were the eyes of a man who is dead.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh, this is Miss Brangwen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, suddenly rousing as she entered,\nannounced by the man-servant. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThomas, put Miss Brangwen a chair\nhere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He looked at her soft, fresh face with pleasure. It\ngave him the illusion of life. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNow, you will have a glass of sherry\nand a little piece of cake. Thomas\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo thank you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. And as soon as she had said it, her heart\nsank horribly. The sick man seemed to fall into a gap of death, at her\ncontradiction. She ought to play up to him, not to contravene him. In\nan instant she was smiling her rather roguish smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like sherry very much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I like almost anything\nelse.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe sick man caught at this straw instantly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot sherry! No! Something else! What then? What is there, Thomas?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPort wine\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094curac\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a7ao\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI would love some cura\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a7ao\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, looking at the sick man\nconfidingly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou would. Well then Thomas, cura\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a7ao\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and a little cake, or a biscuit?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA biscuit,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.

The sick man smiled also,\nelated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no. It is a real project. There is a good room under the roof of\nthe stables\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094with sloping rafters.

The\nthought of the rafters stirred her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think it would? Well, it can be done.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how perfectly splendid for Winifred!

You wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mind spending your days here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf there were a studio to work in,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI could ask for\nnothing better.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs that so?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was really very pleased. But already he was getting tired. She could\nsee the grey, awful semi-consciousness of mere pain and dissolution\ncoming over him again, the torture coming into the vacancy of his\ndarkened eyes. It was not over yet, this process of death. She rose\nsoftly saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps you will sleep. I must look for Winifred.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe went out, telling the nurse that she had left him. Day by day the\ntissue of the sick man was further and further reduced, nearer and\nnearer the process came, towards the last knot which held the human\nbeing in its unity. But this knot was hard and unrelaxed, the will of\nthe dying man never gave way. He might be dead in nine-tenths, yet the\nremaining tenth remained unchanged, till it too was torn apart. With\nhis will he held the unit of himself firm, but the circle of his power\nwas ever and ever reduced, it would be reduced to a point at last, then\nswept away.\n\nTo adhere to life, he must adhere to human relationships, and he caught\nat every straw. Winifred, the butler, the nurse, Gudrun, these were the\npeople who meant all to him, in these last resources. Gerald, in his\nfather\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence, stiffened with repulsion. It was so, to a less\ndegree, with all the other children except Winifred. They could not see\nanything but the death, when they looked at their father. It was as if\nsome subterranean dislike overcame them. They could not see the\nfamiliar face, hear the familiar voice. They were overwhelmed by the\nantipathy of visible and audible death. Gerald could not breathe in his\nfather\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence. He must get out at once. And so, in the same way,\nthe father could not bear the presence of his son. It sent a final\nirritation through the soul of the dying man.\n\nThe studio was made ready, Gudrun and Winifred moved in. They enjoyed\nso much the ordering and the appointing of it. And now they need hardly\nbe in the house at all. They had their meals in the studio, they lived\nthere safely. For the house was becoming dreadful. There were two\nnurses in white, flitting silently about, like heralds of death. The\nfather was confined to his bed, there was a come and go of _sotto voce_\nsisters and brothers and children.\n\nWinifred was her father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s constant visitor. Every morning, after\nbreakfast, she went into his room when he was washed and propped up in\nbed, to spend half an hour with him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you better, Daddie?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him invariably.\n\nAnd invariably he answered:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m a little better, pet.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe held his hand in both her own, lovingly and protectively. And this\nwas very dear to him.\n\nShe ran in again as a rule at lunch time, to tell him the course of\nevents, and every evening, when the curtains were drawn, and his room\nwas cosy, she spent a long time with him. Gudrun was gone home,\nWinifred was alone in the house: she liked best to be with her father.\nThey talked and prattled at random, he always as if he were well, just\nthe same as when he was going about. So that Winifred, with a child\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nsubtle instinct for avoiding the painful things, behaved as if nothing\nserious was the matter. Instinctively, she withheld her attention, and\nwas happy. Yet in her remoter soul, she knew as well as the adults\nknew: perhaps better.\n\nHer father was quite well in his make-belief with her. But when she\nwent away, he relapsed under the misery of his dissolution. But still\nthere were these bright moments, though as his strength waned, his\nfaculty for attention grew weaker, and the nurse had to send Winifred\naway, to save him from exhaustion.\n\nHe never admitted that he was going to die. He knew it was so, he knew\nit was the end. Yet even to himself he did not admit it. He hated the\nfact, mortally. His will was rigid. He could not bear being overcome by\ndeath. For him, there was no death. And yet, at times, he felt a great\nneed to cry out and to wail and complain. He would have liked to cry\naloud to Gerald, so that his son should be horrified out of his\ncomposure. Gerald was instinctively aware of this, and he recoiled, to\navoid any such thing. This uncleanness of death repelled him too much.\nOne should die quickly, like the Romans, one should be master of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nfate in dying as in living. He was convulsed in the clasp of this death\nof his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, as in the coils of the great serpent of Laoco\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6n. The\ngreat serpent had got the father, and the son was dragged into the\nembrace of horrifying death along with him. He resisted always. And in\nsome strange way, he was a tower of strength to his father.\n\nThe last time the dying man asked to see Gudrun he was grey with near\ndeath. Yet he must see someone, he must, in the intervals of\nconsciousness, catch into connection with the living world, lest he\nshould have to accept his own situation. Fortunately he was most of his\ntime dazed and half gone. And he spent many hours dimly thinking of the\npast, as it were, dimly re-living his old experiences. But there were\ntimes even to the end when he was capable of realising what was\nhappening to him in the present, the death that was on him. And these\nwere the times when he called in outside help, no matter whose. For to\nrealise this death that he was dying was a death beyond death, never to\nbe borne. It was an admission never to be made.\n\nGudrun was shocked by his appearance, and by the darkened, almost\ndisintegrated eyes, that still were unconquered and firm.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said in his weakened voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand how are you and Winifred\ngetting on?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, very well indeed,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gudrun.\n\nThere were slight dead gaps in the conversation, as if the ideas called\nup were only elusive straws floating on the dark chaos of the sick\nman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dying.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe studio answers all right?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSplendid. It couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be more beautiful and perfect,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nShe waited for what he would say next.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you think Winifred has the makings of a sculptor?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was strange how hollow the words were, meaningless.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure she has. She will do good things one day.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh! Then her life won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be altogether wasted, you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun was rather surprised.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSure it won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she exclaimed softly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s right.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain Gudrun waited for what he would say.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou find life pleasant, it is good to live, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, with\na pitiful faint smile that was almost too much for Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she smiled\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she would lie at random\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI get a pretty good time I\nbelieve.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s right. A happy nature is a great asset.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain Gudrun smiled, though her soul was dry with repulsion. Did one\nhave to die like this\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094having the life extracted forcibly from one,\nwhilst one smiled and made conversation to the end? Was there no other\nway? Must one go through all the horror of this victory over death, the\ntriumph of the integral will, that would not be broken till it\ndisappeared utterly? One must, it was the only way. She admired the\nself-possession and the control of the dying man exceedingly. But she\nloathed the death itself. She was glad the everyday world held good,\nand she need not recognise anything beyond.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are quite all right here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094nothing we can do for you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094nothing you\nfind wrong in your position?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cExcept that you are too good to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh, well, the fault of that lies with yourself,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, and he felt\na little exultation, that he had made this speech.\n\nHe was still so strong and living! But the nausea of death began to\ncreep back on him, in reaction.\n\nGudrun went away, back to Winifred. Mademoiselle had left, Gudrun\nstayed a good deal at Shortlands, and a tutor came in to carry on\nWinifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s education. But he did not live in the house, he was\nconnected with the Grammar School.\n\nOne day, Gudrun was to drive with Winifred and Gerald and Birkin to\ntown, in the car. It was a dark, showery day. Winifred and Gudrun were\nready and waiting at the door. Winifred was very quiet, but Gudrun had\nnot noticed. Suddenly the child asked, in a voice of unconcern:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think my father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s going to die, Miss Brangwen?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun started.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you truly?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNobody knows for certain. He _may_ die, of course.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe child pondered a few moments, then she asked:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut do you _think_ he will die?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was put almost like a question in geography or science, insistent,\nas if she would force an admission from the adult. The watchful,\nslightly triumphant child was almost diabolical.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo I think he will die?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I do.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut Winifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s large eyes were fixed on her, and the girl did not move.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is very ill,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nA small smile came over Winifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, subtle and sceptical.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_I_ don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe he will,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d the child asserted, mockingly, and she\nmoved away into the drive. Gudrun watched the isolated figure, and her\nheart stood still. Winifred was playing with a little rivulet of water,\nabsorbedly as if nothing had been said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve made a proper dam,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, out of the moist distance.\n\nGerald came to the door from out of the hall behind.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is just as well she doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t choose to believe it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nGudrun looked at him. Their eyes met; and they exchanged a sardonic\nunderstanding.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cJust as well,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nHe looked at her again, and a fire flickered up in his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBest to dance while Rome burns, since it must burn, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nhe said.\n\nShe was rather taken aback. But, gathering herself together, she\nreplied:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094better dance than wail, certainly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo I think.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd they both felt the subterranean desire to let go, to fling away\neverything, and lapse into a sheer unrestraint, brutal and licentious.\nA strange black passion surged up pure in Gudrun. She felt strong. She\nfelt her hands so strong, as if she could tear the world asunder with\nthem. She remembered the abandonments of Roman licence, and her heart\ngrew hot. She knew she wanted this herself also\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or something, something\nequivalent. Ah, if that which was unknown and suppressed in her were\nonce let loose, what an orgiastic and satisfying event it would be. And\nshe wanted it, she trembled slightly from the proximity of the man, who\nstood just behind her, suggestive of the same black licentiousness that\nrose in herself. She wanted it with him, this unacknowledged frenzy.\nFor a moment the clear perception of this preoccupied her, distinct and\nperfect in its final reality. Then she shut it off completely, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe might as well go down to the lodge after Winifred\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we can get in the\ncar there.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo we can,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, going with her.\n\nThey found Winifred at the lodge admiring the litter of purebred white\npuppies. The girl looked up, and there was a rather ugly, unseeing cast\nin her eyes as she turned to Gerald and Gudrun. She did not want to see\nthem.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThree new puppies!

But he shrugged with indifference. It began to\nrain. Here was a change. He stopped the car and got down to put up the\nhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXII.\n\n\n WOMAN TO WOMAN\n\nThey came to the town, and left Gerald at the railway station. Gudrun\nand Winifred were to come to tea with Birkin, who expected Ursula also.\nIn the afternoon, however, the first person to turn up was Hermione.\nBirkin was out, so she went in the drawing-room, looking at his books\nand papers, and playing on the piano. Then Ursula arrived. She was\nsurprised, unpleasantly so, to see Hermione, of whom she had heard\nnothing for some time.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is a surprise to see you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been away at Aix\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, for your health?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe two women looked at each other. Ursula resented Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s long,\ngrave, downward-looking face. There was something of the stupidity and\nthe unenlightened self-esteem of a horse in it. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s got a\nhorse-face,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula said to herself, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cshe runs between blinkers.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d It\ndid seem as if Hermione, like the moon, had only one side to her penny.\nThere was no obverse. She stared out all the time on the narrow, but to\nher, complete world of the extant consciousness. In the darkness, she\ndid not exist. Like the moon, one half of her was lost to life. Her\nself was all in her head, she did not know what it was spontaneously to\nrun or move, like a fish in the water, or a weasel on the grass. She\nmust always _know_.\n\nBut Ursula only suffered from Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s one-sidedness. She only felt\nHermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cool evidence, which seemed to put her down as nothing.\nHermione, who brooded and brooded till she was exhausted with the ache\nof her effort at consciousness, spent and ashen in her body, who gained\nso slowly and with such effort her final and barren conclusions of\nknowledge, was apt, in the presence of other women, whom she thought\nsimply female, to wear the conclusions of her bitter assurance like\njewels which conferred on her an unquestionable distinction,\nestablished her in a higher order of life. She was apt, mentally, to\ncondescend to women such as Ursula, whom she regarded as purely\nemotional. Poor Hermione, it was her one possession, this aching\ncertainty of hers, it was her only justification. She must be confident\nhere, for God knows, she felt rejected and deficient enough elsewhere.\nIn the life of thought, of the spirit, she was one of the elect. And\nshe wanted to be universal. But there was a devastating cynicism at the\nbottom of her. She did not believe in her own universals\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they were\nsham. She did not believe in the inner life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was a trick, not a\nreality. She did not believe in the spiritual world\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was an\naffectation. In the last resort, she believed in Mammon, the flesh, and\nthe devil\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094these at least were not sham. She was a priestess without\nbelief, without conviction, suckled in a creed outworn, and condemned\nto the reiteration of mysteries that were not divine to her. Yet there\nwas no escape. She was a leaf upon a dying tree. What help was there\nthen, but to fight still for the old, withered truths, to die for the\nold, outworn belief, to be a sacred and inviolate priestess of\ndesecrated mysteries? The old great truths _had_ been true. And she was\na leaf of the old great tree of knowledge that was withering now. To\nthe old and last truth then she must be faithful even though cynicism\nand mockery took place at the bottom of her soul.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am so glad to see you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to Ursula, in her slow voice, that\nwas like an incantation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou and Rupert have become quite friends?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is always somewhere in the background.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione paused before she answered. She saw perfectly well the other\nwoman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s vaunt: it seemed truly vulgar.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs he?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said slowly, and with perfect equanimity. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd do you\nthink you will marry?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe question was so calm and mild, so simple and bare and dispassionate\nthat Ursula was somewhat taken aback, rather attracted. It pleased her\nalmost like a wickedness. There was some delightful naked irony in\nHermione.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_He_ wants to, awfully, but I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not so sure.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione watched her with slow calm eyes. She noted this new expression\nof vaunting. How she envied Ursula a certain unconscious positivity!\neven her vulgarity!\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you sure?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, in her easy sing song. She was\nperfectly at her ease, perhaps even rather happy in this conversation.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really love him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula flushed a little at the mild impertinence of this question. And\nyet she could not definitely take offence. Hermione seemed so calmly\nand sanely candid. After all, it was rather great to be able to be so\nsane.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe says it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love he wants,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Hermione was slow and level.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe wants me really to accept him in marriage.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione was silent for some time, watching Ursula with slow, pensive\neyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoes he?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said at length, without expression. Then, rousing, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd\nwhat is it you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want?

Hermione\nshuddered with a strange desire. Ah, if only he had asked _her_ to\nsubserve him, to be his slave! She shuddered with desire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou see I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut exactly in what does\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey had both begun at once, they both stopped. Then, Hermione,\nassuming priority of speech, resumed as if wearily:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTo what does he want you to submit?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe says he wants me to accept him non-emotionally, and finally\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I\nreally don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know _what_ he means.

You see he says one\nthing one day, and another the next\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and he always contradicts himself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd always thinks about himself, and his own dissatisfaction,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nHermione slowly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAs if there were no one but himself concerned.\nThat makes it so impossible.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut immediately she began to retract.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe insists on my accepting God knows what in _him_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she resumed. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\nwants me to accept _him_ as\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094as an absolute\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094But it seems to me he\ndoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to _give_ anything.

After all, the tiresome thing was, he did\nnot want an odalisk, he did not want a slave. Hermione would have been\nhis slave\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there was in her a horrible desire to prostrate herself\nbefore a man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a man who worshipped her, however, and admitted her as the\nsupreme thing. He did not want an odalisk. He wanted a woman to _take_\nsomething from him, to give herself up so much that she could take the\nlast realities of him, the last facts, the last physical facts,\nphysical and unbearable.\n\nAnd if she did, would he acknowledge her? Would he be able to\nacknowledge her through everything, or would he use her just as his\ninstrument, use her for his own private satisfaction, not admitting\nher? That was what the other men had done. They had wanted their own\nshow, and they would not admit her, they turned all she was into\nnothingness. Just as Hermione now betrayed herself as a woman. Hermione\nwas like a man, she believed only in men\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s things. She betrayed the\nwoman in herself.

You need a man physically strong,\nand virile in his will, _not_ a sensitive man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d There was a break, as\nif the pythoness had uttered the oracle, and now the woman went on, in\na rhapsody-wearied voice: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you see, Rupert isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t this, he isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.

Then he is so\nchangeable and unsure of himself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it requires the greatest patience and\nunderstanding to help him. And I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think you are patient. You would\nhave to be prepared to suffer\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094dreadfully. I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _tell_ you how much\nsuffering it would take to make him happy. He lives an _intensely_\nspiritual life, at times\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094too, too wonderful. And then come the\nreactions. I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t speak of what I have been through with him. We have\nbeen together so long, I really do know him, I _do_ know what he is.\nAnd I feel I must say it; I feel it would be perfectly _disastrous_ for\nyou to marry him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094for you even more than for him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Hermione lapsed into\nbitter reverie. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is so uncertain, so unstable\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he wearies, and then\nreacts.

And this utterance seemed to her a mark of\nUrsula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s far distance from herself. For to Hermione suffering was the\ngreatest reality, come what might.

Then Ursula broke into faltering challenge.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m merely a physical woman, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo indeed,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, indeed! But I think you are vital and\nyoung\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a question of years, or even of experience\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is almost\na question of race. Rupert is race-old, he comes of an old race\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and you\nseem to me so young, you come of a young, inexperienced race.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo I!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I think he is awfully young, on one side.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, perhaps childish in many respects. Nevertheless\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey both lapsed into silence. Ursula was filled with deep resentment\nand a touch of hopelessness. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t true,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself,\nsilently addressing her adversary. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t true. And it is _you_ who\nwant a physically strong, bullying man, not I. It is you who want an\nunsensitive man, not I. You _don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ know anything about Rupert, not\nreally, in spite of the years you have had with him. You don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t give him\na woman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s love, you give him an ideal love, and that is why he reacts\naway from you. You don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. You only know the dead things. Any\nkitchen maid would know something about him, you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. What do\nyou think your knowledge is but dead understanding, that doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mean a\nthing. You are so false, and untrue, how could you know anything? What\nis the good of your talking about love\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you untrue spectre of a woman!\nHow can you know anything, when you don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe? You don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe in\nyourself and your own womanhood, so what good is your conceited,\nshallow cleverness\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe two women sat on in antagonistic silence. Hermione felt injured,\nthat all her good intention, all her offering, only left the other\nwoman in vulgar antagonism. But then, Ursula could not understand,\nnever would understand, could never be more than the usual jealous and\nunreasonable female, with a good deal of powerful female emotion,\nfemale attraction, and a fair amount of female understanding, but no\nmind. Hermione had decided long ago that where there was no mind, it\nwas useless to appeal for reason\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094one had merely to ignore the ignorant.\nAnd Rupert\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he had now reacted towards the strongly female, healthy,\nselfish woman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was his reaction for the time being\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there was no\nhelping it all. It was all a foolish backward and forward, a violent\noscillation that would at length be too violent for his coherency, and\nhe would smash and be dead. There was no saving him. This violent and\ndirectionless reaction between animalism and spiritual truth would go\non in him till he tore himself in two between the opposite directions,\nand disappeared meaninglessly out of life. It was no good\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he too was\nwithout unity, without _mind_, in the ultimate stages of living; not\nquite man enough to make a destiny for a woman.\n\nThey sat on till Birkin came in and found them together. He felt at\nonce the antagonism in the atmosphere, something radical and\ninsuperable, and he bit his lip. But he affected a bluff manner.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHello, Hermione, are you back again? How do you feel?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, better.

At least\nthey said they were. We shall be a tea-party. What train did you come\nby, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was rather annoying to see him trying to placate both women at once.\nBoth women watched him, Hermione with deep resentment and pity for him,\nUrsula very impatient. He was nervous and apparently in quite good\nspirits, chattering the conventional commonplaces. Ursula was amazed\nand indignant at the way he made small-talk; he was adept as any _fat_\nin Christendom. She became quite stiff, she would not answer. It all\nseemed to her so false and so belittling.

Then she looked at him with her\nslow, heavy gaze. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBarnes is starting his school of \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6sthetics, and\nOlandese is going to give a set of discourses on the Italian national\npolicy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBoth rubbish,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think so,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhich do you admire, then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI admire both. Barnes is a pioneer. And then I am interested in Italy,\nin her coming to national consciousness.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wish she\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d come to something different from national consciousness,\nthen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cespecially as it only means a sort of\ncommercial-industrial consciousness. I hate Italy and her national\nrant. And I think Barnes is an amateur.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHermione was silent for some moments, in a state of hostility. But yet,\nshe had got Birkin back again into her world! How subtle her influence\nwas, she seemed to start his irritable attention into her direction\nexclusively, in one minute. He was her creature.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou are wrong.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Then a sort of tension came over her,\nshe raised her face like the pythoness inspired with oracles, and went\non, in rhapsodic manner: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Il Sandro mi scrive che ha accolto il pi\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b9\ngrande entusiasmo, tutti i giovani, e fanciulle e ragazzi, sono\ntutti_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She went on in Italian, as if, in thinking of the Italians she\nthought in their language.\n\nHe listened with a shade of distaste to her rhapsody, then he said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFor all that, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like it.

Hermione hated to\nbe broken in upon in this manner. Yet she answered mildly:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, pretty well. I spent several years of my girlhood there, with my\nmother. My mother died in Florence.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a pause, painful to Ursula and to Birkin. Hermione however\nseemed abstracted and calm. Birkin was white, his eyes glowed as if he\nwere in a fever, he was far too over-wrought. How Ursula suffered in\nthis tense atmosphere of strained wills! Her head seemed bound round by\niron bands.\n\nBirkin rang the bell for tea. They could not wait for Gudrun any\nlonger. When the door was opened, the cat walked in.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMicio! Micio!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d called Hermione, in her slow, deliberate sing-song. The\nyoung cat turned to look at her, then, with his slow and stately walk\nhe advanced to her side.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Vieni\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094vieni qu\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Hermione was saying, in her strange caressive,\nprotective voice, as if she were always the elder, the mother superior.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Vieni dire Buon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 Giorno alla zia.

She was born\nin my waste-paper basket in Florence, on the morning of Rupert\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nbirthday. She was his birthday present.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nTea was brought in. Birkin poured out for them. It was strange how\ninviolable was the intimacy which existed between him and Hermione.\nUrsula felt that she was an outsider. The very tea-cups and the old\nsilver was a bond between Hermione and Birkin. It seemed to belong to\nan old, past world which they had inhabited together, and in which\nUrsula was a foreigner. She was almost a parvenue in their old cultured\nmilieu. Her convention was not their convention, their standards were\nnot her standards. But theirs were established, they had the sanction\nand the grace of age. He and she together, Hermione and Birkin, were\npeople of the same old tradition, the same withered deadening culture.\nAnd she, Ursula, was an intruder. So they always made her feel.\n\nHermione poured a little cream into a saucer. The simple way she\nassumed her rights in Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s room maddened and discouraged Ursula.\nThere was a fatality about it, as if it were bound to be. Hermione\nlifted the cat and put the cream before him. He planted his two paws on\nthe edge of the table and bent his gracious young head to drink.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Sicuro che capisce italiano_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_non l\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099avr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0\ndimenticato, la lingua della Mamma._\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe lifted the cat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s head with her long, slow, white fingers, not\nletting him drink, holding him in her power. It was always the same,\nthis joy in power she manifested, peculiarly in power over any male\nbeing. He blinked forbearingly, with a male, bored expression, licking\nhis whiskers. Hermione laughed in her short, grunting fashion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ecco, il bravo ragazzo, com\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a8 superbo, questo!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe made a vivid picture, so calm and strange with the cat. She had a\ntrue static impressiveness, she was a social artist in some ways.\n\nThe cat refused to look at her, indifferently avoided her fingers, and\nbegan to drink again, his nose down to the cream, perfectly balanced,\nas he lapped with his odd little click.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bad for him, teaching him to eat at table,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Hermione, easily assenting.\n\nThen, looking down at the cat, she resumed her old, mocking, humorous\nsing-song.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ti imparano fare brutte cose, brutte cose_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe lifted the Mino\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s white chin on her forefinger, slowly. The young\ncat looked round with a supremely forbearing air, avoided seeing\nanything, withdrew his chin, and began to wash his face with his paw.\nHermione grunted her laughter, pleased.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Bel giovanotto_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nThe cat reached forward again and put his fine white paw on the edge of\nthe saucer. Hermione lifted it down with delicate slowness. This\ndeliberate, delicate carefulness of movement reminded Ursula of Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_No!

She wanted to go away now. It all\nseemed no good. Hermione was established for ever, she herself was\nephemeral and had not yet even arrived.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will go now,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said suddenly.\n\nBirkin looked at her almost in fear\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he so dreaded her anger. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut there\nis no need for such hurry,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she answered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will go.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And turning to Hermione, before there\nwas time to say any more, she held out her hand and said \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d sang Hermione, detaining the hand. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMust you really go\nnow?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I think I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll go,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, her face set, and averted from\nHermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou think you will\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut Ursula had got her hand free.

It was strange, the unreasoning rage and violence Hermione\nroused in her, by her very presence. Ursula knew she gave herself away\nto the other woman, she knew she looked ill-bred, uncouth, exaggerated.\nBut she did not care. She only ran up the road, lest she should go back\nand jeer in the faces of the two she had left behind. For they outraged\nher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\n EXCURSE\n\nNext day Birkin sought Ursula out. It happened to be the half-day at\nthe Grammar School. He appeared towards the end of the morning, and\nasked her, would she drive with him in the afternoon. She consented.\nBut her face was closed and unresponding, and his heart sank.\n\nThe afternoon was fine and dim. He was driving the motor-car, and she\nsat beside him. But still her face was closed against him,\nunresponding. When she became like this, like a wall against him, his\nheart contracted.\n\nHis life now seemed so reduced, that he hardly cared any more. At\nmoments it seemed to him he did not care a straw whether Ursula or\nHermione or anybody else existed or did not exist. Why bother! Why\nstrive for a coherent, satisfied life? Why not drift on in a series of\naccidents\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094like a picaresque novel? Why not? Why bother about human\nrelationships? Why take them seriously-male or female? Why form any\nserious connections at all? Why not be casual, drifting along, taking\nall for what it was worth?\n\nAnd yet, still, he was damned and doomed to the old effort at serious\nliving.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat I bought.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The car was running along a broad\nwhite road, between autumn trees.\n\nHe gave her a little bit of screwed-up paper.

It tilted on\nthe bank. He was a careless driver, yet very quick. But Ursula was\nfrightened. There was always that something regardless in him which\nterrified her. She suddenly felt he might kill her, by making some\ndreadful accident with the motor-car. For a moment she was stony with\nfear.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it rather dangerous, the way you drive?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t dangerous,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.

Surely you ought to give them to Hermione! You belong to\nher.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe did not answer. She remained with the jewels shut in her hand. She\nwanted to try them on her fingers, but something in her would not let\nher. And moreover, she was afraid her hands were too large, she shrank\nfrom the mortification of a failure to put them on any but her little\nfinger. They travelled in silence through the empty lanes.\n\nDriving in a motor-car excited her, she forgot his presence even.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked suddenly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot far from Worksop.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd where are we going?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnywhere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was the answer she liked.\n\nShe opened her hand to look at the rings. They gave her _such_\npleasure, as they lay, the three circles, with their knotted jewels,\nentangled in her palm. She would have to try them on. She did so\nsecretly, unwilling to let him see, so that he should not know her\nfinger was too large for them. But he saw nevertheless. He always saw,\nif she wanted him not to. It was another of his hateful, watchful\ncharacteristics.\n\nOnly the opal, with its thin wire loop, would go on her ring finger.\nAnd she was superstitious. No, there was ill-portent enough, she would\nnot accept this ring from him in pledge.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, putting forward her hand, that was half-closed and\nshrinking. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe others don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t fit me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at the red-glinting, soft stone, on her over-sensitive skin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut opals are unlucky, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said wistfully.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo. I prefer unlucky things.

And she sighed. She knew that, in\naccepting the rings, she was accepting a pledge. Yet fate seemed more\nthan herself. She looked again at the jewels. They were very beautiful\nto her eyes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not as ornament, or wealth, but as tiny fragments of\nloveliness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m glad you bought them,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, putting her hand, half\nunwillingly, gently on his arm.\n\nHe smiled, slightly. He wanted her to come to him. But he was angry at\nthe bottom of his soul, and indifferent. He knew she had a passion for\nhim, really. But it was not finally interesting. There were depths of\npassion when one became impersonal and indifferent, unemotional.\nWhereas Ursula was still at the emotional personal level\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094always so\nabominably personal. He had taken her as he had never been taken\nhimself. He had taken her at the roots of her darkness and shame\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094like a\ndemon, laughing over the fountain of mystic corruption which was one of\nthe sources of her being, laughing, shrugging, accepting, accepting\nfinally. As for her, when would she so much go beyond herself as to\naccept him at the quick of death?\n\nShe now became quite happy. The motor-car ran on, the afternoon was\nsoft and dim. She talked with lively interest, analysing people and\ntheir motives\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Gudrun, Gerald. He answered vaguely. He was not very much\ninterested any more in personalities and in people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094people were all\ndifferent, but they were all enclosed nowadays in a definite\nlimitation, he said; there were only about two great ideas, two great\nstreams of activity remaining, with various forms of reaction\ntherefrom. The reactions were all varied in various people, but they\nfollowed a few great laws, and intrinsically there was no difference.\nThey acted and reacted involuntarily according to a few great laws, and\nonce the laws, the great principles, were known, people were no longer\nmystically interesting. They were all essentially alike, the\ndifferences were only variations on a theme. None of them transcended\nthe given terms.\n\nUrsula did not agree\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094people were still an adventure to her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094perhaps\nnot as much as she tried to persuade herself. Perhaps there was\nsomething mechanical, now, in her interest. Perhaps also her interest\nwas destructive, her analysing was a real tearing to pieces. There was\nan under-space in her where she did not care for people and their\nidiosyncracies, even to destroy them. She seemed to touch for a moment\nthis undersilence in herself, she became still, and she turned for a\nmoment purely to Birkin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it be lovely to go home in the dark?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe might have\ntea rather late\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and have high tea?

I suppose I ought to say good-bye to her. I shall\nnever see her again.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula drew away, closed in a violent silence. He knitted his brows,\nand his eyes began to sparkle again in anger.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mind, do you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked irritably.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care.

She means much more to _you_, if it\ncomes to that, than she does to me. For you can only revolt in pure\nreaction from her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and to be her opposite is to be her counterpart.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh, opposite!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know your dodges.

But then you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve nothing to do with\nme.\n\nIn his inflamed, overwrought exasperation, he stopped the car, and they\nsat there, in the middle of the country lane, to have it out. It was a\ncrisis of war between them, so they did not see the ridiculousness of\ntheir situation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf you weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a fool, if only you weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a fool,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried in bitter\ndespair, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d see that one could be decent, even when one has been\nwrong.

You belong\nto that old, deathly way of living\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then go back to it. But don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come\nto me, for I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve nothing to do with it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd in the stress of her violent emotion, she got down from the car and\nwent to the hedgerow, picking unconsciously some flesh-pink\nspindleberries, some of which were burst, showing their orange seeds.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh, you are a fool,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried, bitterly, with some contempt.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, I am. I _am_ a fool. And thank God for it. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m too big a fool to\nswallow your cleverness. God be praised.

Go to your spiritual brides\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\ncome to me as well, because I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not having any, thank you. You\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not\nsatisfied, are you? Your spiritual brides can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t give you what you want,\nthey aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t common and fleshy enough for you, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they? So you come\nto me, and keep them in the background! You will marry me for daily\nuse. But you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll keep yourself well provided with spiritual brides in\nthe background. I know your dirty little game.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Suddenly a flame ran\nover her, and she stamped her foot madly on the road, and he winced,\nafraid that she would strike him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd _I, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m_ not spiritual enough,\n_I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m_ not as spiritual as that Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Her brows knitted, her eyes\nblazed like a tiger\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen _go_ to her, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all I say, _go_ to\nher, _go_. Ha, she spiritual\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094_spiritual_, she! A dirty materialist as\nshe is. _She_ spiritual? What does she care for, what is her\nspirituality? What _is_ it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Her fury seemed to blaze out and burn his\nface. He shrank a little. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI tell you it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s _dirt, dirt_, and nothing\n_but_ dirt. And it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dirt you want, you crave for it. Spiritual! Is\n_that_ spiritual, her bullying, her conceit, her sordid materialism?\nShe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a fishwife, a fishwife, she is such a materialist. And all so\nsordid. What does she work out to, in the end, with all her social\npassion, as you call it. Social passion\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what social passion has\nshe?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094show it me!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094where is it? She wants petty, immediate _power_, she\nwants the illusion that she is a great woman, that is all. In her soul\nshe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a devilish unbeliever, common as dirt. That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s what she is at the\nbottom. And all the rest is pretence\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but you love it. You love the sham\nspirituality, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s your food. And why? Because of the dirt underneath.\nDo you think I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know the foulness of your sex life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I\ndo.

A wonderful tenderness burned in him, at\nthe sight of her quivering, so sensitive fingers: and at the same time\nhe was full of rage and callousness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis is a degrading exhibition,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said coolly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, degrading indeed,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut more to me than to you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSince you choose to degrade yourself,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.

He knew she was in the main\nright. He knew he was perverse, so spiritual on the one hand, and in\nsome strange way, degraded, on the other. But was she herself any\nbetter? Was anybody any better?\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt may all be true, lies and stink and all,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nspiritual intimacy is no rottener than your emotional-jealous intimacy.\nOne can preserve the decencies, even to one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s enemies: for one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s own\nsake.

The rings were still on her\nfingers, two on her little finger, one on her ring finger. Still she\nhesitated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery good,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe only hopeless thing is a fool.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are quite right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nStill she hesitated. Then an ugly, malevolent look came over her face,\nshe pulled the rings from her fingers, and tossed them at him. One\ntouched his face, the others hit his coat, and they scattered into the\nmud.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd take your rings,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand go and buy yourself a female\nelsewhere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there are plenty to be had, who will be quite glad to share\nyour spiritual mess,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or to have your physical mess, and leave your\nspiritual mess to Hermione.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nWith which she walked away, desultorily, up the road. He stood\nmotionless, watching her sullen, rather ugly walk. She was sullenly\npicking and pulling at the twigs of the hedge as she passed. She grew\nsmaller, she seemed to pass out of his sight. A darkness came over his\nmind. Only a small, mechanical speck of consciousness hovered near him.\n\nHe felt tired and weak. Yet also he was relieved. He gave up his old\nposition. He went and sat on the bank. No doubt Ursula was right. It\nwas true, really, what she said. He knew that his spirituality was\nconcomitant of a process of depravity, a sort of pleasure in\nself-destruction. There really _was_ a certain stimulant in\nself-destruction, for him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094especially when it was translated\nspiritually. But then he knew it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he knew it, and had done. And was not\nUrsula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s way of emotional intimacy, emotional and physical, was it not\njust as dangerous as Hermione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s abstract spiritual intimacy? Fusion,\nfusion, this horrible fusion of two beings, which every woman and most\nmen insisted on, was it not nauseous and horrible anyhow, whether it\nwas a fusion of the spirit or of the emotional body? Hermione saw\nherself as the perfect Idea, to which all men must come: And Ursula was\nthe perfect Womb, the bath of birth, to which all men must come! And\nboth were horrible. Why could they not remain individuals, limited by\ntheir own limits? Why this dreadful all-comprehensiveness, this hateful\ntyranny? Why not leave the other being, free, why try to absorb, or\nmelt, or merge? One might abandon oneself utterly to the _moments_, but\nnot to any other being.\n\nHe could not bear to see the rings lying in the pale mud of the road.\nHe picked them up, and wiped them unconsciously on his hands. They were\nthe little tokens of the reality of beauty, the reality of happiness in\nwarm creation. But he had made his hands all dirty and gritty.\n\nThere was a darkness over his mind. The terrible knot of consciousness\nthat had persisted there like an obsession was broken, gone, his life\nwas dissolved in darkness over his limbs and his body. But there was a\npoint of anxiety in his heart now. He wanted her to come back. He\nbreathed lightly and regularly like an infant, that breathes\ninnocently, beyond the touch of responsibility.\n\nShe was coming back. He saw her drifting desultorily under the high\nhedge, advancing towards him slowly. He did not move, he did not look\nagain. He was as if asleep, at peace, slumbering and utterly relaxed.\n\nShe came up and stood before him, hanging her head.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSee what a flower I found you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, wistfully holding a piece of\npurple-red bell-heather under his face. He saw the clump of coloured\nbells, and the tree-like, tiny branch: also her hands, with their\nover-fine, over-sensitive skin.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPretty!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, looking up at her with a smile, taking the flower.\nEverything had become simple again, quite simple, the complexity gone\ninto nowhere. But he badly wanted to cry: except that he was weary and\nbored by emotion.\n\nThen a hot passion of tenderness for her filled his heart. He stood up\nand looked into her face. It was new and oh, so delicate in its\nluminous wonder and fear. He put his arms round her, and she hid her\nface on his shoulder.\n\nIt was peace, just simple peace, as he stood folding her quietly there\non the open lane. It was peace at last. The old, detestable world of\ntension had passed away at last, his soul was strong and at ease.\n\nShe looked up at him. The wonderful yellow light in her eyes now was\nsoft and yielded, they were at peace with each other. He kissed her,\nsoftly, many, many times. A laugh came into her eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid I abuse you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nHe smiled too, and took her hand, that was so soft and given.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNever mind,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cit is all for the good.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He kissed her again,\nsoftly, many times.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCertainly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWait! I shall have my own back.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe laughed suddenly, with a wild catch in her voice, and flung her\narms around him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are mine, my love, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried straining him close.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, softly.\n\nHis voice was so soft and final, she went very still, as if under a\nfate which had taken her. Yes, she acquiesced\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but it was accomplished\nwithout her acquiescence. He was kissing her quietly, repeatedly, with\na soft, still happiness that almost made her heart stop beating.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, lifting her face and looking with frightened,\ngentle wonder of bliss. Was it all real? But his eyes were beautiful\nand soft and immune from stress or excitement, beautiful and smiling\nlightly to her, smiling with her. She hid her face on his shoulder,\nhiding before him, because he could see her so completely. She knew he\nloved her, and she was afraid, she was in a strange element, a new\nheaven round about her. She wished he were passionate, because in\npassion she was at home. But this was so still and frail, as space is\nmore frightening than force.\n\nAgain, quickly, she lifted her head.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you love me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, quickly, impulsively.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, not heeding her motion, only her stillness.\n\nShe knew it was true. She broke away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo you ought,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, turning round to look at the road. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you\nfind the rings?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn my pocket.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe put her hand into his pocket and took them out.\n\nShe was restless.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we go?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered. And they mounted to the car once more, and left\nbehind them this memorable battle-field.\n\nThey drifted through the wild, late afternoon, in a beautiful motion\nthat was smiling and transcendent. His mind was sweetly at ease, the\nlife flowed through him as from some new fountain, he was as if born\nout of the cramp of a womb.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you happy?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him, in her strange, delighted way.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo am I,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried in sudden ecstacy, putting her arm round him and\nclutching him violently against her, as he steered the motor-car.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t drive much more,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want you to be always doing\nsomething.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll finish this little trip, and then we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be free.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will, my love, we will,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried in delight, kissing him as he\nturned to her.\n\nHe drove on in a strange new wakefulness, the tension of his\nconsciousness broken. He seemed to be conscious all over, all his body\nawake with a simple, glimmering awareness, as if he had just come\nawake, like a thing that is born, like a bird when it comes out of an\negg, into a new universe.\n\nThey dropped down a long hill in the dusk, and suddenly Ursula\nrecognised on her right hand, below in the hollow, the form of\nSouthwell Minster.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre we here!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried with pleasure.\n\nThe rigid, sombre, ugly cathedral was settling under the gloom of the\ncoming night, as they entered the narrow town, the golden lights showed\nlike slabs of revelation, in the shop-windows.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather came here with mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhen they first knew each\nother. He loves it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he loves the Minster. Do you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes. It looks like quartz crystals sticking up out of the dark hollow.\nWe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have our high tea at the Saracen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Head.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAs they descended, they heard the Minster bells playing a hymn, when\nthe hour had struck six.\n\nGlory to thee my God this night\nFor all the blessings of the light\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\n\nSo, to Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ear, the tune fell out, drop by drop, from the unseen\nsky on to the dusky town. It was like dim, bygone centuries sounding.\nIt was all so far off. She stood in the old yard of the inn, smelling\nof straw and stables and petrol. Above, she could see the first stars.\nWhat was it all? This was no actual world, it was the dream-world of\none\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s childhood\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a great circumscribed reminiscence. The world had\nbecome unreal. She herself was a strange, transcendent reality.\n\nThey sat together in a little parlour by the fire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs it true?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, wondering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cEverything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094is everything true?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe best is true,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, grimacing at her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, laughing, but unassured.\n\nShe looked at him. He seemed still so separate. New eyes were opened in\nher soul. She saw a strange creature from another world, in him. It was\nas if she were enchanted, and everything were metamorphosed. She\nrecalled again the old magic of the Book of Genesis, where the sons of\nGod saw the daughters of men, that they were fair. And he was one of\nthese, one of these strange creatures from the beyond, looking down at\nher, and seeing she was fair.\n\nHe stood on the hearth-rug looking at her, at her face that was\nupturned exactly like a flower, a fresh, luminous flower, glinting\nfaintly golden with the dew of the first light. And he was smiling\nfaintly as if there were no speech in the world, save the silent\ndelight of flowers in each other. Smilingly they delighted in each\nother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s presence, pure presence, not to be thought of, even known. But\nhis eyes had a faintly ironical contraction.\n\nAnd she was drawn to him strangely, as in a spell. Kneeling on the\nhearth-rug before him, she put her arms round his loins, and put her\nface against his thigh. Riches! Riches! She was overwhelmed with a\nsense of a heavenful of riches.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe love each other,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said in delight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMore than that,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, looking down at her with his glimmering,\neasy face.\n\nUnconsciously, with her sensitive fingertips, she was tracing the back\nof his thighs, following some mysterious life-flow there. She had\ndiscovered something, something more than wonderful, more wonderful\nthan life itself. It was the strange mystery of his life-motion, there,\nat the back of the thighs, down the flanks. It was a strange reality of\nhis being, the very stuff of being, there in the straight downflow of\nthe thighs. It was here she discovered him one of the sons of God such\nas were in the beginning of the world, not a man, something other,\nsomething more.\n\nThis was release at last. She had had lovers, she had known passion.\nBut this was neither love nor passion. It was the daughters of men\ncoming back to the sons of God, the strange inhuman sons of God who are\nin the beginning.\n\nHer face was now one dazzle of released, golden light, as she looked up\nat him, and laid her hands full on his thighs, behind, as he stood\nbefore her. He looked down at her with a rich bright brow like a diadem\nabove his eyes. She was beautiful as a new marvellous flower opened at\nhis knees, a paradisal flower she was, beyond womanhood, such a flower\nof luminousness. Yet something was tight and unfree in him. He did not\nlike this crouching, this radiance\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not altogether.\n\nIt was all achieved, for her. She had found one of the sons of God from\nthe Beginning, and he had found one of the first most luminous\ndaughters of men.\n\nShe traced with her hands the line of his loins and thighs, at the\nback, and a living fire ran through her, from him, darkly. It was a\ndark flood of electric passion she released from him, drew into\nherself. She had established a rich new circuit, a new current of\npassional electric energy, between the two of them, released from the\ndarkest poles of the body and established in perfect circuit. It was a\ndark fire of electricity that rushed from him to her, and flooded them\nboth with rich peace, satisfaction.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, lifting her face to him, her eyes, her mouth open\nin transport.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, bending and kissing her, always kissing her.\n\nShe closed her hands over the full, rounded body of his loins, as he\nstooped over her, she seemed to touch the quick of the mystery of\ndarkness that was bodily him. She seemed to faint beneath, and he\nseemed to faint, stooping over her. It was a perfect passing away for\nboth of them, and at the same time the most intolerable accession into\nbeing, the marvellous fullness of immediate gratification,\noverwhelming, out-flooding from the source of the deepest life-force,\nthe darkest, deepest, strangest life-source of the human body, at the\nback and base of the loins.\n\nAfter a lapse of stillness, after the rivers of strange dark fluid\nrichness had passed over her, flooding, carrying away her mind and\nflooding down her spine and down her knees, past her feet, a strange\nflood, sweeping away everything and leaving her an essential new being,\nshe was left quite free, she was free in complete ease, her complete\nself. So she rose, stilly and blithe, smiling at him. He stood before\nher, glimmering, so awfully real, that her heart almost stopped\nbeating. He stood there in his strange, whole body, that had its\nmarvellous fountains, like the bodies of the sons of God who were in\nthe beginning. There were strange fountains of his body, more\nmysterious and potent than any she had imagined or known, more\nsatisfying, ah, finally, mystically-physically satisfying. She had\nthought there was no source deeper than the phallic source. And now,\nbehold, from the smitten rock of the man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s body, from the strange\nmarvellous flanks and thighs, deeper, further in mystery than the\nphallic source, came the floods of ineffable darkness and ineffable\nriches.\n\nThey were glad, and they could forget perfectly. They laughed, and went\nto the meal provided. There was a venison pasty, of all things, a large\nbroad-faced cut ham, eggs and cresses and red beet-root, and medlars\nand apple-tart, and tea.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat _good_ things!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried with pleasure. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow noble it\nlooks!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094shall I pour out the tea?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was usually nervous and uncertain at performing these public\nduties, such as giving tea.

Pity to go anywhere on this good dark night. Pity to come\nout of it, really. Pity we can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t stop in the good darkness. It is\nbetter than anything ever would be\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094this good immediate darkness.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe sat wondering. The car lurched and swayed. She knew there was no\nleaving him, the darkness held them both and contained them, it was not\nto be surpassed. Besides she had a full mystic knowledge of his suave\nloins of darkness, dark-clad and suave, and in this knowledge there was\nsome of the inevitability and the beauty of fate, fate which one asks\nfor, which one accepts in full.\n\nHe sat still like an Egyptian Pharoah, driving the car. He felt as if\nhe were seated in immemorial potency, like the great carven statues of\nreal Egypt, as real and as fulfilled with subtle strength, as these\nare, with a vague inscrutable smile on the lips. He knew what it was to\nhave the strange and magical current of force in his back and loins,\nand down his legs, force so perfect that it stayed him immobile, and\nleft his face subtly, mindlessly smiling. He knew what it was to be\nawake and potent in that other basic mind, the deepest physical mind.\nAnd from this source he had a pure and magic control, magical,\nmystical, a force in darkness, like electricity.\n\nIt was very difficult to speak, it was so perfect to sit in this pure\nliving silence, subtle, full of unthinkable knowledge and unthinkable\nforce, upheld immemorially in timeless force, like the immobile,\nsupremely potent Egyptians, seated forever in their living, subtle\nsilence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe need not go home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis car has seats that let down and\nmake a bed, and we can lift the hood.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was glad and frightened. She cowered near to him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut what about them at home?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSend a telegram.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nNothing more was said. They ran on in silence. But with a sort of\nsecond consciousness he steered the car towards a destination. For he\nhad the free intelligence to direct his own ends. His arms and his\nbreast and his head were rounded and living like those of the Greek, he\nhad not the unawakened straight arms of the Egyptian, nor the sealed,\nslumbering head. A lambent intelligence played secondarily above his\npure Egyptian concentration in darkness.\n\nThey came to a village that lined along the road. The car crept slowly\nalong, until he saw the post-office. Then he pulled up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will send a telegram to your father,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will merely say\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098spending the night in town,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 shall I?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she answered. She did not want to be disturbed into taking\nthought.\n\nShe watched him move into the post-office. It was also a shop, she saw.\nStrange, he was. Even as he went into the lighted, public place he\nremained dark and magic, the living silence seemed the body of reality\nin him, subtle, potent, indiscoverable. There he was! In a strange\nuplift of elation she saw him, the being never to be revealed, awful in\nits potency, mystic and real. This dark, subtle reality of him, never\nto be translated, liberated her into perfection, her own perfected\nbeing. She too was dark and fulfilled in silence.\n\nHe came out, throwing some packages into the car.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is some bread, and cheese, and raisins, and apples, and hard\nchocolate,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in his voice that was as if laughing, because of\nthe unblemished stillness and force which was the reality in him. She\nwould have to touch him. To speak, to see, was nothing. It was a\ntravesty to look and to comprehend the man there. Darkness and silence\nmust fall perfectly on her, then she could know mystically, in\nunrevealed touch. She must lightly, mindlessly connect with him, have\nthe knowledge which is death of knowledge, the reality of surety in\nnot-knowing.\n\nSoon they had run on again into the darkness. She did not ask where\nthey were going, she did not care. She sat in a fullness and a pure\npotency that was like apathy, mindless and immobile. She was next to\nhim, and hung in a pure rest, as a star is hung, balanced unthinkably.\nStill there remained a dark lambency of anticipation. She would touch\nhim. With perfect fine finger-tips of reality she would touch the\nreality in him, the suave, pure, untranslatable reality of his loins of\ndarkness. To touch, mindlessly in darkness to come in pure touching\nupon the living reality of him, his suave perfect loins and thighs of\ndarkness, this was her sustaining anticipation.\n\nAnd he too waited in the magical steadfastness of suspense, for her to\ntake this knowledge of him as he had taken it of her. He knew her\ndarkly, with the fullness of dark knowledge. Now she would know him,\nand he too would be liberated. He would be night-free, like an\nEgyptian, steadfast in perfectly suspended equilibrium, pure mystic\nnodality of physical being. They would give each other this\nstar-equilibrium which alone is freedom.\n\nShe saw that they were running among trees\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094great old trees with dying\nbracken undergrowth. The palish, gnarled trunks showed ghostly, and\nlike old priests in the hovering distance, the fern rose magical and\nmysterious. It was a night all darkness, with low cloud. The motor-car\nadvanced slowly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere are we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn Sherwood Forest.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was evident he knew the place. He drove softly, watching. Then they\ncame to a green road between the trees. They turned cautiously round,\nand were advancing between the oaks of the forest, down a green lane.\nThe green lane widened into a little circle of grass, where there was a\nsmall trickle of water at the bottom of a sloping bank. The car\nstopped.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will stay here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand put out the lights.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe extinguished the lamps at once, and it was pure night, with shadows\nof trees like realities of other, nightly being. He threw a rug on to\nthe bracken, and they sat in stillness and mindless silence. There were\nfaint sounds from the wood, but no disturbance, no possible\ndisturbance, the world was under a strange ban, a new mystery had\nsupervened. They threw off their clothes, and he gathered her to him,\nand found her, found the pure lambent reality of her forever invisible\nflesh. Quenched, inhuman, his fingers upon her unrevealed nudity were\nthe fingers of silence upon silence, the body of mysterious night upon\nthe body of mysterious night, the night masculine and feminine, never\nto be seen with the eye, or known with the mind, only known as a\npalpable revelation of living otherness.\n\nShe had her desire of him, she touched, she received the maximum of\nunspeakable communication in touch, dark, subtle, positively silent, a\nmagnificent gift and give again, a perfect acceptance and yielding, a\nmystery, the reality of that which can never be known, vital, sensual\nreality that can never be transmuted into mind content, but remains\noutside, living body of darkness and silence and subtlety, the mystic\nbody of reality. She had her desire fulfilled. He had his desire\nfulfilled. For she was to him what he was to her, the immemorial\nmagnificence of mystic, palpable, real otherness.\n\nThey slept the chilly night through under the hood of the car, a night\nof unbroken sleep. It was already high day when he awoke. They looked\nat each other and laughed, then looked away, filled with darkness and\nsecrecy. Then they kissed and remembered the magnificence of the night.\nIt was so magnificent, such an inheritance of a universe of dark\nreality, that they were afraid to seem to remember. They hid away the\nremembrance and the knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\n DEATH AND LOVE\n\nThomas Crich died slowly, terribly slowly. It seemed impossible to\neverybody that the thread of life could be drawn out so thin, and yet\nnot break. The sick man lay unutterably weak and spent, kept alive by\nmorphia and by drinks, which he sipped slowly. He was only half\nconscious\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a thin strand of consciousness linking the darkness of death\nwith the light of day. Yet his will was unbroken, he was integral,\ncomplete. Only he must have perfect stillness about him.\n\nAny presence but that of the nurses was a strain and an effort to him\nnow. Every morning Gerald went into the room, hoping to find his father\npassed away at last. Yet always he saw the same transparent face, the\nsame dread dark hair on the waxen forehead, and the awful, inchoate\ndark eyes, which seemed to be decomposing into formless darkness,\nhaving only a tiny grain of vision within them.\n\nAnd always, as the dark, inchoate eyes turned to him, there passed\nthrough Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bowels a burning stroke of revolt, that seemed to\nresound through his whole being, threatening to break his mind with its\nclangour, and making him mad.\n\nEvery morning, the son stood there, erect and taut with life, gleaming\nin his blondness. The gleaming blondness of his strange, imminent being\nput the father into a fever of fretful irritation. He could not bear to\nmeet the uncanny, downward look of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blue eyes. But it was only\nfor a moment. Each on the brink of departure, the father and son looked\nat each other, then parted.\n\nFor a long time Gerald preserved a perfect _sang-froid_, he remained\nquite collected. But at last, fear undermined him. He was afraid of\nsome horrible collapse in himself. He had to stay and see this thing\nthrough. Some perverse will made him watch his father drawn over the\nborders of life. And yet, now, every day, the great red-hot stroke of\nhorrified fear through the bowels of the son struck a further\ninflammation. Gerald went about all day with a tendency to cringe, as\nif there were the point of a sword of Damocles pricking the nape of his\nneck.\n\nThere was no escape\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was bound up with his father, he had to see him\nthrough. And the father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s will never relaxed or yielded to death. It\nwould have to snap when death at last snapped it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if it did not persist\nafter a physical death. In the same way, the will of the son never\nyielded. He stood firm and immune, he was outside this death and this\ndying.\n\nIt was a trial by ordeal. Could he stand and see his father slowly\ndissolve and disappear in death, without once yielding his will,\nwithout once relenting before the omnipotence of death. Like a Red\nIndian undergoing torture, Gerald would experience the whole process of\nslow death without wincing or flinching. He even triumphed in it. He\nsomehow _wanted_ this death, even forced it. It was as if he himself\nwere dealing the death, even when he most recoiled in horror. Still, he\nwould deal it, he would triumph through death.\n\nBut in the stress of this ordeal, Gerald too lost his hold on the\nouter, daily life. That which was much to him, came to mean nothing.\nWork, pleasure\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was all left behind. He went on more or less\nmechanically with his business, but this activity was all extraneous.\nThe real activity was this ghastly wrestling for death in his own soul.\nAnd his own will should triumph. Come what might, he would not bow down\nor submit or acknowledge a master. He had no master in death.\n\nBut as the fight went on, and all that he had been and was continued to\nbe destroyed, so that life was a hollow shell all round him, roaring\nand clattering like the sound of the sea, a noise in which he\nparticipated externally, and inside this hollow shell was all the\ndarkness and fearful space of death, he knew he would have to find\nreinforcements, otherwise he would collapse inwards upon the great dark\nvoid which circled at the centre of his soul. His will held his outer\nlife, his outer mind, his outer being unbroken and unchanged. But the\npressure was too great. He would have to find something to make good\nthe equilibrium. Something must come with him into the hollow void of\ndeath in his soul, fill it up, and so equalise the pressure within to\nthe pressure without. For day by day he felt more and more like a\nbubble filled with darkness, round which whirled the iridescence of his\nconsciousness, and upon which the pressure of the outer world, the\nouter life, roared vastly.\n\nIn this extremity his instinct led him to Gudrun. He threw away\neverything now\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he only wanted the relation established with her. He\nwould follow her to the studio, to be near her, to talk to her. He\nwould stand about the room, aimlessly picking up the implements, the\nlumps of clay, the little figures she had cast\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they were whimsical and\ngrotesque\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094looking at them without perceiving them. And she felt him\nfollowing her, dogging her heels like a doom. She held away from him,\nand yet she knew he drew always a little nearer, a little nearer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI say,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to her one evening, in an odd, unthinking, uncertain\nway, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you stay to dinner tonight? I wish you would.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe started slightly. He spoke to her like a man making a request of\nanother man.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll be expecting me at home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, they won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t mind, will they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI should be awfully glad if\nyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d stay.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer long silence gave consent at last.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll tell Thomas, shall I?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI must go almost immediately after dinner,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nIt was a dark, cold evening. There was no fire in the drawing-room,\nthey sat in the library. He was mostly silent, absent, and Winifred\ntalked little. But when Gerald did rouse himself, he smiled and was\npleasant and ordinary with her. Then there came over him again the long\nblanks, of which he was not aware.\n\nShe was very much attracted by him. He looked so preoccupied, and his\nstrange, blank silences, which she could not read, moved her and made\nher wonder over him, made her feel reverential towards him.\n\nBut he was very kind. He gave her the best things at the table, he had\na bottle of slightly sweet, delicious golden wine brought out for\ndinner, knowing she would prefer it to the burgundy. She felt herself\nesteemed, needed almost.\n\nAs they took coffee in the library, there was a soft, very soft\nknocking at the door. He started, and called \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome in.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The timbre of\nhis voice, like something vibrating at high pitch, unnerved Gudrun. A\nnurse in white entered, half hovering in the doorway like a shadow. She\nwas very good-looking, but strangely enough, shy and self-mistrusting.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe doctor would like to speak to you, Mr Crich,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her\nlow, discreet voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe doctor!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, starting up. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere is he?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is in the dining-room.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTell him I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m coming.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe drank up his coffee, and followed the nurse, who had dissolved like\na shadow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhich nurse was that?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMiss Inglis\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I like her best,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Winifred.\n\nAfter a while Gerald came back, looking absorbed by his own thoughts,\nand having some of that tension and abstraction which is seen in a\nslightly drunken man. He did not say what the doctor had wanted him\nfor, but stood before the fire, with his hands behind his back, and his\nface open and as if rapt. Not that he was really thinking\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was only\narrested in pure suspense inside himself, and thoughts wafted through\nhis mind without order.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI must go now and see Mama,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Winifred, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand see Dadda before he\ngoes to sleep.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe bade them both good-night.\n\nGudrun also rose to take her leave.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go yet, need you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, glancing quickly at the\nclock. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is early yet. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll walk down with you when you go. Sit down,\ndon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t hurry away.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun sat down, as if, absent as he was, his will had power over her.\nShe felt almost mesmerised. He was strange to her, something unknown.\nWhat was he thinking, what was he feeling, as he stood there so rapt,\nsaying nothing? He kept her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she could feel that. He would not let her\ngo.

She looked down at her hands.\n\nThen there was the sound of the door softly opening. Gerald started. He\nwas chagrined. It was his starting that really startled Gudrun.

Her bulk\nseemed hunched in the chair, her fair hair hung slack over her ears.\nBut her skin was clear and fine, her hands, as she sat with them\nforgotten and folded, were quite beautiful, full of potential energy. A\ngreat mass of energy seemed decaying up in that silent, hulking form.\n\nShe looked up at her son, as he stood, keen and soldierly, near to her.\nHer eyes were most wonderfully blue, bluer than forget-me-nots. She\nseemed to have a certain confidence in Gerald, and to feel a certain\nmotherly mistrust of him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow are _you?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she muttered, in her strangely quiet voice, as if\nnobody should hear but him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not getting into a state, are you?\n\nYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not letting it make you hysterical?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe curious challenge in the last words startled Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think so, mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered, rather coldly cheery.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSomebody\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s got to see it through, you know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave they?

At the door she lifted her face to him,\nimplicitly. He kissed her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come any further with me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her barely audible\nvoice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want you any further.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe bade her good-night, watched her across to the stairs and mount\nslowly. Then he closed the door and came back to Gudrun. Gudrun rose\nalso, to go.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA queer being, my mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe has her own thoughts.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nThen they were silent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou want to go?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHalf a minute, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll just have a horse put\nin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI want to walk.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe had promised to walk with her down the long, lonely mile of drive,\nand she wanted this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou might _just_ as well drive,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d _much rather_ walk,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asserted, with emphasis.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou would! Then I will come along with you. You know where your things\nare? I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll put boots on.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe put on a cap, and an overcoat over his evening dress. They went out\ninto the night.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet us light a cigarette,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, stopping in a sheltered angle of\nthe porch. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou have one too.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSo, with the scent of tobacco on the night air, they set off down the\ndark drive that ran between close-cut hedges through sloping meadows.\n\nHe wanted to put his arm round her. If he could put his arm round her,\nand draw her against him as they walked, he would equilibriate himself.\nFor now he felt like a pair of scales, the half of which tips down and\ndown into an indefinite void. He must recover some sort of balance. And\nhere was the hope and the perfect recovery.\n\nBlind to her, thinking only of himself, he slipped his arm softly round\nher waist, and drew her to him. Her heart fainted, feeling herself\ntaken. But then, his arm was so strong, she quailed under its powerful\nclose grasp. She died a little death, and was drawn against him as they\nwalked down the stormy darkness. He seemed to balance her perfectly in\nopposition to himself, in their dual motion of walking. So, suddenly,\nhe was liberated and perfect, strong, heroic.\n\nHe put his hand to his mouth and threw his cigarette away, a gleaming\npoint, into the unseen hedge. Then he was quite free to balance her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s better,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, with exultancy.\n\nThe exultation in his voice was like a sweetish, poisonous drug to her.\nDid she then mean so much to him! She sipped the poison.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you happier?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, wistfully.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMuch better,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in the same exultant voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand I was rather\nfar gone.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe nestled against him. He felt her all soft and warm, she was the\nrich, lovely substance of his being. The warmth and motion of her walk\nsuffused through him wonderfully.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m _so_ glad if I help you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nobody else could do it, if you wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is true,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself, with a thrill of strange, fatal\nelation.\n\nAs they walked, he seemed to lift her nearer and nearer to himself,\ntill she moved upon the firm vehicle of his body.\n\nHe was so strong, so sustaining, and he could not be opposed. She\ndrifted along in a wonderful interfusion of physical motion, down the\ndark, blowy hillside. Far across shone the little yellow lights of\nBeldover, many of them, spread in a thick patch on another dark hill.\nBut he and she were walking in perfect, isolated darkness, outside the\nworld.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how much do you care for me!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came her voice, almost querulous.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou see, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t understand!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow much!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d His voice rang with a painful elation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know\neither\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but everything.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He was startled by his own declaration. It was\ntrue. So he stripped himself of every safeguard, in making this\nadmission to her. He cared everything for her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she was everything.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said her low voice, amazed, trembling. She\nwas trembling with doubt and exultance. This was the thing she wanted\nto hear, only this. Yet now she heard it, heard the strange clapping\nvibration of truth in his voice as he said it, she could not believe.\nShe could not believe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she did not believe. Yet she believed,\ntriumphantly, with fatal exultance.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy not?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you believe it?

And it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t my own presence I care about, it is all yours. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d\nsell my soul a hundred times\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear not to have you here.\nI couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear to be alone. My brain would burst. It is true.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He drew\nher closer to him, with definite movement.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she murmured, afraid. Yet this was what she wanted. Why did she\nso lose courage?\n\nThey resumed their strange walk. They were such strangers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and yet they\nwere so frightfully, unthinkably near. It was like a madness. Yet it\nwas what she wanted, it was what she wanted. They had descended the\nhill, and now they were coming to the square arch where the road passed\nunder the colliery railway. The arch, Gudrun knew, had walls of squared\nstone, mossy on one side with water that trickled down, dry on the\nother side. She had stood under it to hear the train rumble thundering\nover the logs overhead. And she knew that under this dark and lonely\nbridge the young colliers stood in the darkness with their sweethearts,\nin rainy weather. And so she wanted to stand under the bridge with\n_her_ sweetheart, and be kissed under the bridge in the invisible\ndarkness. Her steps dragged as she drew near.\n\nSo, under the bridge, they came to a standstill, and he lifted her upon\nhis breast. His body vibrated taut and powerful as he closed upon her\nand crushed her, breathless and dazed and destroyed, crushed her upon\nhis breast. Ah, it was terrible, and perfect. Under this bridge, the\ncolliers pressed their lovers to their breast. And now, under the\nbridge, the master of them all pressed her to himself! And how much\nmore powerful and terrible was his embrace than theirs, how much more\nconcentrated and supreme his love was, than theirs in the same sort!\nShe felt she would swoon, die, under the vibrating, inhuman tension of\nhis arms and his body\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she would pass away. Then the unthinkable high\nvibration slackened and became more undulating. He slackened and drew\nher with him to stand with his back to the wall.\n\nShe was almost unconscious. So the colliers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 lovers would stand with\ntheir backs to the walls, holding their sweethearts and kissing them as\nshe was being kissed. Ah, but would their kisses be fine and powerful\nas the kisses of the firm-mouthed master? Even the keen, short-cut\nmoustache\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the colliers would not have that.\n\nAnd the colliers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 sweethearts would, like herself, hang their heads\nback limp over their shoulder, and look out from the dark archway, at\nthe close patch of yellow lights on the unseen hill in the distance, or\nat the vague form of trees, and at the buildings of the colliery\nwood-yard, in the other direction.\n\nHis arms were fast around her, he seemed to be gathering her into\nhimself, her warmth, her softness, her adorable weight, drinking in the\nsuffusion of her physical being, avidly. He lifted her, and seemed to\npour her into himself, like wine into a cup.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis is worth everything,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a strange, penetrating voice.\n\nSo she relaxed, and seemed to melt, to flow into him, as if she were\nsome infinitely warm and precious suffusion filling into his veins,\nlike an intoxicant. Her arms were round his neck, he kissed her and\nheld her perfectly suspended, she was all slack and flowing into him,\nand he was the firm, strong cup that receives the wine of her life. So\nshe lay cast upon him, stranded, lifted up against him, melting and\nmelting under his kisses, melting into his limbs and bones, as if he\nwere soft iron becoming surcharged with her electric life.\n\nTill she seemed to swoon, gradually her mind went, and she passed away,\neverything in her was melted down and fluid, and she lay still, become\ncontained by him, sleeping in him as lightning sleeps in a pure, soft\nstone. So she was passed away and gone in him, and he was perfected.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes again, and saw the patch of lights in the\ndistance, it seemed to her strange that the world still existed, that\nshe was standing under the bridge resting her head on Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s breast.\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094who was he? He was the exquisite adventure, the desirable\nunknown to her.\n\nShe looked up, and in the darkness saw his face above her, his shapely,\nmale face. There seemed a faint, white light emitted from him, a white\naura, as if he were visitor from the unseen. She reached up, like Eve\nreaching to the apples on the tree of knowledge, and she kissed him,\nthough her passion was a transcendent fear of the thing he was,\ntouching his face with her infinitely delicate, encroaching wondering\nfingers. Her fingers went over the mould of his face, over his\nfeatures. How perfect and foreign he was\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ah how dangerous! Her soul\nthrilled with complete knowledge. This was the glistening, forbidden\napple, this face of a man. She kissed him, putting her fingers over his\nface, his eyes, his nostrils, over his brows and his ears, to his neck,\nto know him, to gather him in by touch. He was so firm, and shapely,\nwith such satisfying, inconceivable shapeliness, strange, yet\nunutterably clear. He was such an unutterable enemy, yet glistening\nwith uncanny white fire. She wanted to touch him and touch him and\ntouch him, till she had him all in her hands, till she had strained him\ninto her knowledge. Ah, if she could have the precious _knowledge_ of\nhim, she would be filled, and nothing could deprive her of this. For he\nwas so unsure, so risky in the common world of day.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are so _beautiful_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she murmured in her throat.\n\nHe wondered, and was suspended. But she felt him quiver, and she came\ndown involuntarily nearer upon him. He could not help himself. Her\nfingers had him under their power. The fathomless, fathomless desire\nthey could evoke in him was deeper than death, where he had no choice.\n\nBut she knew now, and it was enough. For the time, her soul was\ndestroyed with the exquisite shock of his invisible fluid lightning.\nShe knew. And this knowledge was a death from which she must recover.\nHow much more of him was there to know? Ah much, much, many days\nharvesting for her large, yet perfectly subtle and intelligent hands\nupon the field of his living, radio-active body. Ah, her hands were\neager, greedy for knowledge. But for the present it was enough, enough,\nas much as her soul could bear. Too much, and she would shatter\nherself, she would fill the fine vial of her soul too quickly, and it\nwould break. Enough now\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094enough for the time being. There were all the\nafter days when her hands, like birds, could feed upon the fields of\nhim mystical plastic form\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094till then enough.\n\nAnd even he was glad to be checked, rebuked, held back. For to desire\nis better than to possess, the finality of the end was dreaded as\ndeeply as it was desired.\n\nThey walked on towards the town, towards where the lamps threaded\nsingly, at long intervals down the dark high-road of the valley. They\ncame at length to the gate of the drive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come any further,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d rather I didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, relieved. He did not want to go up\nthe public streets with her, his soul all naked and alight as it was.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMuch rather\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094good-night.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She held out her hand. He grasped it, then\ntouched the perilous, potent fingers with his lips.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-night,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTomorrow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd they parted. He went home full of the strength and the power of\nliving desire.\n\nBut the next day, she did not come, she sent a note that she was kept\nindoors by a cold. Here was a torment! But he possessed his soul in\nsome sort of patience, writing a brief answer, telling her how sorry he\nwas not to see her.\n\nThe day after this, he stayed at home\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it seemed so futile to go down to\nthe office. His father could not live the week out. And he wanted to be\nat home, suspended.\n\nGerald sat on a chair by the window in his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s room. The landscape\noutside was black and winter-sodden. His father lay grey and ashen on\nthe bed, a nurse moved silently in her white dress, neat and elegant,\neven beautiful. There was a scent of eau-de-Cologne in the room. The\nnurse went out of the room, Gerald was alone with death, facing the\nwinter-black landscape.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs there much more water in Denley?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the faint voice, determined\nand querulous, from the bed. The dying man was asking about a leakage\nfrom Willey Water into one of the pits.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSome more\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we shall have to run off the lake,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d The faint voice filtered to extinction. There was dead\nstillness. The grey-faced, sick man lay with eyes closed, more dead\nthan death. Gerald looked away. He felt his heart was seared, it would\nperish if this went on much longer.\n\nSuddenly he heard a strange noise. Turning round, he saw his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\neyes wide open, strained and rolling in a frenzy of inhuman struggling.\nGerald started to his feet, and stood transfixed in horror.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWha-a-ah-h-h\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came a horrible choking rattle from his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nthroat, the fearful, frenzied eye, rolling awfully in its wild\nfruitless search for help, passed blindly over Gerald, then up came the\ndark blood and mess pumping over the face of the agonised being. The\ntense body relaxed, the head fell aside, down the pillow.\n\nGerald stood transfixed, his soul echoing in horror. He would move, but\nhe could not. He could not move his limbs. His brain seemed to re-echo,\nlike a pulse.\n\nThe nurse in white softly entered. She glanced at Gerald, then at the\nbed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came her soft whimpering cry, and she hurried forward to the dead\nman. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh-h!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the slight sound of her agitated distress, as she\nstood bending over the bedside. Then she recovered, turned, and came\nfor towel and sponge. She was wiping the dead face carefully, and\nmurmuring, almost whimpering, very softly: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPoor Mr Crich!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Poor Mr\nCrich! Poor Mr Crich!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs he dead?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d clanged Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sharp voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes, he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gone,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the soft, moaning voice of the nurse, as\nshe looked up at Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face. She was young and beautiful and\nquivering. A strange sort of grin went over Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, over the\nhorror. And he walked out of the room.\n\nHe was going to tell his mother. On the landing he met his brother\nBasil.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gone, Basil,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, scarcely able to subdue his voice, not to\nlet an unconscious, frightening exultation sound through.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Basil, going pale.\n\nGerald nodded. Then he went on to his mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s room.\n\nShe was sitting in her purple gown, sewing, very slowly sewing, putting\nin a stitch then another stitch. She looked up at Gerald with her blue\nundaunted eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFather\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gone,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dead? Who says so?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, you know, mother, if you see him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe put her sewing down, and slowly rose.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you going to see him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said\n\nBy the bedside the children already stood in a weeping group.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, mother!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the daughters, almost in hysterics, weeping loudly.\n\nBut the mother went forward. The dead man lay in repose, as if gently\nasleep, so gently, so peacefully, like a young man sleeping in purity.\nHe was still warm. She stood looking at him in gloomy, heavy silence,\nfor some time.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said bitterly, at length, speaking as if to the unseen\nwitnesses of the air. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re dead.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She stood for some minutes in\nsilence, looking down. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBeautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asserted, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cbeautiful as if life\nhad never touched you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094never touched you. God send I look different. I\nhope I shall look my years, when I am dead. Beautiful, beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she\ncrooned over him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou can see him in his teens, with his first beard\non his face. A beautiful soul, beautiful\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Then there was a tearing in\nher voice as she cried: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNone of you look like this, when you are dead!\nDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t let it happen again.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d It was a strange, wild command from out of\nthe unknown. Her children moved unconsciously together, in a nearer\ngroup, at the dreadful command in her voice. The colour was flushed\nbright in her cheek, she looked awful and wonderful. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBlame me, blame\nme if you like, that he lies there like a lad in his teens, with his\nfirst beard on his face. Blame me if you like. But you none of you\nknow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She was silent in intense silence.\n\nThen there came, in a low, tense voice: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf I thought that the children\nI bore would lie looking like that in death, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d strangle them when\nthey were infants, yes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, mother,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came the strange, clarion voice of Gerald from the\nbackground, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe are different, we don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t blame you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe turned and looked full in his eyes. Then she lifted her hands in a\nstrange half-gesture of mad despair.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPray!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said strongly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPray for yourselves to God, for there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s no\nhelp for you from your parents.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh mother!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried her daughters wildly.\n\nBut she had turned and gone, and they all went quickly away from each\nother.\n\nWhen Gudrun heard that Mr Crich was dead, she felt rebuked. She had\nstayed away lest Gerald should think her too easy of winning. And now,\nhe was in the midst of trouble, whilst she was cold.\n\nThe following day she went up as usual to Winifred, who was glad to see\nher, glad to get away into the studio. The girl had wept, and then, too\nfrightened, had turned aside to avoid any more tragic eventuality. She\nand Gudrun resumed work as usual, in the isolation of the studio, and\nthis seemed an immeasurable happiness, a pure world of freedom, after\nthe aimlessness and misery of the house. Gudrun stayed on till evening.\nShe and Winifred had dinner brought up to the studio, where they ate in\nfreedom, away from all the people in the house.\n\nAfter dinner Gerald came up. The great high studio was full of shadow\nand a fragrance of coffee. Gudrun and Winifred had a little table near\nthe fire at the far end, with a white lamp whose light did not travel\nfar. They were a tiny world to themselves, the two girls surrounded by\nlovely shadows, the beams and rafters shadowy over-head, the benches\nand implements shadowy down the studio.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are cosy enough here,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, going up to them.\n\nThere was a low brick fireplace, full of fire, an old blue Turkish rug,\nthe little oak table with the lamp and the white-and-blue cloth and the\ndessert, and Gudrun making coffee in an odd brass coffee-maker, and\nWinifred scalding a little milk in a tiny saucepan.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you had coffee?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have, but I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll have some more with you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen you must have it in a glass\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there are only two cups,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nWinifred.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is the same to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, taking a chair and coming into the\ncharmed circle of the girls. How happy they were, how cosy and\nglamorous it was with them, in a world of lofty shadows! The outside\nworld, in which he had been transacting funeral business all the day\nwas completely wiped out. In an instant he snuffed glamour and magic.\n\nThey had all their things very dainty, two odd and lovely little cups,\nscarlet and solid gilt, and a little black jug with scarlet discs, and\nthe curious coffee-machine, whose spirit-flame flowed steadily, almost\ninvisibly. There was the effect of rather sinister richness, in which\nGerald at once escaped himself.\n\nThey all sat down, and Gudrun carefully poured out the coffee.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you have milk?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked calmly, yet nervously poising the\nlittle black jug with its big red dots. She was always so completely\ncontrolled, yet so bitterly nervous.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nSo, with a curious humility, she placed him the little cup of coffee,\nand herself took the awkward tumbler. She seemed to want to serve him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you give me the glass\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is so clumsy for you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. He\nwould much rather have had it, and seen her daintily served. But she\nwas silent, pleased with the disparity, with her self-abasement.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are quite _en m\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9nage_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes. We aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t really at home to visitors,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Winifred.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not? Then I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m an intruder?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nFor once he felt his conventional dress was out of place, he was an\noutsider.\n\nGudrun was very quiet. She did not feel drawn to talk to him. At this\nstage, silence was best\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or mere light words. It was best to leave\nserious things aside. So they talked gaily and lightly, till they heard\nthe man below lead out the horse, and call it to \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cback-back!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d into the\ndog-cart that was to take Gudrun home. So she put on her things, and\nshook hands with Gerald, without once meeting his eyes. And she was\ngone.\n\nThe funeral was detestable. Afterwards, at the tea-table, the daughters\nkept saying\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe was a good father to us\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the best father in the\nworld\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or else\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t easily find another man as good as father\nwas.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald acquiesced in all this. It was the right conventional attitude,\nand, as far as the world went, he believed in the conventions. He took\nit as a matter of course. But Winifred hated everything, and hid in the\nstudio, and cried her heart out, and wished Gudrun would come.\n\nLuckily everybody was going away. The Criches never stayed long at\nhome. By dinner-time, Gerald was left quite alone. Even Winifred was\ncarried off to London, for a few days with her sister Laura.\n\nBut when Gerald was really left alone, he could not bear it. One day\npassed by, and another. And all the time he was like a man hung in\nchains over the edge of an abyss. Struggle as he might, he could not\nturn himself to the solid earth, he could not get footing. He was\nsuspended on the edge of a void, writhing. Whatever he thought of, was\nthe abyss\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094whether it were friends or strangers, or work or play, it all\nshowed him only the same bottomless void, in which his heart swung\nperishing. There was no escape, there was nothing to grasp hold of. He\nmust writhe on the edge of the chasm, suspended in chains of invisible\nphysical life.\n\nAt first he was quiet, he kept still, expecting the extremity to pass\naway, expecting to find himself released into the world of the living,\nafter this extremity of penance. But it did not pass, and a crisis\ngained upon him.\n\nAs the evening of the third day came on, his heart rang with fear. He\ncould not bear another night. Another night was coming on, for another\nnight he was to be suspended in chain of physical life, over the\nbottomless pit of nothingness. And he could not bear it. He could not\nbear it. He was frightened deeply, and coldly, frightened in his soul.\nHe did not believe in his own strength any more. He could not fall into\nthis infinite void, and rise again. If he fell, he would be gone for\never. He must withdraw, he must seek reinforcements. He did not believe\nin his own single self, any further than this.\n\nAfter dinner, faced with the ultimate experience of his own\nnothingness, he turned aside. He pulled on his boots, put on his coat,\nand set out to walk in the night.\n\nIt was dark and misty. He went through the wood, stumbling and feeling\nhis way to the Mill. Birkin was away. Good\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was half glad. He turned\nup the hill, and stumbled blindly over the wild slopes, having lost the\npath in the complete darkness. It was boring. Where was he going? No\nmatter. He stumbled on till he came to a path again. Then he went on\nthrough another wood. His mind became dark, he went on automatically.\nWithout thought or sensation, he stumbled unevenly on, out into the\nopen again, fumbling for stiles, losing the path, and going along the\nhedges of the fields till he came to the outlet.\n\nAnd at last he came to the high road. It had distracted him to struggle\nblindly through the maze of darkness. But now, he must take a\ndirection. And he did not even know where he was. But he must take a\ndirection now. Nothing would be resolved by merely walking, walking\naway. He had to take a direction.\n\nHe stood still on the road, that was high in the utterly dark night,\nand he did not know where he was. It was a strange sensation, his heart\nbeating, and ringed round with the utterly unknown darkness. So he\nstood for some time.\n\nThen he heard footsteps, and saw a small, swinging light. He\nimmediately went towards this. It was a miner.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan you tell me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhere this road goes?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRoad? Ay, it goes ter Whatmore.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhatmore! Oh thank you, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s right. I thought I was wrong.\nGood-night.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-night,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the broad voice of the miner.\n\nGerald guessed where he was. At least, when he came to Whatmore, he\nwould know. He was glad to be on a high road. He walked forward as in a\nsleep of decision.\n\nThat was Whatmore Village\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094? Yes, the King\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Head\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and there the hall\ngates. He descended the steep hill almost running. Winding through the\nhollow, he passed the Grammar School, and came to Willey Green Church.\nThe churchyard! He halted.\n\nThen in another moment he had clambered up the wall and was going among\nthe graves. Even in this darkness he could see the heaped pallor of old\nwhite flowers at his feet. This then was the grave. He stooped down.\nThe flowers were cold and clammy. There was a raw scent of\nchrysanthemums and tube-roses, deadened. He felt the clay beneath, and\nshrank, it was so horribly cold and sticky. He stood away in revulsion.\n\nHere was one centre then, here in the complete darkness beside the\nunseen, raw grave. But there was nothing for him here. No, he had\nnothing to stay here for. He felt as if some of the clay were sticking\ncold and unclean, on his heart. No, enough of this.\n\nWhere then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094home? Never! It was no use going there. That was less than\nno use. It could not be done. There was somewhere else to go. Where?\n\nA dangerous resolve formed in his heart, like a fixed idea. There was\nGudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she would be safe in her home. But he could get at her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he would\nget at her. He would not go back tonight till he had come to her, if it\ncost him his life. He staked his all on this throw.\n\nHe set off walking straight across the fields towards Beldover. It was\nso dark, nobody could ever see him. His feet were wet and cold, heavy\nwith clay. But he went on persistently, like a wind, straight forward,\nas if to his fate. There were great gaps in his consciousness. He was\nconscious that he was at Winthorpe hamlet, but quite unconscious how he\nhad got there. And then, as in a dream, he was in the long street of\nBeldover, with its street-lamps.\n\nThere was a noise of voices, and of a door shutting loudly, and being\nbarred, and of men talking in the night. The \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLord Nelson\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d had just\nclosed, and the drinkers were going home. He had better ask one of\nthese where she lived\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094for he did not know the side streets at all.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan you tell me where Somerset Drive is?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked of one of the\nuneven men.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere what?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the tipsy miner\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSomerset Drive.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSomerset Drive!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve heard o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 such a place, but I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t for my life\nsay where it is.

He slowed down, as he neared his goal, not knowing how he\nshould proceed. What if the house were closed in darkness?\n\nBut it was not. He saw a big lighted window, and heard voices, then a\ngate banged. His quick ears caught the sound of Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice, his\nkeen eyes made out Birkin, with Ursula standing in a pale dress on the\nstep of the garden path. Then Ursula stepped down, and came along the\nroad, holding Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s arm.\n\nGerald went across into the darkness and they dawdled past him, talking\nhappily, Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice low, Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s high and distinct. Gerald went\nquickly to the house.\n\nThe blinds were drawn before the big, lighted window of the\ndining-room. Looking up the path at the side he could see the door left\nopen, shedding a soft, coloured light from the hall lamp. He went\nquickly and silently up the path, and looked up into the hall. There\nwere pictures on the walls, and the antlers of a stag\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and the stairs\ngoing up on one side\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and just near the foot of the stairs the half\nopened door of the dining-room.\n\nWith heart drawn fine, Gerald stepped into the hall, whose floor was of\ncoloured tiles, went quickly and looked into the large, pleasant room.\nIn a chair by the fire, the father sat asleep, his head tilted back\nagainst the side of the big oak chimney piece, his ruddy face seen\nforeshortened, the nostrils open, the mouth fallen a little. It would\ntake the merest sound to wake him.\n\nGerald stood a second suspended. He glanced down the passage behind\nhim. It was all dark. Again he was suspended. Then he went swiftly\nupstairs. His senses were so finely, almost supernaturally keen, that\nhe seemed to cast his own will over the half-unconscious house.\n\nHe came to the first landing. There he stood, scarcely breathing.\nAgain, corresponding to the door below, there was a door again. That\nwould be the mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s room. He could hear her moving about in the\ncandlelight. She would be expecting her husband to come up. He looked\nalong the dark landing.\n\nThen, silently, on infinitely careful feet, he went along the passage,\nfeeling the wall with the extreme tips of his fingers. There was a\ndoor. He stood and listened. He could hear two people\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s breathing. It\nwas not that. He went stealthily forward. There was another door,\nslightly open. The room was in darkness. Empty. Then there was the\nbathroom, he could smell the soap and the heat. Then at the end another\nbedroom\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094one soft breathing. This was she.\n\nWith an almost occult carefulness he turned the door handle, and opened\nthe door an inch. It creaked slightly. Then he opened it another\ninch\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then another. His heart did not beat, he seemed to create a\nsilence about himself, an obliviousness.\n\nHe was in the room. Still the sleeper breathed softly. It was very\ndark. He felt his way forward inch by inch, with his feet and hands. He\ntouched the bed, he could hear the sleeper. He drew nearer, bending\nclose as if his eyes would disclose whatever there was. And then, very\nnear to his face, to his fear, he saw the round, dark head of a boy.\n\nHe recovered, turned round, saw the door ajar, a faint light revealed.\nAnd he retreated swiftly, drew the door to without fastening it, and\npassed rapidly down the passage. At the head of the stairs he\nhesitated. There was still time to flee.\n\nBut it was unthinkable. He would maintain his will. He turned past the\ndoor of the parental bedroom like a shadow, and was climbing the second\nflight of stairs. They creaked under his weight\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was exasperating. Ah\nwhat disaster, if the mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s door opened just beneath him, and she\nsaw him! It would have to be, if it were so. He held the control still.\n\nHe was not quite up these stairs when he heard a quick running of feet\nbelow, the outer door was closed and locked, he heard Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice,\nthen the father\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sleepy exclamation. He pressed on swiftly to the\nupper landing.\n\nAgain a door was ajar, a room was empty. Feeling his way forward, with\nthe tips of his fingers, travelling rapidly, like a blind man, anxious\nlest Ursula should come upstairs, he found another door. There, with\nhis preternaturally fine sense alert, he listened. He heard someone\nmoving in bed. This would be she.\n\nSoftly now, like one who has only one sense, the tactile sense, he\nturned the latch. It clicked. He held still. The bed-clothes rustled.\nHis heart did not beat. Then again he drew the latch back, and very\ngently pushed the door. It made a sticking noise as it gave.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice, frightened. He quickly opened the door\nand pushed it behind him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs it you, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s frightened voice. He heard her\nsitting up in bed. In another moment she would scream.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, feeling his way towards her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is I, Gerald.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe sat motionless in her bed in sheer astonishment. She was too\nastonished, too much taken by surprise, even to be afraid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she echoed, in blank amazement. He had found his way to the\nbed, and his outstretched hand touched her warm breast blindly. She\nshrank away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet me make a light,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, springing out.\n\nHe stood perfectly motionless. He heard her touch the match-box, he\nheard her fingers in their movement. Then he saw her in the light of a\nmatch, which she held to the candle. The light rose in the room, then\nsank to a small dimness, as the flame sank down on the candle, before\nit mounted again.\n\nShe looked at him, as he stood near the other side of the bed. His cap\nwas pulled low over his brow, his black overcoat was buttoned close up\nto his chin. His face was strange and luminous. He was inevitable as a\nsupernatural being. When she had seen him, she knew. She knew there was\nsomething fatal in the situation, and she must accept it. Yet she must\nchallenge him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow did you come up?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI walked up the stairs\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the door was open.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t closed this door, either,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. She walked swiftly\nacross the room, and closed her door, softly, and locked it. Then she\ncame back.\n\nShe was wonderful, with startled eyes and flushed cheeks, and her plait\nof hair rather short and thick down her back, and her long, fine white\nnight-dress falling to her feet.\n\nShe saw that his boots were all clayey, even his trousers were\nplastered with clay. And she wondered if he had made footprints all the\nway up. He was a very strange figure, standing in her bedroom, near the\ntossed bed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy have you come?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, almost querulous.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wanted to,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nAnd this she could see from his face. It was fate.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are so muddy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in distaste, but gently.\n\nHe looked down at his feet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI was walking in the dark,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. But he felt vividly elated.\nThere was a pause. He stood on one side of the tumbled bed, she on the\nother. He did not even take his cap from his brows.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd what do you want of me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she challenged.\n\nHe looked aside, and did not answer. Save for the extreme beauty and\nmystic attractiveness of this distinct, strange face, she would have\nsent him away. But his face was too wonderful and undiscovered to her.\nIt fascinated her with the fascination of pure beauty, cast a spell on\nher, like nostalgia, an ache.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you want of me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated in an estranged voice.\n\nHe pulled off his cap, in a movement of dream-liberation, and went\nacross to her. But he could not touch her, because she stood barefoot\nin her night-dress, and he was muddy and damp. Her eyes, wide and large\nand wondering, watched him, and asked him the ultimate question.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI came\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094because I must,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do you ask?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him in doubt and wonder.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI must ask,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe shook his head slightly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is no answer,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, with strange vacancy.\n\nThere was about him a curious, and almost godlike air of simplicity and\nnative directness. He reminded her of an apparition, the young Hermes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why did you come to me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she persisted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it has to be so. If there weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you in the world, then _I_\nshouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be in the world, either.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe stood looking at him, with large, wide, wondering, stricken eyes.\nHis eyes were looking steadily into hers all the time, and he seemed\nfixed in an odd supernatural steadfastness. She sighed. She was lost\nnow. She had no choice.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you take off your boots,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey must be wet.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe dropped his cap on a chair, unbuttoned his overcoat, lifting up his\nchin to unfasten the throat buttons. His short, keen hair was ruffled.\nHe was so beautifully blond, like wheat. He pulled off his overcoat.\n\nQuickly he pulled off his jacket, pulled loose his black tie, and was\nunfastening his studs, which were headed each with a pearl. She\nlistened, watching, hoping no one would hear the starched linen\ncrackle. It seemed to snap like pistol shots.\n\nHe had come for vindication. She let him hold her in his arms, clasp\nher close against him. He found in her an infinite relief. Into her he\npoured all his pent-up darkness and corrosive death, and he was whole\nagain. It was wonderful, marvellous, it was a miracle. This was the\never-recurrent miracle of his life, at the knowledge of which he was\nlost in an ecstasy of relief and wonder. And she, subject, received him\nas a vessel filled with his bitter potion of death. She had no power at\nthis crisis to resist. The terrible frictional violence of death filled\nher, and she received it in an ecstasy of subjection, in throes of\nacute, violent sensation.\n\nAs he drew nearer to her, he plunged deeper into her enveloping soft\nwarmth, a wonderful creative heat that penetrated his veins and gave\nhim life again. He felt himself dissolving and sinking to rest in the\nbath of her living strength. It seemed as if her heart in her breast\nwere a second unconquerable sun, into the glow and creative strength of\nwhich he plunged further and further. All his veins, that were murdered\nand lacerated, healed softly as life came pulsing in, stealing\ninvisibly in to him as if it were the all-powerful effluence of the\nsun. His blood, which seemed to have been drawn back into death, came\nebbing on the return, surely, beautifully, powerfully.\n\nHe felt his limbs growing fuller and flexible with life, his body\ngained an unknown strength. He was a man again, strong and rounded. And\nhe was a child, so soothed and restored and full of gratitude.\n\nAnd she, she was the great bath of life, he worshipped her. Mother and\nsubstance of all life she was. And he, child and man, received of her\nand was made whole. His pure body was almost killed. But the\nmiraculous, soft effluence of her breast suffused over him, over his\nseared, damaged brain, like a healing lymph, like a soft, soothing flow\nof life itself, perfect as if he were bathed in the womb again.\n\nHis brain was hurt, seared, the tissue was as if destroyed. He had not\nknown how hurt he was, how his tissue, the very tissue of his brain was\ndamaged by the corrosive flood of death. Now, as the healing lymph of\nher effluence flowed through him, he knew how destroyed he was, like a\nplant whose tissue is burst from inwards by a frost.\n\nHe buried his small, hard head between her breasts, and pressed her\nbreasts against him with his hands. And she with quivering hands\npressed his head against her, as he lay suffused out, and she lay fully\nconscious. The lovely creative warmth flooded through him like a sleep\nof fecundity within the womb. Ah, if only she would grant him the flow\nof this living effluence, he would be restored, he would be complete\nagain. He was afraid she would deny him before it was finished. Like a\nchild at the breast, he cleaved intensely to her, and she could not put\nhim away. And his seared, ruined membrane relaxed, softened, that which\nwas seared and stiff and blasted yielded again, became soft and\nflexible, palpitating with new life. He was infinitely grateful, as to\nGod, or as an infant is at its mother\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s breast. He was glad and\ngrateful like a delirium, as he felt his own wholeness come over him\nagain, as he felt the full, unutterable sleep coming over him, the\nsleep of complete exhaustion and restoration.\n\nBut Gudrun lay wide awake, destroyed into perfect consciousness. She\nlay motionless, with wide eyes staring motionless into the darkness,\nwhilst he was sunk away in sleep, his arms round her.\n\nShe seemed to be hearing waves break on a hidden shore, long, slow,\ngloomy waves, breaking with the rhythm of fate, so monotonously that it\nseemed eternal. This endless breaking of slow, sullen waves of fate\nheld her life a possession, whilst she lay with dark, wide eyes looking\ninto the darkness. She could see so far, as far as eternity\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094yet she saw\nnothing. She was suspended in perfect consciousness\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and of what was she\nconscious?\n\nThis mood of extremity, when she lay staring into eternity, utterly\nsuspended, and conscious of everything, to the last limits, passed and\nleft her uneasy. She had lain so long motionless. She moved, she became\nself-conscious. She wanted to look at him, to see him.\n\nBut she dared not make a light, because she knew he would wake, and she\ndid not want to break his perfect sleep, that she knew he had got of\nher.\n\nShe disengaged herself, softly, and rose up a little to look at him.\nThere was a faint light, it seemed to her, in the room. She could just\ndistinguish his features, as he slept the perfect sleep. In this\ndarkness, she seemed to see him so distinctly. But he was far off, in\nanother world. Ah, she could shriek with torment, he was so far off,\nand perfected, in another world. She seemed to look at him as at a\npebble far away under clear dark water. And here was she, left with all\nthe anguish of consciousness, whilst he was sunk deep into the other\nelement of mindless, remote, living shadow-gleam. He was beautiful,\nfar-off, and perfected. They would never be together. Ah, this awful,\ninhuman distance which would always be interposed between her and the\nother being!\n\nThere was nothing to do but to lie still and endure. She felt an\noverwhelming tenderness for him, and a dark, under-stirring of jealous\nhatred, that he should lie so perfect and immune, in an other-world,\nwhilst she was tormented with violent wakefulness, cast out in the\nouter darkness.\n\nShe lay in intense and vivid consciousness, an exhausting\nsuperconsciousness. The church clock struck the hours, it seemed to\nher, in quick succession. She heard them distinctly in the tension of\nher vivid consciousness. And he slept as if time were one moment,\nunchanging and unmoving.\n\nShe was exhausted, wearied. Yet she must continue in this state of\nviolent active superconsciousness. She was conscious of everything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094her\nchildhood, her girlhood, all the forgotten incidents, all the\nunrealised influences and all the happenings she had not understood,\npertaining to herself, to her family, to her friends, her lovers, her\nacquaintances, everybody. It was as if she drew a glittering rope of\nknowledge out of the sea of darkness, drew and drew and drew it out of\nthe fathomless depths of the past, and still it did not come to an end,\nthere was no end to it, she must haul and haul at the rope of\nglittering consciousness, pull it out phosphorescent from the endless\ndepths of the unconsciousness, till she was weary, aching, exhausted,\nand fit to break, and yet she had not done.\n\nAh, if only she might wake him! She turned uneasily. When could she\nrouse him and send him away? When could she disturb him? And she\nrelapsed into her activity of automatic consciousness, that would never\nend.\n\nBut the time was drawing near when she could wake him. It was like a\nrelease. The clock had struck four, outside in the night. Thank God the\nnight had passed almost away. At five he must go, and she would be\nreleased. Then she could relax and fill her own place. Now she was\ndriven up against his perfect sleeping motion like a knife white-hot on\na grindstone. There was something monstrous about him, about his\njuxtaposition against her.\n\nThe last hour was the longest. And yet, at last it passed. Her heart\nleapt with relief\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094yes, there was the slow, strong stroke of the church\nclock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094at last, after this night of eternity. She waited to catch each\nslow, fatal reverberation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThree\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094four\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094five!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d There, it was finished. A\nweight rolled off her.\n\nShe raised herself, leaned over him tenderly, and kissed him. She was\nsad to wake him. After a few moments, she kissed him again. But he did\nnot stir. The darling, he was so deep in sleep! What a shame to take\nhim out of it. She let him lie a little longer. But he must go\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he must\nreally go.\n\nWith full over-tenderness she took his face between her hands, and\nkissed his eyes. The eyes opened, he remained motionless, looking at\nher. Her heart stood still. To hide her face from his dreadful opened\neyes, in the darkness, she bent down and kissed him, whispering:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou must go, my love.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut she was sick with terror, sick.\n\nHe put his arms round her. Her heart sank.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut you must go, my love. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s late.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat time is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nStrange, his man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice. She quivered. It was an intolerable\noppression to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPast five o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nBut he only closed his arms round her again. Her heart cried within her\nin torture. She disengaged herself firmly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou really must go,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot for a minute,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe lay still, nestling against him, but unyielding.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot for a minute,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he repeated, clasping her closer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, unyielding, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m afraid if you stay any longer.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a certain coldness in her voice that made him release her,\nand she broke away, rose and lit the candle. That then was the end.\n\nHe got up. He was warm and full of life and desire. Yet he felt a\nlittle bit ashamed, humiliated, putting on his clothes before her, in\nthe candle-light. For he felt revealed, exposed to her, at a time when\nshe was in some way against him. It was all very difficult to\nunderstand. He dressed himself quickly, without collar or tie. Still he\nfelt full and complete, perfected. She thought it humiliating to see a\nman dressing: the ridiculous shirt, the ridiculous trousers and braces.\nBut again an idea saved her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is like a workman getting up to go to work,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d thought Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd I\nam like a workman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wife.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d But an ache like nausea was upon her: a\nnausea of him.\n\nHe pushed his collar and tie into his overcoat pocket. Then he sat down\nand pulled on his boots. They were sodden, as were his socks and\ntrouser-bottoms. But he himself was quick and warm.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps you ought to have put your boots on downstairs,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nAt once, without answering, he pulled them off again, and stood holding\nthem in his hand. She had thrust her feet into slippers, and flung a\nloose robe round her. She was ready. She looked at him as he stood\nwaiting, his black coat buttoned to the chin, his cap pulled down, his\nboots in his hand. And the passionate almost hateful fascination\nrevived in her for a moment. It was not exhausted. His face was so\nwarm-looking, wide-eyed and full of newness, so perfect. She felt old,\nold. She went to him heavily, to be kissed. He kissed her quickly. She\nwished his warm, expressionless beauty did not so fatally put a spell\non her, compel her and subjugate her. It was a burden upon her, that\nshe resented, but could not escape. Yet when she looked at his straight\nman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s brows, and at his rather small, well-shaped nose, and at his\nblue, indifferent eyes, she knew her passion for him was not yet\nsatisfied, perhaps never could be satisfied. Only now she was weary,\nwith an ache like nausea. She wanted him gone.\n\nThey went downstairs quickly. It seemed they made a prodigious noise.\nHe followed her as, wrapped in her vivid green wrap, she preceded him\nwith the light. She suffered badly with fear, lest her people should be\nroused. He hardly cared. He did not care now who knew. And she hated\nthis in him. One _must_ be cautious. One must preserve oneself.\n\nShe led the way to the kitchen. It was neat and tidy, as the woman had\nleft it. He looked up at the clock\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094twenty minutes past five Then he sat\ndown on a chair to put on his boots. She waited, watching his every\nmovement. She wanted it to be over, it was a great nervous strain on\nher.\n\nHe stood up\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she unbolted the back door, and looked out. A cold, raw\nnight, not yet dawn, with a piece of a moon in the vague sky. She was\nglad she need not go out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye then,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he murmured.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll come to the gate,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nAnd again she hurried on in front, to warn him of the steps. And at the\ngate, once more she stood on the step whilst he stood below her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood-bye,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered.\n\nHe kissed her dutifully, and turned away.\n\nShe suffered torments hearing his firm tread going so distinctly down\nthe road. Ah, the insensitiveness of that firm tread!\n\nShe closed the gate, and crept quickly and noiselessly back to bed.\nWhen she was in her room, and the door closed, and all safe, she\nbreathed freely, and a great weight fell off her. She nestled down in\nbed, in the groove his body had made, in the warmth he had left. And\nexcited, worn-out, yet still satisfied, she fell soon into a deep,\nheavy sleep.\n\nGerald walked quickly through the raw darkness of the coming dawn. He\nmet nobody. His mind was beautifully still and thoughtless, like a\nstill pool, and his body full and warm and rich. He went quickly along\ntowards Shortlands, in a grateful self-sufficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXV.\n\n\n MARRIAGE OR NOT\n\nThe Brangwen family was going to move from Beldover. It was necessary\nnow for the father to be in town.\n\nBirkin had taken out a marriage licence, yet Ursula deferred from day\nto day.

And he smiled as if triumphantly.\n\nHe was ready to be doomed. Marriage was like a doom to him. He was\nwilling to condemn himself in marriage, to become like a convict\ncondemned to the mines of the underworld, living no life in the sun,\nbut having a dreadful subterranean activity. He was willing to accept\nthis. And marriage was the seal of his condemnation. He was willing to\nbe sealed thus in the underworld, like a soul damned but living forever\nin damnation. But he would not make any pure relationship with any\nother soul. He could not. Marriage was not the committing of himself\ninto a relationship with Gudrun. It was a committing of himself in\nacceptance of the established world, he would accept the established\norder, in which he did not livingly believe, and then he would retreat\nto the underworld for his life. This he would do.\n\nThe other way was to accept Rupert\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s offer of alliance, to enter into\nthe bond of pure trust and love with the other man, and then\nsubsequently with the woman. If he pledged himself with the man he\nwould later be able to pledge himself with the woman: not merely in\nlegal marriage, but in absolute, mystic marriage.\n\nYet he could not accept the offer. There was a numbness upon him, a\nnumbness either of unborn, absent volition, or of atrophy. Perhaps it\nwas the absence of volition. For he was strangely elated at Rupert\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\noffer. Yet he was still more glad to reject it, not to be committed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n A CHAIR\n\nThere was a jumble market every Monday afternoon in the old\nmarket-place in town. Ursula and Birkin strayed down there one\nafternoon. They had been talking of furniture, and they wanted to see\nif there was any fragment they would like to buy, amid the heaps of\nrubbish collected on the cobble-stones.\n\nThe old market-square was not very large, a mere bare patch of granite\nsetts, usually with a few fruit-stalls under a wall. It was in a poor\nquarter of the town. Meagre houses stood down one side, there was a\nhosiery factory, a great blank with myriad oblong windows, at the end,\na street of little shops with flagstone pavement down the other side,\nand, for a crowning monument, the public baths, of new red brick, with\na clock-tower. The people who moved about seemed stumpy and sordid, the\nair seemed to smell rather dirty, there was a sense of many mean\nstreets ramifying off into warrens of meanness. Now and again a great\nchocolate-and-yellow tramcar ground round a difficult bend under the\nhosiery factory.\n\nUrsula was superficially thrilled when she found herself out among the\ncommon people, in the jumbled place piled with old bedding, heaps of\nold iron, shabby crockery in pale lots, muffled lots of unthinkable\nclothing. She and Birkin went unwillingly down the narrow aisle between\nthe rusty wares. He was looking at the goods, she at the people.\n\nShe excitedly watched a young woman, who was going to have a baby, and\nwho was turning over a mattress and making a young man, down-at-heel\nand dejected, feel it also. So secretive and active and anxious the\nyoung woman seemed, so reluctant, slinking, the young man. He was going\nto marry her because she was having a child.\n\nWhen they had felt the mattress, the young woman asked the old man\nseated on a stool among his wares, how much it was. He told her, and\nshe turned to the young man. The latter was ashamed, and selfconscious.\nHe turned his face away, though he left his body standing there, and\nmuttered aside. And again the woman anxiously and actively fingered the\nmattress and added up in her mind and bargained with the old, unclean\nman. All the while, the young man stood by, shamefaced and\ndown-at-heel, submitting.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthere is a pretty chair.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCharming!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, charming.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was an arm-chair of simple wood, probably birch, but of such fine\ndelicacy of grace, standing there on the sordid stones, it almost\nbrought tears to the eyes. It was square in shape, of the purest,\nslender lines, and four short lines of wood in the back, that reminded\nUrsula of harpstrings.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt was once,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cgilded\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and it had a cane seat. Somebody\nhas nailed this wooden seat in. Look, here is a trifle of the red that\nunderlay the gilt. The rest is all black, except where the wood is worn\npure and glossy. It is the fine unity of the lines that is so\nattractive. Look, how they run and meet and counteract. But of course\nthe wooden seat is wrong\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it destroys the perfect lightness and unity in\ntension the cane gave.

And the man curiously obliterated himself,\nas if he could make himself invisible, as a rat can.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe wanted to _give_ it to you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d explained Ursula, now overcome with\nconfusion and dread of them. She was attracted by the young man. He was\na still, mindless creature, hardly a man at all, a creature that the\ntowns have produced, strangely pure-bred and fine in one sense,\nfurtive, quick, subtle. His lashes were dark and long and fine over his\neyes, that had no mind in them, only a dreadful kind of subject, inward\nconsciousness, glazed and dark. His dark brows and all his lines, were\nfinely drawn. He would be a dreadful, but wonderful lover to a woman,\nso marvellously contributed. His legs would be marvellously subtle and\nalive, under the shapeless, trousers, he had some of the fineness and\nstillness and silkiness of a dark-eyed, silent rat.\n\nUrsula had apprehended him with a fine _frisson_ of attraction. The\nfull-built woman was staring offensively. Again Ursula forgot him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you have the chair?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nThe man looked at her with a sideways look of appreciation, yet\nfar-off, almost insolent. The woman drew herself up. There was a\ncertain costermonger richness about her. She did not know what Ursula\nwas after, she was on her guard, hostile. Birkin approached, smiling\nwickedly at seeing Ursula so nonplussed and frightened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the matter?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, smiling. His eyelids had dropped\nslightly, there was about him the same suggestive, mocking secrecy that\nwas in the bearing of the two city creatures. The man jerked his head a\nlittle on one side, indicating Ursula, and said, with curious amiable,\njeering warmth:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat she warnt?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094eh?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d An odd smile writhed his lips.\n\nBirkin looked at him from under his slack, ironical eyelids.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTo give you a chair\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094with the label on it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, pointing.\n\nThe man looked at the object indicated.

They appreciated each other. The\nyouth stood aside, his face expressionless and timeless, the thin line\nof the black moustache drawn strangely suggestive over his rather wide,\nclosed mouth.

She could feel his darkened steady eyes looking\nat her all the time. It made her a little bit frightened. She pushed\nher hair off her forehead nervously.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo I look ugly?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nAnd she blew her nose again.\n\nA small smile came round his eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cfortunately.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd he went across to her, and gathered her like a belonging in his\narms. She was so tenderly beautiful, he could not bear to see her, he\ncould only bear to hide her against himself. Now; washed all clean by\nher tears, she was new and frail like a flower just unfolded, a flower\nso new, so tender, so made perfect by inner light, that he could not\nbear to look at her, he must hide her against himself, cover his eyes\nagainst her. She had the perfect candour of creation, something\ntranslucent and simple, like a radiant, shining flower that moment\nunfolded in primal blessedness. She was so new, so wonder-clear, so\nundimmed. And he was so old, so steeped in heavy memories. Her soul was\nnew, undefined and glimmering with the unseen. And his soul was dark\nand gloomy, it had only one grain of living hope, like a grain of\nmustard seed. But this one living grain in him matched the perfect\nyouth in her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI love you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he whispered as he kissed her, and trembled with pure\nhope, like a man who is born again to a wonderful, lively hope far\nexceeding the bounds of death.\n\nShe could not know how much it meant to him, how much he meant by the\nfew words. Almost childish, she wanted proof, and statement, even\nover-statement, for everything seemed still uncertain, unfixed to her.\n\nBut the passion of gratitude with which he received her into his soul,\nthe extreme, unthinkable gladness of knowing himself living and fit to\nunite with her, he, who was so nearly dead, who was so near to being\ngone with the rest of his race down the slope of mechanical death,\ncould never be understood by her. He worshipped her as age worships\nyouth, he gloried in her, because, in his one grain of faith, he was\nyoung as she, he was her proper mate. This marriage with her was his\nresurrection and his life.\n\nAll this she could not know. She wanted to be made much of, to be\nadored. There were infinite distances of silence between them. How\ncould he tell her of the immanence of her beauty, that was not form, or\nweight, or colour, but something like a strange, golden light! How\ncould he know himself what her beauty lay in, for him. He said \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYour\nnose is beautiful, your chin is adorable.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d But it sounded like lies,\nand she was disappointed, hurt. Even when he said, whispering with\ntruth, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI love you, I love you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d it was not the real truth. It was\nsomething beyond love, such a gladness of having surpassed oneself, of\nhaving transcended the old existence. How could he say \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 when he was\nsomething new and unknown, not himself at all? This I, this old formula\nof the age, was a dead letter.\n\nIn the new, superfine bliss, a peace superseding knowledge, there was\nno I and you, there was only the third, unrealised wonder, the wonder\nof existing not as oneself, but in a consummation of my being and of\nher being in a new one, a new, paradisal unit regained from the\nduality. Nor can I say \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI love you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d when I have ceased to be, and you\nhave ceased to be: we are both caught up and transcended into a new\noneness where everything is silent, because there is nothing to answer,\nall is perfect and at one. Speech travels between the separate parts.\nBut in the perfect One there is perfect silence of bliss.\n\nThey were married by law on the next day, and she did as he bade her,\nshe wrote to her father and mother. Her mother replied, not her father.\n\nShe did not go back to school. She stayed with Birkin in his rooms, or\nat the Mill, moving with him as he moved. But she did not see anybody,\nsave Gudrun and Gerald. She was all strange and wondering as yet, but\nrelieved as by dawn.\n\nGerald sat talking to her one afternoon in the warm study down at the\nMill. Rupert had not yet come home.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are happy?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked her, with a smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery happy!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, shrinking a little in her brightness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, one can see it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan one?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula in surprise.\n\nHe looked up at her with a communicative smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes, plainly.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was pleased.

The removal had taken place, the family had\ngone. Gudrun had rooms in Willey Green.\n\nUrsula had not seen her parents since her marriage. She wept over the\nrupture, yet what was the good of making it up! Good or not good, she\ncould not go to them. So her things had been left behind and she and\nGudrun were to walk over for them, in the afternoon.\n\nIt was a wintry afternoon, with red in the sky, when they arrived at\nthe house. The windows were dark and blank, already the place was\nfrightening. A stark, void entrance-hall struck a chill to the hearts\nof the girls.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t believe I dare have come in alone,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt frightens\nme.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it amazing!

How I lived here a day without dying of\nterror, I cannot conceive!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey looked in the big dining-room. It was a good-sized room, but now a\ncell would have been lovelier. The large bay windows were naked, the\nfloor was stripped, and a border of dark polish went round the tract of\npale boarding.\n\nIn the faded wallpaper were dark patches where furniture had stood,\nwhere pictures had hung. The sense of walls, dry, thin, flimsy-seeming\nwalls, and a flimsy flooring, pale with its artificial black edges, was\nneutralising to the mind. Everything was null to the senses, there was\nenclosure without substance, for the walls were dry and papery. Where\nwere they standing, on earth, or suspended in some cardboard box? In\nthe hearth was burnt paper, and scraps of half-burnt paper.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cImagine that we passed our days here!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is too appalling.

Another piece of shut-in air; without\nweight or substance, only a sense of intolerable papery imprisonment in\nnothingness. The kitchen did look more substantial, because of the\nred-tiled floor and the stove, but it was cold and horrid.\n\nThe two girls tramped hollowly up the bare stairs. Every sound\nre-echoed under their hearts. They tramped down the bare corridor.\nAgainst the wall of Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bedroom were her things\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a trunk, a\nwork-basket, some books, loose coats, a hat-box, standing desolate in\nthe universal emptiness of the dusk.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA cheerful sight, aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t they?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, looking down at her\nforsaken possessions.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cVery cheerful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nThe two girls set to, carrying everything down to the front door. Again\nand again they made the hollow, re-echoing transit. The whole place\nseemed to resound about them with a noise of hollow, empty futility. In\nthe distance the empty, invisible rooms sent forth a vibration almost\nof obscenity. They almost fled with the last articles, into the\nout-of-door.\n\nBut it was cold. They were waiting for Birkin, who was coming with the\ncar.

It was getting dark. They carried the\nthings to the car. Gudrun locked the door of the empty house. Birkin\nhad lighted the lamps of the automobile. It all seemed very happy, as\nif they were setting out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you mind stopping at Coulsons.

The shops were just lighted, the last\nminers were passing home along the causeways, half-visible shadows in\ntheir grey pit-dirt, moving through the blue air. But their feet rang\nharshly in manifold sound, along the pavement.\n\nHow pleased Gudrun was to come out of the shop, and enter the car, and\nbe borne swiftly away into the downhill of palpable dusk, with Ursula\nand Birkin! What an adventure life seemed at this moment! How deeply,\nhow suddenly she envied Ursula! Life for her was so quick, and an open\ndoor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so reckless as if not only this world, but the world that was gone\nand the world to come were nothing to her. Ah, if she could be _just\nlike that_, it would be perfect.\n\nFor always, except in her moments of excitement, she felt a want within\nherself. She was unsure. She had felt that now, at last, in Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nstrong and violent love, she was living fully and finally. But when she\ncompared herself with Ursula, already her soul was jealous,\nunsatisfied. She was not satisfied\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she was never to be satisfied.\n\nWhat was she short of now? It was marriage\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was the wonderful\nstability of marriage. She did want it, let her say what she might. She\nhad been lying. The old idea of marriage was right even now\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094marriage\nand the home. Yet her mouth gave a little grimace at the words. She\nthought of Gerald and Shortlands\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094marriage and the home! Ah well, let it\nrest! He meant a great deal to her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094! Perhaps it was not in her to\nmarry. She was one of life\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s outcasts, one of the drifting lives that\nhave no root. No, no it could not be so. She suddenly conjured up a\nrosy room, with herself in a beautiful gown, and a handsome man in\nevening dress who held her in his arms in the firelight, and kissed\nher.

She turned away to her\ncottage gate, and they drove on. But immediately she stood to watch\nthem, as the car ran vague into the distance. And as she went up the\npath to her strange house, her heart was full of incomprehensible\nbitterness.\n\nIn her parlour was a long-case clock, and inserted into its dial was a\nruddy, round, slant-eyed, joyous-painted face, that wagged over with\nthe most ridiculous ogle when the clock ticked, and back again with the\nsame absurd glad-eye at the next tick. All the time the absurd smooth,\nbrown-ruddy face gave her an obtrusive \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cglad-eye.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She stood for\nminutes, watching it, till a sort of maddened disgust overcame her, and\nshe laughed at herself hollowly. And still it rocked, and gave her the\nglad-eye from one side, then from the other, from one side, then from\nthe other. Ah, how unhappy she was! In the midst of her most active\nhappiness, ah, how unhappy she was! She glanced at the table.\nGooseberry jam, and the same home-made cake with too much soda in it!\nStill, gooseberry jam was good, and one so rarely got it.\n\nAll the evening she wanted to go to the Mill. But she coldly refused to\nallow herself. She went the next afternoon instead. She was happy to\nfind Ursula alone. It was a lovely, intimate secluded atmosphere. They\ntalked endlessly and delightedly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you _fearfully_ happy here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nsaid Gudrun to her sister glancing at her own bright eyes in the\nmirror. She always envied, almost with resentment, the strange positive\nfullness that subsisted in the atmosphere around Ursula and Birkin.\n\nHow really beautifully this room is done,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said aloud. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis hard\nplaited matting\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what a lovely colour it is, the colour of cool light!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd it seemed to her perfect.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cUrsula,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said at length, in a voice of question and detachment,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdid you know that Gerald Crich had suggested our going away all\ntogether at Christmas?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s spoken to Rupert.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA deep flush dyed Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s cheek.

It was evident that, whilst she was almost mortified\nby Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s taking the liberty of making such a suggestion to Birkin,\nyet the idea itself attracted her strongly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a rather lovely simplicity about Gerald, I think,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nUrsula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cso defiant, somehow!

She had still to get over the\nfeeling of insult at the liberty taken with her freedom.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat did Rupert say\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094do you know?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe said it would be most awfully jolly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\nAgain Gudrun looked down, and was silent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think it would?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, tentatively.

Ursula looked\non, rather frightened, frightened most of all because she thought\nGudrun seemed rather common, really like a little _type_. But she had\nnot the courage quite to think this\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not right out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, stammering. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh no\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094not at all like that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094oh no!

Birkin and Ursula\nwere busy packing their few personal things, making them ready to be\nsent off, to whatever country and whatever place they might choose at\nlast. Gudrun was very much excited. She loved to be on the wing.\n\nShe and Gerald, being ready first, set off via London and Paris to\nInnsbruck, where they would meet Ursula and Birkin. In London they\nstayed one night. They went to the music-hall, and afterwards to the\nPompadour Caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9.\n\nGudrun hated the Caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9, yet she always went back to it, as did most of\nthe artists of her acquaintance. She loathed its atmosphere of petty\nvice and petty jealousy and petty art. Yet she always called in again,\nwhen she was in town. It was as if she _had_ to return to this small,\nslow, central whirlpool of disintegration and dissolution: just give it\na look.\n\nShe sat with Gerald drinking some sweetish liqueur, and staring with\nblack, sullen looks at the various groups of people at the tables. She\nwould greet nobody, but young men nodded to her frequently, with a kind\nof sneering familiarity. She cut them all. And it gave her pleasure to\nsit there, cheeks flushed, eyes black and sullen, seeing them all\nobjectively, as put away from her, like creatures in some menagerie of\napish degraded souls. God, what a foul crew they were! Her blood beat\nblack and thick in her veins with rage and loathing. Yet she must sit\nand watch, watch. One or two people came to speak to her. From every\nside of the Caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9, eyes turned half furtively, half jeeringly at her,\nmen looking over their shoulders, women under their hats.\n\nThe old crowd was there, Carlyon in his corner with his pupils and his\ngirl, Halliday and Libidnikov and the Pussum\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they were all there.\nGudrun watched Gerald.

Gerald watched them with the steady twinkle in his eyes.\nThey were urging the Pussum to something.\n\nShe at last rose. She was wearing a curious dress of dark silk splashed\nand spattered with different colours, a curious motley effect. She was\nthinner, her eyes were perhaps hotter, more disintegrated. Otherwise\nshe was just the same. Gerald watched her with the same steady twinkle\nin his eyes as she came across. She held out her thin brown hand to\nhim.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow are you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe shook hands with her, but remained seated, and let her stand near\nhim, against the table.

Her\neyes were flashing, her cheeks were flushed. The strange effect of\nBirkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s letter read aloud in a perfect clerical sing-song, clear and\nresonant, phrase by phrase, made the blood mount into her head as if\nshe were mad.\n\nShe rose, whilst Gerald was paying the bill, and walked over to\nHalliday\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s table.

It was\nsome moments before anybody realised what was happening.\n\nFrom Halliday\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s table came half articulate cries, then somebody booed,\nthen all the far end of the place began booing after Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nretreating form. She was fashionably dressed in blackish-green and\nsilver, her hat was brilliant green, like the sheen on an insect, but\nthe brim was soft dark green, a falling edge with fine silver, her coat\nwas dark green, lustrous, with a high collar of grey fur, and great fur\ncuffs, the edge of her dress showed silver and black velvet, her\nstockings and shoes were silver grey. She moved with slow, fashionable\nindifference to the door. The porter opened obsequiously for her, and,\nat her nod, hurried to the edge of the pavement and whistled for a\ntaxi. The two lights of a vehicle almost immediately curved round\ntowards her, like two eyes.\n\nGerald had followed in wonder, amid all the booing, not having caught\nher misdeed. He heard the Pussum\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo and get it back from her. I never heard of such a thing! Go and get\nit back from her.

Yet she was frozen\nwith overwrought feelings. Gerald followed her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve forgotten the man,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said cooly, with a slight nod of her\nhat. Gerald gave the porter a shilling. The man saluted. They were in\nmotion.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat was all the row about?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gerald, in wondering excitement.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI walked away with Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s letter,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, and he saw the crushed\npaper in her hand.\n\nHis eyes glittered with satisfaction.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSplendid!

They must go by the\nmorning train from Charing Cross. As they drew over the bridge, in the\ntrain, having glimpses of the river between the great iron girders, she\ncried:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI feel I could _never_ see this foul town again\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _bear_ to\ncome back to it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\n CONTINENTAL\n\nUrsula went on in an unreal suspense, the last weeks before going away.\nShe was not herself,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she was not anything. She was something that is\ngoing to be\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094soon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094soon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094very soon. But as yet, she was only imminent.\n\nShe went to see her parents. It was a rather stiff, sad meeting, more\nlike a verification of separateness than a reunion. But they were all\nvague and indefinite with one another, stiffened in the fate that moved\nthem apart.\n\nShe did not really come to until she was on the ship crossing from\nDover to Ostend. Dimly she had come down to London with Birkin, London\nhad been a vagueness, so had the train-journey to Dover. It was all\nlike a sleep.\n\nAnd now, at last, as she stood in the stern of the ship, in a\npitch-dark, rather blowy night, feeling the motion of the sea, and\nwatching the small, rather desolate little lights that twinkled on the\nshores of England, as on the shores of nowhere, watched them sinking\nsmaller and smaller on the profound and living darkness, she felt her\nsoul stirring to awake from its an\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6sthetic sleep.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLet us go forward, shall we?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. He wanted to be at the tip\nof their projection. So they left off looking at the faint sparks that\nglimmered out of nowhere, in the far distance, called England, and\nturned their faces to the unfathomed night in front.\n\nThey went right to the bows of the softly plunging vessel. In the\ncomplete obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where\na great rope was coiled up. It was quite near the very point of the\nship, near the black, unpierced space ahead. There they sat down,\nfolded together, folded round with the same rug, creeping in nearer and\never nearer to one another, till it seemed they had crept right into\neach other, and become one substance. It was very cold, and the\ndarkness was palpable.\n\nOne of the ship\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s crew came along the deck, dark as the darkness, not\nreally visible. They then made out the faintest pallor of his face. He\nfelt their presence, and stopped, unsure\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then bent forward. When his\nface was near them, he saw the faint pallor of their faces. Then he\nwithdrew like a phantom. And they watched him without making any sound.\n\nThey seemed to fall away into the profound darkness. There was no sky,\nno earth, only one unbroken darkness, into which, with a soft, sleeping\nmotion, they seemed to fall like one closed seed of life falling\nthrough dark, fathomless space.\n\nThey had forgotten where they were, forgotten all that was and all that\nhad been, conscious only in their heart, and there conscious only of\nthis pure trajectory through the surpassing darkness. The ship\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s prow\ncleaved on, with a faint noise of cleavage, into the complete night,\nwithout knowing, without seeing, only surging on.\n\nIn Ursula the sense of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over\neverything. In the midst of this profound darkness, there seemed to\nglow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised.\nHer heart was full of the most wonderful light, golden like honey of\ndarkness, sweet like the warmth of day, a light which was not shed on\nthe world, only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going, a\nsweetness of habitation, a delight of living quite unknown, but hers\ninfallibly. In her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him, and\nhe touched it with his lips. So cold, so fresh, so sea-clear her face\nwas, it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf.\n\nBut he did not know the ecstasy of bliss in fore-knowledge that she\nknew. To him, the wonder of this transit was overwhelming. He was\nfalling through a gulf of infinite darkness, like a meteorite plunging\nacross the chasm between the worlds. The world was torn in two, and he\nwas plunging like an unlit star through the ineffable rift. What was\nbeyond was not yet for him. He was overcome by the trajectory.\n\nIn a trance he lay enfolding Ursula round about. His face was against\nher fine, fragile hair, he breathed its fragrance with the sea and the\nprofound night. And his soul was at peace; yielded, as he fell into the\nunknown. This was the first time that an utter and absolute peace had\nentered his heart, now, in this final transit out of life.\n\nWhen there came some stir on the deck, they roused. They stood up. How\nstiff and cramped they were, in the night-time! And yet the paradisal\nglow on her heart, and the unutterable peace of darkness in his, this\nwas the all-in-all.\n\nThey stood up and looked ahead. Low lights were seen down the darkness.\nThis was the world again. It was not the bliss of her heart, nor the\npeace of his. It was the superficial unreal world of fact. Yet not\nquite the old world. For the peace and the bliss in their hearts was\nenduring.\n\nStrange, and desolate above all things, like disembarking from the Styx\ninto the desolated underworld, was this landing at night. There was the\nraw, half-lighted, covered-in vastness of the dark place, boarded and\nhollow underfoot, with only desolation everywhere. Ursula had caught\nsight of the big, pallid, mystic letters \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOSTEND,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d standing in the\ndarkness. Everybody was hurrying with a blind, insect-like intentness\nthrough the dark grey air, porters were calling in un-English English,\nthen trotting with heavy bags, their colourless blouses looking ghostly\nas they disappeared; Ursula stood at a long, low, zinc-covered barrier,\nalong with hundreds of other spectral people, and all the way down the\nvast, raw darkness was this low stretch of open bags and spectral\npeople, whilst, on the other side of the barrier, pallid officials in\npeaked caps and moustaches were turning the underclothing in the bags,\nthen scrawling a chalk-mark.\n\nIt was done. Birkin snapped the hand bags, off they went, the porter\ncoming behind. They were through a great doorway, and in the open night\nagain\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ah, a railway platform! Voices were still calling in inhuman\nagitation through the dark-grey air, spectres were running along the\ndarkness between the train.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cK\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6ln\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Berlin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula made out on the boards hung on the high train on\none side.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHere we are,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.

They followed. The compartments were already some of them taken.\nBut many were dim and empty. The luggage was stowed, the porter was\ntipped.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Nous avons encore\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin, looking at his watch and at the\nporter.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Encore une demi-heure._\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d With which, in his blue blouse, he\ndisappeared. He was ugly and insolent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCome,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is cold. Let us eat.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a coffee-wagon on the platform. They drank hot, watery\ncoffee, and ate the long rolls, split, with ham between, which were\nsuch a wide bite that it almost dislocated Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s jaw; and they\nwalked beside the high trains. It was all so strange, so extremely\ndesolate, like the underworld, grey, grey, dirt grey, desolate,\nforlorn, nowhere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094grey, dreary nowhere.\n\nAt last they were moving through the night. In the darkness Ursula made\nout the flat fields, the wet flat dreary darkness of the Continent.\nThey pulled up surprisingly soon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Bruges! Then on through the level\ndarkness, with glimpses of sleeping farms and thin poplar trees and\ndeserted high-roads. She sat dismayed, hand in hand with Birkin. He\npale, immobile like a _revenant_ himself, looked sometimes out of the\nwindow, sometimes closed his eyes. Then his eyes opened again, dark as\nthe darkness outside.\n\nA flash of a few lights on the darkness\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Ghent station! A few more\nspectres moving outside on the platform\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then the bell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then motion again\nthrough the level darkness. Ursula saw a man with a lantern come out of\na farm by the railway, and cross to the dark farm-buildings. She\nthought of the Marsh, the old, intimate farm-life at Cossethay. My God,\nhow far was she projected from her childhood, how far was she still to\ngo! In one life-time one travelled through \u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a6ons. The great chasm of\nmemory from her childhood in the intimate country surroundings of\nCossethay and the Marsh Farm\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she remembered the servant Tilly, who used\nto give her bread and butter sprinkled with brown sugar, in the old\nliving-room where the grandfather clock had two pink roses in a basket\npainted above the figures on the face\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and now when she was travelling\ninto the unknown with Birkin, an utter stranger\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094was so great, that it\nseemed she had no identity, that the child she had been, playing in\nCossethay churchyard, was a little creature of history, not really\nherself.\n\nThey were at Brussels\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094half an hour for breakfast. They got down. On the\ngreat station clock it said six o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock. They had coffee and rolls and\nhoney in the vast desert refreshment room, so dreary, always so dreary,\ndirty, so spacious, such desolation of space. But she washed her face\nand hands in hot water, and combed her hair\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that was a blessing.\n\nSoon they were in the train again and moving on. The greyness of dawn\nbegan. There were several people in the compartment, large florid\nBelgian business-men with long brown beards, talking incessantly in an\nugly French she was too tired to follow.\n\nIt seemed the train ran by degrees out of the darkness into a faint\nlight, then beat after beat into the day. Ah, how weary it was!\nFaintly, the trees showed, like shadows. Then a house, white, had a\ncurious distinctness. How was it? Then she saw a village\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there were\nalways houses passing.\n\nThis was an old world she was still journeying through, winter-heavy\nand dreary. There was plough-land and pasture, and copses of bare\ntrees, copses of bushes, and homesteads naked and work-bare. No new\nearth had come to pass.\n\nShe looked at Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face. It was white and still and eternal, too\neternal. She linked her fingers imploringly in his, under the cover of\nher rug. His fingers responded, his eyes looked back at her. How dark,\nlike a night, his eyes were, like another world beyond! Oh, if he were\nthe world as well, if only the world were he! If only he could call a\nworld into being, that should be their own world!\n\nThe Belgians left, the train ran on, through Luxembourg, through\nAlsace-Lorraine, through Metz. But she was blind, she could see no\nmore. Her soul did not look out.\n\nThey came at last to Basle, to the hotel. It was all a drifting trance,\nfrom which she never came to. They went out in the morning, before the\ntrain departed. She saw the street, the river, she stood on the bridge.\nBut it all meant nothing. She remembered some shops\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094one full of\npictures, one with orange velvet and ermine. But what did these\nsignify?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094nothing.\n\nShe was not at ease till they were in the train again. Then she was\nrelieved. So long as they were moving onwards, she was satisfied. They\ncame to Z\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bcrich, then, before very long, ran under the mountains, that\nwere deep in snow. At last she was drawing near. This was the other\nworld now.\n\nInnsbruck was wonderful, deep in snow, and evening. They drove in an\nopen sledge over the snow: the train had been so hot and stifling. And\nthe hotel, with the golden light glowing under the porch, seemed like a\nhome.\n\nThey laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall. The place seemed\nfull and busy.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you know if Mr and Mrs Crich\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094English\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094from Paris, have arrived?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nBirkin asked in German.\n\nThe porter reflected a moment, and was just going to answer, when\nUrsula caught sight of Gudrun sauntering down the stairs, wearing her\ndark glossy coat, with grey fur.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGudrun! Gudrun!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she called, waving up the well of the staircase.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShu-hu!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun looked over the rail, and immediately lost her sauntering,\ndiffident air. Her eyes flashed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Ursula!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. And she began to move downstairs as Ursula\nran up. They met at a turn and kissed with laughter and exclamations\ninarticulate and stirring.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, mortified. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe thought it was _tomorrow_ you were\ncoming!

You look almost perfectly fresh. I like that fur cap\n_immensely!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She glanced over Ursula, who wore a big soft coat with a\ncollar of deep, soft, blond fur, and a soft blond cap of fur.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you think _you_ look like!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun assumed an unconcerned, expressionless face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you like it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s _very_ fine!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula, perhaps with a touch of satire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo up\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or come down,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin. For there the sisters stood, Gudrun\nwith her hand on Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s arm, on the turn of the stairs half way to\nthe first landing, blocking the way and affording full entertainment to\nthe whole of the hall below, from the door porter to the plump Jew in\nblack clothes.\n\nThe two young women slowly mounted, followed by Birkin and the waiter.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFirst floor?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun, looking back over her shoulder.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSecond Madam\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the lift!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d the waiter replied. And he darted to the\nelevator to forestall the two women. But they ignored him, as,\nchattering without heed, they set to mount the second flight. Rather\nchagrined, the waiter followed.\n\nIt was curious, the delight of the sisters in each other, at this\nmeeting. It was as if they met in exile, and united their solitary\nforces against all the world. Birkin looked on with some mistrust and\nwonder.\n\nWhen they had bathed and changed, Gerald came in. He looked shining\nlike the sun on frost.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo with Gerald and smoke,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula to Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGudrun and I want\nto talk.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThen the sisters sat in Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bedroom, and talked clothes, and\nexperiences. Gudrun told Ursula the experience of the Birkin letter in\nthe caf\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9. Ursula was shocked and frightened.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere is the letter?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI kept it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll give it me, won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nBut Gudrun was silent for some moments, before she replied:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you really want it, Ursula?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI want to read it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCertainly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun.\n\nEven now, she could not admit, to Ursula, that she wanted to keep it,\nas a memento, or a symbol. But Ursula knew, and was not pleased. So the\nsubject was switched off.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat did you do in Paris?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun laconically\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthe usual things. We had a _fine_ party\none night in Fanny Bath\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s studio.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid you? And you and Gerald were there! Who else? Tell me about it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s nothing particular to tell. You know\nFanny is _frightfully_ in love with that painter, Billy Macfarlane. He\nwas there\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so Fanny spared nothing, she spent _very_ freely. It was\nreally remarkable! Of course, everybody got fearfully drunk\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but in an\ninteresting way, not like that filthy London crowd. The fact is these\nwere all people that matter, which makes all the difference. There was\na Roumanian, a fine chap. He got completely drunk, and climbed to the\ntop of a high studio ladder, and gave the most marvellous\naddress\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094really, Ursula, it was wonderful!

It was snow\neverywhere, a white, perfect cradle of snow, new and frozen, sweeping\nup on either side, black crags, and white sweeps of silver towards the\nblue pale heavens.\n\nAs they stepped out on the naked platform, with only snow around and\nabove, Gudrun shrank as if it chilled her heart.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy God, Jerry,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, turning to Gerald with sudden intimacy,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve done it now.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe made a faint gesture, indicating the world on either hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook at it!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe seemed afraid to go on. He laughed.\n\nThey were in the heart of the mountains. From high above, on either\nside, swept down the white fold of snow, so that one seemed small and\ntiny in a valley of pure concrete heaven, all strangely radiant and\nchangeless and silent.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt makes one feel so small and alone,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, turning to Birkin\nand laying her hand on his arm.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not sorry you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve come, are you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald to Gudrun.\n\nShe looked doubtful. They went out of the station between banks of\nsnow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, sniffing the air in elation, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthis is perfect.\nThere\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s our sledge. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll walk a bit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll run up the road.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun, always doubtful, dropped her heavy coat on the sledge, as he\ndid his, and they set off. Suddenly she threw up her head and set off\nscudding along the road of snow, pulling her cap down over her ears.\nHer blue, bright dress fluttered in the wind, her thick scarlet\nstockings were brilliant above the whiteness. Gerald watched her: she\nseemed to be rushing towards her fate, and leaving him behind. He let\nher get some distance, then, loosening his limbs, he went after her.\n\nEverywhere was deep and silent snow. Great snow-eaves weighed down the\nbroad-roofed Tyrolese houses, that were sunk to the window-sashes in\nsnow. Peasant-women, full-skirted, wearing each a cross-over shawl, and\nthick snow-boots, turned in the way to look at the soft, determined\ngirl running with such heavy fleetness from the man, who was overtaking\nher, but not gaining any power over her.\n\nThey passed the inn with its painted shutters and balcony, a few\ncottages, half buried in the snow; then the snow-buried silent sawmill\nby the roofed bridge, which crossed the hidden stream, over which they\nran into the very depth of the untouched sheets of snow. It was a\nsilence and a sheer whiteness exhilarating to madness. But the perfect\nsilence was most terrifying, isolating the soul, surrounding the heart\nwith frozen air.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a marvellous place, for all that,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, looking into his\neyes with a strange, meaning look. His soul leapt.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nA fierce electric energy seemed to flow over all his limbs, his muscles\nwere surcharged, his hands felt hard with strength. They walked along\nrapidly up the snow-road, that was marked by withered branches of trees\nstuck in at intervals. He and she were separate, like opposite poles of\none fierce energy. But they felt powerful enough to leap over the\nconfines of life into the forbidden places, and back again.\n\nBirkin and Ursula were running along also, over the snow. He had\ndisposed of the luggage, and they had a little start of the sledges.\nUrsula was excited and happy, but she kept turning suddenly to catch\nhold of Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s arm, to make sure of him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThis is something I never expected,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is a different\nworld, here.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThey went on into a snow meadow. There they were overtaken by the\nsledge, that came tinkling through the silence. It was another mile\nbefore they came upon Gudrun and Gerald on the steep up-climb, beside\nthe pink, half-buried shrine.\n\nThen they passed into a gulley, where were walls of black rock and a\nriver filled with snow, and a still blue sky above. Through a covered\nbridge they went, drumming roughly over the boards, crossing the\nsnow-bed once more, then slowly up and up, the horses walking swiftly,\nthe driver cracking his long whip as he walked beside, and calling his\nstrange wild _hue-hue!_, the walls of rock passing slowly by, till they\nemerged again between slopes and masses of snow. Up and up, gradually\nthey went, through the cold shadow-radiance of the afternoon, silenced\nby the imminence of the mountains, the luminous, dazing sides of snow\nthat rose above them and fell away beneath.\n\nThey came forth at last in a little high table-land of snow, where\nstood the last peaks of snow like the heart petals of an open rose. In\nthe midst of the last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely\nbuilding with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof, deep and\ndeserted in the waste of snow, like a dream. It stood like a rock that\nhad rolled down from the last steep slopes, a rock that had taken the\nform of a house, and was now half-buried. It was unbelievable that one\ncould live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and\nsilence and clear, upper, ringing cold.\n\nYet the sledges ran up in fine style, people came to the door laughing\nand excited, the floor of the hostel rang hollow, the passage was wet\nwith snow, it was a real, warm interior.\n\nThe newcomers tramped up the bare wooden stairs, following the serving\nwoman. Gudrun and Gerald took the first bedroom. In a moment they found\nthemselves alone in a bare, smallish, close-shut room that was all of\ngolden-coloured wood, floor, walls, ceiling, door, all of the same warm\ngold panelling of oiled pine. There was a window opposite the door, but\nlow down, because the roof sloped. Under the slope of the ceiling were\nthe table with wash-hand bowl and jug, and across, another table with\nmirror. On either side the door were two beds piled high with an\nenormous blue-checked overbolster, enormous.\n\nThis was all\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094no cupboard, none of the amenities of life. Here they were\nshut up together in this cell of golden-coloured wood, with two blue\nchecked beds. They looked at each other and laughed, frightened by this\nnaked nearness of isolation.\n\nA man knocked and came in with the luggage. He was a sturdy fellow with\nflattish cheek-bones, rather pale, and with coarse fair moustache.\nGudrun watched him put down the bags, in silence, then tramp heavily\nout.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t too rough, is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald asked.\n\nThe bedroom was not very warm, and she shivered slightly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is wonderful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she equivocated. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook at the colour of this\npanelling\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wonderful, like being inside a nut.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe was standing watching her, feeling his short-cut moustache, leaning\nback slightly and watching her with his keen, undaunted eyes, dominated\nby the constant passion, that was like a doom upon him.\n\nShe went and crouched down in front of the window, curious.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, but this\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried involuntarily, almost in pain.\n\nIn front was a valley shut in under the sky, the last huge slopes of\nsnow and black rock, and at the end, like the navel of the earth, a\nwhite-folded wall, and two peaks glimmering in the late light. Straight\nin front ran the cradle of silent snow, between the great slopes that\nwere fringed with a little roughness of pine-trees, like hair, round\nthe base. But the cradle of snow ran on to the eternal closing-in,\nwhere the walls of snow and rock rose impenetrable, and the mountain\npeaks above were in heaven immediate. This was the centre, the knot,\nthe navel of the world, where the earth belonged to the skies, pure,\nunapproachable, impassable.\n\nIt filled Gudrun with a strange rapture. She crouched in front of the\nwindow, clenching her face in her hands, in a sort of trance. At last\nshe had arrived, she had reached her place. Here at last she folded her\nventure and settled down like a crystal in the navel of snow, and was\ngone.\n\nGerald bent above her and was looking out over her shoulder. Already he\nfelt he was alone. She was gone. She was completely gone, and there was\nicy vapour round his heart. He saw the blind valley, the great\ncul-de-sac of snow and mountain peaks, under the heaven. And there was\nno way out. The terrible silence and cold and the glamorous whiteness\nof the dusk wrapped him round, and she remained crouching before the\nwindow, as at a shrine, a shadow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you like it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, in a voice that sounded detached and\nforeign. At least she might acknowledge he was with her. But she only\naverted her soft, mute face a little from his gaze. And he knew that\nthere were tears in her eyes, her own tears, tears of her strange\nreligion, that put him to nought.\n\nQuite suddenly, he put his hand under her chin and lifted up her face\nto him. Her dark blue eyes, in their wetness of tears, dilated as if\nshe was startled in her very soul. They looked at him through their\ntears in terror and a little horror. His light blue eyes were keen,\nsmall-pupilled and unnatural in their vision. Her lips parted, as she\nbreathed with difficulty.\n\nThe passion came up in him, stroke after stroke, like the ringing of a\nbronze bell, so strong and unflawed and indomitable. His knees\ntightened to bronze as he hung above her soft face, whose lips parted\nand whose eyes dilated in a strange violation. In the grasp of his hand\nher chin was unutterably soft and silken. He felt strong as winter, his\nhands were living metal, invincible and not to be turned aside. His\nheart rang like a bell clanging inside him.\n\nHe took her up in his arms. She was soft and inert, motionless. All the\nwhile her eyes, in which the tears had not yet dried, were dilated as\nif in a kind of swoon of fascination and helplessness. He was\nsuperhumanly strong, and unflawed, as if invested with supernatural\nforce.\n\nHe lifted her close and folded her against him. Her softness, her\ninert, relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged, bronze-like limbs\nin a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him, if he were not\nfulfilled. She moved convulsively, recoiling away from him. His heart\nwent up like a flame of ice, he closed over her like steel. He would\ndestroy her rather than be denied.\n\nBut the overweening power of his body was too much for her. She relaxed\nagain, and lay loose and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to\nhim, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would\nhave suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second\nof this pang of unsurpassable bliss.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy God,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to her, his face drawn and strange, transfigured,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat next?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe lay perfectly still, with a still, child-like face and dark eyes,\nlooking at him. She was lost, fallen right away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall always love you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, looking at her.\n\nBut she did not hear. She lay, looking at him as at something she could\nnever understand, never: as a child looks at a grown-up person, without\nhope of understanding, only submitting.\n\nHe kissed her, kissed her eyes shut, so that she could not look any\nmore. He wanted something now, some recognition, some sign, some\nadmission. But she only lay silent and child-like and remote, like a\nchild that is overcome and cannot understand, only feels lost. He\nkissed her again, giving up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we go down and have coffee and _Kuchen?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\nThe twilight was falling slate-blue at the window. She closed her eyes,\nclosed away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them again\nto the every-day world.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said briefly, regaining her will with a click. She went\nagain to the window. Blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow\nand over the great pallid slopes. But in the heaven the peaks of snow\nwere rosy, glistening like transcendent, radiant spikes of blossom in\nthe heavenly upper-world, so lovely and beyond.\n\nGudrun saw all their loveliness, she _knew_ how immortally beautiful\nthey were, great pistils of rose-coloured, snow-fed fire in the blue\ntwilight of the heaven. She could _see_ it, she knew it, but she was\nnot of it. She was divorced, debarred, a soul shut out.\n\nWith a last look of remorse, she turned away, and was doing her hair.\nHe had unstrapped the luggage, and was waiting, watching her. She knew\nhe was watching her. It made her a little hasty and feverish in her\nprecipitation.\n\nThey went downstairs, both with a strange other-world look on their\nfaces, and with a glow in their eyes. They saw Birkin and Ursula\nsitting at the long table in a corner, waiting for them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow good and simple they look together,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun thought, jealously.\nShe envied them some spontaneity, a childish sufficiency to which she\nherself could never approach. They seemed such children to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSuch good _Kranzkuchen!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula greedily. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSo good!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRight,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan we have _Kaffee mit Kranzkuchen?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she added\nto the waiter.\n\nAnd she seated herself on the bench beside Gerald. Birkin, looking at\nthem, felt a pain of tenderness for them.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI think the place is really wonderful, Gerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_prachtvoll_\nand _wunderbar_ and _wundersch\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6n_ and _unbeschreiblich_ and all the\nother German adjectives.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald broke into a slight smile.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_I_ like it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nThe tables, of white scrubbed wood, were placed round three sides of\nthe room, as in a Gasthaus. Birkin and Ursula sat with their backs to\nthe wall, which was of oiled wood, and Gerald and Gudrun sat in the\ncorner next them, near to the stove. It was a fairly large place, with\na tiny bar, just like a country inn, but quite simple and bare, and all\nof oiled wood, ceilings and walls and floor, the only furniture being\nthe tables and benches going round three sides, the great green stove,\nand the bar and the doors on the fourth side. The windows were double,\nand quite uncurtained. It was early evening.\n\nThe coffee came\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094hot and good\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and a whole ring of cake.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA whole _Kuchen!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey give you more than us! I want\nsome of yours.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere were other people in the place, ten altogether, so Birkin had\nfound out: two artists, three students, a man and wife, and a Professor\nand two daughters\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094all Germans. The four English people, being\nnewcomers, sat in their coign of vantage to watch. The Germans peeped\nin at the door, called a word to the waiter, and went away again. It\nwas not meal-time, so they did not come into this dining-room, but\nbetook themselves, when their boots were changed, to the _Reunionsaal._\n\nThe English visitors could hear the occasional twanging of a zither,\nthe strumming of a piano, snatches of laughter and shouting and\nsinging, a faint vibration of voices. The whole building being of wood,\nit seemed to carry every sound, like a drum, but instead of increasing\neach particular noise, it decreased it, so that the sound of the zither\nseemed tiny, as if a diminutive zither were playing somewhere, and it\nseemed the piano must be a small one, like a little spinet.\n\nThe host came when the coffee was finished. He was a Tyrolese, broad,\nrather flat-cheeked, with a pale, pock-marked skin and flourishing\nmoustaches.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWould you like to go to the _Reunionsaal_ to be introduced to the\nother ladies and gentlemen?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, bending forward and smiling,\nshowing his large, strong teeth. His blue eyes went quickly from one to\nthe other\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was not quite sure of his ground with these English\npeople. He was unhappy too because he spoke no English and he was not\nsure whether to try his French.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall we go to the _Reunionsaal_, and be introduced to the other\npeople?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gerald, laughing.\n\nThere was a moment\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hesitation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI suppose we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d better\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094better break the ice,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nThe women rose, rather flushed. And the Wirt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s black, beetle-like,\nbroad-shouldered figure went on ignominiously in front, towards the\nnoise. He opened the door and ushered the four strangers into the\nplay-room.\n\nInstantly a silence fell, a slight embarrassment came over the company.\nThe newcomers had a sense of many blond faces looking their way. Then,\nthe host was bowing to a short, energetic-looking man with large\nmoustaches, and saying in a low voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Herr Professor, darf ich vorstellen_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe Herr Professor was prompt and energetic. He bowed low to the\nEnglish people, smiling, and began to be a comrade at once.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Nehmen die Herrschaften teil an unserer Unterhaltung?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, with\na vigorous suavity, his voice curling up in the question.\n\nThe four English people smiled, lounging with an attentive uneasiness\nin the middle of the room. Gerald, who was spokesman, said that they\nwould willingly take part in the entertainment. Gudrun and Ursula,\nlaughing, excited, felt the eyes of all the men upon them, and they\nlifted their heads and looked nowhere, and felt royal.\n\nThe Professor announced the names of those present, _sans c\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9r\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9monie_.\nThere was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people.\nEverybody was there, except the man and wife. The two tall,\nclear-skinned, athletic daughters of the professor, with their\nplain-cut, dark blue blouses and loden skirts, their rather long,\nstrong necks, their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair, and\ntheir blushes, bowed and stood back; the three students bowed very low,\nin the humble hope of making an impression of extreme good-breeding;\nthen there was a thin, dark-skinned man with full eyes, an odd\ncreature, like a child, and like a troll, quick, detached; he bowed\nslightly; his companion, a large fair young man, stylishly dressed,\nblushed to the eyes and bowed very low.\n\nIt was over.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHerr Loerke was giving us a recitation in the Cologne dialect,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said\nthe Professor.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe must forgive us for interrupting him,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe should like\nvery much to hear it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was instantly a bowing and an offering of seats. Gudrun and\nUrsula, Gerald and Birkin sat in the deep sofas against the wall. The\nroom was of naked oiled panelling, like the rest of the house. It had a\npiano, sofas and chairs, and a couple of tables with books and\nmagazines. In its complete absence of decoration, save for the big,\nblue stove, it was cosy and pleasant.\n\nHerr Loerke was the little man with the boyish figure, and the round,\nfull, sensitive-looking head, and the quick, full eyes, like a mouse\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s.\nHe glanced swiftly from one to the other of the strangers, and held\nhimself aloof.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPlease go on with the recitation,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Professor, suavely, with\nhis slight authority. Loerke, who was sitting hunched on the piano\nstool, blinked and did not answer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt would be a great pleasure,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, who had been getting the\nsentence ready, in German, for some minutes.\n\nThen, suddenly, the small, unresponding man swung aside, towards his\nprevious audience and broke forth, exactly as he had broken off; in a\ncontrolled, mocking voice, giving an imitation of a quarrel between an\nold Cologne woman and a railway guard.\n\nHis body was slight and unformed, like a boy\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, but his voice was\nmature, sardonic, its movement had the flexibility of essential energy,\nand of a mocking penetrating understanding. Gudrun could not understand\na word of his monologue, but she was spell-bound, watching him. He must\nbe an artist, nobody else could have such fine adjustment and\nsingleness. The Germans were doubled up with laughter, hearing his\nstrange droll words, his droll phrases of dialect. And in the midst of\ntheir paroxysms, they glanced with deference at the four English\nstrangers, the elect. Gudrun and Ursula were forced to laugh. The room\nrang with shouts of laughter. The blue eyes of the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ndaughters were swimming over with laughter-tears, their clear cheeks\nwere flushed crimson with mirth, their father broke out in the most\nastonishing peals of hilarity, the students bowed their heads on their\nknees in excess of joy. Ursula looked round amazed, the laughter was\nbubbling out of her involuntarily. She looked at Gudrun. Gudrun looked\nat her, and the two sisters burst out laughing, carried away. Loerke\nglanced at them swiftly, with his full eyes. Birkin was sniggering\ninvoluntarily. Gerald Crich sat erect, with a glistening look of\namusement on his face. And the laughter crashed out again, in wild\nparoxysms, the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s daughters were reduced to shaking\nhelplessness, the veins of the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s neck were swollen, his face\nwas purple, he was strangled in ultimate, silent spasms of laughter.\nThe students were shouting half-articulated words that tailed off in\nhelpless explosions. Then suddenly the rapid patter of the artist\nceased, there were little whoops of subsiding mirth, Ursula and Gudrun\nwere wiping their eyes, and the Professor was crying loudly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Das war ausgezeichnet, das war famos_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Wirklich famos_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d echoed his exhausted daughters, faintly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd we couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t understand it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Oh leider, leider!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the Professor.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t understand it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried the Students, let loose at last in\nspeech with the newcomers. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ja, das ist wirklich schade, das ist\nschade, gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau. Wissen Sie_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe mixture was made, the newcomers were stirred into the party, like\nnew ingredients, the whole room was alive. Gerald was in his element,\nhe talked freely and excitedly, his face glistened with a strange\namusement. Perhaps even Birkin, in the end, would break forth. He was\nshy and withheld, though full of attention.\n\nUrsula was prevailed upon to sing \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnnie Lowrie,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d as the Professor\ncalled it. There was a hush of _extreme_ deference. She had never been\nso flattered in her life. Gudrun accompanied her on the piano, playing\nfrom memory.\n\nUrsula had a beautiful ringing voice, but usually no confidence, she\nspoiled everything. This evening she felt conceited and untrammelled.\nBirkin was well in the background, she shone almost in reaction, the\nGermans made her feel fine and infallible, she was liberated into\noverweening self-confidence. She felt like a bird flying in the air, as\nher voice soared out, enjoying herself extremely in the balance and\nflight of the song, like the motion of a bird\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wings that is up in the\nwind, sliding and playing on the air, she played with sentimentality,\nsupported by rapturous attention. She was very happy, singing that song\nby herself, full of a conceit of emotion and power, working upon all\nthose people, and upon herself, exerting herself with gratification,\ngiving immeasurable gratification to the Germans.\n\nAt the end, the Germans were all touched with admiring, delicious\nmelancholy, they praised her in soft, reverent voices, they could not\nsay too much.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Wie sch\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6n, wie r\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bchrend! Ach, die Schottischen Lieder, sie haben so\nviel Stimmung! Aber die gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau hat eine wunderbare Stimme; die\ngn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau ist wirklich eine K\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bcnstlerin, aber wirklich!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was dilated and brilliant, like a flower in the morning sun. She\nfelt Birkin looking at her, as if he were jealous of her, and her\nbreasts thrilled, her veins were all golden. She was as happy as the\nsun that has just opened above clouds. And everybody seemed so admiring\nand radiant, it was perfect.\n\nAfter dinner she wanted to go out for a minute, to look at the world.\nThe company tried to dissuade her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was so terribly cold. But just to\nlook, she said.\n\nThey all four wrapped up warmly, and found themselves in a vague,\nunsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upper-world, that\nmade strange shadows before the stars. It was indeed cold, bruisingly,\nfrighteningly, unnaturally cold. Ursula could not believe the air in\nher nostrils. It seemed conscious, malevolent, purposive in its intense\nmurderous coldness.\n\nYet it was wonderful, an intoxication, a silence of dim, unrealised\nsnow, of the invisible intervening between her and the visible, between\nher and the flashing stars. She could see Orion sloping up. How\nwonderful he was, wonderful enough to make one cry aloud.\n\nAnd all around was this cradle of snow, and there was firm snow\nunderfoot, that struck with heavy cold through her boot-soles. It was\nnight, and silence. She imagined she could hear the stars. She imagined\ndistinctly she could hear the celestial, musical motion of the stars,\nquite near at hand. She seemed like a bird flying amongst their\nharmonious motion.\n\nAnd she clung close to Birkin. Suddenly she realised she did not know\nwhat he was thinking. She did not know where he was ranging.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy love!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, stopping to look at him.\n\nHis face was pale, his eyes dark, there was a faint spark of starlight\non them. And he saw her face soft and upturned to him, very near. He\nkissed her softly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you love me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cToo much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered quietly.\n\nShe clung a little closer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot too much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she pleaded.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cFar too much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, almost sadly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd does it make you sad, that I am everything to you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked,\nwistful. He held her close to him, kissing her, and saying, scarcely\naudible:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, but I feel like a beggar\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I feel poor.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was silent, looking at the stars now. Then she kissed him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be a beggar,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she pleaded, wistfully. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t ignominious that\nyou love me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is ignominious to feel poor, isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy? Why should it be?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked. He only stood still, in the\nterribly cold air that moved invisibly over the mountain tops, folding\nher round with his arms.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear this cold, eternal place without you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\ncouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear it, it would kill the quick of my life.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe kissed him again, suddenly.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you hate it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, puzzled, wondering.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIf I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t come near to you, if you weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t here, I should hate it.\nI couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he answered.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut the people are nice,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI mean the stillness, the cold, the frozen eternality,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe wondered. Then her spirit came home to him, nestling unconscious in\nhim.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, it is good we are warm and together,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nAnd they turned home again. They saw the golden lights of the hotel\nglowing out in the night of snow-silence, small in the hollow, like a\ncluster of yellow berries. It seemed like a bunch of sun-sparks, tiny\nand orange in the midst of the snow-darkness. Behind, was a high shadow\nof a peak, blotting out the stars, like a ghost.\n\nThey drew near to their home. They saw a man come from the dark\nbuilding, with a lighted lantern which swung golden, and made that his\ndark feet walked in a halo of snow. He was a small, dark figure in the\ndarkened snow. He unlatched the door of an outhouse. A smell of cows,\nhot, animal, almost like beef, came out on the heavily cold air. There\nwas a glimpse of two cattle in their dark stalls, then the door was\nshut again, and not a chink of light showed. It had reminded Ursula\nagain of home, of the Marsh, of her childhood, and of the journey to\nBrussels, and, strangely, of Anton Skrebensky.\n\nOh, God, could one bear it, this past which was gone down the abyss?\nCould she bear, that it ever had been! She looked round this silent,\nupper world of snow and stars and powerful cold. There was another\nworld, like views on a magic lantern; The Marsh, Cossethay, Ilkeston,\nlit up with a common, unreal light. There was a shadowy unreal Ursula,\na whole shadow-play of an unreal life. It was as unreal, and\ncircumscribed, as a magic-lantern show. She wished the slides could all\nbe broken. She wished it could be gone for ever, like a lantern-slide\nwhich was broken. She wanted to have no past. She wanted to have come\ndown from the slopes of heaven to this place, with Birkin, not to have\ntoiled out of the murk of her childhood and her upbringing, slowly, all\nsoiled. She felt that memory was a dirty trick played upon her. What\nwas this decree, that she should \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098remember\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099! Why not a bath of pure\noblivion, a new birth, without any recollections or blemish of a past\nlife. She was with Birkin, she had just come into life, here in the\nhigh snow, against the stars. What had she to do with parents and\nantecedents? She knew herself new and unbegotten, she had no father, no\nmother, no anterior connections, she was herself, pure and silvery, she\nbelonged only to the oneness with Birkin, a oneness that struck deeper\nnotes, sounding into the heart of the universe, the heart of reality,\nwhere she had never existed before.\n\nEven Gudrun was a separate unit, separate, separate, having nothing to\ndo with this self, this Ursula, in her new world of reality. That old\nshadow-world, the actuality of the past\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ah, let it go! She rose free on\nthe wings of her new condition.\n\nGudrun and Gerald had not come in. They had walked up the valley\nstraight in front of the house, not like Ursula and Birkin, on to the\nlittle hill at the right. Gudrun was driven by a strange desire. She\nwanted to plunge on and on, till she came to the end of the valley of\nsnow. Then she wanted to climb the wall of white finality, climb over,\ninto the peaks that sprang up like sharp petals in the heart of the\nfrozen, mysterious navel of the world. She felt that there, over the\nstrange blind, terrible wall of rocky snow, there in the navel of the\nmystic world, among the final cluster of peaks, there, in the infolded\nnavel of it all, was her consummation. If she could but come there,\nalone, and pass into the infolded navel of eternal snow and of\nuprising, immortal peaks of snow and rock, she would be a oneness with\nall, she would be herself the eternal, infinite silence, the sleeping,\ntimeless, frozen centre of the All.\n\nThey went back to the house, to the _Reunionsaal_. She was curious to\nsee what was going on. The men there made her alert, roused her\ncuriosity. It was a new taste of life for her, they were so prostrate\nbefore her, yet so full of life.\n\nThe party was boisterous; they were dancing all together, dancing the\n_Schuhplatteln_, the Tyrolese dance of the clapping hands and tossing\nthe partner in the air at the crisis. The Germans were all\nproficient\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094they were from Munich chiefly. Gerald also was quite\npassable. There were three zithers twanging away in a corner. It was a\nscene of great animation and confusion. The Professor was initiating\nUrsula into the dance, stamping, clapping, and swinging her high, with\namazing force and zest. When the crisis came even Birkin was behaving\nmanfully with one of the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s fresh, strong daughters, who was\nexceedingly happy. Everybody was dancing, there was the most boisterous\nturmoil.\n\nGudrun looked on with delight. The solid wooden floor resounded to the\nknocking heels of the men, the air quivered with the clapping hands and\nthe zither music, there was a golden dust about the hanging lamps.\n\nSuddenly the dance finished, Loerke and the students rushed out to\nbring in drinks. There was an excited clamour of voices, a clinking of\nmug-lids, a great crying of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Prosit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Prosit!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Loerke was everywhere at\nonce, like a gnome, suggesting drinks for the women, making an obscure,\nslightly risky joke with the men, confusing and mystifying the waiter.\n\nHe wanted very much to dance with Gudrun. From the first moment he had\nseen her, he wanted to make a connection with her. Instinctively she\nfelt this, and she waited for him to come up. But a kind of sulkiness\nkept him away from her, so she thought he disliked her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWill you _schuhpl\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4tteln, gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the large, fair youth,\nLoerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s companion. He was too soft, too humble for Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s taste. But\nshe wanted to dance, and the fair youth, who was called Leitner, was\nhandsome enough in his uneasy, slightly abject fashion, a humility that\ncovered a certain fear. She accepted him as a partner.\n\nThe zithers sounded out again, the dance began. Gerald led them,\nlaughing, with one of the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s daughters. Ursula danced with one\nof the students, Birkin with the other daughter of the Professor, the\nProfessor with Frau Kramer, and the rest of the men danced together,\nwith quite as much zest as if they had had women partners.\n\nBecause Gudrun had danced with the well-built, soft youth, his\ncompanion, Loerke, was more pettish and exasperated than ever, and\nwould not even notice her existence in the room. This piqued her, but\nshe made up to herself by dancing with the Professor, who was strong as\na mature, well-seasoned bull, and as full of coarse energy. She could\nnot bear him, critically, and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the\ndance, and tossed up into the air, on his coarse, powerful impetus. The\nProfessor enjoyed it too, he eyed her with strange, large blue eyes,\nfull of galvanic fire. She hated him for the seasoned, semi-paternal\nanimalism with which he regarded her, but she admired his weight of\nstrength.\n\nThe room was charged with excitement and strong, animal emotion. Loerke\nwas kept away from Gudrun, to whom he wanted to speak, as by a hedge of\nthorns, and he felt a sardonic ruthless hatred for this young\nlove-companion, Leitner, who was his penniless dependent. He mocked the\nyouth, with an acid ridicule, that made Leitner red in the face and\nimpotent with resentment.\n\nGerald, who had now got the dance perfectly, was dancing again with the\nyounger of the Professor\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s daughters, who was almost dying of virgin\nexcitement, because she thought Gerald so handsome, so superb. He had\nher in his power, as if she were a palpitating bird, a fluttering,\nflushing, bewildered creature. And it made him smile, as she shrank\nconvulsively between his hands, violently, when he must throw her into\nthe air. At the end, she was so overcome with prostrate love for him,\nthat she could scarcely speak sensibly at all.\n\nBirkin was dancing with Ursula. There were odd little fires playing in\nhis eyes, he seemed to have turned into something wicked and\nflickering, mocking, suggestive, quite impossible. Ursula was\nfrightened of him, and fascinated. Clear, before her eyes, as in a\nvision, she could see the sardonic, licentious mockery of his eyes, he\nmoved towards her with subtle, animal, indifferent approach. The\nstrangeness of his hands, which came quick and cunning, inevitably to\nthe vital place beneath her breasts, and, lifting with mocking,\nsuggestive impulse, carried her through the air as if without strength,\nthrough blackmagic, made her swoon with fear. For a moment she\nrevolted, it was horrible. She would break the spell. But before the\nresolution had formed she had submitted again, yielded to her fear. He\nknew all the time what he was doing, she could see it in his smiling,\nconcentrated eyes. It was his responsibility, she would leave it to\nhim.\n\nWhen they were alone in the darkness, she felt the strange,\nlicentiousness of him hovering upon her. She was troubled and repelled.\nWhy should he turn like this?\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked in dread.\n\nBut his face only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And yet she was\nfascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this\nspell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to\nsubmit, she wanted to know. What would he do to her?\n\nHe was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic\nsuggestivity that flickered over his face and looked from his narrowed\neyes, made her want to hide, to hide herself away from him and watch\nhim from somewhere unseen.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy are you like this?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she demanded again, rousing against him with\nsudden force and animosity.\n\nThe flickering fires in his eyes concentrated as he looked into her\neyes. Then the lids drooped with a faint motion of satiric contempt.\nThen they rose again to the same remorseless suggestivity. And she gave\nway, he might do as he would. His licentiousness was repulsively\nattractive. But he was self-responsible, she would see what it was.\n\nThey might do as they liked\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094this she realised as she went to sleep. How\ncould anything that gave one satisfaction be excluded? What was\ndegrading? Who cared? Degrading things were real, with a different\nreality. And he was so unabashed and unrestrained. Wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it rather\nhorrible, a man who could be so soulful and spiritual, now to be so\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she\nbalked at her own thoughts and memories: then she added\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so bestial? So\nbestial, they two!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so degraded! She winced. But after all, why not? She\nexulted as well. Why not be bestial, and go the whole round of\nexperience? She exulted in it. She was bestial. How good it was to be\nreally shameful! There would be no shameful thing she had not\nexperienced. Yet she was unabashed, she was herself. Why not? She was\nfree, when she knew everything, and no dark shameful things were denied\nher.\n\nGudrun, who had been watching Gerald in the _Reunionsaal_, suddenly\nthought:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe should have all the women he can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is his nature. It is absurd to\ncall him monogamous\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he is naturally promiscuous. That is his nature.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe thought came to her involuntarily. It shocked her somewhat. It was\nas if she had seen some new _Mene! Mene!_ upon the wall. Yet it was\nmerely true. A voice seemed to have spoken it to her so clearly, that\nfor the moment she believed in inspiration.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is really true,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself again.\n\nShe knew quite well she had believed it all along. She knew it\nimplicitly. But she must keep it dark\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094almost from herself. She must\nkeep it completely secret. It was knowledge for her alone, and scarcely\neven to be admitted to herself.\n\nThe deep resolve formed in her, to combat him. One of them must triumph\nover the other. Which should it be? Her soul steeled itself with\nstrength. Almost she laughed within herself, at her confidence. It woke\na certain keen, half contemptuous pity, tenderness for him: she was so\nruthless.\n\nEverybody retired early. The Professor and Loerke went into a small\nlounge to drink. They both watched Gudrun go along the landing by the\nrailing upstairs.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ein sch\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6nes Frauenzimmer_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said the Professor.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ja!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asserted Loerke, shortly.\n\nGerald walked with his queer, long wolf-steps across the bedroom to the\nwindow, stooped and looked out, then rose again, and turned to Gudrun,\nhis eyes sharp with an abstract smile. He seemed very tall to her, she\nsaw the glisten of his whitish eyebrows, that met between his brows.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow do you like it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nHe seemed to be laughing inside himself, quite unconsciously. She\nlooked at him. He was a phenomenon to her, not a human being: a sort of\ncreature, greedy.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI like it very much,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho do you like best downstairs?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, standing tall and\nglistening above her, with his glistening stiff hair erect.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWho do I like best?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated, wanting to answer his question, and\nfinding it difficult to collect herself. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nknow enough about them yet, to be able to say. Who do _you_ like best?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t care\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t like or dislike any of them. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nmatter about me. I wanted to know about you.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, going rather pale. The abstract, unconscious\nsmile in his eyes was intensified.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI wanted to know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe turned aside, breaking the spell. In some strange way, she felt he\nwas getting power over her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t tell you already,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nShe went to the mirror to take out the hairpins from her hair. She\nstood before the mirror every night for some minutes, brushing her fine\ndark hair. It was part of the inevitable ritual of her life.\n\nHe followed her, and stood behind her. She was busy with bent head,\ntaking out the pins and shaking her warm hair loose. When she looked\nup, she saw him in the glass standing behind her, watching\nunconsciously, not consciously seeing her, and yet watching, with\nfinepupilled eyes that _seemed_ to smile, and which were not really\nsmiling.\n\nShe started. It took all her courage for her to continue brushing her\nhair, as usual, for her to pretend she was at her ease. She was far,\nfar from being at her ease with him. She beat her brains wildly for\nsomething to say to him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat are your plans for tomorrow?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked nonchalantly, whilst her\nheart was beating so furiously, her eyes were so bright with strange\nnervousness, she felt he could not but observe. But she knew also that\nhe was completely blind, blind as a wolf looking at her. It was a\nstrange battle between her ordinary consciousness and his uncanny,\nblack-art consciousness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhat would you like to do?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe spoke emptily, his mind was sunk away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with easy protestation, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m ready for\nanything\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094anything will be fine for _me_, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m sure.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd to herself she was saying: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod, why am I so nervous\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094why are you so\nnervous, you fool. If he sees it I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m done for forever\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094you _know_ you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re\ndone for forever, if he sees the absurd state you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re in.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she smiled to herself as if it were all child\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s play. Meanwhile her\nheart was plunging, she was almost fainting. She could see him, in the\nmirror, as he stood there behind her, tall and over-arching\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094blond and\nterribly frightening. She glanced at his reflection with furtive eyes,\nwilling to give anything to save him from knowing she could see him. He\ndid not know she could see his reflection. He was looking\nunconsciously, glisteningly down at her head, from which the hair fell\nloose, as she brushed it with wild, nervous hand. She held her head\naside and brushed and brushed her hair madly. For her life, she could\nnot turn round and face him. For her life, _she could not_. And the\nknowledge made her almost sink to the ground in a faint, helpless,\nspent. She was aware of his frightening, impending figure standing\nclose behind her, she was aware of his hard, strong, unyielding chest,\nclose upon her back. And she felt she could not bear it any more, in a\nfew minutes she would fall down at his feet, grovelling at his feet,\nand letting him destroy her.\n\nThe thought pricked up all her sharp intelligence and presence of mind.\nShe dared not turn round to him\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and there he stood motionless,\nunbroken. Summoning all her strength, she said, in a full, resonant,\nnonchalant voice, that was forced out with all her remaining\nself-control:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me my\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHere her power fell inert. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094my what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she screamed in silence\nto herself.\n\nBut he had started round, surprised and startled that she should ask\nhim to look in her bag, which she always kept so _very_ private to\nherself.\n\nShe turned now, her face white, her dark eyes blazing with uncanny,\noverwrought excitement. She saw him stooping to the bag, undoing the\nloosely buckled strap, unattentive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYour what?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, a little enamel box\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094yellow\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094with a design of a cormorant plucking\nher breast\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe went towards him, stooping her beautiful, bare arm, and deftly\nturned some of her things, disclosing the box, which was exquisitely\npainted.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is it, see,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, taking it from under his eyes.\n\nAnd he was baffled now. He was left to fasten up the bag, whilst she\nswiftly did up her hair for the night, and sat down to unfasten her\nshoes. She would not turn her back to him any more.\n\nHe was baffled, frustrated, but unconscious. She had the whip hand over\nhim now. She knew he had not realised her terrible panic. Her heart was\nbeating heavily still. Fool, fool that she was, to get into such a\nstate! How she thanked God for Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s obtuse blindness.

When\nhe slept he seemed to crouch down in the bed, lapped up in his own\nstrength, that yet was hollow.\n\nAnd Gudrun slept strongly, a victorious sleep. Suddenly, she was almost\nfiercely awake. The small timber room glowed with the dawn, that came\nupwards from the low window. She could see down the valley when she\nlifted her head: the snow with a pinkish, half-revealed magic, the\nfringe of pine-trees at the bottom of the slope. And one tiny figure\nmoved over the vaguely-illuminated space.\n\nShe glanced at his watch; it was seven o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock. He was still completely\nasleep. And she was so hard awake, it was almost frightening\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a hard,\nmetallic wakefulness. She lay looking at him.\n\nHe slept in the subjection of his own health and defeat. She was\novercome by a sincere regard for him. Till now, she was afraid before\nhim. She lay and thought about him, what he was, what he represented in\nthe world. A fine, independent will, he had. She thought of the\nrevolution he had worked in the mines, in so short a time. She knew\nthat, if he were confronted with any problem, any hard actual\ndifficulty, he would overcome it. If he laid hold of any idea, he would\ncarry it through. He had the faculty of making order out of confusion.\nOnly let him grip hold of a situation, and he would bring to pass an\ninevitable conclusion.\n\nFor a few moments she was borne away on the wild wings of ambition.\nGerald, with his force of will and his power for comprehending the\nactual world, should be set to solve the problems of the day, the\nproblem of industrialism in the modern world. She knew he would, in the\ncourse of time, effect the changes he desired, he could re-organise the\nindustrial system. She knew he could do it. As an instrument, in these\nthings, he was marvellous, she had never seen any man with his\npotentiality. He was unaware of it, but she knew.\n\nHe only needed to be hitched on, he needed that his hand should be set\nto the task, because he was so unconscious. And this she could do. She\nwould marry him, he would go into Parliament in the Conservative\ninterest, he would clear up the great muddle of labour and industry. He\nwas so superbly fearless, masterful, he knew that every problem could\nbe worked out, in life as in geometry. And he would care neither about\nhimself nor about anything but the pure working out of the problem. He\nwas very pure, really.\n\nHer heart beat fast, she flew away on wings of elation, imagining a\nfuture. He would be a Napoleon of peace, or a Bismarck\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and she the\nwoman behind him. She had read Bismarck\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s letters, and had been deeply\nmoved by them. And Gerald would be freer, more dauntless than Bismarck.\n\nBut even as she lay in fictitious transport, bathed in the strange,\nfalse sunshine of hope in life, something seemed to snap in her, and a\nterrible cynicism began to gain upon her, blowing in like a wind.\nEverything turned to irony with her: the last flavour of everything was\nironical. When she felt her pang of undeniable reality, this was when\nshe knew the hard irony of hopes and ideas.\n\nShe lay and looked at him, as he slept. He was sheerly beautiful, he\nwas a perfect instrument. To her mind, he was a pure, inhuman, almost\nsuperhuman instrument. His instrumentality appealed so strongly to her,\nshe wished she were God, to use him as a tool.\n\nAnd at the same instant, came the ironical question: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat for?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She\nthought of the colliers\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 wives, with their linoleum and their lace\ncurtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. She thought of the\nwives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and\ntheir terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the\nsocial scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction,\nthe meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of\nCommons, the extant social world. My God!\n\nYoung as she was, Gudrun had touched the whole pulse of social England.\nShe had no ideas of rising in the world. She knew, with the perfect\ncynicism of cruel youth, that to rise in the world meant to have one\noutside show instead of another, the advance was like having a spurious\nhalf-crown instead of a spurious penny. The whole coinage of valuation\nwas spurious. Yet of course, her cynicism knew well enough that, in a\nworld where spurious coin was current, a bad sovereign was better than\na bad farthing. But rich and poor, she despised both alike.\n\nAlready she mocked at herself for her dreams. They could be fulfilled\neasily enough. But she recognised too well, in her spirit, the mockery\nof her own impulses. What did she care, that Gerald had created a\nrichly-paying industry out of an old worn-out concern? What did she\ncare? The worn-out concern and the rapid, splendidly organised\nindustry, they were bad money. Yet of course, she cared a great deal,\noutwardly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and outwardly was all that mattered, for inwardly was a bad\njoke.\n\nEverything was intrinsically a piece of irony to her. She leaned over\nGerald and said in her heart, with compassion:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, my dear, my dear, the game isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t worth even you. You are a fine\nthing really\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094why should you be used on such a poor show!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer heart was breaking with pity and grief for him. And at the same\nmoment, a grimace came over her mouth, of mocking irony at her own\nunspoken tirade. Ah, what a farce it was! She thought of Parnell and\nKatherine O\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099Shea. Parnell! After all, who can take the nationalisation\nof Ireland seriously? Who can take political Ireland really seriously,\nwhatever it does? And who can take political England seriously? Who\ncan? Who can care a straw, really, how the old patched-up Constitution\nis tinkered at any more? Who cares a button for our national ideas, any\nmore than for our national bowler hat? Aha, it is all old hat, it is\nall old bowler hat!\n\nThat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all it is, Gerald, my young hero. At any rate we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll spare\nourselves the nausea of stirring the old broth any more. You be\nbeautiful, my Gerald, and reckless. There _are_ perfect moments. Wake\nup, Gerald, wake up, convince me of the perfect moments. Oh, convince\nme, I need it.\n\nHe opened his eyes, and looked at her. She greeted him with a mocking,\nenigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety. Over his face went the\nreflection of the smile, he smiled, too, purely unconsciously.\n\nThat filled her with extraordinary delight, to see the smile cross his\nface, reflected from her face. She remembered that was how a baby\nsmiled. It filled her with extraordinary radiant delight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve done it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, dazed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cConvinced me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she bent down, kissing him passionately, passionately, so that he\nwas bewildered. He did not ask her of what he had convinced her, though\nhe meant to. He was glad she was kissing him. She seemed to be feeling\nfor his very heart to touch the quick of him. And he wanted her to\ntouch the quick of his being, he wanted that most of all.\n\nOutside, somebody was singing, in a manly, reckless handsome voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMach mir auf, mach mir auf, du Stolze,\nMach mir ein Feuer von Holze.\nVom Regen bin ich nass\nVom Regen bin ich nass\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun knew that that song would sound through her eternity, sung in a\nmanly, reckless, mocking voice. It marked one of her supreme moments,\nthe supreme pangs of her nervous gratification. There it was, fixed in\neternity for her.\n\nThe day came fine and bluish. There was a light wind blowing among the\nmountain tops, keen as a rapier where it touched, carrying with it a\nfine dust of snow-powder. Gerald went out with the fine, blind face of\na man who is in his state of fulfilment. Gudrun and he were in perfect\nstatic unity this morning, but unseeing and unwitting. They went out\nwith a toboggan, leaving Ursula and Birkin to follow.\n\nGudrun was all scarlet and royal blue\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a scarlet jersey and cap, and a\nroyal blue skirt and stockings. She went gaily over the white snow,\nwith Gerald beside her, in white and grey, pulling the little toboggan.\nThey grew small in the distance of snow, climbing the steep slope.\n\nFor Gudrun herself, she seemed to pass altogether into the whiteness of\nthe snow, she became a pure, thoughtless crystal. When she reached the\ntop of the slope, in the wind, she looked round, and saw peak beyond\npeak of rock and snow, bluish, transcendent in heaven. And it seemed to\nher like a garden, with the peaks for pure flowers, and her heart\ngathering them. She had no separate consciousness for Gerald.\n\nShe held on to him as they went sheering down over the keen slope. She\nfelt as if her senses were being whetted on some fine grindstone, that\nwas keen as flame. The snow sprinted on either side, like sparks from a\nblade that is being sharpened, the whiteness round about ran swifter,\nswifter, in pure flame the white slope flew against her, and she fused\nlike one molten, dancing globule, rushed through a white intensity.\nThen there was a great swerve at the bottom, when they swung as it were\nin a fall to earth, in the diminishing motion.\n\nThey came to rest. But when she rose to her feet, she could not stand.\nShe gave a strange cry, turned and clung to him, sinking her face on\nhis breast, fainting in him. Utter oblivion came over her, as she lay\nfor a few moments abandoned against him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he was saying. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it too much for you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut she heard nothing.\n\nWhen she came to, she stood up and looked round, astonished. Her face\nwas white, her eyes brilliant and large.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he repeated. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDid it upset you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him with her brilliant eyes that seemed to have undergone\nsome transfiguration, and she laughed, with a terrible merriment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, with triumphant joy. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt was the complete moment of my\nlife.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she looked at him with her dazzling, overweening laughter, like one\npossessed. A fine blade seemed to enter his heart, but he did not care,\nor take any notice.\n\nBut they climbed up the slope again, and they flew down through the\nwhite flame again, splendidly, splendidly. Gudrun was laughing and\nflashing, powdered with snow-crystals, Gerald worked perfectly. He felt\nhe could guide the toboggan to a hair-breadth, almost he could make it\npierce into the air and right into the very heart of the sky. It seemed\nto him the flying sledge was but his strength spread out, he had but to\nmove his arms, the motion was his own. They explored the great slopes,\nto find another slide. He felt there must be something better than they\nhad known. And he found what he desired, a perfect long, fierce sweep,\nsheering past the foot of a rock and into the trees at the base. It was\ndangerous, he knew. But then he knew also he would direct the sledge\nbetween his fingers.\n\nThe first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion, sleighing,\nskiing, skating, moving in an intensity of speed and white light that\nsurpassed life itself, and carried the souls of the human beings beyond\ninto an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal, frozen\nsnow.\n\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes became hard and strange, and as he went by on his skis he\nwas more like some powerful, fateful sigh than a man, his muscles\nelastic in a perfect, soaring trajectory, his body projected in pure\nflight, mindless, soulless, whirling along one perfect line of force.\n\nLuckily there came a day of snow, when they must all stay indoors:\notherwise Birkin said, they would all lose their faculties, and begin\nto utter themselves in cries and shrieks, like some strange, unknown\nspecies of snow-creatures.\n\nIt happened in the afternoon that Ursula sat in the _Reunionsaal_\ntalking to Loerke. The latter had seemed unhappy lately. He was lively\nand full of mischievous humour, as usual.\n\nBut Ursula had thought he was sulky about something. His partner, too,\nthe big, fair, good-looking youth, was ill at ease, going about as if\nhe belonged to nowhere, and was kept in some sort of subjection,\nagainst which he was rebelling.\n\nLoerke had hardly talked to Gudrun. His associate, on the other hand,\nhad paid her constantly a soft, over-deferential attention. Gudrun\nwanted to talk to Loerke. He was a sculptor, and she wanted to hear his\nview of his art. And his figure attracted her. There was the look of a\nlittle wastrel about him, that intrigued her, and an old man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s look,\nthat interested her, and then, beside this, an uncanny singleness, a\nquality of being by himself, not in contact with anybody else, that\nmarked out an artist to her. He was a chatterer, a magpie, a maker of\nmischievous word-jokes, that were sometimes very clever, but which\noften were not. And she could see in his brown, gnome\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s eyes, the black\nlook of inorganic misery, which lay behind all his small buffoonery.\n\nHis figure interested her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the figure of a boy, almost a street arab. He\nmade no attempt to conceal it. He always wore a simple loden suit, with\nknee breeches. His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise\nthe fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never\ningratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to\nhimself, for all his apparent playfulness.\n\nLeitner, his companion, was a great sportsman, very handsome with his\nbig limbs and his blue eyes. Loerke would go toboganning or skating, in\nlittle snatches, but he was indifferent. And his fine, thin nostrils,\nthe nostrils of a pure-bred street arab, would quiver with contempt at\nLeitner\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s splothering gymnastic displays. It was evident that the two\nmen who had travelled and lived together, sharing the same bedroom, had\nnow reached the stage of loathing. Leitner hated Loerke with an\ninjured, writhing, impotent hatred, and Loerke treated Leitner with a\nfine-quivering contempt and sarcasm. Soon the two would have to go\napart.\n\nAlready they were rarely together. Leitner ran attaching himself to\nsomebody or other, always deferring, Loerke was a good deal alone. Out\nof doors he wore a Westphalian cap, a close brown-velvet head with big\nbrown velvet flaps down over his ears, so that he looked like a\nlop-eared rabbit, or a troll. His face was brown-red, with a dry,\nbright skin, that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions. His\neyes were arresting\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094brown, full, like a rabbit\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, or like a troll\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s, or\nlike the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of\nknowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried\nto talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with his\nwatchful dark eyes, but entering into no relation with her. He had made\nher feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to\nhim. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try\nit at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said,\nnevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.\n\nThis afternoon, however, she came into the lounge as he was talking to\nUrsula. His fine, black hair somehow reminded her of a bat, thin as it\nwas on his full, sensitive-looking head, and worn away at the temples.\nHe sat hunched up, as if his spirit were bat-like. And Gudrun could see\nhe was making some slow confidence to Ursula, unwilling, a slow,\ngrudging, scanty self-revelation. She went and sat by her sister.\n\nHe looked at her, then looked away again, as if he took no notice of\nher. But as a matter of fact, she interested him deeply.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIsn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it interesting, Prune,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, turning to her sister,\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHerr Loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in Cologne, for the\noutside, the street.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him, at his thin, brown, nervous hands, that were\nprehensile, and somehow like talons, like \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cgriffes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d inhuman.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat _in?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Aus was?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Ursula.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Granit_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\nIt had become immediately a laconic series of question and answer\nbetween fellow craftsmen.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat is the relief?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Alto relievo._\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd at what height?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was very interesting to Gudrun to think of his making the great\ngranite frieze for a great granite factory in Cologne. She got from him\nsome notion of the design. It was a representation of a fair, with\npeasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment, drunk and absurd in\ntheir modern dress, whirling ridiculously in roundabouts, gaping at\nshows, kissing and staggering and rolling in knots, swinging in\nswing-boats, and firing down shooting galleries, a frenzy of chaotic\nmotion.\n\nThere was a swift discussion of technicalities. Gudrun was very much\nimpressed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut how wonderful, to have such a factory!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Ursula. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIs the\nwhole building fine?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe frieze is part of the whole architecture.\nYes, it is a colossal thing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThen he seemed to stiffen, shrugged his shoulders, and went on:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSculpture and architecture must go together. The day for irrelevant\nstatues, as for wall pictures, is over. As a matter of fact sculpture\nis always part of an architectural conception.

There is not only _no need_\nfor our places of work to be ugly, but their ugliness ruins the work,\nin the end. Men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness.\nIn the end it will hurt too much, and they will wither because of it.\nAnd this will wither the _work_ as well. They will think the work\nitself is ugly: the machines, the very act of labour. Whereas the\nmachinery and the acts of labour are extremely, maddeningly beautiful.\nBut this will be the end of our civilisation, when people will not work\nbecause work has become so intolerable to their senses, it nauseates\nthem too much, they would rather starve. _Then_ we shall see the hammer\nused only for smashing, then we shall see it.

Loerke watched Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, to see her judgment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd do you think then,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat art should serve industry?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cArt should _interpret_ industry, as art once interpreted religion,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\nsaid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut does your fair interpret industry?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCertainly.

All his nature\nheld him back from confessing. And yet her large, grave eyes upon him\nseemed to open some valve in his veins, and involuntarily he was\ntelling.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy father was a man who did not like work, and we had no mother.

But he suffered in his discovery. She too was fascinated\nby him, fascinated, as if some strange creature, a rabbit or a bat, or\na brown seal, had begun to talk to her. But also, she knew what he was\nunconscious of, his tremendous power of understanding, of apprehending\nher living motion. He did not know his own power. He did not know how,\nwith his full, submerged, watchful eyes, he could look into her and see\nher, what she was, see her secrets. He would only want her to be\nherself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he knew her verily, with a subconscious, sinister knowledge,\ndevoid of illusions and hopes.\n\nTo Gudrun, there was in Loerke the rock-bottom of all life. Everybody\nelse had their illusion, must have their illusion, their before and\nafter. But he, with a perfect stoicism, did without any before and\nafter, dispensed with all illusion. He did not deceive himself in the\nlast issue. In the last issue he cared about nothing, he was troubled\nabout nothing, he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with\nanything. He existed a pure, unconnected will, stoical and\nmomentaneous. There was only his work.\n\nIt was curious too, how his poverty, the degradation of his earlier\nlife, attracted her. There was something insipid and tasteless to her,\nin the idea of a gentleman, a man who had gone the usual course through\nschool and university. A certain violent sympathy, however, came up in\nher for this mud-child. He seemed to be the very stuff of the\nunderworld of life. There was no going beyond him.\n\nUrsula too was attracted by Loerke. In both sisters he commanded a\ncertain homage. But there were moments when to Ursula he seemed\nindescribably inferior, false, a vulgarism.\n\nBoth Birkin and Gerald disliked him, Gerald ignoring him with some\ncontempt, Birkin exasperated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do the women find so impressive in that little brat?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald\nasked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod alone knows,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Birkin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cunless it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s some sort of appeal he\nmakes to them, which flatters them and has such a power over them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald looked up in surprise.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Does_ he make an appeal to them?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh yes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied Birkin. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is the perfectly subjected being,\nexisting almost like a criminal.

He\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s further on than we are. He hates the ideal more acutely. He\n_hates_ the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a\nJew\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094or part Jewish.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cProbably,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut why does anybody care about him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBecause they hate the ideal also, in their souls.

It was no use beginning when the men were there. Then they\ncould get into no touch with the isolated little sculptor. He had to be\nalone with them. And he preferred Ursula to be there, as a sort of\ntransmitter to Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you do nothing but architectural sculpture?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun asked him one\nevening.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot now,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have done all sorts\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094except portraits\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I never\ndid portraits.

He returned\nalmost immediately with a little roll of paper, which he handed to her.\nShe unrolled it. It was a photogravure reproduction of a statuette,\nsigned F. Loerke.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is quite an early thing\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094_not_ mechanical,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cmore\npopular.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe statuette was of a naked girl, small, finely made, sitting on a\ngreat naked horse. The girl was young and tender, a mere bud. She was\nsitting sideways on the horse, her face in her hands, as if in shame\nand grief, in a little abandon. Her hair, which was short and must be\nflaxen, fell forward, divided, half covering her hands.\n\nHer limbs were young and tender. Her legs, scarcely formed yet, the\nlegs of a maiden just passing towards cruel womanhood, dangled\nchildishly over the side of the powerful horse, pathetically, the small\nfeet folded one over the other, as if to hide. But there was no hiding.\nThere she was exposed naked on the naked flank of the horse.\n\nThe horse stood stock still, stretched in a kind of start. It was a\nmassive, magnificent stallion, rigid with pent-up power. Its neck was\narched and terrible, like a sickle, its flanks were pressed back, rigid\nwith power.\n\nGudrun went pale, and a darkness came over her eyes, like shame, she\nlooked up with a certain supplication, almost slave-like. He glanced at\nher, and jerked his head a little.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow big is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, in a toneless voice, persisting in\nappearing casual and unaffected.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow big?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, glancing again at her. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWithout pedestal\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094so\nhigh\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he measured with his hand\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwith pedestal, so\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at her steadily. There was a little brusque, turgid contempt\nfor her in his swift gesture, and she seemed to cringe a little.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd what is it done in?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked, throwing back her head and looking\nat him with affected coldness.\n\nHe still gazed at her steadily, and his dominance was not shaken.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBronze\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094green bronze.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGreen bronze!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d repeated Gudrun, coldly accepting his challenge. She\nwas thinking of the slender, immature, tender limbs of the girl, smooth\nand cold in green bronze.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she murmured, looking up at him with a certain dark\nhomage.\n\nHe closed his eyes and looked aside, triumphant.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cdid you make the horse so stiff?

Horses are\nsensitive, quite delicate and sensitive, really.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe raised his shoulders, spread his hands in a shrug of slow\nindifference, as much as to inform her she was an amateur and an\nimpertinent nobody.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Wissen Sie_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, with an insulting patience and condescension\nin his voice, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat horse is a certain _form_, part of a whole form.

You mean an idea you have in\n_your_ head, and which you want to see represented. There is another\nidea altogether, quite another idea. Call it a horse if you like, or\nsay it is not a horse. I have just as much right to say that _your_\nhorse isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t a horse, that it is a falsity of your own make-up.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nUrsula wavered, baffled.

He\nwould not trouble to answer this last charge.\n\nGudrun too was silent in exasperated contempt. Ursula _was_ such an\ninsufferable outsider, rushing in where angels would fear to tread. But\nthen\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094fools must be suffered, if not gladly.\n\nBut Ursula was persistent too.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAs for your world of art and your world of reality,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cyou\nhave to separate the two, because you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear to know what you are.\nYou can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t bear to realise what a stock, stiff, hide-bound brutality you\n_are_ really, so you say \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the world of art.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 The world of art is\nonly the truth about the real world, that\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s all\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094but you are too far\ngone to see it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was white and trembling, intent. Gudrun and Loerke sat in stiff\ndislike of her. Gerald too, who had come up in the beginning of the\nspeech, stood looking at her in complete disapproval and opposition. He\nfelt she was undignified, she put a sort of vulgarity over the\nesotericism which gave man his last distinction. He joined his forces\nwith the other two. They all three wanted her to go away. But she sat\non in silence, her soul weeping, throbbing violently, her fingers\ntwisting her handkerchief.\n\nThe others maintained a dead silence, letting the display of Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nobtrusiveness pass by. Then Gudrun asked, in a voice that was quite\ncool and casual, as if resuming a casual conversation:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas the girl a model?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Nein, sie war kein Modell.

She saw the girl\nart-student, unformed and of pernicious recklessness, too young, her\nstraight flaxen hair cut short, hanging just into her neck, curving\ninwards slightly, because it was rather thick; and Loerke, the\nwell-known master-sculptor, and the girl, probably well-brought-up, and\nof good family, thinking herself so great to be his mistress. Oh how\nwell she knew the common callousness of it all. Dresden, Paris, or\nLondon, what did it matter? She knew it.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere is she now?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Ursula asked.\n\nLoerke raised his shoulders, to convey his complete ignorance and\nindifference.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat is already six years ago,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said; \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cshe will be twenty-three\nyears old, no more good.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald had picked up the picture and was looking at it.

They were turned together,\nhalf covering each other in pathetic shyness and fear. He looked at\nthem a long time, fascinated. Then, in some pain, he put the picture\naway from him.

There was a queer, indefinable\nhostility between the two men, lately. Birkin was on the whole dim and\nindifferent, drifting along in a dim, easy flow, unnoticing and\npatient, since he came abroad, whilst Gerald on the other hand, was\nintense and gripped into white light, agonistes. The two men revoked\none another.\n\nGerald and Gudrun were very kind to the two who were departing,\nsolicitous for their welfare as if they were two children.

But these were\nthick silk stockings, vermilion, cornflower blue, and grey, bought in\nParis. The grey ones were knitted, seamless and heavy. Ursula was in\nraptures.

Ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile. There was an\ninsult in Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s protective patronage that was really too hurting.\nFeeling her sister\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s resistance, Gudrun drew awkwardly away, turned\nover the pillow, and disclosed the stockings again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHa\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ha!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed, rather hollowly. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow we do talk indeed\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094new\nworlds and old\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd they passed to the familiar worldly subjects.\n\nGerald and Birkin had walked on ahead, waiting for the sledge to\novertake them, conveying the departing guests.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow much longer will you stay here?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin, glancing up at\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s very red, almost blank face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh, I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t say,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gerald replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTill we get tired of it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re not afraid of the snow melting first?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Birkin.\n\nGerald laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDoes it melt?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThings are all right with you then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Birkin.\n\nGerald screwed up his eyes a little.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll right?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI never know what those common words mean.

Gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell.\nThey wanted to go apart, all of them. Birkin took his place, and the\nsledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow,\nwaving. Something froze Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart, seeing them standing there in\nthe isolation of the snow, growing smaller and more isolated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXX.\n\n\n SNOWED UP\n\nWhen Ursula and Birkin were gone, Gudrun felt herself free in her\ncontest with Gerald. As they grew more used to each other, he seemed to\npress upon her more and more. At first she could manage him, so that\nher own will was always left free. But very soon, he began to ignore\nher female tactics, he dropped his respect for her whims and her\nprivacies, he began to exert his own will blindly, without submitting\nto hers.\n\nAlready a vital conflict had set in, which frightened them both. But he\nwas alone, whilst already she had begun to cast round for external\nresource.\n\nWhen Ursula had gone, Gudrun felt her own existence had become stark\nand elemental. She went and crouched alone in her bedroom, looking out\nof the window at the big, flashing stars. In front was the faint shadow\nof the mountain-knot. That was the pivot. She felt strange and\ninevitable, as if she were centred upon the pivot of all existence,\nthere was no further reality.\n\nPresently Gerald opened the door. She knew he would not be long before\nhe came. She was rarely alone, he pressed upon her like a frost,\ndeadening her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAre you alone in the dark?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. And she could tell by his tone he\nresented it, he resented this isolation she had drawn round herself.\nYet, feeling static and inevitable, she was kind towards him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWould you like to light the candle?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nHe did not answer, but came and stood behind her, in the darkness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLook,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cat that lovely star up there. Do you know its name?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe crouched beside her, to look through the low window.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is very fine.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ it beautiful!

The impertinence made his veins go cold, he was\ninsensible. She held her arms round his neck, in a triumph of pity.

A terrible weariness overcame him, he felt he\nmust lie on the floor. Dropping off his clothes, he got into bed, and\nlay like a man suddenly overcome by drunkenness, the darkness lifting\nand plunging as if he were lying upon a black, giddy sea. He lay still\nin this strange, horrific reeling for some time, purely unconscious.\n\nAt length she slipped from her own bed and came over to him. He\nremained rigid, his back to her. He was all but unconscious.\n\nShe put her arms round his terrifying, insentient body, and laid her\ncheek against his hard shoulder.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was no change in him. She caught him against her. She pressed her\nbreasts against his shoulders, she kissed his shoulder, through the\nsleeping jacket. Her mind wondered, over his rigid, unliving body. She\nwas bewildered, and insistent, only her will was set for him to speak\nto her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGerald, my dear!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered, bending over him, kissing his ear.\n\nHer warm breath playing, flying rhythmically over his ear, seemed to\nrelax the tension. She could feel his body gradually relaxing a little,\nlosing its terrifying, unnatural rigidity. Her hands clutched his\nlimbs, his muscles, going over him spasmodically.\n\nThe hot blood began to flow again through his veins, his limbs relaxed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTurn round to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she whispered, forlorn with insistence and triumph.\n\nSo at last he was given again, warm and flexible. He turned and\ngathered her in his arms. And feeling her soft against him, so\nperfectly and wondrously soft and recipient, his arms tightened on her.\nShe was as if crushed, powerless in him. His brain seemed hard and\ninvincible now like a jewel, there was no resisting him.\n\nHis passion was awful to her, tense and ghastly, and impersonal, like a\ndestruction, ultimate. She felt it would kill her. She was being\nkilled.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy God, my God,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, in anguish, in his embrace, feeling her\nlife being killed within her. And when he was kissing her, soothing\nher, her breath came slowly, as if she were really spent, dying.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShall I die, shall I die?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated to herself.\n\nAnd in the night, and in him, there was no answer to the question.\n\nAnd yet, next day, the fragment of her which was not destroyed remained\nintact and hostile, she did not go away, she remained to finish the\nholiday, admitting nothing. He scarcely ever left her alone, but\nfollowed her like a shadow, he was like a doom upon her, a continual\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthou shalt,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthou shalt not.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Sometimes it was he who seemed\nstrongest, whist she was almost gone, creeping near the earth like a\nspent wind; sometimes it was the reverse. But always it was this\neternal see-saw, one destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified\nbecause the other was nulled.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn the end,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall go away from him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can be free of her,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to himself in his paroxysms of\nsuffering.\n\nAnd he set himself to be free. He even prepared to go away, to leave\nher in the lurch. But for the first time there was a flaw in his will.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhere shall I go?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked himself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you be self-sufficient?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied to himself, putting himself\nupon his pride.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cSelf-sufficient!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he repeated.\n\nIt seemed to him that Gudrun was sufficient unto herself, closed round\nand completed, like a thing in a case. In the calm, static reason of\nhis soul, he recognised this, and admitted it was her right, to be\nclosed round upon herself, self-complete, without desire. He realised\nit, he admitted it, it only needed one last effort on his own part, to\nwin for himself the same completeness. He knew that it only needed one\nconvulsion of his will for him to be able to turn upon himself also, to\nclose upon himself as a stone fixes upon itself, and is impervious,\nself-completed, a thing isolated.\n\nThis knowledge threw him into a terrible chaos. Because, however much\nhe might mentally _will_ to be immune and self-complete, the desire for\nthis state was lacking, and he could not create it. He could see that,\nto exist at all, he must be perfectly free of Gudrun, leave her if she\nwanted to be left, demand nothing of her, have no claim upon her.\n\nBut then, to have no claim upon her, he must stand by himself, in sheer\nnothingness. And his brain turned to nought at the idea. It was a state\nof nothingness. On the other hand, he might give in, and fawn to her.\nOr, finally, he might kill her. Or he might become just indifferent,\npurposeless, dissipated, momentaneous. But his nature was too serious,\nnot gay enough or subtle enough for mocking licentiousness.\n\nA strange rent had been torn in him; like a victim that is torn open\nand given to the heavens, so he had been torn apart and given to\nGudrun. How should he close again? This wound, this strange,\ninfinitely-sensitive opening of his soul, where he was exposed, like an\nopen flower, to all the universe, and in which he was given to his\ncomplement, the other, the unknown, this wound, this disclosure, this\nunfolding of his own covering, leaving him incomplete, limited,\nunfinished, like an open flower under the sky, this was his cruellest\njoy. Why then should he forego it? Why should he close up and become\nimpervious, immune, like a partial thing in a sheath, when he had\nbroken forth, like a seed that has germinated, to issue forth in being,\nembracing the unrealised heavens.\n\nHe would keep the unfinished bliss of his own yearning even through the\ntorture she inflicted upon him. A strange obstinacy possessed him. He\nwould not go away from her whatever she said or did. A strange, deathly\nyearning carried him along with her. She was the determinating\ninfluence of his very being, though she treated him with contempt,\nrepeated rebuffs, and denials, still he would never be gone, since in\nbeing near her, even, he felt the quickening, the going forth in him,\nthe release, the knowledge of his own limitation and the magic of the\npromise, as well as the mystery of his own destruction and\nannihilation.\n\nShe tortured the open heart of him even as he turned to her. And she\nwas tortured herself. It may have been her will was stronger. She felt,\nwith horror, as if he tore at the bud of her heart, tore it open, like\nan irreverent persistent being. Like a boy who pulls off a fly\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s wings,\nor tears open a bud to see what is in the flower, he tore at her\nprivacy, at her very life, he would destroy her as an immature bud,\ntorn open, is destroyed.\n\nShe might open towards him, a long while hence, in her dreams, when she\nwas a pure spirit. But now she was not to be violated and ruined. She\nclosed against him fiercely.\n\nThey climbed together, at evening, up the high slope, to see the\nsunset. In the finely breathing, keen wind they stood and watched the\nyellow sun sink in crimson and disappear. Then in the east the peaks\nand ridges glowed with living rose, incandescent like immortal flowers\nagainst a brown-purple sky, a miracle, whilst down below the world was\na bluish shadow, and above, like an annunciation, hovered a rosy\ntransport in mid-air.\n\nTo her it was so beautiful, it was a delirium, she wanted to gather the\nglowing, eternal peaks to her breast, and die. He saw them, saw they\nwere beautiful. But there arose no clamour in his breast, only a\nbitterness that was visionary in itself. He wished the peaks were grey\nand unbeautiful, so that she should not get her support from them. Why\ndid she betray the two of them so terribly, in embracing the glow of\nthe evening? Why did she leave him standing there, with the ice-wind\nblowing through his heart, like death, to gratify herself among the\nrosy snow-tips?\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat does the twilight matter?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhy do you grovel before it?\nIs it so important to you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe winced in violation and in fury.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGo away,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cand leave me to it. It is beautiful, beautiful,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\nshe sang in strange, rhapsodic tones. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is the most beautiful thing I\nhave ever seen in my life. Don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t try to come between it and me. Take\nyourself away, you are out of place\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe stood back a little, and left her standing there, statue-like,\ntransported into the mystic glowing east. Already the rose was fading,\nlarge white stars were flashing out. He waited. He would forego\neverything but the yearning.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThat was the most perfect thing I have ever seen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said in cold,\nbrutal tones, when at last she turned round to him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt amazes me that\nyou should want to destroy it. If you can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see it yourself, why try to\ndebar me?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d But in reality, he had destroyed it for her, she was\nstraining after a dead effect.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne day,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, softly, looking up at her, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall destroy _you_,\nas you stand looking at the sunset; because you are such a liar.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a soft, voluptuous promise to himself in the words. She was\nchilled but arrogant.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHa!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am not afraid of your threats!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She denied herself\nto him, she kept her room rigidly private to herself. But he waited on,\nin a curious patience, belonging to his yearning for her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIn the end,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to himself with real voluptuous promise, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhen it\nreaches that point, I shall do away with her.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And he trembled\ndelicately in every limb, in anticipation, as he trembled in his most\nviolent accesses of passionate approach to her, trembling with too much\ndesire.\n\nShe had a curious sort of allegiance with Loerke, all the while, now,\nsomething insidious and traitorous. Gerald knew of it. But in the\nunnatural state of patience, and the unwillingness to harden himself\nagainst her, in which he found himself, he took no notice, although her\nsoft kindliness to the other man, whom he hated as a noxious insect,\nmade him shiver again with an access of the strange shuddering that\ncame over him repeatedly.\n\nHe left her alone only when he went skiing, a sport he loved, and which\nshe did not practise. Then he seemed to sweep out of life, to be a\nprojectile into the beyond. And often, when he went away, she talked to\nthe little German sculptor. They had an invariable topic, in their art.\n\nThey were almost of the same ideas. He hated Mestrovic, was not\nsatisfied with the Futurists, he liked the West African wooden figures,\nthe Aztec art, Mexican and Central American. He saw the grotesque, and\na curious sort of mechanical motion intoxicated him, a confusion in\nnature. They had a curious game with each other, Gudrun and Loerke, of\ninfinite suggestivity, strange and leering, as if they had some\nesoteric understanding of life, that they alone were initiated into the\nfearful central secrets, that the world dared not know. Their whole\ncorrespondence was in a strange, barely comprehensible suggestivity,\nthey kindled themselves at the subtle lust of the Egyptians or the\nMexicans. The whole game was one of subtle inter-suggestivity, and they\nwanted to keep it on the plane of suggestion. From their verbal and\nphysical nuances they got the highest satisfaction in the nerves, from\na queer interchange of half-suggested ideas, looks, expressions and\ngestures, which were quite intolerable, though incomprehensible, to\nGerald. He had no terms in which to think of their commerce, his terms\nwere much too gross.\n\nThe suggestion of primitive art was their refuge, and the inner\nmysteries of sensation their object of worship. Art and Life were to\nthem the Reality and the Unreality.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOf course,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009clife doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t _really_ matter\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s art\nwhich is central. What one does in one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s life has _peu de rapport_, it\ndoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t signify much.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, that is so, exactly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d replied the sculptor. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat one does in\none\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s art, that is the breath of one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s being. What one does in one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nlife, that is a bagatelle for the outsiders to fuss about.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nIt was curious what a sense of elation and freedom Gudrun found in this\ncommunication. She felt established for ever. Of course Gerald was\n_bagatelle_. Love was one of the temporal things in her life, except in\nso far as she was an artist. She thought of Cleopatra\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Cleopatra must\nhave been an artist; she reaped the essential from a man, she harvested\nthe ultimate sensation, and threw away the husk; and Mary Stuart, and\nthe great Rachel, panting with her lovers after the theatre, these were\nthe exoteric exponents of love. After all, what was the lover but fuel\nfor the transport of this subtle knowledge, for a female art, the art\nof pure, perfect knowledge in sensuous understanding.\n\nOne evening Gerald was arguing with Loerke about Italy and Tripoli. The\nEnglishman was in a strange, inflammable state, the German was excited.\nIt was a contest of words, but it meant a conflict of spirit between\nthe two men. And all the while Gudrun could see in Gerald an arrogant\nEnglish contempt for a foreigner. Although Gerald was quivering, his\neyes flashing, his face flushed, in his argument there was a\nbrusqueness, a savage contempt in his manner, that made Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s blood\nflare up, and made Loerke keen and mortified. For Gerald came down like\na sledge-hammer with his assertions, anything the little German said\nwas merely contemptible rubbish.\n\nAt last Loerke turned to Gudrun, raising his hands in helpless irony, a\nshrug of ironical dismissal, something appealing and child-like.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Sehen sie, gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he began.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Bitte sagen Sie nicht immer, gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4dige Frau_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d cried Gudrun, her eyes\nflashing, her cheeks burning. She looked like a vivid Medusa. Her voice\nwas loud and clamorous, the other people in the room were startled.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPlease don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t call me Mrs Crich,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried aloud.\n\nThe name, in Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s mouth particularly, had been an intolerable\nhumiliation and constraint upon her, these many days.\n\nThe two men looked at her in amazement. Gerald went white at the\ncheek-bones.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat shall I say, then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d asked Loerke, with soft, mocking insinuation.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Sagen Sie nur nicht das_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she muttered, her cheeks flushed crimson.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot that, at least.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe saw, by the dawning look on Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face, that he had understood.\nShe was _not_ Mrs Crich! So-o-, that explained a great deal.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Soll ich Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein sagen?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, malevolently.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am not married,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with some hauteur.\n\nHer heart was fluttering now, beating like a bewildered bird. She knew\nshe had dealt a cruel wound, and she could not bear it.\n\nGerald sat erect, perfectly still, his face pale and calm, like the\nface of a statue. He was unaware of her, or of Loerke or anybody. He\nsat perfectly still, in an unalterable calm. Loerke, meanwhile, was\ncrouching and glancing up from under his ducked head.\n\nGudrun was tortured for something to say, to relieve the suspense. She\ntwisted her face in a smile, and glanced knowingly, almost sneering, at\nGerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTruth is best,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to him, with a grimace.\n\nBut now again she was under his domination; now, because she had dealt\nhim this blow; because she had destroyed him, and she did not know how\nhe had taken it. She watched him. He was interesting to her. She had\nlost her interest in Loerke.\n\nGerald rose at length, and went over in a leisurely still movement, to\nthe Professor. The two began a conversation on Goethe.\n\nShe was rather piqued by the simplicity of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s demeanour this\nevening. He did not seem angry or disgusted, only he looked curiously\ninnocent and pure, really beautiful. Sometimes it came upon him, this\nlook of clear distance, and it always fascinated her.\n\nShe waited, troubled, throughout the evening. She thought he would\navoid her, or give some sign. But he spoke to her simply and\nunemotionally, as he would to anyone else in the room. A certain peace,\nan abstraction possessed his soul.\n\nShe went to his room, hotly, violently in love with him. He was so\nbeautiful and inaccessible. He kissed her, he was a lover to her. And\nshe had extreme pleasure of him. But he did not come to, he remained\nremote and candid, unconscious. She wanted to speak to him. But this\ninnocent, beautiful state of unconsciousness that had come upon him\nprevented her. She felt tormented and dark.\n\nIn the morning, however, he looked at her with a little aversion, some\nhorror and some hatred darkening into his eyes. She withdrew on to her\nold ground. But still he would not gather himself together, against\nher.\n\nLoerke was waiting for her now. The little artist, isolated in his own\ncomplete envelope, felt that here at last was a woman from whom he\ncould get something. He was uneasy all the while, waiting to talk with\nher, subtly contriving to be near her. Her presence filled him with\nkeenness and excitement, he gravitated cunningly towards her, as if she\nhad some unseen force of attraction.\n\nHe was not in the least doubtful of himself, as regards Gerald. Gerald\nwas one of the outsiders. Loerke only hated him for being rich and\nproud and of fine appearance. All these things, however, riches, pride\nof social standing, handsome physique, were externals. When it came to\nthe relation with a woman such as Gudrun, he, Loerke, had an approach\nand a power that Gerald never dreamed of.\n\nHow should Gerald hope to satisfy a woman of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s calibre? Did he\nthink that pride or masterful will or physical strength would help him?\nLoerke knew a secret beyond these things. The greatest power is the one\nthat is subtle and adjusts itself, not one which blindly attacks. And\nhe, Loerke, had understanding where Gerald was a calf. He, Loerke,\ncould penetrate into depths far out of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s knowledge. Gerald was\nleft behind like a postulant in the ante-room of this temple of\nmysteries, this woman. But he Loerke, could he not penetrate into the\ninner darkness, find the spirit of the woman in its inner recess, and\nwrestle with it there, the central serpent that is coiled at the core\nof life.\n\nWhat was it, after all, that a woman wanted? Was it mere social effect,\nfulfilment of ambition in the social world, in the community of\nmankind? Was it even a union in love and goodness? Did she want\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cgoodness\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d? Who but a fool would accept this of Gudrun? This was but\nthe street view of her wants. Cross the threshold, and you found her\ncompletely, completely cynical about the social world and its\nadvantages. Once inside the house of her soul and there was a pungent\natmosphere of corrosion, an inflamed darkness of sensation, and a\nvivid, subtle, critical consciousness, that saw the world distorted,\nhorrific.\n\nWhat then, what next? Was it sheer blind force of passion that would\nsatisfy her now? Not this, but the subtle thrills of extreme sensation\nin reduction. It was an unbroken will reacting against her unbroken\nwill in a myriad subtle thrills of reduction, the last subtle\nactivities of analysis and breaking down, carried out in the darkness\nof her, whilst the outside form, the individual, was utterly unchanged,\neven sentimental in its poses.\n\nBut between two particular people, any two people on earth, the range\nof pure sensational experience is limited. The climax of sensual\nreaction, once reached in any direction, is reached finally, there is\nno going on. There is only repetition possible, or the going apart of\nthe two protagonists, or the subjugating of the one will to the other,\nor death.\n\nGerald had penetrated all the outer places of Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soul. He was to\nher the most crucial instance of the existing world, the _ne plus\nultra_ of the world of man as it existed for her. In him she knew the\nworld, and had done with it. Knowing him finally she was the Alexander\nseeking new worlds. But there _were_ no new worlds, there were no more\n_men_, there were only creatures, little, ultimate _creatures_ like\nLoerke. The world was finished now, for her. There was only the inner,\nindividual darkness, sensation within the ego, the obscene religious\nmystery of ultimate reduction, the mystic frictional activities of\ndiabolic reducing down, disintegrating the vital organic body of life.\n\nAll this Gudrun knew in her subconsciousness, not in her mind. She knew\nher next step\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she knew what she should move on to, when she left\nGerald. She was afraid of Gerald, that he might kill her. But she did\nnot intend to be killed. A fine thread still united her to him. It\nshould not be _her_ death which broke it. She had further to go, a\nfurther, slow exquisite experience to reap, unthinkable subtleties of\nsensation to know, before she was finished.\n\nOf the last series of subtleties, Gerald was not capable. He could not\ntouch the quick of her. But where his ruder blows could not penetrate,\nthe fine, insinuating blade of Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s insect-like comprehension\ncould. At least, it was time for her now to pass over to the other, the\ncreature, the final craftsman. She knew that Loerke, in his innermost\nsoul, was detached from everything, for him there was neither heaven\nnor earth nor hell. He admitted no allegiance, he gave no adherence\nanywhere. He was single and, by abstraction from the rest, absolute in\nhimself.\n\nWhereas in Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soul there still lingered some attachment to the\nrest, to the whole. And this was his limitation. He was limited,\n_born\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9_, subject to his necessity, in the last issue, for goodness, for\nrighteousness, for oneness with the ultimate purpose. That the ultimate\npurpose might be the perfect and subtle experience of the process of\ndeath, the will being kept unimpaired, that was not allowed in him. And\nthis was his limitation.\n\nThere was a hovering triumph in Loerke, since Gudrun had denied her\nmarriage with Gerald. The artist seemed to hover like a creature on the\nwing, waiting to settle. He did not approach Gudrun violently, he was\nnever ill-timed. But carried on by a sure instinct in the complete\ndarkness of his soul, he corresponded mystically with her,\nimperceptibly, but palpably.\n\nFor two days, he talked to her, continued the discussions of art, of\nlife, in which they both found such pleasure. They praised the by-gone\nthings, they took a sentimental, childish delight in the achieved\nperfections of the past. Particularly they liked the late eighteenth\ncentury, the period of Goethe and of Shelley, and Mozart.\n\nThey played with the past, and with the great figures of the past, a\nsort of little game of chess, or marionettes, all to please themselves.\nThey had all the great men for their marionettes, and they two were the\nGod of the show, working it all. As for the future, that they never\nmentioned except one laughed out some mocking dream of the destruction\nof the world by a ridiculous catastrophe of man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s invention: a man\ninvented such a perfect explosive that it blew the earth in two, and\nthe two halves set off in different directions through space, to the\ndismay of the inhabitants: or else the people of the world divided into\ntwo halves, and each half decided _it_ was perfect and right, the other\nhalf was wrong and must be destroyed; so another end of the world. Or\nelse, Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dream of fear, the world went cold, and snow fell\neverywhere, and only white creatures, polar-bears, white foxes, and men\nlike awful white snow-birds, persisted in ice cruelty.\n\nApart from these stories, they never talked of the future. They\ndelighted most either in mocking imaginations of destruction, or in\nsentimental, fine marionette-shows of the past. It was a sentimental\ndelight to reconstruct the world of Goethe at Weimar, or of Schiller\nand poverty and faithful love, or to see again Jean Jacques in his\nquakings, or Voltaire at Ferney, or Frederick the Great reading his own\npoetry.\n\nThey talked together for hours, of literature and sculpture and\npainting, amusing themselves with Flaxman and Blake and Fuseli, with\ntenderness, and with Feuerbach and B\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00b6cklin. It would take them a\nlife-time, they felt to live again, _in petto_, the lives of the great\nartists. But they preferred to stay in the eighteenth and the\nnineteenth centuries.\n\nThey talked in a mixture of languages. The ground-work was French, in\neither case. But he ended most of his sentences in a stumble of English\nand a conclusion of German, she skilfully wove herself to her end in\nwhatever phrase came to her. She took a peculiar delight in this\nconversation. It was full of odd, fantastic expression, of double\nmeanings, of evasions, of suggestive vagueness. It was a real physical\npleasure to her to make this thread of conversation out of the\ndifferent-coloured strands of three languages.\n\nAnd all the while they two were hovering, hesitating round the flame of\nsome invisible declaration. He wanted it, but was held back by some\ninevitable reluctance. She wanted it also, but she wanted to put it\noff, to put it off indefinitely, she still had some pity for Gerald,\nsome connection with him. And the most fatal of all, she had the\nreminiscent sentimental compassion for herself in connection with him.\nBecause of what _had_ been, she felt herself held to him by immortal,\ninvisible threads\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094because of what _had_ been, because of his coming to\nher that first night, into her own house, in his extremity, because\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\n\nGerald was gradually overcome with a revulsion of loathing for Loerke.\nHe did not take the man seriously, he despised him merely, except as he\nfelt in Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s veins the influence of the little creature. It was\nthis that drove Gerald wild, the feeling in Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s veins of Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\npresence, Loerke\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s being, flowing dominant through her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat makes you so smitten with that little vermin?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked, really\npuzzled. For he, man-like, could not see anything attractive or\nimportant _at all_ in Loerke. Gerald expected to find some handsomeness\nor nobleness, to account for a woman\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s subjection. But he saw none\nhere, only an insect-like repulsiveness.\n\nGudrun flushed deeply. It was these attacks she would never forgive.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cMy God, what a mercy I am _not_\nmarried to you!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHer voice of flouting and contempt scotched him. He was brought up\nshort. But he recovered himself.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTell me, only tell me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he reiterated in a dangerous narrowed\nvoice\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ctell me what it is that fascinates you in him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am not fascinated,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with cold repelling innocence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes, you are. You are fascinated by that little dry snake, like a bird\ngaping ready to fall down its throat.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him with black fury.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t choose to be discussed by you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t matter whether you choose or not,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat\ndoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t alter the fact that you are ready to fall down and kiss the\nfeet of that little insect. And I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want to prevent you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094do it, fall\ndown and kiss his feet. But I want to know, what it is that fascinates\nyou\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094what is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe was silent, suffused with black rage.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHow _dare_ you come brow-beating me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009chow dare you, you\nlittle squire, you bully. What right have you over me, do you think?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHis face was white and gleaming, she knew by the light in his eyes that\nshe was in his power\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the wolf. And because she was in his power, she\nhated him with a power that she wondered did not kill him. In her will\nshe killed him as he stood, effaced him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is not a question of right,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gerald, sitting down on a chair.\nShe watched the change in his body. She saw his clenched, mechanical\nbody moving there like an obsession. Her hatred of him was tinged with\nfatal contempt.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not a question of my right over you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094though I _have_ some right,\nremember. I want to know, I only want to know what it is that\nsubjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs, what it is\nthat brings you down like a humble maggot, in worship of him. I want to\nknow what you creep after.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe stood over against the window, listening. Then she turned round.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, in her most easy, most cutting voice. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you want\nto know what it is in him? It\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s because he has some understanding of a\nwoman, because he is not stupid. That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s why it is.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA queer, sinister, animal-like smile came over Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut what understanding is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe understanding of a flea,\na hopping flea with a proboscis. Why should you crawl abject before the\nunderstanding of a flea?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere passed through Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s mind Blake\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s representation of the soul\nof a flea. She wanted to fit it to Loerke. Blake was a clown too. But\nit was necessary to answer Gerald.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDon\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you think the understanding of a flea is more interesting than\nthe understanding of a fool?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA fool!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he repeated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA fool, a conceited fool\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a _Dummkopf_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, adding the German\nword.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you call me a fool?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell, wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t I rather be the\nfool I am, than that flea downstairs?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe looked at him. A certain blunt, blind stupidity in him palled on\nher soul, limiting her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou give yourself away by that last,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe sat and wondered.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall go away soon,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe turned on him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRemember,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI am completely independent of you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094completely.\nYou make your arrangements, I make mine.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe pondered this.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou mean we are strangers from this minute?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\nShe halted and flushed. He was putting her in a trap, forcing her hand.\nShe turned round on him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cStrangers,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe can never be. But if you _want_ to make any\nmovement apart from me, then I wish you to know you are perfectly free\nto do so. Do not consider me in the slightest.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nEven so slight an implication that she needed him and was depending on\nhim still was sufficient to rouse his passion. As he sat a change came\nover his body, the hot, molten stream mounted involuntarily through his\nveins. He groaned inwardly, under its bondage, but he loved it. He\nlooked at her with clear eyes, waiting for her.\n\nShe knew at once, and was shaken with cold revulsion. _How_ could he\nlook at her with those clear, warm, waiting eyes, waiting for her, even\nnow? What had been said between them, was it not enough to put them\nworlds asunder, to freeze them forever apart! And yet he was all\ntransfused and roused, waiting for her.\n\nIt confused her. Turning her head aside, she said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall always _tell_ you, whenever I am going to make any change\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd with this she moved out of the room.\n\nHe sat suspended in a fine recoil of disappointment, that seemed\ngradually to be destroying his understanding. But the unconscious state\nof patience persisted in him. He remained motionless, without thought\nor knowledge, for a long time. Then he rose, and went downstairs, to\nplay at chess with one of the students. His face was open and clear,\nwith a certain innocent _laisser-aller_ that troubled Gudrun most, made\nher almost afraid of him, whilst she disliked him deeply for it.\n\nIt was after this that Loerke, who had never yet spoken to her\npersonally, began to ask her of her state.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are not married at all, are you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\nShe looked full at him.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNot in the least,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, in her measured way. Loerke laughed,\nwrinkling up his face oddly. There was a thin wisp of his hair straying\non his forehead, she noticed that his skin was of a clear brown colour,\nhis hands, his wrists. And his hands seemed closely prehensile. He\nseemed like topaz, so strangely brownish and pellucid.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGood,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nStill it needed some courage for him to go on.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas Mrs Birkin your sister?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd was _she_ married?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShe was married.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you parents, then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwe have parents.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she told him, briefly, laconically, her position.

Why deny it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094why make any question of it? You are\nan extraordinary woman, why should you follow the ordinary course, the\nordinary life?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun sat looking at her hands, flushed. She was pleased that he said,\nso simply, that she was a remarkable woman. He would not say that to\nflatter her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he was far too self-opinionated and objective by nature. He\nsaid it as he would say a piece of sculpture was remarkable, because he\nknew it was so.\n\nAnd it gratified her to hear it from him. Other people had such a\npassion to make everything of one degree, of one pattern. In England it\nwas chic to be perfectly ordinary. And it was a relief to her to be\nacknowledged extraordinary. Then she need not fret about the common\nstandards.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou see,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have no money whatsoever.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAch, money!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he cried, lifting his shoulders. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhen one is grown up,\nmoney is lying about at one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s service.

It is the understanding that matters.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked up at her almost frightened, furtive. Then he nodded, a\nlittle sullenly. She let go his hand: he had made not the lightest\nresponse.

She was\nterribly susceptible to these evil prognostications, but he only shook\nhis head.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGerald did not come in from his skiing until nightfall, he missed the\ncoffee and cake that she took at four o\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099clock. The snow was in perfect\ncondition, he had travelled a long way, by himself, among the snow\nridges, on his skis, he had climbed high, so high that he could see\nover the top of the pass, five miles distant, could see the\nMarienh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bctte, the hostel on the crest of the pass, half buried in snow,\nand over into the deep valley beyond, to the dusk of the pine trees.\nOne could go that way home; but he shuddered with nausea at the thought\nof home;\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094one could travel on skis down there, and come to the old\nimperial road, below the pass. But why come to any road? He revolted at\nthe thought of finding himself in the world again. He must stay up\nthere in the snow forever. He had been happy by himself, high up there\nalone, travelling swiftly on skis, taking far flights, and skimming\npast the dark rocks veined with brilliant snow.\n\nBut he felt something icy gathering at his heart. This strange mood of\npatience and innocence which had persisted in him for some days, was\npassing away, he would be left again a prey to the horrible passions\nand tortures.\n\nSo he came down reluctantly, snow-burned, snow-estranged, to the house\nin the hollow, between the knuckles of the mountain tops. He saw its\nlights shining yellow, and he held back, wishing he need not go in, to\nconfront those people, to hear the turmoil of voices and to feel the\nconfusion of other presences. He was isolated as if there were a vacuum\nround his heart, or a sheath of pure ice.\n\nThe moment he saw Gudrun something jolted in his soul. She was looking\nrather lofty and superb, smiling slowly and graciously to the Germans.\nA sudden desire leapt in his heart, to kill her. He thought, what a\nperfect voluptuous fulfilment it would be, to kill her. His mind was\nabsent all the evening, estranged by the snow and his passion. But he\nkept the idea constant within him, what a perfect voluptuous\nconsummation it would be to strangle her, to strangle every spark of\nlife out of her, till she lay completely inert, soft, relaxed for ever,\na soft heap lying dead between his hands, utterly dead. Then he would\nhave had her finally and for ever; there would be such a perfect\nvoluptuous finality.\n\nGudrun was unaware of what he was feeling, he seemed so quiet and\namiable, as usual. His amiability even made her feel brutal towards\nhim.\n\nShe went into his room when he was partially undressed. She did not\nnotice the curious, glad gleam of pure hatred, with which he looked at\nher. She stood near the door, with her hand behind her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have been thinking, Gerald,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with an insulting\nnonchalance, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthat I shall not go back to England.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhere will you go then?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut she ignored his question. She had her own logical statement to\nmake, and it must be made as she had thought it.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see the use of going back,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she continued. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt is over between\nme and you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe paused for him to speak. But he said nothing. He was only talking\nto himself, saying \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOver, is it? I believe it is over. But it isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t\nfinished.

There must be a conclusion, there must be finality.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nSo he talked to himself, but aloud he said nothing whatever.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat has been, has been,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she continued. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere is nothing that I\nregret.

Then neither of us cherishes any\nregrets, which is as it should be.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cQuite as it should be,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said aimlessly.\n\nShe paused to gather up her thread again.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOur attempt has been a failure,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut we can try again,\nelsewhere.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA little flicker of rage ran through his blood.

There is only this\nleft, for me to kill her.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d A heavy, overcharged desire to bring about\nher death possessed him. She was unaware.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cDo you think it has been a success?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAgain the insult of the flippant question ran through his blood like a\ncurrent of fire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt had some of the elements of success, our relationship,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he replied.\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094might have come off.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut he paused before concluding the last phrase. Even as he began the\nsentence, he did not believe in what he was going to say. He knew it\nnever could have been a success.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou cannot love.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAnd you?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\nHer wide, dark-filled eyes were fixed on him, like two moons of\ndarkness.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t love _you_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, with stark cold truth.\n\nA blinding flash went over his brain, his body jolted. His heart had\nburst into flame. His consciousness was gone into his wrists, into his\nhands. He was one blind, incontinent desire, to kill her. His wrists\nwere bursting, there would be no satisfaction till his hands had closed\non her.\n\nBut even before his body swerved forward on her, a sudden, cunning\ncomprehension was expressed on her face, and in a flash she was out of\nthe door. She ran in one flash to her room and locked herself in. She\nwas afraid, but confident. She knew her life trembled on the edge of an\nabyss. But she was curiously sure of her footing. She knew her cunning\ncould outwit him.\n\nShe trembled, as she stood in her room, with excitement and awful\nexhilaration. She knew she could outwit him. She could depend on her\npresence of mind, and on her wits. But it was a fight to the death, she\nknew it now. One slip, and she was lost. She had a strange, tense,\nexhilarated sickness in her body, as one who is in peril of falling\nfrom a great height, but who does not look down, does not admit the\nfear.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI will go away the day after tomorrow,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nShe only did not want Gerald to think that she was afraid of him, that\nshe was running away because she was afraid of him. She was not afraid\nof him, fundamentally. She knew it was her safeguard to avoid his\nphysical violence. But even physically she was not afraid of him. She\nwanted to prove it to him. When she had proved it, that, whatever he\nwas, she was not afraid of him; when she had proved _that_, she could\nleave him forever. But meanwhile the fight between them, terrible as\nshe knew it to be, was inconclusive. And she wanted to be confident in\nherself. However many terrors she might have, she would be unafraid,\nuncowed by him. He could never cow her, nor dominate her, nor have any\nright over her; this she would maintain until she had proved it. Once\nit was proved, she was free of him forever.\n\nBut she had not proved it yet, neither to him nor to herself. And this\nwas what still bound her to him. She was bound to him, she could not\nlive beyond him. She sat up in bed, closely wrapped up, for many hours,\nthinking endlessly to herself. It was as if she would never have done\nweaving the great provision of her thoughts.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t as if he really loved me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said to herself. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t.\nEvery woman he comes across he wants to make her in love with him. He\ndoesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t even know that he is doing it. But there he is, before every\nwoman he unfurls his male attractiveness, displays his great\ndesirability, he tries to make every woman think how wonderful it would\nbe to have him for a lover. His very ignoring of the women is part of\nthe game. He is never _unconscious_ of them. He should have been a\ncockerel, so he could strut before fifty females, all his subjects. But\nreally, his Don Juan does _not_ interest me. I could play Dona Juanita\na million times better than he plays Juan. He bores me, you know. His\nmaleness bores me. Nothing is so boring, so inherently stupid and\nstupidly conceited. Really, the fathomless conceit of these men, it is\nridiculous\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the little strutters.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey are all alike. Look at Birkin. Built out of the limitation of\nconceit they are, and nothing else. Really, nothing but their\nridiculous limitation and intrinsic insignificance could make them so\nconceited.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAs for Loerke, there is a thousand times more in him than in a Gerald.\nGerald is so limited, there is a dead end to him. He would grind on at\nthe old mills forever. And really, there is no corn between the\nmillstones any more. They grind on and on, when there is nothing to\ngrind\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094saying the same things, believing the same things, acting the\nsame things. Oh, my God, it would wear out the patience of a stone.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t worship Loerke, but at any rate, he is a free individual. He\nis not stiff with conceit of his own maleness. He is not grinding\ndutifully at the old mills. Oh God, when I think of Gerald, and his\nwork\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094those offices at Beldover, and the mines\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it makes my heart sick.\nWhat _have_ I to do with it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and him thinking he can be a lover to a\nwoman! One might as well ask it of a self-satisfied lamp-post. These\nmen, with their eternal jobs\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094and their eternal mills of God that keep\non grinding at nothing! It is too boring, just boring. However did I\ncome to take him seriously at all!\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAt least in Dresden, one will have one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s back to it all. And there\nwill be amusing things to do. It will be amusing to go to these\neurythmic displays, and the German opera, the German theatre. It _will_\nbe amusing to take part in German Bohemian life. And Loerke is an\nartist, he is a free individual. One will escape from so much, that is\nthe chief thing, escape so much hideous boring repetition of vulgar\nactions, vulgar phrases, vulgar postures. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t delude myself that I\nshall find an elixir of life in Dresden. I know I shan\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t. But I shall\nget away from people who have their own homes and their own children\nand their own acquaintances and their own this and their own that. I\nshall be among people who _don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ own things and who _haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t_ got a\nhome and a domestic servant in the background, who haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t got a\nstanding and a status and a degree and a circle of friends of the same.\nOh God, the wheels within wheels of people, it makes one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s head tick\nlike a clock, with a very madness of dead mechanical monotony and\nmeaninglessness. How I _hate_ life, how I hate it. How I hate the\nGeralds, that they can offer one nothing else.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cShortlands!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Heavens! Think of living there, one week, then the next,\nand _then the third_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo, I won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t think of it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it is too much\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nAnd she broke off, really terrified, really unable to bear any more.\n\nThe thought of the mechanical succession of day following day, day\nfollowing day, _ad infintum_, was one of the things that made her heart\npalpitate with a real approach of madness. The terrible bondage of this\ntick-tack of time, this twitching of the hands of the clock, this\neternal repetition of hours and days\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094oh God, it was too awful to\ncontemplate. And there was no escape from it, no escape.\n\nShe almost wished Gerald were with her to save her from the terror of\nher own thoughts. Oh, how she suffered, lying there alone, confronted\nby the terrible clock, with its eternal tick-tack. All life, all life\nresolved itself into this: tick-tack, tick-tack, tick-tack; then the\nstriking of the hour; then the tick-tack, tick-tack, and the twitching\nof the clock-fingers.\n\nGerald could not save her from it. He, his body, his motion, his\nlife\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was the same ticking, the same twitching across the dial, a\nhorrible mechanical twitching forward over the face of the hours. What\nwere his kisses, his embraces. She could hear their tick-tack,\ntick-tack.\n\nHa\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she laughed to herself, so frightened that she was trying to\nlaugh it off\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ha, how maddening it was, to be sure, to be sure!\n\nThen, with a fleeting self-conscious motion, she wondered if she would\nbe very much surprised, on rising in the morning, to realise that her\nhair had turned white. She had _felt_ it turning white so often, under\nthe intolerable burden of her thoughts, und her sensations. Yet there\nit remained, brown as ever, and there she was herself, looking a\npicture of health.\n\nPerhaps she was healthy. Perhaps it was only her unabateable health\nthat left her so exposed to the truth. If she were sickly she would\nhave her illusions, imaginations. As it was, there was no escape. She\nmust always see and know and never escape. She could never escape.\nThere she was, placed before the clock-face of life. And if she turned\nround as in a railway station, to look at the bookstall, still she\ncould see, with her very spine, she could see the clock, always the\ngreat white clock-face. In vain she fluttered the leaves of books, or\nmade statuettes in clay. She knew she was not _really_ reading. She was\nnot _really_ working. She was watching the fingers twitch across the\neternal, mechanical, monotonous clock-face of time. She never really\nlived, she only watched. Indeed, she was like a little, twelve-hour\nclock, vis-\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0-vis with the enormous clock of eternity\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there she was,\nlike Dignity and Impudence, or Impudence and Dignity.\n\nThe picture pleased her. Didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t her face really look like a clock\ndial\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094rather roundish and often pale, and impassive. She would have got\nup to look, in the mirror, but the thought of the sight of her own\nface, that was like a twelve-hour clock-dial, filled her with such deep\nterror, that she hastened to think of something else.\n\nOh, why wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t somebody kind to her? Why wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t there somebody who\nwould take her in their arms, and hold her to their breast, and give\nher rest, pure, deep, healing rest. Oh, why wasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t there somebody to\ntake her in their arms and fold her safe and perfect, for sleep. She\nwanted so much this perfect enfolded sleep. She lay always so\nunsheathed in sleep. She would lie always unsheathed in sleep,\nunrelieved, unsaved. Oh, how could she bear it, this endless unrelief,\nthis eternal unrelief.\n\nGerald! Could he fold her in his arms and sheathe her in sleep? Ha! He\nneeded putting to sleep himself\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094poor Gerald. That was all he needed.\nWhat did he do, he made the burden for her greater, the burden of her\nsleep was the more intolerable, when he was there. He was an added\nweariness upon her unripening nights, her unfruitful slumbers. Perhaps\nhe got some repose from her. Perhaps he did. Perhaps this was what he\nwas always dogging her for, like a child that is famished, crying for\nthe breast. Perhaps this was the secret of his passion, his forever\nunquenched desire for her\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that he needed her to put him to sleep, to\ngive him repose.\n\nWhat then! Was she his mother? Had she asked for a child, whom she must\nnurse through the nights, for her lover. She despised him, she despised\nhim, she hardened her heart. An infant crying in the night, this Don\nJuan.\n\nOoh, but how she hated the infant crying in the night. She would murder\nit gladly. She would stifle it and bury it, as Hetty Sorrell did. No\ndoubt Hetty Sorrell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s infant cried in the night\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094no doubt Arthur\nDonnithorne\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s infant would. Ha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the Arthur Donnithornes, the Geralds of\nthis world. So manly by day, yet all the while, such a crying of\ninfants in the night. Let them turn into mechanisms, let them. Let them\nbecome instruments, pure machines, pure wills, that work like\nclock-work, in perpetual repetition. Let them be this, let them be\ntaken up entirely in their work, let them be perfect parts of a great\nmachine, having a slumber of constant repetition. Let Gerald manage his\nfirm. There he would be satisfied, as satisfied as a wheelbarrow that\ngoes backwards and forwards along a plank all day\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094she had seen it.\n\nThe wheel-barrow\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the one humble wheel\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094the unit of the firm. Then the\ncart, with two wheels; then the truck, with four; then the\ndonkey-engine, with eight, then the winding-engine, with sixteen, and\nso on, till it came to the miner, with a thousand wheels, and then the\nelectrician, with three thousand, and the underground manager, with\ntwenty thousand, and the general manager with a hundred thousand little\nwheels working away to complete his make-up, and then Gerald, with a\nmillion wheels and cogs and axles.\n\nPoor Gerald, such a lot of little wheels to his make-up! He was more\nintricate than a chronometer-watch. But oh heavens, what weariness!\nWhat weariness, God above! A chronometer-watch\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094a beetle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094her soul\nfainted with utter ennui, from the thought. So many wheels to count and\nconsider and calculate! Enough, enough\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094there was an end to man\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\ncapacity for complications, even. Or perhaps there was no end.\n\nMeanwhile Gerald sat in his room, reading. When Gudrun was gone, he was\nleft stupefied with arrested desire. He sat on the side of the bed for\nan hour, stupefied, little strands of consciousness appearing and\nreappearing. But he did not move, for a long time he remained inert,\nhis head dropped on his breast.\n\nThen he looked up and realised that he was going to bed. He was cold.\nSoon he was lying down in the dark.\n\nBut what he could not bear was the darkness. The solid darkness\nconfronting him drove him mad. So he rose, and made a light. He\nremained seated for a while, staring in front. He did not think of\nGudrun, he did not think of anything.\n\nThen suddenly he went downstairs for a book. He had all his life been\nin terror of the nights that should come, when he could not sleep. He\nknew that this would be too much for him, to have to face nights of\nsleeplessness and of horrified watching the hours.\n\nSo he sat for hours in bed, like a statue, reading. His mind, hard and\nacute, read on rapidly, his body understood nothing. In a state of\nrigid unconsciousness, he read on through the night, till morning,\nwhen, weary and disgusted in spirit, disgusted most of all with\nhimself, he slept for two hours.\n\nThen he got up, hard and full of energy. Gudrun scarcely spoke to him,\nexcept at coffee when she said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI shall be leaving tomorrow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe will go together as far as Innsbruck, for appearance\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s sake?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\nasked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cPerhaps,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nShe said \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Perhaps\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 between the sips of her coffee. And the sound of her\ntaking her breath in the word, was nauseous to him. He rose quickly to\nbe away from her.\n\nHe went and made arrangements for the departure on the morrow. Then,\ntaking some food, he set out for the day on the skis. Perhaps, he said\nto the Wirt, he would go up to the Marienh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bctte, perhaps to the village\nbelow.\n\nTo Gudrun this day was full of a promise like spring. She felt an\napproaching release, a new fountain of life rising up in her. It gave\nher pleasure to dawdle through her packing, it gave her pleasure to dip\ninto books, to try on her different garments, to look at herself in the\nglass. She felt a new lease of life was come upon her, and she was\nhappy like a child, very attractive and beautiful to everybody, with\nher soft, luxuriant figure, and her happiness. Yet underneath was death\nitself.\n\nIn the afternoon she had to go out with Loerke. Her tomorrow was\nperfectly vague before her. This was what gave her pleasure. She might\nbe going to England with Gerald, she might be going to Dresden with\nLoerke, she might be going to Munich, to a girl-friend she had there.\nAnything might come to pass on the morrow. And today was the white,\nsnowy iridescent threshold of all possibility. All possibility\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that was\nthe charm to her, the lovely, iridescent, indefinite charm,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094pure\nillusion. All possibility\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094because death was inevitable, and _nothing_\nwas possible but death.\n\nShe did not want things to materialise, to take any definite shape. She\nwanted, suddenly, at one moment of the journey tomorrow, to be wafted\ninto an utterly new course, by some utterly unforeseen event, or\nmotion. So that, although she wanted to go out with Loerke for the last\ntime into the snow, she did not want to be serious or businesslike.\n\nAnd Loerke was not a serious figure. In his brown velvet cap, that made\nhis head as round as a chestnut, with the brown-velvet flaps loose and\nwild over his ears, and a wisp of elf-like, thin black hair blowing\nabove his full, elf-like dark eyes, the shiny, transparent brown skin\ncrinkling up into odd grimaces on his small-featured face, he looked an\nodd little boy-man, a bat. But in his figure, in the greeny loden suit,\nhe looked _ch\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9tif_ and puny, still strangely different from the rest.\n\nHe had taken a little toboggan, for the two of them, and they trudged\nbetween the blinding slopes of snow, that burned their now hardening\nfaces, laughing in an endless sequence of quips and jests and polyglot\nfancies. The fancies were the reality to both of them, they were both\nso happy, tossing about the little coloured balls of verbal humour and\nwhimsicality. Their natures seemed to sparkle in full interplay, they\nwere enjoying a pure game. And they wanted to keep it on the level of a\ngame, their relationship: _such_ a fine game.\n\nLoerke did not take the toboganning very seriously. He put no fire and\nintensity into it, as Gerald did. Which pleased Gudrun. She was weary,\noh so weary of Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gripped intensity of physical motion. Loerke\nlet the sledge go wildly, and gaily, like a flying leaf, and when, at a\nbend, he pitched both her and him out into the snow, he only waited for\nthem both to pick themselves up unhurt off the keen white ground, to be\nlaughing and pert as a pixie. She knew he would be making ironical,\nplayful remarks as he wandered in hell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094if he were in the humour. And\nthat pleased her immensely. It seemed like a rising above the\ndreariness of actuality, the monotony of contingencies.\n\nThey played till the sun went down, in pure amusement, careless and\ntimeless. Then, as the little sledge twirled riskily to rest at the\nbottom of the slope,\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWait!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said suddenly, and he produced from somewhere a large\nthermos flask, a packet of Keks, and a bottle of Schnapps.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh Loerke,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat an inspiration! What a _comble de joie\nindeed!_ What is the Schnapps?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at it, and laughed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Heidelbeer!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNo! From the bilberries under the snow. Doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it look as if it were\ndistilled from snow. Can you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she sniffed, and sniffed at the\nbottle\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ccan you smell bilberries? Isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t it wonderful? It is exactly as\nif one could smell them through the snow.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe stamped her foot lightly on the ground. He kneeled down and\nwhistled, and put his ear to the snow. As he did so his black eyes\ntwinkled up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHa! Ha!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed, warmed by the whimsical way in which he mocked\nat her verbal extravagances. He was always teasing her, mocking her\nways. But as he in his mockery was even more absurd than she in her\nextravagances, what could one do but laugh and feel liberated.\n\nShe could feel their voices, hers and his, ringing silvery like bells\nin the frozen, motionless air of the first twilight. How perfect it\nwas, how _very_ perfect it was, this silvery isolation and interplay.\n\nShe sipped the hot coffee, whose fragrance flew around them like bees\nmurmuring around flowers, in the snowy air, she drank tiny sips of the\n_Heidelbeerwasser_, she ate the cold, sweet, creamy wafers. How good\neverything was! How perfect everything tasted and smelled and sounded,\nhere in this utter stillness of snow and falling twilight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou are going away tomorrow?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d his voice came at last.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a pause, when the evening seemed to rise in its silent,\nringing pallor infinitely high, to the infinite which was near at hand.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Wohin?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThat was the question\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094_wohin?_ Whither? _Wohin?_ What a lovely word!\nShe _never_ wanted it answered. Let it chime for ever.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, smiling at him.\n\nHe caught the smile from her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne never does,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne never does,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated.\n\nThere was a silence, wherein he ate biscuits rapidly, as a rabbit eats\nleaves.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he laughed, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cwhere will you take a ticket to?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOh heaven!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne must take a ticket.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHere was a blow. She saw herself at the wicket, at the railway station.\nThen a relieving thought came to her. She breathed freely.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut one needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cCertainly not,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI mean one needn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t go where one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s ticket says.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThat struck him. One might take a ticket, so as not to travel to the\ndestination it indicated. One might break off, and avoid the\ndestination. A point located. That was an idea!\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThen take a ticket to London,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cOne should never go there.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cRight,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she answered.\n\nHe poured a little coffee into a tin can.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYou won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t tell me where you will go?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cReally and truly,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t know. It depends which way the\nwind blows.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked at her quizzically, then he pursed up his lips, like\nZephyrus, blowing across the snow.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt goes towards Germany,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI believe so,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she laughed.\n\nSuddenly, they were aware of a vague white figure near them. It was\nGerald. Gudrun\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart leapt in sudden terror, profound terror. She\nrose to her feet.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey told me where you were,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d came Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s voice, like a judgment in\nthe whitish air of twilight.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Maria!_ You come like a ghost,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d exclaimed Loerke.\n\nGerald did not answer. His presence was unnatural and ghostly to them.\n\nLoerke shook the flask\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then he held it inverted over the snow. Only a\nfew brown drops trickled out.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAll gone!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nTo Gerald, the smallish, odd figure of the German was distinct and\nobjective, as if seen through field glasses. And he disliked the small\nfigure exceedingly, he wanted it removed.\n\nThen Loerke rattled the box which held the biscuits.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBiscuits there are still,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nAnd reaching from his seated posture in the sledge, he handed them to\nGudrun. She fumbled, and took one. He would have held them to Gerald,\nbut Gerald so definitely did not want to be offered a biscuit, that\nLoerke, rather vaguely, put the box aside. Then he took up the small\nbottle, and held it to the light.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cAlso there is some Schnapps,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said to himself.\n\nThen suddenly, he elevated the battle gallantly in the air, a strange,\ngrotesque figure leaning towards Gudrun, and said:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Gn\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4diges Fr\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a4ulein_,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_wohl_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThere was a crack, the bottle was flying, Loerke had started back, the\nthree stood quivering in violent emotion.\n\nLoerke turned to Gerald, a devilish leer on his bright-skinned face.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWell done!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in a satirical demoniac frenzy. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_C\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099est le sport,\nsans doute._\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nThe next instant he was sitting ludicrously in the snow, Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s fist\nhaving rung against the side of his head. But Loerke pulled himself\ntogether, rose, quivering, looking full at Gerald, his body weak and\nfurtive, but his eyes demoniacal with satire.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Vive le h\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9ros, vive_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut he flinched, as, in a black flash Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s fist came upon him,\nbanged into the other side of his head, and sent him aside like a\nbroken straw.\n\nBut Gudrun moved forward. She raised her clenched hand high, and\nbrought it down, with a great downward stroke on to the face and on to\nthe breast of Gerald.\n\nA great astonishment burst upon him, as if the air had broken. Wide,\nwide his soul opened, in wonder, feeling the pain. Then it laughed,\nturning, with strong hands outstretched, at last to take the apple of\nhis desire. At last he could finish his desire.\n\nHe took the throat of Gudrun between his hands, that were hard and\nindomitably powerful. And her throat was beautifully, so beautifully\nsoft, save that, within, he could feel the slippery chords of her life.\nAnd this he crushed, this he could crush. What bliss! Oh what bliss, at\nlast, what satisfaction, at last! The pure zest of satisfaction filled\nhis soul. He was watching the unconsciousness come unto her swollen\nface, watching the eyes roll back. How ugly she was! What a fulfilment,\nwhat a satisfaction! How good this was, oh how good it was, what a\nGod-given gratification, at last! He was unconscious of her fighting\nand struggling. The struggling was her reciprocal lustful passion in\nthis embrace, the more violent it became, the greater the frenzy of\ndelight, till the zenith was reached, the crisis, the struggle was\noverborne, her movement became softer, appeased.\n\nLoerke roused himself on the snow, too dazed and hurt to get up. Only\nhis eyes were conscious.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Monsieur!_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, in his thin, roused voice: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Quand vous aurez\nfini_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nA revulsion of contempt and disgust came over Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soul. The\ndisgust went to the very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, what was he\ndoing, to what depths was he letting himself go! As if he cared about\nher enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands!\n\nA weakness ran over his body, a terrible relaxing, a thaw, a decay of\nstrength. Without knowing, he had let go his grip, and Gudrun had\nfallen to her knees. Must he see, must he know?\n\nA fearful weakness possessed him, his joints were turned to water. He\ndrifted, as on a wind, veered, and went drifting away.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want it, really,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d was the last confession of disgust in his\nsoul, as he drifted up the slope, weak, finished, only sheering off\nunconsciously from any further contact. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve had enough\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I want to go\nto sleep. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve had enough.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d He was sunk under a sense of nausea.\n\nHe was weak, but he did not want to rest, he wanted to go on and on, to\nthe end. Never again to stay, till he came to the end, that was all the\ndesire that remained to him. So he drifted on and on, unconscious and\nweak, not thinking of anything, so long as he could keep in action.\n\nThe twilight spread a weird, unearthly light overhead, bluish-rose in\ncolour, the cold blue night sank on the snow. In the valley below,\nbehind, in the great bed of snow, were two small figures: Gudrun\ndropped on her knees, like one executed, and Loerke sitting propped up\nnear her. That was all.\n\nGerald stumbled on up the slope of snow, in the bluish darkness, always\nclimbing, always unconsciously climbing, weary though he was. On his\nleft was a steep slope with black rocks and fallen masses of rock and\nveins of snow slashing in and about the blackness of rock, veins of\nsnow slashing vaguely in and about the blackness of rock. Yet there was\nno sound, all this made no noise.\n\nTo add to his difficulty, a small bright moon shone brilliantly just\nahead, on the right, a painful brilliant thing that was always there,\nunremitting, from which there was no escape. He wanted so to come to\nthe end\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094he had had enough. Yet he did not sleep.\n\nHe surged painfully up, sometimes having to cross a slope of black\nrock, that was blown bare of snow. Here he was afraid of falling, very\nmuch afraid of falling. And high up here, on the crest, moved a wind\nthat almost overpowered him with a sleep-heavy iciness. Only it was not\nhere, the end, and he must still go on. His indefinite nausea would not\nlet him stay.\n\nHaving gained one ridge, he saw the vague shadow of something higher in\nfront. Always higher, always higher. He knew he was following the track\ntowards the summit of the slopes, where was the Marienh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bctte, and the\ndescent on the other side. But he was not really conscious. He only\nwanted to go on, to go on whilst he could, to move, to keep going, that\nwas all, to keep going, until it was finished. He had lost all his\nsense of place. And yet in the remaining instinct of life, his feet\nsought the track where the skis had gone.\n\nHe slithered down a sheer snow slope. That frightened him. He had no\nalpenstock, nothing. But having come safely to rest, he began to walk\non, in the illuminated darkness. It was as cold as sleep. He was\nbetween two ridges, in a hollow. So he swerved. Should he climb the\nother ridge, or wander along the hollow? How frail the thread of his\nbeing was stretched! He would perhaps climb the ridge. The snow was\nfirm and simple. He went along. There was something standing out of the\nsnow. He approached, with dimmest curiosity.\n\nIt was a half-buried Crucifix, a little Christ under a little sloping\nhood, at the top of a pole. He sheered away. Somebody was going to\nmurder him. He had a great dread of being murdered. But it was a dread\nwhich stood outside him, like his own ghost.\n\nYet why be afraid? It was bound to happen. To be murdered! He looked\nround in terror at the snow, the rocking, pale, shadowy slopes of the\nupper world. He was bound to be murdered, he could see it. This was the\nmoment when the death was uplifted, and there was no escape.\n\nLord Jesus, was it then bound to be\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094Lord Jesus! He could feel the blow\ndescending, he knew he was murdered. Vaguely wandering forward, his\nhands lifted as if to feel what would happen, he was waiting for the\nmoment when he would stop, when it would cease. It was not over yet.\n\nHe had come to the hollow basin of snow, surrounded by sheer slopes and\nprecipices, out of which rose a track that brought one to the top of\nthe mountain. But he wandered unconsciously, till he slipped and fell\ndown, and as he fell something broke in his soul, and immediately he\nwent to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\n EXEUNT\n\nWhen they brought the body home, the next morning, Gudrun was shut up\nin her room. From her window she saw men coming along with a burden,\nover the snow. She sat still and let the minutes go by.\n\nThere came a tap at her door. She opened. There stood a woman, saying\nsoftly, oh, far too reverently:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThey have found him, madam!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Il est mort?_\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094hours ago.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun did not know what to say. What should she say? What should she\nfeel? What should she do? What did they expect of her? She was coldly\nat a loss.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThank you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said, and she shut the door of her room. The woman\nwent away mortified. Not a word, not a tear\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094ha! Gudrun was cold, a cold\nwoman.\n\nGudrun sat on in her room, her face pale and impassive. What was she to\ndo? She could not weep and make a scene. She could not alter herself.\nShe sat motionless, hiding from people. Her one motive was to avoid\nactual contact with events. She only wrote out a long telegram to\nUrsula and Birkin.\n\nIn the afternoon, however, she rose suddenly to look for Loerke. She\nglanced with apprehension at the door of the room that had been\nGerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s. Not for worlds would she enter there.\n\nShe found Loerke sitting alone in the lounge. She went straight up to\nhim.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt isn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t true, is it?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe looked up at her. A small smile of misery twisted his face. He\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cTrue?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he echoed.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWe haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t killed him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she asked.\n\nHe disliked her coming to him in such a manner. He raised his shoulders\nwearily.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt has happened,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\nShe looked at him. He sat crushed and frustrated for the time being,\nquite as emotionless and barren as herself. My God! this was a barren\ntragedy, barren, barren.\n\nShe returned to her room to wait for Ursula and Birkin. She wanted to\nget away, only to get away. She could not think or feel until she had\ngot away, till she was loosed from this position.\n\nThe day passed, the next day came. She heard the sledge, saw Ursula and\nBirkin alight, and she shrank from these also.\n\nUrsula came straight up to her.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGudrun!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she cried, the tears running down her cheeks. And she took\nher sister in her arms. Gudrun hid her face on Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s shoulder, but\nstill she could not escape the cold devil of irony that froze her soul.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHa, ha!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she thought, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cthis is the right behaviour.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nBut she could not weep, and the sight of her cold, pale, impassive face\nsoon stopped the fountain of Ursula\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s tears. In a few moments, the\nsisters had nothing to say to each other.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWas it very vile to be dragged back here again?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d Gudrun asked at\nlength.\n\nUrsula looked up in some bewilderment.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI never thought of it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI felt a beast, fetching you,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Gudrun. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cBut I simply couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t see\npeople. That is too much for me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cYes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d said Ursula, chilled.\n\nBirkin tapped and entered. His face was white and expressionless. She\nknew he knew. He gave her his hand, saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThe end of _this_ trip, at any rate.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun glanced at him, afraid.\n\nThere was silence between the three of them, nothing to be said. At\nlength Ursula asked in a small voice:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you seen him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe looked back at Ursula with a hard, cold look, and did not trouble to\nanswer.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you seen him?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she repeated.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI have,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said, coldly.\n\nThen he looked at Gudrun.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHave you done anything?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cNothing,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she replied, \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cnothing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe shrank in cold disgust from making any statement.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cLoerke says that Gerald came to you, when you were sitting on the\nsledge at the bottom of the Rudelbahn, that you had words, and Gerald\nwalked away. What were the words about? I had better know, so that I\ncan satisfy the authorities, if necessary.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nGudrun looked up at him, white, childlike, mute with trouble.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cThere weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t even any words,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe knocked Loerke down and\nstunned him, he half strangled me, then he went away.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nTo herself she was saying:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cA pretty little sample of the eternal triangle!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d And she turned\nironically away, because she knew that the fight had been between\nGerald and herself and that the presence of the third party was a mere\ncontingency\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094an inevitable contingency perhaps, but a contingency none\nthe less. But let them have it as an example of the eternal triangle,\nthe trinity of hate. It would be simpler for them.\n\nBirkin went away, his manner cold and abstracted. But she knew he would\ndo things for her, nevertheless, he would see her through. She smiled\nslightly to herself, with contempt. Let him do the work, since he was\nso extremely _good_ at looking after other people.\n\nBirkin went again to Gerald. He had loved him. And yet he felt chiefly\ndisgust at the inert body lying there. It was so inert, so coldly dead,\na carcase, Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bowels seemed to turn to ice. He had to stand and\nlook at the frozen dead body that had been Gerald.\n\nIt was the frozen carcase of a dead male. Birkin remembered a rabbit\nwhich he had once found frozen like a board on the snow. It had been\nrigid like a dried board when he picked it up. And now this was Gerald,\nstiff as a board, curled up as if for sleep, yet with the horrible\nhardness somehow evident. It filled him with horror. The room must be\nmade warm, the body must be thawed. The limbs would break like glass or\nlike wood if they had to be straightened.\n\nHe reached and touched the dead face. And the sharp, heavy bruise of\nice bruised his living bowels. He wondered if he himself were freezing\ntoo, freezing from the inside. In the short blond moustache the\nlife-breath was frozen into a block of ice, beneath the silent\nnostrils. And this was Gerald!\n\nAgain he touched the sharp, almost glittering fair hair of the frozen\nbody. It was icy-cold, hair icy-cold, almost venomous. Birkin\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s heart\nbegan to freeze. He had loved Gerald. Now he looked at the shapely,\nstrange-coloured face, with the small, fine, pinched nose and the manly\ncheeks, saw it frozen like an ice-pebble\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094yet he had loved it. What was\none to think or feel? His brain was beginning to freeze, his blood was\nturning to ice-water. So cold, so cold, a heavy, bruising cold pressing\non his arms from outside, and a heavier cold congealing within him, in\nhis heart and in his bowels.\n\nHe went over the snow slopes, to see where the death had been. At last\nhe came to the great shallow among the precipices and slopes, near the\nsummit of the pass. It was a grey day, the third day of greyness and\nstillness. All was white, icy, pallid, save for the scoring of black\nrocks that jutted like roots sometimes, and sometimes were in naked\nfaces. In the distance a slope sheered down from a peak, with many\nblack rock-slides.\n\nIt was like a shallow pot lying among the stone and snow of the upper\nworld. In this pot Gerald had gone to sleep. At the far end, the guides\nhad driven iron stakes deep into the snow-wall, so that, by means of\nthe great rope attached, they could haul themselves up the massive\nsnow-front, out on to the jagged summit of the pass, naked to heaven,\nwhere the Marienh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bctte hid among the naked rocks. Round about, spiked,\nslashed snow-peaks pricked the heaven.\n\nGerald might have found this rope. He might have hauled himself up to\nthe crest. He might have heard the dogs in the Marienh\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bctte, and found\nshelter. He might have gone on, down the steep, steep fall of the\nsouth-side, down into the dark valley with its pines, on to the great\nImperial road leading south to Italy.\n\nHe might! And what then? The Imperial road! The south? Italy? What\nthen? Was it a way out? It was only a way in again. Birkin stood high\nin the painful air, looking at the peaks, and the way south. Was it any\ngood going south, to Italy? Down the old, old Imperial road?\n\nHe turned away. Either the heart would break, or cease to care. Best\ncease to care. Whatever the mystery which has brought forth man and the\nuniverse, it is a non-human mystery, it has its own great ends, man is\nnot the criterion. Best leave it all to the vast, creative, non-human\nmystery. Best strive with oneself only, not with the universe.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cGod cannot do without man.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d It was a saying of some great French\nreligious teacher. But surely this is false. God can do without man.\nGod could do without the ichthyosauri and the mastodon. These monsters\nfailed creatively to develop, so God, the creative mystery, dispensed\nwith them. In the same way the mystery could dispense with man, should\nhe too fail creatively to change and develop. The eternal creative\nmystery could dispose of man, and replace him with a finer created\nbeing. Just as the horse has taken the place of the mastodon.\n\nIt was very consoling to Birkin, to think this. If humanity ran into a\n_cul de sac_ and expended itself, the timeless creative mystery would\nbring forth some other being, finer, more wonderful, some new, more\nlovely race, to carry on the embodiment of creation. The game was never\nup. The mystery of creation was fathomless, infallible, inexhaustible,\nforever. Races came and went, species passed away, but ever new species\narose, more lovely, or equally lovely, always surpassing wonder. The\nfountain-head was incorruptible and unsearchable. It had no limits. It\ncould bring forth miracles, create utter new races and new species, in\nits own hour, new forms of consciousness, new forms of body, new units\nof being. To be man was as nothing compared to the possibilities of the\ncreative mystery. To have one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s pulse beating direct from the mystery,\nthis was perfection, unutterable satisfaction. Human or inhuman\nmattered nothing. The perfect pulse throbbed with indescribable being,\nmiraculous unborn species.\n\nBirkin went home again to Gerald. He went into the room, and sat down\non the bed. Dead, dead and cold!\n\nImperial Caesar dead, and turned to clay\nWould stop a hole to keep the wind away.\n\nThere was no response from that which had been Gerald. Strange,\ncongealed, icy substance\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094no more. No more!\n\nTerribly weary, Birkin went away, about the day\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s business. He did it\nall quietly, without bother. To rant, to rave, to be tragic, to make\nsituations\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094it was all too late. Best be quiet, and bear one\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s soul in\npatience and in fullness.\n\nBut when he went in again, at evening, to look at Gerald between the\ncandles, because of his heart\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s hunger, suddenly his heart contracted,\nhis own candle all but fell from his hand, as, with a strange\nwhimpering cry, the tears broke out. He sat down in a chair, shaken by\na sudden access. Ursula who had followed him, recoiled aghast from him,\nas he sat with sunken head and body convulsively shaken, making a\nstrange, horrible sound of tears.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want it to be like this\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094I didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t want it to be like this,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he\ncried to himself. Ursula could but think of the Kaiser\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s: \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c_Ich habe es\nnicht gewollt._\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d She looked almost with horror on Birkin.\n\nSuddenly he was silent. But he sat with his head dropped, to hide his\nface. Then furtively he wiped his face with his fingers. Then suddenly\nhe lifted his head, and looked straight at Ursula, with dark, almost\nvengeful eyes.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHe should have loved me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cI offered him.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nShe, afraid, white, with mute lips answered:\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat difference would it have made!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt would!\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt would.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d\n\nHe forgot her, and turned to look at Gerald. With head oddly lifted,\nlike a man who draws his head back from an insult, half haughtily, he\nwatched the cold, mute, material face. It had a bluish cast. It sent a\nshaft like ice through the heart of the living man. Cold, mute,\nmaterial! Birkin remembered how once Gerald had clutched his hand, with\na warm, momentaneous grip of final love. For one second\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094then let go\nagain, let go for ever. If he had kept true to that clasp, death would\nnot have mattered. Those who die, and dying still can love, still\nbelieve, do not die. They live still in the beloved. Gerald might still\nhave been living in the spirit with Birkin, even after death. He might\nhave lived with his friend, a further life.\n\nBut now he was dead, like clay, like bluish, corruptible ice. Birkin\nlooked at the pale fingers, the inert mass. He remembered a dead\nstallion he had seen: a dead mass of maleness, repugnant. He remembered\nalso the beautiful face of one whom he had loved, and who had died\nstill having the faith to yield to the mystery. That dead face was\nbeautiful, no one could call it cold, mute, material. No one could\nremember it without gaining faith in the mystery, without the soul\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s\nwarming with new, deep life-trust.\n\nAnd Gerald! The denier! He left the heart cold, frozen, hardly able to\nbeat. Gerald\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s father had looked wistful, to break the heart: but not\nthis last terrible look of cold, mute Matter. Birkin watched and\nwatched.\n\nUrsula stood aside watching the living man stare at the frozen face of\nthe dead man. Both faces were unmoved and unmoving. The candle-flames\nflickered in the frozen air, in the intense silence.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cHaven\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t you seen enough?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHe got up.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cIt\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a bitter thing to me,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d he said.\n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cWhat\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094that he\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s dead?\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d she said.\n\nHis eyes just met hers.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":239,"split":"train"}
