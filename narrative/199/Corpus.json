Dayne (i.e. Moore) went to Paris as a teenager, and almost becomes a full Parisian nearly forgetting the English language after 15 years. He sketches, with a frankness now jubilant, now cynical, the luscious \"vie de Boheme\" that Paris alone could offer the young man of health and wealth who loved art. Amid scenes splendid, squalid, or bizarre, move students, cabotins, painters, poets, pale enthusiasts starving for the sake of an idea, actresses, women of fashion, courtesans, clubmen, and spectators. Artistic endeavour and perfumed vice mingle in fraternity; everything is unusual, irregular, fantastic. Dayne emerges from the ordeal of this environment but little changed. For him the enticements of the flesh are not more powerful than those of art. One week he is beguiling the hours in some salon or alcove, the next he is incandescent with aspiration. So the years pass; and at last, having saturated himself with the French theories of literary and graphic art which are bound up with the names of Flaubert, Goncourts, Zola, Degas, and Manet, he one day learns with tragic certainty that he is not destined to be a painter, and he courageously admits that all this periodic, frenzied effort has been misdirected. Then we have interludes of philosophy and literary criticism; the philosophy perhaps not of much account; the criticism often original, epigrammatic, sometimes of an astounding penetration, and always literary. Later, Dayne is driven by adverse circumstances to London and to a lodging in the Strand, where the book ends. Dayne's ideas about art and his temperament can be seen in characteristic passages like the following: \"For art was not for us then as it is now\u00e2\u0080\u0094a mere emotion, right or wrong only in proportion to its intensity; we believed then in the grammar of art, perspective, anatomy, and la jambe qui forte.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Confessions of a Young Man, by George Moore\n\n*************************************************************\nTHERE IS AN IMPROVED HTML EDITION OF THIS TITLE WITH A LINKED\nTABLE OF CONTENTS WHICH MAY BE VIEWED AS EBOOK (# 12278) at https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/12278\n*************************************************************\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It is significant because it reveals so clearly the\nsources of that revolt. It is in a sense the history of an epoch--an epoch\nthat is just closing. It represents one of the great discoveries of English\nliterature: a discovery that had been made from time to time before, and\nthat is now being made anew in our own generation--the discovery of human\nnature.\n\nThe reason why this discovery has had to be made so often is that it shocks\npeople. They try to hush it up; and they do succeed in forgetting about it\nfor long periods of time, and pretending that it doesn't exist. They are\nshocked because human nature is not at all like the pretty pictures we like\nto draw of ourselves. It is not so sweet, amiable and gentlemanly or\nladylike as we wish to believe it. It is much more selfish, brutal and\nlascivious than we care to admit, and as such, both too terrible and too\nridiculous to please us. The Elizabethans understood human nature, and made\nglorious comedies and tragedies out of its inordinate crimes and cruelties,\nand its pathetic follies and fatuities. But people didn't like it, and they\nturned Puritan and closed the theaters. It is true, they repented, and\nopened them again; but the theater had got a bad name from which it is only\nnow beginning to recover.\n\nIn the fields of poetry and fiction a more long-drawn-out contest ensued\nbetween, those who wanted to tell the truth and those who wanted to listen\nto pleasant fibs, the latter generally having the best of it. The contest\nfinally settled down into the Victorian compromise, which was tacitly\naccepted by even the best of the imaginative writers of the period. The\nunderstanding was that brutality, lust and selfishness were to be\nrepresented as being qualities only of \"bad\" people, plainly labelled as\nsuch. Under this compromise some magnificent works were produced. But\ninasmuch as the compromise involved a suppression of a great and\nall-important fact about the human soul, it could not endure forever. The\nonly question was, under what influences would the revolt occur?\n\nIt occurred, as George Moore's quite typical and na\u00c3\u00afvely illuminating\nconfessions reveal, under French influences. Something of the same sort had\nbeen happening in France, and the English rebels found exemplars of revolt\nready to their need. These French rebels were of all sorts, and it was\nnaturally the most extreme that attracted the admiration of the English\nmalcontents. Chief among these were Gautier and Baudelaire.\n\nGautier had written in \"Mademoiselle de Maupin\" a lyrical exaltation of the\njoys of the flesh: he had eloquently and unreservedly pronounced the\nfleshly pleasures _good_. Baudelaire had gone farther: he had said\nthat Evil was beautiful, the most beautiful thing in the world--and proved\nit, to those who were anxious to believe it, by writing beautiful poems\nabout every form of evil that he could think of.\n\nThey were still far, it will be observed, from the sane and truly\nrevolutionary conception of life which has begun to obtain acceptance in\nour day--a conception of life which traverses the old conceptions if \"good\"\nand \"evil.\" Baudelaire and Gautier hardly did more than brilliantly\nchampion the unpopular side of a foolish argument. It may seem odd to us\ntoday that such a romantic, not to say hysterical, turning-upside-down of\ncurrent British morality could so deeply impress the best minds of the\nyounger generation in England. Its influence, when mixed with original\ngenius of a high quality, produced the \"Poems and Ballads\" of Swinburne. It\nproduced also _The Yellow Book_, a more characteristic and less happy\nresult. It produced a whole host of freaks and follies. But it did contain\na liberating idea--the idea that human nature is a subject to be dealt\nwith, not to be concealed and lied about. And, among others, George Moore\nwas set free--set free to write some of the sincerest fiction in our\nlanguage.\n\nThese \"Confessions\" reveal him in the process of revaluing the values of\nlife and art for himself. It was not an easy or a painless process.\nDestined for the army, because he wasn't apparently clever enough to go in\nfor the church or the law, he managed, with a kind of instinctive\nself-protection, to avoid learning enough even to be an officer. He turned\nfirst in this direction and then in that, in his efforts to escape. The\nrace-track furnished one diversion for his unhappy energies, books of\npoetry another. Then he met a painter who painted and loved sumptuous and\nbeautiful blondes, whereupon art and women became the new centers of his\nlife, and Paris, where both might be indulged in, his great ambition. Given\npermission and an allowance, he set off to study art in Paris--only to find\nafter much effort and heartache that he was a failure as an artist. There\nremained, however, women--and the caf\u00c3\u00a9s, with strange poets and\npersonalities to be cultivated and explored. Modelling himself after his\nnewest friend, in attire, manners and morals, he lived what might have been\non the whole an unprofitable and ordinary life, if he had not been able to\ngild it with the glamour of philosophic immoralism. Finally, because\neverybody else was writing, he too wrote--a play. Then follows a period of\ndiscovery of the newest movement in art. So impressionable is he that his\nstay of some years in Paris causes him actually to forget how to write\nEnglish prose, and when he returns to London and has to earn his living at\njournalism he has to learn his native tongue over again. Nevertheless he\nhas acquired a point of view--on women, on art, on life. He\nwrites--criticism, poetry, fiction. He is obscure, ambitious, full of\nself-esteem, that is beginning to be soured by failure. He tries to get\ninvolved in a duel with a young nobleman, just to get himself before the\npublic. Failing in that, he lives in squalid lodgings--or so they seem to a\nyoung man who has lived in Paris on a liberal allowance--and writes,\nwrites, writes, writes ... talking to his fellow lodgers, to the stupid\nservant who brings him his meals, and getting the materials for future\nbooks out of them. A candid record of these incidents, interwoven with\neloquent self-analysis, keen and valid criticism of books and pictures,\ndelightful reminiscences and furious dissertations upon morality, the whole\nstory is given a special and, for its time, a rare interest by its utter\nlack of conventional reticence. He never spares himself. He has undertaken\nquite honestly to tell the truth. He has learned from Paris not to be\nashamed of himself. And this, though he had not realized it, was what he\nhad gone to Paris to learn.\n\nHe had put himself instinctively in the way of receiving liberalizing\ninfluences. But it was, after all, an accident that he received those\ninfluences from France. He might conceivably have stayed at home and read\nTolstoi or Walt Whitman! So indeed might the whole English literary revolt\nhave taken its rise under different and perhaps happier influences. But it\nhappened as it happened. And accidents are important. The accident of\nhaving to turn to France for moral support colored the whole English\nliterary revolt. And the accident of going to Paris colored vividly the\nsuperficial layers of George Moore's soul. This book partly represents a\nflaunting of such borrowed colors. It was the fashion of the Parisian\ndiabolists to gloat over cruelty, by way of showing their superiority to\nChristian morality. The enjoyment of others' suffering was a splendid pagan\nvirtue. So George Moore kept a pet python, and cultivated paganness by\nwatching it devour rabbits alive.\n\nIt was the result of the same accident which caused him to conclude--and to\npreach at some length in this book--that art is aristocratic. It was the\nproper pagan thing to say, as he does here--\"What care I that some millions\nof wretched Israelites died under Pharaoh's lash? They died that I might\nhave the Pyramids to look on\"--and other remarks even more shocking and\njejune. It was this accident which made him write ineffable silliness in\nthis and other early volumes about \"virtue\" and \"vice,\" assume a\nman-about-town's attitude toward women, and fill pages with maudlin phrases\nabout marble, perfumes, palm-trees, blood, lingerie, and moonlight. These\nwere the follies of his teachers, to be faithfully imitated. If he had\nfirst heard the news that the body is good from Walt Whitman, or that the\nhuman soul contains lust and cruelty from Tolstoi, what canticles we should\nhave had from George Moore on the subject of democracy in life and art!\n\nDeeper down, George Moore was already wiser than his masters. He was to\nwrite of the love-life of Evelyn Innes, and the common workaday tragedy of\nEsther Waters, with a tender and profound sympathy far removed from the\nsentiments he felt obliged to profess here. This book is a young man's\nattempt to be sincere. It is the story of a soul struggling to be free from\nBritish morality. It is eloquent, beautiful, and at times rather silly. It\nis a picture of an epoch.\n\nThe result of the attempt to introduce diabolism to the English mind is\nwell known. The Island somewhat violently repudiated and denounced the\nwhole proceedings, as might have been expected. The French influence waned,\nand has now almost died out. But meanwhile another rediscovery of human\nnature (to which the work of a later Frenchman, Romain Rolland, has\ncontributed its due effect) is slowly re-creating English literature. Under\na Russian leadership less romantic than that of Gautier and less\n\"frightful\" than that of Baudelaire, with scientific support from Freud and\nJung, and with some extremely able British and American lieutenants, the\ncause of unashamedness appears to be winning its way in literature. The\nGeorge Moore of these Confessions stands to view as a reckless and\ncourageous pioneer, a bad strategist but a faithful soldier, in the\nfoolhardy, disastrous and gallant Campaign of the Nineties.\n\nFloyd Dell\n\nNew York, May 26, 1917.\n\n\n\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A YOUNG MAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nMy soul, so far as I understand it, has very kindly taken colour and form\nfrom the many various modes of life that self-will and an impetuous\ntemperament have forced me to indulge in. Therefore I may say that I am\nfree from original qualities, defects, tastes, etc. What I have I acquire,\nor, to speak more exactly, chance bestowed, and still bestows, upon me. I\ncame into the world apparently with a nature like a smooth sheet of wax,\nbearing no impress, but capable of receiving any; of being moulded into all\nshapes. Nor am I exaggerating when I say I think that I might equally have\nbeen a Pharaoh, an ostler, a pimp, an archbishop, and that in the\nfulfilment of the duties of each a certain measure of success would have\nbeen mine. I have felt the goad of many impulses, I have hunted many a\ntrail; when one scent failed another was taken up, and pursued with the\npertinacity of an instinct, rather than the fervour of a reasoned\nconviction. Sometimes, it is true, there came moments of weariness, of\ndespondency, but they were not enduring: a word spoken, a book read, or\nyielding to the attraction of environment, I was soon off in another\ndirection, forgetful of past failures. Intricate, indeed, was the labyrinth\nof my desires; all lights were followed with the same ardour, all cries\nwere eagerly responded to: they came from the right, they came from the\nleft, from every side. But one cry was more persistent, and as the years\npassed I learned to follow it with increasing vigour, and my strayings grew\nfewer and the way wider.\n\nI was eleven years old when I first heard and obeyed this cry, or, shall I\nsay, echo-augury?\n\nScene: A great family coach, drawn by two powerful country horses, lumbers\nalong a narrow Irish road. The ever recurrent signs--long ranges of blue\nmountains, the streak of bog, the rotting cabin, the flock of plover rising\nfrom the desolate water. Inside the coach there are two children. They are\nsmart, with new jackets and neckties; their faces are pale with sleep, and\nthe rolling of the coach makes them feel a little sick. It is seven o'clock\nin the morning. Opposite the children are their parents, and they are\ntalking of a novel the world is reading. Did Lady Audley murder her\nhusband? Lady Audley! What a beautiful name; and she, who is a slender,\npale, fairy-like woman, killed her husband. Such thoughts flash through the\nboy's mind; his imagination is stirred and quickened, and he begs for an\nexplanation. The coach lumbers along, it arrives at its destination, and\nLady Audley is forgotten in the delight of tearing down fruit trees and\nkilling a cat.\n\nBut when we returned home I took the first opportunity of stealing the\nnovel in question. I read it eagerly, passionately, vehemently. I read its\nsuccessor and its successor. I read until I came to a book called \"The\nDoctor's Wife\"--a lady who loved Shelley and Byron. There was magic, there\nwas revelation in the name, and Shelley became my soul's divinity. Why did\nI love Shelley? Why was I not attracted to Byron? I cannot say. Shelley!\nOh, that crystal name, and his poetry also crystalline. I must see it, I\nmust know him. Escaping from the schoolroom, I ransacked the library, and\nat last my ardour was rewarded. The book--a small pocket edition in red\nboards, no doubt long out of print--opened at the \"Sensitive Plant.\" Was I\ndisappointed? I think I had expected to understand better; but I had no\ndifficulty in assuming that I was satisfied and delighted. And henceforth\nthe little volume never left my pocket, and I read the dazzling stanzas by\nthe shores of a pale green Irish lake, comprehending little, and loving a\ngreat deal. Byron, too, was often with me, and these poets were the\nripening influence of years otherwise merely nervous and boisterous.\n\nAnd my poets were taken to school, because it pleased me to read \"Queen\nMab\" and \"Cain,\" amid the priests and ignorance of a hateful Roman Catholic\ncollege. And there my poets saved me from intellectual savagery; for I was\nincapable at that time of learning anything. What determined and\nincorrigible idleness! I used to gaze fondly on a book, holding my head\nbetween my hands, and allow my thoughts to wander far into dreams and thin\nimaginings. Neither Latin, nor Greek, nor French, nor History, nor English\ncomposition could I learn, unless, indeed, my curiosity or personal\ninterest was excited,--then I made rapid strides in that branch of\nknowledge to which my attention was directed. A mind hitherto dark seemed\nsuddenly to grow clear, and it remained clear and bright enough so long as\npassion was in me; but as it died, so the mind clouded, and recoiled to its\noriginal obtuseness. Couldn't, with wouldn't, was in my case curiously\ninvolved; nor have I in this respect ever been able to correct my natural\ntemperament. I have always remained powerless to do anything unless moved\nby a powerful desire.\n\nThe natural end to such schooldays as mine was expulsion. I was expelled\nwhen I was sixteen, for idleness and general worthlessness. I returned to a\nwild country home, where I found my father engaged in training racehorses.\nFor a nature of such intense vitality as mine, an ambition, an aspiration\nof some sort was necessary; and I now, as I have often done since, accepted\nthe first ideal to hand. In this instance it was the _stable_. I was\ngiven a hunter, I rode to hounds every week, I rode gallops every morning,\nI read the racing calendar, stud-book, latest betting, and looked forward\nwith enthusiasm to the day when I should be known as a successful\nsteeplechase rider. To ride the winner of the Liverpool seemed to me a\nfinal achievement and glory; and had not accident intervened, it is very\npossible that I might have succeeded in carrying off, if not the meditated\nhonour, something scarcely inferior, such as--alas, _eheu fugaces!_ I\ncannot now recall the name of a race of the necessary value and importance.\nAbout this time my father was elected Member of Parliament; our home was\nbroken up, and we went to London. But an ideal set up on its pedestal is\nnot easily displaced, and I persevered in my love, despite the poor\npromises London life held out for its ultimate attainment; and\nsurreptitiously I continued to nourish it with small bets made in a small\ntobacconist's. Well do I remember that shop, the oily-faced,\nsandy-whiskered proprietor, his betting-book, the cheap cigars along the\ncounter, the one-eyed nondescript who leaned his evening away against the\ncounter, and was supposed to know some one who knew Lord ----'s footman,\nand the great man often spoken of, but rarely seen--he who made \"a\ntwo-'undred pound book on the Derby\"; and the constant coming and going of\nthe cabmen--\"Half an ounce of shag, sir.\" I was then at a military tutor's\nin the Euston Road; for, in answer to my father's demand as to what\noccupation I intended to pursue, I had consented to enter the army. In my\nheart I knew that when it came to the point I should refuse--the idea of\nmilitary discipline was very repugnant, and the possibility of an anonymous\ndeath on a battlefield could not be accepted by so self-conscious a youth,\nby one so full of his own personality. I said Yes to my father, because the\nmoral courage to say No was lacking, and I put my trust in the future, as\nwell I might, for a fair prospect of idleness lay before me, and the chance\nof my passing any examination was, indeed, remote.\n\nIn London I made the acquaintance of a great blonde man, who talked\nincessantly about beautiful women, and painted them sometimes larger than\nlife, in somnolent attitudes, and luxurious tints. His studio was a welcome\ncontrast to the spitting and betting of the tobacco shop. His\npictures--Dor\u00c3\u00a9-like improvisations, devoid of skill, and, indeed, of\nartistic perception, save a certain sentiment for the grand and\nnoble--filled me with wonderment and awe. \"How jolly it would be to be a\npainter,\" I once said, quite involuntarily. \"Why, would you like to be a\npainter?\" he asked abruptly. I laughed, not suspecting that I had the\nslightest gift, as indeed was the case, but the idea remained in my mind,\nand soon after I began to make sketches in the streets and theatres. My\nattempts were not very successful, but they encouraged me to tell my father\nthat I would go to the military tutor no more, and he allowed me to enter\nthe Kensington Museum as an Art student. There, of course, I learned\nnothing, and, from a merely Art point of view, I had much better have\ncontinued my sketches in the streets; but the museum was a beautiful and\nbeneficent influence, and one that applied marvellously well to the\nbesetting danger of the moment; for in the galleries I met young men who\nspoke of other things than betting and steeplechase riding, who, I\nremember, it was clear to me then, looked to a higher ideal than mine,\nbreathed a purer atmosphere of thought than I. And then the sweet, white\npeace of antiquity! The great, calm gaze that is not sadness nor joy, but\nsomething that we know not of, which is lost to the world for ever.\n\n\"But if you want to be a painter you must go to France--France is the only\nschool of Art.\" I must again call attention to the phenomenon of\necho-augury, that is to say, words heard in an unlooked-for quarter, that,\nwithout an appeal to our reason, impel belief. France! The word rang in my\nears and gleamed in my eyes. France! All my senses sprang from sleep like a\ncrew when the man on the look-out cries, \"Land ahead!\" Instantly I knew I\nshould, that I must, go to France, that I would live there, that I would\nbecome as a Frenchman. I knew not when nor how, but I knew I should go to\nFrance....\n\nThen my father died, and I suddenly found myself heir to considerable\nproperty--some three or four thousands a year; and then I knew that I was\nfree to enjoy life as I pleased; no further trammels, no further need of\nbeing a soldier, of being anything but myself; eighteen, with life and\nFrance before me! But the spirit did not move me yet to leave home. I would\nfeel the pulse of life at home before I felt it abroad. I would hire a\nstudio. A studio--tapestries, smoke, models, conversations. But here it is\ndifficult not to convey a false impression. I fain would show my soul in\nthese pages, like a face in a pool of clear water; and although my studio\nwas in truth no more than an amusement, and a means of effectually throwing\nover all restraint, I did not view it at all in this light. My love of Art\nwas very genuine and deep-rooted; the tobacconist's betting-book was now as\nnothing, and a certain Botticelli in the National Gallery held me in\ntether. And when I look back and consider the past, I am forced to admit\nthat I might have grown up in less fortunate circumstances, for even the\nstudio, with its dissipations--and they were many--was not unserviceable;\nit developed the natural man, who educates himself, who allows his mind to\ngrow and ripen under the sun and wind of modern life, in contra-distinction\nto the University man, who is fed upon the dust of ages, and after a\nformula which has been composed to suit the requirements of the average\nhuman being.\n\nNor was my reading at this time so limited as might be expected from the\nforegoing. The study of Shelley's poetry had led me to read pretty nearly\nall the English lyric poets; Shelley's atheism had led me to read Kant,\nSpinoza, Godwin, Darwin and Mill; and these, again, in their turn,\nintroduced me to many writers and various literature. I do not think that\nat this time I cared much for novel reading. Scott seemed to me on a par\nwith Burke's speeches; that is to say, too impersonal for my very personal\ntaste. Dickens I knew by heart, and \"Bleak House\" I thought his greatest\nachievement. Thackeray left no deep impression on my mind; in no way did he\nhold my thoughts. He was not picturesque like Dickens, and I was at that\ntime curiously eager for some adequate philosophy of life, and his social\nsatire seemed very small beer indeed. I was really young. I hungered after\ngreat truths: \"Middle-march,\" \"Adam Bede,\" \"The Rise and Fall of\nRationalism,\" \"The History of Civilisation,\" were momentous events in my\nlife. But I loved life better than books, and I cultivated with care the\nacquaintance of a neighbour who had taken the Globe Theatre for the purpose\nof producing Offenbach's operas. Bouquets, stalls, rings, delighted me. I\nwas not dissipated, but I loved the abnormal. I loved to spend as much on\nscent and toilette knick-knacks as would keep a poor man's family in\naffluence for ten months; and I smiled at the fashionable sunlight in the\nPark, the dusty cavalcades; and I loved to shock my friends by bowing to\nthose whom I should not bow to; above all, the life of the theatres, that\nlife of raw gaslight, whitewashed walls, of light, doggerel verse, slangy\npolkas and waltzes, interested me beyond legitimate measure, so curious and\nunreal did it seem. I lived at home, but dined daily at a fashionable\nrestaurant; at half-past eight I was at the theatre. Nodding familiarly to\nthe doorkeeper, I passed up the long passage to the stage. Afterwards\nsupper. Cremorne and the Argyle Rooms were my favourite haunts. My mother\nsuffered, and expected ruin, for I took no trouble to conceal anything; I\nboasted of dissipations. But there was no need for fear; I was naturally\nendowed with a very clear sense indeed of self-preservation; I neither\nbetted nor drank, nor contracted debts, nor a secret marriage; from a\nworldly point of view, I was a model young man indeed; and when I returned\nhome about four in the morning, I watched the pale moon setting, and\nrepeating some verses of Shelley, I thought how I should go to Paris when I\nwas of age, and study painting.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nAt last the day came, and with several trunks and boxes full of clothes,\nbooks, and pictures, I started, accompanied by an English valet, for Paris\nand Art.\n\nWe all know the great grey and melancholy Gare du Nord, at half-past six in\nthe morning; and the miserable carriages, and the tall, haggard city. Pale,\nsloppy, yellow houses; an oppressive absence of colour; a peculiar\nbleakness in the streets. The _m\u00c3\u00a9nag\u00c3\u00a8re_ hurries down the asphalte to\nmarket; a dreadful _gar\u00c3\u00a7on de caf\u00c3\u00a9_, with a napkin tied round his\nthroat, moves about some chairs, so decrepit and so solitary that it seems\nimpossible to imagine a human being sitting there. Where are the\nBoulevards? where are the Champs \u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9es? I asked myself; and feeling bound\nto apologise for the appearance of the city, I explained to my valet that\nwe were passing through some by-streets, and returned to the study of a\nFrench vocabulary. Nevertheless, when the time came to formulate a demand\nfor rooms, hot water, and a fire, I broke down, and the proprietress of the\nhotel, who spoke English, had to be sent for.\n\nMy plans, so far as I had any, were to enter the beaux arts--Cabanel's\nstudio for preference; for I had then an intense and profound admiration\nfor that painter's work. I did not think much of the application I was told\nI should have to make at the Embassy; my thoughts were fixed on the master,\nand my one desire was to see him. To see him was easy, to speak to him was\nanother matter, and I had to wait three weeks, until I could hold a\nconversation in French. How I achieved this feat I cannot say. I never\nopened a book, I know, nor is it agreeable to think what my language must\nhave been like--like nothing ever heard under God's sky before, probably.\nIt was, however, sufficient to waste a good hour of the painter's time. I\ntold him of my artistic sympathies, what pictures I had seen of his in\nLondon, and how much pleased I was with those then in his studio. He went\nthrough the ordeal without flinching. He said he would be glad to have me\nas a pupil....\n\nBut life in the beaux arts is rough, coarse, and rowdy. The model sits only\nthree times a week: the other days we worked from the plaster cast; and to\nbe there by seven o'clock in the morning required so painful an effort of\nwill, that I glanced in terror down the dim and grey perspective of early\nrisings that awaited me; then, demoralised by the lassitude of Sunday, I\ntold my valet on Monday morning to leave the room, that I would return to\nthe beaux arts no more. I felt humiliated at my own weakness, for much hope\nhad been centred in that academy; and I knew no other. Day after day I\nwalked up and down the Boulevards, studying the photographs of the\n_salon_ pictures, and was stricken by the art of Jules Lefevre. True\nit is that I saw it was wanting in that tender grace which I am forced to\nadmit even now, saturated though I now am with the aesthetics of different\nschools, is inherent in Cabanel's work; but at the time I am writing of, my\nnature was too young and mobile to resist the conventional attractiveness\nof nude figures, indolent attitudes, long hair, slender hips and hands, and\nI accepted Jules Lefevre wholly and unconditionally. He hesitated, however,\nwhen I asked to be taken as a private pupil, but he wrote out the address\nof a studio where he gave instruction every Tuesday morning. This was even\nmore to my taste, for I had an instinctive liking for Frenchmen, and was\nanxious to see as much of them as possible.\n\nThe studio was perched high up in the Passage des Panoramas. There I found\nM. Julien, a typical meridional--the large stomach, the dark eyes, crafty\nand watchful; the seductively mendacious manner, the sensual mind. We made\nfriends at once--he consciously making use of me, I unconsciously making\nuse of him. To him my forty francs, a month's subscription, were a godsend,\nnor were my invitations to dinner and to the theatre to be disdained. I was\ncurious, odd, quaint. To be sure, it was a little tiresome to have to put\nup with a talkative person, whose knowledge of the French language had been\nacquired in three months, but the dinners were good. No doubt Julien\nreasoned so; I did not reason at all. I felt this crafty, clever man of the\nworld was necessary to me. I had never met such a man before, and all my\ncuriosity was awake. He spoke of art and literature, of the world and the\nflesh; he told me of the books he had read, he narrated thrilling incidents\nin his own life; and the moral reflections with which he sprinkled his\nconversation I thought very striking. Like every young man of twenty, I was\non the look-out for something to set up that would do duty for an ideal.\nThe world was to me, at this time, what a toy shop had been fifteen years\nbefore: everything was spick and span, and every illusion was set out\nstraight and smart in new paint and gilding. But Julien kept me at a\ndistance, and the rare occasions when he favoured me with his society only\nserved to prepare my mind for the friendship which awaited me, and which\nwas destined to absorb some years of my life.\n\nIn the studio there were some eighteen or twenty young men, and among these\nthere were some four or five from whom I could learn; and there were also\nthere some eight or nine young English girls. We sat round in a circle, and\ndrew from the model. And this reversal of all the world's opinions and\nprejudices was to me singularly delightful; I loved the sense of unreality\nthat the exceptionalness of our life in this studio conveyed. Besides, the\nwomen themselves were young and interesting, and were, therefore, one of\nthe charms of the place, giving, as they did, that sense of sex which is so\nsubtle a mental pleasure, and which is, in its outward aspect, so\ninteresting to the eye--the gowns, the hair lifted, showing the neck; the\nearrings, the sleeves open at the elbow. Though all this was very dear to\nme I did not fall in love: but he who escapes a woman's dominion generally\ncomes under the sway of some friend who ever uses a strange attractiveness,\nand fosters a sort of dependency that is not healthful or valid: and\nalthough I look back with undiminished delight on the friendship I\ncontracted about this time--a friendship which permeated and added to my\nlife--I am nevertheless forced to recognise that, however suitable it may\nhave been in my special case, in the majority of instances it would have\nproved but a shipwrecking reef, on which a young man's life would have gone\nto pieces. What saved me was the intensity of my passion for Art, and a\nmoral revolt against any action that I thought could or would definitely\ncompromise me in that direction. I was willing to stray a little from my\npath, but never further than a single step, which I could retrace when I\npleased.\n\nOne day I raised my eyes, and saw there was a new-comer in the studio; and,\nto my surprise, for he was fashionably dressed, and my experience had not\nled me to believe in the marriage of genius and well-cut cloth, he was\npainting very well indeed. His shoulders were beautiful and broad; a long\nneck, a tiny head, a narrow, thin face, and large eyes, full of\nintelligence and fascination. And although he could not have been working\nmore than an hour, he had already sketched in his figure, and with all the\nsurroundings--screens, lamps, stoves, etc. I was deeply interested. I asked\nthe young lady next me if she knew who he was. She could give me no\ninformation. But at four o'clock there was a general exodus from the\nstudio, and we adjourned to a neighbouring _caf\u00c3\u00a9_ to drink beer. The\nway led through a narrow passage, and as we stooped under an archway, the\nyoung man (Marshall was his name) spoke to me in English. Yes, we had met\nbefore; we had exchanged a few words in So-and-So's studio--the great\nblonde man, whose Dor\u00c3\u00a9-like improvisations had awakened aspiration in me.\n\nThe usual reflections on the chances of life were of course made, and then\nfollowed the inevitable \"Will you dine with me to-night?\" Marshall thought\nthe following day would suit him better, but I was very pressing. He\noffered to meet me at my hotel; or would I come with him to his rooms, and\nhe would show me some pictures--some trifles he had brought up from the\ncountry? Nothing would please me better. We got into a cab. Then every\nmoment revealed new qualities, new superiorities, in my new-found friend.\nNot only was he tall, strong, handsome, and beautifully dressed, infinitely\nbetter dressed than I, but he could talk French like a native. It was only\nnatural that he should, for he was born and had lived in Brussels all his\nlife, but the accident of birth rather stimulated than calmed my erubescent\nadmiration. He spoke of, and he was clearly on familiar terms with, the\nfashionable restaurants and actresses; he stopped at a hairdresser's to\nhave his hair curled. All this was very exciting, and a little bewildering.\nI was on the tiptoe of expectation to see his apartments; and, not to be\nutterly outdone, I alluded to my valet.\n\nHis apartments were not so grand as I expected; but when he explained that\nhe had just spent ten thousand pounds in two years, and was now living on\nsix or seven hundred francs a month, which his mother would allow him until\nhe had painted and had sold a certain series of pictures, which he\ncontemplated beginning at once, my admiration increased to wonder, and I\nexamined with awe the great fireplace which had been constructed at his\norders, and admired the iron pot which hung by a chain above an artificial\nbivouac fire. This detail will suggest the rest of the studio--the Turkey\ncarpet, the brass harem lamps, the Japanese screen, the pieces of drapery,\nthe oak chairs covered with red Utrecht velvet, the oak wardrobe that had\nbeen picked up somewhere,--a ridiculous bargain, and the inevitable bed\nwith spiral columns. There were vases filled with foreign grasses, and\npalms stood in the corners of the rooms. Marshall pulled out a few\npictures; but he paid very little heed to my compliments; and, sitting down\nat the piano, with a great deal of splashing and dashing about the keys, he\nrattled off a waltz.\n\n\"What waltz is that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, nothing; something I composed the other evening. I had a fit of the\nblues, and didn't go out. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think it beautiful; did you really compose that the other evening?\"\n\nAt this moment a knock was heard at the door, and a beautiful English girl\nentered. Marshall introduced me. With looks that see nothing, and words\nthat mean nothing, an amorous woman receives the man she finds with her\nsweetheart. But it subsequently transpired that Alice had an appointment,\nthat she was dining out. She would, however, call in the morning, and give\nhim a sitting for the portrait he was painting of her.\n\nI had hitherto worked very regularly and attentively at the studio, but now\nMarshall's society was an attraction I could not resist. For the sake of\nhis talent, which I religiously believed in, I regretted he was so idle;\nbut his dissipation was winning, and his delight was thorough, and his gay,\ndashing manner made me feel happy, and his experience opened to me new\navenues for enjoyment and knowledge of life. On my arrival in Paris I had\nvisited, in the company of my taciturn valet, the Mabille and the\nValentino, and I had dined at the Maison d'Or by myself; but now I was\ntaken to strange students' _caf\u00c3\u00a9s_, where dinners were paid for in\npictures; to a mysterious place, where a _table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te_ was held under\na tent in a back garden; and afterwards we went in great crowds to\n_Bullier_, the _Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Rouge_, or the _\u00c3\u0089lys\u00c3\u00a9e Montmartre_.\nThe clangour of the band, the unreal greenness of the foliage, the\nthronging of the dancers, and the chattering of women, whose Christian\nnames we only knew. And then the returning in open carriages rolling\nthrough the white dust beneath the immense heavy dome of the summer night,\nwhen the dusty darkness of the street is chequered by a passing glimpse of\nlight skirt or flying feather, and the moon looms like a magic lantern out\nof the sky.\n\nNow we seemed to live in fiacres and restaurants, and the afternoons were\nfilled with febrile impressions. Marshall had a friend in this street, and\nanother in that. It was only necessary for him to cry \"Stop\" to the\ncoachman, and to run up two or three flights of stairs....\n\n\"_Madame--, est-elle chez elle?_\"\n\n\"_Oui, Monsieur; si Monsieur veut se donner la peine d'entrer._\" And\nwe were shown into a handsomely furnished apartment. A lady would enter\nhurriedly, and an animated discussion was begun. I did not know French\nsufficiently well to follow the conversation, but I remember it always\ncommenced _mon cher ami_, and was plentifully sprinkled with the\nphrase _vous avez tort_. The ladies themselves had only just returned\nfrom Constantinople or Japan, and they were generally involved in\nmysterious lawsuits, or were busily engaged in prosecuting claims for\nseveral millions of francs against different foreign governments.\n\nAnd just as I had watched the chorus girls and mummers, three years ago, at\nthe Globe Theatre, now, excited by a nervous curiosity, I watched this\nworld of Parisian adventurers and lights o' love. And this craving for\nobservation of manners, this instinct for the rapid notation of gestures\nand words that epitomise a state of feeling, of attitudes that mirror forth\nthe soul, declared itself a main passion; and it grew and strengthened, to\nthe detriment of the other Art still so dear to me. With the patience of a\ncat before a mouse-hole, I watched and listened, picking one characteristic\nphrase out of hours of vain chatter, interested and amused by an angry or\nloving glance. Like the midges that fret the surface of a shadowy stream,\nthese men and women seemed to me; and though I laughed, danced, and made\nmerry with them, I was not of them. But with Marshall it was different:\nthey were my amusement, they were his necessary pleasure. And I knew of\nthis distinction that made twain our lives; and I reflected deeply upon it.\nWhy could I not live without an ever-present and acute consciousness of\nlife? Why could I not love, forgetful of the harsh ticking of the clock in\nthe perfumed silence of the chamber?\n\nAnd so my friend became to me a study, a subject for dissection. The\ngeneral attitude of his mind and its various turns, all the apparent\ncontradictions, and how they could be explained, classified, and reduced to\none primary law, were to me a constant source of thought. Our confidences\nknew no reserve. I say our confidences, because to obtain confidences it is\noften necessary to confide. All we saw, heard, read, or felt was the\nsubject of mutual confidences: the transitory emotion that a flush of\ncolour and a bit of perspective awakens, the blue tints that the sunsetting\nlends to a white dress, or the eternal verities, death and love. But,\nalthough I tested every fibre of thought and analysed every motive, I was\nvery sincere in my friendship, and very loyal in my admiration. Nor did my\nadmiration wane when I discovered that Marshall was shallow in his\nappreciations, superficial in his judgments, that his talents did not\npierce below the surface; _il avait se grand air_; there was\nfascination in his very bearing, in his large, soft, colourful eyes, and a\ngo and dash in his dissipations that carried you away.\n\nTo any one observing us at this time it would have seemed that I was but a\nhanger-on, and a feeble imitator of Marshall. I took him to my tailor's,\nand he advised me on the cut of my coats; he showed me how to arrange my\nrooms, and I strove to copy his manner of speech and his general bearing;\nand yet I knew very well indeed that mine was a rarer and more original\nnature. I was willing to learn, that was all. There was much that Marshall\ncould teach me, and I used him without shame, without stint. I used him as\nI have used all those with whom I have been brought into close contact.\nSearch my memory as I will, I cannot recall a case of man or woman who ever\noccupied any considerable part of my thoughts and did not contribute\nlargely towards my moral or physical welfare. In other words, and in very\ncolloquial language, I never had useless friends hanging about me. From\nthis crude statement of a signal fact, the thoughtless reader will at once\njudge me rapacious, egotistical, false, fawning, mendacious. Well, I may be\nall this and more, but not because all who have known me have rendered me\neminent services. I can say that no one ever formed relationships in life\nwith less design than myself. Never have I given a thought to the advantage\nthat might accrue from being on terms of friendship with this man and\navoiding that one. \"Then how do you explain,\" cries the angry reader, \"that\nyou have never had a friend whom you did not make a profit out of? You must\nhave had very few friends.\" On the contrary, I have had many friends, and\nof all sorts and kinds--men and women: and, I repeat, none took part in my\nlife who did not contribute something towards my well-being. It must, of\ncourse, be understood that I make no distinction between mental and\nmaterial help; and in my case the one has ever been adjuvant to the other.\n\"Pooh, pooh!\" again exclaims the reader; \"I for one will not believe that\nchance has only sent across your way the people who were required to assist\nyou.\" Chance! dear reader, is there such a thing as chance? Do you believe\nin chance? Do you attach any precise meaning to the word? Do you employ it\nat haphazard, allowing it to mean what it may? Chance! What a field for\npsychical investigation is at once opened up; how we may tear to shreds our\npast lives in search of--what? Of the Chance that made us. I think, reader,\nI can throw some light on the general question, by replying to your taunt:\nChance, or the conditions of life under which we live, sent, of course,\nthousands of creatures across my way who were powerless to benefit me; but\nthen an instinct of which I knew nothing, of which I was not even\nconscious, withdrew me from them, and I was attracted to others. Have you\nnot seen a horse suddenly leave a corner of a field to seek pasturage\nfurther away?\n\nNever could I interest myself in a book if it were not the exact diet my\nmind required at the time, or in the very immediate future. The mind asked,\nreceived, and digested. So much was assimilated, so much expelled; then,\nafter a season, similar demands were made, the same processes were repeated\nout of sight, below consciousness, as is the case in a well-ordered\nstomach. Shelley, who fired my youth with passion, and purified and upbore\nit for so long, is now to me as nothing: not a dead or faded thing, but a\nthing out of which I personally have drawn all the sustenance I may draw\nfrom him; and, therefore, it (that part which I did not absorb) concerns me\nno more. And the same with Gautier. Mdlle. de Maupin, that godhead of\nflowing line, that desire not \"of the moth for the star,\" but for such\nperfection of hanging arm and leaned thigh as leaves passion breathless and\nfain of tears, is now, if I take up the book and read, weary and ragged as\na spider's web, that has hung the winter through in the dusty, forgotten\ncorner of a forgotten room. My old rapture and my youth's delight I can\nregain only when I think of that part of Gautier which is now incarnate in\nme.\n\nAs I picked up books, so I picked up my friends. I read friends and books\nwith the same passion, with the same avidity; and as I discarded my books\nwhen I had assimilated as much of them as my system required, so I\ndiscarded my friends when they ceased to be of use to me. I use the word\n\"use\" in its fullest, not in its limited and twenty-shilling sense. This\nreduction of the intellect to the blind unconsciousness of the lower organs\nwill strike some as a violation of man's best beliefs, and as saying very\nlittle for the particular intellect that can be so reduced. But I am not\nsure these people are right. I am inclined to think that as you ascend the\nscale of thought to the great minds, these unaccountable impulses,\nmysterious resolutions, sudden, but certain knowings, falling whence, or\nhow it is impossible to say, but falling somehow into the brain, instead of\ngrowing rarer, become more and more frequent; indeed, I think that if the\nreally great man were to confess to the working of his mind, we should see\nhim constantly besieged by inspirations ... inspirations! Ah! how human\nthought only turns in a circle, and how, when we think we are on the verge\nof a new thought, we slip into the enunciation of some time-worn truth. But\nI say again, let general principles be waived; it will suffice for the\ninterest of these pages if it be understood that brain instincts have\nalways been, and still are, the initial and the determining powers of my\nbeing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the studio, where I had been working for the last three or four months\nso diligently, became wearisome to me, and for two reasons. First, because\nit deprived me of many hours of Marshall's company. Secondly--and the\nsecond reason was the graver--because I was beginning to regard the\ndelineation of a nymph, or youth bathing, etc., as a very narrow channel to\ncarry off the strong, full tide of a man's thought. For now thoughts of\nlove and death, and the hopelessness of life, were in active fermentation\nwithin me and sought for utterance with a strange unintermittingness of\nappeal. I yearned merely to give direct expression to my pain. Life was\nthen in its springtide; every thought was new to me, and it would have\nseemed a pity to disguise even the simplest emotion in any garment when it\nwas so beautiful in its Eden-like nakedness. The creatures whom I met in\nthe ways and by ways of Parisian life, whose gestures and attitudes I\ndevoured with my eyes, and whose souls I hungered to know, awoke in me a\ntense irresponsible curiosity, but that was all,--I despised, I hated them,\nthought them contemptible, and to select them as subjects of artistic\ntreatment, could not then, might never, have occurred to me, had the\nsuggestion to do so not come direct to me from the outside.\n\nAt the time I am writing I lived in an old-fashioned hotel on the\nBoulevard, which an enterprising Belgian had lately bought and was\nendeavouring to modernise; an old-fashioned hotel, that still clung to its\nancient character in the presence of half a dozen old people, who, for\nantediluvian reasons, continue to dine on certain well-specified days at\nthe _table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te_. Fifteen years have passed away, and these old\npeople, no doubt, have joined their ancestors; but I can see them still\nsitting in that _salle \u00c3\u00a0 manger_; the _buffets en vieux ch\u00c3\u00aane_;\nthe opulent candelabra _en style d'empire_; the waiter lighting the\ngas in the pale Parisian evening. That white-haired man, that tall, thin,\nhatchet-faced American, has dined at this _table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te_ for the last\nthirty years--he is talkative, vain, foolish, and authoritative. The clean,\nneatly-dressed old gentleman who sits by him, looking so much like a French\ngentleman, has spent a great part of his life in Spain. With that piece of\nnews, and its subsequent developments, your acquaintance with him begins\nand ends; the eyes, the fan, the mantilla, how it began, how it was broken\noff, and how it began again. Opposite sits another French gentleman, with\nbeard and bristly hair. He spent twenty years of his life in India, and he\ntalks of his son who has been out there for the last ten, and who has just\nreturned home. There is the Italian comtesse of sixty summers, who dresses\nlike a girl of sixteen and smokes a cigar after dinner,--if there are not\ntoo many strangers in the room. She terms a stranger any one whom she has\nnot seen at least once before. The little fat, neckless man, with the great\nbald head, fringed below the ears with hair, is M. Duval. He is a dramatic\nauthor--the author of a hundred and sixty plays. He does not intrude\nhimself on your notice, but when you speak to him on literary matters he\nfixes a pair of tiny, sloe-like eyes on you, and talks affably of his\ncollaborateurs.\n\nI was soon deeply interested in M. Duval, and I invited him to come to the\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9_ after dinner. I paid for his coffee and liqueurs, I offered him\na choice cigar. He did not smoke; I did. It was, of course, inevitable that\nI should find out that he had not had a play produced for the last twenty\nyears, but then the aureole of the hundred and sixty was about his poor\nbald head. I thought of the chances of life, he alluded to the war; and so\nthis unpleasantness was passed over, and we entered on more genial subjects\nof conversation. He had written plays with everybody; his list of\ncollaborateurs was longer than any list of lady patronesses for an English\ncounty ball; there was no literary kitchen in which he had not helped to\ndish up. I was at once amazed and delighted. Had M. Duval written his\nhundred and sixty plays in the seclusion of his own rooms, I should have\nbeen less surprised; it was the mystery of the _s\u00c3\u00a9ances_ of\ncollaboration, the rendezvous, the discussion, the illustrious company,\nthat overwhelmed me in a rapture of wonder and respectful admiration. Then\ncame the anecdotes. They were of all sorts. Here are a few specimens: He,\nDuval, had written a one-act piece with Dumas _p\u00c3\u00a8re_; it had been\nrefused at the Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, and then it had been about, here, there, and\neverywhere; finally the _Vari\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9s_ had asked for some alterations, and\n_c'\u00c3\u00a9tait une affaire entendue_. \"I made the alterations one afternoon,\nand wrote to Dumas, and what do you think,--by return of post I had a\nletter from him saying he could not consent to the production of a one-act\npiece, signed by him, at the _Vari\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9s_, because his son was then\ngiving a five-act piece at the Gymnase.\" Then came a string of indecent\nwitticisms by Suzanne Lagier and Dejazet. They were as old as the world,\nbut they were new to me, and I was amused and astonished. These\n_bon-mots_ were followed by an account of how Gautier wrote his Sunday\nfeuilleton, and how he and Balzac had once nearly come to blows. They had\nagreed to collaborate. Balzac was to contribute the scenario, Gautier the\ndialogue. One morning Balzac came with the scenario of the first act. \"Here\nit is, Gautier! I suppose you can let me have it back finished by to-morrow\nafternoon?\" And the old gentleman would chirp along in this fashion till\nmidnight. I would then accompany him to his rooms in the Quartier\nMontmartre--rooms high up on the fifth floor--where, between two pictures,\nsupposed to be by Angelica Kaufmann, M. Duval had written unactable plays\nfor the last twenty years, and where he would continue to write unactable\nplays until God called him to a world, perhaps, of eternal cantatas, but\nwhere, by all accounts, _l'exposition de la pi\u00c3\u00a8ce selon la formule de M.\nScribe_ is still unknown.\n\nHow I used to enjoy these conversations! I remember how I used to stand on\nthe pavement after having bid the old gentleman good-night, regretting I\nhad not demanded some further explanation regarding _le mouvement\nRomantique_, or _la fa\u00c3\u00a7on de M. Scribe de m\u00c3\u00a9nager la situation_.\n\nWhy not write a comedy? So the thought came. I had never written anything\nsave a few ill-spelt letters; but no matter. To find a plot, that was the\nfirst thing to do. Take Marshall for hero and Alice for heroine, surround\nthem with the old gentlemen who dined at the _table d'h\u00c3\u00b4te_, flavour\nwith the Italian countess who smoked cigars when there were not too many\nstrangers present. After three weeks of industrious stirring, the\ningredients did begin to simmer into something resembling a plot. Put it\nupon paper. Ah! there was my difficulty. I remembered suddenly that I had\nread \"Cain,\" \"Manfred,\" \"The Cenci,\" as poems, without ever thinking of how\nthe dialogue looked upon paper; besides, they were in blank verse. I hadn't\na notion how prose dialogue would look upon paper. Shakespeare I had never\nopened; no instinctive want had urged me to read him. He had remained,\ntherefore, unread, unlooked at. Should I buy a copy? No; the name repelled\nme--as all popular names repelled me. In preference I went to the Gymnase,\nand listened attentively to a comedy by M. Dumas _fils_. But strain my\nimagination as I would, I could not see the spoken words in their written\nform. Oh, for a look at the prompter's copy, the corner of which I could\nsee when I leaned forward! At last I discovered in Galignani's library a\ncopy of Leigh Hunt's edition of the old dramatists, and after a month's\nstudy of Congreve Wycherley, Vanbrugh, and Farquhar, I completed a comedy\nin three acts, which I entitled \"Worldliness.\" It was, of course, very bad;\nbut, if my memory serves me well, I do not think it was nearly so bad as\nmight be imagined.\n\nNo sooner was the last scene written than I started at once for London,\nconfident I should find no difficulty in getting my play produced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nIs it necessary to say that I did not find a manager to produce my play? A\nprinter was more attainable, and the correction of proofs amused me for a\nwhile. I wrote another play; and when the hieing after theatrical managers\nbegan to lose its attractiveness my thoughts reverted to France, which\nalways haunted me; and which now possessed me as if with the sweet and\nmagnetic influence of home.\n\nHow important my absence from Paris seemed to me; and how Paris rushed into\nmy eyes!--Paris--public ball-rooms, _caf\u00c3\u00a9s_, the models in the studio\nand the young girls painting, and Marshall, Alice, and Julien.\nMarshall!--my thoughts pointed at him through the intervening streets and\nthe endless procession of people coming and going.\n\n\"M. Marshall, is he at home?\" \"M. Marshall left here some months ago.\" \"Do\nyou know his address?\" \"I'll ask my husband.\" \"Do you know M. Marshall's\naddress!\" \"Yes, he's gone to live in the Rue de Douai.\" \"What number?\" \"I\nthink it is fifty-four.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Coachman, wake up; drive me to the Rue\nde Douai.\"\n\nBut Marshall was not to be found at the Rue de Douai; and he had left no\naddress. There was nothing for it but to go to the studio; I should be able\nto obtain news of him there,--perhaps find him. But when I pulled aside the\ncurtain, the accustomed piece of slim nakedness did not greet my eyes; only\nthe blue apron of an old woman enveloped in a cloud of dust. \"The gentlemen\nare not here to-day, the studio is closed; I am sweeping up.\" \"Oh, and\nwhere is M. Julien?\" \"I cannot say, sir: perhaps at the _caf\u00c3\u00a9_, or\nperhaps he is gone to the country.\" This was not very encouraging, and now,\nmy enthusiasm thoroughly damped, I strolled along _le Passage_,\nlooking at the fans, the bangles and the litter of cheap trinkets that each\nwindow was filled with. On the left at the corner of the Boulevard was our\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9_. As I came forward the waiter moved one of the tin tables, and\nthen I saw the fat Proven\u00c3\u00a7al. But just as if he had seen me yesterday he\nsaid, \"_Tiens! c'est vous; une deme tasse? oui ... gar\u00c3\u00a7on, une deme\ntasse._\" Presently the conversation turned on Marshall; they had not\nseen much of him lately. \"_Il parait qu'il est plus amoureux que\njamais,_\" Julien replied sardonically.\n\nI found my friend in large furnished apartments on the ground floor in the\nRue Duphot. The walls were stretched with blue silk, there were large\nmirrors and great gilt cornices. Passing into the bedroom I found the young\ngod wallowing in the finest of fine linen--in a great Louis XV. bed, and\nthere were cupids above him. \"Holloa! what, you back again, Dayne? we\nthought we weren't going to see you again.\"\n\n\"It's nearly one o'clock: get up. What's the news?\"\n\n\"To-day is the opening of the exposition of the Impressionists. We'll have\na bit of breakfast round the corner, at Durant's, and we'll go on there. I\nhear that Bedlam is nothing to it; there is a canvas there twenty feet\nsquare and in three tints: pale yellow for the sunlight, brown for the\nshadows, and all the rest is sky-blue. There is, I am told, a lady walking\nin the foreground with a ring-tailed monkey, and the tail is said to be\nthree yards long.\"\n\nAnd so we went to jeer a group of enthusiasts that willingly forfeit all\ndelights of the world in the hope of realising a new aestheticism; we went\ninsolent with patent leather shoes and bright kid gloves and armed with all\nthe jargon of the school. \"_Cette jambe ne porte pas;_\" \"_la nature\nne se fait pas comme \u00c3\u00a7a;_\" \"_on dessine par les masses; combien de\nt\u00c3\u00aates?_\" \"_Sept et demi._\" \"_Si j'avais un morceau de craie je\nmettrais celle-l\u00c3\u00a0 dans un bocal, c'est un foetus,_\" etc.; in a word, all\nthat the journals of culture are pleased to term an artistic education. And\nthen the boisterous laughter, exaggerated in the hope of giving as much\npain as possible.\n\nThe history of Impressionist art is simple. In the beginning of this\ncentury the tradition of French art--the tradition of Boucher, Fragonard,\nand Watteau--had been completely lost; having produced genius, their art\ndied. Ingres is the sublime flower of the classic art which succeeded the\nart of the palace and the boudoir: further than Ingres it was impossible to\ngo, and his art died. Then the Turners and Constables came to France, and\nthey begot Troyon, and Troyon begot Millet, Courbet, Corot, and Rousseau,\nand these in turn begot Degas, Pissarro, Madame Morizot, and Guillaumin.\nDegas is a pupil of Ingres, but he applies the marvellous acuteness of\ndrawing he learned from his master to delineating the humblest aspects of\nmodern life. Degas draws not by the masses, but by the character;--his\nsubjects are shop-girls, ballet-girls, and washerwomen, but the qualities\nthat endow them with immortality are precisely those which eternalise the\nvirgins and saints of Leonardo da Vinci in the minds of men. You see the\nfat, vulgar woman in the long cloak trying on a hat in front of the\npier-glass. So marvellously well are the lines of her face observed and\nrendered that you can tell exactly what her position in life is; you know\nwhat the furniture of her rooms is like; you know what she would say to you\nif she were to speak. She is as typical of the nineteenth century as\nFragonard's ladies are of the Court of Louis XV. To the right you see a\npicture of two shop-girls with bonnets in their hands. So accurately are\nthe habitual movements of the heads and the hands observed that you at once\nrealise the years of bonnet-showing and servile words that these women have\nlived through. We have seen Degas do this before--it is a welcome\nrepetition of a familiar note, but it is not until we turn to the set of\nnude figures that we find the great artist revealing any new phase of his\ntalent. The first, in an attitude which suggests the kneeling Venus, washes\nher thighs in a tin bath. The second, a back view, full of the\nmalformations of forty years, of children, of hard work, stands gripping\nher flanks with both hands. The naked woman has become impossible in modern\nart; it required Degas' genius to infuse new life into the worn-out theme.\nCynicism was the great means of eloquence of the middle ages, and with\ncynicism Degas has rendered the nude again an artistic possibility. What\nMr. Horsley or the British matron would say it is difficult to guess.\nPerhaps the hideousness depicted by M. Degas would frighten them more than\nthe sensuality which they condemn in Sir Frederick Leighton. But, be this\nas it may, it is certain that the great, fat, short-legged creature, who in\nher humble and touching ugliness passes a chemise over her lumpy shoulders,\nis a triumph of art. Ugliness is trivial, the monstrous is terrible;\nVelasquez knew this when he painted his dwarfs.\n\nPissarro exhibited a group of girls gathering apples in a garden--sad greys\nand violets beautifully harmonised. The figures seem to move as in a dream:\nwe are on the thither side of life, in a world of quiet colour and happy\naspiration. Those apples will never fall from the branches, those baskets\nthat the stooping girls are filling will never be filled: that garden is\nthe garden of the peace that life has not for giving, but which the painter\nhas set in an eternal dream of violet and grey.\n\nMadame Morizot exhibited a series of delicate fancies. Here are two young\ngirls; the sweet atmosphere folds them as with a veil; they are all summer;\ntheir dreams are limitless, their days are fading, and their ideas follow\nthe flight of the white butterflies through the standard roses. Take note,\ntoo, of the stand of fans; what delicious fancies are there--willows,\nbalconies, gardens, and terraces.\n\nThen, contrasting with these distant tendernesses, there was the vigorous\npainting of Guillaumin. There life is rendered in violent and colourful\nbrutality. The ladies fishing in the park, with the violet of the skies and\nthe green of the trees descending upon them, is a _chef d'oeuvre_.\nNature seems to be closing about them like a tomb; and that\nhillside,--sunset flooding the skies with yellow and the earth with blue\nshadow,--is another piece of painting that will one day find a place in one\nof the public galleries; and the same can be said of the portrait of the\nwoman on a background of chintz flowers.\n\nWe could but utter coarse gibes and exclaim, \"What could have induced him\nto paint such things? surely he must have seen that it was absurd. I wonder\nif the Impressionists are in earnest or if it is only _une blague qu'on\nnous fait?_\" Then we stood and screamed at Monet, that most exquisite\npainter of blonde light. We stood before the \"Turkeys,\" and seriously we\nwondered if \"it was serious work,\"--that _chef d'oeuvre!_ the high\ngrass that the turkeys are gobbling is flooded with sunlight so swift and\nintense that for a moment the illusion is complete. \"Just look at the\nhouse! why, the turkeys couldn't walk in at the door. The perspective is\nall wrong.\" Then followed other remarks of an educational kind; and when we\ncame to those piercingly personal visions of railway stations by the same\npainter,--those rapid sensations of steel and vapour,--our laughter knew no\nbounds. \"I say, Marshall, just look at this wheel; he dipped his brush into\ncadmium yellow and whisked it round, that's all.\" Nor did we understand any\nmore Renoir's rich sensualities of tone; nor did the mastery with which he\nachieves an absence of shadow appeal to us. You see colour and light in his\npictures as you do in nature, and the child's criticism of a portrait--\"Why\nis one side of the face black?\" is answered. There was a half length nude\nfigure of a girl. How the round fresh breasts palpitate in the light! such\na glorious glow of whiteness was attained never before. But we saw nothing\nexcept that the eyes were out of drawing.\n\nFor art was not for us then as it is now,--a mere emotion, right or wrong\nonly in proportion to its intensity; we believed then in the grammar of\nart, perspective, anatomy, and _la jambe qui porte_; and we found all\nthis in Julien's studio.\n\nA year passed; a year of art and dissipation--one part art, two parts\ndissipation. We mounted and descended at pleasure the rounds of society's\nladder. One evening we would spend at Constant's, Rue de la Gaiet\u00c3\u00a9, in the\ncompany of thieves and housebreakers; on the following evening we were\ndining with a duchess or a princess in the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. And we prided\nourselves vastly on our versatility in using with equal facility the\nlanguage of the \"fence's\" parlour, and that of the literary salon; on being\nable to appear as much at home in one as in the other. Delighted at our\nprowess, we often whispered, \"The princess, I swear, would not believe her\neyes if she saw us now;\" and then in terrible slang we shouted a\nbenediction on some \"crib\" that was going to be broken into that evening.\nAnd we thought there was something very thrilling in leaving the Rue de la\nGaiet\u00c3\u00a9, returning home to dress, and presenting our spotless selves to the\n_\u00c3\u00a9lite_. And we succeeded very well, as indeed all young men do who\nwaltz perfectly and avoid making love to the wrong woman.\n\nBut the excitement of climbing up and down the social ladder did not stave\noff our craving for art; and there came about this time a very decisive\nevent in our lives. Marshall's last and really _grande passion_ had\ncome to a violent termination, and monetary difficulties forced him to turn\nhis thoughts to painting as a means of livelihood. This decided me. I asked\nhim to come and live with me, and to be as near our studio as possible, I\ntook an _appartement_ in the Passage des Panoramas. It was not\npleasant that your window should open, not to the sky, but to an unclean\nprospect of glass roofing; nor was it agreeable to get up at seven in the\nmorning; and ten hours of work daily are trying to the resolution even of\nthe best intentioned. But we had sworn to forego all pleasures for the sake\nof art--table d'h\u00c3\u00b4tes in the Rue Maubeuge, French and foreign duchesses in\nthe Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es, thieves in the Rue de la Gaiet\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nI was entering therefore on a duel with Marshall for supremacy in an art\nfor which, as has already been said, I possessed no qualifications. It will\nreadily be understood how a mind like mine, so keenly alive to all\nimpulses, and so unsupported by any moral convictions, would suffer in so\nkeen a contest waged under such unequal and cruel conditions. It was in\ntruth a year of great passion and great despair. Defeat is bitter when it\ncomes swiftly and conclusively, but when defeat falls by inches like the\nfatal pendulum in the pit, the agony is a little out of reach of words to\ndefine. It was even so. I remember the first day of my martyrdom. The\nclocks were striking eight; we chose our places, got into position. After\nthe first hour, I compared my drawing with Marshall's. He had, it is true,\ncaught the movement of the figure better than I, but the character and the\nquality of his work was miserable. That of mine was not. I have said I\npossessed no artistic facility, but I did not say faculty, my drawing was\nnever common; it was individual in feeling, it was refined. I possessed all\nthe rarer qualities, but not that primary power without which all is\nvalueless;--I mean the talent of the boy who can knock off a clever\ncaricature of his schoolmaster or make a _life-like_ sketch of his\nfavourite horse on the barn door with a piece of chalk.\n\nThe following week Marshall made a great deal of progress; I thought the\nmodel did not suit me, and hoped for better luck next time. That time never\ncame, and at the end of the first month I was left toiling hopelessly in\nthe distance. Marshall's mind, though shallow, was bright, and he\nunderstood with strange ease all that was told him, and was able to put\ninto immediate practice the methods of work inculcated by the professors.\nIn fact, he showed himself singularly capable of education; little could be\ndrawn out, but a great deal could be put in (using the word in its modern,\nnot in its original sense). He showed himself intensely anxious to learn\nand to accept all that was said: the ideas and feelings of others ran into\nhim like water into a bottle whose neck is suddenly stooped below the\nsurface of the stream. He was an ideal pupil. It was Marshall here, it was\nMarshall there, and soon the studio was little but an agitation in praise\nof him, and his work, and anxious speculation arose as to the medals he\nwould obtain. I continued the struggle for nine months. I was in the studio\nat eight in the morning; I measured my drawing; I plumbed it throughout; I\nsketched in, having regard to _la jambe qui porte_; I modelled _par\nles masses_. During breakfast I considered how I should work during the\nafternoon; at night I lay awake thinking of what I might do to attain a\nbetter result. But my efforts availed me nothing; it was like one who,\nfalling, stretches his arms for help and grasps the yielding air. How\nterrible are the languors and yearnings of impotence! how wearing! what an\naching void they leave in the heart! And all this I suffered until the\nburden of unachieved desire grew intolerable.\n\nI laid down my charcoal and said, \"I will never draw or paint again.\" That\nvow I have kept.\n\nSurrender brought relief, but my life seemed at an end. I looked upon a\nblank space of years desolate as a grey and sailless sea. \"What shall I\ndo?\" I asked myself, and my heart was weary and hopeless. Literature? my\nheart did not answer the question at once. I was too broken and overcome by\nthe shock of failure; failure precise and stern, admitting of no\nequivocation. I strove to read: but it was impossible to sit at home almost\nwithin earshot of the studio, and with all the memories of defeat still\nringing their knells in my heart. Marshall's success clamoured loudly from\nwithout; every day, almost every hour of the day, I heard of the medals\nwhich he would carry off; of what Lefevre thought of his drawing this week,\nof Boulanger's opinion of his talent. I do not wish to excuse my conduct,\nbut I cannot help saying that Marshall showed me neither consideration nor\npity; he did not even seem to understand that I was suffering, that my\nnerves had been terribly shaken, and he flaunted his superiority\nrelentlessly in my face--his good looks, his talents, his popularity. I did\nnot know then how little these studio successes really meant.\n\nVanity? no, it was not his vanity that maddened me; to me vanity is rarely\ndispleasing, sometimes it is singularly attractive; but by a certain\ninsistence and aggressiveness in the details of life he allowed me to feel\nthat I was only a means for the moment, a serviceable thing enough, but one\nthat would be very soon discarded and passed over. This was intolerable. I\nbroke up my establishment. By so doing I involved my friend in grave and\ncruel difficulties; by this action I imperilled his future prospects. It\nwas a dastardly action; but his presence had grown unbearable; yes,\nunbearable in the fullest acceptation of the word, and in ridding myself of\nhim I felt as if a world of misery were being lifted from me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nAfter three months spent in a sweet seaside resort, where unoccupied men\nand ladies whose husbands are abroad happily congregate, I returned to\nParis refreshed.\n\nMarshall and I were no longer on speaking terms, but I saw him daily, in a\nnew overcoat, of a cut admirably adapted to his figure, sweeping past the\nfans and the jet ornaments of the Passage des Panoramas. The coat\ninterested me, and I remembered that if I had not broken with him I should\nhave been able to ask him some essential questions concerning it. Of such\ntrifles as this the sincerest friendships are made; he was as necessary to\nme as I to him, and after some demur on his part a reconciliation was\neffected.\n\nThen I took an _appartement_ in one of the old houses in Rue de la\nTour des Dames, for the windows there overlooked a bit of tangled garden\nwith a few dilapidated statues. It was Marshall of course who undertook the\ntask of furnishing, and he lavished on the rooms the fancies of an\nimagination that suggested the collaboration of a courtesan of high degree\nand a fifth-rate artist. Nevertheless, our salon was a pretty\nresort--English cretonne of a very happy design--vine leaves, dark green\nand golden, broken up by many fluttering jays. The walls were stretched\nwith this colourful cloth, and the armchairs and the couches were to match.\nThe drawing-room was in cardinal red, hung from the middle of the ceiling\nand looped up to give the appearance of a tent; a faun, in terra cotta,\nlaughed in the red gloom, and there were Turkish couches and lamps. In\nanother room you faced an altar, a Buddhist temple, a statue of the Apollo,\nand a bust of Shelley. The bedrooms were made unconventual with cushioned\nseats and rich canopies; and in picturesque corners there were censers,\ngreat church candlesticks, and palms; then think of the smell of burning\nincense and wax and you will have imagined the sentiment of our apartment\nin Rue de la Tour des Dames. I bought a Persian cat, and a python that made\na monthly meal off guinea pigs; Marshall, who did not care for pets, filled\nhis rooms with flowers--he used to sleep beneath a tree of gardenias in\nfull bloom. We were so, Henry Marshall and Edwin Dayne, when we went to\nlive in 76, Rue de la Tour des Dames, we hoped for the rest of our lives.\nHe was to paint, I was to write.\n\nBefore leaving for the seaside I had bought some volumes of Hugo and De\nMusset; but in pleasant, sunny Boulogne poetry went flat, and it was not\nuntil I got into my new rooms that I began to read seriously. Books are\nlike individuals; you know at once if they are going to create a sense\nwithin the sense, to fever, to madden you in blood and brain, or if they\nwill merely leave you indifferent, or irritable, having unpleasantly\ndisturbed sweet intimate musings as might a draught from an open window.\nMany are the reasons for love, but I confess I only love woman or book,\nwhen it is as a voice of conscience, never heard before, heard suddenly, a\nvoice I am at once endearingly intimate with. This announces feminine\ndepravities in my affections. I am feminine, morbid, perverse. But above\nall perverse, almost everything perverse interests, fascinates me.\nWordsworth is the only simple-minded man I ever loved, if that great\naustere mind, chill even as the Cumberland year, can be called simple. But\nHugo is not perverse, nor even personal. Reading him was like being in\nchurch with a strident-voiced preacher shouting from out of a terribly\nsonorous pulpit. \"Les Orientales.\" An East of painted card-board, tin\ndaggers, and a military band playing the Turkish patrol in the Palais Royal\n... The verse is grand, noble, tremendous; I liked it, I admired it, but it\ndid not--I repeat the phrase--awake a voice of conscience within me; and\neven the structure of the verse was too much in the style of public\nbuildings to please me. Of \"Les Feuilles d'Automne\" and \"Les Chants du\nCr\u00c3\u00a9puscule\" I remember nothing. Ten lines, fifty lines of \"La L\u00c3\u00a9gende des\nSi\u00c3\u00a8cles,\" and I always think that it is the greatest poetry I have ever\nread, but after a few pages I invariably put the book down and forget it.\nHaving composed more verses than any man that ever lived, Hugo can only be\ntaken in the smallest doses; if you repeat any passage to a friend across a\ncaf\u00c3\u00a9 table, you are both appalled by the splendour of the imagery, by the\nthunder of the syllables.\n\n    \"Quel dieu, quel moissonneur dans l'\u00c3\u00a9ternel \u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9\n    Avait s'en allant n\u00c3\u00a9gligemment jet\u00c3\u00a9\n    Cette faucille d'or dans les champs des \u00c3\u00a9toiles.\"\n\nBut if I read an entire poem I never escape that sensation of the ennui\nwhich is inherent in the gaud and the glitter of the Italian or Spanish\nimprovisatore. There never was anything French about Hugo's genius. Hugo\nwas a cross between an Italian improvisatore and a metaphysical German\nstudent. Take another verse--\n\n    \"Le clair de lune bleu qui baigne l'horizon.\"\n\nWithout a \"like\" or an \"as,\" by a mere statement of fact, the picture, nay\nmore, the impression, is produced. I confess I have a weakness for the poem\nwhich this line concludes--\"La f\u00c3\u00aate chez Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se;\" but admirable as it is\nwith its picture of mediaeval life, there is in it, like in all Hugo's\nwork, a sense of fabrication that dries up emotion in my heart. He shouts\nand raves over poor humanity, while he is gathering coppers for himself; he\ngoes in for an all-round patronage of the Almighty in a last stanza; but of\nthe two immortalities he evidently considers his own the most durable; he\ndoes not, however, become really intolerable until he gets on the subject\nof little children; he sings their innocence in great bombast, but he is\nwatching them; the poetry over, the crowd dispersed, he will appear a\nveritable Mr. Hyde.\n\nThe first time I read of _une bouche d'ombre_ I was astonished, nor\nthe second nor third repetition produced a change in my mood of mind; but\nsooner or later it was impossible to avoid conviction, that of the two \"the\nrosy fingers of the dawn,\" although some three thousand years older was\nyounger, truer, and more beautiful. Homer's similes can never grow old;\n_une bouche d'ombre_ was old the first time it was said. It is the\nbirthplace and the grave of Hugo's genius.\n\nOf Alfred de Musset I had heard a great deal. Marshall and the Marquise\nwere in the habit of reading him in moments of relaxation, they had marked\ntheir favourite passages, so he came to me highly recommended.\nNevertheless, I made but little progress in his poetry. His modernisms were\nout of tune with the present strain of my aspirations, and I did not find\nthe unexpected word and the eccentricities of expression which were, and\nare still, so dear to me. I am not a purist; an error of diction is very\npardonable if it does not err on the side of the commonplace; the\ncommonplace, the natural, is constitutionally abhorrent to me; and I have\nnever been able to read with any very thorough sense of pleasure even the\nopening lines of \"Rolla,\" that splendid lyrical outburst. What I remember\nof it now are those two odious _chevilles--marchait et respirait_, and\n_Astart\u00c3\u00a9 fille de l'onde am\u00c3\u00a8re_; nor does the fact that _am\u00c3\u00a8re_\nrhymes with _m\u00c3\u00a8re_ condone the offence, although it proves that even\nMusset felt that perhaps the richness of the rhyme might render tolerable\nthe intolerable. And it is to my credit that the Spanish love songs moved\nme not at all; and it was not until I read that magnificently grotesque\npoem \"La Ballade \u00c3\u00a0 la Lune,\" that I could be induced to bend the knee and\nacknowledge Musset a poet.\n\nI still read and spoke of Shelley with a rapture of joy,--he was still my\nsoul. But this craft, fashioned of mother o' pearl, with starlight at the\nhelm and moonbeams for sails, suddenly ran on a reef and went down, not out\nof sight, but out of the agitation of actual life. The reef was Gautier; I\nread \"Mdlle. de Maupin.\" The reaction was as violent as it was sudden. I\nwas weary of spiritual passion, and this great exaltation of the body above\nthe soul at once conquered and led me captive; this plain scorn of a world\nas exemplified in lacerated saints and a crucified Redeemer opened up to me\nillimitable prospects of fresh beliefs, and therefore new joys in things\nand new revolts against all that had come to form part and parcel of the\ncommonalty of mankind. Till now I had not even remotely suspected that a\ndeification of flesh and fleshly desire was possible, Shelley's teaching\nhad been, while accepting the body, to dream of the soul as a star, and so\npreserve our ideal; but now suddenly I saw, with delightful clearness and\nwith intoxicating conviction, that by looking without shame and accepting\nwith love the flesh, I might raise it to as high a place and within as\ndivine a light as even the soul had been set in. The ages were as an\naureole, and I stood as if enchanted before the noble nakedness of the\nelder gods: not the infamous nudity that sex has preserved in this modern\nworld, but the clean pagan nude,--a love of life and beauty, the broad fair\nbreast of a boy, the long flanks, the head thrown back; the bold fearless\ngaze of Venus is lovelier than the lowered glance of the Virgin, and I\ncried with my master that the blood that flowed upon Mount Calvary \"_ne\nm'a jamais baign\u00c3\u00a9 dans ses flots._\"\n\nI will not turn to the book to find the exact words of this sublime\nvindication, for ten years I have not read the Word that has become so\ninexpressibly a part of me; and shall I not refrain as Mdlle. de Maupin\nrefrained, knowing well that the face of love may not be twice seen? Great\nwas my conversion. None more than I had cherished mystery and dream: my\nlife until now had been but a mist which revealed as each cloud wreathed\nand went out, the red of some strange flower or some tall peak, blue and\nsnowy and fairylike in lonely moonlight; and now so great was my conversion\nthat the more brutal the outrage offered to my ancient ideal, the rarer and\nkeener was my delight. I read almost without fear: \"My dreams were of naked\nyouths riding white horses through mountain passes, there were no clouds in\nmy dreams, or if there were any, they were clouds that had been cut out as\nif in cardboard with a pair of scissors.\"\n\nI had shaken off all belief in Christianity early in life, and had suffered\nmuch. Shelley had replaced faith by reason, but I still suffered: but here\nwas a new creed which proclaimed the divinity of the body, and for a long\ntime the reconstruction of all my theories of life on a purely pagan basis\noccupied my whole attention. The exquisite outlines of the marvellous\ncastle, the romantic woods, the horses moving, the lovers leaning to each\nother's faces enchanted me; and then the indescribably beautiful\ndescription of the performance of _As you like it_, and the supreme\nrelief and perfect assuagement it brings to Rodolph, who then sees Mdlle.\nde Maupin for the first time in woman's attire. If she were dangerously\nbeautiful as a man, that beauty is forgotten in the rapture and praise of\nher unmatchable woman's loveliness.\n\nBut if Mdlle. de Maupin was the highest peak, it was not the entire\nmountain. The range was long, and each summit offered to the eye a new and\ndelightful prospect. There were the numerous tales,--tales as perfect as\nthe world has ever seen; \"La Morte Amoureuse,\" \"Jettatura,\" \"Une Nuit de\nCl\u00c3\u00a9op\u00c3\u00a2tre,\" etc., and then the very diamonds of the crown, \"Les Emaux et\nCam\u00c3\u00a9es,\" \"La Symphonie en Blanc Majeure,\" in which the adjective\n_blanc_ and _blanche_ is repeated with miraculous felicity in\neach stanza. And then Contralto,--\n\n    \"Mais seulement il se transpose\n      Et passant de la forme au son,\n    Trouvant dans la m\u00c3\u00a9tamorphose\n      La jeune fille et le gar\u00c3\u00a7on.\"\n\n_Transpose_,--a word never before used except in musical application,\nand now for the first time applied to material form, and with a\nbeauty-giving touch that Phidias might be proud of. I know not how I quote;\nsuch is my best memory of the stanza, and here, that is more important than\nthe stanza itself. And that other stanza, \"The Ch\u00c3\u00a2telaine and the Page;\"\nand that other, \"The Doves;\" and that other, \"Romeo and Juliet,\" and the\nexquisite cadence of the line ending \"_balcon_.\" Novelists have often\nshown how a love passion brings misery, despair, death, and ruin upon a\nlife, but I know of no story of the good or evil influence awakened by the\nchance reading of a book, the chain of consequences so far-reaching, so\nintensely dramatic. Never shall I open these books again, but were I to\nlive for a thousand years, their power in my soul would remain unshaken. I\nam what they made me. Belief in humanity, pity for the poor, hatred of\ninjustice, all that Shelley gave may never have been very deep or earnest;\nbut I did love, I did believe. Gautier destroyed these illusions. He taught\nme that our boasted progress is but a pitfall into which the race is\nfalling, and I learned that the correction of form is the highest ideal,\nand I accepted the plain, simple conscience of the pagan world as the\nperfect solution of the problem that had vexed me so long; I cried, \"ave\"\nto it all: lust, cruelty, slavery, and I would have held down my thumbs in\nthe Colosseum that a hundred gladiators might die and wash me free of my\nChristian soul with their blood.\n\nThe study of Baudelaire aggravated the course of the disease. No longer is\nit the grand barbaric face of Gautier; now it is the clean shaven face of\nthe mock priest, the slow, cold eyes and the sharp, cunning sneer of the\ncynical libertine who will be tempted that he may better know the\nworthlessness of temptation. \"Les Fleurs du Mal!\" beautiful flowers,\nbeautiful in sublime decay. What great record is yours, and were Hell a\nreality how many souls would we find wreathed with your poisonous blossoms.\nThe village maiden goes to her Faust; the children of the nineteenth\ncentury go to you, O Baudelaire, and having tasted of your deadly delight\nall hope of repentance is vain. Flowers, beautiful in your sublime decay, I\npress you to my lips; these northern solitudes, far from the rank Parisian\ngarden where I gathered you, are full of you, even as the sea-shell of the\nsea, and the sun that sets on this wild moorland evokes the magical verse:--\n\n\n    \"Un soir fait de rose et de bleu mystique\n    Nous \u00c3\u00a9changerons un \u00c3\u00a9clair unique\n    Comme un long sanglot tout charg\u00c3\u00a9 d'adieux.\"\n\nFor months I fed on the mad and morbid literature that the enthusiasm of\n1830 called into existence. The gloomy and sterile little pictures of\n\"Gaspard de la Nuit,\" or the elaborate criminality, \"Les Contes Immoraux,\"\nlaboriously invented lifeless things with creaky joints, pitiful lay\nfigures that fall to dust as soon as the book is closed, and in the dust\nonly the figures of the terrible ferryman and the unfortunate Dora remain.\n\"Madame Potiphar\" cost me forty francs, and I never read more than a few\npages.\n\nLike a pike after minnows, I pursued the works of Les Jeune France along\nthe quays and through every _passage_ in Paris. The money spent was\nconsiderable, the waste of time enormous. One man's solitary work (he died\nvery young, but he is known to have excelled all in length of his hair and\nthe redness of his waistcoats) resisted my efforts to capture it. At last I\ncaught sight of the precious volume in a shop on the Quai Voltaire.\nTrembling I asked the price. The man looked at me earnestly and answered,\n\"A hundred and fifty francs.\" No doubt it was a great deal of money, but I\npaid it and rushed home to read. Many that had gone before had proved\ndisappointing, and I was obliged to admit had contributed little towards my\nintellectual advancement; but this--this that I had heard about so\nlong--not a queer phrase, not an outrage of any sort of kind, not even a\nnew blasphemy, nothing, that is to say, nothing but a hundred and fifty\nfrancs. Having thus rudely, and very pikelike, knocked my nose against the\nbottom--this book was, most assuredly, the bottom of the literature of\n1830--I came up to the surface and began to look around my contemporaries\nfor something to read.\n\nI have remarked before on the instinctiveness of my likes and dislikes, on\nmy susceptibility to the sound of and even to the appearance of a name upon\npaper. I was repelled by Leconte de Lisle from the first, and it was only\nby a very deliberate outrage to my feelings that I bought and read \"Les\nPo\u00c3\u00a8mes Antiques,\" and \"Les Po\u00c3\u00a8mes Barbares;\" I was deceived in nothing, all\nI had anticipated I found--long, desolate boredom. Leconte de Lisle\nproduces on me the effect of a walk through the new Law Courts, with a\nsteady but not violent draught sweeping from end to end. Oh, the vile old\nprofessor of rhetoric! and when I saw him the last time I was in Paris, his\nhead--a declaration of righteousness, a cross between a Caesar by Gerome,\nand an archbishop of a provincial town, set all my natural antipathy\ninstantly on edge. Hugo is often pompous, shallow, empty, unreal, but he is\nat least an artist, and when he thinks of the artist and forgets the\nprophet, as in \"Les Chansons des Rues et des Bois,\" his juggling with the\nverse is magnificent, superb.\n\n    \"Comme un geai sur l'arbre\n      Le roi se tient fier;\n    Son coeur est de marbre,\n      Son ventre est de chair.\n\n    \"On a pour sa nuque\n      Et son front vermeil\n    Fait une perruque\n      Avec le soleil.\n\n    \"Il r\u00c3\u00a8gne, il v\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a8te\n      Effroyable z\u00c3\u00a9ro;\n    Sur lui se projette\n      L'ombre du bourreau.\n\n    \"Son tr\u00c3\u00b4ne est une tombe,\n      Et sur le pav\u00c3\u00a9\n    Quelque chose en tombe\n      Qu'on n'a point lav\u00c3\u00a9.\"\n\nBut how to get the first line of the last stanza into five syllables I\ncannot think. If ever I meet with the volume again I will look it out and\nsee how that _rude dompteur de syllables_ managed it. But stay, _son\ntr\u00c3\u00b4ne est la tombe_; that makes the verse, and the generalisation would\nbe in the \"line\" of Hugo. Hugo--how impossible it is to speak of French\nliterature without referring to him. Let these, however, be the concluding\nwords: he thought that by saying everything, and saying everything twenty\ntimes over, he would for ever render impossible the advent of another great\npoet. But a work of art is valuable, and pleasurable in proportion to its\nrarity; one beautiful book of verses is better than twenty books of\nbeautiful verses. This is an absolute and incontestable truth; a child can\nburlesque this truth--one verse is better than the whole poem: a word is\nbetter than the line; a letter is better than the word; but the truth is\nnot thereby affected. Hugo never had the good fortune to write a bad book,\nnor even a single bad line, so not having time to read all, the future will\nread none. What immortality would be gained by the destruction of one half\nof his magnificent works; what oblivion is secured by the publication of\nthese posthumous volumes.\n\nTo return to the Leconte de Lisle. See his \"Discours de R\u00c3\u00a9ception.\" Is it\npossible to imagine anything more absurdly arid? Rhetoric of this sort,\n\"_des vers d'or sur une \u00c3\u00a9cume d'airain_,\" and such sententious\nplatitudes (speaking of the realists), \"_Les \u00c3\u00a9pid\u00c3\u00a9mies de cette nature\npassent, et le g\u00c3\u00a9nie demeure._\"\n\nTh\u00c3\u00a9odore de Banville. At first I thought him cold, tinged with the\nrhetorical ice of the Leconte de Lisle. He had no new creed to proclaim nor\nold creed to denounce, the inherent miseries of human life did not seem to\ntouch him, and of the languors and ardours of animal or spiritual passion\nthere are none. What is there? a pure, clear song, an instinctive,\nincurable and lark-like love of the song. The lily is white, and the rose\nis red, such knowledge of, such observation of nature is enough for the\npoet, and he sings and he trills, there is silver magic in every note, and\nthe song as it ascends rings, and all the air quivers with the everwidening\ncircle of the echoes, sighing and dying out of the ear until the last\nfaintness is reached, and the glad rhymes clash and dash forth again on\ntheir a\u00c3\u00abrial way. Banville is not the poet, he is the bard. The great\nquestions that agitate the mind of man have not troubled him, life, death,\nand love he only perceives as stalks whereon he may weave his glittering\nweb of living words. Whatever his moods may be, he is lyrical. His wit\nflies out on clear-cut, swallow-like wings as when he said, in speaking of\nPaul Alexis' book \"Le Besoin d'aimer,\" \"_Vous avez trouvez un titre assez\nlaid pour faire reculer les divines \u00c3\u00a9toiles._\" I know not what\ninstrument to compare with his verse. I suppose I should say a flute; but\nit seems to me more like a marvellously toned piano. His hands pass over\nthe keys, and he produces Chopin-like music.\n\nIt is now well known that French verse is not seventy years old. If it was\nHugo who invented French rhyme it was Banville who broke up the couplet.\nHugo had perhaps ventured to place the pause between the adjective and its\nnoun, but it was not until Banville wrote the line, \"_Elle filait\npensivement la blanche laine_\" that the caesura received its final\n_coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce_. This verse has been probably more imitated than any\nother verse in the French language. _Pensivement_ was replaced by some\nsimilar four-syllable adverb, _Elle tirait nonchalamment les bas de soie,\netc_. It was the beginning of the end.\n\nI read the French poets of the modern school--Copp\u00c3\u00a9e, Mend\u00c3\u00a8s, L\u00c3\u00a9on Diex,\nVerlaine, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Maria Heredia, Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9, Rechepin, Villiers de l'Isle Adam.\nCopp\u00c3\u00a9e, as may be imagined, I only was capable of appreciating in his first\nmanner, when he wrote those exquisite but purely artistic sonnets \"La\nTulipe\" and \"Le Lys.\" In the latter a room decorated with daggers, armour,\njewellery and china is beautifully described, and it is only in the last\nline that the lily which animates and gives life to the whole is\nintroduced. But the exquisite poetic perceptivity Copp\u00c3\u00a9e showed in his\nmodern poems, the certainty with which he raised the commonest subject,\ninvesting it with sufficient dignity for his purpose, escaped me wholly,\nand I could not but turn with horror from such poems as \"La Nourrice\" and\n\"Le Petit Epicier.\" How anyone could bring himself to acknowledge the\nvulgar details of our vulgar age I could not understand. The fiery glory of\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 Maria de Heredia, on the contrary, filled me with enthusiasm--ruins\nand sand, shadow and silhouette of palms and pillars, negroes, crimson,\nswords, silence, and arabesques. As great copper pans go the clangour of\nthe rhymes.\n\n    \"Entre le ciel qui br\u00c3\u00bble et la mer qui moutonne,\n    Au somnolent soleil d'un midi monotone,\n    Tu songes, O guerri\u00c3\u00a8re, aux vieux conquistadors;\n    Et dans l'\u00c3\u00a9nervement des nuits chaudes et calmes,\n    Ber\u00c3\u00a7ant ta gloire \u00c3\u00a9teinte, O cit\u00c3\u00a9, tu t'endors\n    Sous les palmiers, au long fr\u00c3\u00a9missement des palmes.\"\n\nCatulle Mend\u00c3\u00a8s, a perfect realisation of his name, of his pale hair, of his\nfragile face illuminated with the idealism of a depraved woman. He takes\nyou by the arm, by the hand, he leans towards you, his words are caresses,\nhis fervour is delightful, and listening to him is as sweet as drinking a\nfair perfumed white wine. All he says is false--the book he has just read,\nthe play he is writing, the woman who loves him,... he buys a packet of\nbonbons in the streets and eats them, and it is false. An exquisite artist;\nphysically and spiritually he is art; he is the muse herself, or rather, he\nis one of the minions of the muse. Passing from flower to flower he goes,\nhis whole nature pulsing with butterfly voluptuousness. He has written\npoems as good as Hugo, as good as Leconte de Lisle, as good as Banville, as\ngood as Baudelaire, as good as Gautier, as good as Copp\u00c3\u00a9e; he never wrote\nan ugly line in his life, but he never wrote a line that some one of his\nbrilliant contemporaries might not have written. He has produced good work\nof all kinds \"et voil\u00c3\u00a0 tout.\" Every generation, every country, has its\nCatulle Mend\u00c3\u00a8s. Robert Buchanan is ours, only in the adaptation Scotch\ngruel has been substituted for perfumed white wine. No more delightful\ntalker than Mend\u00c3\u00a8s, no more accomplished _litt\u00c3\u00a9rateur_, no more fluent\nand translucid critic. I remember the great moonlights of the _Place\nPigale_, when, on leaving the caf\u00c3\u00a9, he would take me by the arm, and\nexpound Hugo's or Zola's last book, thinking as he spoke of the Greek\nsophists. There were for contrast Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9's Tuesday evenings, a few\nfriends sitting round the hearth, the lamp on the table. I have met none\nwhose conversation was more fruitful, but with the exception of his early\nverses I cannot say I ever frankly enjoyed his poetry. When I knew him he\nhad published the celebrated \"L'Apr\u00c3\u00a8s Midi d'un Faun:\" the first poem\nwritten in accordance with the theory of symbolism. But when it was given\nto me (this marvellous brochure furnished with strange illustrations and\nwonderful tassels), I thought it absurdly obscure. Since then, however, it\nhas been rendered by force of contrast with the brain-curdling enigmas the\nauthor has since published a marvel of lucidity; and were I to read it now\nI should appreciate its many beauties. It bears the same relation to the\nauthor's later work as _Rienzi_ to _The Walkyrie_. But what is\nsymbolism? Vulgarly speaking, saying the opposite to what you mean. For\nexample, you want to say that music which is the new art, is replacing the\nold art, which is poetry. First symbol: a house in which there is a\nfuneral, the pall extends over the furniture. The house is poetry, poetry\nis dead. Second symbol: \"_notre vieux grimoire_,\" _grimoire_ is the\nparchment, parchment is used for writing, therefore, _grimoire_ is the\nsymbol for literature, \"_d'o\u00c3\u00b9 s'exaltent les milliers_,\" thousands of\nwhat? of letters of course. We have heard a great deal in England of\nBrowning obscurity. The \"Red Cotton Nightcap Country\" is child's play\ncompared to a sonnet by a determined symbolist such as Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9, or better\nstill his disciple Ghil who has added to the difficulties of symbolism\nthose of poetic instrumentation. For according to M. Ghil and his organ\n_Les Ecrits pour l'Art_, it would appear that the syllables of the\nFrench language evoke in us the sensations of different colours;\nconsequently the timbre of the different instruments. The vowel _u_\ncorresponds to the colour yellow, and therefore to the sound of flutes.\n\nArthur Rimbaud was, it is true, first in the field with these pleasant and\ngenial theories; but M. Ghil informs us that Rimbaud was mistaken in many\nthings, particularly in coupling the sound of the vowel _u_ with the\ncolour green instead of with the colour yellow. M. Ghil has corrected this\nvery stupid blunder and many others; and his instrumentation in his last\nvolume, \"Le Geste Ing\u00c3\u00a9nu,\" may be considered as complete and definitive.\nThe work is dedicated to Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9, \"P\u00c3\u00a8re et seigneur des ors, des\npierreries, et des poissons,\" and other works are to follow:--the six tomes\nof \"L\u00c3\u00a9gendes de R\u00c3\u00aaves et de Sangs,\" the innumerable tomes of \"La Glose,\"\nand the single tome of \"La Loi.\"\n\nAnd that man Gustave Kahn, who takes the French language as a violin, and\nlets the bow of his emotion run at wild will upon it producing strange\nacute strains, unpremeditated harmonies comparable to nothing that I know\nof but some Hungarian rhapsody; verses of seventeen syllables interwoven\nwith verses of eight, and even nine, masculine rhymes, seeking strange\nunion with feminine rhymes in the middle of the line--a music sweet,\nsubtil, and epicene; the half-note, the inflexion, but not the full\ntone--as \"_se fondre, o souvenir, des lys \u00c3\u00a2cres d\u00c3\u00a9lices._\"\n\n    Se penchant vers les dahlias,\n    Des paons cabrient d\u00c3\u00a8s rosace lunaire\n    L'assoupissement des branches v\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a8re\n    Son pale visage aux mourants dahlias.\n\n    Elle \u00c3\u00a9coute au loin les br\u00c3\u00a8ves musiques\n    Nuit claire aux ramures d'accords,\n    Et la lassitude a berc\u00c3\u00a9 son corps\n    Au rhythme odorant des pures musiques.\n\n    Les paons out dress\u00c3\u00a9 la rampe occell\u00c3\u00a9e\n    Pour la descente de ses yeux vers le tapis\n      De choses et de sens\n    Qui va vers l'horizon, parure vemicul\u00c3\u00a9e\n      De son corps alangui\n      En \u00c3\u00a2me se tapit\n    Le flou d\u00c3\u00a9sir molli de r\u00c3\u00a9cits et d'encens.\n\nI laughed at these verbal eccentricities, but they were not without their\neffect, and that effect was a demoralising one; for in me they aggravated\nthe fever of the unknown, and whetted my appetite for the strange, abnormal\nand unhealthy in art. Hence all pallidities of thought and desire were\neagerly welcomed, and Verlaine became my poet. Never shall I forget the\nfirst enchantment of \"Les F\u00c3\u00aates Galantes.\" Here all is twilight.\n\nThe royal magnificences of the sunset have passed, the solemn beatitude of\nthe night is at hand but not yet here; the ways are veiled with shadow, and\nlit with dresses, white, that the hour has touched with blue, yellow,\ngreen, mauve, and undecided purple; the voices? strange contraltos; the\nforms? not those of men or women, but mystic, hybrid creatures, with hands\nnervous and pale, and eyes charged with eager and fitful light ... \"_un\nsoir \u00c3\u00a9quivoque d'automne_,\" ... \"_les belles pendent r\u00c3\u00aaveuses \u00c3\u00a0 nos bras_\"\n... and they whisper \"_les mots sp\u00c3\u00a9ciaux et tout bas_.\"\n\nGautier sang to his antique lyre praise of the flesh and contempt of the\nsoul; Baudelaire on a mediaeval organ chaunted his unbelief in goodness and\ntruth and his hatred of life. But Verlaine advances one step further: hate\nis to him as commonplace as love, unfaith as vulgar as faith. The world is\nmerely a doll to be attired to-day in a modern ball dress, to-morrow in\naureoles and stars. The Virgin is a pretty thing, worth a poem, but it\nwould be quite too silly to talk about belief or unbelief; Christ in wood\nor plaster we have heard too much of, but Christ in painted glass amid\ncrosiers and Latin terminations, is an amusing subject for poetry. And\nstrangely enough, a withdrawing from all commerce with virtue and vice is,\nit would seem, a licentiousness more curiously subtle and penetrating than\nany other; and the licentiousness of the verse is equal to that of the\nemotion; every natural instinct of the language is violated, and the simple\nmusic native in French metre is replaced by falsetto notes sharp and\nintense. The charm is that of an odour of iris exhaled by some ideal\ntissues, or of a missal in a gold case, a precious relic of the pomp and\nritual of an archbishop of Persepolis.\n\n    Parsifal a vaincu les filles, leur gentil\n    Babil et la luxure amusante et sa pente\n    Vers la chair de ce gar\u00c3\u00a7on vierge que cela tente\n    D'aimer des seins l\u00c3\u00a9gers et ce gentil babil.\n\n    Il a vaincu la femme belle au coeur subtil\n    Etalant ces bras frais et sa gorge excitante;\n    Il a vaincu l'enfer, il rentre dans sa tente\n    Avec un lourd troph\u00c3\u00a9e \u00c3\u00a0 son bras pueril.\n\n    Avec la lance qui per\u00c3\u00a7a le flanc supr\u00c3\u00aame\n    Il a gu\u00c3\u00a9ri le roi, le voici roi lui-m\u00c3\u00aame,\n    Et pr\u00c3\u00aatre du tr\u00c3\u00a8s-saint tr\u00c3\u00a9sor essentiel;\n\n    En robe d'or il adore, gloire et symbole,\n    Le vase pur o\u00c3\u00b9 resplendit le sang r\u00c3\u00a9el,\n    Et, o ces voix d'enfants chantent dans la coupole.\n\nI know of no more perfect thing than this sonnet. The hiatus in the last\nline was at first a little trying, but I have learned to love it; not in\nBaudelaire nor even in Poe is there more beautiful poetry to be found. Poe,\nunread and ill-understood in America and England, here, thou art an\nintegral part of our artistic life.\n\nThe Island o' Fay, Silence, Elionore, were the familiar spirits of an\napartment beautiful with tapestry and palms; Swinburne and Rossetti were\nthe English poets I read there; and in a golden bondage, I, a unit in the\ngeneration they have enslaved, clanked my fetters and trailed my golden\nchain. I had begun a set of stories in many various metres, to be called\n\"Roses of Midnight.\" One of the characteristics of the volume was that\ndaylight was banished from its pages. In the sensual lamplight of yellow\nboudoirs, or the wild moonlight of centenarian forests, my fantastic loves\nlived out their lives, died with the dawn which was supposed to be an\nawakening to consciousness of reality.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nA last hour of vivid blue and gold glare; but now the twilight sheds softly\nupon the darting jays, and only the little oval frames catch the fleeting\nbeams. I go to the miniatures. Amid the parliamentary faces, all strictly\ngarrotted with many-folded handkerchiefs, there is a metal frame enchased\nwith rubies and a few emeralds. And this _chef d'oeuvre_ of antique\nworkmanship surrounds a sharp, shrewdish, modern face, withal pretty. Fair\nshe is and thin.\n\nShe is a woman of thirty,--no,--she is the woman of thirty. Balzac has\nwritten some admirable pages on this subject; my memory of them is vague\nand uncertain, although durable, as all memories of him must be. But that\nmarvellous story, or rather study, has been blunted in my knowledge of this\ntiny face with the fine masses of hair drawn up from the neck and arranged\nelaborately on the crown. There is no fear of plagiary; he cannot have said\nall; he cannot have said what I want to say.\n\nLooking at this face so mundane, so intellectually mundane, I see why a\nyoung man of refined mind--a bachelor who spends at least a pound a day on\nhis pleasures, and in whose library are found some few volumes of modern\npoetry--seeks his ideal in a woman of thirty.\n\nIt is clear that, by the very essence of her being, the young girl may\nevoke no ideal but that of home; and home is in his eyes the antithesis of\nfreedom, desire, aspiration. He longs for mystery, deep and endless, and he\nis tempted with a foolish little illusion--white dresses, water colour\ndrawings, and popular music. He dreams of Pleasure, and he is offered Duty;\nfor do not think that that sylph-like waist does not suggest to him a yard\nof apron string, cries of children, and that most odious word, \"Papa.\" A\nyoung man of refined mind can look through the glass of the years.\n\nHe has sat in the stalls, opera-glass in hand; he has met women of thirty\nat balls, and has sat with them beneath shadowy curtains; he knows that the\nworld is full of beautiful women, all waiting to be loved and amused, the\ncircles of his immediate years are filled with feminine faces, they cluster\nlike flowers on this side and that, and they fade into garden-like spaces\nof colour. How many may love him? The loveliest may one day smile upon his\nknee! and shall he renounce all for that little creature who has just\nfinished singing, and is handing round cups of tea? Every bachelor\ncontemplating marriage says, \"I shall have to give up all for one, one.\"\n\nThe young girl is often pretty but her prettiness is vague and uncertain,\nit inspires a sort of pitying admiration, but it suggests nothing; the very\nessence of the young girl's being is that she should have nothing to\nsuggest, therefore the beauty of the young face fails to touch the\nimagination. No past lies hidden in those translucent eyes, no story of\nhate, disappointment, or sin. Nor is there in nine hundred and ninety-nine\ncases in a thousand any doubt that the hand, that spends at least a pound a\nday in restaurants and cabs, will succeed in gathering the muslin flower if\nhe so wills it, and by doing so he will delight every one. Where, then, is\nthe struggle? where, then, is the triumph? Therefore, I say that if a young\nman's heart is not set on children, and tiresome dinner parties, the young\ngirl presents to him no possible ideal. But the woman of thirty presents\nfrom the outset all that is necessary to ensnare the heart of a young man.\nI see her sitting in her beautiful drawing-room, all composed by, and all\nbelonging to her. Her chair is placed beneath an evergreen plant, and the\nlong leaves lean out as if to touch her neck. The great white and red roses\nof the _d'aubusson_ carpet are spread enigmatically about her feline\nfeet; a grand piano leans its melodious mouth to her; and there she sits\nwhen her visitors have left her, playing Beethoven's sonatas in the dreamy\nfirelight. The spring-tide shows but a bloom of unvarying freshness; August\nhas languished and loved in the strength of the sun. She is stately, she is\ntall. What sins, what disappointments, what aspirations lie in those grey\neyes, mysteriously still, and mysteriously revealed. These a young man\nlongs to know of, they are his life. He imagines himself sitting by her,\nwhen the others have gone, holding her hand, calling on her name; sometimes\nshe moves away and plays the moonlight sonata. Letting her hands droop upon\nthe keys she talks sadly, maybe affectionately; she speaks of the tedium of\nlife, of its disenchantments. He knows well what she means, he has suffered\nas she has; but could he tell her, could she understand, that in his love\nreality would dissolve into a dream, all limitations would open into\nboundless infinity.\n\nThe husband he rarely sees. Sometimes a latchkey is heard about half-past\nsix. The man is thick, strong, common; his jaws are heavy; his eyes are\nexpressionless; there is about him the loud swagger of the _caserne_;\nand he suggests the inevitable question, Why did she marry him?--a question\nthat every young man of refined mind asks a thousand times by day and ten\nthousand times by night, asks till he is five-and-thirty, and sees that his\ngeneration has passed into middle age.\n\nWhy did she marry him? Not the sea, nor the sky, nor the great mysterious\nmidnight, when he opens his casement and gazes into starry space will give\nhim answer; riddle that no Oedipus will ever come to unravel; this sphinx\nwill never throw herself from the rock into the clangour of the seagulls\nand waves; she will never divulge her secret; and if she is the woman and\nnot a woman of thirty, she has forgotten.\n\nThe young man shakes hands with the husband; he strives not to look\nembarrassed, and he talks of indifferent things--of how well he (the\nhusband) is looking, of his amusements, his projects; and then he (the\nyoung man of refined mind) tastes of that keen and highly-seasoned\ndelight--happiness in crime. He knows not the details of her home life, the\nhusband is merely a dark cloud that fills one side of the picture,\nsometimes obliterating the sunlight; a shadowy shape that in certain\nmoments solidifies and assumes the likeness of a rock-sculptured, imminent\nmonster; but the shadow and the shape and the threat are magnetic, and in a\nsense of danger the fascination is sealed....\n\nSee the young man of refined mind in a ball room! He is leaning against the\nwoodwork in a distant doorway, he scarcely knows what to do with himself;\nand he is now striving to interest himself in the conversation of a group\nof men twice his age. I will not say he is shunned; but neither the matrons\nnor the young girls make any advances towards him. The young girls looking\nso sweet--in the oneness of their fresh hair, flowers, dresses, and\nglances--are being introduced, are getting up to dance, and the hostess is\nlooking round for partners. She sees the young man in the doorway; but she\nhesitates and goes to some one else; and if you asked her why, she could\nnot tell you why she avoided him. Presently the woman of thirty enters. She\nis in white satin and diamonds. She looks for him,--a circular glance,--and\ncalm with possession she passes to a seat. She dances the eighth, twelfth,\nand fifteenth waltz with him.\n\nWill he induce her to visit his rooms? Will they be like mine--strange\ndebauches of colour and Turkish lamps, Marshall's taste, an old cabinet, a\nfaded pastel which embalms the memory of a pastoral century, my taste; or\nwill it be a library,--two leather library chairs, a large escritoire,\netc.? Be this as it may, whether the apartments be the ruthless\nextravagance of artistic impulse, or the subdued taste of the student, she,\nthe woman of thirty, shall be there by night and day: her statue is there,\nand even when she is sleeping safe in her husband's arms with fevered brow,\nhe, the young man of refined mind, alone and lonely shall kneel and adore\nher.\n\nAnd should she _not_ visit his rooms? If the complex and various\naccidents of existence should have ruled out her life virtuously; if the\nmany inflections of sentiment have decided against this last consummation,\nthen she will wax to the complete, the unfathomable temptress--the Lilith\nof old--she will never set him free, and in the end will be found about his\nheart \"one single golden hair.\" She shall haunt his wife's face and words\n(should he seek to rid himself of her by marriage), a bitter sweet, a\nhalf-welcome enchantment; she shall consume and destroy the strength and\nspirit of his life, leaving it desolation, a barren landscape, burnt and\nfaintly scented with the sea. Fame and wealth shall slip like sand from\nhim. She may be set aside for the cadence of a rhyme, for the flowing line\nof a limb, but when the passion of art has raged itself out, she shall\nreturn to blight the peace of the worker.\n\nA terrible malady is she, a malady the ancients knew of and called\nnympholepsy--a beautiful name evocative and symbolic of its ideal aspect,\n\"the breast of the nymph in the brake.\" And the disease is not extinct in\nthese modern days, nor will it ever be so long as men shall yearn for the\nunattainable; and the prosy bachelors who trail their ill-fated lives from\ntheir chambers to their clubs know of, and they call their malady--the\nwoman of thirty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nA Japanese dressing gown, the ideality of whose tissue delights me, some\nfresh honey and milk set by this couch hung with royal fringes; and having\npartaken of this odorous refreshment, I call to Jack my great python that\nis crawling about after a two months' fast. I tie up a guineapig to the\n_tabouret_, pure Louis XV., the little beast struggles and squeaks,\nthe snake, his black, bead-like eyes are fixed, how superb are the\noscillations ... now he strikes, and slowly and with what exquisite\ngourmandise he lubricates and swallows.\n\nMarshall is at the organ in the hall, he is playing a Gregorian chant, that\nbeautiful hymn, the \"Vexilla Regis,\" by Saint Fortunatus, the great poet of\nthe Middle Ages. And, having turned over the leaves of \"Les F\u00c3\u00aates\nGallantes,\" I sit down to write.\n\nMy original intention was to write some thirty or forty stories varying\nfrom thirty to three hundred lines in length. The nature of these stories\nis easy to imagine: there was the youth who wandered by night into a\nwitches' sabbath, and was disputed for by the witches, young and old. There\nwas the light o' love who went into the desert to tempt the holy man; but\nhe died as he yielded, and the arms stiffening by some miracle to iron-like\nrigidity, she was unable to free herself, and died of starvation, as her\nbondage loosened in decay. And I had increased my difficulties by adopting\nas part of my task the introduction of all sorts of elaborate, and in many\ncases extravagantly composed metres, and I had begun to feel that I was\nworking in sand, I could make no progress, the house I was raising crumbled\nand fell away on every side. These stories had one merit: they were all, so\nfar as I can remember, perfectly constructed. For the art of telling a\nstory clearly and dramatically, _selon les proc\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9s de M. Scribe_, I\nhad thoroughly learnt from old M. Duval, the author of a hundred and sixty\nplays, written in collaboration with more than a hundred of the best\nwriters of his day, including the master himself, Gautier. I frequently met\nM. Duval at breakfast at a neighbouring _caf\u00c3\u00a9_, and our conversation\nturned on _l'exposition de la pi\u00c3\u00a8ce, pr\u00c3\u00a9parer la situation, nous aurons\ndes larmes_, etc. One day, as I sat waiting for him, I took up the\n_Voltaire_. It contained an article by M. Zola. _Naturalisme, la\nv\u00c3\u00a9rit\u00c3\u00a9, la science_, were repeated some half-a-dozen times. Hardly able\nto believe my eyes, I read that you should write, with as little\nimagination as possible, that plot in a novel or in a play was illiterate\nand puerile, and that the art of M. Scribe was an art of strings and wires,\netc. I rose up from breakfast, ordered my coffee, and stirred the sugar, a\nlittle dizzy, like one who has received a violent blow on the head.\n\nEcho-augury! Words heard in an unexpected quarter, but applying\nmarvellously well to the besetting difficulty of the moment. The reader who\nhas followed me so far will remember the instant effect the word \"Shelley\"\nhad upon me in childhood, and how it called into existence a train of\nfeeling that illuminated the vicissitudes and passions of many years, until\nit was finally assimilated and became part of my being; the reader will\nalso remember how the mere mention, at a certain moment, of the word\n\"France\" awoke a vital impulse, even a sense of final ordination, and how\nthe irrevocable message was obeyed, and how it led to the creation of a\nmental existence.\n\nAnd now for a third time I experienced the pain and joy of a sudden and\ninward light. Naturalism, truth, the new art, above all the phrase, \"the\nnew art,\" impressed me as with a sudden sense of light. I was dazzled, and\nI vaguely understood that my \"Roses of Midnight\" were sterile\neccentricities, dead flowers that could not be galvanised into any\nsemblance of life, passionless in all their passion.\n\nI had read a few chapters of the \"Assommoir,\" as it appeared in _La\nR\u00c3\u00a9publique des Lettres_; I had cried, \"ridiculous, abominable,\" only\nbecause it is characteristic of me to instantly form an opinion and assume\nat once a violent attitude. But now I bought up the back numbers of the\n_Voltaire_, and I looked forward to the weekly exposition of the new\nfaith with febrile eagerness. The great zeal with which the new master\ncontinued his propaganda, and the marvellous way in which subjects the most\ndiverse, passing events, political, social, religious, were caught up and\nturned into arguments for, or proof of the truth of naturalism astonished\nme wholly. The idea of a new art based upon science, in opposition to the\nart of the old world that was based on imagination, an art that should\nexplain all things and embrace modern life in its entirety, in its endless\nramifications, be, as it were, a new creed in a new civilisation, filled me\nwith wonder, and I stood dumb before the vastness of the conception, and\nthe towering height of the ambition. In my fevered fancy I saw a new race\nof writers that would arise, and with the aid of the novel would continue\nto a more glorious and legitimate conclusion the work that the prophets had\nbegun; and at each development of the theory of the new art and its\nuniversal applicability, my wonder increased and my admiration choked me.\nIf any one should be tempted to turn to the books themselves to seek an\nexplanation of this wild ecstasy, they would find nothing--as well drink\nthe dregs of yesterday's champagne. One is lying before me now, and as I\nglance through the pages listlessly I say, \"Only the simple crude\nstatements of a man of powerful mind, but singularly narrow vision.\"\n\nStill, although eager and anxious for the fray, I did not see how I was to\nparticipate in it. I was not a novelist, not yet a dramatic author, and the\npossibility of a naturalistic poet seemed to me not a little doubtful. I\nhad clearly understood that the lyrical quality was to be for ever\nbanished; there were to be no harps and lutes in our heaven, only drums;\nand the preservation of all the essentials of poetry, by the simple\nenumeration of the utensils to be found in a back kitchen, did, I could not\nhelp thinking (here it becomes necessary to whisper), sound not unlike\nrigmarole. I waited for the master to speak. He had declared that the\nRepublic would fall if it did not become instantly naturalistic; he would\nnot, he could not pass over in silence so important a branch of literature\nas poetry, no matter how contemptible he might think it. If he could find\nnothing to praise, he must at least condemn. At last the expected article\ncame. It was all that could be desired by one in my fever of mind. Hugo's\nclaims had been previously disproven, but now Banville and Gautier were\ndeclared to be warmed up dishes of the ancient world; Baudelaire was a\nnaturalist, but he had been spoilt by the romantic influence of his\ngeneration. _Cependant_ there were indications of the naturalistic\nmovement even in poetry. I trembled with excitement, I could not read fast\nenough. Copp\u00c3\u00a9e had striven to simplify language; he had versified the\nstreet cries, _Achetez la France, le Soir, le Rappel_; he had sought\nto give utterance to humble sentiments as in \"Le Petit Epicier de\nMontrouge,\" the little grocer _qui cassait le sucre avec m\u00c3\u00a9lancolie_;\nRichepin had boldly and frankly adopted the language of the people in all\nits superb crudity. All this was, however, preparatory and tentative. We\nare waiting for our poet, he who will sing to us fearlessly of the rude\nindustry of dustmen and the comestible glories of the marketplaces. The\nsubjects are to hand, the formula alone is wanting.\n\nThe prospect was a dazzling one; I tried to calm myself. Had I the stuff in\nme to win and to wear these bays, this stupendous laurel crown?--bays,\nlaurel crown, a distinct _souvenir_ of Parnassus, but there is no\nmodern equivalent, I must strive to invent a new one, in the meantime let\nme think. True it is that Swinburne was before me with the \"Romantiques.\"\nThe hymn to Proserpine and Dolores are wonderful lyrical versions of Mdlle.\nde Maupin. In form the Leper is old English, the colouring is Baudelaire,\nbut the rude industry of the dustmen and the comestible glories of the\nmarket-place shall be mine. _A bas \"Les Roses de Minuit\"_!\n\nI felt the \"naturalisation\" of the \"Roses of Midnight\" would prove a\ndifficult task. I soon found it an impossible one, and I laid the poems\naside and commenced a volume redolent of the delights of Bougival and Ville\nd'Avray. This book was to be entitled \"Poems of 'Flesh and Blood.'\"\n\n\"_Elle mit son plus beau chapeau, son chapeau bleu_\" ... and then?\nWhy, then picking up her skirt she threads her way through the crowded\nstreets, reads the advertisements on the walls, hails the omnibus, inquires\nat the _concierge's_ loge, murmurs as she goes upstairs, \"_Que c'est\nhaut le cinqi\u00c3\u00a8me_,\" and then? Why, the door opens, and she cries, \"_Je\nt'aime_.\"\n\nBut it was the idea of the new \u00c3\u00a6stheticism--the new art corresponding to\nmodern, as ancient art corresponded to ancient life--that captivated me,\nthat led me away, and not a substantial knowledge of the work done by the\nnaturalists. I had read the \"Assommoir,\" and had been much impressed by its\npyramid size, strength, height, and decorative grandeur, and also by the\nimmense harmonic development of the idea; and the fugal treatment of the\ndifferent scenes had seemed to me astonishingly new--the washhouse, for\nexample: the fight motive is indicated, then follows the development of\nside issues, then comes the fight motive explained; it is broken off short,\nit flutters through a web of progressive detail, the fight motive is again\ntaken up, and now it is worked out in all its fulness; it is worked up to\n_crescendo_, another side issue is introduced, and again the theme is\ngiven forth. And I marvelled greatly at the lordly, river-like roll of the\nnarrative, sometimes widening out into lakes and shallowing meres, but\nnever stagnating in fen or marshlands. The language, too, which I did not\nthen recognise as the weak point, being little more than a boiling down of\nChateaubriand and Flaubert, spiced with Goncourt, delighted me with its\nnovelty, its richness, its force. Nor did I then even roughly suspect that\nthe very qualities which set my admiration in a blaze wilder than wildfire,\nbeing precisely those that had won the victory for the romantic school\nforty years before, were very antagonistic to those claimed for the new\nart; I was deceived, as was all my generation, by a certain externality, an\nouter skin, a nearness, _un approchement_; in a word, by a\nsubstitution of Paris for the distant and exotic backgrounds so beloved of\nthe romantic school. I did not know then, as I do now, that art is eternal,\nthat it is only the artist that changes, and that the two great\ndivisions--the only possible divisions---are: those who have talent, and\nthose who have no talent. But I do not regret my errors, my follies; it is\nnot well to know at once of the limitations of life and things. I should be\nless than nothing had it not been for my enthusiasms; they were the saving\nclause in my life.\n\nBut although I am apt to love too dearly the art of my day, and at the cost\nof that of other days, I did not fall into the fatal mistake of placing the\nrealistic writers of 1877 side by side with and on the same plane of\nintellectual vision as the great Balzac; I felt that that vast immemorial\nmind rose above them all, like a mountain above the highest tower.\n\nAnd, strange to say, it was Gautier that introduced me to Balzac; for\nmention is made in the wonderful preface to \"Les Fleurs du Mal\" of\nSeraphita: Seraphita, Seraphitus; which is it?--woman or man? Should\nWilfred or Mona be the possessor? A new Mdlle. de Maupin, with royal lily\nand aureole, cloud-capped mountains, great gulfs of sea-water flowing up\nand reflecting as in a mirror the steep cliff's side; the straight white\nfeet are set thereon, the obscuring weft of flesh is torn, and the pure,\nstrange soul continues its mystical exhortations. Then the radiant vision,\na white glory, the last outburst and manifestation, the trumpets of the\napocalypse, the colour of heaven; the closing of the stupendous allegory\nwhen Seraphita lies dead in the rays of the first sun of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nI, therefore, had begun, as it were, to read Balzac backwards; instead of\nbeginning with the plain, simple, earthly tragedy of the P\u00c3\u00a8re Goriot, I\nfirst knelt in a beautiful but distant coigne of the great world of his\ngenius--Seraphita. Certain _nuances_ of soul are characteristic of\ncertain latitudes, and what subtle instinct led him to Norway in quest of\nthis fervent soul? The instincts of genius are unfathomable; but he who has\nknown the white northern women with their pure spiritual eyes, will aver\nthat instinct led him aright. I have known one, one whom I used to call\nSeraphita; Copp\u00c3\u00a9e knew her too, and that exquisite volume, \"L'Exil\u00c3\u00a9,\" so\nSeraphita-like in the keen blond passion of its verse, was written to her,\nand each poem was sent to her as it was written. Where is she now, that\nflower of northern snow, once seen for a season in Paris? Has she returned\nto her native northern solitudes, great gulfs of sea water, mountain rock,\nand pine?\n\nBalzac's genius is in his titles as heaven is in its stars: \"Melmoth\nReconcili\u00c3\u00a9,\" \"J\u00c3\u00a9sus-Christ en Flandres,\" \"Le Revers d'un Grand Homme,\" \"La\nCousine Bette.\" I read somewhere not very long ago, that Balzac was the\ngreatest thinker that had appeared in France since Pascal. Of Pascal's\nclaim to be a great thinker I confess I cannot judge. No man is greater\nthan the age he lives in, and, therefore, to talk to us, the legitimate\nchildren of the nineteenth century, of logical proofs of the existence of\nGod strikes us in just the same light as the logical proof of the existence\nof Jupiter Ammon. \"Les Pens\u00c3\u00a9es\" could appear to me only as infinitely\nchildish; the form is no doubt superb, but tiresome and sterile to one of\nsuch modern and exotic taste as myself. Still, I accept thankfully, in its\nsense of two hundred years, the compliment paid to Balzac; but I would add\nthat personally he seems to me to have shown greater wings of mind than any\nartist that ever lived. I am aware that this last statement will make many\ncry \"fool\" and hiss \"Shakespeare!\" But I am not putting forward these\ncriticisms axiomatically, but only as the expressions of an individual\ntaste, and interesting so far as they reveal to the reader the different\ndevelopments and the progress of my mind. It might prove a little tiresome,\nbut it would no doubt \"look well,\" in the sense that going to church \"looks\nwell,\" if I were to write in here ten pages of praise of our national bard.\nI must, however, resist the temptation to \"look well;\" a confession is\ninteresting in proportion to the amount of truth it contains, and I will,\ntherefore, state frankly I never derived any profit whatsoever, and very\nlittle pleasure from the reading of the great plays. The beauty of the\nverse! Yes; he who loved Shelley so well as I could not fail to hear the\nmelody of--\n\n    \"Music to hear, why hearest thou music sadly\n    Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.\"\n\nIs not such music as this enough? Of course but I am a sensualist in\nliterature. I may see perfectly well that this or that book is a work of\ngenius, but if it doesn't \"fetch me,\" it doesn't concern me, and I forget\nits very existence. What leaves me cold to-day will madden me to-morrow.\nWith me literature is a question of sense, intellectual sense if you will,\nbut sense all the same, and ruled by the same caprices--those of the flesh?\nNow we enter on very subtle distinctions. No doubt that there is the\nbrain-judgment and the sense-judgment of a work of art. And it will be\nnoticed that these two forces of discrimination exist sometimes almost\nindependently of each other, in rare and radiant instances confounded and\nblended in one immense and unique love. Who has not been, unless perhaps\nsome dusty old pedant, thrilled and driven to pleasure by the action of a\nbook that penetrates to and speaks to you of your most present and most\nintimate emotions. This is of course pure sensualism; but to take a less\nmarked stage. Why should Marlowe enchant me? why should he delight and\nawake enthusiasm in me, while Shakespeare leaves me cold? The mind that can\nunderstand one can understand the other, but there are affinities in\nliterature corresponding to, and very analogous to, sexual affinities--the\nsame unreasoned attractions, the same pleasures, the same lassitudes. Those\nwe have loved most we are most indifferent to. Shelley, Gautier, Zola,\nFlaubert, Goncourt! how I have loved you all; and now I could not, would\nnot, read you again. How womanly, how capricious; but even a capricious\nwoman is constant, if not faithful to her _amant de coeur_. And so\nwith me; of those I have loved deeply there is but one that still may\nthrill me with the old passion, with the first ecstacy--it is Balzac. Upon\nthat rock I built my church, and his great and valid talent saved me often\nfrom destruction, saved me from the shoaling waters of new aestheticisms,\nthe putrid mud of naturalism, and the faint and sickly surf of the\nsymbolists. Thinking of him, I could not forget that it is the spirit and\nnot the flesh that is eternal; that, as it was thought that in the first\ninstance gave man speech, so to the end it shall still be thought that\nshall make speech beautiful and rememberable. The grandeur and sublimity of\nBalzac's thoughts seem to me to rise to the loftiest heights, and his range\nis limitless; there is no passion he has not touched, and what is more\nmarvellous, he has given to each in art a place equivalent to the place it\noccupies in nature; his intense and penetrating sympathy for human life and\nall that concerns it enabled him to surround the humblest subjects with awe\nand crown them with the light of tragedy. There are some, particularly\nthose who are capable of understanding neither and can read but one, who\nwill object to any comparison being drawn between the Dramatist and the\nNovelist; but I confess that I--if the inherent superiority of verse over\nprose, which I admit unhesitatingly, be waived--that I fail, utterly fail\nto see in what Shakespeare is greater than Balzac. The range of the poet's\nthought is of necessity not so wide, and his concessions must needs be\ngreater than the novelist's. On these points we will cry quits, and come at\nonce to the vital question--the creation. Is Lucien inferior to Hamlet? Is\nEug\u00c3\u00a9nie Grandet inferior to Desdemona? Is her father inferior to Shylock?\nIs Macbeth inferior to Vautrin? Can it be said that the apothecary in the\n\"Cousine Bette,\" or the Baron Hulot, or the Cousine Bette herself is\ninferior to anything the brain of man has ever conceived? And it must not\nbe forgotten that Shakespeare has had three hundred years and the advantage\nof stage representation to impress his characters on the sluggish mind of\nthe world; and as mental impressions are governed by the same laws of\ngravitation as atoms, our realisation of Falstaff must of necessity be more\nvivid than any character in contemporary literature, although it were\nequally great. And so far as epigram and aphorism are concerned, and here I\nspeak with absolute sincerity and conviction, the work of the novelist\nseems to me richer than that of the dramatist. Who shall forget those\nterrible words of the poor life-weary orphan in the boarding-house?\nSpeaking of Vautrin she says, \"His look frightens me as if he put his hand\non my dress;\" and another epigram from the same book, \"Woman's virtue is\nman's greatest invention.\" Find me anything in La Rochefoucauld that goes\nmore incisively to the truth of things. One more; here I can give the exact\nwords: \"_La gloire est le soleil des morts._\" It would be easy to\ncompile a book of sayings from Balzac that would make all \"Maximes\" and\n\"Pens\u00c3\u00a9es,\" even those of La Rochefoucauld or Joubert, seem trivial and\nshallow.\n\nBalzac was the great moral influence of my life, and my reading culminated\nin the \"Com\u00c3\u00a9die Humaine.\" I no doubt fluttered through some scores of other\nbooks, of prose and verse, sipping a little honey, but he alone left any\nimportant or lasting impression upon my mind. The rest was like walnuts and\nwine, an agreeable aftertaste.\n\nBut notwithstanding all this reading I can lay no claim to scholarship of\nany kind; for save life I could never learn anything correctly. I am a\nstudent only of ball rooms, bar rooms, streets, and alcoves. I have read\nvery little; but all I read I can turn to account, and all I read I\nremember. To read freely, extensively, has always been my ambition, and my\nutter inability to study has always been to me a subject of grave\ninquietude,--study as contrasted with a general and haphazard gathering of\nideas taken in flight. But in me the impulse is so original to frequent the\nhaunts of men that it is irresistible, conversation is the breath of my\nnostrils, I watch the movement of life, and my ideas spring from it\nuncalled for, as buds from branches. Contact with the world is in me the\ngenerating force; without it what invention I have is thin and sterile, and\nit grows thinner rapidly, until it dies away utterly, as it did in the\ncomposition of my unfortunate \"Roses of Midnight.\"\n\nMen and women, oh the strength of the living faces! conversation, oh the\nmagic of it! It is a fabulous river of gold where the precious metal is\nwashed up without stint for all to take, to take as much as he can carry.\nTwo old ladies discussing the peerage? Much may be learned, it is gold;\npoets and wits, then it is fountains whose spray solidifies into jewels,\nand every herb and plant is begemmed with the sparkle of the diamond and\nthe glow of the ruby.\n\nI did not go to either Oxford or Cambridge, but I went to the \"Nouvelle\nAth\u00c3\u00a8nes.\" What is the \"Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes\"? He who would know anything of my\nlife must know something of the academy of the fine arts. Not the official\nstupidity you read of in the daily papers, but the real French academy, the\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9_. The \"Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes\" is a _caf\u00c3\u00a9_ on the Place Pigale.\nAh! the morning idlenesses and the long evenings when life was but a summer\nillusion, the grey moonlights on the Place where we used to stand on the\npavements, the shutters clanging up behind us, loath to separate, thinking\nof what we had left said, and how much better we might have enforced our\narguments. Dead and scattered are all those who used to assemble there, and\nthose years and our home, for it was our home, live only in a few pictures\nand a few pages of prose. The same old story, the vanquished only are\nvictorious; and though unacknowledged, though unknown, the influence of the\n\"Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes\" is inveterate in the artistic thought of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nHow magnetic, intense, and vivid are these memories of youth. With what\nstrange, almost unnatural clearness do I see and hear,--see the white face\nof that _caf\u00c3\u00a9_, the white nose of that block of houses, stretching up\nto the Place, between two streets. I can see down the incline of those two\nstreets, and I know what shops are there; I can hear the glass-door of the\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9_ grate on the sand as I open it. I can recall the smell of every\nhour. In the morning that of eggs frizzling in butter, the pungent\ncigarette, coffee and bad cognac; at five o'clock the fragrant odour of\nabsinthe; and soon after the steaming soup ascends from the kitchen; and as\nthe evening advances, the mingled smells of cigarettes, coffee, and weak\nbeer. A partition, rising a few feet or more over the hats, separates the\nglass front from the main body of the _caf\u00c3\u00a9_. The usual marble tables\nare there, and it is there we sat and aestheticised till two o'clock in the\nmorning. But who is that man? he whose prominent eyes flash with\nexcitement. That is Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. The last or the supposed last\nof the great family. He is telling that girl a story--that fair girl with\nheavy eyelids, stupid and sensual. She is, however, genuinely astonished\nand interested, and he is striving to play upon her ignorance. Listen to\nhim. \"Spain--the night is fragrant with the sea and the perfume of the\norange trees, you know--a midnight of stars and dreams. Now and then the\nsilence is broken by the sentries challenging--that is all. But not in\nSpanish but in French are the challenges given; the town is in the hands of\nthe French; it is under martial law. But now an officer passes down a\ncertain garden, a Spaniard disguised as a French officer; from the balcony\nthe family--one of the most noble and oldest families Spain can boast of, a\nthousand years, long before the conquest of the Moors--watches him. Well\nthen\"--Villiers sweeps with a white feminine hand the long hair that is\nfalling over his face--he has half forgotten, he is a little mixed in the\nopening of the story, and he is striving in English to \"scamp,\" in French\nto _escamoter_. \"The family are watching, death if he is caught, if he\nfails to kill the French sentry. The cry of a bird, some vague sound\nattracts the sentry, he turns; all is lost. The Spaniard is seized. Martial\nlaw, Spanish conspiracy must be put down. The French general is a man of\niron.\" (Villiers laughs, a short hesitating laugh that is characteristic of\nhim, and continues in his abrupt, uncertain way), \"man of iron; not only he\ndeclares that the spy must be beheaded, but also the entire family--a man\nof iron that, ha, ha; and then, no you cannot, it is impossible for you to\nunderstand the enormity of the calamity--a thousand years before the\nconquest by the Moors, a Spaniard alone could--there is no one here, ha,\nha, I was forgetting--the utter extinction of a great family of the name,\nthe oldest and noblest of all the families in Spain, it is not easy to\nunderstand that, no, not easy here in the 'Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes'--ha, ha, one\nmust belong to a great family to understand, ha, ha.\n\n\"The father beseeches; he begs that one member may be spared to continue\nthe name--the youngest son--that is all; if he could be saved, the rest\nwhat matter; death is nothing to a Spaniard; the family, the name, a\nthousand years of name is everything. The general is, you know, a 'man of\niron.' 'Yes, one member of your family shall be respited, but on one\ncondition.' To the agonised family conditions are as nothing. But they\ndon't know the man of iron is determined to make a terrible example, and\nthey cry, 'Any conditions.' 'He who is respited must serve as executioner\nto the others.' Great is the doom; you understand; but after all the name\nmust be saved. Then in the family council the father goes to his youngest\nson and says, 'I have been a good father to you, my son; I have always been\na kind father, have I not? answer me; I have never refused you anything.\nNow you will not fail us, you will prove yourself worthy of the great name\nyou bear. Remember your great ancestor who defeated the Moors, remember.'\"\n(Villiers strives to get in a little local colour, but his knowledge of\nSpanish names and history is limited, and he in a certain sense fails.)\n\"Then the mother comes to her son and says, 'My son, I have been a good\nmother, I have always loved you; say you will not desert us in this hour of\nour great need.' Then the little sister comes, and the whole family kneels\ndown and appeals to the horror-stricken boy....\n\n\"'He will not prove himself unworthy of our name,' cries the father. 'Now,\nmy son, courage, take the axe firmly, do what I ask you, courage, strike\nstraight.' The father's head falls into the sawdust, the blood all over the\nwhite beard; then comes the elder brother, and then another brother; and\nthen, oh, the little sister was almost more than he could bear, and the\nmother had to whisper, 'Remember your promise to your father, to your dead\nfather.' The mother laid her head on the block, but he could not strike.\n'Be not the first coward of our name, strike; remember your promise to us\nall,' and her head was struck off.\"\n\n\"And the son,\" the girl asks, \"what became of him?\"\n\n\"He never was seen, save at night, walking, a solitary man, beneath the\nwalls of his castle in Granada.\"\n\n\"And whom did he marry?\"\n\n\"He never married.\"\n\nThen after a long silence some one said,--\n\n\"Whose story is that?\"\n\n\"Balzac's.\"\n\nAt that moment the glass door of the _caf\u00c3\u00a9_ grated upon the sanded\nfloor, and Manet entered. Although by birth and by art essentially\nParisian, there was something in his appearance and manner of speaking that\noften suggested an Englishman. Perhaps it was his dress--his clean-cut\nclothes and figure. That figure! those square shoulders that swaggered as\nhe went across a room and the thin waist; and that face, the beard and\nnose, satyr-like shall I say? No, for I would evoke an idea of beauty of\nline united to that of intellectual expression--frank words, frank passion\nin his convictions, loyal and simple phrases, clear as well-water,\nsometimes a little hard, sometimes, as they flowed away, bitter, but at the\nfountain head sweet and full of light. He sits next to Degas, that\nround-shouldered man in suit of pepper and salt. There is nothing very\ntrenchantly French about him either, except the large necktie; his eyes are\nsmall and his words are sharp, ironical, cynical. These two men are the\nleaders of the impressionist school. Their friendship has been jarred by\ninevitable rivalry. \"Degas was painting 'Semiramis' when I was painting\n'Modern Paris,'\" says Manet. \"Manet is in despair because he cannot paint\natrocious pictures like Durant, and be f\u00c3\u00aated and decorated; he is an\nartist, not by inclination, but by force. He is as a galley slave chained\nto the oar,\" says Degas. Different too are their methods of work. Manet\npaints his whole picture from nature, trusting his instinct to lead him\naright through the devious labyrinth of selection. Nor does his instinct\never fail him, there is a vision in his eyes which he calls nature, and\nwhich he paints unconsciously as he digests his food, thinking and\ndeclaring vehemently that the artist should not seek a synthesis, but\nshould paint merely what he sees. This extraordinary oneness of nature and\nartistic vision does not exist in Degas, and even his portraits are\ncomposed from drawings and notes. About midnight Catulle Mend\u00c3\u00a8s will drop\nin, when he has corrected his proofs. He will come with his fine paradoxes\nand his strained eloquence. He will lean towards you, he will take you by\nthe arm, and his presence is a nervous pleasure. And when the _caf\u00c3\u00a9_\nis closed, when the last bock has been drunk, we shall walk about the great\nmoonlight of the Place Pigale, and through the dark shadows of the streets,\ntalking of the last book published, he hanging on to my arm, speaking in\nthat high febrile voice of his, every phrase luminous, aerial, even as the\nsoaring moon and the fitful clouds. Duranty, an unknown Stendal, will come\nin for an hour or so; he will talk little and go away quietly; he knows,\nand his whole manner shows that he knows that he is a defeated man; and if\nyou ask him why he does not write another novel, he will say, \"What's the\ngood, it would not be read; no one read the others, and I mightn't do even\nas well if I tried again.\" Paul Alexis, L\u00c3\u00a9on Diex, Pissarro, Cabaner, are\nalso frequently seen in the \"Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes.\"\n\nCabaner! the world knows not the names of those who scorn the world:\nsomewhere in one of the great populous churchyards of Paris there is a\nforgotten grave, and there lies Cabaner. Cabaner! since the beginning there\nhave been, till the end of time there shall be Cabaners; and they shall\nlive miserably and they shall die miserable, and shall be forgotten; and\nthere shall never arise a novelist great enough to make live in art that\neternal spirit of devotion, disinterestedness, and aspiration, which in\neach generation incarnates itself in one heroic soul. Better than those who\nstepped to opulence and fame upon thee fallen thou wert; better,\nloftier-minded, purer; thy destiny was to fall that others might rise upon\nthee, thou wert one of the noble legion of the conquered; let praise be\ngiven to the conquered, for the brunt of victory lies with the conquered.\nChild of the pavement, of strange sonnets and stranger music, I remember\nthee; I remember the silk shirts, the four sous of Italian cheese, the roll\nof bread, and the glass of milk;--the streets were thy dining-room. And the\nfive-mile walk daily to the suburban music hall where five francs were\nearned by playing the accompaniments of comic songs. And the wonderful room\non the fifth floor, which was furnished when that celebrated heritage of\ntwo thousand francs was paid. I remember the fountain that was bought for a\nwardrobe, and the American organ with all the instruments of the orchestra,\nand the plaster casts under which the homeless ones that were never denied\na refuge and a crust by thee slept. I remember all, and the buying of the\nlife-size \"Venus de Milo.\" Something extraordinary would be done with it, I\nknew, but the result exceeded my wildest expectation. The head must needs\nbe struck off, so that the rapture of thy admiration should be secure from\nall jarring reminiscence of the streets.\n\nThen the wonderful story of the tenor, the pork butcher, who was heard\ngiving out such a volume of sound that the sausages were set in motion\nabove him; he was fed, clothed, and educated on the five francs a day\nearned in the music hall in the Avenue de la Motte Piquet; and when he made\nhis _d\u00c3\u00a9but_ at the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre Lyrique, thou wert in the last stage of\nconsumption and too ill to go to hear thy pupil's success. He was\nimmediately engaged by Mapleson and taken to America.\n\nI remember thy face, Cabaner; I can see it now--that long sallow face\nending in a brown beard, and the hollow eyes, the meagre arms covered with\na silk shirt, contrasting strangely with the rest of the dress. In all thy\nprivation and poverty, thou didst never forego thy silk shirt. I remember\nthe paradoxes and the aphorisms, if not the exact words, the glamour and\nthe sentiment of a humour that was all thy own. Never didst thou laugh; no,\nnot even when in discussing how silence might be rendered in music, thou\ndidst say, with thy extraordinary Pyrenean accent, \"_Pour rendre le\nsilence en music il me faudrait trois orchestres militaires._\" And when\nI did show thee some poor verses of mine, French verses, for at this time I\nhated and had partly forgotten my native language--\n\n\"My dear Dayne, you always write about love, the subject is nauseating.\"\n\n\"So it is, so it is; but after all Baudelaire wrote about love and lovers;\nhis best poem....\"\n\n\"_C'est vrai, mais il s'agissait d'une charogne et cela rel\u00c3\u00a8ve beaucoup\nla chose._\"\n\nI remember, too, a few stray snatches of thy extraordinary music, \"music\nthat might be considered by Wagner as a little too advanced, but which\nLiszt would not fail to understand;\" also thy settings of sonnets where the\n_melody_ was continued uninterruptedly from the first line to the\nlast; and that still more marvellous feat, thy setting, likewise with\nunbroken melody, of Villon's ballade \"Les Dames du Temps Jadis;\" and that\nOut-Cabanering of Cabaner, the putting to music of Cros's \"Hareng Saur.\"\n\nAnd why didst thou remain ever poor and unknown? Because of something too\nmuch, or something too little? Because of something too much! so I think,\nat least; thy heart was too full of too pure an ideal, too far removed from\nall possible contagion with the base crowd.\n\nBut, Cabaner, thou didst not labour in vain; thy destiny, though obscure,\nwas a valiant and fruitful one; and, as in life, thou didst live for others\nso now in death thou dost live in others. Thou wert in an hour of wonder\nand strange splendour when the last tints and lovelinesses of romance\nlingered in the deepening west; when out of the clear east rose with a\nmighty effulgence of colour and lawless light Realism; when showing aloft\nin the dead pallor of the zenith, like a white flag fluttering faintly,\nSymbolists and Decadents appeared. Never before was there so sudden a flux\nand conflux of artistic desire, such aspiration in the soul of man, such\nrage of passion, such fainting fever, such cerebral erethism. The roar and\ndust of the daily battle of the Realists was continued under the flush of\nthe sunset, the arms of the Romantics glittered, the pale spiritual\nSymbolists watched and waited, none knowing yet of their presence. In such\nan hour of artistic convulsion and renewal of thought thou wert, and thou\nwert a magnificent rallying point for all comers; it was thou who didst\ntheorise our confused aspirations, and by thy holy example didst save us\nfrom all base commercialism, from all hateful prostitution; thou wert ever\nour high priest, and from thy high altar turned to us the white host, the\nideal, the true and living God of all men.\n\nCabaner, I see you now entering the \"Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes;\" you are a little\ntired after your long weary walk, but you lament not and you never cry out\nagainst the public that will accept neither your music nor your poetry. But\nthough you are tired and footsore, you are ready to aestheticise till the\n_caf\u00c3\u00a9_ closes; for you the homeless ones are waiting: there they are,\nsome three or four, and you will take them to your strange room, furnished\nwith the American organ, the fountain, and the decapitated Venus, and you\ngive them a crust each and cover them with what clothes you have; and, when\nclothes are lacking, with plaster casts, and though you will take but a\nglass of milk yourself, you will find a few sous to give them _lager_\nto cool their thirsty throats. So you have ever lived--a blameless life is\nyours, no base thought has ever entered there, not even a woman's love; art\nand friends, that is all.\n\nReader, do you know of anything more angelic? If you do you are more\nfortunate than I have been.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nTHE SYNTHESIS OF THE NOUVELLE ATH\u00c3\u0088NES\n\nTwo dominant notes in my character--an original hatred of my native\ncountry, and a brutal loathing of the religion I was brought up in. All the\naspects of my native country are violently disagreeable to me, and I cannot\nthink of the place I was born in without a sensation akin to nausea. These\nfeelings are inherent and inveterate in me. I am instinctively averse to my\nown countrymen; they are at once remote and repulsive; but with Frenchmen I\nam conscious of a sense of nearness; I am one with them in their ideas and\naspirations, and when I am with them, I am alive with a keen and\npenetrating sense of intimacy. Shall I explain this by atavism? Was there a\nFrench man or woman in my family some half dozen generations ago? I have\nnot inquired. The English I love, and with a love that is foolish--mad,\nlimitless; I love them better than the French, but I am not so near to\nthem. Dear, sweet Protestant England, the red tiles of the farmhouse, the\nelms, the great hedgerows, and all the rich fields adorned with spreading\ntrees, and the weald and the wold, the very words are passionately\nbeautiful ... southern England, not the north--there is something Celtic in\nthe north,--southern England, with its quiet, steadfast faces;--a smock\nfrock is to me one of the most delightful things in the world; it is so\nabsolutely English. The villages clustered round the greens, the spires of\nthe churches pointing between the elm trees.... This is congenial to me;\nand this is Protestantism. England is Protestantism, Protestantism is\nEngland. Protestantism is strong, clean, and westernly, Catholicism is\neunuch-like, dirty, and Oriental.... Yes, Oriental; there is something even\nChinese about it. What made England great was Protestantism, and when she\nceases to be Protestant she will fall.... Look at the nations that have\nclung to Catholicism, starving moonlighters and starving brigands. The\nProtestant flag floats on every ocean breeze, the Catholic banner hangs\nlimp in the incense silence of the Vatican. Let us be Protestant, and\nrevere Cromwell.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Gar\u00c3\u00a7on, un bock!_ I write to please myself, just as I order my\ndinner; if my books sell I cannot help it--it is an accident.\n\nBut you live by writing.\n\nYes, but life is only an accident--art is eternal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat I reproach Zola with is that he has no style; there is nothing you\nwon't find in Zola from Chateaubriand to the reporting in the\n_Figaro_.\n\nHe seeks immortality in an exact description of a linendraper's shop; if\nthe shop conferred immortality it should be upon the linendraper who\ncreated the shop, and not on the novelist who described it.\n\nAnd his last novel \"l'Oeuvre,\" how terribly spun out, and for a franc a\nline in the \"Gil Blas.\" Not a single new or even exact observation. And\nthat terrible phrase repeated over and over again--\"La Conqu\u00c3\u00aate de Paris.\"\nWhat does it mean? I never knew any one who thought of conquering\nParis;--no one ever spoke of conquering Paris except, perhaps, two or three\nprovincials.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou must have rules in poetry, if it is only for the pleasure of breaking\nthem, just as you must have women dressed, if it is only for the pleasure\nof imagining them as Venuses.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFancy, a banquet was given to Julien by his pupils! He made a speech in\nfavour of Lefevre, and hoped that every one there would vote for Lefevre.\nJulien was very eloquent. He spoke of _Le grand art, le nu_, and\nLefevre's unswerving fidelity to _le nu_ ... elegance, refinement, an\necho of ancient Greece: and then,--what do you think? when he had exhausted\nall the reasons why the medal of honour should be accorded to Lefevre, he\nsaid, \"I ask you to remember, gentlemen, that he has a wife and eight\nchildren.\" Is it not monstrous?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it is you who are monstrous, you who expect to fashion the whole world\nin conformity with your aestheticisms ... a vain dream, and if realised it\nwould result in an impossible world. A wife and children are the basis of\nexistence, and it is folly to cry out because an appeal to such interests\nas these meet with response ... it will be so till the end of time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd these great interests that are to continue to the end of time began two\nyears ago, when your pictures were not praised in the _Figaro_ as much\nas you thought they should be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarriage--what an abomination! Love--yes, but not marriage. Love cannot\nexist in marriage, because love is an ideal; that is to say, something not\nquite understood--transparencies, colour, light, a sense of the unreal. But\na wife--you know all about her--who her father was, who her mother was,\nwhat she thinks of you and her opinion of the neighbours over the way.\nWhere, then, is the dream, the _au del\u00c3\u00a0_? There is none. I say in\nmarriage an _au del\u00c3\u00a0_ is impossible ... the endless duet of the marble\nand the water, the enervation of burning odours, the baptismal whiteness of\nwomen, light, ideal tissues, eyes strangely dark with kohl, names that\nevoke palm trees and ruins, Spanish moonlight or maybe Persepolis. The\nmonosyllable which epitomises the ennui and the prose of our lives is heard\nnot, thought not there--only the nightingale-harmony of an eternal yes.\nFreedom limitless; the Mahometan stands on the verge of the abyss, and the\nspaces of perfume and colour extend and invite him with the whisper of a\nsweet unending yes. The unknown, the unreal.... Thus love is possible,\nthere is a delusion, an _au del\u00c3\u00a0_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGood heavens! and the world still believes in education, in teaching people\nthe \"grammar of art.\" Education is fatal to any one with a spark of\nartistic feeling. Education should be confined to clerks, and even them it\ndrives to drink. Will the world learn that we never learn anything that we\ndid not know before? The artist, the poet, painter, musician, and novelist\ngo straight to the food they want, guided by an unerring and ineffable\ninstinct; to teach them is to destroy the nerve of the artistic instinct,\nit is fatal. But above all in painting ... \"correct drawing,\" \"solid\npainting.\" Is it impossible to teach people, to force it into their heads\nthat there is no such thing as correct drawing, and that if drawing were\ncorrect it would be wrong? Solid painting; good heavens! Do they suppose\nthat there is one sort of painting that is better than all others, and that\nthere is a receipt for making it as for making chocolate! Art is not\nmathematics, it is individuality. It does not matter how badly you paint,\nso long as you don't paint badly like other people. Education destroys\nindividuality. That great studio of Julien's is a sphinx, and all the poor\nfolk that go there for artistic education are devoured. After two years\nthey all paint and draw alike, every one; that vile execution,--they call\nit execution,--_la p\u00c3\u00a2et, la peinture au premier coup_. I was over in\nEngland last year, and I saw some portraits by a man called Richmond. They\nwere horrible, but I liked them because they weren't like painting. Stott\nand Sargent are clever fellows enough; I like Stott the best. If they had\nremained at home and hadn't been taught, they might have developed a\npersonal art, but the trail of the serpent is over all they do--that vile\nFrench painting, _le morceau_, etc. Stott is getting over it by\ndegrees. He exhibited a nymph this year. I know what he meant; it was an\ninteresting intention. I liked his little landscapes better ... simplified\ninto nothing, into a couple of primitive tints, wonderful clearness, light.\nBut I doubt if he will find a public to understand all that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDemocratic art! Art is the direct antithesis to democracy.... Athens! a few\nthousand citizens who owned many thousand slaves, call that democracy! No!\nwhat I am speaking of is modern democracy--the mass. The mass can only\nappreciate simple and _na\u00c3\u00afve_ emotions, puerile prettiness, above all\nconventionalities. See the Americans that come over here; what do they\nadmire? Is it Degas or Manet they admire? No, Bouguereau and Lefevre. What\nwas most admired at the International Exhibition?--The Dirty Boy. And if\nthe medal of honour had been decided by a _pl\u00c3\u00a9biscite_, the dirty boy\nwould have had an overwhelming majority. What is the literature of the\npeople? The idiotic stories of the _Petit Journal_. Don't talk of\nShakespeare, Moli\u00c3\u00a8re, and the masters; they are accepted on the authority\nof the centuries. If the people could understand _Hamlet_, the people\nwould not read the _Petit Journal_; if the people could understand\nMichel Angelo, they would not look at our Bouguereau or your Bouguereau,\nSir F. Leighton. For the last hundred years we have been going rapidly\ntowards democracy, and what is the result? The destruction of the\nhandicrafts. That there are still good pictures painted and good poems\nwritten proves nothing, there will always be found men to sacrifice their\nlives for a picture or a poem. But the decorative arts which are executed\nin collaboration, and depend for support on the general taste of a large\nnumber, have ceased to exist. Explain that if you can. I'll give you five\nthousand, ten thousand francs to buy a beautiful clock that is not a copy\nand is not ancient, and you can't do it. Such a thing does not exist. Look\nhere; I was going up the staircase of the Louvre the other day. They were\nputting up a mosaic; it was horrible; every one knows it is horrible. Well,\nI asked who had given the order for this mosaic, and I could not find out;\nno one knew. An order is passed from bureau to bureau, and no one is\nresponsible; and it will be always so in a republic, and the more\nrepublican you are the worse it will be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe world is dying of machinery; that is the great disease, that is the\nplague that will sweep away and destroy civilisation; man will have to rise\nagainst it sooner or later.... Capital, unpaid labour, wage-slaves, and all\nthe rest--stuff.... Look at these plates; they were painted by machinery;\nthey are abominable. Look at them. In old times plates were painted by the\nhand, and the supply was necessarily limited to the demand, and a china in\nwhich there was always something more or less pretty, was turned out; but\nnow thousands, millions of plates are made more than we want, and there is\na commercial crisis; the thing is inevitable. I say the great and the\nreasonable revolution will be when mankind rises in revolt, and smashes the\nmachinery and restores the handicrafts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGoncourt is not an artist, notwithstanding all his affectation and\noutcries; he is not an artist. _Il me fait l'effet_ of an old woman\nshrieking after immortality and striving to beat down some fragment of it\nwith a broom. Once it was a duet, now it is a solo. They wrote novels,\nhistory, plays, they collected _bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac_--they wrote about their\n_bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac_; they painted in water-colours, they etched--they wrote\nabout their water-colours and etchings; they have made a will settling that\nthe _bric-\u00c3\u00a0-brac_ is to be sold at their death, and the proceeds\napplied to founding a prize for the best essay or novel, I forget which it\nis. They wrote about the prize they are going to found; they kept a diary,\nthey wrote down everything they heard, felt, or saw, _radotage de vieille\nfemme_; nothing must escape, not the slightest word; it might be that\nvery word that might confer on them immortality; everything they heard, or\nsaid, must be of value, of inestimable value. A real artist does not\ntrouble himself about immortality, about everything he hears, feels, and\nsays; he treats ideas and sensations as so much clay wherewith to create.\n\nAnd then the famous collaboration; how it was talked about, written about,\nprayed about; and when Jules died, what a subject for talk for articles; it\nall went into pot. Hugo's vanity was Titanic, Goncourt's is puerile.\n\nAnd Daudet?\n\nOh, Daudet, _c'est de la bouillabaisse_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhistler, of all artists, is the least impressionist; the idea people have\nof his being an impressionist only proves once again the absolute inability\nof the public to understand the merits or the demerits of artistic work.\nWhistler's art is absolutely classical; he thinks of nature, but he does\nnot see nature; he is guided by his mind, and not by his eyes; and the best\nof it is he says so. Oh, he knows it well enough! Any one who knows him\nmust have heard him say, \"Painting is absolutely scientific; it is an exact\nscience.\" And his work is in accord with his theory; he risks nothing, all\nis brought down, arranged, balanced, and made one,--a well-determined\nmental conception, I admire his work; I am merely showing how he is\nmisunderstood, even by those who think they understand. Does he ever seek a\npose that is characteristic of the model, a pose that the model repeats\noftener than any other?--Never. He advances the foot, puts the hand on the\nhip, etc., with a view to rendering his _idea_. Take his portrait of\nDuret. Did he ever see Duret in dress clothes? Probably not. Did he ever\nsee Duret with a lady's opera cloak?--I am sure he never did. Is Duret in\nthe habit of going to the theatre with ladies? No; he is a\n_litt\u00c3\u00a9rateur_ who is always in men's society, rarely in ladies'. But\nthese facts mattered nothing to Whistler as they matter to Degas, or to\nManet. Whistler took Duret out of his environment, dressed him up, thought\nout a scheme--in a word, painted his idea without concerning himself in the\nleast with the model. Mark you, I deny that I am urging any fault or flaw;\nI am merely contending that Whistler's art is not modern art, but classic\nart--yes, and severely classical, far more classical than Titian's or\nVelasquez;--from an opposite pole as classical as Ingres. No Greek\ndramatist ever sought the synthesis of things more uncompromisingly than\nWhistler. And he is right. Art is not nature. Art is nature digested. Art\nis a sublime excrement. Zola and Goncourt cannot, or will not understand\nthat the artistic stomach must be allowed to do its work in its own\nmysterious fashion. If a man is really an artist he will remember what is\nnecessary, forget what is useless; but if he takes notes he will interrupt\nhis artistic digestion, and the result will be a lot of little touches,\ninchoate and wanting in the elegant rhythm of the synthesis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am sick of synthetical art; we want observation direct and unreasoned.\nWhat I reproach Millet with is that it is always the same thing, the same\npeasant, the same _sabot_, the same sentiment. You must admit that it\nis somewhat stereotyped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat does that matter; what is more stereotyped than Japanese art? But that\ndoes not prevent it from being always beautiful.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPeople talk of Manet's originality; that is just what I can't see. What he\nhas got, and what you can't take away from him, is a magnificent execution.\nA piece of still life by Manet is the most wonderful thing in the world;\nvividness of colour, breadth, simplicity, and directness of\ntouch--marvellous!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrench translation is the only translation; in England you still continue\nto translate poetry into poetry, instead of into prose. We used to do the\nsame, but we have long ago renounced such follies. Either of two things--if\nthe translator is a good poet, he substitutes his verse for that of the\noriginal;--I don't want his verse, I want the original;--if he is a bad\npoet, he gives us bad verse, which is intolerable. Where the original poet\nput an effect of caesura, the translator puts an effect of rhyme; where the\noriginal poet puts an effect of rhyme, the translator puts an effect of\ncaesura. Take Longfellow's \"Dante.\" Does it give as good an idea of the\noriginal as our prose translation? Is it as interesting reading? Take\nBayard Taylor's translation of \"Goethe.\" Is it readable? Not to any one\nwith an ear for verse. Will any one say that Taylor's would be read if the\noriginal did not exist. The fragment translated by Shelley is beautiful,\nbut then it is Shelley. Look at Swinburne's translations of Villon. They\nare beautiful poems by Swinburne, that is all; he makes Villon speak of a\n\"splendid kissing mouth.\" Villon could not have done this unless he had\nread Swinburne. \"Heine,\" translated by James Thomson, is not different from\nThomson's original poems; \"Heine,\" translated by Sir Theodore Martin, is\ndoggerel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut in English blank verse you can translate quite as literally as you\ncould into prose?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI doubt it, but even so, the rhythm of the blank line would carry your mind\naway from that of the original.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut if you don't know the original?\n\nThe rhythm of the original can be suggested in prose judiciously used; even\nif it isn't, your mind is at least free, whereas the English rhythm must\ndestroy the sensation of something foreign. There is no translation except\na word-for-word translation. Baudelaire's translation of Poe, and Hugo's\ntranslation of Shakespeare, are marvellous in this respect; a pun or joke\nthat is untranslatable is explained in a note.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut that is the way young ladies translate--word for word!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo; 'tis just what they don't do; they think they are translating word for\nword, but they aren't. All the proper names, no matter how unpronounceable,\nmust be rigidly adhered to; you must never transpose versts into\nkilometres, or roubles into francs;--I don't know what a verst is or what a\nrouble is, but when I see the words I am in Russia. Every proverb must be\nrendered literally, even if it doesn't make very good sense; if it doesn't\nmake sense at all, it must be explained in a note. For example, there is a\nproverb in German: \"_Quand le cheval est sell\u00c3\u00a9 il faut le monter_;\" in\nFrench there is a proverb: \"_Quand le vin est tir\u00c3\u00a9 il faut le boire._\"\nWell, a translator who would translate _quand le cheval_, etc., by\n_quand le vin_, etc., is an ass, and does not know his business. In\ntranslation, only a strictly classical language should be used; no word of\nslang, or even word of modern origin should be employed; the translator's\naim should be never to dissipate the illusion of an exotic. If I were\ntranslating the \"Assommoir\" into English, I should strive after a strong,\nflexible, but colourless language, something--what shall I say?--a sort of\na modern Addison.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat, don't you know the story about Mend\u00c3\u00a9s?--when _Chose_ wanted to\nmarry his sister? _Chose's_ mother, it appears, went to live with a\npriest. The poor fellow was dreadfully cut up; he was brokenhearted; and he\nwent to Mend\u00c3\u00a9s, his heart swollen with grief, determined to make a clean\nbreast of it, let the worst come to the worst. After a great deal of\nbeating about the bush, and apologising, he got it out. You know Mend\u00c3\u00a9s,\nyou can see him smiling a little; and looking at _Chose_ with that\nwhite cameo face of his he said, \"_Avec quel meilleur homme voulez-vous\nque votre m\u00c3\u00a8re se fit? vous n'avez donc, jeune homme, aucun sentiment\nreligieux._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVictor Hugo, he is a painter on porcelain; his verse is mere decoration,\nlong tendrils and flowers; and the same thing over and over again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow to be happy!--not to read Baudelaire and Verlaine, not to enter the\n_Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes_, unless perhaps to play dominoes like the\n_bourgeois_ over there, not to do anything that would awake a too\nintense consciousness of life,--to live in a sleepy country side, to have a\ngarden to work in, to have a wife and children, to chatter quietly every\nevening over the details of existence. We must have the azaleas out\nto-morrow and thoroughly cleansed, they are devoured by insects; the tame\nrook has flown away; mother lost her prayer-book coming from church, she\nthinks it was stolen. A good, honest, well-to-do peasant, who knows nothing\nof politics, must be very nearly happy;--and to think there are people who\nwould educate, who would draw these people out of the calm satisfaction of\ntheir instincts, and give them passions! The philanthropist is the Nero of\nmodern times.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER\n\nWhy did you not send a letter? We have all been writing to you for the last\nsix months, but no answer--none. Had you written one word I would have\nsaved all. The poor concierge was in despair; she said the\n_propri\u00c3\u00a9taire_ would wait if you had only said when you were coming\nback, or if you only had let us know what you wished to be done. Three\nquarters rent was due, and no news could be obtained of you, so an auction\nhad to be called. It nearly broke my heart to see those horrid men tramping\nover the delicate carpets, their coarse faces set against the sweet colour\nof that beautiful English cretonne.... And all the while the pastel by\nManet, the great hat set like an aureole about the face--'the eyes deep set\nin crimson shadow,' 'the fan widespread across the bosom' (you see I am\nquoting your own words), looking down, the mistress of that little paradise\nof tapestry. She seemed to resent the intrusion. I looked once or twice\nhalf expecting those eyes 'deep set in crimson shadow' to fill with tears.\nBut nothing altered her great dignity; she seemed to see all, but as a\nBuddha she remained impenetrable....\n\n\"I was there the night before the sale. I looked through the hooks, taking\nnotes of those I intended to buy--those which we used to read together when\nthe snow lay high about the legs of the poor faun in _terre cuite_,\nthat laughed amid the frosty _boulingrins_. I found a large packet of\nletters which I instantly destroyed. You should not be so careless; I\nwonder how it is that men are always careless about their letters.\n\n\"The sale was announced for one o'clock. I wore a thick veil, for I did not\nwish to be recognised; the concierge of course knew me, but she can be\ndepended upon. The poor old woman was in tears, so sorry was she to see all\nyour pretty things sold up. You left owing her a hundred francs, but I have\npaid her; and talking of you we waited till the auctioneer arrived.\nEverything had been pulled down; the tapestry from the walls, the picture,\nthe two vases I gave you were on the table waiting the stroke of the\nhammer. And then the men, all the _marchands de meubles_ in the\n_quartier_, came upstairs, spitting and talking coarsely--their foul\nvoices went through me. They stamped, spat, pulled the things about,\nnothing escaped them. One of them held up the Japanese dressing-gown and\nmade some horrible jokes; and the auctioneer, who was a humorist, answered,\n\"If there are any ladies' men present, we shall have some spirited\nbidding.\" The pastel I bought, and I shall keep it and try to find some\nexcuse to satisfy my husband, but I send you the miniature, and I hope you\nwill not let it be sold again. There were many other things I should have\nliked to have bought but I did not dare--the organ that you used to play\nhymns on and I waltzes on, the Turkish lamp which we could never agree\nabout ... but when I saw the satin shoes which I gave you to carry the\nnight of that adorable ball, and which you would not give back, but nailed\nup on the wall on either side of your bed and put matches in, I was seized\nwith an almost invincible desire to steal them. I don't know why, _un\ncaprice de femme_. No one but you would have ever thought of converting\nsatin shoes into match boxes. I wore them at that delicious ball; we danced\nall night together, and you had an explanation with my husband (I was a\nlittle afraid for a moment, but it came out all right), and we went and sat\non the balcony in the soft warm moonlight; we watched the glitter of\nepaulets and gas, the satin of the bodices, the whiteness of passing\nshoulders; we dreamed the massy darknesses of the park, the fairy light\nalong the lawny spaces, the heavy perfume of the flowers, the pink of the\ncamellias; and you quoted something: '_les cam\u00c3\u00a9lias du balcon ressemblent\n\u00c3\u00a0 des d\u00c3\u00a9sirs mourants._' It was horrid of you: but you always had a\nknack of rubbing one up the wrong way. Then do you not remember how we\ndanced in one room, while the servants set the other out with little\ntables? That supper was fascinating! I suppose it was these pleasant\nremembrances which made me wish for the shoes, but I could not summon up\ncourage enough to buy them, and the horrid people were comparing me with\nthe pastel; I suppose I did look a little mysterious with a double veil\nbound across my face. The shoes went with a lot of other things--and oh, to\nwhom?\n\n\"So now that pretty little retreat in the _Rue de la Tour des Dames_\nis ended for ever for you and me. We shall not see the faun in _terre\ncuite_ again; I was thinking of going to see him the other day, but the\nstreet is so steep; my coachman advised me to spare the horse's hind legs.\nI believe it is the steepest street in Paris. And your luncheon parties,\nhow I did enjoy them, and how Fay did enjoy them too; and what I risked,\nshortsighted as I am, picking my way from the tramcar down to that\nout-of-the-way little street! Men never appreciate the risks women run for\nthem. But to leave my letters lying about--I cannot forgive that. When I\ntold Fay she said, 'What can you expect? I warned you against flirting with\nboys.' I never did before--never.\n\n\"Paris is now just as it was when you used to sit on the balcony and I read\nyou Browning. You never liked his poetry, and I cannot understand why. I\nhave found a new poem which I am sure would convert you; you should be\nhere. There are lilacs in the room and the _Mont Val\u00c3\u00a9rien_ is\nbeautiful upon a great lemon sky, and the long avenue is merging into\nviolet vapour.\n\n\"We have already begun to think of where we shall go to this year. Last\nyear we went to P----, an enchanting place, quite rustic, but within easy\ndistance of a casino. I had vowed not to dance, for I had been out every\nnight during the season, but the temptation proved irresistible, and I gave\nway. There were two young men here, one the Count of B----, the other the\nMarquis of G----, one of the best families in France, a distant cousin of\nmy husband. He has written a book which every one says is one of the most\namusing things that has appeared for years, _c'est surtout tr\u00c3\u00a8s\nParisien_. He paid me great attentions, and made my husband wildly\njealous. I used to go out and sit with him amid the rocks, and it was\nperhaps very lucky for me that he went away. We may return there this year;\nif so, I wish you would come and spend a month; there is an excellent hotel\nwhere you would be very comfortable. We have decided nothing as yet. The\nDuchesse de ---- is giving a costume ball; they say it is going to be a most\nwonderful affair. I don't know what money is not going to be spent upon the\ncotillion. I have just got home a fascinating toilette. I am going as a\n_Pierrotte_; you know, a short skirt and a little cap. The Marquise\ngave a ball some few days ago. I danced the cotillion with L----, who, as\nyou know, dances divinely; _il m'a fait la cour_, but it is of course\nno use, you know that.\n\n\"The other night we went to see the _Ma\u00c3\u00aetre-Forges_, a fascinating\nplay, and I am reading the book; I don't know which I like the best. I\nthink the play, but the book is very good too. Now that is what I call a\nnovel; and I am a judge, for I have read all novels. But I must not talk\nliterature, or you will say something stupid. I wish you would not make\nfoolish remarks about men that _tout-Paris_ considers the cleverest.\nIt does not matter so much with me, I know you, but then people laugh at\nyou behind your back, and that is not nice for me. The _marquise_ was\nhere the other day, and she said she almost wished you would not come on\nher 'days,' so extraordinary were the remarks you made. And by the way, the\n_marquise_ has written a book. I have not seen it, but I hear that it\nis really too _d\u00c3\u00a9collet\u00c3\u00a9_. She is _une femme d'esprit_, but the\nway she affich\u00c3\u00a9's herself is too much for any one. She never goes anywhere\nnow without _le petit_ D----. It is a great pity.\n\n\"And now, my dear friend, write me a nice letter, and tell me when you are\ncoming back to Paris. I am sure you cannot amuse yourself in that hateful\nLondon; the nicest thing about you was that you were really _tr\u00c3\u00a8s_\nParisien. Come back and take a nice apartment on the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es. You\nmight come back for the Duchesse's ball. I will get an invitation for you,\nand will keep the cotillion for you. The idea of running away as you did,\nand never telling any one where you were going to. I always said you were a\nlittle cracked. And letting all your things be sold! If you had only told\nme! I should like so much to have had that Turkish lamp. Yours--\"\n\n\nHow like her that letter is;--egotistical, vain, foolish; no, not\nfoolish--narrow, limited, but not foolish; worldly, oh, how worldly! and\nyet not repulsively so, for there always was in her a certain intensity of\nfeeling that saved her from the commonplace, and gave her an inexpressible\ncharm. Yes, she is a woman who can feel, and she has lived her life and\nfelt it very acutely, very sincerely--sincerely?... like a moth caught in a\ngauze curtain! Well, would that preclude sincerity? Sincerity seems to\nconvey an idea of depth, and she was not very deep, that is quite certain.\nI never could understand her;--a little brain that span rapidly and hummed\na pretty humming tune. But no, there was something more in her than that.\nShe often said things that I thought clever, things that I did not forget,\nthings, that I should like to put into books. But it was not brain power;\nit was only intensity of feeling--nervous feeling. I don't know ...\nperhaps.... She has lived her life ... yes, within certain limits she has\nlived her life. None of us do more than that. True. I remember the first\ntime I saw her. Sharp, little, and merry--a changeable little sprite. I\nthought she had ugly hands; so she has, and yet I forgot all about her\nhands before I had known her a month. It is now seven years ago. How time\npasses! I was very young then. What battles we have had, what quarrels!\nStill we had good times together. She never lost sight of me, but no\nintrusion; far too clever for that. I never got the better of her but once\n... once I did, _enfin_! She soon made up for lost ground. I wonder\nwhat the charm was. I did not think her pretty, I did not think her clever;\nthat I know.... I never knew if she cared for me, never. There were moments\nwhen.... Curious, febrile, subtle little creature, oh, infinitely subtle,\nsubtle in everything, in her sensations subtle; I suppose that was her\ncharm, subtleness. I never knew if she cared for me, I never knew if she\nhated her husband,--one never knew her,--I never knew how she would receive\nme. The last time I saw her ... that stupid American would take her\ndownstairs, no getting rid of him, and I was hiding behind one of the\npillars in the Rue de Rivoli, my hand on the cab door. However, she could\nnot blame me that time--and all the stories she used to invent of my\nindiscretions; I believe she used to get them up for the sake of the\nexcitement. She was awfully silly in some ways, once you got her into a\ncertain line; that marriage, that title, and she used to think of it night\nand day. I shall never forget when she went into mourning for the Count de\nChambord. And her tastes, oh, how bourgeois they were! That salon; the\nflagrantly modern clock, brass work, eight hundred francs on the Boulevard\nSt. Germain, the cabinets, brass work, the rich brown carpet, and the\nfurniture set all round the room geometrically, the great gilt mirror, the\nancestral portrait, the arms and crest everywhere, and the stuffy bourgeois\nsense of comfort; a little grotesque no doubt;--the mechanical admiration\nfor all that is about her, for the general atmosphere, the _Figaro_,\nthat is to say Albert Wolf, _l'homme le plus spirituel de Paris,\nc'est-\u00c3\u00a0-dire, dans le monde_, the success of Georges Ohnet and the\ntalent of Gustave Dor\u00c3\u00a9. But with all this vulgarity of taste certain\nappreciations, certain ebullitions of sentiment, within the radius of\nsentiment certain elevations and depravities,--depravities in the\nlegitimate sense of the word, that is to say, a revolt against the\ncommonplace....\n\n\nHa, ha, ha! how I have been dreaming. I wish I had not been awoke from my\nreverie, it was pleasant.\n\nThe letter just read indicates, if it does not clearly tell, the changes\nthat have taken place in my life; and it is only necessary to say that one\nmorning, a few months ago, when my servant brought me some summer honey and\na glass of milk to my bedside, she handed me an unpleasant letter. My\nagent's handwriting, even when I knew the envelope contained a cheque, has\nnever quite failed to produce a sensation of repugnance in me;--so hateful\nis any sort of account, that I avoid as much as possible even knowing how I\nstand at my banker's. Therefore the odour of honey and milk, so evocative\nof fresh flowers and fields, was spoilt that morning for me; and it was\nsome time before I slipped on that beautiful Japanese dressing-gown, which\nI shall never see again, and read the odious epistle.\n\nThat some wretched farmers and miners should refuse to starve, that I may\nnot be deprived of my _demi-tasse_ at _Tortoni's_; that I may not\nbe forced to leave this beautiful retreat, my cat and my python--monstrous.\nAnd these wretched creatures will find moral support in England; they will\nfind pity!\n\nPity, that most vile of all vile virtues, has never been known to me. The\ngreat pagan world I love knew it not. Now the world proposes to interrupt\nthe terrible austere laws of nature which ordain that the weak shall be\ntrampled upon, shall be ground into death and dust, that the strong shall\nbe really strong,--that the strong shall be glorious, sublime. A little\nbourgeois comfort, a little bourgeois sense of right, cry the moderns.\n\nHither the world has been drifting since the coming of the pale socialist\nof Galilee; and this is why I hate Him, and deny His divinity. His divinity\nis falling, it is evanescent in sight of the goal He dreamed; again He is\ndenied by His disciples. Poor fallen God! I, who hold nought else pitiful,\npity Thee, Thy bleeding face and hands and feet, Thy hanging body; Thou at\nleast art picturesque, and in a way beautiful in the midst of the sombre\nmediocrity, towards which Thou hast drifted for two thousand years, a flag;\nand in which Thou shalt find Thy doom as I mine, I, who will not adore Thee\nand cannot curse Thee now. For verily Thy life and Thy fate has been\ngreater, stranger and more Divine than any man's has been. The chosen\npeople, the garden, the betrayal, the crucifixion, and the beautiful story,\nnot of Mary, but of Magdalen. The God descending to the harlot! Even the\ngreat pagan world of marble and pomp and lust and cruelty, that my soul\ngoes out to and hails as the grandest, has not so sublime a contrast to\nshow us as this.\n\nCome to me, ye who are weak. The Word went forth, the terrible disastrous\nWord, and before it fell the ancient gods, and the vices that they\nrepresent, and which I revere, are outcast now in the world of men; the\nWord went forth, and the world interpreted the Word, blindly, ignorantly,\nsavagely, for two thousand years, but nevertheless nearing every day the\nend--the end that Thou in Thy divine intelligence foresaw, that finds its\nvoice to-day (enormous though the antithesis may be, I will say it) in the\n_Pall Mall Gazette_. What fate has been like Thine? Betrayed by Judas\nin the garden, denied by Peter before the cock crew, crucified between\nthieves, and mourned for by a harlot, and then sent bound and bare, nothing\nchanged, nothing altered, in Thy ignominious plight, forthward in the\nworld's van the glory and symbol of a man's new idea--Pity. Thy day is\nclosing in, but the heavens are now wider aflame with Thy light than ever\nbefore--Thy light, which I, a pagan, standing on the last verge of the old\nworld, declare to be darkness, the coming night of pity and justice which\nis imminent, which is the twentieth century. The bearers have relinquished\nThy cross, they leave Thee in the hour of Thy universal triumph, Thy crown\nof thorns is falling, Thy face is buffeted with blows, and not even a reed\nis placed in Thy hand for sceptre; only I and mine are by Thee, we who\nshall perish with Thee, in the ruin Thou hast created.\n\nInjustice we worship; all that lifts us out of the miseries of life is the\nsublime fruit of injustice. Every immortal deed was an act of fearful\ninjustice; the world of grandeur, of triumph, of courage, of lofty\naspiration, was built up on injustice. Man would not be man but for\ninjustice. Hail, therefore, to the thrice glorious virtue injustice! What\ncare I that some millions of wretched Israelites died under Pharaoh's lash\nor Egypt's sun? It was well that they died that I might have the pyramids\nto look on, or to fill a musing hour with wonderment. Is there one amongst\nus who would exchange them for the lives of the ignominious slaves that\ndied? What care I that the virtue of some sixteen-year-old maiden was the\nprice paid for Ingres' _La Source_? That the model died of drink and\ndisease in the hospital, is nothing when compared with the essential that I\nshould have _La Source_, that exquisite dream of innocence, to think\nof till my soul is sick with delight of the painter's holy vision. Nay\nmore, the knowledge that a wrong was done--that millions of Israelites died\nin torments, that a girl, or a thousand girls, died in the hospital for\nthat one virginal thing, is an added pleasure which I could not afford to\nspare. Oh, for the silence of marble courts, for the shadow of great\npillars, for gold, for reticulated canopies of lilies; to see the great\ngladiators pass, to hear them cry the famous \"Ave Caesar,\" to hold the\nthumb down, to see the blood flow, to fill the languid hours with the\nagonies of poisoned slaves! Oh, for excess, for crime! I would give many\nlives to save one sonnet by Baudelaire; for the hymn, \"_A la tr\u00c3\u00a8s-ch\u00c3\u00a8re,\n\u00c3\u00a0 la tr\u00c3\u00a8s-belle, qui remplit mon coeur de clart\u00c3\u00a9_,\" let the first-born\nin every house in Europe be slain; and in all sincerity I profess my\nreadiness to decapitate all the Japanese in Japan and elsewhere, to save\nfrom destruction one drawing by Hokee. Again I say that all we deem sublime\nin the world's history are acts, of injustice; and it is certain that if\nmankind does not relinquish at once, and for ever, its vain, mad, and fatal\ndream of justice, the world will lapse into barbarism. England was great\nand glorious, because England was unjust, and England's greatest son was\nthe personification of injustice--Cromwell.\n\nBut the old world of heroes is over now. The skies above us are dark with\nsentimentalism, the sand beneath us is shoaling fast, we are running with\nstreaming canvas upon ruin; all ideals have gone; nothing remains to us for\nworship but the Mass, the blind, inchoate, insatiate Mass; fog and fen land\nbefore us, we shall founder in putrefying mud, creatures of the ooze and\nrushes about us--we, the great ship that has floated up from the antique\nworld. Oh, for the antique world, its plain passion, its plain joys in the\nsea, where the Triton blew a plaintive blast, and the forest where the\nwhiteness of the nymph was seen escaping! We are weary of pity, we are\nweary of being good; we are weary of tears and effusion, and our\nrefuge--the British Museum--is the wide sea shore and the wind of the\nocean. There, there is real joy in the flesh; our statues are naked, but we\nare ashamed, and our nakedness is indecency: a fair, frank soul is mirrored\nin those fauns and nymphs; and how strangely enigmatic is the soul of the\nantique world, the bare, barbarous soul of beauty and of might!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nBut neither Apollo nor Buddha could help or save me. One in his exquisite\nbalance of body, a skylark-like song of eternal beauty, stood lightly\nadvancing; the other sat sombrously contemplating, calm as a beautiful\nevening. I looked for sorrow in the eyes of the pastel--the beautiful\npastel that seemed to fill with a real presence the rich autumnal leaves\nwhere the jays darted and screamed. The twisted columns of the bed rose,\nburdened with great weight of fringes and curtains, the python devoured a\nguinea pig, the last I gave him; the great white cat came to me. I said all\nthis must go, must henceforth be to me an abandoned dream, a something, not\nmore real than a summer meditation. So be it, and, as was characteristic of\nme, I broke with Paris suddenly, without warning anyone. I knew in my heart\nof hearts that I should never return, but no word was spoken, and I\ncontinued a pleasant delusion with myself; I told my _concierge_ that\nI would return in a month, and I left all to be sold, brutally sold by\nauction, as the letter I read in the last chapter charmingly and touchingly\ndescribes.\n\nNot even to Marshall did I confide my foreboding that Paris would pass out\nof my life, that it would henceforth be with me a beautiful memory, but\nnever more a practical delight. He and I were no longer living together; we\nhad parted a second time, but this time without bitterness of any kind; he\nhad learnt to feel that I wanted to live alone, and had moved away into the\nLatin quarter, whither I made occasional expeditions. I accompanied him\nonce to the old haunts, but various terms of penal servitude had scattered\nour friends, and I could not interest myself in the new. Nor did Marshall\nhimself interest me as he had once done. To my eager taste, he had grown\njust a little trite. My affection for him was as deep and sincere as ever;\nwere I to meet him now I would grasp his hand and hail him with firm, loyal\nfriendship; but I had made friends in the Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes who interested\nme passionately, and my thoughts were absorbed by and set on new ideals,\nwhich Marshall had failed to find sympathy for, or even to understand. I\nhad introduced him to Degas and Manet, but he had spoken of Jules Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre\nand Bouguereau, and generally shown himself incapable of any higher\neducation; he could not enter where I had entered, and this was alienation.\nWe could no longer even talk of the same people; when I spoke of a certain\n_marquise_, he answered with an indifferent \"Do you really think so?\"\nand proceeded to drag me away from my glitter of satin to the dinginess of\nprint dresses. It was more than alienation, it was almost separation; but\nhe was still my friend, he was the man, and he always will be, to whom my\nyouth, with all its aspirations, was most closely united. So I turned to\nsay good-bye to him and to my past life. Rap--rap--rap!\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"I--Dayne.\"\n\n\"I've got a model.\"\n\n\"Never mind your model. Open the door. How are you? what are you painting?\"\n\n\"This; what do you think of it?\"\n\n\"It is prettily composed. I think it will come out all right. I am going to\nEngland; come to say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Going to England! What will you do in England?\"\n\n\"I have to go about money matters; very tiresome. I had really begun to\nforget there was such a place.\"\n\n\"But you are not going to stay there?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"You will be just in time to see the Academy.\"\n\nThe conversation turned on art, and we \u00c3\u00a6stheticised for an hour. At last\nMarshall said, \"I am really sorry, old chap, but I must send you away;\nthere's that model.\"\n\nThe girl sat waiting, her pale hair hanging down her back, a very picture\nof discontent.\n\n\"Send her away.\"\n\n\"I asked her to come out to dinner.\"\n\n\"D----n her ... Well, never mind, I must spend this last evening with you;\nyou shall both dine with me. _Je quitte Paris demain matin, peut-\u00c3\u00aatre\npour longtemps; je voudrais passer ma derni\u00c3\u00a8re soir\u00c3\u00a9e avec mon ami; alors\nsi vous voulez bien me permettre, mademoiselle, je vous invite tous les\ndeux \u00c3\u00a0 diner; nous passerons la soir\u00c3\u00a9e ensemble si cela vous est\nagr\u00c3\u00a9able?_\"\n\n\"_Je veux bien, monsieur._\"\n\nPoor Marie! Marshall and I were absorbed in each other and art. It was\nalways so. We dined in a gargotte, and afterwards we went to a students'\nhall; and it seems like yesterday. I can see the moon sailing through a\nclear sky, and on the pavement's edge Marshall's beautiful, slim, manly\nfigure, and Marie's exquisite gracefulness. She was Lef\u00c3\u00a8vre's Chloe; so\nevery one sees her now. Her end was a tragic one. She invited her friends\nto dinner, and with the few pence that remained she bought some boxes of\nmatches, boiled them, and drank the water. No one knew why; some said it\nwas love.\n\nI went to London in an exuberant necktie, a tiny hat; I wore large trousers\nand a Capoul beard; and I looked, I believe, as unlike an Englishman as a\ndrawing by Gr\u00c3\u00a9vin. In the smoking-room of Morley's Hotel I met my agent, an\nimmense nose, and a wisp of hair drawn over a bald skull. He explained,\nafter some hesitation, that I owed him a few thousands, and that the\naccounts were in his portmanteau. I suggested taking them to a solicitor to\nhave them examined. The solicitor advised me strongly to contest them. I\ndid not take the advice, but raised some money instead, and so the matter\nended so far as the immediate future was concerned. The years the most\nimpressionable, from twenty to thirty, when the senses and the mind are the\nwidest awake, I, the most impressionable of human beings, had spent in\nFrance, not among English residents, but among that which is the\nquintessence of the nation; I, not an indifferent spectator, but an\nenthusiast, striving heart and soul to identify himself with his\nenvironment, to shake himself free from race and language and to recreate\nhimself as it were in the womb of a new nationality, assuming its ideals,\nits morals, and its modes of thought, and I had succeeded strangely well,\nand when I returned home England was a new country to me; I had, as it\nwere, forgotten everything. Every aspect of street and suburban garden was\nnew to me; of the manner of life of Londoners I knew nothing. This sounds\nincredible, but it is so; I saw, but I could realise nothing. I went into a\ndrawing-room, but everything seemed far away--a dream, a presentment,\nnothing more; I was in touch with nothing; of the thoughts and feelings of\nthose I met I could understand nothing, nor could I sympathise with them:\nan Englishman was at that time as much out of my mental reach as an\nEsquimaux would be now. Women were nearer to me than men, and I will take\nthis opportunity to note my observation, for I am not aware that any one\nelse has observed that the difference between the two races is found in the\nmen, not in the women. French and English women are psychologically very\nsimilar; the standpoint from which they, see life is the same, the same\nthoughts interest and amuse them; but the attitude of a Frenchman's mind is\nabsolutely opposed to that of an Englishman; they stand on either side of a\nvast abyss, two animals different in colour, form, and temperament;--two\nideas destined to remain irrevocably separate and distinct. I have heard of\nwriting and speaking two languages equally well: this was impossible to me,\nand I am convinced that if I had remained two more years in France I should\nnever have been able to identify my thoughts with the language I am now\nwriting in, and I should have written it as an alien. As it was I only just\nescaped this detestable fate. And it was in the last two years, when I\nbegan to write French verse and occasional _chroniques_ in the papers,\nthat the great damage was done. I remember very well indeed one day, while\narranging an act of a play I was writing with a friend, finding suddenly to\nmy surprise that I could think more easily and rapidly in French than in\nEnglish; but with all this I did not learn French. I chattered, and I felt\nintensely at home in it; yes, I could write a sonnet or a ballade almost\nwithout a slip, but my prose required a good deal of alteration, for a\ngreater command of language is required to write in prose than in verse. I\nfound this in French and also in English. For when I returned from Paris,\nmy English terribly corrupt with French ideas and forms of thought, I could\nwrite acceptable English verse, but even ordinary newspaper prose was\nbeyond my reach, and an attempt I made to write a novel drifted into a\nmiserable failure; but the following poems opened to me the doors of a\nfirst-class London newspaper, and I was at once entrusted with some\nimportant critical work:\n\n\n\n\n    THE SWEETNESS OF THE PAST\n\n\n    As sailors watch from their prison\n      For the faint grey line of the coasts,\n    I look to the past re-arisen,\n      And joys come over in hosts\n    Like the white sea birds from their roosts.\n\n    I love not the indelicate present,\n      The future's unknown to our quest,\n    To-day is the life of the peasant,\n      But the past is a haven of rest--\n    The things of the past are the best.\n\n    The rose of the past is better\n      Than the rose we ravish to-day,\n    'Tis holier, purer, and fitter\n      To place on the shrine where we pray\n    For the secret thoughts we obey.\n\n    There are there no deceptions or changes,\n      And there all is lovely and still;\n    No grief nor fate that estranges,\n      Nor hope that no life can fulfil,\n    But ethereal shelter from ill.\n\n    The coarser delights of the hour\n      Tempt, and debauch, and deprave,\n    And we joy in a poisonous flower,\n      Knowing that nothing can save\n    Our flesh from the fate of the grave.\n\n    But sooner or later returning\n      In grief to the well-loved nest,\n    Our souls filled with infinite yearning,\n      We cry, in the past there is rest,\n    There is peace, its joys are the best.\n\n\n\n\n    NOSTALGIA\n\n\n    Fair were the dreamful days of old,\n      When in the summer's sleepy shade,\n    Beneath the beeches on the wold,\n      The shepherds lay and gently played\n    Music to maidens, who, afraid,\n      Drew all together rapturously,\n    Their white soft hands like white leaves laid,\n      In the old dear days of Arcady.\n\n    Men were not then as they are now\n      Haunted and terrified by creeds,\n    They sought not then, nor cared to know\n      The end that as a magnet leads,\n    Nor told with austere fingers beads,\n      Nor reasoned with their grief and glee,\n    But rioted in pleasant meads\n      In the old dear days of Arcady.\n\n    The future may be wrong or right,\n      The present is distinctly wrong,\n    For life and love have lost delight,\n      And bitter even is our song;\n    And year by year grey doubt grows strong,\n      And death is all that seems to dree.\n    Wherefore with weary hearts we long\n      For the old dear days of Arcady.\n\n    ENVOI\n\n    Glories and triumphs ne'er shall cease,\n      But men may sound the heavens and sea,\n    One thing is lost for aye--the peace\n      Of the old dear days of Arcady.\n\n\nAnd so it was that I came to settle down in a Strand lodging-house,\ndetermined to devote myself to literature, and to accept the hardships of a\nliterary life. I had been playing long enough, and now I was resolved to\nsee what I could do in the world of work. I was anxious for proof,\nperemptory proof, of my capacity or incapacity. A book! No. I required an\nimmediate answer, and journalism alone could give me that. So I reasoned in\nthe Strand lodging-house. And what led me to that house? Chance, or a\nfriend's recommendation? I forget. It was uncomfortable, hideous, and not\nvery clean: but curious, as all things are curious when examined closely.\nLet me tell you about my rooms. The sitting-room was a good deal longer\nthan it was wide; it was panelled with deal, and the deal was painted a\nlight brown; behind it there was a large bedroom: the floor was covered\nwith a ragged carpet, and a big bed stood in the middle of the floor. But\nnext to the sitting-room was a small bedroom which was let for ten\nshillings a week; and the partition wall was so thin that I could hear\nevery movement the occupant made. This proximity was intolerable, and\neventually I decided on adding ten shillings to my rent, and I became the\npossessor of the entire flat. In the room above me lived a pretty young\nwoman, an actress at the Savoy Theatre. She had a piano, and she used to\nplay and sing in the mornings, and in the afternoon, friends--girls from\nthe theatre--used to come and see her; and Emma, the maid-of-all-work, used\nto take them up their tea; and, oh! the chattering and the laughter. Poor\nMiss L----; she had only two pounds a week to live on, but she was always\nin high spirits except when she could not pay the hire of her piano; and I\nam sure that she now looks back with pleasure and thinks of those days as\nvery happy ones.\n\nShe was a tall girl, a thin figure, and she had large brown eyes; she liked\nyoung men, and she hoped that Mr. Gilbert would give her a line or two in\nhis next opera. Often have I come out on the landing to meet her; we used\nto sit on those stairs talking, long after midnight, of what?--of our\nlandlady, of the theatre, of the most suitable ways of enjoying ourselves\nin life. One night she told me she was married; it was a solemn moment. I\nasked in a sympathetic voice why she was not living with her husband. She\ntold me, but the reason of the separation I have forgotten in the many\nsimilar reasons for separations and partings which have since been confided\nto me. The landlady bitterly resented our intimacy, and I believe Miss\nL---- was charged indirectly for her conversations with me in the bill. On\nthe first floor there was a large sitting-room and bedroom, solitary rooms\nthat were nearly always unlet. The landlady's parlour was on the ground\nfloor, her bedroom was next to it, and further on was the entrance to the\nkitchen stairs, whence ascended Mrs. S----'s brood of children, and Emma,\nthe awful servant, with tea things, many various smells, that of ham and\neggs predominating.\n\nEmma, I remember you--you are not to be forgotten--up at five o'clock every\nmorning, scouring, washing, cooking, dressing those infamous children;\nseventeen hours at least out of the twenty-four at the beck and call of\nlandlady, lodgers, and quarrelling children; seventeen hours at least out\nof the twenty-four drudging in that horrible kitchen, running up stairs\nwith coals and breakfasts and cans of hot water; down on your knees before\na grate, pulling out the cinders with those hands--can I call them hands?\nThe lodgers sometimes threw you a kind word, but never one that recognised\nthat you were akin to us, only the pity that might be extended to a dog.\nAnd I used to ask you all sorts of cruel questions, I was curious to know\nthe depth of animalism you had sunk to, or rather out of which you had\nnever been raised. And you generally answered innocently and na\u00c3\u00afvely\nenough. But sometimes my words were too crude, and they struck through the\nthick hide into the quick, into the human, and you winced a little; but\nthis was rarely, for you were very nearly, oh, very nearly an animal: your\ntemperament and intelligence was just that of a dog that has picked up a\nmaster, not a real master, but a makeshift master who may turn it out at\nany moment. Dickens would sentimentalise or laugh over you; I do neither. I\nmerely recognise you as one of the facts of civilisation. You looked--well,\nto be candid,--you looked neither young nor old; hard work had obliterated\nthe delicate markings of the years, and left you in round numbers something\nover thirty. Your hair was reddish brown, and your face wore that plain\nhonest look that is so essentially English. The rest of you was a mass of\nstuffy clothes, and when you rushed up stairs I saw something that did not\nlook like legs; a horrible rush that was of yours, a sort of cart-horse\nlike bound. I have spoken angrily to you; I have heard others speak angrily\nto you, but never did that sweet face of yours, for it was a sweet\nface--that sweet, natural goodness that is so sublime--lose its expression\nof perfect and unfailing kindness. Words convey little sense of the real\nhorrors of the reality. Life in your case meant this: to be born in a slum,\nand to leave it to work seventeen hours a day in a lodging-house; to be a\nLondoner, but to know only the slum in which you were born and the few\nshops in the Strand at which the landlady dealt. To know nothing of London\nmeant in your case not to know that it was not England; England and London!\nyou could not distinguish between them. Was England an island or a\nmountain? you had no notion. I remember when you heard that Miss L---- was\ngoing to America, you asked me, and the question was sublime: \"Is she going\nto travel all night?\" You had heard people speak of travelling all night,\nand that was all you knew of travel or any place that was not the Strand. I\nasked you if you went to church, and you said \"No, it makes my eyes bad.\" I\nsaid, \"But you don't read; you can't read.\" \"No, but I have to look at the\nbook.\" I asked you if you had heard of God; you hadn't; but when I pressed\nyou on the point you suspected I was laughing at you, and you would not\nanswer, and when I tried you again on the subject I could see that the\nlandlady had been telling you what to say. But you had not understood, and\nyour conscious ignorance, grown conscious within the last couple of days,\nwas even more pitiful than your unconscious ignorance when you answered\nthat you couldn't go to church because it made your eyes bad. It is a\nstrange thing to know nothing; for instance, to live in London and to have\nno notion of the House of Commons, nor indeed of the Queen, except perhaps\nthat she is a rich lady; the police--yes, you knew what a policeman was\nbecause you used to be sent to fetch one to make an organ-man or a Christy\nminstrel move on. To know of nothing but a dark kitchen, grates, eggs and\nbacon, dirty children; to work seventeen hours a day and to get cheated out\nof your wages; to answer, when asked, why you did not get your wages or\nleave if you weren't paid, that you \"didn't know how Mrs. S---- would get\non without me.\"\n\nThis woman owed you forty pounds, I think, so I calculated it from what you\ntold me; and yet you did not like to leave her because you did not know how\nshe would get on without you. Sublime stupidity! At this point your\nintelligence stopped. I remember you once spoke of a half-holiday; I\nquestioned you, and I found your idea of a half-holiday was to take the\nchildren for a walk and buy them some sweets. I told my brother of this and\nhe said--Emma out for a half-holiday! why, you might as well give a mule a\nholiday. The phrase was brutal, but it was admirably descriptive of you.\nYes, you are a mule, there is no sense in you; you are a beast of burden, a\ndrudge too horrible for anything but work; and I suppose, all things\nconsidered, that the fat landlady with a dozen children did well to work\nyou seventeen hours a day, and cheat you out of your miserable wages. You\nhad no friends; you could not have a friend unless it were some forlorn cat\nor dog; but you once spoke to me of your brother, who worked in a potato\nstore, and I was astonished, and I wondered if he were as awful as you.\nPoor Emma! I shall never forget your kind heart and your unfailing good\nhumour; you were born beautifully good as a rose is born with perfect\nperfume; you were as unconscious of your goodness as the rose of its\nperfume. And you were taken by this fat landlady as 'Arry takes a rose and\nsticks it in his tobacco-reeking coat; and you will be thrown away, shut\nout of doors when health fails you, or when, overcome by base usage, you\ntake to drink. There is no hope for you; even if you were treated better\nand paid your wages there would be no hope. That forty pounds even, if they\nwere given to you, would bring you no good fortune. They would bring the\nidle loafer, who scorns you now as something too low for even his kisses,\nhanging about your heels and whispering in your ears. And his whispering\nwould drive you mad, for your kind heart longs for kind words; and then\nwhen he had spent your money and cast you off in despair, the gin shop and\nthe river would do the rest. Providence is very wise after all, and your\nbest destiny is your present one. We cannot add a pain, nor can we take\naway a pain; we may alter, but we cannot subtract nor even alleviate. But\nwhat truisms are these; who believes in philanthropy nowadays?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is you, Emma!\"\n\n\"Are you going to dine at home to-day, sir?\"\n\n\"What can I have?\"\n\n\"Well, yer can 'ave a chop or a steak.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes, yer can 'ave a steak, or a chop, or--\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I know; well then, I'll have a chop. And now tell me, Emma, how is\nyour young man? I hear you have got one, you went out with him the other\nnight.\"\n\n\"Who told yer that?\"\n\n\"Ah, never mind; I hear everything.\"\n\n\"I know, from Miss L----.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me, how did you meet him, who introduced him?\"\n\n\"I met 'im as I was a-coming from the public 'ouse with the beer for\nmissus' dinner.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He asked me if I was engaged; I said no. And he come round down the lane\nthat evening.\"\n\n\"And he took you out?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And where did you go?\"\n\n\"We went for a walk on the Embankment.\"\n\n\"And when is he coming for you again?\"\n\n\"He said he was coming last evening, but he didn't.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he?\"\n\n\"I dunno; I suppose because I haven't time to go out with him. So it was\nMiss L---- that told you; well, you do 'ave chats on the stairs. I suppose\nyou likes talking to 'er.\"\n\n\"I like talking to everybody, Emma; I like talking to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not as you talks to 'er; I 'ears you jes do 'ave fine times. She\nsaid this morning that she had not seen you for this last two nights--that\nyou had forgotten 'er, and I was to tell yer.\"\n\n\"Very well, I'll come out to-night and speak to her.\"\n\n\"And missus is so wild about it, and she daren't say nothing 'cause she\nthinks yer might go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA young man in a house full of women must be almost supernaturally\nunpleasant if he does not occupy a great deal of their attention. Certain\nat least it is that I was the point of interest in that house; and I found\nthere that the practice of virtue is not so disagreeable as many young men\nthink it. The fat landlady hovered round my doors, and I obtained perfectly\nfresh eggs by merely keeping her at her distance; the pretty actress, with\nwhom I used to sympathise with on the stairs at midnight, loved me better,\nand our intimacy was more strange and subtle, because it was pure, and it\nwas not quite unpleasant to know that the awful servant dreamed of me as\nshe might of a star, or something equally unattainable; but the landlady's\ndaughter, a nasty girl of fifteen, annoyed me with her ogling, which was a\nlittle revolting, but the rest was, and I speak quite candidly, not wholly\nunpleasant. It was not aristocratic, it is true, but, I repeat, it was not\nunpleasant, nor do I believe that any young man, however refined, would\nhave found it unpleasant.\n\nBut if I was offered a choice between a chop and steak in the evening, in\nthe morning I had to decide between eggs and bacon and bacon and eggs. A\nknocking at the door, \"Nine o'clock, sir; 'ot water sir; what will you have\nfor breakfast?\" \"What can I have?\" \"Anything you like, sir. You can have\nbacon and eggs, or--\" \"Anything else?\"--Pause.--\"Well, sir, you can have\neggs and bacon, or--\" \"Well, I'll have eggs and bacon.\"\n\nThe streets seemed to me like rat holes, dark and wandering as chance\ndirected, with just an occasional rift of sky, seen as if through an\noccasional crevice, so different from the boulevards widening out into\nbright space with fountains and clouds of green foliage. The modes of life\nwere so essentially opposed. I am thinking now of intellectual rather than\nphysical comforts. I could put up with even lodging-house food, but I found\nit difficult to forego the glitter and artistic enthusiasm of the caf\u00c3\u00a9. The\ntavern, I had heard of the tavern.\n\nSome seventy years ago the Club superseded the Tavern, and since then all\nliterary intercourse has ceased in London. Literary clubs have been\nfounded, and their leather arm-chairs have begotten Mr. Gosse; but the\ntavern gave the world Villon and Marlowe. Nor is this to be wondered at.\nWhat is wanted is enthusiasm and devil-may-careism; and the very aspect of\na tavern is a snort of defiance at the hearth, the leather arm-chairs are\nso many salaams to it. I ask, Did any one ever see a gay club room? Can any\none imagine such a thing? You can't have a club room without mahogany\ntables, you can't have mahogany tables without magazines--_Longmans_,\nwith a serial by Rider Haggard, the _Nineteenth Century_, with an\narticle, \"The Rehabilitation of the Pimp in Modern Society,\" by W.E.\nGladstone--a dulness that's a purge to good spirits, an aperient to\nenthusiasm; in a word, a dulness that's worth a thousand a year. You can't\nhave a club without a waiter in red plush and silver salver in his hand;\nthen you can't bring a lady to a club, and you have to get into a corner to\ntalk about them. Therefore I say a club is dull.\n\nAs the hearth and home grew all-powerful it became impossible for the\nhusband to tell his wife that he was going to the tavern; everyone can go\nto the tavern, and no place in England where everyone can go is considered\nrespectable. This is the genesis of the Club--out of the Housewife by\nRespectability. Nowadays every one is respectable--jockeys, betting-men,\nactors, and even actresses. Mrs. Kendal takes her children to visit a\nduchess, and has naughty chorus girls to tea, and tells them of the joy of\nrespectability. There is only one class left that is not respectable, and\nthat will succumb before long; how the transformation will be effected I\ncan't say, but I know an editor or two who would be glad of an article on\nthe subject.\n\nRespectability!--a suburban villa, a piano in the drawing-room, and going\nhome to dinner. Such things are no doubt very excellent, but they do not\npromote intensity of feeling, fervour of mind; and as art is in itself an\noutcry against the animality of human existence, it would be well that the\nlife of the artist should be a practical protest against the so-called\ndecencies of life; and he can best protest by frequenting a tavern and\ncutting his club. In the past the artist has always been an outcast; it is\nonly latterly he has become domesticated, and judging by results, it is\nclear that if Bohemianism is not a necessity it is at least an adjuvant.\nFor if long locks and general dissoluteness were not an aid and a way to\npure thought, why have they been so long his characteristics? If lovers\nwere not necessary for the development of poet, novelist, and actress, why\nhave they always had lovers--Sappho, George Eliot, George Sand, Rachel,\nSara? Mrs. Kendal nurses children all day and strives to play Rosalind at\nnight. What infatuation, what ridiculous endeavour! To realise the\nbeautiful woodland passion and the idea of the transformation, a woman must\nhave sinned, for only through sin may we learn the charm of innocence. To\nplay Rosalind a woman must have had more than one lover, and if she has\nbeen made to wait in the rain and has been beaten she will have done a\ngreat deal to qualify herself for the part. The ecstatic Sara makes no\npretence to virtue, she introduces her son to an English duchess, and\nthrows over a nation for the love of Richepein, she can, therefore, say as\nnone other--\n\n    \"Ce n'est plus qu'une ardeur dans mes veines cach\u00c3\u00a9e,\n    C'est Venus tout enti\u00c3\u00a8re \u00c3\u00a0 sa proie attach\u00c3\u00a9e.\"\n\nSwinburne, when he dodged about London, a lively young dog, wrote \"Poems\nand Ballads,\" and \"Chastelard,\" since he has gone to live at Putney, he has\ncontributed to the _Nineteenth Century_, and published an interesting\nlittle volume entitled, \"A Century of Rondels,\" in which he continues his\nplaint about his mother the sea.\n\nRespectability is sweeping the picturesque out of life; national costumes\nare disappearing. The kilt is going or gone in the highlands, and the smock\nin the southlands, even the Japanese are becoming Christian and\nrespectable; in another quarter of a century silk hats and pianos will be\nfound in every house in Jeddo. Too true that universal uniformity is the\nfuture of the world; and when Mr. Morris speaks of the democratic art to be\nwhen the world is socialistic, I ask, whence will the unfortunates draw\ntheir inspiration? To-day our plight is pitiable enough--the duke, the\njockey-boy, and the artist are exactly alike; they are dressed by the same\ntailor, they dine at the same clubs, they swear the same oaths, they speak\nequally bad English, they love the same women. Such a state of things is\ndreary enough, but what unimaginable dreariness there will be when there\nare neither rich nor poor, when all have been educated, when self-education\nhas ceased. A terrible world to dream of, worse, far worse, in darkness and\nhopelessness than Dante's lowest circle of hell. The spectre of famine, of\nthe plague, of war, etc., are mild and gracious symbols compared with that\nmenacing figure, Universal Education, with which we are threatened, which\nhas already eunuched the genius of the last five-and-twenty years of the\nnineteenth century, and produced a limitless abortion in that of future\ntime. Education, I tremble before thy dreaded name. The cruelties of Nero,\nof Caligula, what were they?--a few crunched limbs in the amphitheatre; but\nthine, O Education, are the yearning of souls sick of life, of maddening\ndiscontent, of all the fearsome and fathomless sufferings of the mind. When\nGoethe said \"More light,\" he said the wickedest and most infamous words\nthat human lips ever spoke. In old days, when a people became too highly\ncivilised the barbarians came down from the north and regenerated that\nnation with darkness; but now there are no more barbarians, and sooner or\nlater I am convinced that we shall have to end the evil by summary\nedicts--the obstruction no doubt will be severe, the equivalents of\nGladstone and Morley will stop at nothing to defeat the Bill; but it will\nnevertheless be carried by patriotic Conservative and Unionist majorities,\nand it will be written in the Statute Book that not more than one child in\na hundred shall be taught to read, and no more than one in ten thousand\nshall learn the piano.\n\nSuch will be the end of Respectability, but the end is still far distant.\nWe are now in a period of decadence growing steadily more and more acute.\nThe old gods are falling about us, there is little left to raise our hearts\nand minds to, and amid the wreck and ruin of things only a snobbery is left\nto us, thank heaven, deeply graven in the English heart; the snob is now\nthe ark that floats triumphant over the democratic wave; the faith of the\nold world reposes in his breast, and he shall proclaim it when the waters\nhave subsided.\n\nIn the meanwhile Respectability, having destroyed the Tavern, and created\nthe Club, continues to exercise a meretricious and enervating influence on\nliterature. All audacity of thought and expression has been stamped out,\nand the conventionalities are rigorously respected. It has been said a\nthousand times that an art is only a reflection of a certain age; quite so,\nonly certain ages are more interesting than others, and consequently\nproduce better art, just as certain seasons produce better crops. We heard\nin the Nouvelle Ath\u00c3\u00a8nes how the Democratic movement, in other words,\nRespectability, in other words, Education, has extinguished the\nhandicrafts; it was admitted that in the more individual arts--painting and\npoetry--men would be always found to sacrifice their lives for a picture or\na poem: but no man is, after all, so immeasurably superior to the age he\nlives in as to be able to resist it wholly; he must draw sustenance from\nsome quarter, and the contemplation of the past will not suffice. Then the\npressure on him from without is as water upon the diver; and sooner or\nlater he grows fatigued and comes to the surface to breathe; he is as a\nflying-fish pursued by sharks below and cruel birds above; and he neither\ndives as deeply nor flies as high as his freer and stronger ancestry. A\ndaring spirit in the nineteenth century would have been but a timid nursery\nsoul indeed in the sixteenth. We want tumult and war to give us\nforgetfulness, sublime moments of peace to enjoy a kiss in; but we are\nexpected to be home to dinner at seven, and to say and do nothing that\nmight shock the neighbours. Respectability has wound itself about society,\na sort of octopus, and nowhere are you quite free from one of its horrible\nsuckers. The power of the villa residence is supreme: art, science,\npolitics, religion, it has transformed to suit its requirements. The villa\ngoes to the Academy, the villa goes to the theatre, and therefore the art\nof to-day is mildly realistic; not the great realism of idea, but the puny\nreality of materialism; not the deep poetry of a Peter de Hogue, but the\nmeanness of a Frith--not the winged realism of Balzac, but the degrading\nnaturalism of a coloured photograph. To my mind there is no sadder\nspectacle of artistic debauchery than a London theatre; the overfed\ninhabitants of the villa in the stalls hoping for gross excitement to\nassist them through their hesitating digestions; an ignorant mob in the pit\nand gallery forgetting the miseries of life in imbecile stories reeking of\nthe sentimentality of the back stairs. Were other ages as coarse and as\ncommon as ours? It is difficult to imagine Elizabethan audiences as not\nmore intelligent than those that applaud Mr. Pettit's plays. Impossible\nthat an audience that could sit out Edward II. could find any pleasure in\nsuch sinks of literary infamies as _In the Ranks_ and _Harbour\nLights_. Artistic atrophy is benumbing us, we are losing our finer\nfeeling for beauty, the rose is going back to the briar. I will not speak\nof the fine old crusted stories, ever the same, on which every drama is\nbased, nor yet of the musty characters with which they are peopled--the\nmiser in the old castle counting his gold by night, the dishevelled woman\nwhom he keeps for ambiguous reasons confined in a cellar. Let all this be\nwaived. We must not quarrel with the ingredients. The miser and the old\ncastle are as true, and not one jot more true, than the million events\nwhich go to make up the phenomena of human existence. Not at these things\nconsidered separately do I take umbrage, but at the miserable use that is\nmade of them, the vulgarity of the complications evolved from them, and the\npoverty of beauty in the dialogue.\n\nNot the thing itself, but the idea of the thing evokes the idea.\nSchopenhauer was right; we do not want the thing, but the idea of the\nthing. The thing itself is worthless; and the moral writers who embellish\nit with pious ornamentation are just as reprehensible as Zola, who\nembellishes it with erotic arabesques. You want the idea drawn out of\nobscuring matter, this can best be done by the symbol. The symbol, or the\nthing itself, that is the great artistic question. In earlier ages it was\nthe symbol; a name, a plume, sufficed to evoke the idea; now we evoke\nnothing, for we give everything; the imagination of the spectator is no\nlonger called into play. In Shakespeare's days to create wealth in a\ntheatre it was only necessary to write upon a board, \"A magnificent\napartment in a palace.\" This was no doubt primitive and not a little\nbarbarous, but it was better by far than by dint of anxious archaeology to\nconstruct the Doge's palace upon the stage. By one rich pillar, by some\nprojecting balustrade taken in conjunction with a moored gondola, we should\nstrive to evoke the soul of the city of Veronese: by the magical and\nunequalled selection of a subtle and unexpected feature of a thought or\naspect of a landscape, and not by the up-piling of extraneous detail, are\nall great poetic effects achieved.\n\n    \"By the tideless dolorous inland sea,\n    In a land of sand, of ruin, and gold.\"\n\nAnd, better example still,\n\n    \"Dieu que le son du cor est triste au fond des bois,\"\n\nthat impeccable, that only line of real poetry Alfred de Vigny ever wrote;\nand being a great poet Shakespeare consciously or unconsciously observed\nmore faithfully than any other poet these principles of art; and, as is\ncharacteristic of the present day, nowhere do we find these principles so\ngrossly violated as in the representation of his plays. I had painful proof\nof this some few nights after my arrival in London. I had never seen\nShakespeare acted, and I went to the Lyceum and there I saw that exquisite\nlove song--for _Romeo and Juliet_ is no more than a love song in\ndialogue--tricked out in silks and carpets and illuminated building, a\nvulgar bawd suited to the gross passion of an ignorant public. I hated all\nthat with the hatred of a passionate heart, and I longed for a simple\nstage, a few simple indications, and the simple recitation of that story of\nthe sacrifice of the two white souls for the reconciliation of two great\nfamilies. My hatred did not reach to the age of the man who played the\nboy-lover, but to the offensiveness with which he thrust his individuality\nupon me, longing to realize the poet's divine imagination: and the woman,\ntoo, I wished with my whole soul away, subtle and strange though she was,\nand I yearned for her part to be played by a youth as in old time: a youth\ncunningly disguised, would be a symbol; and my mind would be free to\nimagine the divine Juliet of the poet, whereas I could but dream of the\nbright eyes and delicate mien and motion of the woman who had thrust\nherself between me and it.\n\nBut not with symbol and subtle suggestion has the villa to do, but with\nsuch stolid, intellectual fare as corresponds to its material wants. The\nvilla has not time to think, the villa is the working bee. The tavern is\nthe drone. It has no boys to put to school, no neighbours to study, and is\ntherefore a little more refined, or, should I say? depraved, in its taste.\nThe villa in one form or other has always existed, and always will exist so\nlong as our present social system holds together. It is the basis of life,\nand more important than the tavern. Agreed: but that does not say that the\ntavern was not an excellent corrective influence to the villa, and that its\ndisappearance has not had a vulgarising effect on artistic work of all\nkinds, and the club has been proved impotent to replace it, the club being\nno more than the correlative of the villa. Let the reader trace villa\nthrough each modern feature. I will pass on at once to the circulating\nlibrary, at once the symbol and glory of villaism.\n\nThe subject is not unfamiliar to me; I come to it like the son to his\nfather, like the bird to its nest. (Singularly inappropriate comparison,\nbut I am in such excellent humour to-day; humour is everything. It is said\nthat the tiger will sometimes play with the lamb! Let us play.) We have the\nvilla well in our mind. The father who goes to the city in the morning, the\ngrown-up girls waiting to be married, the big drawing-room where they play\nwaltz music, and talk of dancing parties. But waltzes will not entirely\nsuffice, nor even tennis; the girls must read. Mother cannot keep a censor\n(it is as much as she can do to keep a cook, housemaid, and page-boy),\nbesides the expense would be enormous, even if nothing but shilling and\ntwo-shilling novels were purchased. Out of such circumstances the\ncirculating library was hatched.\n\nThe villa made known its want, and art fell on its knees. Pressure was put\non the publishers, and books were published at 31s. 6d.; the dirty, outside\npublic was got rid of, and the villa paid its yearly subscription, and had\nnice large handsome books that none but the _\u00c3\u00a9lite_ could obtain, and\nwith them a sense of being put on a footing of equality with my Lady This\nand Lady That, and certainty that nothing would come into the hands of dear\nKate and Mary and Maggie that they might not read, and all for two guineas\na year. English fiction became pure, and the garlic and assafoetida with\nwhich Byron, Fielding, and Ben Jonson so liberally seasoned their works,\nand in spite of which, as critics say, they were geniuses, have disappeared\nfrom our literature. English fiction became pure, dirty stories were to be\nheard no more, were no longer procurable. But at this point human nature\nintervened; poor human nature! when you pinch it in in one place it bulges\nout in another, after the fashion of a lady's figure. Human nature has from\nthe earliest time shown a liking for dirty stories; dirty stories have\nformed a substantial part of every literature (I employ the words \"dirty\nstories\" in the circulating library sense); therefore a taste for dirty\nstories may be said to be inherent in the human animal. Call it a disease\nif you will--an incurable disease--which, if it is driven inwards, will\nbreak out in an unexpected quarter in a new form and with redoubled\nvirulence. This is exactly what has happened. Actuated by the most laudable\nmotives, Mudie cut off our rations of dirty stories, and for forty years we\nwere apparently the most moral people on the face of the earth. It was\nconfidently asserted that an English woman of sixty would not read what\nwould bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of a maiden of any other\nnation. But humiliation and sorrow were awaiting Mudie. True it is that we\nstill continued to subscribe to his library, true it is that we still\ncontinued to go to church, true it is that we turned our faces away when\n_Mdlle. de Maupin_ or the _Assommoir_ was spoken of; to all\nappearance we were as good and chaste as even Mudie might wish us; and no\ndoubt he looked back upon his forty years of effort with pride; no doubt he\nbeat his manly breast and said, \"I have scorched the evil one out of the\nvilla; the head of the serpent is crushed for evermore;\" but lo, suddenly,\nwith all the horror of an earthquake, the slumbrous law courts awoke, and\nthe burning cinders of fornication and the blinding and suffocating smoke\nof adultery were poured upon and hung over the land. Through the mighty\ncolumns of our newspapers the terrible lava rolled unceasing, and in the\nblack stream the villa, with all its beautiful illusions, tumbled and\ndisappeared.\n\nAn awful and terrifying proof of the futility of human effort, that there\nis neither bad work nor good work to do, nothing but to await the coming of\nthe Nirvana.\n\nI have written much against the circulating library, and I have read a\nfeeble defence or two; but I have not seen the argument that might be\nlegitimately put forward in its favour. It seems to me this: the\ncirculating library is conservatism, art is always conservative; the\ncirculating library lifts the writer out of the precariousness and noise of\nthe wild street of popular fancy into a quiet place where passion is more\nrestrained and there is more reflection. The young and unknown writer is\nplaced at once in a place of comparative security, and he is not forced to\nemploy vile and degrading methods of attracting attention; the known\nwriter, having a certain market for his work, is enabled to think more of\nit and less of the immediate acclamation of the crowd; but all these\npossible advantages are destroyed and rendered _nil_ by the veracious\ncensorship exercised by the librarian.\n\n       *        *        *        *        *\n\nThere is one thing in England that is free, that is spontaneous, that\nreminds me of the blitheness and nationalness of the Continent;--but there\nis nothing French about it, it is wholly and essentially English, and in\nits communal enjoyment and its spontaneity it is a survival of Elizabethan\nEngland--I mean the music-hall; the French music-hall seems to me silly,\neffete, sophisticated, and lacking, not in the popularity, but in the\nvulgarity of an English hall--I will not say the Pavilion, which is too\ncosmopolitan, dreary French comics are heard there--for preference let us\nsay the Royal. I shall not easily forget my first evening there, when I saw\nfor the time a living house--the dissolute paragraphists, the elegant\nmashers (mark the imaginativeness of the slang), the stolid, good-humoured\ncosters, the cheerful lights o' love, the extraordinary comics. What\ndelightful unison of enjoyment, what unanimity of soul, what communality of\nwit; all knew each other, all enjoyed each other's presence; in a word,\nthere was life. Then there were no cascades of real water, nor London\ndocks, nor offensively rich furniture, with hotel lifts down which some one\nwill certainly be thrown, but one scene representing a street; a man comes\non--not, mind you, in a real smock-frock, but in something that suggests\none--and sings of how he came up to London, and was \"cleaned out\" by\nthieves. Simple, you will say; yes, but better than a _fricass\u00c3\u00a9e_ of\n_Faust_, garnished with hags, imps, and blue flame; better, far better\nthan a drawing-room set at the St. James's, with an exhibition of passion\nby Mrs. and Mr. Kendal; better, a million times better than the cheap\npopularity of Wilson Barrett--an elderly man posturing in a low-necked\ndress to some poor slut in the gallery; nor is there in the hall any\naffectation of language, nor that worn-out rhetoric which reminds you of a\nbroken-winded barrel-organ playing _a, che la morte_, bad enough in\nprose, but when set up in blank verse awful and shocking in its more than\nnatural deformity--but bright quips and cracks fresh from the back-yard of\nthe slum where the linen is drying, or the \"pub\" where the unfortunate wife\nhas just received a black eye that will last her a week. That inimitable\nartist, Bessie Bellwood, whose native wit is so curiously accentuated that\nit is sublimated, that it is no longer repellent vulgarity but art, choice\nand rare--see, here she comes with \"What cheer, Rea; Rea's on the job.\" The\nsketch is slight, but is welcome and refreshing after the eternal\ndrawing-room and Mrs. Kendal's cumbrous domesticity; it is curious, quaint,\nperverted, and are not these the _aions_ and the attributes of art?\nNow see that perfect comedian, Arthur Roberts, superior to Irving because\nhe is working with living material; how trim and saucy he is! and how he\nevokes the soul, the brandy-and-soda soul, of the young men, delightful and\nelegant in black and white, who are so vociferously cheering him, \"Will you\nstand me a cab-fare, ducky, I am feeling so awfully queer?\" The soul, the\nspirit, the entity of Piccadilly Circus is in the words, and the scene the\ncomedian's eyes--each look is full of suggestion; it is irritating, it is\nmagnetic, it is symbolic, it is art.\n\nNot art, but a sign, a presentiment of an art, that may grow from the\npresent seeds, that may rise into some stately and unpremeditated\nefflorescence, as the rhapsodist rose to Sophocles, as the miracle play\nrose through Peele and Nash to Marlowe, hence to the wondrous summer of\nShakespeare, to die later on in the mist and yellow and brown of the autumn\nof Crowes and Davenants. I have seen music-hall sketches, comic interludes\nthat in their unexpectedness and na\u00c3\u00afve naturalness remind me of the comic\npassages in Marlowe's _Faustus_, I waited (I admit in vain) for some\nbeautiful phantom to appear, and to hear an enthusiastic worshipper cry out\nin his agony:--\n\n    \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships\n    And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\n    Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.\n    Her lips suck forth my soul; see where it flies!\n    Come, Helen, come; give me my soul again.\n    Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,\n    And all is dross that is not Helena.\"\n\nAnd then the astonishing change of key:--\n\n    \"I will be Paris, and for love of thee,\n    Instead of Troy shall Wurtemberg be sacked,\" etc.\n\nThe hall is at least a protest against the wearisome stories concerning\nwills, misers in old castles, lost heirs, and the woeful solutions of such\nthings--she who has been kept in the castle cellar for twenty years\nrestored to the delights of hair-pins and a mauve dress, the _ing\u00c3\u00a9nue_\nto the protecting arm, etc. The music-hall is a protest against Mrs.\nKendal's marital tendernesses and the abortive platitudes of Messrs. Pettit\nand Sims; the music-hall is a protest against Sardou and the immense\ndrawing-room sets, rich hangings, velvet sofas, etc., so different from the\nmovement of the English comedy with its constant change of scene. The\nmusic-hall is a protest against the villa, the circulating library, the\nclub, and for this the \"'all\" is inexpressibly dear to me.\n\nBut in the interests of those illiterate institutions called theatres it is\nnot permissible for several characters to narrate events in which there is\na sequel, by means of dialogue, in a music-hall. If this vexatious\nrestriction were removed it is possible, if it is not certain, that while\nsome halls remained faithful to comic songs and jugglers others would\ngradually learn to cater for more intellectual and subtle audiences, and\nthat out of obscurity and disorder new dramatic forms, coloured and\npermeated by the thought and feeling of to-day, might be definitely\nevolved. It is our only chance of again possessing a dramatic literature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nIt is said that young men of genius come to London with great poems and\ndramas in their pockets and find every door closed against them.\nChatterton's death perpetuated this legend. But when I, Edward Dayne, came\nto London in search of literary adventure, I found a ready welcome.\nPossibly I should not have been accorded any welcome had I been anything\nbut an ordinary person. Let this be waived. I was as covered with \"fads\" as\na distinguished foreigner with stars. Naturalism I wore round my neck,\nRomanticism was pinned over the heart, Symbolism I carried like a toy\nrevolver in my waistcoat pocket, to be used on an emergency. I do not judge\nwhether I was charlatan or genius, I merely state that I found all--actors,\nmanagers, editors, publishers, docile and ready to listen to me. The world\nmay be wicked, cruel, and stupid, but it is patient; on this point I will\nnot be gainsaid, it is patient; I know what I am talking about; I maintain\nthat the world is patient. If it were not, what would have happened? I\nshould have been murdered by the editors of (I will suppress names), torn\nin pieces by the sub-editors, and devoured by the office boys. There was no\nwild theory which I did not assail them with, there was no strange plan for\nthe instant extermination of the Philistine, which I did not press upon\nthem, and (here I must whisper), with a fair amount of success, not\ncomplete success I am glad to say--that would have meant for the editors a\nchange from their arm-chairs to the benches of the Union and the plank beds\nof Holloway. The actress when she returned home from the theatre, suggested\nI had an enemy, a vindictive enemy, who dogged my steps; but her stage\nexperience led her astray. I had no enemy except myself; or to put it\nscientifically, no enemy except the logical consequences of my past life\nand education, and these caused me a great and real inconvenience. French\nwit was in my brain, French sentiment was in my heart; of the English soul\nI knew nothing, and I could not remember old sympathies, it was like\nseeking forgotten words, and if I were writing a short story, I had to\nreturn in thought to Montmartre or the Champs Elys\u00c3\u00a9es for my characters.\nThat I should have forgotten so much in ten years seems incredible, and it\nwill be deemed impossible by many, but that is because few are aware of how\nlittle they know of the details of life, even of their own, and are\nincapable of appreciating the influence of their past upon their present.\nThe visible world is visible only to a few, the moral world is a closed\nbook to nearly all. I was full of France, and France had to be got rid of,\nor pushed out of sight before I could understand England; I was like a\nsnake striving to slough its skin.\n\nHandicapped as I was with dangerous ideas, and an impossible style, defeat\nwas inevitable. My English was rotten with French idiom; it was like an\nill-built wall overpowered by huge masses of ivy; the weak foundations had\ngiven way beneath the weight of the parasite; and the ideas I sought to\ngive expression to were green, sour, and immature as apples in August.\n\nTherefore before long the leading journal that had printed two poems and\nsome seven or eight critical articles, ceased to send me books for review,\nand I fell back upon obscure society papers. Fortunately it was not\nincumbent on me to live by my pen; so I talked, and watched, and waited\ntill I grew akin to those around me, and my thoughts blended with, and took\nroot in my environment. I wrote a play or two, I translated a French opera,\nwhich had a run of six nights, I dramatized a novel, I wrote short stories,\nand I read a good deal of contemporary fiction.\n\nThe first book that came under my hand was \"A Portrait of a Lady,\" by Henry\nJames. Each scene is developed with complete foresight and certainty of\ntouch. What Mr. James wants to do he does. I will admit that an artist may\nbe great and limited; by one word he may light up an abyss of soul; but\nthere must be this one magical and unique word. Shakespeare gives us the\nword, Balzac, sometimes, after pages of vain striving, gives us the word,\nTourgueneff gives it with miraculous certainty; but Henry James, no; a\nhundred times he flutters about it; his whole book is one long flutter near\nto the one magical and unique word, but the word is not spoken; and for\nwant of the word his characters are never resolved out of the haze of\nnebulae. You are on a bowing acquaintance with them; they pass you in the\nstreet, they stop and speak to you, you know how they are dressed, you\nwatch the colour of their eyes. When I think of \"A Portrait of a Lady,\"\nwith its marvellous crowd of well-dressed people, it comes back to me\nprecisely as an accurate memory of a fashionable soir\u00c3\u00a9e--the staircase with\nits ascending figures, the hostess smiling, the host at a little distance\nwith his back turned; some one calls him. He turns; I can see his white kid\ngloves; the air is as sugar with the odour of the gardenias; there is\nbrilliant light here; there is shadow in the further rooms; the women's\nfeet pass to and fro beneath the stiff skirts; I call for my hat and coat;\nI light a cigar; I stroll up Piccadilly ... a very pleasant evening; I have\nseen a good many people I knew; I have observed an attitude, and an\nearnestness of manner that proved that a heart was beating.\n\nMr. James might say, \"If I have done this, I have done a great deal,\" and I\nwould answer, \"No doubt you are a man of great talent, great cultivation\nand not at all of the common herd; I place you in the very front rank, not\nonly of novelists but of men of letters.\"\n\nI have read nothing of Henry James's that did suggest the manner of a\nscholar; but why should a scholar limit himself to empty and endless\nsentimentalities? I will not taunt him with any of the old taunts--why does\nhe not write complicated stories? Why does he not complete his stories? Let\nall this be waived. I will ask him only why he always avoids decisive\naction? Why does a woman never say \"I will\"? Why does a woman never leave\nthe house with her lover? Why does a man never kill a man? Why does a man\nnever kill himself? Why is nothing ever accomplished? In real life murder,\nadultery, and suicide are of common occurrence; but Mr. James's people live\nin a calm, sad, and very polite twilight of volition. Suicide or adultery\nhas happened before the story begins, suicide or adultery happens some\nyears hence, when the characters have left the stage, but bang in front of\nthe reader nothing happens. The suppression or maintenance of story in a\nnovel is a matter of personal taste; some prefer character-drawing to\nadventures, some adventures to character-drawing; that you cannot have both\nat once I take to be a self-evident proposition; so when Mr. Lang says, \"I\nlike adventures,\" I say, \"Oh, do you?\" as I might to a man who says \"I like\nsherry,\" and no doubt when I say I like character-drawing, Mr. Lang says,\n\"Oh, do you?\" as he might to a man who says, \"I like port.\" But Mr. James\nand I are agreed on essentials, we prefer character-drawing to adventures.\nOne, two, or even three determining actions are not antagonistic to\ncharacter-drawing, the practice of Balzac, and Flaubert, and Thackeray\nprove that. Is Mr. James of the same mind as the poet Verlaine--\n\n    \"La nuance, pas la couleur,\n    Seulement la nuance,\n      .    .    .    .\n    Tout le reste est litt\u00c3\u00a9rature.\"\n\nIn connection with Henry James I had often heard the name of W.D. Howells.\nI bought some three or four of his novels. I found them pretty, very\npretty, but nothing more,--a sort of Ashby Sterry done into very neat\nprose. He is vulgar, is refined as Henry James; he is more domestic; girls\nwith white dresses and virginal looks, languid mammas, mild witticisms,\nhere, there, and everywhere; a couple of young men, one a little cynical,\nthe other a little over-shadowed by his love, a strong, bearded man of\nfifty in the background; in a word, a Tom Robertson comedy faintly spiced\nwith American. Henry James went to France and read Tourgueneff. W.D.\nHowells stayed at home and read Henry James. Henry James's mind is of a\nhigher cast and temper; I have no doubt at one time of his life Henry James\nsaid, I will write the moral history of America, as Tourgueneff wrote the\nmoral history of Russia--he borrowed at first hand, understanding what he\nwas borrowing. W.D. Howells borrowed at second hand, and without\nunderstanding what he was borrowing. Altogether Mr. James's instincts are\nmore scholarly. Although his reserve irritates me, and I often regret his\nconcessions to the prudery of the age,--no, not of the age but of\nlibrarians,--I cannot but feel that his concessions, for I suppose I must\ncall them concessions, are to a certain extent self-imposed, regretfully,\nperhaps ... somewhat in this fashion--\"True, that I live in an age not very\nfavourable to artistic production, but the art of an age is the spirit of\nthat age; if I violate the prejudices of the age I shall miss its spirit,\nand an art that is not redolent of the spirit of its age is an artificial\nflower, perfumeless, or perfumed with the scent of flowers that bloomed\nthree hundred years ago.\" Plausible, ingenious, quite in the spirit of Mr.\nJames's mind; I can almost hear him reason so; nor does the argument\ndisplease me, for it is conceived in a scholarly spirit. Now my conception\nof W.D. Howells is quite different--I see him the happy father of a\nnumerous family; the sun is shining, the girls and boys are playing on the\nlawn, they come trooping in to a high tea, and there is dancing in the\nevening.\n\nMy fat landlady lent me a novel by George Meredith,--\"Tragic Comedians\"; I\nwas glad to receive it, for my admiration of his poetry, with which I was\nslightly acquainted, was very genuine indeed. \"Love in a Valley\" is a\nbeautiful poem, and the \"Nuptials of Attila,\" I read it in the _New\nQuarterly Review_ years ago, is very present in my mind, and it is a\npleasure to recall its chanting rhythm, and lordly and sombre\nrefrain--\"Make the bed for Attila.\" I expected, therefore, one of my old\npassionate delights from his novels. I was disappointed, painfully\ndisappointed. But before I say more concerning Mr. Meredith, I will admit\nat once frankly and fearlessly, that I am not a competent critic, because\nemotionally I do not understand him, and all except an emotional\nunderstanding is worthless in art. I do not make this admission because I\nam intimidated by the weight and height of the critical authority with\nwhich I am overshadowed, but from a certain sense, of which I am as\ndistinctly conscious, viz., that the author is, how shall I put it? the\nFrench would say \"quelqu'un,\" that expresses what I would say in English. I\nremember, too, that although a man may be able to understand anything, that\nthere must be some modes of thoughts and attitudes of mind which we are so\nnaturally antagonistic to, so entirely out of sympathy with, that we are in\nno true sense critics of them. Such are the thoughts that come to me when I\nread Mr. George Meredith. I try to console myself with such reflections,\nand then I break forth, and crying passionately:--jerks, wire splintered\nwood. In Balzac, which I know by heart, in Shakespeare, which I have just\nbegun to love, I find words deeply impregnated with the savour of life; but\nin George Meredith there is nothing but crackjaw sentences, empty and\nunpleasant in the mouth as sterile nuts. I could select hundreds of phrases\nwhich Mr. Meredith would probably call epigrams, and I would defy anyone to\nsay they were wise, graceful or witty. I do not know any book more tedious\nthan \"Tragic Comedians,\" more pretentious, more blatant; it struts and\nscreams, stupid in all its gaud and absurdity as a cockatoo. More than\nfifty pages I could not read.\n\nHow, I asked myself, could the man who wrote the \"Nuptials of Attila\" write\nthis? but my soul returned no answer, and I listened as one in a hollow\nmountain side. My opinion of George Meredith never ceases to puzzle me. He\nis of the north, I am of the south. Carlyle, Mr. Robert Browning, and\nGeorge Meredith are the three essentially northern writers; in them there\nis nothing of Latin sensuality and subtlety.\n\nI took up \"Rhoda Fleming.\" I found some exquisite bits of description in\nit, but I heartily wished them in verse, they were motives for poems; and\nthere was some wit. I remember a passage very racy indeed, of middle-class\nEngland. Antony, I think is the man's name, describes how he is interrupted\nat his tea; a paragraph of seven or ten lines with \"I am having my tea, I\nam at my tea,\" running through it for refrain. Then a description of a\nlodging-house dinner: \"a block of bread on a lonely plate, and potatoes\nthat looked as if they had committed suicide in their own steam.\" A little\nponderous and stilted, but undoubtedly witty. I read on until I came to a\nyoung man who fell from his horse, or had been thrown from his horse, I\nnever knew which, nor did I feel enough interest in the matter to make\nresearch; the young man was put to bed by his mother, and once in bed he\nbegan to talk!... four, five, six, ten pages of talk, and such talk! I can\noffer no opinion why Mr. George Meredith committed them to paper; it is not\nnarrative, it is not witty, nor is it sentimental, nor is it profound. I\nread it once; my mind astonished at receiving no sensation cried out like a\nchild at a milkless breast. I read the pages again ... did I understand?\nYes, I understood every sentence, but they conveyed no idea, they awoke no\nemotion in me; it was like sand, arid and uncomfortable. The story is\nsurprisingly commonplace--the people in it are as lacking in subtlety as\nthose of a Drury Lane melodrama.\n\n\"Diana of the Crossways\" I liked better, and had I had absolutely nothing\nto do I might have read it to the end. I remember a scene with a rustic--a\nrustic who could eat hog a solid hour--that amused me. I remember the\nsloppy road in the Weald, and the vague outlines of the South Downs seen in\nstarlight and mist. But to come to the great question, the test by which\nTime will judge us all--the creation of a human being, of a live thing that\nwe have met with in life before, and meet for the first time in print, and\nwho abides with us ever after. Into what shadow has not Diana floated?\nWhere are the magical glimpses of the soul? Do you remember in \"P\u00c3\u00a8res et\nEnfants,\" when Tourgueneff is unveiling the woman's, shall I say,\naffection, for Bazaroff, or the interest she feels in him? and exposing at\nthe same time the reasons why she will never marry him.... I wish I had the\nbook by me, I have not seen it for ten years.\n\nAfter striving through many pages to put Lucien, whom you would have loved,\nwhom I would have loved, that divine representation of all that is young\nand desirable in man, before the reader, Balzac puts these words in his\nmouth in reply to an impatient question by Vautrin, who asks him what he\nwants, what he is sighing for, \"_D'\u00c3\u00aatre c\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bre et d'\u00c3\u00aatre\naim\u00c3\u00a9_,\"--these are soul-waking words, these are Shakespeare words.\n\nWhere in \"Diana of the Crossways\" do we find soul-evoking words like these?\nWith tiresome repetition we are told that she is beautiful, divine; but I\nsee her not at all, I don't know if she is dark, tall, or fair; with\ntiresome reiteration we are told that she is brilliant, that her\nconversation is like a display of fireworks, that the company is dazzled\nand overcome; but when she speaks the utterances are grotesque, and I say\nthat if any one spoke to me in real life as she does in the novel, I should\nnot doubt for an instant that I was in the company of a lunatic. The\nepigrams are never good, they never come within measurable distance of La\nRochefoucauld, Balzac, or even Goncourt. The admirers of Mr. Meredith\nconstantly deplore their existence, admitting that they destroy all\nillusion of life. \"When we have translated half of Mr. Meredith's\nutterances into possible human speech, then we can enjoy him,\" says the\n_Pall Mall Gazette_. We take our pleasures differently; mine are\nspontaneous, and I know nothing about translating the rank smell of a\nnettle into the fragrance of a rose, and then enjoying it.\n\nMr. Meredith's conception of life is crooked, ill-balanced, and out of\ntune. What remains?--a certain lustiness. You have seen a big man with\nsquare shoulders and a small head, pushing about in a crowd, he shouts and\nworks his arms, he seems to be doing a great deal, in reality he is doing\nnothing; so Mr. Meredith appears to me, and yet I can only think of him as\nan artist; his habit is not slatternly, like those of such literary hodmen\nas Mr. David Christie Murray, Mr. Besant, Mr. Buchanan. There is no trace\nof the crowd about him. I do not question his right of place, I am out of\nsympathy with him, that is all; and I regret that it should be so, for he\nis one whose love of art is pure and untainted with commercialism, and if I\nmay praise it for nought else, I can praise it for this.\n\nI have noticed that if I buy a book because I am advised, or because I\nthink I ought, my reading is sure to prove sterile. _Il faut que cela,\nvient de moi_, as a woman once said to me, speaking of her caprices; a\nquotation, a chance word heard in an unexpected quarter. Mr. Hardy and Mr.\nBlackmore I read because I had heard that they were distinguished\nnovelists; neither touched me, I might just as well have bought a daily\npaper; neither like nor dislike, a shrug of the shoulders--that is all.\nHardy seems to me to bear about the same relation to George Eliot as Jules\nBreton does to Millet--a vulgarisation never offensive, and executed with\nability. The story of an art is always the same,... a succession of\nabortive but ever strengthening efforts, a moment of supreme concentration,\na succession of efforts weakening the final extinction. George Eliot\ngathered up all previous attempts, and created the English peasant; and\nfollowing her peasants there came an endless crowd from Devon, Yorkshire,\nand the Midland Counties, and, as they came, they faded into the palest\nshadows until at last they appeared in red stockings, high heels and were\nlost in the chorus of opera. Mr. Hardy was the first step down. His work is\nwhat dramatic critics would call good, honest, straightforward work. It is\nunillumined by a ray of genius, it is slow and somewhat sodden. It reminds\nme of an excellent family coach--one of the old sort hung on C springs--a\nfat coachman on the box and a footman whose livery was made for his\npredecessor. In criticising Mr. Meredith I was out of sympathy with my\nauthor, ill at ease, angry, puzzled; but with Mr. Hardy I am on quite\ndifferent terms, I am as familiar with him as with the old pair of trousers\nI put on when I sit down to write; I know all about his aims, his methods;\nI know what has been done in that line, and what can be done.\n\nI have heard that Mr. Hardy is country bred, but I should not have\ndiscovered this from his writings. They read to me more like a report, yes,\na report,--a conscientious, well-done report, executed by a thoroughly\nefficient writer sent down by one of the daily papers. Nowhere do I find\nselection, everything is reported, dialogues and descriptions. Take for\ninstance the long evening talk between the farm people when Oak is seeking\nemployment. It is not the absolute and literal transcript from nature after\nthe manner of Henri Monier; for that it is a little too diluted with Mr.\nHardy's brains, the edges are a little sharpened and pointed, I can see\nwhere the author has been at work filing; on the other hand, it is not\nsynthesized--the magical word which reveals the past, and through which we\ndivine the future--is not seized and set triumphantly as it is in \"Silas\nMarner.\" The descriptions do not flow out of and form part of the\nnarrative, but are wedged in, and often awkwardly. We are invited to assist\nat a sheep-shearing scene, or at a harvest supper, because these scenes are\nnot to be found in the works of George Eliot, because the reader is\nsupposed to be interested in such things, because Mr. Hardy is anxious to\nshow how jolly country he is.\n\nCollegians, when they attempt character-drawing, create monstrosities, but\na practised writer should be able to create men and women capable of moving\nthrough a certain series of situations without shocking in any violent way\nthe most generally applicable principles of common sense. I say that a\npractised writer should be able to do this; that they sometimes do not is a\nmatter which I will not now go into, suffice it for my purpose if I admit\nthat Mr. Hardy can do this. In farmer Oak there is nothing to object to;\nthe conception is logical, the execution is trustworthy; he has legs, arms,\nand a heart; but the vital spark that should make him of our flesh and of\nour soul is wanting, it is dead water that the sunlight never touches. The\nheroine is still more dim, she is stuffy, she is like tow; the rich farmer\nis a figure out of any melodrama, Sergeant Troy nearly quickens to life;\nnow and then the clouds are liquescent, but a real ray of light never\nfalls.\n\nThe story-tellers are no doubt right when they insist on the difficulty of\ntelling a story. A sequence of events--it does not matter how simple or how\ncomplicated--working up to a logical close, or, shall I say, a close in\nwhich there is a sense of rhythm and inevitableness is always indicative of\ngenius. Shakespeare affords some magnificent examples, likewise Balzac,\nlikewise George Eliot, likewise Tourgueneff; the \"Oedipus\" is, of course,\nthe crowning and final achievement in the music of sequence and the massy\nharmonies of fate. But in contemporary English fiction I marvel, and I am\nrepeatedly struck by the inability of writers, even of the first-class, to\nmake an organic whole of their stories. Here, I say, the course is clear,\nthe way is obvious, but no sooner do we enter on the last chapters than the\nstory begins to show incipient shiftiness, and soon it doubles back and\nturns, growing with every turn weaker like a hare before the hounds. From a\ncertain directness of construction, from the simple means by which Oak's\nruin is accomplished in the opening chapters, I did not expect that the\nstory would run hare-hearted in its close, but the moment Troy told his\nwife that he never cared for her, I suspected something was wrong; when he\nwent down to bathe and was carried out by the current I knew the game was\nup, and was prepared for anything, even for the final shooting by the rich\nfarmer, and the marriage with Oak, a conclusion which of course does not\ncome within the range of literary criticism.\n\n\"Lorna Doone\" struck me as childishly garrulous, stupidly prolix, swollen\nwith comments not interesting in themselves and leading to nothing. Mr.\nHardy possesses the power of being able to shape events; he can mould them\nto a certain form; that he cannot breathe into them the spirit of life I\nhave already said, but \"Lorna Doone\" reminds me of a third-rate Italian\nopera, _La Fille du R\u00c3\u00a9giment_, or _Ernani_; it is corrupt with\nall the vices of the school, and it does not contain a single passage of\nreal fervour or force to make us forget the inherent defects of the art of\nwhich it is a poor specimen. Wagner made the discovery, not a very\nwonderful one after all when we think, that an opera had much better be\nmelody from end to end. The realistic school following on Wagner's\nfootsteps discovered that a novel had much better be all narrative--an\nuninterrupted flow of narrative. Description is narrative, analysis of\ncharacter is narrative, dialogue is narrative; the form is ceaselessly\nchanging, but the melody of narration is never interrupted.\n\nBut the reading of \"Lorna Doone\" calls to my mind, and very vividly, an\noriginal artistic principle of which English romance writers are either\nstrangely ignorant or neglectful, viz., that the sublimation of the\n_dramatis personae_ and the deeds in which they are involved must\ncorrespond, and their relationship should remain unimpaired. Turner's\n\"Carthage\" is nature transposed and wonderfully modified. Some of the\npassages of light and shade there--those of the balustrade--are fugues, and\nthere his art is allied to Bach in sonority and beautiful combination.\nTurner knew that a branch hung across the sun looked at separately was\nblack, but he painted it light to maintain the equipoise of atmosphere. In\nthe novel the characters are the voice, the deeds are the orchestra. But\nthe English novelist takes 'Arry and 'Arriet, and without question allows\nthem to achieve deeds; nor does he hesitate to pass them into the realms of\nthe supernatural. Such violation of the first principles of narration is\nnever to be met with in the elder writers. Achilles stands as tall as Troy,\nMerlin is as old and as wise as the world. Rhythm and poetical expression\nare essential attributes of dramatic genius, but the original sign of race\nand mission is an instinctive modulation of man with the deeds he attempts\nor achieves. The man and the deed must be cognate and equal, and the\nmelodic balance and blending are what first separate Homer and Hugo from\nthe fabricators of singular adventures. In Scott leather jerkins, swords,\nhorses, mountains, and castles harmonise completely and fully with food,\nfighting, words, and vision of life; the chords are simple as Handel's, but\nthey are as perfect. Lytton's work, although as vulgar as Verdi's is, in\nmuch the same fashion, sustained by a natural sense of formal harmony; but\nall that follows is decadent,--an admixture of romance and realism, the\nexaggerations of Hugo and the homeliness of Trollope; a litter of ancient\nelements in a state of decomposition.\n\nThe spiritual analysis of Balzac equals the triumphant imagination of\nShakespeare, and by different roads they reach the same height of tragic\nawe, but when improbability, which in these days does duty for imagination,\nis mixed with the familiar aspects of life, the result is inchoate and\nrhythmless folly, I mean the regular and inevitable alternation and\ncombination of pa and ma, and dear Annie who lives at Clapham, with the\nMountains of the Moon, and the secret of eternal life; this violation of\nthe first principles of art--that is to say, of the rhythm of feeling and\nproportion, is not possible in France. I ask the reader to recall what was\nsaid on the subject of the Club, Tavern, and Villa. We have a surplus\npopulation of more than two million women, the tradition that chastity is\nwoman's only virtue still survives, the Tavern and its adjunct Bohemianism\nhave been suppressed, and the Villa is omnipotent and omnipresent;\ntennis-playing, church on Sundays, and suburban hops engender a craving for\nexcitement for the far away, for the unknown; but the Villa with its\ntennis-playing, church on Sundays, and suburban hops will not surrender its\nown existence, it must take a part in the heroic deeds that happen in the\nMountains of the Moon; it will have heroism in its own pint pot. Achilles\nand Merlin must be replaced by Uncle Jim and an undergraduate; and so the\nVilla is the author of \"Rider Haggard,\" \"Hugh Conway,\" \"Robert Buchanan,\"\nand the author of \"The House on the Marsh.\"\n\nI read two books by Mr. Christie Murray, \"Joseph's Coat\" and \"Rainbow\nGold,\" and one by Messrs. Besant and Rice,--\"The Seamy Side.\" It is\ndifficult to criticise such work, there is absolutely nothing to say but\nthat it is as suited to the mental needs of the Villa as the baker's loaves\nand the butcher's rounds of beef are to the physical. I do not think that\nany such literature is found in any other country. In France some three or\nfour men produce works of art, the rest of the fiction of the country is\nunknown to men of letters. But \"Rainbow Gold,\" I take the best of the\nthree, is not bad as a second-rate French novel is bad; it is excellent as\nall that is straightforward is excellent; and it is surprising to find that\nwork can be so good, and at the same time so devoid of artistic charm. That\nsuch a thing should be is one of the miracles of the Villa.\n\nI have heard that Mr. Besant is an artist in the \"Chaplain of the Fleet\"\nand other novels, but this is not possible. The artist shows what he is\ngoing to do the moment he puts pen to paper, or brush to canvas; he\nimproves on his first attempts, that is all; and I found \"The Seamy Side\"\nso very common, that I cannot believe for a moment that its author or\nauthors could write a line that would interest me.\n\nMr. Robert Buchanan is a type of artist that every age produces\nunfailingly: Catulle Mend\u00c3\u00a8s is his counterpart in France,--but the pallid\nPortuguese Jew with his Christ-like face, and his fascinating fervour is\nmore interesting than the spectacled Scotchman. Both began with volumes of\nexcellent but characterless verse, and loud outcries about the dignity of\nart, and both have--well ... Mr. Robert Buchanan has collaborated with Gus\nHarris, and written the programme poetry for the Vaudeville Theatre; he has\nwritten a novel, the less said about which the better--he has attacked men\nwhose shoestrings he is not fit to tie, and having failed to injure them,\nhe retracted all he said, and launched forth into slimy benedictions. He\ntook Fielding's masterpiece, degraded it, and debased it; he wrote to the\npapers that Fielding was a genius in spite of his coarseness, thereby\ninferring that he was a much greater genius since he had sojourned in this\nScotch house of literary ill-fame. Clarville, the author of \"Madame Angot,\"\ntransformed Madame Marneff into a virtuous woman; but he did not write to\nthe papers to say that Balzac owed him a debt of gratitude on that account.\n\nThe star of Miss Braddon has finally set in the obscure regions of\nservantgalism; Ouida and Rhoda Broughton continue to rewrite the books they\nwrote ten years ago; Mrs. Lynn Linton I have not read. The \"Story of an\nAfrican Farm\" was pressed upon me. I found it sincere and youthful,\ndisjointed but well-written; descriptions of sand-hills and ostriches\nsandwiched with doubts concerning a future state, and convictions regarding\nthe moral and physical superiority of women: but of art nothing; that is to\nsay, art as I understand it,--rhythmical sequence of events described with\nrhythmical sequence of phrase.\n\nI read the \"Story of Elizabeth\" by Miss Thackeray. It came upon me with all\nthe fresh and fair naturalness of a garden full of lilacs and blue sky, and\nI thought of Hardy, Blackmore, Murray, and Besant as of great warehouses\nwhere everything might be had, and even if the article required were not in\nstock it could be supplied in a few days at latest. The exquisite little\ndescriptions, full of air, colour, lightness, grace; the French life seen\nwith such sweet English eyes; the sweet little descriptions all so gently\nevocative. \"What a tranquil little kitchen it was, with a glimpse of the\ncourtyard outside, and the cocks and hens, and the poplar trees waving in\nthe sunshine, and the old woman sitting in her white cap busy at her homely\nwork.\" Into many wearisome pages these simple lines have since been\nexpanded, without affecting the beauty of the original. \"Will Dampier\nturned his broad back and looked out of the window. There was a moment's\nsilence. They could hear the tinkling of bells, the whistling of the sea,\nthe voices of the men calling to each other in the port, the sunshine\nstreamed in; Elly was standing in it, and seemed gilt with a golden\nbackground. She ought to have held a palm in her hand, poor little martyr!\"\nThere is sweet wisdom in this book, wisdom that is eternal, being simple;\nand near may not come the ugliness of positivism, nor the horror of\npessimism, nor the profound greyness of Hegelism, but merely the genial\nlove and reverence of a beautiful-minded woman.\n\nSuch charms as these necessitate certain defects, I should say limitations.\nVital creation of character is not possible to Miss Thackeray, but I do not\nrail against beautiful water-colour indications of balconies, vases,\ngardens, fields, and harvesters because they have not the fervid glow and\npassionate force of Titian's Ariadne; Miss Thackeray cannot give us a\nMaggie Tulliver, and all the many profound modulations of that\nBeethoven-like countryside: the pine wood and the cripple; this aunt's\nlinen presses, and that one's economies; the boy going forth to conquer the\nworld, the girl remaining at home to conquer herself; the mighty river\nholding the fate of all, playing and dallying with it for a while, and\nbearing it on at last to final and magnificent extinction. That sense of\nthe inevitable which had the Greek dramatists wholly, which had George\nEliot sufficiently, that rhythmical progression of events, rhythm and\ninevitableness (two words for one and the same thing) is not there. Elly's\ngolden head, the back-ground of austere French Protestants, is sketched\nwith a flowing water-colour brush, I do not know if it is true, but true or\nfalse in reality, it is true in art. But the jarring dissonance of her\nmarriage is inadmissible; it cannot be led up to by chords no matter how\ningenious, the passage, the attempts from one key to the other, is\nimpossible; the true end is the ruin, by death or lingering life, of Elly\nand the remorse of the mother.\n\nOne of the few writers of fiction who seems to me to possess an ear for the\nmusic of events is Miss Margaret Veley. Her first novel, \"For Percival,\"\nalthough diffuse, although it occasionally flowed into by-channels and\nlingered in stagnating pools, was informed and held together, even at ends\nthe most twisted and broken, by that sense of rhythmic progression which is\nso dear to me, and which was afterwards so splendidly developed in\n\"Damocles.\" Pale, painted with grey and opaline tints of morning passes the\ngrand figure of Rachel Conway, a victim chosen for her beauty, and crowned\nwith flowers of sacrifice. She has not forgotten the face of the maniac,\nand it comes back to her in its awful lines and lights when she finds\nherself rich and loved by the man whom she loves. The catastrophe is a\ndouble one. Now she knows she is accursed, and that her duty is to trample\nout her love. Unborn generations cry to her. The wrath and the lamentation\nof the chorus of the Greek singer, the intoning voices of the next-of-kin,\nthe pathetic responses of voices far in the depths of ante-natal night,\nthese the modern novelist, playing on an inferior instrument, may suggest,\nbut cannot give: but here the suggestion is so perfect that we cease to\nyearn for the real music, as, reading from a score, we are satisfied with\nthe flute and bassoons that play so faultlessly in soundless dots.\n\nThere is neither hesitation nor doubt. Rachel Conway puts her dreams away,\nshe will henceforth walk in a sad and shady path; her interests are centred\nin the child of the man she loves, and as she looks for a last time on the\ncloud of trees, glorious and waving green in the sunset that encircles her\nhome, her sorrow swells once again to passion, and, we know, for the last\ntime.\n\nThe mechanical construction of M. Scribe I had learnt from M. Duval; the\nnaturalistic school had taught me to scorn tricks, and to rely on the\naction of the sentiments rather than on extraneous aid for the bringing\nabout of a _d\u00c3\u00a9nouement_; and I thought of all this as I read\n\"Disenchantment\" by Miss Mabel Robinson, and it occurred to me that my\nknowledge would prove valuable when my turn came to write a novel, for the\n_mise en place_, the setting forth of this story, seemed to me so\nloose, that much of its strength had dribbled away before it had rightly\nbegun. But the figure of the Irish politician I accept without reserve. It\nseems to me grand and mighty in its sorrowfulness. The tall, dark-eyed,\nbeautiful Celt, attainted in blood and brain by generations of famine and\ndrink, alternating with the fervid sensuousness of the girl, her Saxon\nsense of right alternating with the Celt's hereditary sense of revenge, his\ndreamy patriotism, his facile platitudes, his acceptance of literature as a\nsort of bread basket, his knowledge that he is not great nor strong, and\ncan do nothing in the world but love his country; and as he passes his\nthirtieth year the waxing strong of the disease, nervous disease complex\nand torturous; to him drink is at once life and death; an article is bread,\nand to calm him and collect what remains of weak, scattered thought, he\nmust drink. The woman cannot understand that caste and race separate them;\nand the damp air of spent desire, and the grey and falling leaves of her\nillusions fill her life's sky. Nor is there any hope for her until the\nhusband unties the awful knot by suicide.\n\nI will state frankly that Mr. R.L. Stevenson never wrote a line that failed\nto delight me; but he never wrote a book. You arrive at a strangely just\nestimate of a writer's worth by the mere question: \"What is he the author\nof?\" for every writer whose work is destined to live is the author of one\nbook that outshines the other, and, in popular imagination, epitomises his\ntalent and position. What is Shakespeare the author of? What is Milton the\nauthor of? What is Fielding the author of? What is Byron the author of?\nWhat is Carlyle the author of? What is Thackeray the author of? What is\nZola the author of? What is Mr. Swinburne the author of? Mr. Stevenson is\nthe author of shall I say, \"Treasure Island,\" or what?\n\nI think of Mr. Stevenson as a consumptive youth weaving garlands of sad\nflowers with pale, weak hands, or leaning to a large plate-glass window,\nand scratching thereon exquisite profiles with a diamond pencil.\n\nI do not care to speak of great ideas, for I am unable to see how an idea\ncan exist, at all events can be great out of language; an allusion to Mr.\nStevenson's verbal expression will perhaps make my meaning clear. His\nperiods are fresh and bright, rhythmical in sound, and perfect realizations\nof their sense; in reading you often think that never before was such\ndefiniteness united to such poetry of expression; every page and every\nsentence rings of its individuality. Mr. Stevenson's style is over smart,\nwell-dressed, shall I say, like a young man walking in the Burlington\nArcade? Yes, I will say so, but, I will add, the most gentlemanly young man\nthat ever walked in the Burlington. Mr. Stevenson is competent to\nunderstand any thought that might be presented to him, but if he were to\nuse it, it would instantly become neat, sharp, ornamental, light, and\ngraceful; and it would lose all its original richness and harmony. It is\nnot Mr. Stevenson's brain that prevents him from being a thinker, but his\nstyle.\n\nAnother thing that strikes me in thinking of Stevenson (I pass over his\ndirect indebtedness to Edgar Poe, and his constant appropriation of his\nmethods), is the unsuitableness of the special characteristics of his\ntalent to the age he lives in. He wastes in his limitations, and his talent\nis vented in prettinesses of style. In speaking of Mr. Henry James, I said\nthat, although he had conceded much to the foolish, false, and hypocritical\ntaste of the time, the concessions he made had in little or nothing\nimpaired his talent. The very opposite seems to me the case with Mr.\nStevenson. For if any man living in this end of the century needed freedom\nof expression for the distinct development of his genius, that man is R.L.\nStevenson. He who runs may read, and he with any knowledge of literature\nwill, before I have written the words, have imagined Mr. Stevenson writing\nin the age of Elizabeth or Anne.\n\nTurn your platitudes prettily, but write no word that could offend the\nchaste mind of the young girl who has spent her morning reading the Colin\nCampbell divorce case; so says the age we live in. The penny paper that may\nbe bought everywhere, that is allowed to lie on every table, prints seven\nor eight columns of filth, for no reason except that the public likes to\nread filth; the poet and novelist must emasculate and destroy their work\nbecause.... Who shall come forward and make answer? Oh, vile, filthy, and\nhypocritical century, I at least scorn you.\n\nBut this is not a course of literature but the story of the artistic\ndevelopment of me, Edward Dayne; so I will tarry no longer with mere\ncriticism, but go direct to the book to which I owe the last temple in my\nsoul--\"Marius the Epicurean.\" Well I remember when I read the opening\nlines, and how they came upon me sweetly as the flowing breath of a bright\nspring. I knew that I was awakened a fourth time, that a fourth vision of\nlife was to be given to me. Shelley had revealed to me the unimagined skies\nwhere the spirit sings of light and grace; Gautier had shown me how\nextravagantly beautiful is the visible world and how divine is the rage of\nthe flesh; and with Balzac I had descended circle by circle into the nether\nworld of the soul, and watched its afflictions. Then there were minor\nawakenings. Zola had enchanted me with decoration and inebriated me with\ntheory; Flaubert had astonished with the wonderful delicacy and subtlety of\nhis workmanship; Goncourt's brilliant adjectival effects had captivated me\nfor a time, but all these impulses were crumbling into dust, these\naspirations were etiolated, sickly as faces grown old in gaslight.\n\nI had not thought of the simple and unaffected joy of the heart of natural\nthings; the colour of the open air, the many forms of the country, the\nbirds flying,--that one making for the sea; the abandoned boat, the dwarf\nroses and the wild lavender; nor had I thought of the beauty of mildness in\nlife, and how by a certain avoidance of the wilfully passionate, and the\nsurely ugly, we may secure an aspect of temporal life which is abiding and\nsoul-sufficing. A new dawn was in my brain, fresh and fair, full of wide\ntemples and studious hours, and the lurking fragrance of incense; that such\na vision of life was possible I had no suspicion, and it came upon me\nalmost with the same strength, almost as intensely, as that divine song of\nthe flesh,--Mademoiselle de Maupin.\n\nCertainly, in my mind, these books will be always intimately associated;\nand when a few adventitious points of difference be forgotten, it is\ninteresting to note how firm is the alliance, and how cognate and co-equal\nthe sympathies on which it is based; the same glad worship of the visible\nworld, and the same incurable belief that the beauty of material things is\nsufficient for all the needs of life. Mr. Pater can join hands with Gautier\nin saying--_je trouve la terre aussi belle que le ciel, et je pense que\nla correction de la forme est la vertu_. And I too join issue; I too\nlove the great pagan world, its bloodshed, its slaves, its injustice, its\nloathing of all that is feeble.\n\nBut \"Marius the Epicurean\" was more to me than a mere emotional influence,\nprecious and rare though that may be, for this book was the first in\nEnglish prose I had come across that procured for me any genuine pleasure\nin the language itself, in the combination of words for silver or gold\nchime, and unconventional cadence, and for all those lurking half-meanings,\nand that evanescent suggestion, like the odour of dead roses, that words\nretain to the last of other times and elder usage. Until I read \"Marius\"\nthe English language (English prose) was to me what French must be to the\nmajority of English readers. I read for the sense and that was all; the\nlanguage itself seemed to me coarse and plain, and awoke in me neither\naesthetic emotion nor even interest. \"Marius\" was the stepping-stone that\ncarried me across the channel into the genius of my own tongue. The\ntranslation was not too abrupt; I found a constant and careful invocation\nof meaning that was a little aside of the common comprehension, and also a\nsweet depravity of ear for unexpected falls of phrase, and of eye for the\nless observed depths of colours, which although new was a sort of sequel to\nthe education I had chosen, and a continuance of it in foreign, but not\nwholly unfamiliar medium, and having saturated myself with Pater, the\npassage to De Quincey was easy. He, too, was a Latin in manner and in\ntemper of mind; but he was truly English, and through him I passed to the\nstudy of the Elizabethan dramatists, the real literature of my race, and\nwashed myself clean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nTHOUGHTS IN A STRAND LODGING\n\nAwful Emma has undressed and put the last child away--stowed the last child\naway in some mysterious and unapproachable corner that none knows of but\nshe; the fat landlady has ceased to loiter about my door, has ceased to\npester me with offers of brandy and water, tea and toast, the inducements\nthat occur to her landlady's mind; the actress from the Savoy has ceased to\nwalk up and down the street with the young man who accompanied her home\nfrom the theatre; she has ceased to linger on the doorstep talking to him,\nher key has grated in the lock, she has come upstairs, we have had our\nusual midnight conversation on the landing, she has told me her latest\nhopes of obtaining a part, and of the husband whom she was obliged to\nleave; we have bid each other good-night, she has gone up the creaky\nstaircase. I have returned to my room, littered with MS. and queer\npublications; the night is hot and heavy, but now a wind is blowing from\nthe river. I am listless and lonely.... I open a book, the first book that\ncomes to hand ... it is _Le Journal des Goncourts_, p. 358, the end of\na chapter:--\n\n\"_It is really curious that it should be the four men the most free from\nall taint of handicraft and all base commercialism, the four pens the most\nentirely devoted to art, that were arraigned before the public prosecutor:\nBaudelaire, Flaubert, and ourselves._\"\n\nYes it is indeed curious, and I will not spoil the piquancy of the moral by\na comment. No comment would help those to see who have eyes to see, no\ncomment would give sight to the hopelessly blind. Goncourt's statement is\neloquent and suggestive enough; I leave it a naked simple truth; but I\nwould put by its side another naked simple truth. This: If in England the\npublic prosecutor does not seek to override literature, the means of\ntyranny are not wanting, whether they be the tittle-tattle of the nursery\nor the lady's drawing-room, or the shameless combinations entered into by\nlibrarians.... In England as in France those who loved literature the most\npurely, who were the least mercenary in their love, were marked out for\npersecution, and all three were driven into exile. Byron, Shelley, and\nGeorge Moore; and Swinburne, he, too, who loved literature for its own\nsake, was forced, amid cries of indignation and horror, to withdraw his\nbook from the reach of a public that was rooting then amid the garbage of\nthe Yelverton divorce case. I think of these facts and think of\nBaudelaire's prose poem, that poem in which he tells how a dog will run\naway howling if you hold to him a bottle of choice scent, but if you offer\nhim some putrid morsel picked out of some gutter hole, he will sniff round\nit joyfully, and will seek to lick your hand for gratitude. Baudelaire\ncompared that dog to the public. Baudelaire was wrong: that dog was a ----.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I read Balzac's stories of Vautrin and Lucien de Rubempr\u00c3\u00a9, I often\nthink of Hadrian and the Antinous. I wonder if Balzac did dream of\ntransposing the Roman Emperor and his favourite into modern life. It is the\nkind of thing that Balzac would think of. No critic has ever noticed this.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, at night, when all is still, and I look out on that desolate\nriver, I think I shall go mad with grief, with wild regret for my beautiful\n_appartement_ in _Rue de la Tour des Dames_. How different is the\npresent to the past! I hate with my whole soul this London lodging, and all\nthat concerns it--Emma, and eggs and bacon, the fat lascivious landlady and\nher lascivious daughter; I am sick of the sentimental actress who lives\nupstairs, I swear I will never go out to talk to her on the landing again.\nThen there is failure--I can do nothing, nothing; my novel I know is\nworthless; my life is a weak leaf, it will flutter out of sight presently.\nI am sick of everything; I wish I were back in Paris; I am sick of reading;\nI have nothing to read. Flaubert bores me. What nonsense has been talked\nabout him! Impersonal! Nonsense, he is the most personal writer I know.\nThat odious pessimism! How sick I am of it, it never ceases, it is lugged\nin _\u00c3\u00a0 tout dropos_, and the little lyrical phrase with which he winds\nup every paragraph, how boring it is. Happily, I have \"A Rebours\" to read,\nthat prodigious book, that beautiful mosaic. Huysmans is quite right, ideas\nare well enough until you are twenty, afterwards only words are bearable\n... a new idea, what can be more insipid--fit for members of parliament....\nShall I go to bed? No.... I wish I had a volume of Verlaine, or something\nof Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9's to read--Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9 for preference. I remember Huysmans speaks\nof Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9 in \"A Rebours.\" In hours like these a page of Huysmans is as a\ndose of opium, a glass of some exquisite and powerful liqueur.\n\n\"The decadence of a literature irreparably attacked in its organism,\nweakened by the age of ideas, overworn by the excess of syntax, sensible\nonly of the curiosity which fevers sick people, but nevertheless hastening\nto explain everything in its decline, desirous of repairing all the\nomissions of its youth, to bequeath all the most subtle souvenirs of its\nsuffering on its deathbed, is incarnate in Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9 in most consummate and\nabsolute fashion....\n\n\"The poem in prose is the form, above all others, they prefer; handled by\nan alchemist of genius, it should contain in a state of meat the entire\nstrength of the novel, the long analysis and the superfluous description of\nwhich it suppresses ... the adjective placed in such an ingenious and\ndefinite way, that it could not be legally dispossessed of its place, would\nopen up such perspectives, that the reader would dream for whole weeks\ntogether on its meaning at once precise and multiple, affirm the present,\nreconstruct the past, divine the future of the souls of the characters\nrevealed by the light of the unique epithet. The novel thus understood,\nthus condensed into one or two pages, would be a communion of thought\nbetween a magical writer and an ideal reader, a spiritual collaboration by\nconsent between ten superior persons scattered through the universe, a\ndelectation offered to the most refined, and accessible only to them.\"\n\nHuysmans goes to my soul like a gold ornament of Byzantine workmanship;\nthere is in his style the yearning charm of arches, a sense of ritual, the\npassion of the mural, of the window. Ah! in this hour of weariness for one\nof Mallarm\u00c3\u00a9's prose poems! Stay, I remember I have some numbers of _La\nVogue_. One of the numbers contains, I know, \"Forgotten Pages;\" I will\ntranslate word for word, preserving the very rhythm, one or two of these\nminiature marvels of diction:--\n\n\nFORGOTTEN PAGES\n\n\"Since Maria left me to go to another star--which? Orion, Altair, or thou,\ngreen Venus? I have always cherished solitude. What long days I have passed\nalone with my cat. By alone, I mean without a material being, and my cat is\na mystical companion--a spirit. I can, therefore, say that I have passed\nwhole days alone with my cat, and, alone with one of the last authors of\nthe Latin decadence; for since that white creature is no more, strangely\nand singularly I have loved all that the word _fall_ expresses. In\nsuch wise that my favourite season of the year is the last weary days of\nsummer, which immediately precede autumn, and the hour I choose to walk in\nis when the sun rests before disappearing, with rays of yellow copper on\nthe grey walls and red copper on the tiles. In the same way the literature\nthat my soul demands--a sad voluptuousness--is the dying poetry of the last\nmoments of Rome, but before it has breathed at all the rejuvenating\napproach of the barbarians, or has begun to stammer the infantile Latin of\nthe first Christian poetry.\n\n\"I was reading, therefore, one of those dear poems (whose paint has more\ncharm for me than the blush of youth), had plunged one hand into the fur of\nthe pure animal, when a barrel organ sang languidly and melancholy beneath\nmy window. It played in the great alley of poplars, whose leaves appear to\nme yellow, even in the spring-tide, since Maria passed there with the tall\ncandles for the last time. The instrument is the saddest, yes, truly; the\npiano scintillates, the violin opens the torn soul to the light, but the\nbarrel-organ, in the twilight of remembrance, made me dream despairingly.\nNow it murmurs an air joyously vulgar which awakens joy in the heart of the\nsuburbs, an air old-fashioned and commonplace. Why do its flourishes go to\nmy soul, and make me weep like a romantic ballad? I listen, imbibing it\nslowly, and I do not throw a penny out of the window for fear of moving\nfrom my place, and seeing that the instrument is not singing itself.\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"The old Saxony clock, which is slow, and which strikes thirteen amid its\nflowers and gods, to whom did it belong? Thinkest that it came from Saxony\nby the mail coaches of old time?\n\n\"(Singular shadows hang about the worn-out panes.)\n\n\"And thy Venetian mirror, deep as a cold fountain in its banks of gilt\nwork; what is reflected there? Ah! I am sure that more than one woman\nbathed there in her beauty's sin; and, perhaps, if I looked long enough, I\nshould see a naked phantom.\n\n\"Wicked one, thou often sayest wicked things.\n\n\"(I see the spiders' webs above the lofty windows.)\n\n\"Our wardrobe is very old; see how the fire reddens its sad panels! the\nweary curtains are as old, and the tapestry on the arm-chairs stripped of\npaint, and the old engravings, and all these old things. Does it not seem\nto thee that even these blue birds are discoloured by time?\n\n\"(Dream not of the spiders' webs that tremble above the lofty windows.)\n\n\"Thou lovest all that, and that is why I live by thee. When one of my poems\nappeared, didst thou not desire, my sister, whose looks are full of\nyesterdays, the words, the grace of faded things? New objects displease\nthee; thee also do they frighten with their loud boldness, and thou feelest\nas if thou shouldest use them--a difficult thing indeed to do, for thou\nhast no taste for action.\n\n\"Come, close thy old German almanack that thou readest with attention,\nthough it appeared more than a hundred years ago, and the Kings it\nannounces are all dead, and, lying on this antique carpet, my head leaned\nupon thy charitable knees, on the pale robe, oh! calm child, I will speak\nwith thee for hours; there are no fields, and the streets are empty, I will\nspeak to thee of our furniture.\n\n\"Thou art abstracted?\n\n\"(The spiders' webs are shivering above the lofty windows.)\"\n\n\nTo argue about these forgotten pages would be futile. We, the \"ten superior\npersons scattered through the universe\" think these prose poems the\nconcrete essence, the osmazome of literature, the essential oil of art,\nothers, those in the stalls, will judge them to be the aberrations of a\nrefined mind, distorted with hatred of the commonplace; the pit will\nimmediately declare them to be nonsense, and will return with satisfaction\nto the last leading article in the daily paper.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_J'ai fait mes adieux \u00c3\u00a0 ma m\u00c3\u00a8re et je viens pour vous faire les\nmiens_ and other absurdities by Ponson du Terrail amused us many a year\nin France, and in later days similar bad grammar by Georges Ohnet has not\nbeen lost upon us, but neither Ponson du Terrail nor Georges Ohnet sought\nliterary suffrage, such a thing could not be in France, but in England,\nRider Haggard, whose literary atrocities are more atrocious than his\naccounts of slaughter, receives the attention of leading journals and\nwrites about the revival of Romance. As it is as difficult to write the\nworst as the best conceivable sentence, I take this one and place it for\nits greater glory in my less remarkable prose:--\n\n\"_As we gazed on the beauties thus revealed by Good, a spirit of\nemulation filled our breasts, and we set to work to get ourselves up as\nwell as we could._\"\n\nA return to romance! a return to the animal, say I.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne thing that cannot be denied to the realists: a constant and intense\ndesire to write well, to write artistically. When I think of what they have\ndone in the matter of the use of words, of the myriad verbal effects they\nhave discovered, of the thousand forms of composition they have created,\nhow they have remodelled and refashioned the language in their untiring\nstriving for intensity of expression for the very osmazome of art, I am\nlost in ultimate wonder and admiration. What Hugo did for French verse,\nFlaubert, Goncourt, Zola, and Huysmans have done for French prose. No more\nliterary school than the realists has ever existed, and I do not except\neven the Elizabethans. And for this our failures are more interesting than\nthe vulgar successes of our opponents; for when we fall into the sterile\nand distorted, it is through our noble and incurable hatred of the\ncommonplace of all that is popular.\n\nThe healthy school is played out in England; all that could be said has\nbeen said; the successors of Dickens, Thackeray, and George Eliot have no\nideal, and consequently no language; what can be more pudding than the\nlanguage of Mr. Hardy, and he is typical of a dozen other writers, Mr.\nBesant, Mr. Murray, Mr. Crawford? The reason of this heaviness of thought\nand expression is that the avenues are closed, no new subject matter is\nintroduced, the language of English fiction has therefore run stagnant. But\nif the realists should catch favour in England the English tongue may be\nsaved from dissolution, for with the new subjects they would introduce, new\nforms of language would arise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wonder why murder is considered less immoral than fornication in\nliterature?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI feel that it is almost impossible for the same ear to seize music so\nwidely differing as Milton's blank verse and Hugo's alexandrines, and it\nseems to me especially strange that critics varying in degree from Matthew\nArnold to the obscure paragraphist, never seem even remotely to suspect,\nwhen they passionately declare that English blank verse is a more perfect\nand complete poetic instrument than French alexandrines, that the\nimperfections which they aver are inherent in the latter exist only in\ntheir British ears, impervious to a thousand subtleties. Mr. Matthew Arnold\ndoes not hesitate to say that the regular rhyming of the lines is\nmonotonous. To my ear every line is different; there is as much variation\nin Charles V.'s soliloquy as in Hamlet's; but be this as it may, it is not\nunworthy of the inmates of Hanwell for critics to inveigh against _la,\nrime pleine_, that which is instinctive in the language as accent in\nours, that which is the very genius of the language.\n\nBut the principle has been exaggerated, deformed, caricatured until some of\nthe most modern verse is little more than a series of puns--in art as in\nlife the charm lies in the unexpected, and it is annoying to know that the\nonly thought of _every_ poet is to couple _les murs_ with _des\nfruits trop m\u00c3\u00bbrs_, and that no break in the absolute richness of sound\nis to be hoped for. Gustave Kahn whose beautiful volume \"Les Palais\nNomades\" I have read with the keenest delight, was the first to recognise\nthat an unfailing use of _la rime pleine_ might become cloying and\nsatiating, and that, by avoiding it sometimes and markedly and maliciously\nchoosing in preference a simple assonance, new and subtle music might be\nproduced.\n\n\"Les Palais Nomades\" is a really beautiful book, and it is free from all\nthe faults that make an absolute and supreme enjoyment of great poetry an\nimpossibility. For it is in the first place free from those pests and\nparasites of artistic work--ideas. Of all literary qualities the creation\nof ideas is the most fugitive. Think of the fate of an author who puts\nforward a new idea to-morrow in a book, in a play, in a poem. The new idea\nis seized upon, it becomes common property, it is dragged through newspaper\narticles, magazine articles, through books, it is repeated in clubs,\ndrawing-rooms; it is bandied about the corners of streets; in a week it is\nwearisome, in a month it is an abomination. Who has not felt a sickening\nfeeling come over him when he hears such phrases as \"To be or not to be,\nthat is the question\"? Shakespeare was really great when he wrote \"Music to\nhear, why hearest thou music sadly?\" not when he wrote, \"The apparel oft\nproclaims the man.\" Could he be freed from his ideas what a poet we should\nhave! Therefore, let those who have taken firsts at Oxford devote their\nintolerable leisure to preparing an edition from which everything\nresembling an idea shall be firmly excluded. We might then shut up our\nMarlowes and our Beaumonts and resume our reading of the bard, and these\nwitless beings would confer happiness on many, and crown themselves with\ntruly immortal bays. See the fellows! their fingers catch at scanty wisps\nof hair, the lamps are burning, the long pens are poised, and idea after\nidea is hurled out of existence.\n\nGustave Kahn took counsel of the past, and he has successfully avoided\neverything that even a hostile critic might be tempted to term an idea; for\nthis I am grateful to him. Nor is his volume a collection of miscellaneous\nverses bound together. He has chosen a certain sequence of emotions; the\ncircumstances out of which these emotions have sprung are given in a short\nprose note. \"Les Palais Nomades\" is therefore a novel in essence;\ndescription and analysis are eliminated, and only the moments when life\ngrows lyrical with suffering are recorded; recorded in many varying metres\nconforming only to the play of the emotion, for, unlike many who, having\nonce discovered a tune, apply it promiscuously to every subject they treat,\nKahn adapts his melody to the emotion he is giving expression to, with the\nsame propriety and grace as Nature distributes perfume to her flowers. For\nan example of magical transition of tone I turn to _Interm\u00c3\u00a8de_.\n\n    \"Ch\u00c3\u00a8re apparence viens aux couchants illumin\u00c3\u00a9s\n      Veux-tu mieux des matins albes et calmes\n    Les soirs et les matins ont des calmes ros\u00c3\u00a2tres\n    Les eaux ont des manteaux de cristal iris\u00c3\u00a9\n      Et des rythmes de calmes palmes\n    Et l'air \u00c3\u00a9voque de calmes musique de p\u00c3\u00a2tres.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Viens sous des tendelets aux fleuves souriants\n      Aux lilas p\u00c3\u00a2lis des nuits d'Orient\n    Aux glauques \u00c3\u00a9tendues \u00c3\u00a0 falbalas d'argent\n      A l'oasis des baisers urgents\n    Seulement vit le voile aux seuls Orients.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    Quel que soit le spectacle et quelle que soit la rame\n    Et quelle que soit la voix qui s'affame et brame,\n    L'oubli\u00c3\u00a9 du lointain des jours chatouille et serre,\n    Le lotos de l'oubli s'est fan\u00c3\u00a9 dans mes serres,\n\n    Cependant tu m'aimais \u00c3\u00a0 jamais?\n      Adieu pour jamais.\"\n\nThe repetitions of Edgar Poe seem hard and mechanical after this, so\nexquisite and evanescent is the rhythm, and the intonations come as sweetly\nand suddenly as a gust of perfume; it is as the vibration of a fairy\norchestra, flute and violin disappearing in a silver mist; but the clouds\nbreak, and all the enchantment of a spring garden appears in a shaft of\nsudden sunlight.\n\n    \"L'\u00c3\u00a9ph\u00c3\u00a9m\u00c3\u00a8re idole, au frisson du printemps,\n      Sentant des renouveaux \u00c3\u00a9clore,\n    Le gu\u00c3\u00a8pa de satins si lointains et d'antan\n      Rose exil\u00c3\u00a9s des flores!\n\n    \"Le jardin rima ses branches de lilas;\n      Aux murs, les roses tremi\u00c3\u00a8res;\n    La terre \u00c3\u00a9tala, pour f\u00c3\u00aater les las,\n      Des divans vert lumi\u00c3\u00a8re;\n\n    \"Des rires ail\u00c3\u00a9s peupl\u00c3\u00a8rent le jardin;\n      Souriants des caresses br\u00c3\u00a8ves,\n    Des oiseaux joyeux, jaunes, incarnadins\n      Vibr\u00c3\u00a8rent aux ciels de r\u00c3\u00aave.\"\n\nBut to the devil with literature, I am sick of it; who the deuce cares if\nGustave Kahn writes well or badly. Yesterday I met a chappie whose views of\nlife coincide with mine. \"A ripping good dinner,\" he says; \"get a skinful\nof champagne inside you, go to bed when it is light, and get up when you\nare rested.\" This seems to me as concise as it is admirable; indeed there\nis little to add to it ... a note or two concerning women might come in,\nbut I don't know, \"a skinful of champagne\" implies everything.\n\nEach century has its special ideal, the ideal of the nineteenth is a young\nman. The seventeenth century is only woman--see the tapestries, the\ndelightful goddesses who have discarded their hoops and heels to appear in\nstill more delightful nakedness, the noble woods, the tall castles, with\nthe hunters looking round; no servile archaeology chills the fancy, it is\nbut a delightful whim; and this treatment of antiquity is the highest proof\nof the genius of the seventeenth century. See the Fragonards--the ladies in\nhigh-peaked bodices, their little ankles showing amid the snow of the\npetticoats. Up they go; you can almost hear their light false voices into\nthe summer of the leaves, where Loves are garlanded even as of roses. Masks\nand arrows are everywhere, all the machinery of light and gracious days. In\nthe Watteaus the note is more pensive; there is satin and sunset, plausive\ngestures and reluctance--false reluctance; the guitar is tinkling, and\nexquisite are the notes in the languid evening; and there is the Pierrot,\nthat marvellous white animal, sensual and witty and glad, the soul of the\ncentury--ankles and epigrams everywhere, for love was not then sentimental,\nit was false and a little cruel; see the furniture and the polished floor,\nand the tapestries with whose delicate tints and decorations the high hair\nblends, the footstool and the heel and the calf of the leg that is\nwithdrawn, showing in the shadows of the lace; look at the satin of the\nbodices, the fan outspread, the wigs so adorably false, the knee-breeches,\nthe buckles on the shoes, how false; adorable little comedy, adorably\nmendacious; and how sweet it is to feast on these sweet lies, it is a\ndivine delight to us, wearied with the hideous sincerity of newspapers.\nThen it was the man who knelt at the woman's feet, it was the man who\npleaded and the woman who acceded; but in our century the place of the man\nis changed, it is he who holds the fan, it is he who is besought; and if\none were to dream of continuing the tradition of Watteau and Fragonard in\nthe nineteenth century, he would have to take note of and meditate deeply\nand profoundly on this, as he sought to formulate and synthesize the erotic\nspirit of our age.\n\nThe position of a young man in the nineteenth century is the most enviable\nthat has ever fallen to the lot of any human creature. He is the rare bird,\nand is f\u00c3\u00aated, flattered, adored. The sweetest words are addressed to him,\nthe most loving looks are poured upon him. The young man can do no wrong.\nEvery house is open to him, and the best of everything is laid before him;\ngirls dispute the right to serve him; they come to him with cake and wine,\nthey sit circle-wise and listen to him, and when one is fortunate to get\nhim alone she will hang round his neck, she will propose to him, and will\ntake his refusal kindly and without resentment. They will not let him stoop\nto tie up his shoe lace, but will rush and simultaneously claim the right\nto attend on him. To represent in a novel a girl proposing marriage to a\nman would be deemed unnatural, but nothing is more common; there are few\nyoung men who have not received at least a dozen offers, nay, more; it is\ncharacteristic, it has become instinctive for girls to choose, and they\nprefer men not to make love to them; and every young man who knows his\nbusiness avoids making advances, knowing well that it will only put the\ngirl off.\n\nIn a society so constituted, what a delightful opening there is for a young\nman. He would have to waltz perfectly, play tennis fairly, the latest novel\nwould suffice for literary attainments; billiards, shooting, and hunting,\nwould not come in amiss, for he must not be considered a useless being by\nmen; not that women are much influenced by the opinion of men in their\nchoice of favourites, but the reflex action of the heart, although not so\nmarked as that of the stomach, exists and must be kept in view, besides a\nman who would succeed with women, must succeed with men; the real Lovelace\nis loved by all. Like gravitation, love draws all things. Our young man\nwould have to be five feet eleven, or six feet, broad shoulders, light\nbrown hair, deep eyes, soft and suggestive, broad shoulders, a thin neck,\nlong delicate hands, a high instep. His nose should be straight, his face\noval and small, he must be clean about the hips, and his movements must be\nnaturally caressing. He comes into the ball-room, his shoulders well back,\nhe stretches his hand to the hostess, he looks at her earnestly (it is\ncharacteristic of him to think of the hostess first, he is in her house,\nthe house is well-furnished, and is suggestive of excellent meats and\nwines). He can read through the slim woman whose black hair, a-glitter with\ndiamonds, contrasts with her white satin; an old man is talking to her, she\ndances with him, and she refused a young man a moment before. This is a bad\nsign; our Lovelace knows it; there is a stout woman of thirty-five, who is\nlooking at him, red satin bodice, doubtful taste. He looks away; a little\nblonde woman fixes her eyes on him, she looks as innocent as a child;\ninstinctively our Lovelace turns to his host. \"Who is that little blonde\nwoman over there, the right hand corner?\" he asks. \"Ah, that is Lady ----.\"\n\"Will you introduce me?\" \"Certainly.\" Lovelace has made up his mind. Then\nthere is a young oldish girl, richly dressed; \"I hear her people have a\nnice house in a hunting country, I will dance with her, and take the mother\ninto supper, and, if I can get a moment, will have a pleasant talk with the\nfather in the evening.\"\n\nIn manner Lovelace is facile and easy; he never says no, it is always yes,\nask him what you will; but he only does what he has made up his mind it is\nhis advantage to do. Apparently he is an embodiment of all that is\nunselfish, for he knows that after he has helped himself, it is advisable\nto help some one else, and thereby make a friend who, on a future occasion,\nwill be useful to him. Put a violinist into a room filled with violins, and\nhe will try every one. Lovelace will put each woman aside so quietly that\nshe is often only half aware that she has been put aside. Her life is\nbroken; she is content that it should be broken. The real genius for love\nlies not in getting into, but getting out of love.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have noticed that there are times when every second woman likes you. Is\nlove, then, a magnetism which we sometimes possess and exercise\nunconsciously, and sometimes do not possess?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nAnd now, hypocritical reader, I will answer the questions which have been\nagitating you this long while, which you have asked at every stage of this\nlong narrative of a sinful life. Shake not your head, lift not your finger,\nexquisitely hypocritical reader; you can deceive me in nothing. I know the\nbaseness and unworthiness of your soul as I know the baseness and\nunworthiness of my own. This is a magical _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, such a one as\nwill never happen in your life again; therefore I say let us put off all\ncustomary disguise, let us be frank: you have been angrily asking,\nexquisitely hypocritical reader, why you have been _forced_ to read\nthis record of sinful life; in your exquisite hypocrisy, you have said over\nand over again what good purpose can it serve for a man to tell us of his\nunworthiness unless, indeed, it is to show us how he may rise, as if on\nstepping stones of his dead self, to higher things, etc. You sighed, O\nhypocritical friend, and you threw the magazine on the wicker table, where\nsuch things lie, and you murmured something about leaving the world a\nlittle better than you found it, and you went down to dinner and lost\nconsciousness of the world in the animal enjoyment of your stomach. I hold\nout my hand to you, I embrace you, you are my brother, and I say, undeceive\nyourself, you will leave the world no better than you found it. The pig\nthat is being slaughtered as I write this line will leave the world better\nthan it found it, but you will leave only a putrid carcase fit for nothing\nbut the grave. Look back upon your life, examine it, probe it, weigh it,\nphilosophise on it, and then say, if you dare, that it has not been a very\nfutile and foolish affair. Soldier, robber, priest, Atheist, courtesan,\nvirgin, I care not what you are, if you have not brought children into the\nworld to suffer your life has been as vain and as harmless as mine has\nbeen. I hold out my hand to you, we are brothers; but in my heart of hearts\nI think myself a cut above you, because I do not believe in leaving the\nworld better than I found it; and you, exquisitely hypocritical reader,\nthink that you are a cut above me because you say you would leave the world\nbetter than you found it. The one eternal and immutable delight of life is\nto think, for one reason or another, that we are better than our\nneighbours. This is why I wrote this book, and this is why it is affording\nyou so much pleasure, O exquisitely hypocritical reader, my friend, my\nbrother, because it helps you to the belief that you are not so bad after\nall. Now to resume.\n\nThe knell of my thirtieth year has sounded, in three or four years my youth\nwill be as a faint haze on the sea, an illusive recollection; so now while\nstanding on the last verge of the hill, I will look back on the valley I\nlingered in. Do I regret? I neither repent nor do I regret; and a fool and\na weakling I should he if I did. I know the worth and the rarity of more\nthan fifteen years of systematic enjoyment. Nature provided me with as\nperfect a digestive apparatus, mental and physical, as she ever turned out\nof her workshop; my stomach and brain are set in the most perfect equipoise\npossible to conceive, and up and down they went and still go with measured\nmovement, absorbing and assimilating all that is poured into them without\nfriction or stoppage. This book is a record of my mental digestions; but it\nwould take another series of confessions to tell of the dinners I have\neaten, the champagne I have drunk! and the suppers! seven dozen of oysters,\np\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9-de-foie-gras, heaps of truffles, salad, and then a walk home in the\nearly morning, a few philosophical reflections suggested by the appearance\nof a belated street-sweeper, then sleep, quiet and gentle sleep.\n\nI have had the rarest and most delightful friends. Ah, how I have loved my\nfriends; the rarest wits of my generation were my boon companions;\neverything conspired to enable me to gratify my body and my brain; and do\nyou think this would have been so if I had been a good man? If you do you\nare a fool, good intentions and bald greed go to the wall, but subtle\nselfishness with a dash of unscrupulousness pulls more plums out of life's\npie than the seven deadly virtues. If you are a good man you want a bad one\nto convert; if you are a bad man you want a bad one to go out on the spree\nwith. And you, my dear, my exquisite reader, place your hand upon your\nheart, tell the truth, remember this is a magical _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ which\nwill happen never again in your life, admit that you feel just a little\ninterested in my wickedness, admit that if you ever thought you would like\nto know me that it is because I know a good deal that you probably don't;\nadmit that your mouth waters when you think of rich and various pleasures\nthat fell to my share in happy, delightful Paris; admit that if this book\nhad been an account of the pious books I had read, the churches I had been\nto, and the good works I had done, that you would not have bought it or\nborrowed it. Hypocritical reader, think, had you had courage, health, and\nmoney to lead a fast life, would you not have done so? You don't know, no\nmore do I; I have done so, and I regret nothing except that some infernal\nfarmers and miners will not pay me what they owe me and enable me to\ncontinue the life that was once mine, and of which I was so bright an\nornament. How I hate this atrocious Strand lodging-house, how I long for my\napartment in _Rue de la Tour des Dames_, with all its charming\nadjuncts, palms and pastels, my cat, my python, my friends, blond hair and\ndark.\n\nIt was not long before I wearied of journalism; the daily article soon\ngrows monotonous, even when you know it will be printed, and this I did not\nknow; my prose was very faulty, and my ideas were unsettled, I could not go\nto the tap and draw them off, the liquor was still fermenting; and partly\nbecause my articles were not very easily disposed of, and partly because I\nwas weary of writing on different subjects, I turned my attention to short\nstories. I wrote a dozen with a view to preparing myself for a long novel.\nSome were printed in weekly newspapers, others were returned to me from the\nmagazines. But there was a publisher in the neighbourhood of the Strand,\nwho used to frequent a certain bar. I saw the chance, and I seized it. This\nworthy man conducted his business as he dressed himself, sloppily; a dear\nkind soul, quite witless and quite _h_-less. From long habit he would\nmake a feeble attempt to drive a bargain, but he generally let himself in:\nhe was, in a word, a literary stepping-stone. Hundreds had made use of him.\nIf a fashionable author asked two hundred pounds for a book out of which he\nwould be certain to make three, it was ten to one that he would allow the\nchance to drift away from him; but after having refused a dozen times the\nwork of a Strand loafer whom he was in the habit of \"treating,\" he would\nsay, \"Send it in, my boy, send it in, I'll see what can be done with it.\"\nThere was a long counter, and the way to be published by Mr. B. was to\nstraddle on the counter and play with a black cat. There was an Irishman\nbehind this counter who, for three pounds a week, edited the magazine, read\nthe MS., looked after the printer and binder, kept the accounts when he had\na spare moment, and entertained the visitors. I did not trouble Messrs.\nMacmillan and Messrs. Longman with polite requests to look at my MS., but\nstraddled on the counter, played with the cat, joked with the Irishman, was\ntreated by Mr. B., and in the natural order of things my stories went into\nthe magazine, and were paid for. Strange were the ways of this office;\nShakespeare might have sent in prose and poetry, but he would have gone\ninto the wastepaper basket had he not previously straddled. For those who\nwere in the swim this was a matter of congratulation; straddling, we would\ncry, \"We want no blooming outsiders coming along interfering with our\nmagazine. And you, Smith, you devil, you had a twenty-page story in last\nmonth and cut me out. O'Flanagan, do you mind if I send you in a couple of\npoems as well as my regular stuff, that will make it all square?\" \"I'll try\nto manage it; here's the governor.\" And looking exactly like the\nunfortunate Mr. Sedley, Mr. B. used to slouch along, and he would fall into\nhis leather armchair, the one in which he wrote the cheques. The last time\nI saw that chair it was standing in the street, alas! in the hands of the\nbrokers.\n\nBut conservative though we were in matters concerning \"copy,\" though all\nmeans were taken to protect ourselves against interlopers, one who had not\npassed the preliminary stage of straddling would occasionally slip through\nour defences. I remember one especially. It was a hot summer's day, we were\nall on the counter, our legs swinging, when an enormous young man entered.\nHe must have been six feet three in height. He was shown into Mr. B.'s\nroom, he asked him to read a MS., and he fled, looking very frightened.\n\"Wastepaper basket, wastepaper basket,\" we shouted when Mr. B. handed us\nthe roll of paper. \"What an odd-looking fish he is!\" said O'Flanagan; \"I\nwonder what his MS. is like.\" We remonstrated in vain, O'Flanagan took the\nMS. home to read, and returned next morning convinced that he had\ndiscovered an embryo Dickens. The young man was asked to call, his book was\naccepted, and we adjourned to the bar.\n\nA few weeks afterwards this young man took rooms in the house next to me on\nthe ground floor. He was terribly inflated with his success, and was\nclearly determined to take London by storm. He had been to Oxford, and to\nHeidelberg, he drank beer and smoked long pipes, he talked of nothing else.\nSoon, very soon, I grew conscious that he thought me a simpleton; he\npooh-poohed my belief in Naturalism and declined to discuss the symbolist\nquestion. He curled his long legs upon the rickety sofa and spoke of the\nBritish public as the \"B.P.,\" and of the magazine as the \"mag.\" There were\ngenerally tea-things and jam-pots on the table. In a little while he\nbrought a little creature about five feet three to live with him, and when\nthe little creature and the long creature went out together, it was like\nDon Quixote and Sancho Panza setting forth in quest of adventures in the\nland of Strand. The little creature indulged in none of the loud, rasping\naffectation of humour that was so maddening in the long creature; the\nlittle creature was dry, hard, and sterile, and when he did join in the\nconversation it was like an empty nut between the teeth--dusty and bitter.\nHe was supposed to be going in for the law, but the part of him to which he\ndrew our attention was his knowledge of the Elizabethan dramatists. He kept\na pocket-book, in which he held an account of his reading. Holding the\npocket-book between finger and thumb, he would say, \"Last year I read ten\nplays by Nash, twelve by Peele, six by Greene, fifteen by Beaumont and\nFletcher, and eleven anonymous plays,--fifty-four in all.\" He neither\npraised nor blamed, he neither extolled nor criticised; he told you what he\nhad read, and left you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nWhat the little creature thought of the long creature I never discovered,\nbut with every new hour I became freshly sensible that they held me in\nstill decreasing estimation. This, I remember, was wildly irritating to me.\nI knew myself infinitely superior to them; I knew the long creature's novel\nwas worthless; I knew that I had fifty books in me immeasurably better than\nit, and savagely and sullenly I desired to trample upon them, to rub their\nnoses in their feebleness; but oh, it was I who was feeble! and full of\nvisions of a wider world I raged up and down the cold walls of impassable\nmental limitations. Above me there was a barred window, and, but for my\nmanacles, I would have sprung at it and torn it with my teeth. Then passion\nwas so strong in me that I could scarce refrain from jumping off the\ncounter, stamping my feet, and slapping my friends in the face, so tepid\nwere their enthusiasms, so thin did their understanding appear to me. The\nStraddlers seemed inclined for a moment to take the long creature very\nseriously, and in the office which I had marked down for my own I saw him\ninstalled as a genius.\n\nFortunately for my life and my sanity, my interests were, about this time,\nattracted into other ways--ways that led into London life, and were\nsuitable for me to tread. In a restaurant where low-necked dresses and\nevening clothes crushed with loud exclamations, where there was ever an\nodour of cigarette and brandy and soda, I was introduced to a Jew of whom I\nhad heard much, a man who had newspapers and race horses. The bright witty\nglances of his brown eyes at once prejudiced me in his favour, and it was\nnot long before I knew that I had found another friend. His house was what\nwas wanted, for it was so trenchant in character, so different to all I\nknew of, that I was forced to accept it, without likening it to any French\nmemory and thereby weakening the impression. It was a house of champagne,\nlate hours, and evening clothes, of literature and art, of passionate\ndiscussions. So this house was not so alien to me as all else I had seen in\nLondon; and perhaps the cosmopolitanism of this charming Jew, his\nHellenism, in fact, was a sort of plank whereon I might pass and enter\nagain into English life. I found in Curzon Street another \"Nouvelle\nAth\u00c3\u00a8nes,\" a Bohemianism of titles that went back to the Conquest, a\nBohemianism of the ten sovereigns always jingling in the trousers pocket,\nof scrupulous cleanliness, of hansom cabs, of ladies' pet names; of\ntriumphant champagne, of debts, gaslight, supper-parties, morning light,\ncoaching; a fabulous Bohemianism; a Bohemianism of eternal hardupishness\nand eternal squandering of money,---money that rose at no discoverable\nwell-head and flowed into a sea of boudoirs and restaurants, a sort of\nwhirlpool of sovereigns in which we were caught, and sent eddying through\nmusic halls, bright shoulders, tresses of hair, and slang; and I joined in\nthe adorable game of Bohemianism that was played round and about Piccadilly\nCircus, with Curzon Street for a magnificent rallying point.\n\nAfter dinner a general \"clear\" was made in the direction of halls and\ntheatres, a few friends would drop in about twelve, and continue their\ndrinking till three or four; but Saturday night was gala night--at\nhalf-past eleven the lords drove up in their hansoms, then a genius or two\nwould arrive, and supper and singing went merrily until the chimney sweeps\nbegan to go by, and we took chairs and bottles into the street and entered\ninto discussion with the policeman. Twelve hours later we struggled out of\nour beds, and to the sound of church bells we commenced writing. The paper\nappeared on Tuesday. Our host sat in a small room off the dining-room from\nwhich he occasionally emerged to stimulate our lagging pens.\n\nBut I could not learn to see life paragraphically. I longed to give a\npersonal shape to something, and personal shape could not be achieved in a\nparagraph nor in an article. True it is that I longed for art, but I longed\nalso for fame, or was it notoriety? Both. I longed for fame, fame, brutal\nand glaring, fame that leans to notoriety. Out with you, liars that you\nare, tell the truth, say you would sell the souls you don't believe in, or\ndo believe in, for notoriety. I have known you attend funerals for the sake\nof seeing your miserable names in the paper. You, hypocritical reader, who\nare now turning up your eyes and murmuring \"horrid young man\"--examine your\nweakly heart, and see what divides us; I am not ashamed of my appetites, I\nproclaim them, what is more I gratify them; you're silent, you refrain, and\nyou dress up natural sins in hideous garments of shame, you would sell your\nwretched soul for what I would not give the parings of my finger-nails\nfor--paragraphs in a society paper. I am ashamed of nothing I have done,\nespecially my sins, and I boldly confess that I then desired notoriety. I\nwalked along the streets mad; I turned upon myself like a tiger. \"Am I\ngoing to fail again as I have failed before?\" I asked myself. \"Will my\nnovel prove as abortive as my paintings, my poetry, my journalism?\" I\nlooked back upon my life,--mediocrity was branded about my life. \"Would it\nbe the same to the end?\" I asked myself a thousand times by day, and a\nthousand times by night. We all want notoriety, our desire for notoriety is\nhideous if you will, but it is less hideous when it is proclaimed from a\nbrazen tongue than when it hides its head in the cant of human\nhumanitarianism. Humanity be hanged! Self, and after self a friend; the\nrest may go to the devil; and be sure that when any man is more stupidly\nvain and outrageously egotistic than his fellows, he will hide his\nhideousness in humanitarianism. Victor Hugo was hideous with self, and the\ninnermost stench of the humanitarianism he vented about him is unbearable\nto any stomach, not excepting even Mr. Swinburne's, who occasionally holds\nhis nose with one hand while he waves the censer with the other. Humanity\nbe hanged! Men of inferior genius, Victor Hugo and Mr. Gladstone, take\nrefuge in it. Humanity is a pigsty, where liars, hypocrites, and the\nobscene in spirit congregate; it has been so since the great Jew conceived\nit, and it will be so till the end. Far better the blithe modern pagan in\nhis white tie and evening clothes, and his facile philosophy. He says, \"I\ndon't care how the poor live; my only regret is that they live at all;\" and\nhe gives the beggar a shilling.\n\nWe all want notoriety; our desires on this point, as upon others, are not\nnoble, but the human is very despicable vermin and only tolerable when it\ntends to the brute, and away from the evangelical. I will tell you an\nanecdote which is in itself an admirable illustration of my craving for\nnotoriety; and my anecdote will serve a double purpose,--it will bring me\nsome of the notoriety of which I am so desirous, for you, dear, exquisitely\nhypocritical reader, will at once cry, \"Shame! Could a man be so wicked as\nto attempt to force on a duel, so that he might make himself known through\nthe medium of a legal murder?\" You will tell your friends of this horribly\nunprincipled young man, and they will, of course, instantly want to know\nmore about him.\n\nIt was a gala night in Curzon Street, the lords were driving up in hansoms;\nshouts and oaths; some seated on the roofs with their legs swinging inside;\nthe comics had arrived from the halls; there were ladies, many ladies;\nchoruses were going merrily in the drawing-room; one man was attempting to\nkick the chandelier, another stood on his head on the sofa. There was a\nbeautiful young lord there, that sort of figure that no woman can resist.\nThere was a delightful chappie who seemed inclined to empty the mustard-pot\ndown my neck; him I could keep in order, but the beautiful lord I saw was\nattempting to make a butt of me. With his impertinences I did not for a\nmoment intend to put up; I did not know him, he was not then, as he is now,\nif he will allow me to say so, a friend. About three or half-past the\nladies retired, and the festivities continued with unabated vigour. We had\npassed through various stages, not of intoxication, no one was drunk, but\nof jubilation; we had been jocose and rowdy, we had told stories of all\nkinds. The young lord and I did not \"pull well together,\" but nothing\ndecidedly unpleasant occurred until someone proposed to drink to the\ndownfall of Gladstone. The beautiful lord got on his legs and began a\nspeech. Politically it was sound enough, but much of it was plainly\nintended to turn me into ridicule. I answered sharply, working gradually up\ncrescendo, until at last, to bring matters to a head, I said,\n\n\"I don't agree with you; the Land Act of '81 was a necessity.\"\n\n\"Anyone who thinks so must be a fool.\"\n\n\"Very possibly, but I don't allow people to address such language to me,\nand you must be aware that to call anyone a fool, sitting with you at table\nin the house of a friend, is the act of a cad.\"\n\nThere was a lull, then a moment after he said,\n\n\"I only meant politically.\"\n\n\"And I only meant socially.\"\n\nHe advanced a step or two and struck me across the face with his finger\ntips; I took up a champagne bottle, and struck him across the head and\nshoulders. Different parties of revellers kept us apart, and we walked up\nand down on either side of the table swearing at each other. Although I was\nvery wrath, I had had a certain consciousness from the first that if I\nplayed my cards well I might come very well out of the quarrel; and as I\nwalked down the street I determined to make every effort to force on a\nmeeting. If the quarrel had been with one of the music hall singers I\nshould have backed out of it, but I had everything to gain by pressing it.\nI grasped the situation at once. All the Liberal press would be on my side,\nthe Conservative press would have nothing to say against me, no woman in it\nand a duel with a lord in it would be carrion for the society papers. But\nthe danger? To the fear of death I do not think I was ever susceptible. I\nshould have been afraid of a row with a music hall singer, because I should\nhave had much to lose by rowing with him, but as matters stood I had too\nmuch to gain to consider the possibilities of danger. Besides there was no\nneed to consider. I knew very well there was no reality in it. I had broken\nsixteen plates consecutively at the order to fire dozens of times; and yet\nit was three to one against my shooting a man at twenty paces; so it was\nten thousand to one against a man, who had probably only fired off a\nrevolver half-a-dozen times in a back yard, hitting me. In the gallery you\nare firing at white on black, on the ground you are firing at black upon a\nneutral tint, a very different matter. In the gallery there is nothing to\ndisturb you; there is not a man opposite you with a pistol in his hand. In\nthe gallery you are calm and collected, you have risen at your ordinary\nhour, you are returning from a stroll through the sunlight; on the ground\nyour nerves are altered by unusual rising, by cold air, by long\nexpectation. It was three to one against my killing him, it was a hundred\nto one against his killing me. So I calculated the chances, so much as I\ntook the trouble to calculate the chances, but in truth I thought very\nlittle of them; when I want to do anything I do not fear anything, and I\nsincerely wanted to shoot this young man. I did not go to bed at once, but\nsat in the armchair thinking. Presently a cab came rattling up to the door,\nand one of the revellers came upstairs. He told me that everything had been\narranged; I told him that I was not in the habit of allowing others to\narrange my affairs for me, and went to bed. One thing, and only one thing\npuzzled me, who was I to ask to be my second? My old friends were\nscattered, they had disappeared; and among my new acquaintances I could not\nthink of one that would do. None of the Straddlers would do, that was\ncertain; I wanted some one that could be depended upon, and whose social\nposition was above question. Among my old friends I could think of some\nhalf-dozen that would suit me perfectly, but where were they? Ten years'\nabsence scatters friends as October scatters swallows. At last my thoughts\nfixed themselves on one man. I took a hansom and drove to his house. I\nfound him packing up, preparing to go abroad. This was not fortunate. I\ntook a seat on the edge of the dining-room table, and told him I wanted him\nto act for me in an affair of honour. I told him the story in outline. \"I\nsuppose,\" he said, \"it was about one or two in the morning?\"\n\n\"Later than that,\" I said; \"it was about seven.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, he struck you, and not very hard, I should imagine; you\nhit him with a champagne bottle, and now you want to have him out. I don't\nmind acting as intermediary, and settling the affair for you; he will no\ndoubt regret he struck you, and you will regret you struck him; but really\nI cannot act for you, that is to say, if you are determined to force on a\nmeeting. Just think; supposing you were to shoot him, a man who has really\ndone you no wrong.\"\n\n\"My dear ----, I did not come here to listen to moral reflections; if you\ndon't like to act for me, say so.\"\n\nI telegraphed to Warwickshire to an old friend:--\"Can I count on you to act\nfor me in an affair of honour?\" Two or three hours after the reply came.\n\"Come down here and stay with me for a few days, we'll talk it over.\" I\nground my teeth; what was to be done? I must wire to Marshall and ask him\nto come over; English people evidently will have nothing to do with serious\nduelling. \"Of all importance. Come over at once and act for me in an affair\nof honour. Bring the count with you; leave him at Boulogne; he knows the\ncolonel of the ----.\" The next day I received the following: \"Am burying my\nfather; so soon as he is underground will come.\" Was there ever such\nluck?... He won't be here before the end of the week. These things demand\nthe utmost promptitude. Three or four days afterwards dreadful Emma told me\na gentleman was upstairs taking a bath. \"Holloa, Marshall, how are you? Had\na good crossing? Awful good of you to come.... The poor old gentleman went\noff quite suddenly, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; found dead in his bed. He must have known he was dying, for he lay\nquite straight as the dead lie, his hands by his side ... wonderful\npresence of mind.\"\n\n\"He left no money?\"\n\n\"Not a penny; but I could manage it all right. Since my success at the\nSalon, I have been able to sell my things. I am only beginning to find out\nnow what a success that picture was. _Je t'assure, je fais\nl'\u00c3\u00a9cole._\"...\n\n\"_Tu crois \u00c3\u00a7a ... on fait l'\u00c3\u00a9cole apr\u00c3\u00a8s vingt ans de travail._\"\n\n\"_Mon ami, je t'assure, j'ai un public qui me suit._\"\n\n\"_Mon ami, veux-tu que je te dis ce que tu a fait; tu a fait encore une\nvulgarization, une jolie vulgarization, je veux bien, de la note invent\u00c3\u00a9e\npar Millet; tu a ajout\u00c3\u00a9 la note claire invent\u00c3\u00a9e par Manet, enfin tu suis\navec talent le mouvement moderne, voil\u00c3\u00a0 tout._\"\n\n\"_Parlons d'autre chose: sur la question d'art on ne s'entend jamais._\"\n\nWhen we were excited Marshall and I always dropped into French.\n\n\"And now tell me,\" he said, \"about this duel.\"\n\nI could not bring myself to admit, even to Marshall, that I was willing to\nshoot a man for the sake of the notoriety it would bring me, not because I\nfeared in him any revolt of conscience, but because I dreaded his sneers;\nhe was known to all Paris, I was an obscure something, living in an obscure\nlodging in London. Had Marshall suspected the truth he would have said\npityingly, \"My dear Dayne, how can you be so foolish? why will you not be\ncontented to live?\" etc.... Such homilies would have been maddening; he was\nsuccessful, I was not; I knew there was not much in him, _un feu de\npaille_, no more, but what would I not have done and given for that\n_feu de paille_? So I was obliged to conceal my real motives for\ndesiring a duel, and I spoke strenuously of the gravity of the insult and\nthe necessity of retribution. But Marshall was obdurate. \"Insult?\" he said.\n\"He hit you with his hand, you hit him with the champagne bottle; you can't\nhave him out after that, there is nothing to avenge, you wiped out the\ninsult yourself; if you had not struck him with the champagne bottle the\ncase would be different.\"\n\nWe went out to dine, we went to the theatre, and after the theatre we went\nhome and aestheticised till three in the morning. I spoke no more of the\nduel, I was sick of it; luck, I saw, was against me, and I let Marshall\nhave his way. He showed his usual tact, a letter was drawn up in which my\nfriend withdrew the blow of his hand, I withdrew the blow of the bottle,\nand the letter was signed by Marshall and two other gentlemen.\n\nHypocritical reader, you draw your purity garments round you, you say, \"How\nvery base;\" but I say unto you remember how often you have longed, if you\nare a soldier in her Majesty's army, for war,--war that would bring every\nform of sorrow to a million fellow-creatures, and you longed for all this\nto happen, because it might bring your name into the _Gazette_.\nHypocritical reader, think not too hardly of me; hypocritical reader, think\nwhat you like of me, your hypocrisy will alter nothing; in telling you of\nmy vices I am only telling you of your own; hypocritical reader, in showing\nyou my soul I am showing you your own; hypocritical reader, exquisitely\nhypocritical reader, you are my brother, I salute you.\n\nDay passed over day: I lived in that horrible lodging; I continued to\nlabour at my novel; it seemed an impossible task--defeat glared at me from\nevery corner of that frouzy room. My English was so bad, so thin,--stupid\ncolloquialisms out of joint with French idiom. I learnt unusual words and\nstuck them up here and there; they did not mend the style. Self-reliance\nhad been lost in past failures; I was weighed down on every side, but I\nstruggled to bring the book somehow to a close. Nothing mattered to me, but\nthis one thing. To put an end to the landlady's cheating, and to bind\nmyself to remain at home, I entered into an arrangement with her that she\nwas to supply me with board and lodgings for three pounds a week, and\nhenceforth resisting all Curzon Street temptations, I trudge home through\nNovember fogs, to eat a chop in a frouzy lodging-house. I studied the\nhorrible servant as one might an insect under a microscope. \"What an\nadmirable book she would make, but what will the end be? if I only knew the\nend!\" I had more and more difficulty in keeping the fat landlady at arm's\nlength, and the nasty child was well beaten one day for lingering about my\ndoor. I saw poor Miss L. nightly, on the stairs of this infamous house, and\nI never wearied of talking to her of her hopes and ambitions, of the young\nman she admired. She used to ask me about my novel.\n\nPoor Miss L.! Where is she? I do not know, but I shall not forget the time\nwhen I used to listen for her footstep on the midnight stairs. Often I was\ntoo despondent, when my troubles lay too heavily and darkly upon me, I let\nher go up to her garret without a word. Despondent days and nights when I\ncried, Shall I never pass from this lodging? shall I never be a light in\nthat London, long, low, misshapen, that dark monumental stream flowing\nthrough the lean bridges; and what if I were a light in this umber-coloured\nmass,--shadows falling, barges moored midway in a monumental stream?\nHappiness abides only in the natural affections--in a home and a sweet\nwife. Would she whom I saw to-night marry me? How sweet she was in her\nsimple naturalness, the joys she has known have been slight and pure, not\nviolent and complex as mine. Ah, she is not for me, I am not fit for her, I\nam too sullied for her lips.... Were I to win her could I be dutiful,\ntrue?...\n\n\"Young men, young men whom I love, dear ones who have rejoiced with me, not\nthe least of our pleasures is the virtuous woman; after excesses there is\nreaction, all things are good in nature, and they are foolish young men who\nthink that sin alone should be sought for. The feast is over for me, I have\neaten and drunk; I yield my place, do you eat and drink as I have; do you\nbe young as I was. I have written it! The word is not worth erasure, if it\nis not true to-day it will be in two years hence; farewell! I yield my\nplace, do you be young as I was, do you love youth as I did; remember you\nare the most interesting beings under heaven, for you all sacrifices will\nbe made, you will be f\u00c3\u00aated and adored upon the condition of remaining young\nmen. The feast is over for me, I yield my place, but I will not make this\nleavetaking more sorrowful than it is already by afflicting you with advice\nand instruction how to obtain what I have obtained. I have spoken bitterly\nagainst education, I will not strive to educate you, you will educate\nyourselves. Dear ones, dear ones, the world is your pleasure, you can use\nit at your will. Dear ones, I see you all about me still, I yield my place;\nbut one more glass I will drink with you; and while drinking I would say my\nlast word--were it possible I would be remembered by you as a young man:\nbut I know too well that the young never realise that the old were not born\nold. Farewell.\"\n\nI shivered; the cold air of morning blew in my face, I closed the window,\nand sitting at the table, haggard and overworn, I continued my novel.\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Confessions of a Young Man, by George Moore\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CONFESSIONS OF A YOUNG MAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11654-8.txt or 11654-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/1\/6\/5\/11654\/\n\nProduced by David Newman and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year. For example:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":199,"split":"train"}
