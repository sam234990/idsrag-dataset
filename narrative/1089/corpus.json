{"ori_id":"fc724594f1ffb52d1101209b11cebc95700ee082","title":"Faust, Part One","context":"Faust, Part One\n The first part of Faust is not divided into acts, but is structured as a sequence of scenes in a variety of settings. After a dedicatory poem and a prelude in the theater, the actual plot begins with a prologue in Heaven, where the Lord challenges Mephistopheles, the Devil, that Mephistopheles cannot lead astray the Lord's favourite striving scholar, Dr. Faust. We then see Faust in his study, who, disappointed of science with natural means, attempts and fails to gain knowledge of nature and the universe by magical ones. The dejected Faust contemplates suicide, but is held back by the sounds of the beginning Easter celebrations. He joins his assistant Wagner for an Easter walk in the countryside, among the celebrating people, and is followed home by a poodle. Back in the study, the poodle transforms itself into Mephistopheles, who offers Faust a contract: he will do Faust's bidding on earth, and Faust will do the same for him in hell (if, as Faust adds in an important side clause, Mephisto can get him to be satisfied and to want a moment to last forever). Faust signs in blood, and Mephisto first takes him to Auerbach's tavern in Leipzig, where the devil plays tricks on some drunken revellers. Having then been transformed into a young man by a witch, Faust encounters Margaret (Gretchen) and she excites his desires. Through a scheme involving jewellery and Gretchen's neighbour Marthe, Mephisto brings about Faust's and Gretchen's liaison. After a period of separation, Faust seduces Gretchen, who accidentally kills her mother with a sleeping potion Faust had given her. Gretchen is pregnant, and her torment is further increased when Faust and Mephisto kill her enraged brother in a sword fight. Mephisto seeks to distract Faust by taking him to the witches' sabbath of Walpurgis Night, but Faust insists on rescuing Gretchen from the death sentence she has been given after going insane and drowning her newborn child. In the dungeon, Faust in vain tries to persuade Gretchen to follow him to freedom. At the end of the drama, as Faust and Mephisto flee the dungeon, a voice from heaven announces Gretchen's salvation.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Faust Part 1, by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe\n#32 in our series by Goethe\n\nSee also etexts numbers 2229 and 2230 for editions of this etext\nin German.\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

His father was a man of means and position, and he\npersonally supervised the early education of his son. The young\nGoethe studied at the universities of Leipsic and Strasburg, and in\n1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation\nof Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in\nWeimar, where he held a succession of political offices, becoming\nthe Duke's chief adviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy,\nand from 179' to 1817 directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He\ntook part in the wars against France, 1792-3, and in the following\nyear began his friendship with Schiller, which lasted till the latter's\ndeath in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. From about\n1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a life of\nextraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832.\nThe most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to\nWeimar were his tragedy \"Gotz von Berlichingen\" (1773), which\nfirst brought him fame, and \"The Sorrows of Young Werther,\" a\nnovel which obtained enormous popularity during the so-called\n\"Sturm und Drang\" period. During the years at Weimar before he\nknew Schiller he began \"Wilhelm Meister,\" wrote the dramas,\n\"Iphigenie,\" \"Egmont,\" and \"Torquato Tasso,\" and his \"Reinecke\nFuchs.\" To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the\ncontinuation of \"Wilhelm Meister,\" the beautiful idyl of \"Hermann\nand Dorothea,\" and the \"Roman Elegies.\" In the last period,\nbetween Schiller's death in 1805 and his own, appeared \"Faust,\"\n\"Elective Affinities,\" his autobiographical \"Dichtung und\nWahrheit\" (\"Poetry and Truth\"), his \"Italian Journey,\" much\nscientific work, and a series of treatises on German Art.\n\nThough the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection front\nthe titles of Goethe's best known writings, it suffices to show the\nextraordinary fertility and versatility of his genius. Rarely has a\nman of letters had so full and varied a life, or been capable of so\nmany-sided a development. His political and scientific activities,\nthough dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic\nproduction, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most\ndiverse directions, and helped to give him that balance of temper\nand breadth of vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius\nof the ancient or modern world.\n\nThe greatest and most representative expression of Goethe's\npowers is without doubt to be found in his drama of \"Faust\"; but\nbefore dealing with Goethe's masterpiece, it is worth while to say\nsomething of the history of the story on which it is founded--the\nmost famous instance of the old and widespread legend of the man\nwho sold his soul to the devil. The historical Dr. Faust seems to\nhave been a self-called philosopher who traveled about Germany\nin the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the\npractise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died\nmysteriously about 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the\ndevil, by whose aid he wrought his wonders, had finally carried\nhim off. In 1587 a life of him appeared, in which are attributed to\nhim many marvelous exploits and in which he is held up as an\nawful warning against the excessive desire for secular learning and\nadmiration for antique beauty which characterized the humanist\nmovement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an\nexpression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to\nthe scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.\n\nWhile a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the\noriginal life was translated into English and dramatized by\nMarlowe. English players brought Marlowe's work back to\nGermany, where it was copied by German actors, degenerated into\nspectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show. Through this\npuppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.\n\nBy the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had\nfascinated his imagination; for three years before he went to\nWeimar he had been working on scattered scenes and bits of\ndialogue; and though he suspended actual composition on it during\nthree distinct periods, it was always to resume, and he closed his\nlabors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between\nhis first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years.\nDuring this period the plans for the structure and the signification\nof the work inevitably underwent profound modifications, and\nthese have naturally affected the unity of the result; but, on the\nother hand, this long companionship and persistent recurrence to\nthe task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the\nrecord of Goethe's personality in all its richness and diversity.\n\nThe drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then\nthe completed First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second\nPart was published in 1833, the year after the author's death.\nWriting in \"Dichtung und Wahrheit\" of the period about 1770,\nwhen he was in Strasburg with. Herder, Goethe says, \"The\nsignificant puppet-play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in many\ntones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and\nearly enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had\nmade all sorts of experiments in life, and had always come back\nmore unsatisfied and more tormented. I was now carrying these\nthings, like many others, about with me and delighting myself with\nthem in lonely hours, but without writing anything down.\" Without\ngoing into the details of the experience which underlies these\nwords, we can see the be ginning of that sympathy with the hero of\nthe old story that was the basis of its fascination and that\naccounted for Goethe's departure from the traditional catastrophe\nof Faust's damnation.\n\nOf the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the\nlegend a rough idea may be obtained from the \"Doctor Faustus\" of\nMarlowe, printed in the present volume. As early as 1674 a life of\nFaust had contained the incident of the philosopher's falling in love\nwith a servant-girl; but the developed story of Gretchen is Goethe's\nown. The other elements added to the plot can be noted by a\ncomparison with Marlowe.\n\nIt need hardly be said that Goethe's \"Faust\" does not derive its\ngreatness from its conformity to the traditional standards of what a\ntragedy should be. He himself was accustomed to refer to it\ncynically as a monstrosity, and yet he put himself into it as\nintensely as Dante put himself into \"The Divine Comedy.\" A\npartial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author's\nattitude is to be found in what has been said of its manner of\ncomposition. Goethe began it in his romantic youth, and availed\nhimself recklessly of the supernatural elements in the legend, with\nthe disregard of reason and plausibility characteristic of the\nromantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of the new\ncentury his artistic standards had changed, and the supernaturalism\ncould now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he\nmakes the career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of\nthe persistent striving for the ideal over the temptation to find\ncomplete satisfaction in the sense, and prepares the reader for this\ninterpretation by prefixing the \"Prologue in Heaven.\" The\nelaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such scenes\nas the Walpurgis Night and the Intermezzo, scenes full of power\nand infinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as\na tragedy of human life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in\nits final form much that is realistic in the best sense, the carousal\nin Auerbach's cellar, the portrait of Martha, the Easter-morning\nwalk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is such elements as\nthese that have appealed to the larger reading public and that have\nnaturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by\nvirtue of these alone \"Faust\" may rank as a great drama; but it is\nthe result of Goethe's broodings on the mystery of human life,\nshadowed forth in the symbolic parts and elaborated with still\ngreater complexity and still more far-reaching suggestiveness--and,\nit must be added, with deepening obscurity--in the Second Part,\nthat have given the work its place with \"Job,\" with the\n\"Prometheus Bound,\" with \"The Divine Comedy,\" and with\n\"Hamlet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDedication\n\nYE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me,\nAs erst upon my troubled sight ye stole;\nShall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye?\nStill for the fond illusion yearns my soul?\nYe press around! Come then, your captive hold me,\nAs upward from the vapoury mist ye roll;\nWithin my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding,\nFann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.\n\nShades fondly loved appear, your train attending,\nAnd visions fair of many a blissful day;\nFirst-love and friendship their fond accents blending,\nLike to some ancient, half-expiring lay;\nSorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending\nBack o'er life's devious labyrinthine way,\nAnd names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving\nOf life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.\n\nThey hear me not my later cadence singing,\nThe souls to whom my earlier lays I sang;\nDispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging;\nMute are the voices that responsive rang.\nFor stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing,\nE'en their applause is to my heart a pang;\nOf old who listened to my song, glad hearted,\nIf yet they live, now wander widely parted.\n\nA yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying,\nTo yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul;\nIn faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing,\nFans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll;\nTear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying\nThe tender impulse, loses its control;\nWhat I possess as from afar I see;\nThose I have lost become realities to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE FOR THE THEATRE\n\nMANAGER.  DRAMATIC POET.  MERRYMAN.\n\nMANAGER\n\nYE twain, in trouble and distress\nTrue friends whom I so oft have found,\nSay, for our scheme on German ground,\nWhat prospect have we of success?\nFain would I please the public, win their thanks;\nThey live and let live, hence it is but meet.\nThe posts are now erected, and the planks,\nAnd all look forward to a festal treat.\nTheir places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd,\nSit patiently, and fain would be amaz'd.\nI know the art to hit the public taste,\nYet ne'er of failure felt so keen a dread;\nTrue, they are not accustomed to the best,\nBut then appalling the amount they've read..\nHow make our entertainment striking, new,\nAnd yet significant and pleasing too?\nFor to be plain, I love to see the throng,\nAs to our booth the living tide progresses;\nAs wave on wave successive rolls along,\nAnd through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses;\nStill in broad daylight, ere the clock strikes four,\nWith blows their way towards the box they take;\nAnd, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door,\nFor tickets are content their necks to break.\nSuch various minds the bard alone can sway,\nMy friend, oh work this miracle to-day!\n\nPOET\n\nOh of the motley throng speak not before me,\nAt whose aspect the Spirit wings its flight!\n\nConceal the surging concourse, I implore thee,\nWhose vortex draws us with resistless might.\nNo, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore me,\nWhere only for the bard blooms pure delight,\nWhere love and friendship yield their choicest blessing,\nOur heart's true bliss, with god-like hand caressing.\n\nWhat in the spirit's depths was there created,\nWhat shyly there the lip shaped forth in sound;\nA failure now, with words now fitly mated,\nIn the wild tumult of the hour is drown'd;\nFull oft the poet's thought for years bath waited\nUntil at length with perfect form 'tis crowned;\nWhat dazzles, for the moment born, must perish;\nWhat genuine is posterity will cherish.\n\nMERRYMAN\n\nThis cant about posterity I hate;\nAbout posterity were I to prate,\nWho then the living would amuse? For they\nWill have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due.\nA sprightly fellow's presence at your play,\nMethinks should also count for something too;\nWhose genial wit the audience still inspires,\nKnows from their changeful mood no angry feeling;\nA wider circle he desires,\nTo their heart's depths more surely thus appealing.\nTo work, then!

Philosophy,\nMedicine, Jurisprudence too,\nAnd to my cost Theology,\nWith ardent labour, studied through.\nAnd here I stand, with all my lore,\nPoor fool, no wiser than before.\nMagister, doctor styled, indeed,\nAlready these ten years I lead,\nUp, down, across, and to and fro,\nMy pupils by the nose,--and learn,\nThat we in truth can nothing know!\nThat in my heart like fire doth burn.\n'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe,\nMagister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;\nScruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,\nNeither can devil nor hell now appal me--\nHence also my heart must all pleasure forego!\nI may not pretend, aught rightly to know,\nI may not pretend, through teaching, to find\nA means to improve or convert mankind.\nThen I have neither goods nor treasure,\nNo worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;\nNo dog in such fashion would longer live!\nTherefore myself to magic I give,\nIn hope, through spirit-voice and might,\nSecrets now veiled to bring to light,\nThat I no more, with aching brow,\nNeed speak of what I nothing know;\nThat I the force may recognise\nThat binds creation's inmost energies;\nHer vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,\nAnd fling the trade in empty words away.\nO full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays\nTheir last upon mine anguish gaze!\nBeside this desk, at dead of night,\nOft have I watched to hail thy light:\nThen, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll,\nWith soothing power, thy radiance stole!\nIn thy dear light, ah, might I climb,\nFreely, some mountain height sublime,\nRound mountain caves with spirits ride,\nIn thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,\nAnd, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew\nMy spirit, in thy healing dew!\nWoe's me! still prison'd in the gloom\nOf this abhorr'd and musty room!\nWhere heaven's dear light itself doth pass,\nBut dimly through the painted glass!\nHemmed in by book-heaps, piled around,\nWorm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould,\nWhich to the high vault's topmost bound,\nA smoke-stained paper doth enfold;\nWith boxes round thee piled, and glass,\nAnd many a useless instrument,\nWith old ancestral lumber blent--\nThis is thy world! a world! alas!\nAnd dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,\nWith tighten'd pressure in thy breast?\nWhy the dull ache will not depart,\nBy which thy life-pulse is oppress'd?\nInstead of nature's living sphere,\nCreated for mankind of old,\nBrute skeletons surround thee here,\nAnd dead men's bones in smoke and mould.\n\nUp! Forth into the distant land!\nIs not this book of mystery\nBy Nostradamus' proper hand,\nAn all-sufficient guide? Thou'lt see\nThe courses of the stars unroll'd;\nWhen nature doth her thoughts unfold\nTo thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek\nCommunion high with her to hold,\nAs spirit doth with spirit speak!\nVain by dull poring to divine\nThe meaning of each hallow'd sign.\nSpirits! I feel you hov'ring near;\nMake answer, if my voice ye hear!\n\n(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)\n\nAh! at this spectacle through every sense,\nWhat sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing!\nI feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense,\nThrough every nerve and vein with ardour glowing.\nWas it a god who character'd this scroll,\nThe tumult in my spirit healing,\nO'er my sad heart with rapture stealing,\nAnd by a mystic impulse, to my soul,\nThe powers of nature all around revealing.\nAm I a God? What light intense!\nIn these pure symbols do I see,\nNature exert her vital energy.\nNow of the wise man's words I learn the sense;\n\n\"Unlock'd the spirit-world is lying,\nThy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!\nUp scholar, lave, with zeal undying,\nThine earthly breast in the morning-red!\"\n(He contemplates the sign.)\n\nHow all things live and work, and ever blending,\nWeave one vast whole from Being's ample range!\nHow powers celestial, rising and descending,\nTheir golden buckets ceaseless interchange!\nTheir flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,\nFrom heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,\nThrough the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!\n\nA wondrous show! but ah! a show alone!\nWhere shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where?\nYe breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon\nHang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart\nFor solace yearns, ye still impart\nYour sweet and fostering tides--where are ye--where?\nYe gush, and must I languish in despair?\n(He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives\nthe sign of the Earth-spirit.)\n\nHow all unlike the influence of this sign!\nEarth-spirit, thou to me art nigher,\nE'en now my strength is rising higher,\nE'en now I glow as with new wine;\nCourage I feel, abroad the world to dare,\n\nThe woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,\nWith storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare,\nAnd mid the crashing shipwreck not despair.\n\nClouds gather over me--\nThe moon conceals her light--\nThe lamp is quench'd--\nVapours are rising--\nQuiv'ring round my head\nFlash the red beams--\nDown from the vaulted roof\nA shuddering horror floats,\nAnd seizes me!\nI feel it, spirit, prayer-compell'd, 'tis thou\nArt hovering near!\nUnveil thyself!\nHa! How my heart is riven now!\nEach sense, with eager palpitation,\nIs strain'd to catch some new sensation!\nI feel my heart surrender'd unto thee!\nThou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee!\n(He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign\nof the spirit. A ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the\nflame.)\n\nSPIRIT\n\nWho calls me?\nFAUST (turning aside)\nDreadful shape!\n\nSPIRIT\n\nWith might, thou hast compelled me to appear,\nLong hast been sucking at my sphere,\nAnd now--\n\nFAUST\n\nWoe's me! I cannot bear the sight!\n\nSPIRIT\n\nTo see me thou dost breathe thine invocation,\nMy voice to hear, to gaze upon my brow;\nMe doth thy strong entreaty bow--\nLo! I am here I--What cowering agitation\nGrasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry?\nWhere is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd\nAnd bore and cherished? which, with ecstasy,\nTo rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved?\nWhere art thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound,\nWho towards me press'd with energy profound?\nArt thou he? Thou,--who by my breath art blighted,\nWho, in his spirit's depths affrighted,\nTrembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!\n\nFAUST\n\nShall I yield, thing of flame, to thee?\nFaust, and thine equal, I am he!\n\nSPIRIT\n\nIn the currents of life, in action's storm,\nI float and I wave\nWith billowy motion!\nBirth and the grave\nA limitless ocean,\nA constant weaving\nWith change still rife,\nA restless heaving,\nA glowing life--\nThus time's whirring loom unceasing I ply,\nAnd weave the life-garment of deity.\n\nFAUST\n\nThou, restless spirit, dost from end to end\nO'ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee!\n\nSPIRIT\n\nThou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend,\nNot me!   (Vanishes.)\n\nFAUST (deeply moved)\n\nI, God's own image!\nAnd not rank with thee!  (A knock.)\nOh death! I know it--'tis my famulus--\nMy fairest fortune now escapes!\nThat all these visionary shapes\nA soulless groveller should banish thus!\n(WAGNER in his dressing gown and night-cap, a lamp\nin his hand. FAUST turns round reluctantly.)\n\nWAGNER\n\nPardon! I heard you here declaim;\nA Grecian tragedy you doubtless read?\nImprovement in this art is now my aim,\nFor now-a-days it much avails. Indeed\nAn actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher,\nMay give instruction to a preacher.\n\nFAUST\n\nAy, if your priest should be an actor too,\nAs not improbably may come to pass.\n\nWAGNER\n\nWhen in his study pent the whole year through,\nMan views the world, as through an optic glass,\nOn a chance holiday, and scarcely then,\nHow by persuasion can he govern men?\n\nFAUST\n\nIf feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow\nFresh from the spirit's depths, with strong control\nSwaying to rapture every listener's soul,\nIdle your toil; the chase you may forego!\nBrood o'er your task! Together glue,\nCook from another's feast your own ragout,\nStill prosecute your paltry game,\nAnd fan your ash-heaps into flame!\n'Thus children's wonder you'll excite,\nAnd apes', if such your appetite;\nBut that which issues from the heart alone,\nWill bend tile hearts of others to your own.\n\nWAGNER\n\nThe speaker in delivery will find\nSuccess alone; I still am far behind.\n\nFAUST\n\nA worthy object still pursue!\nBe not a hollow tinkling fool!\nSound understanding, judgment true,\nFind utterance without art or rule;\nAnd when in earnest you are moved to speak,\nThen is it needful cunning words to seek?\nYour fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind,\nWherein the shreds of human thought ye twist,\nAre unrefreshing as the empty wind,\nWhistling through wither'd leaves and autumn mist!\n\nWAGNER\n\nOh God! How long is art,\nOur life how short! With earnest zeal\nStill as I ply the critic's task, I feel\nA strange oppression both of head and heart.\nThe very means how hardly are they won,\nBy which we to the fountains rise!\nAnd haply, ere one half the course is run,\nCheck'd in his progress, the poor devil dies.\n\nFAUST\n\nParchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll\nWaters, he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed?\nOh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul,\nThou has not won the life-restoring draught.\n\nWAGNER\n\nYour pardon! 'tis delightful to transport\nOneself into the spirit of the past,\nTo see in times before us how a wise man thought,\nAnd what a glorious height we have achieved at last.\n\nFAUST\nAy truly! even to the loftiest star!\nTo us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd\nA book with seven seals, close-fasten'd, are;\nAnd what the spirit of the times men call,\nIs merely their own spirit after all,\nWherein, distorted oft, the times are glass'd.\nThen truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul!\nAt the first glance we fly it in dismay;\nA very lumber-room, a rubbish-hole;\nAt best a sort of mock-heroic play,\nWith saws pragmatical, and maxims sage,\nTo suit the puppets and their mimic stage.\n\nWAGNER\n\nBut then the world and man, his heart and brain!\nTouching these things all men would something know.\n\nFAUST\n\nAy! what 'mong men as knowledge doth obtain!\nWho on the child its true name dares bestow?\nThe few who somewhat of these things have known,\nWho their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd,\nNor thoughts, nor feelings, from the mob conceal'd,\nHave died on crosses, or in flames been thrown.--\nExcuse me, friend, far now the night is spent,\nFor this time we must say adieu.\n\nWAGNER\n\nStill to watch on I had been well content,\nThus to converse so learnedly with you.\nBut as to-morrow will be Easter-day,\nSome further questions grant, I pray;\nWith diligence to study still I fondly cling;\nAlready I know much, but would know everything.\n(Exit.)\n\nFAUST (alone)\n\nHow him alone all hope abandons never,\nTo empty trash who clings, with zeal untired,\nWith greed for treasure gropes, and, joy-inspir'd,\nExults if earth-worms second his endeavour.\n\nAnd dare a voice of merely human birth,\nE'en here, where shapes immortal throng'd, intrude?\nYet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth,\nFor once, I e'en to thee feel gratitude.\nDespair the power of sense did well-nigh blast,\nAnd thou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd,\nSo giant-like the vision seem'd, so vast,\nI felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd!\n\nI, God's own image, from this toil of clay\nAlready freed, with eager joy who hail'd\nThe mirror of eternal truth unveil'd,\nMid light effulgent and celestial day:--\nI, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul\nWith penetrative glance aspir'd to flow\nThrough nature's veins, and, still creating, know\nThe life of gods,--how am I punish'd now!\nOne thunder-word hath hurl'd me from the goal!\n\nSpirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere.\nWhat though my power compell'd thee to appear,\nMy art was powerless to detain thee here.\nIn that great moment, rapture-fraught,\nI felt myself so small, so great;\nFiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought\nBack on humanity's uncertain fate!\nWho'll teach me now?

Oh, I shall die!\n\nMARGARET\n\nAlas! good Martha! don't despair!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nNow listen to the sad affair!\n\nMARGARET\n\nI for this cause should fear to love.\nThe loss my certain death would prove.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nJoy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend.\n\nMARTHA\n\nProceed, and tell the story of his end!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nAt Padua, in St. Anthony's,\nIn holy ground his body lies;\nQuiet and cool his place of rest,\nWith pious ceremonials blest.\n\nMARTHA\n\nAnd had you naught besides to bring?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nOh yes! one grave and solemn prayer;\nLet them for him three hundred masses sing!\nBut in my pockets, I have nothing there.\n\nMARTHA\n\nNo trinket! no love-token did he send!\nWhat every journeyman safe in his pouch will hoard\nThere for remembrance fondly stored,\nAnd rather hungers, rather begs than spend!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nMadam, in truth, it grieves me sore,\nBut he his gold not lavishly bath spent.\nHis failings too he deeply did repent,\nAy! and his evil plight bewail'd still more.\n\nMARGARET\n\nAlas! That men should thus be doomed to woe!\nI for his soul will many a requiem pray.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nA husband you deserve this very day;\nA child so worthy to be loved.\n\nMARGARET\n\nAh no,\nThat time bath not yet come for me.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nIf not a spouse, a gallant let it be.\nAmong heaven's choicest gifts, I place,\nSo sweet a darling to embrace.\n\nMARGARET\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nUsage or not, it happens so.\n\nMARTHA\n\nGo on, I pray!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nI stood by his bedside. Something less foul it was than dung;\n'Twas straw half rotten; yet, he as a Christian died.\nAnd sorely hath remorse his conscience wrung.\n\"Wretch that I was,\" quoth he, with parting breath,\n\"So to forsake my business and my wife!\nAh! the remembrance is my death,\nCould I but have her pardon in this life! \"--\n\nMARTHA (weeping)\n\nDear soul! I've long forgiven him, indeed!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\n\"Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I.\"\n\nMARTHA\n\nHe lied! What, on the brink of death to lie!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nIf I am skill'd the countenance to read,\nHe doubtless fabled as he parted hence.--\n\"No time had I to gape, or take my ease,\" he said,\n\"First to get children, and then get them bread;\nAnd bread, too, in the very widest sense;\nNor could I eat in peace even my proper share.\"\n\nMARTHA\n\nWhat, all my truth, my love forgotten quite?\nMy weary drudgery by day and night!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nNot so! He thought of you with tender care.\nQuoth he: \"Heaven knows how fervently I prayed,\nFor wife and children when from Malta bound;--\nThe prayer hath heaven with favour crowned;\nWe took a Turkish vessel which conveyed\nRich store of treasure for the Sultan's court;\nIt's own reward our gallant action brought;\nThe captur'd prize was shared among the crew\nAnd of the treasure I received my due.\"\n\nMARTHA\n\nHow?

MARTHA with\nMEPHISTOPHELES walking up and down\n\nMARGARET\n\nI feel it, you but spare my ignorance,\nThe gentleman to shame me stoops thus low.\nA traveller from complaisance,\nStill makes the best of things; I know\nToo well, my humble prattle never can\nHave power to entertain so wise a man.\n\nFAUST\n\nOne glance, one word from thee doth charm me more,\nThan the world's wisdom or the sage's lore.\n(He kisses her hand.)\n\nMARGARET\n\nNay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse,\nSo rude as mine, how can you kiss!\nWhat constant work at home must I not do perforce!\nMy mother too exacting is.\n(They pass on.)\n\nMARTHA\n\nThus, sir, unceasing travel is your lot?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nTraffic and duty urge us!

No maid we keep,\nAnd I must cook, sew, knit, and Sweep,\nStill early on my feet and late;\nMy mother is in all things, great and small,\nSo accurate!\nNot that for thrift there is such pressing need;\nThan others we might make more show indeed;\nMy father left behind a small estate,\nA house and garden near the city-wall.\nBut fairly quiet now my days, I own;\nAs soldier is my brother gone;\nMy little sister's dead; the babe to rear\nOccasion'd me some care and fond annoy;\nBut I would go through all again with joy,\nThe darling was to me so dear.\n\nFAUST\n\nAn angel, sweet, if it resembled thee!\n\nMARGARET\n\nI reared it up, and it grew fond of me.\nAfter my father's death it saw the day;\nWe gave my mother up for lost, she lay\nIn such a wretched plight, and then at length\nSo very slowly she regain'd her strength.\nWeak as she was, 'twas vain for her to try\nHerself to suckle the poor babe, so I\nReared it on milk and water all alone;\nAnd thus the child became as 'twere roy own;\nWithin my arms it stretched itself and grew,\nAnd smiling, nestled in my bosom too.\n\nFAUST\n\nDoubtless the purest happiness was thine.\n\nMARGARET\n\nBut many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine.\nAt night its little cradle stood\nClose to my bed; so was I wide awake\nIf it but stirred;\nOne while I was obliged to give it food,\nOr to my arms the darling take;\nFrom bed full oft must rise, whene'er its cry I heard,\nAnd, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and fro;\nStand at the wash-tub early; forthwith go\nTo market, and then mind the cooking too--\nTo-morrow like to-day, the whole year through.\nAh, sir, thus living, it must be confess'd\nOne's spirits are not always of the best;\nYet it a relish gives to food and rest.\n(They pass on.)\n\nMARTHA\n\nPoor women! we are badly off, I own;\nA bachelor's conversion's hard, indeed!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nMadam, with one like you it rests alone,\nTo tutor me a better course to lead.\n\nMARTHA\n\nSpeak frankly, sir, none is there you have met?\nHas your heart ne'er attach'd itself as yet?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nOne's own fire-side and a good wife are gold\nAnd pearls of price, so says the proverb old.\n\nMARTHA\n\nI mean, has passion never stirred your breast?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nI've everywhere been well received, I own.\n\nMARTHA\n\nYet hath your heart no earnest preference known?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nWith ladies one should ne'er presume to jest.\n\nMARTHA\n\nAh! you mistake!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nI'm sorry I'm so blind!\nBut this I know--that you are very kind.\n(They pass on.)\n\nFAUST\n\nMe, little angel, didst thou recognise,\nWhen in the garden first I came?\n\nMARGARET\nDid you not see it? I cast down my eyes.\n\nFAUST\nThou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame\nThe liberty I took that day,\nWhen thou from church didst lately wend thy way?\n\nMARGARET\n\nI was confused. So had it never been;\nNo one of me could any evil say.\nAlas, thought I, he doubtless in thy mien,\nSomething unmaidenly or bold hath seen?\nIt seemed as if it struck him suddenly,\nHere's just a girl with whom one may make free!\nYet I must own that then I scarcely knew\nWhat in your favour here began at once to plead;\nYet I was angry with myself indeed,\nThat I more angry could not feel with you.\n\nFAUST\n\nSweet love!\n\nMARGARET\n\nJust wait awhile!\n(She gathers a star-flower and plucks off the leaves one after\nanother.)\n\nFAUST\n\nA nosegay may that be?\n\nMARGARET\n\nNo! It is but a game.\n\nFAUST\n\nHow?\n\nMARGARET\n\nGo, you'll laugh at me!\n(She plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself.)\n\nFAUST\n\nWhat murmurest thou?\n\nMARGARET (half aloud)'\n\nHe loves me--loves me not.\n\nFAUST\n\nSweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss!\n\nMARGARET (continues)\n\nHe loves me--not--he loves me--not--\n(Plucking off the last leaf with fond joy.)\n\nHe loves me!\n\nFAUST\n\nYes!\nAnd this flower-language, darling, let it be,\nA heavenly oracle! He loveth thee!\nKnow'st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee?\n(He seizes both her hands.)\n\nMARGARET\n\nI tremble so!\n\nFAUST\n\nNay! Do not tremble, love!\nLet this hand-pressure, let this glance reveal\nFeelings, all power of speech above;\nTo give oneself up wholly and to feel\nA joy that must eternal prove!\nEternal!--Yes, its end would be despair.\nNo end!--It cannot end!\n(MARGARET presses his hand, extricates herself,\nand runs away. He stands a moment in thought, and then follows\nher.)\n\n\nMARTHA (approaching)\n\nNight's closing.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nYes, we'll presently away.\n\nMARTHA\n\nI would entreat you longer yet to stay;\nBut 'tis a wicked place, just here about;\nIt is as if the folk had nothing else to do,\nNothing to think of too,\nBut gaping watch their neighbours, who goes in and out;\nAnd scandal's busy still, do whatsoe'er one may.\nAnd our young couple?\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nThey have flown up there.\nThe wanton butterflies!\n\nMARTHA\n\nHe seems to take to her.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nAnd she to him. 'Tis of the world the way!\n\nA SUMMER-HOUSE\n\n(MARGARET runs in, hides behind the door, holds the tip of her\nfinger to her lip, and peeps through the crevice.)\n\nMARGARET\n\nHe comes!\n\nFAUST\n\nAh, little rogue, so thou\nThink'st to provoke me! I have caught thee now!\n(He kisses her.)\n\nMARGARET\n\n(embracing him, and returning the kiss)\n\nDearest of men! I love thee from my heart!\n(MEPHISTOPHELES knocks.)\n\nWho's there?\n\nFAUST (stamping)\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nA friend!\n\nFAUST\n\nA brute!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nMARTHA (comes)\n\nAy, it is late, good sir.\n\nFAUST\n\nMayn't I attend you, then?\n\nMARGARET\n\nOh no--my mother would--adieu, adieu!\n\nFAUST\n\nAnd must I really then take leave of you? Farewell!\n\nMARTHA\n\nGood-bye!\n\nMARGARET\n\nEre long to meet again!\n\n(Exeunt FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES.)\n\nMARGARET\n\nGood heavens! how all things far and near\nMust fill his mind,--a man like this!\nAbash'd before him I appear,\nAnd say to all things only, yes.\nPoor simple child, I cannot see,\nWhat 'tis that he can find in me.\n(Exit.)\n\nFOREST AND CAVERN\n\nFAUST (alone)\n\nSpirit sublime! Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all\nFor which I prayed! Not vainly hast thou turn'd\nTo me thy countenance in flaming fire:\nGayest me glorious nature for my realm,\nAnd also power to feel her and enjoy;\nNot merely with a cold and wondering glance,\nThou dost permit me in her depths profound,\nAs in the bosom of a friend to gaze.\nBefore me thou dost lead her living tribes,\nAnd dost in silent grove, in air and stream\nTeach me to know my kindred. And when roars\nThe howling storm-blast through the groaning wood,\nWrenching the giant pine, which in its fall\nCrashing sweeps down its neighbour trunks and boughs,\nWhile hollow thunder from the hill resounds;\nThen thou dost lead me to some shelter'd cave,\nDost there reveal me to myself, and show\nOf my own bosom the mysterious depths.\nAnd when with soothing beam, the moon's pale orb\nFull in my view climbs up the pathless sky,\nFrom crag and dewy grove, the silvery forms\nOf by-gone ages hover, and assuage\nThe joy austere of contemplative thought.\n\nOh, that naught perfect is assign'd to man,\nI feel, alas! With this exalted joy,\nWhich lifts me near and nearer to the gods,\nThou gav'st me this companion, unto whom\nI needs must cling, though cold and insolent,\nHe still degrades me to myself, and turns\nThy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath.\nHe in my bosom with malicious zeal\nFor that fair image fans a raging fire;\nFrom craving to enjoyment thus I reel,\nAnd in enjoyment languish for desire. (MEPHISTOPHELES\nenters.)\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nOf this lone life have you not had your fill?\nHow for so long can it have charms for you?\n'Tis well enough to try it if you will;\nBut then away again to something new!\n\nFAUST\n\nWould you could better occupy your leisure,\nThan in disturbing thus my hours of joy.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nWell! Well! I'll leave you to yourself with pleasure,\nA serious tone you hardly dare employ.\nTo part from one so crazy, harsh, and cross,\nWere not in truth a grievous loss.\nThe live-long day, for you I toil and fret;\nNe'er from his worship's face a hint I get,\nWhat pleases him, or what to let alone.\n\nFAUST\n\nAy truly! that is just the proper tone!\nHe wearies me, and would with thanks be paid\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nPoor Son of Earth, without my aid,\nHow would thy weary days have flown?\nThee of thy foolish whims I've cured,\nThy vain imaginations banished,\nAnd but for me, be well assured,\nThou from this sphere must soon have vanished.\nIn rocky hollows and in caverns drear,\nWhy like an owl sit moping here?\nWherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued,\nDost suck, like any toad, thy food?\nA rare, sweet pastime. Verily!\nThe doctor cleaveth still to thee.\n\nFAUST\n\nDost comprehend what bliss without alloy\nFrom this wild wand'ring in the desert springs?--\nCouldst thou but guess the new life-power it brings,\nThou wouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy.\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nWhat super-earthly ecstasy! at night,\nTo lie in darkness on the dewy height,\nEmbracing heaven and earth in rapture high,\nThe soul dilating to a deity;\nWith prescient yearnings pierce the core of earth,\nFeel in your labouring breast the six-days' birth,\nEnjoy, in proud delight what no one knows,\nWhile your love-rapture o'er creation flows,--\nThe earthly lost in beatific vision,\nAnd then the lofty intuition--.\n(With a gesture.)\n\nI need not tell you how--to close!\n\nFAUST\n\nFie on you!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nThis displeases you? \"For shame!\"\nYou are forsooth entitled to exclaim;\nWe to chaste ears it seems must not pronounce\nWhat, nathless, the chaste heart cannot renounce.\nWell, to be brief, the joy as fit occasions rise,\nI grudge you not, of specious lies.\nBut long this mood thou'lt not retain.\nAlready thou'rt again outworn,\nAnd should this last, thou wilt be torn\nBy frenzy or remorse and pain.\nEnough of this! Thy true love dwells apart,\nAnd all to her seems flat and tame;\nAlone thine image fills her heart,\nShe loves thee with an all-devouring flame.\nFirst came thy passion with o'erpowering rush,\nLike mountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow;\nPull in her heart didst pour the sudden gush,\nNow has thy brookiet ceased to flow.\nInstead of sitting throned midst forests wild,\nIt would become so great a lord\nTo comfort the enamour'd child,\nAnd the young monkey for her love reward.\nTo her the hours seem miserably long;\nShe from the window sees the clouds float by\nAs o'er the lofty city-walls they fly,\n\"If I a birdie were!\" so runs her song,\nHalf through the night and all day long.\nCheerful sometimes, more oft at heart full sore;\nFairly outwept seem now her tears,\nAnon she tranquil is, or so appears,\nAnd love-sick evermore.\n\nFAUST\n\nSnake!

I oft have envied you indeed,\nThe twin-pair that among the roses feed.\n\nFAUST\n\nPander, avaunt!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nGo to! I laugh, the while you rail,\nThe power which fashion'd youth and maid,\nWell understood the noble trade;\nSo neither shall occasion fail.\nBut hence!--A mighty grief I trow!\nUnto thy lov'd one's chamber thou\nAnd not to death shouldst go.\n\nFAUST\n\nWhat is to me heaven's joy within her arms?\nWhat though my life her bosom warms!--\nDo I not ever feel her woe?\nThe outcast am I not, unhoused, unblest,\nInhuman monster, without aim or rest,\nWho, like the greedy surge, from rock to rock,\nSweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock?\nWhile she, within her lowly cot, which graced\nThe Alpine slope, beside the waters wild,\nHer homely cares in that small world embraced,\nSecluded lived, a simple, artless child.\nWas't not enough, in thy delirious whirl\nTo blast the stedfast rocks;\nHer, and her peace as well,\nMust I, God-hated one, to ruin hurl!\nDost claim this holocaust, remorseless Hell!\nFiend, help me to cut short the hours of dread!\nLet what must happen, happen speedily!\nHer direful doom fall crushing on my head,\nAnd into ruin let her plunge with me!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nWhy how again it seethes and glows!\nAway, thou fool!

I will not suffer violence!\nWith murderous hand hold not so fast!\nI have done all to please thee in the past!\n\nFAUST\n\nDay dawns! My love! My love!\n\nMARGARET\n\nYes! day draws near.\nThe day of judgment too will soon appear!\nIt should have been my bridal! No one tell,\nThat thy poor Gretchen thou hast known too well.\nWoe to my garland!\nIts bloom is o'er!\nThough not at the dance--\nWe shall meet once more.\nThe crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls;\nThe squares, the streets,\nScarce hold the throng.\nThe staff is broken,--the death-bell tolls,--\nThey bind and seize me!\nI'm hurried along,\nTo the seat of blood already I'm bound!\nQuivers each neck as the naked steel\nQuivers on mine the blow to deal--\nThe silence of the grave now broods around!\n\nFAUST\n\nWould I had never been born!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES (appears without)\n\nUp! or you're lost.\nVain hesitation! Babbling, quaking!\nMy steeds are shivering,\nMorn is breaking.\n\nMARGARET\n\nWhat from the floor ascendeth like a ghost?\n'Tis he! 'Tis he! Him from my presence chase!\nWhat would he in this holy place?\nIt is for me he cometh!\n\nFAUST\n\nThou shalt live!\n\nMARGARET\n\nJudgment of God! To thee my soul I give!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST)\n\nCome, come! With her I'll else abandon thee!\n\nMARGARET\n\nFather, I'm thine! Do thou deliver me!\nYe angels! Ye angelic hosts! descend,\nEncamp around to guard me and defend!--\nHenry! I shudder now to look on thee!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES\n\nShe now is judged!\n\nVOICES (from above)\n\nIs saved!\n\nMEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST)\n\nCome thou with me!\n(Vanishes with FAUST)\n\nVOICE (from within, dying away)\n\nHenry! Henry!\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg Etext of Faust Part 1,\nby Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe\n","id":1089,"split":"train"}
