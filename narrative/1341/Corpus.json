They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift dictionary during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.\nThe hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.\nThe narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years previously to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an \"all-permeating fluid\" called \"Vril\", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.\nMen (called An, pronounced \"Arn\") and women (called Gy-ei, pronounced \"Jy-ei\") have equal rights. The women are as strong as, if not stronger than the men. They marry for just three years, after which they are free to remarry or to remain single.\nTheir religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.\nThe narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Coming Race, by Edward Bulwer Lytton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

My ancestors\nmigrated from England in the reign of Charles II.; and my grandfather\nwas not undistinguished in the War of Independence. My family,\ntherefore, enjoyed a somewhat high social position in right of birth;\nand being also opulent, they were considered disqualified for the public\nservice. My father once ran for Congress, but was signally defeated by\nhis tailor. After that event he interfered little in politics, and lived\nmuch in his library. I was the eldest of three sons, and sent at the age\nof sixteen to the old country, partly to complete my literary education,\npartly to commence my commercial training in a mercantile firm at\nLiverpool. My father died shortly after I was twenty-one; and being left\nwell off, and having a taste for travel and adventure, I resigned, for\na time, all pursuit of the almighty dollar, and became a desultory\nwanderer over the face of the earth.\n\nIn the year 18__, happening to be in _____, I was invited by a\nprofessional engineer, with whom I had made acquaintance, to visit the\nrecesses of the ________ mine, upon which he was employed.\n\nThe reader will understand, ere he close this narrative, my reason for\nconcealing all clue to the district of which I write, and will perhaps\nthank me for refraining from any description that may tend to its\ndiscovery.\n\nLet me say, then, as briefly as possible, that I accompanied the\nengineer into the interior of the mine, and became so strangely\nfascinated by its gloomy wonders, and so interested in my friend\u0092s\nexplorations, that I prolonged my stay in the neighbourhood, and\ndescended daily, for some weeks, into the vaults and galleries hollowed\nby nature and art beneath the surface of the earth. The engineer was\npersuaded that far richer deposits of mineral wealth than had yet been\ndetected, would be found in a new shaft that had been commenced under\nhis operations. In piercing this shaft we came one day upon a chasm\njagged and seemingly charred at the sides, as if burst asunder at some\ndistant period by volcanic fires. Down this chasm my friend caused\nhimself to be lowered in a \u0091cage,\u0092 having first tested the atmosphere\nby the safety-lamp. He remained nearly an hour in the abyss. When he\nreturned he was very pale, and with an anxious, thoughtful expression\nof face, very different from its ordinary character, which was open,\ncheerful, and fearless.\n\nHe said briefly that the descent appeared to him unsafe, and leading to\nno result; and, suspending further operations in the shaft, we returned\nto the more familiar parts of the mine.\n\nAll the rest of that day the engineer seemed preoccupied by some\nabsorbing thought. He was unusually taciturn, and there was a scared,\nbewildered look in his eyes, as that of a man who has seen a ghost. At\nnight, as we two were sitting alone in the lodging we shared together\nnear the mouth of the mine, I said to my friend,--\n\n\u0093Tell me frankly what you saw in that chasm: I am sure it was something\nstrange and terrible. Whatever it be, it has left your mind in a state\nof doubt. In such a case two heads are better than one. Confide in me.\u0094\n\n\nThe engineer long endeavoured to evade my inquiries; but as, while he\nspoke, he helped himself unconsciously out of the brandy-flask to a\ndegree to which he was wholly unaccustomed, for he was a very temperate\nman, his reserve gradually melted away. He who would keep himself to\nhimself should imitate the dumb animals, and drink water. At last he\nsaid, \u0093I will tell you all. When the cage stopped, I found myself on\na ridge of rock; and below me, the chasm, taking a slanting direction,\nshot down to a considerable depth, the darkness of which my lamp could\nnot have penetrated. But through it, to my infinite surprise, streamed\nupward a steady brilliant light. Could it be any volcanic fire? In that\ncase, surely I should have felt the heat. Still, if on this there was\ndoubt, it was of the utmost importance to our common safety to clear it\nup. I examined the sides of the descent, and found that I could venture\nto trust myself to the irregular projection of ledges, at least for some\nway. I left the cage and clambered down. As I drew nearer and nearer to\nthe light, the chasm became wider, and at last I saw, to my unspeakable\namaze, a broad level road at the bottom of the abyss, illumined as far\nas the eye could reach by what seemed artificial gas-lamps placed at\nregular intervals, as in the thoroughfare of a great city; and I heard\nconfusedly at a distance a hum as of human voices. I know, of course,\nthat no rival miners are at work in this district. Whose could be those\nvoices? What human hands could have levelled that road and marshalled\nthose lamps?\n\n\u0093The superstitious belief, common to miners, that gnomes or fiends dwell\nwithin the bowels of the earth, began to seize me. I shuddered at the\nthought of descending further and braving the inhabitants of this nether\nvalley. Nor indeed could I have done so without ropes, as from the spot\nI had reached to the bottom of the chasm the sides of the rock sank down\nabrupt, smooth, and sheer. I retraced my steps with some difficulty. Now\nI have told you all.\u0094\n\n\u0093You will descend again?\u0094\n\n\u0093I ought, yet I feel as if I durst not.\u0094\n\n\u0093A trusty companion halves the journey and doubles the courage. I will\ngo with you. We will provide ourselves with ropes of suitable length and\nstrength--and--pardon me--you must not drink more to-night, our hands\nand feet must be steady and firm tomorrow.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter II.\n\n\nWith the morning my friend\u0092s nerves were rebraced, and he was not\nless excited by curiosity than myself. Perhaps more; for he evidently\nbelieved in his own story, and I felt considerable doubt of it; not that\nhe would have wilfully told an untruth, but that I thought he must have\nbeen under one of those hallucinations which seize on our fancy or our\nnerves in solitary, unaccustomed places, and in which we give shape to\nthe formless and sound to the dumb.\n\nWe selected six veteran miners to watch our descent; and as the cage\nheld only one at a time, the engineer descended first; and when he had\ngained the ledge at which he had before halted, the cage rearose for me.\nI soon gained his side. We had provided ourselves with a strong coil of\nrope.\n\nThe light struck on my sight as it had done the day before on my\nfriend\u0092s. The hollow through which it came sloped diagonally: it seemed\nto me a diffused atmospheric light, not like that from fire, but soft\nand silvery, as from a northern star. Quitting the cage, we descended,\none after the other, easily enough, owing to the juts in the side, till\nwe reached the place at which my friend had previously halted, and which\nwas a projection just spacious enough to allow us to stand abreast. From\nthis spot the chasm widened rapidly like the lower end of a vast funnel,\nand I saw distinctly the valley, the road, the lamps which my companion\nhad described. He had exaggerated nothing. I heard the sounds he had\nheard--a mingled indescribable hum as of voices and a dull tramp as of\nfeet. Straining my eye farther down, I clearly beheld at a distance the\noutline of some large building. It could not be mere natural rock, it\nwas too symmetrical, with huge heavy Egyptian-like columns, and the\nwhole lighted as from within. I had about me a small pocket-telescope,\nand by the aid of this, I could distinguish, near the building I\nmention, two forms which seemed human, though I could not be sure. At\nleast they were living, for they moved, and both vanished within the\nbuilding. We now proceeded to attach the end of the rope we had brought\nwith us to the ledge on which we stood, by the aid of clamps and\ngrappling hooks, with which, as well as with necessary tools, we were\nprovided.\n\nWe were almost silent in our work. We toiled like men afraid to speak to\neach other. One end of the rope being thus apparently made firm to the\nledge, the other, to which we fastened a fragment of the rock, rested on\nthe ground below, a distance of some fifty feet. I was a younger man and\na more active man than my companion, and having served on board ship in\nmy boyhood, this mode of transit was more familiar to me than to him. In\na whisper I claimed the precedence, so that when I gained the ground I\nmight serve to hold the rope more steady for his descent. I got safely\nto the ground beneath, and the engineer now began to lower himself.\nBut he had scarcely accomplished ten feet of the descent, when the\nfastenings, which we had fancied so secure, gave way, or rather the\nrock itself proved treacherous and crumbled beneath the strain; and the\nunhappy man was precipitated to the bottom, falling just at my feet,\nand bringing down with his fall splinters of the rock, one of which,\nfortunately but a small one, struck and for the time stunned me. When I\nrecovered my senses I saw my companion an inanimate mass beside me,\nlife utterly extinct. While I was bending over his corpse in grief and\nhorror, I heard close at hand a strange sound between a snort and a\nhiss; and turning instinctively to the quarter from which it came, I saw\nemerging from a dark fissure in the rock a vast and terrible head,\nwith open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes--the head of a monstrous\nreptile resembling that of the crocodile or alligator, but infinitely\nlarger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever beheld in my\ntravels. I started to my feet and fled down the valley at my utmost\nspeed. I stopped at last, ashamed of my panic and my flight, and\nreturned to the spot on which I had left the body of my friend. It\nwas gone; doubtless the monster had already drawn it into its den and\ndevoured it. The rope and the grappling-hooks still lay where they had\nfallen, but they afforded me no chance of return; it was impossible to\nre-attach them to the rock above, and the sides of the rock were too\nsheer and smooth for human steps to clamber. I was alone in this strange\nworld, amidst the bowels of the earth.\n\n\n\nChapter III.\n\n\nSlowly and cautiously I went my solitary way down the lamplit road and\ntowards the large building I have described. The road itself seemed like\na great Alpine pass, skirting rocky mountains of which the one through\nwhose chasm I had descended formed a link. Deep below to the left lay\na vast valley, which presented to my astonished eye the unmistakeable\nevidences of art and culture. There were fields covered with a strange\nvegetation, similar to none I have seen above the earth; the colour of\nit not green, but rather of a dull and leaden hue or of a golden red.\n\nThere were lakes and rivulets which seemed to have been curved into\nartificial banks; some of pure water, others that shone like pools of\nnaphtha. At my right hand, ravines and defiles opened amidst the rocks,\nwith passes between, evidently constructed by art, and bordered by trees\nresembling, for the most part, gigantic ferns, with exquisite varieties\nof feathery foliage, and stems like those of the palm-tree. Others were\nmore like the cane-plant, but taller, bearing large clusters of flowers.\nOthers, again, had the form of enormous fungi, with short thick stems\nsupporting a wide dome-like roof, from which either rose or drooped long\nslender branches. The whole scene behind, before, and beside me far as\nthe eye could reach, was brilliant with innumerable lamps. The world\nwithout a sun was bright and warm as an Italian landscape at noon, but\nthe air less oppressive, the heat softer. Nor was the scene before me\nvoid of signs of habitation. I could distinguish at a distance, whether\non the banks of the lake or rivulet, or half-way upon eminences,\nembedded amidst the vegetation, buildings that must surely be the homes\nof men. I could even discover, though far off, forms that appeared to\nme human moving amidst the landscape. As I paused to gaze, I saw to\nthe right, gliding quickly through the air, what appeared a small\nboat, impelled by sails shaped like wings. It soon passed out of sight,\ndescending amidst the shades of a forest. Right above me there was no\nsky, but only a cavernous roof. This roof grew higher and higher at the\ndistance of the landscapes beyond, till it became imperceptible, as an\natmosphere of haze formed itself beneath.\n\nContinuing my walk, I started,--from a bush that resembled a great\ntangle of sea-weeds, interspersed with fern-like shrubs and plants of\nlarge leafage shaped like that of the aloe or prickly-pear,--a curious\nanimal about the size and shape of a deer. But as, after bounding away\na few paces, it turned round and gazed at me inquisitively, I perceived\nthat it was not like any species of deer now extant above the earth,\nbut it brought instantly to my recollection a plaster cast I had seen\nin some museum of a variety of the elk stag, said to have existed before\nthe Deluge. The creature seemed tame enough, and, after inspecting me a\nmoment or two, began to graze on the singular herbiage around undismayed\nand careless.\n\n\n\nChapter IV.\n\n\nI now came in full sight of the building. Yes, it had been made by\nhands, and hollowed partly out of a great rock. I should have supposed\nit at the first glance to have been of the earliest form of Egyptian\narchitecture. It was fronted by huge columns, tapering upward from\nmassive plinths, and with capitals that, as I came nearer, I perceived\nto be more ornamental and more fantastically graceful that Egyptian\narchitecture allows. As the Corinthian capital mimics the leaf of the\nacanthus, so the capitals of these columns imitated the foliage of the\nvegetation neighbouring them, some aloe-like, some fern-like. And now\nthere came out of this building a form--human;--was it human? It stood\non the broad way and looked around, beheld me and approached. It\ncame within a few yards of me, and at the sight and presence of it an\nindescribable awe and tremor seized me, rooting my feet to the ground.\nIt reminded me of symbolical images of Genius or Demon that are seen on\nEtruscan vases or limned on the walls of Eastern sepulchres--images that\nborrow the outlines of man, and are yet of another race. It was tall,\nnot gigantic, but tall as the tallest man below the height of giants.\n\nIts chief covering seemed to me to be composed of large wings folded\nover its breast and reaching to its knees; the rest of its attire was\ncomposed of an under tunic and leggings of some thin fibrous material.\nIt wore on its head a kind of tiara that shone with jewels, and carried\nin its right hand a slender staff of bright metal like polished steel.\nBut the face! it was that which inspired my awe and my terror. It was\nthe face of man, but yet of a type of man distinct from our known extant\nraces. The nearest approach to it in outline and expression is the\nface of the sculptured sphinx--so regular in its calm, intellectual,\nmysterious beauty. Its colour was peculiar, more like that of the red\nman than any other variety of our species, and yet different from it--a\nricher and a softer hue, with large black eyes, deep and brilliant, and\nbrows arched as a semicircle. The face was beardless; but a nameless\nsomething in the aspect, tranquil though the expression, and beauteous\nthough the features, roused that instinct of danger which the sight of\na tiger or serpent arouses. I felt that this manlike image was endowed\nwith forces inimical to man. As it drew near, a cold shudder came over\nme. I fell on my knees and covered my face with my hands.\n\n\n\nChapter V.\n\n\nA voice accosted me--a very quiet and very musical key of voice--in a\nlanguage of which I could not understand a word, but it served to\ndispel my fear. I uncovered my face and looked up. The stranger (I could\nscarcely bring myself to call him man) surveyed me with an eye that\nseemed to read to the very depths of my heart. He then placed his left\nhand on my forehead, and with the staff in his right, gently touched my\nshoulder. The effect of this double contact was magical. In place of my\nformer terror there passed into me a sense of contentment, of joy, of\nconfidence in myself and in the being before me. I rose and spoke in\nmy own language. He listened to me with apparent attention, but with a\nslight surprise in his looks; and shook his head, as if to signify that\nI was not understood. He then took me by the hand and led me in silence\nto the building. The entrance was open--indeed there was no door to it.\nWe entered an immense hall, lighted by the same kind of lustre as in the\nscene without, but diffusing a fragrant odour. The floor was in large\ntesselated blocks of precious metals, and partly covered with a sort of\nmatlike carpeting. A strain of low music, above and around, undulated as\nif from invisible instruments, seeming to belong naturally to the place,\njust as the sound of murmuring waters belongs to a rocky landscape, or\nthe warble of birds to vernal groves.\n\nA figure in a simpler garb than that of my guide, but of similar\nfashion, was standing motionless near the threshold. My guide touched\nit twice with his staff, and it put itself into a rapid and gliding\nmovement, skimming noiselessly over the floor. Gazing on it, I then saw\nthat it was no living form, but a mechanical automaton. It might be two\nminutes after it vanished through a doorless opening, half screened by\ncurtains at the other end of the hall, when through the same opening\nadvanced a boy of about twelve years old, with features closely\nresembling those of my guide, so that they seemed to me evidently son\nand father. On seeing me the child uttered a cry, and lifted a staff\nlike that borne by my guide, as if in menace. At a word from the elder\nhe dropped it. The two then conversed for some moments, examining me\nwhile they spoke. The child touched my garments, and stroked my face\nwith evident curiosity, uttering a sound like a laugh, but with an\nhilarity more subdued that the mirth of our laughter. Presently the roof\nof the hall opened, and a platform descended, seemingly constructed\non the same principle as the \u0091lifts\u0092 used in hotels and warehouses for\nmounting from one story to another.\n\nThe stranger placed himself and the child on the platform, and motioned\nto me to do the same, which I did. We ascended quickly and safely, and\nalighted in the midst of a corridor with doorways on either side.\n\nThrough one of these doorways I was conducted into a chamber fitted up\nwith an oriental splendour; the walls were tesselated with spars, and\nmetals, and uncut jewels; cushions and divans abounded; apertures as for\nwindows but unglazed, were made in the chamber opening to the floor;\nand as I passed along I observed that these openings led into spacious\nbalconies, and commanded views of the illumined landscape without. In\ncages suspended from the ceiling there were birds of strange form and\nbright plumage, which at our entrance set up a chorus of song, modulated\ninto tune as is that of our piping bullfinches. A delicious fragrance,\nfrom censers of gold elaborately sculptured, filled the air. Several\nautomata, like the one I had seen, stood dumb and motionless by the\nwalls. The stranger placed me beside him on a divan and again spoke\nto me, and again I spoke, but without the least advance towards\nunderstanding each other.\n\nBut now I began to feel the effects of the blow I had received from the\nsplinters of the falling rock more acutely that I had done at first.\n\nThere came over me a sense of sickly faintness, accompanied with acute,\nlancinating pains in the head and neck. I sank back on the seat and\nstrove in vain to stifle a groan. On this the child, who had hitherto\nseemed to eye me with distrust or dislike, knelt by my side to support\nme; taking one of my hands in both his own, he approached his lips to\nmy forehead, breathing on it softly. In a few moments my pain ceased; a\ndrowsy, heavy calm crept over me; I fell asleep.\n\nHow long I remained in this state I know not, but when I woke I felt\nperfectly restored. My eyes opened upon a group of silent forms, seated\naround me in the gravity and quietude of Orientals--all more or less\nlike the first stranger; the same mantling wings, the same fashion of\ngarment, the same sphinx-like faces, with the deep dark eyes and red\nman\u0092s colour; above all, the same type of race--race akin to man\u0092s, but\ninfinitely stronger of form and grandeur of aspect--and inspiring the\nsame unutterable feeling of dread. Yet each countenance was mild and\ntranquil, and even kindly in expression. And, strangely enough, it\nseemed to me that in this very calm and benignity consisted the secret\nof the dread which the countenances inspired. They seemed as void of the\nlines and shadows which care and sorrow, and passion and sin, leave upon\nthe faces of men, as are the faces of sculptured gods, or as, in the\neyes of Christian mourners, seem the peaceful brows of the dead.\n\nI felt a warm hand on my shoulder; it was the child\u0092s. In his eyes there\nwas a sort of lofty pity and tenderness, such as that with which we may\ngaze on some suffering bird or butterfly. I shrank from that touch--I\nshrank from that eye. I was vaguely impressed with a belief that, had he\nso pleased, that child could have killed me as easily as a man can kill\na bird or a butterfly. The child seemed pained at my repugnance, quitted\nme, and placed himself beside one of the windows. The others continued\nto converse with each other in a low tone, and by their glances towards\nme I could perceive that I was the object of their conversation. One\nin especial seemed to be urging some proposal affecting me on the being\nwhom I had first met, and this last by his gesture seemed about to\nassent to it, when the child suddenly quitted his post by the window,\nplaced himself between me and the other forms, as if in protection, and\nspoke quickly and eagerly. By some intuition or instinct I felt that\nthe child I had before so dreaded was pleading in my behalf. Ere he had\nceased another stranger entered the room. He appeared older than the\nrest, though not old; his countenance less smoothly serene than theirs,\nthough equally regular in its features, seemed to me to have more the\ntouch of a humanity akin to my own. He listened quietly to the words\naddressed to him, first by my guide, next by two others of the group,\nand lastly by the child; then turned towards myself, and addressed\nme, not by words, but by signs and gestures. These I fancied that I\nperfectly understood, and I was not mistaken. I comprehended that he\ninquired whence I came. I extended my arm, and pointed towards the road\nwhich had led me from the chasm in the rock; then an idea seized me.\nI drew forth my pocket-book, and sketched on one of its blank leaves a\nrough design of the ledge of the rock, the rope, myself clinging to it;\nthen of the cavernous rock below, the head of the reptile, the lifeless\nform of my friend. I gave this primitive kind of hieroglyph to my\ninterrogator, who, after inspecting it gravely, handed it to his next\nneighbour, and it thus passed round the group. The being I had at first\nencountered then said a few words, and the child, who approached and\nlooked at my drawing, nodded as if he comprehended its purport, and,\nreturning to the window, expanded the wings attached to his form, shook\nthem once or twice, and then launched himself into space without. I\nstarted up in amaze and hastened to the window. The child was already in\nthe air, buoyed on his wings, which he did not flap to and fro as a\nbird does, but which were elevated over his head, and seemed to bear him\nsteadily aloft without effort of his own. His flight seemed as swift\nas an eagle\u0092s; and I observed that it was towards the rock whence I\nhad descended, of which the outline loomed visible in the brilliant\natmosphere. In a very few minutes he returned, skimming through the\nopening from which he had gone, and dropping on the floor the rope and\ngrappling-hooks I had left at the descent from the chasm. Some words in\na low tone passed between the being present; one of the group touched an\nautomaton, which started forward and glided from the room; then the last\ncomer, who had addressed me by gestures, rose, took me by the hand,\nand led me into the corridor. There the platform by which I had mounted\nawaited us; we placed ourselves on it and were lowered into the hall\nbelow. My new companion, still holding me by the hand, conducted me from\nthe building into a street (so to speak) that stretched beyond it, with\nbuildings on either side, separated from each other by gardens bright\nwith rich-coloured vegetation and strange flowers. Interspersed amidst\nthese gardens, which were divided from each other by low walls, or\nwalking slowly along the road, were many forms similar to those I had\nalready seen. Some of the passers-by, on observing me, approached my\nguide, evidently by their tones, looks, and gestures addressing to him\ninquiries about myself. In a few moments a crowd collected around us,\nexamining me with great interest, as if I were some rare wild animal.\nYet even in gratifying their curiosity they preserved a grave and\ncourteous demeanour; and after a few words from my guide, who seemed to\nme to deprecate obstruction in our road, they fell back with a\nstately inclination of head, and resumed their own way with tranquil\nindifference. Midway in this thoroughfare we stopped at a building that\ndiffered from those we had hitherto passed, inasmuch as it formed three\nsides of a vast court, at the angles of which were lofty pyramidal\ntowers; in the open space between the sides was a circular fountain of\ncolossal dimensions, and throwing up a dazzling spray of what seemed to\nme fire. We entered the building through an open doorway and came\ninto an enormous hall, in which were several groups of children, all\napparently employed in work as at some great factory. There was a huge\nengine in the wall which was in full play, with wheels and cylinders\nresembling our own steam-engines, except that it was richly ornamented\nwith precious stones and metals, and appeared to emanate a pale\nphosphorescent atmosphere of shifting light. Many of the children were\nat some mysterious work on this machinery, others were seated before\ntables. I was not allowed to linger long enough to examine into the\nnature of their employment. Not one young voice was heard--not one young\nface turned to gaze on us. They were all still and indifferent as may\nbe ghosts, through the midst of which pass unnoticed the forms of the\nliving.\n\nQuitting this hall, my guide led me through a gallery richly painted\nin compartments, with a barbaric mixture of gold in the colours,\nlike pictures by Louis Cranach. The subjects described on these walls\nappeared to my glance as intended to illustrate events in the history of\nthe race amidst which I was admitted. In all there were figures, most\nof them like the manlike creatures I had seen, but not all in the same\nfashion of garb, nor all with wings. There were also the effigies\nof various animals and birds, wholly strange to me, with backgrounds\ndepicting landscapes or buildings. So far as my imperfect knowledge of\nthe pictorial art would allow me to form an opinion, these paintings\nseemed very accurate in design and very rich in colouring, showing\na perfect knowledge of perspective, but their details not\narranged according to the rules of composition acknowledged by our\nartists--wanting, as it were, a centre; so that the effect was vague,\nscattered, confused, bewildering--they were like heterogeneous fragments\nof a dream of art.\n\nWe now came into a room of moderate size, in which was assembled what I\nafterwards knew to be the family of my guide, seated at a table spread\nas for repast. The forms thus grouped were those of my guide\u0092s wife, his\ndaughter, and two sons. I recognised at once the difference between\nthe two sexes, though the two females were of taller stature and ampler\nproportions than the males; and their countenances, if still more\nsymmetrical in outline and contour, were devoid of the softness and\ntimidity of expression which give charm to the face of woman as seen on\nthe earth above. The wife wore no wings, the daughter wore wings longer\nthan those of the males.\n\nMy guide uttered a few words, on which all the persons seated rose,\nand with that peculiar mildness of look and manner which I have before\nnoticed, and which is, in truth, the common attribute of this formidable\nrace, they saluted me according to their fashion, which consists in\nlaying the right hand very gently on the head and uttering a soft\nsibilant monosyllable--S.Si, equivalent to \u0093Welcome.\u0094\n\nThe mistress of the house then seated me beside her, and heaped a golden\nplatter before me from one of the dishes.\n\nWhile I ate (and though the viands were new to me, I marvelled more\nat the delicacy than the strangeness of their flavour), my companions\nconversed quietly, and, so far as I could detect, with polite avoidance\nof any direct reference to myself, or any obtrusive scrutiny of my\nappearance. Yet I was the first creature of that variety of the human\nrace to which I belong that they had ever beheld, and was consequently\nregarded by them as a most curious and abnormal phenomenon. But all\nrudeness is unknown to this people, and the youngest child is taught to\ndespise any vehement emotional demonstration. When the meal was ended,\nmy guide again took me by the hand, and, re-entering the gallery,\ntouched a metallic plate inscribed with strange figures, and which I\nrightly conjectured to be of the nature of our telegraphs. A platform\ndescended, but this time we mounted to a much greater height than in the\nformer building, and found ourselves in a room of moderate dimensions,\nand which in its general character had much that might be familiar to\nthe associations of a visitor from the upper world. There were shelves\non the wall containing what appeared to be books, and indeed were so;\nmostly very small, like our diamond duodecimos, shaped in the fashion\nof our volumes, and bound in sheets of fine metal. There were several\ncurious-looking pieces of mechanism scattered about, apparently models,\nsuch as might be seen in the study of any professional mechanician. Four\nautomata (mechanical contrivances which, with these people, answer the\nordinary purposes of domestic service) stood phantom-like at each angle\nin the wall. In a recess was a low couch, or bed with pillows. A window,\nwith curtains of some fibrous material drawn aside, opened upon a large\nbalcony. My host stepped out into the balcony; I followed him. We were\non the uppermost story of one of the angular pyramids; the view beyond\nwas of a wild and solemn beauty impossible to describe:--the vast\nranges of precipitous rock which formed the distant background, the\nintermediate valleys of mystic many-coloured herbiage, the flash of\nwaters, many of them like streams of roseate flame, the serene lustre\ndiffused over all by myriads of lamps, combined to form a whole of which\nno words of mine can convey adequate description; so splendid was it,\nyet so sombre; so lovely, yet so awful.\n\nBut my attention was soon diverted from these nether landscapes.\nSuddenly there arose, as from the streets below, a burst of joyous\nmusic; then a winged form soared into the space; another as if in chase\nof the first, another and another; others after others, till the crowd\ngrew thick and the number countless. But how describe the fantastic\ngrace of these forms in their undulating movements! They appeared\nengaged in some sport or amusement; now forming into opposite squadrons;\nnow scattering; now each group threading the other, soaring, descending,\ninterweaving, severing; all in measured time to the music below, as if\nin the dance of the fabled Peri.\n\nI turned my gaze on my host in a feverish wonder. I ventured to place my\nhand on the large wings that lay folded on his breast, and in doing so a\nslight shock as of electricity passed through me. I recoiled in fear;\nmy host smiled, and as if courteously to gratify my curiosity, slowly\nexpanded his pinions. I observed that his garment beneath them became\ndilated as a bladder that fills with air. The arms seemed to slide\ninto the wings, and in another moment he had launched himself into the\nluminous atmosphere, and hovered there, still, and with outspread wings,\nas an eagle that basks in the sun. Then, rapidly as an eagle swoops, he\nrushed downwards into the midst of one of the groups, skimming through\nthe midst, and as suddenly again soaring aloft. Thereon, three forms,\nin one of which I thought to recognise my host\u0092s daughter, detached\nthemselves from the rest, and followed him as a bird sportively follows\na bird. My eyes, dazzled with the lights and bewildered by the throngs,\nceased to distinguish the gyrations and evolutions of these winged\nplaymates, till presently my host re-emerged from the crowd and alighted\nat my side.\n\nThe strangeness of all I had seen began now to operate fast on my\nsenses; my mind itself began to wander. Though not inclined to be\nsuperstitious, nor hitherto believing that man could be brought into\nbodily communication with demons, I felt the terror and the wild\nexcitement with which, in the Gothic ages, a traveller might have\npersuaded himself that he witnessed a \u0091sabbat\u0092 of fiends and witches.\nI have a vague recollection of having attempted with vehement\ngesticulation, and forms of exorcism, and loud incoherent words, to\nrepel my courteous and indulgent host; of his mild endeavors to calm and\nsoothe me; of his intelligent conjecture that my fright and bewilderment\nwere occasioned by the difference of form and movement between us which\nthe wings that had excited my marvelling curiosity had, in exercise,\nmade still more strongly perceptible; of the gentle smile with which he\nhad sought to dispel my alarm by dropping the wings to the ground and\nendeavouring to show me that they were but a mechanical contrivance.\nThat sudden transformation did but increase my horror, and as extreme\nfright often shows itself by extreme daring, I sprang at his throat like\na wild beast. On an instant I was felled to the ground as by an electric\nshock, and the last confused images floating before my sight ere I\nbecame wholly insensible, were the form of my host kneeling beside\nme with one hand on my forehead, and the beautiful calm face of his\ndaughter, with large, deep, inscrutable eyes intently fixed upon my own.\n\n\n\nChapter VI.\n\n\nI remained in this unconscious state, as I afterwards learned, for many\ndays, even for some weeks according to our computation of time. When\nI recovered I was in a strange room, my host and all his family were\ngathered round me, and to my utter amaze my host\u0092s daughter accosted me\nin my own language with a slightly foreign accent.\n\n\u0093How do you feel?\u0094 she asked.\n\nIt was some moments before I could overcome my surprise enough to falter\nout, \u0093You know my language? How? Who and what are you?\u0094\n\nMy host smiled and motioned to one of his sons, who then took from a\ntable a number of thin metallic sheets on which were traced drawings of\nvarious figures--a house, a tree, a bird, a man, &c.\n\nIn these designs I recognised my own style of drawing. Under each figure\nwas written the name of it in my language, and in my writing; and in\nanother handwriting a word strange to me beneath it.\n\nSaid the host, \u0093Thus we began; and my daughter Zee, who belongs to the\nCollege of Sages, has been your instructress and ours too.\u0094\n\nZee then placed before me other metallic sheets, on which, in my\nwriting, words first, and then sentences, were inscribed. Under each\nword and each sentence strange characters in another hand. Rallying my\nsenses, I comprehended that thus a rude dictionary had been effected.\nHad it been done while I was dreaming? \u0093That is enough now,\u0094 said Zee,\nin a tone of command. \u0093Repose and take food.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter VII.\n\n\nA room to myself was assigned to me in this vast edifice. It was\nprettily and fantastically arranged, but without any of the splendour\nof metal-work or gems which was displayed in the more public apartments.\nThe walls were hung with a variegated matting made from the stalks and\nfibers of plants, and the floor carpeted with the same.\n\nThe bed was without curtains, its supports of iron resting on balls of\ncrystal; the coverings, of a thin white substance resembling cotton.\nThere were sundry shelves containing books. A curtained recess\ncommunicated with an aviary filled with singing-birds, of which I\ndid not recognise one resembling those I have seen on earth, except a\nbeautiful species of dove, though this was distinguished from our doves\nby a tall crest of bluish plumes. All these birds had been trained\nto sing in artful tunes, and greatly exceeded the skill of our piping\nbullfinches, which can rarely achieve more than two tunes, and cannot, I\nbelieve, sing those in concert. One might have supposed one\u0092s self at\nan opera in listening to the voices in my aviary. There were duets\nand trios, and quartetts and choruses, all arranged as in one piece of\nmusic. Did I want silence from the birds? I had but to draw a curtain\nover the aviary, and their song hushed as they found themselves left in\nthe dark. Another opening formed a window, not glazed, but on touching a\nspring, a shutter ascended from the floor, formed of some substance\nless transparent than glass, but still sufficiently pellucid to allow\na softened view of the scene without. To this window was attached a\nbalcony, or rather hanging garden, wherein grew many graceful plants\nand brilliant flowers. The apartment and its appurtenances had thus a\ncharacter, if strange in detail, still familiar, as a whole, to modern\nnotions of luxury, and would have excited admiration if found attached\nto the apartments of an English duchess or a fashionable French author.\nBefore I arrived this was Zee\u0092s chamber; she had hospitably assigned it\nto me.\n\nSome hours after the waking up which is described in my last chapter, I\nwas lying alone on my couch trying to fix my thoughts on conjecture as\nto the nature and genus of the people amongst whom I was thrown, when my\nhost and his daughter Zee entered the room. My host, still speaking\nmy native language, inquired with much politeness, whether it would be\nagreeable to me to converse, or if I preferred solitude. I replied, that\nI should feel much honoured and obliged by the opportunity offered me to\nexpress my gratitude for the hospitality and civilities I had received\nin a country to which I was a stranger, and to learn enough of its\ncustoms and manners not to offend through ignorance.\n\nAs I spoke, I had of course risen from my couch: but Zee, much to my\nconfusion, curtly ordered me to lie down again, and there was something\nin her voice and eye, gentle as both were, that compelled my obedience.\nShe then seated herself unconcernedly at the foot of my bed, while her\nfather took his place on a divan a few feet distant.\n\n\u0093But what part of the world do you come from?\u0094 asked my host, \u0093that we\nshould appear so strange to you and you to us? I have seen individual\nspecimens of nearly all the races differing from our own, except the\nprimeval savages who dwell in the most desolate and remote recesses of\nuncultivated nature, unacquainted with other light than that they obtain\nfrom volcanic fires, and contented to grope their way in the dark, as do\nmany creeping, crawling and flying things. But certainly you cannot be a\nmember of those barbarous tribes, nor, on the other hand, do you seem to\nbelong to any civilised people.\u0094\n\nI was somewhat nettled at this last observation, and replied that I had\nthe honour to belong to one of the most civilised nations of the earth;\nand that, so far as light was concerned, while I admired the ingenuity\nand disregard of expense with which my host and his fellow-citizens had\ncontrived to illumine the regions unpenetrated by the rays of the sun,\nyet I could not conceive how any who had once beheld the orbs of heaven\ncould compare to their lustre the artificial lights invented by the\nnecessities of man. But my host said he had seen specimens of most of\nthe races differing from his own, save the wretched barbarians he had\nmentioned. Now, was it possible that he had never been on the surface\nof the earth, or could he only be referring to communities buried within\nits entrails?\n\nMy host was for some moments silent; his countenance showed a degree of\nsurprise which the people of that race very rarely manifest under any\ncircumstances, howsoever extraordinary. But Zee was more intelligent,\nand exclaimed, \u0093So you see, my father, that there is truth in the old\ntradition; there always is truth in every tradition commonly believed in\nall times and by all tribes.\u0094\n\n\u0093Zee,\u0094 said my host mildly, \u0093you belong to the College of Sages, and\nought to be wiser than I am; but, as chief of the Light-preserving\nCouncil, it is my duty to take nothing for granted till it is proved to\nthe evidence of my own senses.\u0094 Then, turning to me, he asked me several\nquestions about the surface of the earth and the heavenly bodies; upon\nwhich, though I answered him to the best of my knowledge, my answers\nseemed not to satisfy nor convince him. He shook his head quietly, and,\nchanging the subject rather abruptly, asked how I had come down from\nwhat he was pleased to call one world to the other. I answered, that\nunder the surface of the earth there were mines containing minerals,\nor metals, essential to our wants and our progress in all arts and\nindustries; and I then briefly explained the manner in which, while\nexploring one of those mines, I and my ill-fated friend had obtained a\nglimpse of the regions into which we had descended, and how the descent\nhad cost him his life; appealing to the rope and grappling-hooks\nthat the child had brought to the house in which I had been at first\nreceived, as a witness of the truthfulness of my story.\n\nMy host then proceeded to question me as to the habits and modes of\nlife among the races on the upper earth, more especially among those\nconsidered to be the most advanced in that civilisation which he was\npleased to define \u0093the art of diffusing throughout a community the\ntranquil happiness which belongs to a virtuous and well-ordered\nhousehold.\u0094 Naturally desiring to represent in the most favourable\ncolours the world from which I came, I touched but slightly, though\nindulgently, on the antiquated and decaying institutions of Europe, in\norder to expatiate on the present grandeur and prospective pre-eminence\nof that glorious American Republic, in which Europe enviously seeks its\nmodel and tremblingly foresees its doom. Selecting for an example of the\nsocial life of the United States that city in which progress advances\nat the fastest rate, I indulged in an animated description of the moral\nhabits of New York. Mortified to see, by the faces of my listeners, that\nI did not make the favourable impression I had anticipated, I elevated\nmy theme; dwelling on the excellence of democratic institutions, their\npromotion of tranquil happiness by the government of party, and the\nmode in which they diffused such happiness throughout the community by\npreferring, for the exercise of power and the acquisition of honours,\nthe lowliest citizens in point of property, education, and character.\nFortunately recollecting the peroration of a speech, on the purifying\ninfluences of American democracy and their destined spread over the\nworld, made by a certain eloquent senator (for whose vote in the Senate\na Railway Company, to which my two brothers belonged, had just paid\n20,000 dollars), I wound up by repeating its glowing predictions of the\nmagnificent future that smiled upon mankind--when the flag of freedom\nshould float over an entire continent, and two hundred millions of\nintelligent citizens, accustomed from infancy to the daily use of\nrevolvers, should apply to a cowering universe the doctrine of the\nPatriot Monroe.\n\nWhen I had concluded, my host gently shook his head, and fell into a\nmusing study, making a sign to me and his daughter to remain silent\nwhile he reflected. And after a time he said, in a very earnest and\nsolemn tone, \u0093If you think as you say, that you, though a stranger, have\nreceived kindness at the hands of me and mine, I adjure you to reveal\nnothing to any other of our people respecting the world from which you\ncame, unless, on consideration, I give you permission to do so. Do you\nconsent to this request?\u0094 \u0093Of course I pledge my word, to it,\u0094 said\nI, somewhat amazed; and I extended my right hand to grasp his. But\nhe placed my hand gently on his forehead and his own right hand on my\nbreast, which is the custom amongst this race in all matters of promise\nor verbal obligations. Then turning to his daughter, he said, \u0093And you,\nZee, will not repeat to any one what the stranger has said, or may say,\nto me or to you, of a world other than our own.\u0094 Zee rose and kissed her\nfather on the temples, saying, with a smile, \u0093A Gy\u0092s tongue is wanton,\nbut love can fetter it fast. And if, my father, you fear lest a chance\nword from me or yourself could expose our community to danger, by a\ndesire to explore a world beyond us, will not a wave of the \u0091vril,\u0092\nproperly impelled, wash even the memory of what we have heard the\nstranger say out of the tablets of the brain?\u0094\n\n\u0093What is the vril?\u0094 I asked.\n\nTherewith Zee began to enter into an explanation of which I understood\nvery little, for there is no word in any language I know which is an\nexact synonym for vril. I should call it electricity, except that it\ncomprehends in its manifold branches other forces of nature, to which,\nin our scientific nomenclature, differing names are assigned, such as\nmagnetism, galvanism, &c. These people consider that in vril they have\narrived at the unity in natural energetic agencies, which has been\nconjectured by many philosophers above ground, and which Faraday thus\nintimates under the more cautious term of correlation:--\n\n\u0093I have long held an opinion,\u0094 says that illustrious experimentalist,\n\u0093almost amounting to a conviction, in common, I believe, with many other\nlovers of natural knowledge, that the various forms under which the\nforces of matter are made manifest, have one common origin; or, in other\nwords, are so directly related and mutually dependent that they are\nconvertible, as it were into one another, and possess equivalents of\npower in their action.\u0094\n\nThese subterranean philosophers assert that by one operation of vril,\nwhich Faraday would perhaps call \u0091atmospheric magnetism,\u0092 they can\ninfluence the variations of temperature--in plain words, the weather;\nthat by operations, akin to those ascribed to mesmerism, electro-\nbiology, odic force, &c., but applied scientifically, through vril\nconductors, they can exercise influence over minds, and bodies animal\nand vegetable, to an extent not surpassed in the romances of our\nmystics. To all such agencies they give the common name of vril.\u0094\n\nZee asked me if, in my world, it was not known that all the faculties of\nthe mind could be quickened to a degree unknown in the waking state,\nby trance or vision, in which the thoughts of one brain could be\ntransmitted to another, and knowledge be thus rapidly interchanged.\nI replied, that there were amongst us stories told of such trance\nor vision, and that I had heard much and seen something in mesmeric\nclairvoyance; but that these practices had fallen much into disuse or\ncontempt, partly because of the gross impostures to which they had\nbeen made subservient, and partly because, even where the effects upon\ncertain abnormal constitutions were genuinely produced, the effects when\nfairly examined and analysed, were very unsatisfactory--not to be relied\nupon for any systematic truthfulness or any practical purpose, and\nrendered very mischievous to credulous persons by the superstitions\nthey tended to produce. Zee received my answers with much benignant\nattention, and said that similar instances of abuse and credulity had\nbeen familiar to their own scientific experience in the infancy of their\nknowledge, and while the properties of vril were misapprehended, but\nthat she reserved further discussion on this subject till I was more\nfitted to enter into it. She contented herself with adding, that it\nwas through the agency of vril, while I had been placed in the state\nof trance, that I had been made acquainted with the rudiments of their\nlanguage; and that she and her father, who alone of the family, took\nthe pains to watch the experiment, had acquired a greater proportionate\nknowledge of my language than I of their own; partly because my language\nwas much simpler than theirs, comprising far less of complex ideas; and\npartly because their organisation was, by hereditary culture, much more\nductile and more readily capable of acquiring knowledge than mine. At\nthis I secretly demurred; and having had in the course of a practical\nlife, to sharpen my wits, whether at home or in travel, I could not\nallow that my cerebral organisation could possibly be duller than that\nof people who had lived all their lives by lamplight. However, while I\nwas thus thinking, Zee quietly pointed her forefinger at my forehead,\nand sent me to sleep.\n\n\n\nChapter VIII.\n\n\nWhen I once more awoke I saw by my bed-side the child who had brought\nthe rope and grappling-hooks to the house in which I had been first\nreceived, and which, as I afterwards learned, was the residence of\nthe chief magistrate of the tribe. The child, whose name was Taee\n(pronounced Tar-ee), was the magistrate\u0092s eldest son. I found that\nduring my last sleep or trance I had made still greater advance in the\nlanguage of the country, and could converse with comparative ease and\nfluency.\n\nThis child was singularly handsome, even for the beautiful race to which\nhe belonged, with a countenance very manly in aspect for his years, and\nwith a more vivacious and energetic expression than I had hitherto seen\nin the serene and passionless faces of the men. He brought me the tablet\non which I had drawn the mode of my descent, and had also sketched the\nhead of the horrible reptile that had scared me from my friend\u0092s corpse.\nPointing to that part of the drawing, Taee put to me a few questions\nrespecting the size and form of the monster, and the cave or chasm from\nwhich it had emerged. His interest in my answers seemed so grave as\nto divert him for a while from any curiosity as to myself or my\nantecedents. But to my great embarrassment, seeing how I was pledged to\nmy host, he was just beginning to ask me where I came from, when Zee,\nfortunately entered, and, overhearing him, said, \u0093Taee, give to our\nguest any information he may desire, but ask none from him in return. To\nquestion him who he is, whence he comes, or wherefore he is here, would\nbe a breach of the law which my father has laid down in this house.\u0094\n\n\u0093So be it,\u0094 said Taee, pressing his hand to his breast; and from that\nmoment, till the one in which I saw him last, this child, with whom I\nbecame very intimate, never once put to me any of the questions thus\ninterdicted.\n\n\n\nChapter IX.\n\n\nIt was not for some time, and until, by repeated trances, if they are to\nbe so called, my mind became better prepared to interchange ideas with\nmy entertainers, and more fully to comprehend differences of manners\nand customs, at first too strange to my experience to be seized by my\nreason, that I was enabled to gather the following details respecting\nthe origin and history of the subterranean population, as portion of one\ngreat family race called the Ana.\n\nAccording to the earliest traditions, the remote progenitors of the\nrace had once tenanted a world above the surface of that in which their\ndescendants dwelt. Myths of that world were still preserved in their\narchives, and in those myths were legends of a vaulted dome in which the\nlamps were lighted by no human hand. But such legends were considered by\nmost commentators as allegorical fables. According to these traditions\nthe earth itself, at the date to which the traditions ascend, was not\nindeed in its infancy, but in the throes and travail of transition\nfrom one form of development to another, and subject to many violent\nrevolutions of nature. By one of such revolutions, that portion of the\nupper world inhabited by the ancestors of this race had been subjected\nto inundations, not rapid, but gradual and uncontrollable, in which all,\nsave a scanty remnant, were submerged and perished. Whether this be\na record of our historical and sacred Deluge, or of some earlier one\ncontended for by geologists, I do not pretend to conjecture; though,\naccording to the chronology of this people as compared with that of\nNewton, it must have been many thousands of years before the time of\nNoah. On the other hand, the account of these writers does not harmonise\nwith the opinions most in vogue among geological authorities, inasmuch\nas it places the existence of a human race upon earth at dates long\nanterior to that assigned to the terrestrial formation adapted to the\nintroduction of mammalia. A band of the ill-fated race, thus invaded by\nthe Flood, had, during the march of the waters, taken refuge in caverns\namidst the loftier rocks, and, wandering through these hollows, they\nlost sight of the upper world forever. Indeed, the whole face of the\nearth had been changed by this great revulsion; land had been turned\ninto sea--sea into land. In the bowels of the inner earth, even now,\nI was informed as a positive fact, might be discovered the remains of\nhuman habitation--habitation not in huts and caverns, but in vast cities\nwhose ruins attest the civilisation of races which flourished before\nthe age of Noah, and are not to be classified with those genera to which\nphilosophy ascribes the use of flint and the ignorance of iron.\n\nThe fugitives had carried with them the knowledge of the arts they had\npractised above ground--arts of culture and civilisation. Their earliest\nwant must have been that of supplying below the earth the light they had\nlost above it; and at no time, even in the traditional period, do the\nraces, of which the one I now sojourned with formed a tribe, seem to\nhave been unacquainted with the art of extracting light from gases, or\nmanganese, or petroleum. They had been accustomed in their former state\nto contend with the rude forces of nature; and indeed the lengthened\nbattle they had fought with their conqueror Ocean, which had taken\ncenturies in its spread, had quickened their skill in curbing waters\ninto dikes and channels. To this skill they owed their preservation in\ntheir new abode. \u0093For many generations,\u0094 said my host, with a sort\nof contempt and horror, \u0093these primitive forefathers are said to have\ndegraded their rank and shortened their lives by eating the flesh of\nanimals, many varieties of which had, like themselves, escaped the\nDeluge, and sought shelter in the hollows of the earth; other animals,\nsupposed to be unknown to the upper world, those hollows themselves\nproduced.\u0094\n\nWhen what we should term the historical age emerged from the twilight\nof tradition, the Ana were already established in different communities,\nand had attained to a degree of civilisation very analogous to that\nwhich the more advanced nations above the earth now enjoy. They\nwere familiar with most of our mechanical inventions, including the\napplication of steam as well as gas. The communities were in fierce\ncompetition with each other. They had their rich and their poor; they\nhad orators and conquerors; they made war either for a domain or\nan idea. Though the various states acknowledged various forms of\ngovernment, free institutions were beginning to preponderate; popular\nassemblies increased in power; republics soon became general; the\ndemocracy to which the most enlightened European politicians look\nforward as the extreme goal of political advancement, and which\nstill prevailed among other subterranean races, whom they despised as\nbarbarians, the loftier family of Ana, to which belonged the tribe I was\nvisiting, looked back to as one of the crude and ignorant experiments\nwhich belong to the infancy of political science. It was the age of envy\nand hate, of fierce passions, of constant social changes more or less\nviolent, of strife between classes, of war between state and state. This\nphase of society lasted, however, for some ages, and was finally brought\nto a close, at least among the nobler and more intellectual\npopulations, by the gradual discovery of the latent powers stored in the\nall-permeating fluid which they denominate Vril.\n\nAccording to the account I received from Zee, who, as an erudite\nprofessor of the College of Sages, had studied such matters more\ndiligently than any other member of my host\u0092s family, this fluid is\ncapable of being raised and disciplined into the mightiest agency over\nall forms of matter, animate or inanimate. It can destroy like the flash\nof lightning; yet, differently applied, it can replenish or invigorate\nlife, heal, and preserve, and on it they chiefly rely for the cure\nof disease, or rather for enabling the physical organisation to\nre-establish the due equilibrium of its natural powers, and thereby\nto cure itself. By this agency they rend way through the most solid\nsubstances, and open valleys for culture through the rocks of their\nsubterranean wilderness. From it they extract the light which supplies\ntheir lamps, finding it steadier, softer, and healthier than the other\ninflammable materials they had formerly used.\n\nBut the effects of the alleged discovery of the means to direct the more\nterrible force of vril were chiefly remarkable in their influence upon\nsocial polity. As these effects became familiarly known and skillfully\nadministered, war between the vril-discoverers ceased, for they brought\nthe art of destruction to such perfection as to annul all superiority in\nnumbers, discipline, or military skill. The fire lodged in the hollow\nof a rod directed by the hand of a child could shatter the strongest\nfortress, or cleave its burning way from the van to the rear of an\nembattled host. If army met army, and both had command of this agency,\nit could be but to the annihilation of each. The age of war was\ntherefore gone, but with the cessation of war other effects bearing\nupon the social state soon became apparent. Man was so completely at\nthe mercy of man, each whom he encountered being able, if so willing,\nto slay him on the instant, that all notions of government by force\ngradually vanished from political systems and forms of law. It is only\nby force that vast communities, dispersed through great distances of\nspace, can be kept together; but now there was no longer either the\nnecessity of self-preservation or the pride of aggrandisement to make\none state desire to preponderate in population over another.\n\nThe Vril-discoverers thus, in the course of a few generations,\npeacefully split into communities of moderate size. The tribe amongst\nwhich I had fallen was limited to 12,000 families. Each tribe occupied\na territory sufficient for all its wants, and at stated periods the\nsurplus population departed to seek a realm of its own. There appeared\nno necessity for any arbitrary selection of these emigrants; there was\nalways a sufficient number who volunteered to depart.\n\nThese subdivided states, petty if we regard either territory or\npopulation,--all appertained to one vast general family. They spoke\nthe same language, though the dialects might slightly differ. They\nintermarried; They maintained the same general laws and customs; and so\nimportant a bond between these several communities was the knowledge\nof vril and the practice of its agencies, that the word A-Vril was\nsynonymous with civilisation; and Vril-ya, signifying \u0093The Civilised\nNations,\u0094 was the common name by which the communities employing the\nuses of vril distinguished themselves from such of the Ana as were yet\nin a state of barbarism.\n\nThe government of the tribe of Vril-ya I am treating of was apparently\nvery complicated, really very simple. It was based upon a principle\nrecognised in theory, though little carried out in practice, above\nground--viz., that the object of all systems of philosophical thought\ntends to the attainment of unity, or the ascent through all intervening\nlabyrinths to the simplicity of a single first cause or principle.\nThus in politics, even republican writers have agreed that a benevolent\nautocracy would insure the best administration, if there were any\nguarantees for its continuance, or against its gradual abuse of the\npowers accorded to it. This singular community elected therefore a\nsingle supreme magistrate styled Tur; he held his office nominally\nfor life, but he could seldom be induced to retain it after the first\napproach of old age. There was indeed in this society nothing to induce\nany of its members to covet the cares of office. No honours, no insignia\nof higher rank, were assigned to it. The supreme magistrate was not\ndistinguished from the rest by superior habitation or revenue. On the\nother hand, the duties awarded to him were marvellously light and easy,\nrequiring no preponderant degree of energy or intelligence. There being\nno apprehensions of war, there were no armies to maintain; there being\nno government of force, there was no police to appoint and direct. What\nwe call crime was utterly unknown to the Vril-ya; and there were no\ncourts of criminal justice. The rare instances of civil disputes were\nreferred for arbitration to friends chosen by either party, or decided\nby the Council of Sages, which will be described later. There were\nno professional lawyers; and indeed their laws were but amicable\nconventions, for there was no power to enforce laws against an offender\nwho carried in his staff the power to destroy his judges. There were\ncustoms and regulations to compliance with which, for several ages,\nthe people had tacitly habituated themselves; or if in any instance an\nindividual felt such compliance hard, he quitted the community and went\nelsewhere. There was, in fact, quietly established amid this state,\nmuch the same compact that is found in our private families, in which we\nvirtually say to any independent grown-up member of the family whom\nwe receive to entertain, \u0093Stay or go, according as our habits and\nregulations suit or displease you.\u0094 But though there were no laws such\nas we call laws, no race above ground is so law-observing. Obedience to\nthe rule adopted by the community has become as much an instinct as\nif it were implanted by nature. Even in every household the head of it\nmakes a regulation for its guidance, which is never resisted nor even\ncavilled at by those who belong to the family. They have a proverb,\nthe pithiness of which is much lost in this paraphrase, \u0093No happiness\nwithout order, no order without authority, no authority without unity.\u0094\n The mildness of all government among them, civil or domestic, may be\nsignalised by their idiomatic expressions for such terms as illegal or\nforbidden--viz., \u0093It is requested not to do so and so.\u0094 Poverty among\nthe Ana is as unknown as crime; not that property is held in common, or\nthat all are equals in the extent of their possessions or the size and\nluxury of their habitations: but there being no difference of rank or\nposition between the grades of wealth or the choice of occupations, each\npursues his own inclinations without creating envy or vying; some like\na modest, some a more splendid kind of life; each makes himself happy in\nhis own way. Owing to this absence of competition, and the limit placed\non the population, it is difficult for a family to fall into distress;\nthere are no hazardous speculations, no emulators striving for superior\nwealth and rank. No doubt, in each settlement all originally had the\nsame proportions of land dealt out to them; but some, more adventurous\nthan others, had extended their possessions farther into the bordering\nwilds, or had improved into richer fertility the produce of their\nfields, or entered into commerce or trade. Thus, necessarily, some\nhad grown richer than others, but none had become absolutely poor, or\nwanting anything which their tastes desired. If they did so, it was\nalways in their power to migrate, or at the worst to apply, without\nshame and with certainty of aid, to the rich, for all the members of\nthe community considered themselves as brothers of one affectionate and\nunited family. More upon this head will be treated of incidentally as my\nnarrative proceeds.\n\nThe chief care of the supreme magistrate was to communicate with certain\nactive departments charged with the administration of special details.\nThe most important and essential of such details was that connected with\nthe due provision of light. Of this department my host, Aph-Lin, was\nthe chief. Another department, which might be called the foreign,\ncommunicated with the neighbouring kindred states, principally for the\npurpose of ascertaining all new inventions; and to a third department\nall such inventions and improvements in machinery were committed for\ntrial. Connected with this department was the College of Sages--a\ncollege especially favoured by such of the Ana as were widowed and\nchildless, and by the young unmarried females, amongst whom Zee was\nthe most active, and, if what we call renown or distinction was a thing\nacknowledged by this people (which I shall later show it is not), among\nthe more renowned or distinguished. It is by the female Professors\nof this College that those studies which are deemed of least use in\npractical life--as purely speculative philosophy, the history of remote\nperiods, and such sciences as entomology, conchology, &c.--are the more\ndiligently cultivated. Zee, whose mind, active as Aristotle\u0092s, equally\nembraced the largest domains and the minutest details of thought, had\nwritten two volumes on the parasite insect that dwells amid the hairs\nof a tiger\u0092s* paw, which work was considered the best authority on that\ninteresting subject.\n\n* The animal here referred to has many points of difference from the\ntiger of the upper world. It is larger, and with a broader paw, and\nstill more receding frontal. It haunts the side of lakes and pools,\nand feeds principally on fishes, though it does not object to any\nterrestrial animal of inferior strength that comes in its way. It is\nbecoming very scarce even in the wild districts, where it is devoured\nby gigantic reptiles. I apprehended that it clearly belongs to the tiger\nspecies, since the parasite animalcule found in its paw, like that in\nthe Asiatic tiger, is a miniature image of itself.\n\nBut the researches of the sages are not confined to such subtle or\nelegant studies. They comprise various others more important, and\nespecially the properties of vril, to the perception of which their\nfiner nervous organisation renders the female Professors eminently keen.\nIt is out of this college that the Tur, or chief magistrate, selects\nCouncillors, limited to three, in the rare instances in which novelty of\nevent or circumstance perplexes his own judgment.\n\nThere are a few other departments of minor consequence, but all are\ncarried on so noiselessly, and quietly that the evidence of a government\nseems to vanish altogether, and social order to be as regular and\nunobtrusive as if it were a law of nature. Machinery is employed to an\ninconceivable extent in all the operations of labour within and without\ndoors, and it is the unceasing object of the department charged with its\nadministration to extend its efficiency. There is no class of labourers\nor servants, but all who are required to assist or control the machinery\nare found in the children, from the time they leave the care of their\nmothers to the marriageable age, which they place at sixteen for the\nGy-ei (the females), twenty for the Ana (the males). These children are\nformed into bands and sections under their own chiefs, each following\nthe pursuits in which he is most pleased, or for which he feels himself\nmost fitted. Some take to handicrafts, some to agriculture, some to\nhousehold work, and some to the only services of danger to which the\npopulation is exposed; for the sole perils that threaten this tribe are,\nfirst, from those occasional convulsions within the earth, to foresee\nand guard against which tasks their utmost ingenuity--irruptions of fire\nand water, the storms of subterranean winds and escaping gases. At\nthe borders of the domain, and at all places where such peril might\nbe apprehended, vigilant inspectors are stationed with telegraphic\ncommunications to the hall in which chosen sages take it by turns to\nhold perpetual sittings. These inspectors are always selected from the\nelder boys approaching the age of puberty, and on the principle that at\nthat age observation is more acute and the physical forces more alert\nthan at any other. The second service of danger, less grave, is in the\ndestruction of all creatures hostile to the life, or the culture, or\neven the comfort, of the Ana. Of these the most formidable are the vast\nreptiles, of some of which antediluvian relics are preserved in our\nmuseums, and certain gigantic winged creatures, half bird, half reptile.\nThese, together with lesser wild animals, corresponding to our tigers\nor venomous serpents, it is left to the younger children to hunt and\ndestroy; because, according to the Ana, here ruthlessness is wanted,\nand the younger the child the more ruthlessly he will destroy. There is\nanother class of animals in the destruction of which discrimination\nis to be used, and against which children of intermediate age are\nappointed--animals that do not threaten the life of man, but ravage the\nproduce of his labour, varieties of the elk and deer species, and\na smaller creature much akin to our rabbit, though infinitely more\ndestructive to crops, and much more cunning in its mode of depredation.\nIt is the first object of these appointed infants, to tame the more\nintelligent of such animals into respect for enclosures signalised by\nconspicuous landmarks, as dogs are taught to respect a larder, or even\nto guard the master\u0092s property. It is only where such creatures are\nfound untamable to this extent that they are destroyed. Life is never\ntaken away for food or for sport, and never spared where untamably\ninimical to the Ana. Concomitantly with these bodily services and tasks,\nthe mental education of the children goes on till boyhood ceases. It is\nthe general custom, then, to pass though a course of instruction at\nthe College of Sages, in which, besides more general studies, the pupil\nreceives special lessons in such vocation or direction of intellect\nas he himself selects. Some, however, prefer to pass this period of\nprobation in travel, or to emigrate, or to settle down at once\ninto rural or commercial pursuits. No force is put upon individual\ninclination.\n\n\n\nChapter X.\n\n\nThe word Ana (pronounced broadly \u0091Arna\u0092) corresponds with our plural\n\u0091men;\u0092 An (pronounced \u0091Arn\u0092), the singular, with \u0091man.\u0092 The word for\nwoman is Gy (pronounced hard, as in Guy); it forms itself into Gy-ei for\nthe plural, but the G becomes soft in the plural like Jy-ei. They have\na proverb to the effect that this difference in pronunciation is\nsymbolical, for that the female sex is soft in the concrete, but hard to\ndeal with in the individual. The Gy-ei are in the fullest enjoyment of\nall the rights of equality with males, for which certain philosophers\nabove ground contend.\n\nIn childhood they perform the offices of work and labour impartially\nwith the boys, and, indeed, in the earlier age appropriated to the\ndestruction of animals irreclaimably hostile, the girls are frequently\npreferred, as being by constitution more ruthless under the influence of\nfear or hate. In the interval between infancy and the marriageable age\nfamiliar intercourse between the sexes is suspended. At the marriageable\nage it is renewed, never with worse consequences than those which attend\nupon marriage. All arts and vocations allotted to the one sex are open\nto the other, and the Gy-ei arrogate to themselves a superiority in all\nthose abstruse and mystical branches of reasoning, for which they say\nthe Ana are unfitted by a duller sobriety of understanding, or the\nroutine of their matter-of-fact occupations, just as young ladies in our\nown world constitute themselves authorities in the subtlest points of\ntheological doctrine, for which few men, actively engaged in worldly\nbusiness have sufficient learning or refinement of intellect.\nWhether owing to early training in gymnastic exercises, or to their\nconstitutional organisation, the Gy-ei are usually superior to the Ana\nin physical strength (an important element in the consideration and\nmaintenance of female rights). They attain to loftier stature, and amid\ntheir rounder proportions are imbedded sinews and muscles as hardy\nas those of the other sex. Indeed they assert that, according to the\noriginal laws of nature, females were intended to be larger than males,\nand maintain this dogma by reference to the earliest formations of life\nin insects, and in the most ancient family of the vertebrata--viz.,\nfishes--in both of which the females are generally large enough to make\na meal of their consorts if they so desire. Above all, the Gy-ei have a\nreadier and more concentred power over that mysterious fluid or agency\nwhich contains the element of destruction, with a larger portion of that\nsagacity which comprehends dissimulation. Thus they cannot only defend\nthemselves against all aggressions from the males, but could, at any\nmoment when he least expected his danger, terminate the existence of an\noffending spouse. To the credit of the Gy-ei no instance of their abuse\nof this awful superiority in the art of destruction is on record for\nseveral ages. The last that occurred in the community I speak of appears\n(according to their chronology) to have been about two thousand years\nago. A Gy, then, in a fit of jealousy, slew her husband; and this\nabominable act inspired such terror among the males that they emigrated\nin a body and left all the Gy-ei to themselves. The history runs that\nthe widowed Gy-ei, thus reduced to despair, fell upon the murderess when\nin her sleep (and therefore unarmed), and killed her, and then entered\ninto a solemn obligation amongst themselves to abrogate forever the\nexercise of their extreme conjugal powers, and to inculcate the\nsame obligation for ever and ever on their female children. By this\nconciliatory process, a deputation despatched to the fugitive consorts\nsucceeded in persuading many to return, but those who did return were\nmostly the elder ones. The younger, either from too craven a doubt of\ntheir consorts, or too high an estimate of their own merits, rejected\nall overtures, and, remaining in other communities, were caught up there\nby other mates, with whom perhaps they were no better off. But the loss\nof so large a portion of the male youth operated as a salutary warning\non the Gy-ei, and confirmed them in the pious resolution to which they\npledged themselves. Indeed it is now popularly considered that, by long\nhereditary disuse, the Gy-ei have lost both the aggressive and defensive\nsuperiority over the Ana which they once possessed, just as in the\ninferior animals above the earth many peculiarities in their original\nformation, intended by nature for their protection, gradually fade or\nbecome inoperative when not needed under altered circumstances. I should\nbe sorry, however, for any An who induced a Gy to make the experiment\nwhether he or she were the stronger.\n\nFrom the incident I have narrated, the Ana date certain alterations in\nthe marriage customs, tending, perhaps, somewhat to the advantage of the\nmale. They now bind themselves in wedlock only for three years; at the\nend of each third year either male or female can divorce the other and\nis free to marry again. At the end of ten years the An has the privilege\nof taking a second wife, allowing the first to retire if she so please.\nThese regulations are for the most part a dead letter; divorces and\npolygamy are extremely rare, and the marriage state now seems\nsingularly happy and serene among this astonishing people;--the Gy-ei,\nnotwithstanding their boastful superiority in physical strength and\nintellectual abilities, being much curbed into gentle manners by the\ndread of separation or of a second wife, and the Ana being very much the\ncreatures of custom, and not, except under great aggravation, likely\nto exchange for hazardous novelties faces and manners to which they\nare reconciled by habit. But there is one privilege the Gy-ei carefully\nretain, and the desire for which perhaps forms the secret motive of most\nlady asserters of woman rights above ground. They claim the privilege,\nhere usurped by men, of proclaiming their love and urging their suit;\nin other words, of being the wooing party rather than the wooed. Such a\nphenomenon as an old maid does not exist among the Gy-ei. Indeed it\nis very seldom that a Gy does not secure any An upon whom she sets her\nheart, if his affections be not strongly engaged elsewhere. However coy,\nreluctant, and prudish, the male she courts may prove at first, yet her\nperseverance, her ardour, her persuasive powers, her command over the\nmystic agencies of vril, are pretty sure to run down his neck into\nwhat we call \u0093the fatal noose.\u0094 Their argument for the reversal of that\nrelationship of the sexes which the blind tyranny of man has established\non the surface of the earth, appears cogent, and is advanced with a\nfrankness which might well be commended to impartial consideration.\nThey say, that of the two the female is by nature of a more loving\ndisposition than the male--that love occupies a larger space in her\nthoughts, and is more essential to her happiness, and that therefore\nshe ought to be the wooing party; that otherwise the male is a shy and\ndubitant creature--that he has often a selfish predilection for the\nsingle state--that he often pretends to misunderstand tender glances\nand delicate hints--that, in short, he must be resolutely pursued and\ncaptured. They add, moreover, that unless the Gy can secure the An of\nher choice, and one whom she would not select out of the whole world\nbecomes her mate, she is not only less happy than she otherwise would\nbe, but she is not so good a being, that her qualities of heart are not\nsufficiently developed; whereas the An is a creature that less lastingly\nconcentrates his affections on one object; that if he cannot get the\nGy whom he prefers he easily reconciles himself to another Gy; and,\nfinally, that at the worst, if he is loved and taken care of, it is less\nnecessary to the welfare of his existence that he should love as well\nas be loved; he grows contented with his creature comforts, and the many\noccupations of thought which he creates for himself.\n\nWhatever may be said as to this reasoning, the system works well for the\nmale; for being thus sure that he is truly and ardently loved, and that\nthe more coy and reluctant he shows himself, the more determination\nto secure him increases, he generally contrives to make his consent\ndependent on such conditions as he thinks the best calculated to insure,\nif not a blissful, at least a peaceful life. Each individual An has his\nown hobbies, his own ways, his own predilections, and, whatever they may\nbe, he demands a promise of full and unrestrained concession to them.\nThis, in the pursuit of her object, the Gy readily promises; and as the\ncharacteristic of this extraordinary people is an implicit veneration\nfor truth, and her word once given is never broken even by the giddiest\nGy, the conditions stipulated for are religiously observed. In fact,\nnotwithstanding all their abstract rights and powers, the Gy-ei are the\nmost amiable, conciliatory, and submissive wives I have ever seen even\nin the happiest households above ground. It is an aphorism among them,\nthat \u0093where a Gy loves it is her pleasure to obey.\u0094 It will be observed\nthat in the relationship of the sexes I have spoken only of marriage,\nfor such is the moral perfection to which this community has attained,\nthat any illicit connection is as little possible amongst them as it\nwould be to a couple of linnets during the time they agree to live in\npairs.\n\n\n\nChapter XI.\n\n\nNothing had more perplexed me in seeking to reconcile my sense to the\nexistence of regions extending below the surface of the earth, and\nhabitable by beings, if dissimilar from, still, in all material points\nof organism, akin to those in the upper world, than the contradiction\nthus presented to the doctrine in which, I believe, most geologists\nand philosophers concur--viz., that though with us the sun is the great\nsource of heat, yet the deeper we go beneath the crust of the earth, the\ngreater is the increasing heat, being, it is said, found in the ratio of\na degree for every foot, commencing from fifty feet below the surface.\nBut though the domains of the tribe I speak of were, on the higher\nground, so comparatively near to the surface, that I could account for a\ntemperature, therein, suitable to organic life, yet even the ravines and\nvalleys of that realm were much less hot than philosophers would deem\npossible at such a depth--certainly not warmer than the south of France,\nor at least of Italy. And according to all the accounts I received, vast\ntracts immeasurably deeper beneath the surface, and in which one might\nhave thought only salamanders could exist, were inhabited by innumerable\nraces organised like ourselves, I cannot pretend in any way to account\nfor a fact which is so at variance with the recognised laws of science,\nnor could Zee much help me towards a solution of it. She did but\nconjecture that sufficient allowance had not been made by our\nphilosophers for the extreme porousness of the interior earth--the\nvastness of its cavities and irregularities, which served to create free\ncurrents of air and frequent winds--and for the various modes in which\nheat is evaporated and thrown off. She allowed, however, that there was\na depth at which the heat was deemed to be intolerable to such organised\nlife as was known to the experience of the Vril-ya, though their\nphilosophers believed that even in such places life of some kind, life\nsentient, life intellectual, would be found abundant and thriving, could\nthe philosophers penetrate to it. \u0093Wherever the All-Good builds,\u0094\n said she, \u0093there, be sure, He places inhabitants. He loves not empty\ndwellings.\u0094 She added, however, that many changes in temperature and\nclimate had been effected by the skill of the Vril-ya, and that the\nagency of vril had been successfully employed in such changes. She\ndescribed a subtle and life-giving medium called Lai, which I suspect\nto be identical with the ethereal oxygen of Dr. Lewins, wherein work all\nthe correlative forces united under the name of vril; and contended that\nwherever this medium could be expanded, as it were, sufficiently for the\nvarious agencies of vril to have ample play, a temperature congenial to\nthe highest forms of life could be secured. She said also, that it was\nthe belief of their naturalists that flowers and vegetation had been\nproduced originally (whether developed from seeds borne from the surface\nof the earth in the earlier convulsions of nature, or imported by\nthe tribes that first sought refuge in cavernous hollows) through the\noperations of the light constantly brought to bear on them, and the\ngradual improvement in culture. She said also, that since the vril light\nhad superseded all other light-giving bodies, the colours of flower and\nfoliage had become more brilliant, and vegetation had acquired larger\ngrowth.\n\nLeaving these matters to the consideration of those better competent to\ndeal with them, I must now devote a few pages to the very interesting\nquestions connected with the language of the Vril-ya.\n\n\n\nChapter XII.\n\n\nThe language of the Vril-ya is peculiarly interesting, because it seems\nto me to exhibit with great clearness the traces of the three main\ntransitions through which language passes in attaining to perfection of\nform.\n\nOne of the most illustrious of recent philologists, Max Muller, in\narguing for the analogy between the strata of language and the strata\nof the earth, lays down this absolute dogma: \u0093No language can, by\nany possibility, be inflectional without having passed through the\nagglutinative and isolating stratum. No language can be agglutinative\nwithout clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum of\nisolation.\u0094--\u0091On the Stratification of Language,\u0092 p. 20.\n\nTaking then the Chinese language as the best existing type of the\noriginal isolating stratum, \u0093as the faithful photograph of man in his\nleading-strings trying the muscles of his mind, groping his way, and so\ndelighted with his first successful grasps that he repeats them again\nand again,\u0094 (Max Muller, p. 3)--we have, in the language of the Vril-ya,\nstill \u0093clinging with its roots to the underlying stratum,\u0094 the evidences\nof the original isolation. It abounds in monosyllables, which are the\nfoundations of the language. The transition into the agglutinative\nform marks an epoch that must have gradually extended through ages,\nthe written literature of which has only survived in a few fragments of\nsymbolical mythology and certain pithy sentences which have passed\ninto popular proverbs. With the extant literature of the Vril-ya the\ninflectional stratum commences. No doubt at that time there must have\noperated concurrent causes, in the fusion of races by some dominant\npeople, and the rise of some great literary phenomena by which the\nform of language became arrested and fixed. As the inflectional stage\nprevailed over the agglutinative, it is surprising to see how much more\nboldly the original roots of the language project from the surface that\nconceals them. In the old fragments and proverbs of the preceding stage\nthe monosyllables which compose those roots vanish amidst words of\nenormous length, comprehending whole sentences from which no one part\ncan be disentangled from the other and employed separately. But when\nthe inflectional form of language became so far advanced as to have its\nscholars and grammarians, they seem to have united in extirpating all\nsuch polysynthetical or polysyllabic monsters, as devouring invaders of\nthe aboriginal forms. Words beyond three syllables became proscribed\nas barbarous and in proportion as the language grew thus simplified it\nincreased in strength, in dignity, and in sweetness. Though now very\ncompressed in sound, it gains in clearness by that compression. By a\nsingle letter, according to its position, they contrive to express\nall that with civilised nations in our upper world it takes the waste,\nsometimes of syllables, sometimes of sentences, to express. Let me here\ncite one or two instances: An (which I will translate man), Ana (men);\nthe letter \u0091s\u0092 is with them a letter implying multitude, according to\nwhere it is placed; Sana means mankind; Ansa, a multitude of men. The\nprefix of certain letters in their alphabet invariably denotes compound\nsignifications. For instance, Gl (which with them is a single letter, as\n\u0091th\u0092 is a single letter with the Greeks) at the commencement of a word\ninfers an assemblage or union of things, sometimes kindred, sometimes\ndissimilar--as Oon, a house; Gloon, a town (i. e., an assemblage of\nhouses). Ata is sorrow; Glata, a public calamity. Aur-an is the health\nor wellbeing of a man; Glauran, the wellbeing of the state, the good of\nthe community; and a word constantly in ther mouths is A-glauran, which\ndenotes their political creed--viz., that \u0093the first principle of a\ncommunity is the good of all.\u0094 Aub is invention; Sila, a tone in music.\nGlaubsila, as uniting the ideas of invention and of musical intonation,\nis the classical word for poetry--abbreviated, in ordinary conversation,\nto Glaubs. Na, which with them is, like Gl, but a single letter, always,\nwhen an initial, implies something antagonistic to life or joy or\ncomfort, resembling in this the Aryan root Nak, expressive of perishing\nor destruction. Nax is darkness; Narl, death; Naria, sin or evil.\nNas--an uttermost condition of sin and evil--corruption. In writing,\nthey deem it irreverent to express the Supreme Being by any special\nname. He is symbolized by what may be termed the heiroglyphic of a\npyramid, \/\\. In prayer they address Him by a name which they deem too\nsacred to confide to a stranger, and I know it not. In conversation they\ngenerally use a periphrastic epithet, such as the All-Good. The letter\nV, symbolical of the inverted pyramid, where it is an initial, nearly\nalways denotes excellence of power; as Vril, of which I have said so\nmuch; Veed, an immortal spirit; Veed-ya, immortality; Koom, pronounced\nlike the Welsh Cwm, denotes something of hollowness. Koom itself is\na cave; Koom-in, a hole; Zi-koom, a valley; Koom-zi, vacancy or void;\nBodh-koom, ignorance (literally, knowledge-void). Koom-posh is their\nname for the government of the many, or the ascendancy of the most\nignorant or hollow. Posh is an almost untranslatable idiom, implying, as\nthe reader will see later, contempt. The closest rendering I can give to\nit is our slang term, \u0093bosh;\u0094 and this Koom-Posh may be loosely rendered\n\u0093Hollow-Bosh.\u0094 But when Democracy or Koom-Posh degenerates from popular\nignorance into that popular passion or ferocity which precedes its\ndecease, as (to cite illustrations from the upper world) during the\nFrench Reign of Terror, or for the fifty years of the Roman Republic\npreceding the ascendancy of Augustus, their name for that state of\nthings is Glek-Nas. Ek is strife--Glek, the universal strife. Nas, as I\nbefore said, is corruption or rot; thus, Glek-Nas may be construed, \u0093the\nuniversal strife-rot.\u0094 Their compounds are very expressive; thus,\nBodh being knowledge, and Too a participle that implies the action of\ncautiously approaching,--Too-bodh is their word for Philosophy; Pah is\na contemptuous exclamation analogous to our idiom, \u0093stuff and nonsense;\u0094\n Pah-bodh (literally stuff and nonsense-knowledge) is their term for\nfutile and false philosophy, and applied to a species of metaphysical or\nspeculative ratiocination formerly in vogue, which consisted in making\ninquiries that could not be answered, and were not worth making; such,\nfor instance, as \u0093Why does an An have five toes to his feet instead of\nfour or six? Did the first An, created by the All-Good, have the same\nnumber of toes as his descendants? In the form by which an An will be\nrecognised by his friends in the future state of being, will he retain\nany toes at all, and, if so, will they be material toes or spiritual\ntoes?\u0094 I take these illustrations of Pahbodh, not in irony or jest, but\nbecause the very inquiries I name formed the subject of controversy by\nthe latest cultivators of that \u0091science,\u0092--4000 years ago.\n\nIn the declension of nouns I was informed that anciently there were\neight cases (one more than in the Sanskrit Grammar); but the effect\nof time has been to reduce these cases, and multiply, instead of these\nvarying terminations, explanatory propositions. At present, in the\nGrammar submitted to my study, there were four cases to nouns, three\nhaving varying terminations, and the fourth a differing prefix.\n\n     SINGULAR.

It will be observed that the\nprefix Hil marks the vocative case. It is always retained in addressing\nanother, except in the most intimate domestic relations; its omission\nwould be considered rude: just as in our of forms of speech in\naddressing a king it would have been deemed disrespectful to say \u0093King,\u0094\n and reverential to say \u0093O King.\u0094 In fact, as they have no titles of\nhonour, the vocative adjuration supplies the place of a title, and is\ngiven impartially to all. The prefix Hil enters into the composition of\nwords that imply distant communications, as Hil-ya, to travel.\n\nIn the conjugation of their verbs, which is much too lengthy a subject\nto enter on here, the auxiliary verb Ya, \u0093to go,\u0094 which plays so\nconsiderable part in the Sanskrit, appears and performs a kindred\noffice, as if it were a radical in some language from which both\nhad descended. But another auxiliary or opposite signification also\naccompanies it and shares its labours--viz., Zi, to stay or repose. Thus\nYa enters into the future tense, and Zi in the preterite of all verbs\nrequiring auxiliaries. Yam, I shall go--Yiam, I may go--Yani-ya, I shall\ngo (literally, I go to go), Zam-poo-yan, I have gone (literally, I\nrest from gone). Ya, as a termination, implies by analogy, progress,\nmovement, efflorescence. Zi, as a terminal, denotes fixity, sometimes in\na good sense, sometimes in a bad, according to the word with which it\nis coupled. Iva-zi, eternal goodness; Nan-zi, eternal evil. Poo (from)\nenters as a prefix to words that denote repugnance, or things from\nwhich we ought to be averse. Poo-pra, disgust; Poo-naria, falsehood,\nthe vilest kind of evil. Poosh or Posh I have already confessed to be\nuntranslatable literally. It is an expression of contempt not unmixed\nwith pity. This radical seems to have originated from inherent sympathy\nbetween the labial effort and the sentiment that impelled it, Poo being\nan utterance in which the breath is exploded from the lips with more or\nless vehemence. On the other hand, Z, when an initial, is with them a\nsound in which the breath is sucked inward, and thus Zu, pronounced Zoo\n(which in their language is one letter), is the ordinary prefix to words\nthat signify something that attracts, pleases, touches the heart--as\nZummer, lover; Zutze, love; Zuzulia, delight. This indrawn sound of\nZ seems indeed naturally appropriate to fondness. Thus, even in our\nlanguage, mothers say to their babies, in defiance of grammar, \u0093Zoo\ndarling;\u0094 and I have heard a learned professor at Boston call his wife\n(he had been only married a month) \u0093Zoo little pet.\u0094\n\nI cannot quit this subject, however, without observing by what slight\nchanges in the dialects favoured by different tribes of the same race,\nthe original signification and beauty of sounds may become confused and\ndeformed. Zee told me with much indignation that Zummer (lover) which in\nthe way she uttered it, seemed slowly taken down to the very depths of\nher heart, was, in some not very distant communities of the Vril-ya,\nvitiated into the half-hissing, half-nasal, wholly disagreeable, sound\nof Subber. I thought to myself it only wanted the introduction of \u0091n\u0092\nbefore \u0091u\u0092 to render it into an English word significant of the last\nquality an amorous Gy would desire in her Zummer.\n\nI will but mention another peculiarity in this language which gives\nequal force and brevity to its forms of expressions.\n\nA is with them, as with us, the first letter of the alphabet, and\nis often used as a prefix word by itself to convey a complex idea of\nsovereignty or chiefdom, or presiding principle. For instance, Iva is\ngoodness; Diva, goodness and happiness united; A-Diva is unerring and\nabsolute truth. I have already noticed the value of A in A-glauran,\nso, in vril (to whose properties they trace their present state of\ncivilisation), A-vril, denotes, as I have said, civilisation itself.\n\nThe philologist will have seen from the above how much the language\nof the Vril-ya is akin to the Aryan or Indo-Germanic; but, like all\nlanguages, it contains words and forms in which transfers from very\nopposite sources of speech have been taken. The very title of Tur, which\nthey give to their supreme magistrate, indicates theft from a tongue\nakin to the Turanian. They say themselves that this is a foreign word\nborrowed from a title which their historical records show to have been\nborne by the chief of a nation with whom the ancestors of the Vril-ya\nwere, in very remote periods, on friendly terms, but which has long\nbecome extinct, and they say that when, after the discovery of vril,\nthey remodelled their political institutions, they expressly adopted a\ntitle taken from an extinct race and a dead language for that of their\nchief magistrate, in order to avoid all titles for that office with\nwhich they had previous associations.\n\nShould life be spared to me, I may collect into systematic form such\nknowledge as I acquired of this language during my sojourn amongst the\nVril-ya. But what I have already said will perhaps suffice to show to\ngenuine philological students that a language which, preserving so many\nof the roots in the aboriginal form, and clearing from the immediate,\nbut transitory, polysynthetical stage so many rude incumbrances, has\nattained to such a union of simplicity and compass in its final\ninflectional forms, must have been the gradual work of countless ages\nand many varieties of mind ; that it contains the evidence of fusion\nbetween congenial races, and necessitated, in arriving at the shape of\nwhich I have given examples, the continuous culture of a highly\nthoughtful people.\n\nThat, nevertheless, the literature which belongs to this language is a\nliterature of the past; that the present felicitous state of society at\nwhich the Ana have attained forbids the progressive cultivation of\nliterature, especially in the two main divisions of fiction and history,\n--I shall have occasion to show.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII.\n\n\nThis people have a religion, and, whatever may be said against it, at\nleast it has these strange peculiarities: firstly, that all believe in\nthe creed they profess; secondly, that they all practice the precepts\nwhich the creed inculcates. They unite in the worship of one divine\nCreator and Sustainer of the universe. They believe that it is one of\nthe properties of the all-permeating agency of vril, to transmit to\nthe well-spring of life and intelligence every thought that a living\ncreature can conceive; and though they do not contend that the idea of a\nDiety is innate, yet they say that the An (man) is the only creature,\nso far as their observation of nature extends, to whom \u0091the capacity\nof conceiving that idea,\u0092 with all the trains of thought which open out\nfrom it, is vouchsafed. They hold that this capacity is a privilege that\ncannot have been given in vain, and hence that prayer and thanksgiving\nare acceptable to the divine Creator, and necessary to the complete\ndevelopment of the human creature. They offer their devotions both in\nprivate and public. Not being considered one of their species, I was\nnot admitted into the building or temple in which the public worship is\nrendered; but I am informed that the service is exceedingly short, and\nunattended with any pomp of ceremony. It is a doctrine with the Vril-ya,\nthat earnest devotion or complete abstraction from the actual world\ncannot, with benefit to itself, be maintained long at a stretch by the\nhuman mind, especially in public, and that all attempts to do so either\nlead to fanaticism or to hypocrisy. When they pray in private, it is\nwhen they are alone or with their young children.\n\nThey say that in ancient times there was a great number of books written\nupon speculations as to the nature of the Diety, and upon the forms of\nbelief or worship supposed to be most agreeable to Him. But these were\nfound to lead to such heated and angry disputations as not only to shake\nthe peace of the community and divide families before the most united,\nbut in the course of discussing the attributes of the Diety, the\nexistence of the Diety Himself became argued away, or, what was\nworse, became invested with the passions and infirmities of the human\ndisputants. \u0093For,\u0094 said my host, \u0093since a finite being like an An cannot\npossibly define the Infinite, so, when he endeavours to realise an idea\nof the Divinity, he only reduces the Divinity into an An like himself.\u0094\n During the later ages, therefore, all theological speculations, though\nnot forbidden, have been so discouraged as to have fallen utterly\ninto disuse. The Vril-ya unite in a conviction of a future state, more\nfelicitous and more perfect than the present. If they have very vague\nnotions of the doctrine of rewards and punishments, it is perhaps\nbecause they have no systems of rewards and punishments among\nthemselves, for there are no crimes to punish, and their moral standard\nis so even that no An among them is, upon the whole, considered more\nvirtuous than another. If one excels, perhaps in one virtue, another\nequally excels in some other virtue; If one has his prevalent fault or\ninfirmity, so also another has his. In fact, in their extraordinary\nmode of life. There are so few temptations to wrong, that they are good\n(according to their notions of goodness) merely because they live.\nThey have some fanciful notions upon the continuance of life, when once\nbestowed, even in the vegetable world, as the reader will see in the\nnext chapter.\n\n\n\nChapter XIV.\n\n\nThough, as I have said, the Vril-ya discourage all speculations on the\nnature of the Supreme Being, they appear to concur in a belief by which\nthey think to solve that great problem of the existence of evil which\nhas so perplexed the philosophy of the upper world. They hold that\nwherever He has once given life, with the perceptions of that life,\nhowever faint it be, as in a plant, the life is never destroyed; it\npasses into new and improved forms, though not in this planet (differing\ntherein from the ordinary doctrine of metempsychosis), and that the\nliving thing retains the sense of identity, so that it connects its past\nlife with its future, and is \u0091conscious\u0092 of its progressive improvement\nin the scale of joy. For they say that, without this assumption, they\ncannot, according to the lights of human reason vouchsafed to them,\ndiscover the perfect justice which must be a constituent quality of the\nAll-Wise and the All-Good. Injustice, they say, can only emanate\nfrom three causes: want of wisdom to perceive what is just, want of\nbenevolence to desire, want of power to fulfill it; and that each of\nthese three wants is incompatible in the All-Wise, the All-Good,\nthe All-Powerful. But that, while even in this life, the wisdom,\nthe benevolence, and the power of the Supreme Being are sufficiently\napparent to compel our recognition, the justice necessarily resulting\nfrom those attributes, absolutely requires another life, not for man\nonly, but for every living thing of the inferior orders. That, alike in\nthe animal and the vegetable world, we see one individual rendered, by\ncircumstances beyond its control, exceedingly wretched compared to its\nneighbours--one only exists as the prey of another--even a plant suffers\nfrom disease till it perishes prematurely, while the plant next to it\nrejoices in its vitality and lives out its happy life free from a pang.\nThat it is an erroneous analogy from human infirmities to reply by\nsaying that the Supreme Being only acts by general laws, thereby making\nhis own secondary causes so potent as to mar the essential kindness of\nthe First Cause; and a still meaner and more ignorant conception of the\nAll-Good, to dismiss with a brief contempt all consideration of justice\nfor the myriad forms into which He has infused life, and assume that\njustice is only due to the single product of the An. There is no small\nand no great in the eyes of the divine Life-Giver. But once grant that\nnothing, however humble, which feels that it lives and suffers, can\nperish through the series of ages, that all its suffering here, if\ncontinuous from the moment of its birth to that of its transfer to\nanother form of being, would be more brief compared with eternity than\nthe cry of the new-born is compared to the whole life of a man; and once\nsuppose that this living thing retains its sense of identity when so\ntransformed (for without that sense it could be aware of no future\nbeing), and though, indeed, the fulfilment of divine justice is removed\nfrom the scope of our ken, yet we have a right to assume it to be\nuniform and universal, and not varying and partial, as it would be\nif acting only upon general and secondary laws; because such perfect\njustice flows of necessity from perfectness of knowledge to conceive,\nperfectness of love to will, and perfectness of power to complete it.\n\nHowever fantastic this belief of the Vril-ya may be, it tends perhaps to\nconfirm politically the systems of government which, admitting different\ndegrees of wealth, yet establishes perfect equality in rank, exquisite\nmildness in all relations and intercourse, and tenderness to all created\nthings which the good of the community does not require them to destroy.\nAnd though their notion of compensation to a tortured insect or a\ncankered flower may seem to some of us a very wild crotchet, yet,\nat least, is not a mischievous one; and it may furnish matter for no\nunpleasing reflection to think that within the abysses of earth, never\nlit by a ray from the material heavens, there should have penetrated so\nluminous a conviction of the ineffable goodness of the Creator--so\nfixed an idea that the general laws by which He acts cannot admit of any\npartial injustice or evil, and therefore cannot be comprehended without\nreference to their action over all space and throughout all time. And\nsince, as I shall have occasion to observe later, the intellectual\nconditions and social systems of this subterranean race comprise and\nharmonise great, and apparently antagonistic, varieties in philosophical\ndoctrine and speculation which have from time to time been started,\ndiscussed, dismissed, and have re-appeared amongst thinkers or dreamers\nin the upper world,--so I may perhaps appropriately conclude this\nreference to the belief of the Vril-ya, that self-conscious or sentient\nlife once given is indestructible among inferior creatures as well as\nin man, by an eloquent passage from the work of that eminent zoologist,\nLouis Agassiz, which I have only just met with, many years after I had\ncommitted to paper these recollections of the life of the Vril-ya which\nI now reduce into something like arrangement and form: \u0093The relations\nwhich individual animals bear to one another are of such a character\nthat they ought long ago to have been considered as sufficient proof\nthat no organised being could ever have been called into existence by\nother agency than by the direct intervention of a reflective mind.\nThis argues strongly in favour of the existence in every animal of\nan immaterial principle similar to that which by its excellence and\nsuperior endowments places man so much above the animals; yet the\nprinciple unquestionably exists, and whether it be called sense, reason,\nor instinct, it presents in the whole range of organised beings a series\nof phenomena closely linked together, and upon it are based not only\nthe higher manifestations of the mind, but the very permanence of the\nspecific differences which characterise every organism. Most of the\narguments in favour of the immortality of man apply equally to the\npermanency of this principle in other living beings. May I not add that\na future life in which man would be deprived of that great source of\nenjoyment and intellectual and moral improvement which results from\nthe contemplation of the harmonies of an organic world would involve\na lamentable loss? And may we not look to a spiritual concert of the\ncombined worlds and ALL their inhabitants in the presence of\ntheir Creator as the highest conception of paradise?\u0094--\u0091Essay on\nClassification,\u0092 sect. xvii. p. 97-99.\n\n\n\nChapter XV.\n\n\nKind to me as I found all in this household, the young daughter of my\nhost was the most considerate and thoughtful in her kindness. At her\nsuggestion I laid aside the habiliments in which I had descended\nfrom the upper earth, and adopted the dress of the Vril-ya, with the\nexception of the artful wings which served them, when on foot, as a\ngraceful mantle. But as many of the Vril-ya, when occupied in urban\npursuits, did not wear these wings, this exception created no marked\ndifference between myself and the race among whom I sojourned, and I was\nthus enabled to visit the town without exciting unpleasant curiosity.\nOut of the household no one suspected that I had come from the upper\nworld, and I was but regarded as one of some inferior and barbarous\ntribe whom Aph-Lin entertained as a guest.\n\nThe city was large in proportion to the territory round it, which was of\nno greater extent than many an English or Hungarian nobleman\u0092s estate;\nbut the whole if it, to the verge of the rocks which constituted its\nboundary, was cultivated to the nicest degree, except where certain\nallotments of mountain and pasture were humanely left free to the\nsustenance of the harmless animals they had tamed, though not for\ndomestic use. So great is their kindness towards these humbler\ncreatures, that a sum is devoted from the public treasury for the\npurpose of deporting them to other Vril-ya communities willing to\nreceive them (chiefly new colonies), whenever they become too numerous\nfor the pastures allotted to them in their native place. They do not,\nhowever, multiply to an extent comparable to the ratio at which, with\nus, animals bred for slaughter, increase. It seems a law of nature that\nanimals not useful to man gradually recede from the domains he occupies,\nor even become extinct. It is an old custom of the various sovereign\nstates amidst which the race of the Vril-ya are distributed, to leave\nbetween each state a neutral and uncultivated border-land. In the\ninstance of the community I speak of, this tract, being a ridge of\nsavage rocks, was impassable by foot, but was easily surmounted, whether\nby the wings of the inhabitants or the air-boats, of which I shall speak\nhereafter. Roads through it were also cut for the transit of vehicles\nimpelled by vril. These intercommunicating tracts were always kept\nlighted, and the expense thereof defrayed by a special tax, to which all\nthe communities comprehended in the denomination of Vril-ya contribute\nin settled proportions. By these means a considerable commercial traffic\nwith other states, both near and distant, was carried on. The surplus\nwealth on this special community was chiefly agricultural. The community\nwas also eminent for skill in constructing implements connected with the\narts of husbandry. In exchange for such merchandise it obtained articles\nmore of luxury than necessity. There were few things imported on which\nthey set a higher price than birds taught to pipe artful tunes in\nconcert. These were brought from a great distance, and were marvellous\nfor beauty of song and plumage. I understand that extraordinary care was\ntaken by their breeders and teachers in selection, and that the species\nhad wonderfully improved during the last few years. I saw no other\npet animals among this community except some very amusing and sportive\ncreatures of the Batrachian species, resembling frogs, but with very\nintelligent countenances, which the children were fond of, and kept in\ntheir private gardens. They appear to have no animals akin to our dogs\nor horses, though that learned naturalist, Zee, informed me that such\ncreatures had once existed in those parts, and might now be found in\nregions inhabited by other races than the Vril-ya. She said that they\nhad gradually disappeared from the more civilised world since the\ndiscovery of vril, and the results attending that discovery had\ndispensed with their uses. Machinery and the invention of wings had\nsuperseded the horse as a beast of burden; and the dog was no longer\nwanted either for protection or the chase, as it had been when the\nancestors of the Vril-ya feared the aggressions of their own kind, or\nhunted the lesser animals for food. Indeed, however, so far as the horse\nwas concerned, this region was so rocky that a horse could have been,\nthere, of little use either for pastime or burden. The only creature\nthey use for the latter purpose is a kind of large goat which is much\nemployed on farms. The nature of the surrounding soil in these\ndistricts may be said to have first suggested the invention of wings and\nair-boats. The largeness of space in proportion to the space occupied by\nthe city, was occasioned by the custom of surrounding every house with a\nseparate garden. The broad main street, in which Aph-Lin dwelt, expanded\ninto a vast square, in which were placed the College of Sages and all\nthe public offices; a magnificent fountain of the luminous fluid which I\ncall naptha (I am ignorant of its real nature) in the centre. All these\npublic edifices have a uniform character of massiveness and solidity.\nThey reminded me of the architectural pictures of Martin. Along the\nupper stories of each ran a balcony, or rather a terraced garden,\nsupported by columns, filled with flowering plants, and tenanted by\nmany kinds of tame birds.\n\nFrom the square branched several streets, all broad and brilliantly\nlighted, and ascending up the eminence on either side. In my excursions\nin the town I was never allowed to go alone; Aph-Lin or his daughter was\nmy habitual companion. In this community the adult Gy is seen walking\nwith any young An as familiarly as if there were no difference of sex.\n\nThe retail shops are not very numerous; the persons who attend on a\ncustomer are all children of various ages, and exceedingly intelligent\nand courteous, but without the least touch of importunity or cringing.\nThe shopkeeper himself might or might not be visible; when visible, he\nseemed rarely employed on any matter connected with his professional\nbusiness; and yet he had taken to that business from special liking for\nit, and quite independently of his general sources of fortune.\n\nThe Ana of the community are, on the whole, an indolent set of beings\nafter the active age of childhood. Whether by temperament or philosophy,\nthey rank repose among the chief blessings of life. Indeed, when you\ntake away from a human being the incentives to action which are found in\ncupidity or ambition, it seems to me no wonder that he rests quiet.\n\nIn their ordinary movements they prefer the use of their feet to that\nof their wings. But for their sports or (to indulge in a bold misuse of\nterms) their public \u0091promenades,\u0092 they employ the latter, also for the\naerial dances I have described, as well as for visiting their country\nplaces, which are mostly placed on lofty heights; and, when still young,\nthey prefer their wings for travel into the other regions of the Ana, to\nvehicular conveyances.\n\nThose who accustom themselves to flight can fly, if less rapidly than\nsome birds, yet from twenty-five to thirty miles an hour, and keep up\nthat rate for five or six hours at a stretch. But the Ana generally, on\nreaching middle age, are not fond of rapid movements requiring violent\nexercise. Perhaps for this reason, as they hold a doctrine which our\nown physicians will doubtless approve--viz., that regular transpiration\nthrough the pores of the skin is essential to health, they habitually\nuse the sweating-baths to which we give the name Turkish or Roman,\nsucceeded by douches of perfumed waters. They have great faith in the\nsalubrious virtue of certain perfumes.\n\nIt is their custom also, at stated but rare periods, perhaps four times\na-year when in health, to use a bath charged with vril.*\n\n* I once tried the effect of the vril bath. It was very similar in its\ninvigorating powers to that of the baths at Gastein, the virtues\nof which are ascribed by many physicians to electricity; but though\nsimilar, the effect of the vril bath was more lasting.\n\nThey consider that this fluid, sparingly used, is a great sustainer of\nlife; but used in excess, when in the normal state of health, rather\ntends to reaction and exhausted vitality. For nearly all their diseases,\nhowever, they resort to it as the chief assistant to nature in throwing\noff their complaint.\n\nIn their own way they are the most luxurious of people, but all their\nluxuries are innocent. They may be said to dwell in an atmosphere of\nmusic and fragrance. Every room has its mechanical contrivances for\nmelodious sounds, usually tuned down to soft-murmured notes, which seem\nlike sweet whispers from invisible spirits. They are too accustomed to\nthese gentle sounds to find them a hindrance to conversation, nor, when\nalone, to reflection. But they have a notion that to breathe an air\nfilled with continuous melody and perfume has necessarily an effect\nat once soothing and elevating upon the formation of character and the\nhabits of thought. Though so temperate, and with total abstinence from\nother animal food than milk, and from all intoxicating drinks, they are\ndelicate and dainty to an extreme in food and beverage; and in all their\nsports even the old exhibit a childlike gaiety. Happiness is the end at\nwhich they aim, not as the excitement of a moment, but as the prevailing\ncondition of the entire existence; and regard for the happiness of each\nother is evinced by the exquisite amenity of their manners.\n\nTheir conformation of skull has marked differences from that of any\nknown races in the upper world, though I cannot help thinking it a\ndevelopment, in the course of countless ages of the Brachycephalic type\nof the Age of Stone in Lyell\u0092s \u0091Elements of Geology,\u0092 C. X., p. 113, as\ncompared with the Dolichocephalic type of the beginning of the Age of\nIron, correspondent with that now so prevalent amongst us, and called\nthe Celtic type. It has the same comparative massiveness of forehead,\nnot receding like the Celtic--the same even roundness in the frontal\norgans; but it is far loftier in the apex, and far less pronounced\nin the hinder cranial hemisphere where phrenologists place the animal\norgans. To speak as a phrenologist, the cranium common to the Vril-ya\nhas the organs of weight, number, tune, form, order, causality, very\nlargely developed; that of construction much more pronounced than\nthat of ideality. Those which are called the moral organs, such as\nconscientiousness and benevolence, are amazingly full; amativeness\nand combativeness are both small; adhesiveness large; the organ of\ndestructiveness (i.e., of determined clearance of intervening\nobstacles) immense, but less than that of benevolence; and their\nphiloprogenitiveness takes rather the character of compassion and\ntenderness to things that need aid or protection than of the animal love\nof offspring. I never met with one person deformed or misshapen. The\nbeauty of their countenances is not only in symmetry of feature, but in\na smoothness of surface, which continues without line or wrinkle to the\nextreme of old age, and a serene sweetness of expression, combined with\nthat majesty which seems to come from consciousness of power and the\nfreedom of all terror, physical or moral. It is that very sweetness,\ncombined with that majesty, which inspired in a beholder like myself,\naccustomed to strive with the passions of mankind, a sentiment of\nhumiliation, of awe, of dread. It is such an expression as a painter\nmight give to a demi-god, a genius, an angel. The males of the Vril-ya\nare entirely beardless; the Gy-ei sometimes, in old age, develop a small\nmoustache.\n\nI was surprised to find that the colour of their skin was not uniformly\nthat which I had remarked in those individuals whom I had first\nencountered,--some being much fairer, and even with blue eyes, and hair\nof a deep golden auburn, though still of complexions warmer or richer in\ntone than persons in the north of Europe.\n\nI was told that this admixture of colouring arose from intermarriage\nwith other and more distant tribes of the Vril-ya, who, whether by the\naccident of climate or early distinction of race, were of fairer hues\nthan the tribes of which this community formed one. It was considered\nthat the dark-red skin showed the most ancient family of Ana; but they\nattached no sentiment of pride to that antiquity, and, on the contrary,\nbelieved their present excellence of breed came from frequent crossing\nwith other families differing, yet akin; and they encourage such\nintermarriages, always provided that it be with the Vril-ya nations.\nNations which, not conforming their manners and institutions to those\nof the Vril-ya, nor indeed held capable of acquiring the powers over\nthe vril agencies which it had taken them generations to attain and\ntransmit, were regarded with more disdain than the citizens of New York\nregard the negroes.\n\nI learned from Zee, who had more lore in all matters than any male with\nwhom I was brought into familiar converse, that the superiority of\nthe Vril-ya was supposed to have originated in the intensity of their\nearlier struggles against obstacles in nature amidst the localities\nin which they had first settled. \u0093Wherever,\u0094 said Zee, moralising,\n\u0093wherever goes on that early process in the history of civilisation, by\nwhich life is made a struggle, in which the individual has to put forth\nall his powers to compete with his fellow, we invariably find this\nresult--viz., since in the competition a vast number must perish, nature\nselects for preservation only the strongest specimens. With our\nrace, therefore, even before the discovery of vril, only the highest\norganisations were preserved; and there is among our ancient books a\nlegend, once popularly believed, that we were driven from a region\nthat seems to denote the world you come from, in order to perfect our\ncondition and attain to the purest elimination of our species by the\nseverity of the struggles our forefathers underwent; and that, when our\neducation shall become finally completed, we are destined to return\nto the upper world, and supplant all the inferior races now existing\ntherein.\u0094\n\nAph-Lin and Zee often conversed with me in private upon the\npolitical and social conditions of that upper world, in which Zee so\nphilosophically assumed that the inhabitants were to be exterminated\none day or other by the advent of the Vril-ya. They found in my\naccounts,--in which I continued to do all I could (without launching\ninto falsehoods so positive that they would have been easily detected by\nthe shrewdness of my listeners) to present our powers and ourselves in\nthe most flattering point of view,--perpetual subjects of comparison\nbetween our most civilised populations and the meaner subterranean races\nwhich they considered hopelessly plunged in barbarism, and doomed to\ngradual if certain extinction. But they both agreed in desiring to\nconceal from their community all premature opening into the regions\nlighted by the sun; both were humane, and shrunk from the thought of\nannihilating so many millions of creatures; and the pictures I drew of\nour life, highly coloured as they were, saddened them. In vain I boasted\nof our great men--poets, philosophers, orators, generals--and defied the\nVril-ya to produce their equals. \u0093Alas,\u0094 said Zee, \u0093this predominance\nof the few over the many is the surest and most fatal sign of a race\nincorrigibly savage. See you not that the primary condition of mortal\nhappiness consists in the extinction of that strife and competition\nbetween individuals, which, no matter what forms of government they\nadopt, render the many subordinate to the few, destroy real liberty to\nthe individual, whatever may be the nominal liberty of the state, and\nannul that calm of existence, without which, felicity, mental or bodily,\ncannot be attained? Our notion is, that the more we can assimilate life\nto the existence which our noblest ideas can conceive to be that of\nspirits on the other side of the grave, why, the more we approximate\nto a divine happiness here, and the more easily we glide into the\nconditions of being hereafter. For, surely, all we can imagine of the\nlife of gods, or of blessed immortals, supposes the absence of self-made\ncares and contentious passions, such as avarice and ambition. It seems\nto us that it must be a life of serene tranquility, not indeed without\nactive occupations to the intellectual or spiritual powers,\nbut occupations, of whatsoever nature they be, congenial to the\nidiosyncrasies of each, not forced and repugnant--a life gladdened by\nthe untrammelled interchange of gentle affections, in which the moral\natmosphere utterly kills hate and vengeance, and strife and rivalry.\nSuch is the political state to which all the tribes and families of\nthe Vril-ya seek to attain, and towards that goal all our theories of\ngovernment are shaped. You see how utterly opposed is such a progress to\nthat of the uncivilised nations from which you come, and which aim at\na systematic perpetuity of troubles, and cares, and warring passions\naggravated more and more as their progress storms its way onward. The\nmost powerful of all the races in our world, beyond the pale of the\nVril-ya, esteems itself the best governed of all political societies,\nand to have reached in that respect the extreme end at which political\nwisdom can arrive, so that the other nations should tend more or less to\ncopy it. It has established, on its broadest base, the Koom-Posh--viz.,\nthe government of the ignorant upon the principle of being the most\nnumerous. It has placed the supreme bliss in the vying with each other\nin all things, so that the evil passions are never in repose--vying for\npower, for wealth, for eminence of some kind; and in this rivalry it\nis horrible to hear the vituperation, the slanders, and calumnies which\neven the best and mildest among them heap on each other without remorse\nor shame.\u0094\n\n\u0093Some years ago,\u0094 said Aph-Lin, \u0093I visited this people, and their\nmisery and degradation were the more appalling because they were always\nboasting of their felicity and grandeur as compared with the rest of\ntheir species. And there is no hope that this people, which evidently\nresembles your own, can improve, because all their notions tend to\nfurther deterioration. They desire to enlarge their dominion more and\nmore, in direct antagonism to the truth that, beyond a very limited\nrange, it is impossible to secure to a community the happiness which\nbelongs to a well-ordered family; and the more they mature a system\nby which a few individuals are heated and swollen to a size above the\nstandard slenderness of the millions, the more they chuckle and exact,\nand cry out, \u0091See by what great exceptions to the common littleness of\nour race we prove the magnificent results of our system!\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093In fact,\u0094 resumed Zee, \u0093if the wisdom of human life be to approximate\nto the serene equality of immortals, there can be no more direct flying\noff into the opposite direction than a system which aims at carrying\nto the utmost the inequalities and turbulences of mortals. Nor do I see\nhow, by any forms of religious belief, mortals, so acting, could fit\nthemselves even to appreciate the joys of immortals to which they still\nexpect to be transferred by the mere act of dying. On the contrary,\nminds accustomed to place happiness in things so much the reverse of\ngodlike, would find the happiness of gods exceedingly dull, and would\nlong to get back to a world in which they could quarrel with each\nother.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter XVI.\n\n\nI have spoken so much of the Vril Staff that my reader may expect me\nto describe it. This I cannot do accurately, for I was never allowed to\nhandle it for fear of some terrible accident occasioned by my ignorance\nof its use; and I have no doubt that it requires much skill and practice\nin the exercise of its various powers. It is hollow, and has in the\nhandle several stops, keys, or springs by which its force can be\naltered, modified, or directed--so that by one process it destroys, by\nanother it heals--by one it can rend the rock, by another disperse the\nvapour--by one it affects bodies, by another it can exercise a certain\ninfluence over minds. It is usually carried in the convenient size of\na walking-staff, but it has slides by which it can be lengthened or\nshortened at will. When used for special purposes, the upper part rests\nin the hollow of the palm with the fore and middle fingers protruded.\nI was assured, however, that its power was not equal in all, but\nproportioned to the amount of certain vril properties in the wearer in\naffinity, or \u0091rapport\u0092 with the purposes to be effected. Some were more\npotent to destroy, others to heal, &c.; much also depended on the calm\nand steadiness of volition in the manipulator. They assert that the\nfull exercise of vril power can only be acquired by the constitutional\ntemperament--i.e., by hereditarily transmitted organisation--and that\na female infant of four years old belonging to the Vril-ya races can\naccomplish feats which a life spent in its practice would not enable\nthe strongest and most skilled mechanician, born out of the pale of the\nVril-ya to achieve. All these wands are not equally complicated; those\nintrusted to children are much simpler than those borne by sages of\neither sex, and constructed with a view to the special object on which\nthe children are employed; which as I have before said, is among the\nyoungest children the most destructive. In the wands of wives and\nmothers the correlative destroying force is usually abstracted, the\nhealing power fully charged. I wish I could say more in detail of this\nsingular conductor of the vril fluid, but its machinery is as exquisite\nas its effects are marvellous.\n\nI should say, however, that this people have invented certain tubes by\nwhich the vril fluid can be conducted towards the object it is meant\nto destroy, throughout a distance almost indefinite; at least I put\nit modestly when I say from 500 to 1000 miles. And their mathematical\nscience as applied to such purpose is so nicely accurate, that on\nthe report of some observer in an air-boat, any member of the vril\ndepartment can estimate unerringly the nature of intervening obstacles,\nthe height to which the projectile instrument should be raised, and the\nextent to which it should be charged, so as to reduce to ashes within a\nspace of time too short for me to venture to specify it, a capital twice\nas vast as London.\n\nCertainly these Ana are wonderful mathematicians--wonderful for the\nadaptation of the inventive faculty to practical uses.\n\nI went with my host and his daughter Zee over the great public museum,\nwhich occupies a wing in the College of Sages, and in which are hoarded,\nas curious specimens of the ignorant and blundering experiments of\nancient times, many contrivances on which we pride ourselves as recent\nachievements. In one department, carelessly thrown aside as obsolete\nlumber, are tubes for destroying life by metallic balls and an\ninflammable powder, on the principle of our cannons and catapults, and\neven still more murderous than our latest improvements.\n\nMy host spoke of these with a smile of contempt, such as an artillery\nofficer might bestow on the bows and arrows of the Chinese. In another\ndepartment there were models of vehicles and vessels worked by steam,\nand of an air-balloon which might have been constructed by Montgolfier.\n\u0093Such,\u0094 said Zee, with an air of meditative wisdom--\u0093such were the\nfeeble triflings with nature of our savage forefathers, ere they had\neven a glimmering perception of the properties of vril!\u0094\n\nThis young Gy was a magnificent specimen of the muscular force to which\nthe females of her country attain. Her features were beautiful, like\nthose of all her race: never in the upper world have I seen a face so\ngrand and so faultless, but her devotion to the severer studies had\ngiven to her countenance an expression of abstract thought which\nrendered it somewhat stern when in repose; and such a sternness became\nformidable when observed in connection with her ample shoulders and\nlofty stature. She was tall even for a Gy, and I saw her lift up a\ncannon as easily as I could lift a pocket-pistol. Zee inspired me with a\nprofound terror--a terror which increased when we came into a department\nof the museum appropriated to models of contrivances worked by the\nagency of vril; for here, merely by a certain play of her vril staff,\nshe herself standing at a distance, she put into movement large and\nweighty substances. She seemed to endow them with intelligence, and to\nmake them comprehend and obey her command. She set complicated pieces of\nmachinery into movement, arrested the movement or continued it, until,\nwithin an incredibly short time, various kinds of raw material were\nreproduced as symmetrical works of art, complete and perfect. Whatever\neffect mesmerism or electro-biology produces over the nerves and muscles\nof animated objects, this young Gy produced by the motions of her\nslender rod over the springs and wheels of lifeless mechanism.\n\nWhen I mentioned to my companions my astonishment at this influence\nover inanimate matter--while owning that, in our world, I had witnessed\nphenomena which showed that over certain living organisations certain\nother living organisations could establish an influence genuine in\nitself, but often exaggerated by credulity or craft--Zee, who was more\ninterested in such subjects than her father, bade me stretch forth my\nhand, and then, placing it beside her own, she called my attention to\ncertain distinctions of type and character. In the first place, the\nthumb of the Gy (and, as I afterwards noticed, of all that race, male or\nfemale) was much larger, at once longer and more massive, than is found\nwith our species above ground. There is almost, in this, as great a\ndifference as there is between the thumb of a man and that of a gorilla.\nSecondly, the palm is proportionally thicker than ours--the texture of\nthe skin infinitely finer and softer--its average warmth is greater.\nMore remarkable than all this, is a visible nerve, perceptible under the\nskin, which starts from the wrist skirting the ball of the thumb, and\nbranching, fork-like, at the roots of the fore and middle fingers. \u0093With\nyour slight formation of thumb,\u0094 said the philosophical young Gy, \u0093and\nwith the absence of the nerve which you find more or less developed in\nthe hands of our race, you can never achieve other than imperfect\nand feeble power over the agency of vril; but so far as the nerve is\nconcerned, that is not found in the hands of our earliest progenitors,\nnor in those of the ruder tribes without the pale of the Vril-ya. It has\nbeen slowly developed in the course of generations, commencing in the\nearly achievements, and increasing with the continuous exercise, of the\nvril power; therefore, in the course of one or two thousand years, such\na nerve may possibly be engendered in those higher beings of your\nrace, who devote themselves to that paramount science through which\nis attained command over all the subtler forces of nature permeated\nby vril. But when you talk of matter as something in itself inert\nand motionless, your parents or tutors surely cannot have left you so\nignorant as not to know that no form of matter is motionless and inert:\nevery particle is constantly in motion and constantly acted upon by\nagencies, of which heat is the most apparent and rapid, but vril the\nmost subtle, and, when skilfully wielded, the most powerful. So that,\nin fact, the current launched by my hand and guided by my will does but\nrender quicker and more potent the action which is eternally at work\nupon every particle of matter, however inert and stubborn it may seem.\nIf a heap of metal be not capable of originating a thought of its own,\nyet, through its internal susceptibility to movement, it obtains the\npower to receive the thought of the intellectual agent at work on it; by\nwhich, when conveyed with a sufficient force of the vril power, it is\nas much compelled to obey as if it were displaced by a visible bodily\nforce. It is animated for the time being by the soul thus infused into\nit, so that one may almost say that it lives and reasons. Without this\nwe could not make our automata supply the place of servants.\u0094\n\nI was too much in awe of the thews and the learning of the young Gy\nto hazard the risk of arguing with her. I had read somewhere in my\nschoolboy days that a wise man, disputing with a Roman Emperor, suddenly\ndrew in his horns; and when the emperor asked him whether he had nothing\nfurther to say on his side of the question, replied, \u0093Nay, Caesar, there\nis no arguing against a reasoner who commands ten legions.\u0094\n\nThough I had a secret persuasion that, whatever the real effects of\nvril upon matter, Mr. Faraday could have proved her a very shallow\nphilosopher as to its extent or its causes, I had no doubt that Zee\ncould have brained all the Fellows of the Royal Society, one after the\nother, with a blow of her fist. Every sensible man knows that it is\nuseless to argue with any ordinary female upon matters he comprehends;\nbut to argue with a Gy seven feet high upon the mysteries of vril,--as\nwell argue in a desert, and with a simoon!\n\nAmid the various departments to which the vast building of the College\nof Sages was appropriated, that which interested me most was devoted to\nthe archaeology of the Vril-ya, and comprised a very ancient collection\nof portraits. In these the pigments and groundwork employed were of\nso durable a nature that even pictures said to be executed at dates as\nremote as those in the earliest annals of the Chinese, retained much\nfreshness of colour. In examining this collection, two things especially\nstruck me:--first, that the pictures said to be between 6000 and 7000\nyears old were of a much higher degree of art than any produced within\nthe last 3000 or 4000 years; and, second, that the portraits within the\nformer period much more resembled our own upper world and European types\nof countenance. Some of them, indeed reminded me of the Italian heads\nwhich look out from the canvases of Titian--speaking of ambition or\ncraft, of care or of grief, with furrows in which the passions have\npassed with iron ploughshare. These were the countenances of men who had\nlived in struggle and conflict before the discovery of the latent forces\nof vril had changed the character of society--men who had fought with\neach other for power or fame as we in the upper world fight.\n\nThe type of face began to evince a marked change about a thousand years\nafter the vril revolution, becoming then, with each generation, more\nserene, and in that serenity more terribly distinct from the faces of\nlabouring and sinful men; while in proportion as the beauty and the\ngrandeur of the countenance itself became more fully developed, the art\nof the painter became more tame and monotonous.\n\nBut the greatest curiosity in the collection was that of three portraits\nbelonging to the pre-historical age, and, according to mythical\ntradition, taken by the orders of a philosopher, whose origin and\nattributes were as much mixed up with symbolical fable as those of an\nIndian Budh or a Greek Prometheus.\n\nFrom this mysterious personage, at once a sage and a hero, all the\nprincipal sections of the Vril-ya race pretend to trace a common origin.\n\nThe portraits are of the philosopher himself, of his grandfather, and\ngreat-grandfather. They are all at full length. The philosopher is\nattired in a long tunic which seems to form a loose suit of scaly\narmour, borrowed, perhaps, from some fish or reptile, but the feet and\nhands are exposed: the digits in both are wonderfully long, and webbed.\nHe has little or no perceptible throat, and a low receding forehead, not\nat all the ideal of a sage\u0092s. He has bright brown prominent eyes, a very\nwide mouth and high cheekbones, and a muddy complexion. According to\ntradition, this philosopher had lived to a patriarchal age, extending\nover many centuries, and he remembered distinctly in middle life his\ngrandfather as surviving, and in childhood his great-grandfather; the\nportrait of the first he had taken, or caused to be taken, while yet\nalive--that of the latter was taken from his effigies in mummy.\nThe portrait of his grandfather had the features and aspect of the\nphilosopher, only much more exaggerated: he was not dressed, and the\ncolour of his body was singular; the breast and stomach yellow, the\nshoulders and legs of a dull bronze hue: the great-grandfather was a\nmagnificent specimen of the Batrachian genus, a Giant Frog, \u0091pur et\nsimple.\u0092\n\nAmong the pithy sayings which, according to tradition, the philosopher\nbequeathed to posterity in rhythmical form and sententious brevity, this\nis notably recorded: \u0093Humble yourselves, my descendants; the father of\nyour race was a \u0091twat\u0092 (tadpole): exalt yourselves, my descendants, for\nit was the same Divine Thought which created your father that develops\nitself in exalting you.\u0094\n\nAph-Lin told me this fable while I gazed on the three Batrachian\nportraits. I said in reply: \u0093You make a jest of my supposed ignorance\nand credulity as an uneducated Tish, but though these horrible daubs\nmay be of great antiquity, and were intended, perhaps, for some\nrude caracature, I presume that none of your race even in the less\nenlightened ages, ever believed that the great-grandson of a Frog became\na sententious philosopher; or that any section, I will not say of the\nlofty Vril-ya, but of the meanest varieties of the human race, had its\norigin in a Tadpole.\u0094\n\n\u0093Pardon me,\u0094 answered Aph-Lin: \u0093in what we call the Wrangling or\nPhilosophical Period of History, which was at its height about seven\nthousand years ago, there was a very distinguished naturalist, who\nproved to the satisfaction of numerous disciples such analogical and\nanatomical agreements in structure between an An and a Frog, as to\nshow that out of the one must have developed the other. They had some\ndiseases in common; they were both subject to the same parasitical worms\nin the intestines; and, strange to say, the An has, in his structure, a\nswimming-bladder, no longer of any use to him, but which is a rudiment\nthat clearly proves his descent from a Frog. Nor is there any argument\nagainst this theory to be found in the relative difference of size, for\nthere are still existent in our world Frogs of a size and stature not\ninferior to our own, and many thousand years ago they appear to have\nbeen still larger.\u0094\n\n\u0093I understand that,\u0094 said I, \u0093because Frogs this enormous are, according\nto our eminent geologists, who perhaps saw them in dreams, said to have\nbeen distinguished inhabitants of the upper world before the Deluge; and\nsuch Frogs are exactly the creatures likely to have flourished in the\nlakes and morasses of your subterranean regions. But pray, proceed.\u0094\n\n\u0093In the Wrangling Period of History, whatever one sage asserted another\nsage was sure to contradict. In fact, it was a maxim in that age, that\nthe human reason could only be sustained aloft by being tossed to and\nfro in the perpetual motion of contradiction; and therefore another\nsect of philosophers maintained the doctrine that the An was not the\ndescendant of the Frog, but that the Frog was clearly the improved\ndevelopment of the An. The shape of the Frog, taken generally, was much\nmore symmetrical than that of the An; beside the beautiful conformation\nof its lower limbs, its flanks and shoulders the majority of the Ana in\nthat day were almost deformed, and certainly ill-shaped. Again, the Frog\nhad the power to live alike on land and in water--a mighty privilege,\npartaking of a spiritual essence denied to the An, since the disuse\nof his swimming-bladder clearly proves his degeneration from a higher\ndevelopment of species. Again, the earlier races of the Ana seem to\nhave been covered with hair, and, even to a comparatively recent date,\nhirsute bushes deformed the very faces of our ancestors, spreading wild\nover their cheeks and chins, as similar bushes, my poor Tish, spread\nwild over yours. But the object of the higher races of the Ana through\ncountless generations has been to erase all vestige of connection with\nhairy vertebrata, and they have gradually eliminated that debasing\ncapillary excrement by the law of sexual selection; the Gy-ei naturally\npreferring youth or the beauty of smooth faces. But the degree of the\nFrog in the scale of the vertebrata is shown in this, that he has\nno hair at all, not even on his head. He was born to that hairless\nperfection which the most beautiful of the Ana, despite the culture of\nincalculable ages, have not yet attained. The wonderful complication and\ndelicacy of a Frog\u0092s nervous system and arterial circulation were shown\nby this school to be more susceptible of enjoyment than our inferior, or\nat least simpler, physical frame allows us to be. The examination of\na Frog\u0092s hand, if I may use that expression, accounted for its keener\nsusceptibility to love, and to social life in general. In fact,\ngregarious and amatory as are the Ana, Frogs are still more so. In\nshort, these two schools raged against each other; one asserting the An\nto be the perfected type of the Frog; the other that the Frog was the\nhighest development of the An. The moralists were divided in\nopinion with the naturalists, but the bulk of them sided with the\nFrog-preference school. They said, with much plausibility, that in moral\nconduct (viz., in the adherence to rules best adapted to the health and\nwelfare of the individual and the community) there could be no doubt\nof the vast superiority of the Frog. All history showed the wholesale\nimmorality of the human race, the complete disregard, even by the\nmost renowned amongst them, of the laws which they acknowledged to be\nessential to their own and the general happiness and wellbeing. But the\nseverest critic of the Frog race could not detect in their manners a\nsingle aberration from the moral law tacitly recognised by themselves.\nAnd what, after all, can be the profit of civilisation if superiority in\nmoral conduct be not the aim for which it strives, and the test by which\nits progress should be judged?\n\n\u0093In fine, the adherents of this theory presumed that in some remote\nperiod the Frog race had been the improved development of the Human; but\nthat, from some causes which defied rational conjecture, they had not\nmaintained their original position in the scale of nature; while the\nAna, though of inferior organisation, had, by dint less of their virtues\nthan their vices, such as ferocity and cunning, gradually acquired\nascendancy, much as among the human race itself tribes utterly barbarous\nhave, by superiority in similar vices, utterly destroyed or reduced\ninto insignificance tribes originally excelling them in mental gifts\nand culture. Unhappily these disputes became involved with the religious\nnotions of that age; and as society was then administered under the\ngovernment of the Koom-Posh, who, being the most ignorant, were of\ncourse the most inflammable class--the multitude took the whole question\nout of the hands of the philosophers; political chiefs saw that the\nFrog dispute, so taken up by the populace, could become a most valuable\ninstrument of their ambition; and for not less than one thousand years\nwar and massacre prevailed, during which period the philosophers on both\nsides were butchered, and the government of Koom-Posh itself was happily\nbrought to an end by the ascendancy of a family that clearly established\nits descent from the aboriginal tadpole, and furnished despotic rulers\nto the various nations of the Ana. These despots finally disappeared, at\nleast from our communities, as the discovery of vril led to the tranquil\ninstitutions under which flourish all the races of the Vril-ya.\u0094\n\n\u0093And do no wranglers or philosophers now exist to revive the dispute; or\ndo they all recognise the origin of your race in the tadpole?\u0094\n\n\u0093Nay, such disputes,\u0094 said Zee, with a lofty smile, \u0093belong to the\nPah-bodh of the dark ages, and now only serve for the amusement of\ninfants. When we know the elements out of which our bodies are composed,\nelements in common to the humblest vegetable plants, can it signify\nwhether the All-Wise combined those elements out of one form more than\nanother, in order to create that in which He has placed the capacity to\nreceive the idea of Himself, and all the varied grandeurs of intellect\nto which that idea gives birth? The An in reality commenced to exist\nas An with the donation of that capacity, and, with that capacity, the\nsense to acknowledge that, however through the countless ages his race\nmay improve in wisdom, it can never combine the elements at its command\ninto the form of a tadpole.\u0094\n\n\u0093You speak well, Zee,\u0094 said Aph-Lin; \u0093and it is enough for us shortlived\nmortals to feel a reasonable assurance that whether the origin of the\nAn was a tadpole or not, he is no more likely to become a tadpole again\nthan the institutions of the Vril-ya are likely to relapse into the\nheaving quagmire and certain strife-rot of a Koom-Posh.\u0094\n\n\nChapter XVII.\n\n\nThe Vril-ya, being excluded from all sight of the heavenly bodies, and\nhaving no other difference between night and day than that which they\ndeem it convenient to make for themselves,--do not, of course, arrive at\ntheir divisions of time by the same process that we do; but I found it\neasy by the aid of my watch, which I luckily had about me, to compute\ntheir time with great nicety. I reserve for a future work on the science\nand literature of the Vril-ya, should I live to complete it, all details\nas to the manner in which they arrive at their rotation of time; and\ncontent myself here with saying, that in point of duration, their year\ndiffers very slightly from ours, but that the divisions of their year\nare by no means the same. Their day, (including what we call night)\nconsists of twenty hours of our time, instead of twenty-four, and of\ncourse their year comprises the correspondent increase in the number of\ndays by which it is summed up. They subdivide the twenty hours of their\nday thus--eight hours,* called the \u0093Silent Hours,\u0094 for repose; eight\nhours, called the \u0093Earnest Time,\u0094 for the pursuits and occupations of\nlife; and four hours called the \u0093Easy Time\u0094 (with which what I may term\ntheir day closes), allotted to festivities, sport, recreation, or family\nconverse, according to their several tastes and inclinations.\n\n* For the sake of convenience, I adopt the word hours, days, years,\n&c., in any general reference to subdivisions of time among the Vril-ya;\nthose terms but loosely corresponding, however, with such subdivisions.\n\nBut, in truth, out of doors there is no night. They maintain, both\nin the streets and in the surrounding country, to the limits of their\nterritory, the same degree of light at all hours. Only, within doors,\nthey lower it to a soft twilight during the Silent Hours. They have\na great horror of perfect darkness, and their lights are never wholly\nextinguished. On occasions of festivity they continue the duration of\nfull light, but equally keep note of the distinction between night and\nday, by mechanical contrivances which answer the purpose of our clocks\nand watches. They are very fond of music; and it is by music that these\nchronometers strike the principal division of time. At every one\nof their hours, during their day, the sounds coming from all the\ntime-pieces in their public buildings, and caught up, as it were, by\nthose of houses or hamlets scattered amidst the landscapes without the\ncity, have an effect singularly sweet, and yet singularly solemn.\nBut during the Silent Hours these sounds are so subdued as to be only\nfaintly heard by a waking ear. They have no change of seasons, and, at\nleast on the territory of this tribe, the atmosphere seemed to me very\nequable, warm as that of an Italian summer, and humid rather than dry;\nin the forenoon usually very still, but at times invaded by strong\nblasts from the rocks that made the borders of their domain. But time\nis the same to them for sowing or reaping as in the Golden Isles of the\nancient poets. At the same moment you see the younger plants in blade or\nbud, the older in ear or fruit. All fruit-bearing plants, however, after\nfruitage, either shed or change the colour of their leaves. But that\nwhich interested me most in reckoning up their divisions of time was the\nascertainment of the average duration of life amongst them. I found on\nminute inquiry that this very considerably exceeded the term allotted to\nus on the upper earth. What seventy years are to us, one hundred\nyears are to them. Nor is this the only advantage they have over us in\nlongevity, for as few among us attain to the age of seventy, so, on the\ncontrary, few among them die before the age of one hundred; and they\nenjoy a general degree of health and vigour which makes life itself a\nblessing even to the last. Various causes contribute to this result:\nthe absence of all alcoholic stimulants; temperance in food; more\nespecially, perhaps, a serenity of mind undisturbed by anxious\noccupations and eager passions. They are not tormented by our avarice\nor our ambition; they appear perfectly indifferent even to the desire of\nfame; they are capable of great affection, but their love shows\nitself in a tender and cheerful complaisance, and, while forming their\nhappiness, seems rarely, if ever, to constitute their woe. As the Gy is\nsure only to marry where she herself fixes her choice, and as here, not\nless than above ground, it is the female on whom the happiness of home\ndepends; so the Gy, having chosen the mate she prefers to all others, is\nlenient to his faults, consults his humours, and does her best to secure\nhis attachment. The death of a beloved one is of course with them, as\nwith us, a cause for sorrow; but not only is death with them so much\nmore rare before that age in which it becomes a release, but when it\ndoes occur the survivor takes much more consolation than, I am afraid,\nthe generality of us do, in the certainty of reunion in another and yet\nhappier life.\n\nAll these causes, then, concur to their healthful and enjoyable\nlongevity, though, no doubt, much also must be owing to hereditary\norganisation. According to their records, however, in those earlier\nstages of their society when they lived in communities resembling ours,\nagitated by fierce competition, their lives were considerably shorter,\nand their maladies more numerous and grave. They themselves say that\nthe duration of life, too, has increased, and is still on the increase,\nsince their discovery of the invigorating and medicinal properties of\nvril, applied for remedial purposes. They have few professional and\nregular practitioners of medicine, and these are chiefly Gy-ei, who,\nespecially if widowed and childless, find great delight in the healing\nart, and even undertake surgical operations in those cases required by\naccident, or, more rarely, by disease.\n\nThey have their diversions and entertainments, and, during the Easy\nTime of their day, they are wont to assemble in great numbers for those\nwinged sports in the air which I have already described. They have also\npublic halls for music, and even theatres, at which are performed\npieces that appeared to me somewhat to resemble the plays of the\nChinese--dramas that are thrown back into distant times for their events\nand personages, in which all classic unities are outrageously violated,\nand the hero, in once scene a child, in the next is an old man, and so\nforth. These plays are of very ancient composition, and their stories\ncast in remote times. They appeared to me very dull, on the whole,\nbut were relieved by startling mechanical contrivances, and a kind of\nfarcical broad humour, and detached passages of great vigour and power\nexpressed in language highly poetical, but somewhat overcharged with\nmetaphor and trope. In fine, they seemed to me very much what the plays\nof Shakespeare seemed to a Parisian in the time of Louis XV., or perhaps\nto an Englishman in the reign of Charles II.\n\nThe audience, of which the Gy-ei constituted the chief portion, appeared\nto enjoy greatly the representation of these dramas, which, for so\nsedate and majestic a race of females, surprised me, till I observed\nthat all the performers were under the age of adolescence, and\nconjectured truly that the mothers and sisters came to please their\nchildren and brothers.\n\nI have said that these dramas are of great antiquity. No new plays,\nindeed no imaginative works sufficiently important to survive their\nimmediate day, appear to have been composed for several generations. In\nfact, though there is no lack of new publications, and they have even\nwhat may be called newspapers, these are chiefly devoted to mechanical\nscience, reports of new inventions, announcements respecting various\ndetails of business--in short, to practical matters. Sometimes a child\nwrites a little tale of adventure, or a young Gy vents her amorous hopes\nor fears in a poem; but these effusions are of very little merit,\nand are seldom read except by children and maiden Gy-ei. The most\ninteresting works of a purely literary character are those of\nexplorations and travels into other regions of this nether world,\nwhich are generally written by young emigrants, and are read with great\navidity by the relations and friends they have left behind.\n\nI could not help expressing to Aph-Lin my surprise that a community in\nwhich mechanical science had made so marvellous a progress, and in\nwhich intellectual civilisation had exhibited itself in realising\nthose objects for the happiness of the people, which the political\nphilosophers above ground had, after ages of struggle, pretty generally\nagreed to consider unattainable visions, should, nevertheless, be so\nwholly without a contemporaneous literature, despite the excellence\nto which culture had brought a language at once so rich and simple,\nvigourous and musical.\n\nMy host replied--\u0093Do you not perceive that a literature such as you mean\nwould be wholly incompatible with that perfection of social or political\nfelicity at which you do us the honour to think we have arrived? We have\nat last, after centuries of struggle, settled into a form of government\nwith which we are content, and in which, as we allow no differences of\nrank, and no honours are paid to administrators distinguishing them from\nothers, there is no stimulus given to individual ambition. No one would\nread works advocating theories that involved any political or social\nchange, and therefore no one writes them. If now and then an An feels\nhimself dissatisfied with our tranquil mode of life, he does not attack\nit; he goes away. Thus all that part of literature (and to judge by the\nancient books in our public libraries, it was once a very large part),\nwhich relates to speculative theories on society is become utterly\nextinct. Again, formerly there was a vast deal written respecting\nthe attributes and essence of the All-Good, and the arguments for and\nagainst a future state; but now we all recognise two facts, that there\nIS a Divine Being, and there IS a future state, and we all equally agree\nthat if we wrote our fingers to the bone, we could not throw any light\nupon the nature and conditions of that future state, or quicken our\napprehensions of the attributes and essence of that Divine Being. Thus\nanother part of literature has become also extinct, happily for our\nrace; for in the time when so much was written on subjects which no one\ncould determine, people seemed to live in a perpetual state of quarrel\nand contention. So, too, a vast part of our ancient literature consists\nof historical records of wars an revolutions during the times when the\nAna lived in large and turbulent societies, each seeking aggrandisement\nat the expense of the other. You see our serene mode of life now; such\nit has been for ages. We have no events to chronicle. What more of us\ncan be said than that, \u0091they were born, they were happy, they died?\u0092\nComing next to that part of literature which is more under the control\nof the imagination, such as what we call Glaubsila, or colloquially\n\u0091Glaubs,\u0092 and you call poetry, the reasons for its decline amongst us\nare abundantly obvious.\n\n\u0093We find, by referring to the great masterpieces in that department\nof literature which we all still read with pleasure, but of which none\nwould tolerate imitations, that they consist in the portraiture of\npassions which we no longer experience--ambition, vengeance, unhallowed\nlove, the thirst for warlike renown, and suchlike. The old poets lived\nin an atmosphere impregnated with these passions, and felt vividly what\nthey expressed glowingly. No one can express such passions now, for no\none can feel them, or meet with any sympathy in his readers if he did.\nAgain, the old poetry has a main element in its dissection of those\ncomplex mysteries of human character which conduce to abnormal vices and\ncrimes, or lead to signal and extraordinary virtues. But our society,\nhaving got rid of temptations to any prominent vices and crimes, has\nnecessarily rendered the moral average so equal, that there are no\nvery salient virtues. Without its ancient food of strong passions, vast\ncrimes, heroic excellences, poetry therefore is, if not actually starved\nto death, reduced to a very meagre diet. There is still the poetry of\ndescription--description of rocks, and trees, and waters, and common\nhousehold life; and our young Gy-ei weave much of this insipid kind of\ncomposition into their love verses.\u0094\n\n\u0093Such poetry,\u0094 said I, \u0093might surely be made very charming; and we have\ncritics amongst us who consider it a higher kind than that which depicts\nthe crimes, or analyses the passions, of man. At all events, poetry of\nthe inspired kind you mention is a poetry that nowadays commands more\nreaders than any other among the people I have left above ground.\u0094\n\n\u0093Possibly; but then I suppose the writers take great pains with the\nlanguage they employ, and devote themselves to the culture and polish of\nwords and rhythms of an art?\u0094\n\n\u0093Certainly they do: all great poets do that. Though the gift of poetry\nmay be inborn, the gift requires as much care to make it available as a\nblock of metal does to be made into one of your engines.\u0094\n\n\u0093And doubtless your poets have some incentive to bestow all those pains\nupon such verbal prettinesses?\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, I presume their instinct of song would make them sing as the bird\ndoes; but to cultivate the song into verbal or artificial prettiness,\nprobably does need an inducement from without, and our poets find it in\nthe love of fame--perhaps, now and then, in the want of money.\u0094\n\n\u0093Precisely so. But in our society we attach fame to nothing which man,\nin that moment of his duration which is called \u0091life,\u0092 can perform. We\nshould soon lose that equality which constitutes the felicitous essence\nof our commonwealth if we selected any individual for pre-eminent\npraise: pre-eminent praise would confer pre-eminent power, and the\nmoment it were given, evil passions, now dormant, would awake: other\nmen would immediately covet praise, then would arise envy, and with envy\nhate, and with hate calumny and persecution. Our history tells us that\nmost of the poets and most of the writers who, in the old time, were\nfavoured with the greatest praise, were also assailed by the greatest\nvituperation, and even, on the whole, rendered very unhappy, partly\nby the attacks of jealous rivals, partly by the diseased mental\nconstitution which an acquired sensitiveness to praise and to blame\ntends to engender. As for the stimulus of want; in the first place, no\nman in our community knows the goad of poverty; and, secondly, if he\ndid, almost every occupation would be more lucrative than writing.\n\n\u0093Our public libraries contain all the books of the past which time has\npreserved; those books, for the reasons above stated, are infinitely\nbetter than any can write nowadays, and they are open to all to read\nwithout cost. We are not such fools as to pay for reading inferior\nbooks, when we can read superior books for nothing.\u0094\n\n\u0093With us, novelty has an attraction; and a new book, if bad, is read\nwhen an old book, though good, is neglected.\u0094\n\n\u0093Novelty, to barbarous states of society struggling in despair for\nsomething better, has no doubt an attraction, denied to us, who see\nnothing to gain in novelties; but after all, it is observed by one of\nour great authors four thousand years ago, that \u0091he who studies old\nbooks will always find in them something new, and he who reads new books\nwill always find in them something old.\u0092 But to return to the question\nyou have raised, there being then amongst us no stimulus to painstaking\nlabour, whether in desire of fame or in pressure of want, such as have\nthe poetic temperament, no doubt vent it in song, as you say the bird\nsings; but for lack of elaborate culture it fails of an audience,\nand, failing of an audience, dies out, of itself, amidst the ordinary\navocations of life.\u0094\n\n\u0093But how is it that these discouragements to the cultivation of\nliterature do not operate against that of science?\u0094\n\n\u0093Your question amazes me. The motive to science is the love of truth\napart from all consideration of fame, and science with us too is devoted\nalmost solely to practical uses, essential to our social conversation\nand the comforts of our daily life. No fame is asked by the inventor,\nand none is given to him; he enjoys an occupation congenial to his\ntastes, and needing no wear and tear of the passions. Man must have\nexercise for his mind as well as body; and continuous exercise, rather\nthan violent, is best for both. Our most ingenious cultivators of\nscience are, as a general rule, the longest lived and the most free from\ndisease. Painting is an amusement to many, but the art is not what it\nwas in former times, when the great painters in our various communities\nvied with each other for the prize of a golden crown, which gave them a\nsocial rank equal to that of the kings under whom they lived. You\nwill thus doubtless have observed in our archaeological department how\nsuperior in point of art the pictures were several thousand years ago.\nPerhaps it is because music is, in reality, more allied to science than\nit is to poetry, that, of all the pleasurable arts, music is that which\nflourishes the most amongst us. Still, even in music the absence of\nstimulus in praise or fame has served to prevent any great superiority\nof one individual over another; and we rather excel in choral music,\nwith the aid of our vast mechanical instruments, in which we make great\nuse of the agency of water,* than in single performers.\u0094\n\n* This may remind the student of Nero\u0092s invention of a musical machine,\nby which water was made to perform the part of an orchestra, and on\nwhich he was employed when the conspiracy against him broke out.\n\n\u0093We have had scarcely any original composer for some ages. Our favorite\nairs are very ancient in substance, but have admitted many complicated\nvariations by inferior, though ingenious, musicians.\u0094\n\n\u0093Are there no political societies among the Ana which are animated\nby those passions, subjected to those crimes, and admitting those\ndisparities in condition, in intellect, and in morality, which the state\nof your tribe, or indeed of the Vril-ya generally, has left behind in\nits progress to perfection? If so, among such societies perhaps Poetry\nand her sister arts still continue to be honoured and to improve?\u0094\n\n\u0093There are such societies in remote regions, but we do not admit them\nwithin the pale of civilised communities; we scarcely even give them the\nname of Ana, and certainly not that of Vril-ya. They are savages, living\nchiefly in that low stage of being, Koom-Posh, tending necessarily to\nits own hideous dissolution in Glek-Nas. Their wretched existence is\npassed in perpetual contest and perpetual change. When they do not fight\nwith their neighbours, they fight among themselves. They are divided\ninto sections, which abuse, plunder, and sometimes murder each\nother, and on the most frivolous points of difference that would be\nunintelligible to us if we had not read history, and seen that we too\nhave passed through the same early state of ignorance and barbarism. Any\ntrifle is sufficient to set them together by the ears. They pretend to\nbe all equals, and the more they have struggled to be so, by removing\nold distinctions, and starting afresh, the more glaring and intolerable\nthe disparity becomes, because nothing in hereditary affections and\nassociations is left to soften the one naked distinction between the\nmany who have nothing and the few who have much. Of course the many hate\nthe few, but without the few they could not live. The many are always\nassailing the few; sometimes they exterminate the few; but as soon as\nthey have done so, a new few starts out of the many, and is harder\nto deal with than the old few. For where societies are large, and\ncompetition to have something is the predominant fever, there must be\nalways many losers and few gainers. In short, they are savages groping\ntheir way in the dark towards some gleam of light, and would demand our\ncommiseration for their infirmities, if, like all savages, they did not\nprovoke their own destruction by their arrogance and cruelty. Can you\nimagine that creatures of this kind, armed only with such miserable\nweapons as you may see in our museum of antiquities, clumsy iron tubes\ncharged with saltpetre, have more than once threatened with destruction\na tribe of the Vril-ya, which dwells nearest to them, because they say\nthey have thirty millions of population--and that tribe may have fifty\nthousand--if the latter do not accept their notions of Soc-Sec (money\ngetting) on some trading principles which they have the impudence to\ncall \u0091a law of civilisation\u0092?\u0094\n\n\u0093But thirty millions of population are formidable odds against fifty\nthousand!\u0094\n\nMy host stared at me astonished. \u0093Stranger,\u0094 said he, \u0093you could not\nhave heard me say that this threatened tribe belongs to the Vril-ya; and\nit only waits for these savages to declare war, in order to commission\nsome half-a-dozen small children to sweep away their whole population.\u0094\n\nAt these words I felt a thrill of horror, recognising much more affinity\nwith \u0093the savages\u0094 than I did with the Vril-ya, and remembering all I\nhad said in praise of the glorious American institutions, which Aph-Lin\nstigmatised as Koom-Posh. Recovering my self-possession, I asked\nif there were modes of transit by which I could safely visit this\ntemerarious and remote people.\n\n\u0093You can travel with safety, by vril agency, either along the ground or\namid the air, throughout all the range of the communities with which\nwe are allied and akin; but I cannot vouch for your safety in barbarous\nnations governed by different laws from ours; nations, indeed, so\nbenighted, that there are among them large numbers who actually live by\nstealing from each other, and one could not with safety in the Silent\nHours even leave the doors of one\u0092s own house open.\u0094\n\nHere our conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Taee, who came\nto inform us that he, having been deputed to discover and destroy the\nenormous reptile which I had seen on my first arrival, had been on the\nwatch for it ever since his visit to me, and had began to suspect that\nmy eyes had deceived me, or that the creature had made its way through\nthe cavities within the rocks to the wild regions in which dwelt its\nkindred race,--when it gave evidences of its whereabouts by a great\ndevastation of the herbage bordering one of the lakes. \u0093And,\u0094 said Taee,\n\u0093I feel sure that within that lake it is now hiding. So,\u0094 (turning to\nme) \u0093I thought it might amuse you to accompany me to see the way we\ndestroy such unpleasant visitors.\u0094 As I looked at the face of the young\nchild, and called to mind the enormous size of the creature he proposed\nto exterminate, I felt myself shudder with fear for him, and perhaps\nfear for myself, if I accompanied him in such a chase. But my curiosity\nto witness the destructive effects of the boasted vril, and my\nunwillingness to lower myself in the eyes of an infant by betraying\napprehensions of personal safety, prevailed over my first impulse.\nAccordingly, I thanked Taee for his courteous consideration for my\namusement, and professed my willingness to set out with him on so\ndiverting an enterprise.\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII.\n\n\nAs Taee and myself, on quitting the town, and leaving to the left the\nmain road which led to it, struck into the fields, the strange and\nsolemn beauty of the landscape, lighted up, by numberless lamps, to the\nverge of the horizon, fascinated my eyes, and rendered me for some time\nan inattentive listener to the talk of my companion.\n\nAlong our way various operations of agriculture were being carried on by\nmachinery, the forms of which were new to me, and for the most part very\ngraceful; for among these people art being so cultivated for the sake\nof mere utility, exhibits itself in adorning or refining the shapes of\nuseful objects. Precious metals and gems are so profuse among them, that\nthey are lavished on things devoted to purposes the most commonplace;\nand their love of utility leads them to beautify its tools, and quickens\ntheir imagination in a way unknown to themselves.\n\nIn all service, whether in or out of doors, they make great use\nof automaton figures, which are so ingenious, and so pliant to the\noperations of vril, that they actually seem gifted with reason. It\nwas scarcely possible to distinguish the figures I beheld, apparently\nguiding or superintending the rapid movements of vast engines, from\nhuman forms endowed with thought.\n\nBy degrees, as we continued to walk on, my attention became roused by\nthe lively and acute remarks of my companion. The intelligence of the\nchildren among this race is marvellously precocious, perhaps from the\nhabit of having intrusted to them, at so early an age, the toils and\nresponsibilities of middle age. Indeed, in conversing with Taee, I felt\nas if talking with some superior and observant man of my own years. I\nasked him if he could form any estimate of the number of communities\ninto which the race of the Vril-ya is subdivided.\n\n\u0093Not exactly,\u0094 he said, \u0093because they multiply, of course, every year as\nthe surplus of each community is drafted off. But I heard my father say\nthat, according to the last report, there were a million and a half of\ncommunities speaking our language, and adopting our institutions and\nforms of life and government; but, I believe, with some differences,\nabout which you had better ask Zee. She knows more than most of the Ana\ndo. An An cares less for things that do not concern him than a Gy does;\nthe Gy-ei are inquisitive creatures.\u0094\n\n\u0093Does each community restrict itself to the same number of families or\namount of population that you do?\u0094\n\n\u0093No; some have much smaller populations, some have larger--varying\naccording to the extent of the country they appropriate, or to the\ndegree of excellence to which they have brought their machinery. Each\ncommunity sets its own limit according to circumstances, taking care\nalways that there shall never arise any class of poor by the pressure of\npopulation upon the productive powers of the domain; and that no\nstate shall be too large for a government resembling that of a\nsingle well-ordered family. I imagine that no vril community exceeds\nthirty-thousand households. But, as a general rule, the smaller\nthe community, provided there be hands enough to do justice to the\ncapacities of the territory it occupies, the richer each individual is,\nand the larger the sum contributed to the general treasury,--above all,\nthe happier and the more tranquil is the whole political body, and the\nmore perfect the products of its industry. The state which all tribes of\nthe Vril-ya acknowledge to be the highest in civilisation, and which\nhas brought the vril force to its fullest development, is perhaps the\nsmallest. It limits itself to four thousand families; but every inch of\nits territory is cultivated to the utmost perfection of garden ground;\nits machinery excels that of every other tribe, and there is no\nproduct of its industry in any department which is not sought for, at\nextraordinary prices, by each community of our race. All our tribes make\nthis state their model, considering that we should reach the highest\nstate of civilisation allowed to mortals if we could unite the greatest\ndegree of happiness with the highest degree of intellectual achievement;\nand it is clear that the smaller the society the less difficult that\nwill be. Ours is too large for it.\u0094\n\nThis reply set me thinking. I reminded myself of that little state of\nAthens, with only twenty thousand free citizens, and which to this\nday our mightiest nations regard as the supreme guide and model in all\ndepartments of intellect. But then Athens permitted fierce rivalry and\nperpetual change, and was certainly not happy. Rousing myself from the\nreverie into which these reflections had plunged me, I brought back our\ntalk to the subjects connected with emigration.\n\n\u0093But,\u0094 said I, \u0093when, I suppose yearly, a certain number among you agree\nto quit home and found a new community elsewhere, they must necessarily\nbe very few, and scarcely sufficient, even with the help of the machines\nthey take with them, to clear the ground, and build towns, and form a\ncivilised state with the comforts and luxuries in which they had been\nreared.\u0094\n\n\u0093You mistake. All the tribes of the Vril-ya are in constant\ncommunication with each other, and settle amongst themselves each\nyear what proportion of one community will unite with the emigrants of\nanother, so as to form a state of sufficient size; and the place for\nemigration is agreed upon at least a year before, and pioneers sent from\neach state to level rocks, and embank waters, and construct houses; so\nthat when the emigrants at last go, they find a city already made, and a\ncountry around it at least partially cleared. Our hardy life as children\nmake us take cheerfully to travel and adventure. I mean to emigrate\nmyself when of age.\u0094\n\n\u0093Do the emigrants always select places hitherto uninhabited and barren?\u0094\n\n\u0093As yet generally, because it is our rule never to destroy except\nwhen necessary to our well-being. Of course, we cannot settle in lands\nalready occupied by the Vril-ya; and if we take the cultivated lands\nof the other races of Ana, we must utterly destroy the previous\ninhabitants. Sometimes, as it is, we take waste spots, and find that\na troublesome, quarrelsome race of Ana, especially if under the\nadministration of Koom-Posh or Glek-Nas, resents our vicinity, and picks\na quarrel with us; then, of course, as menacing our welfare, we destroy\nit: there is no coming to terms of peace with a race so idiotic that\nit is always changing the form of government which represents it.\nKoom-Posh,\u0094 said the child, emphatically, \u0093is bad enough, still it has\nbrains, though at the back of its head, and is not without a heart; but\nin Glek-Nas the brain and heart of the creatures disappear, and they\nbecome all jaws, claws, and belly.\u0094 \u0093You express yourself strongly.\nAllow me to inform you that I myself, and I am proud to say it, am the\ncitizen of a Koom-Posh.\u0094\n\n\u0093I no longer,\u0094 answered Taee, \u0093wonder to see you here so far from your\nhome. What was the condition of your native community before it became a\nKoom-Posh?\u0094\n\n\u0093A settlement of emigrants--like those settlements which your tribe\nsends forth--but so far unlike your settlements, that it was dependent\non the state from which it came. It shook off that yoke, and, crowned\nwith eternal glory, became a Koom-Posh.\u0094\n\n\u0093Eternal glory! How long has the Koom-Posh lasted?\u0094\n\n\u0093About 100 years.\u0094\n\n\u0093The length of an An\u0092s life--a very young community. In much less than\nanother 100 years your Koom-Posh will be a Glek-Nas.\u0094\n\n\u0093Nay, the oldest states in the world I come from, have such faith in its\nduration, that they are all gradually shaping their institutions so\nas to melt into ours, and their most thoughtful politicians say that,\nwhether they like it or not, the inevitable tendency of these old states\nis towards Koom-Posh-erie.\u0094\n\n\u0093The old states?\u0094\n\n\u0093Yes, the old states.\u0094\n\n\u0093With populations very small in proportion to the area of productive\nland?\u0094\n\n\u0093On the contrary, with populations very large in proportion to that\narea.\u0094\n\n\u0093I see! old states indeed!--so old as to become drivelling if they don\u0092t\npack off that surplus population as we do ours--very old states!--very,\nvery old! Pray, Tish, do you think it wise for very old men to try to\nturn head-over-heels as very young children do? And if you ask them why\nthey attempted such antics, should you not laugh if they answered that\nby imitating very young children they could become very young children\nthemselves? Ancient history abounds with instances of this sort a great\nmany thousand years ago--and in every instance a very old state that\nplayed at Koom-Posh soon tumbled into Glek-Nas. Then, in horror of its\nown self, it cried out for a master, as an old man in his dotage cries\nout for a nurse; and after a succession of masters or nurses, more or\nless long, that very old state died out of history. A very old state\nattempting Koom-Posh-erie is like a very old man who pulls down the\nhouse to which he has been accustomed, but he has so exhausted his\nvigour in pulling down, that all he can do in the way of rebuilding is\nto run up a crazy hut, in which himself and his successors whine out,\n\u0091How the wind blows! How the walls shake!\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093My dear Taee, I make all excuse for your unenlightened prejudices,\nwhich every schoolboy educated in a Koom-Posh could easily controvert,\nthough he might not be so precociously learned in ancient history as you\nappear to be.\u0094\n\n\u0093I learned! not a bit of it. But would a schoolboy, educated in your\nKoom-Posh, ask his great-great-grandfather or great-great-grandmother\nto stand on his or her head with the feet uppermost? And if the poor old\nfolks hesitated--say, \u0091What do you fear?--see how I do it!\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093Taee, I disdain to argue with a child of your age. I repeat, I make\nallowances for your want of that culture which a Koom-Posh alone can\nbestow.\u0094\n\n\u0093I, in my turn,\u0094 answered Taee, with an air of the suave but lofty good\nbreeding which characterises his race, \u0093not only make allowances for\nyou as not educated among the Vril-ya, but I entreat you to vouchsafe me\nyour pardon for the insufficient respect to the habits and opinions of\nso amiable a Tish!\u0094\n\nI ought before to have observed that I was commonly called Tish by my\nhost and his family, as being a polite and indeed a pet name, literally\nsignifying a small barbarian; the children apply it endearingly to the\ntame species of Frog which they keep in their gardens.\n\nWe had now reached the banks of a lake, and Taee here paused to point\nout to me the ravages made in fields skirting it. \u0093The enemy certainly\nlies within these waters,\u0094 said Taee. \u0093Observe what shoals of fish are\ncrowded together at the margin. Even the great fishes with the small\nones, who are their habitual prey and who generally shun them, all\nforget their instincts in the presence of a common destroyer. This\nreptile certainly must belong to the class of Krek-a, which are more\ndevouring than any other, and are said to be among the few surviving\nspecies of the world\u0092s dreadest inhabitants before the Ana were created.\nThe appetite of a Krek is insatiable--it feeds alike upon vegetable and\nanimal life; but for the swift-footed creatures of the elk species it\nis too slow in its movements. Its favourite dainty is an An when it can\ncatch him unawares; and hence the Ana destroy it relentlessly whenever\nit enters their dominion. I have heard that when our forefathers first\ncleared this country, these monsters, and others like them, abounded,\nand, vril being then undiscovered, many of our race were devoured. It\nwas impossible to exterminate them wholly till that discovery which\nconstitutes the power and sustains the civilisation of our race. But\nafter the uses of vril became familiar to us, all creatures inimical\nto us were soon annihilated. Still, once a-year or so, one of these\nenormous creatures wanders from the unreclaimed and savage districts\nbeyond, and within my memory one has seized upon a young Gy who was\nbathing in this very lake. Had she been on land and armed with her\nstaff, it would not have dared even to show itself; for, like all savage\ncreatures, the reptile has a marvellous instinct, which warns it against\nthe bearer of the vril wand. How they teach their young to avoid him,\nthough seen for the first time, is one of those mysteries which you may\nask Zee to explain, for I cannot. The reptile in this instinct does but\nresemble our wild birds and animals, which will not come in reach of a\nman armed with a gun. When the electric wires were first put up,\npartridges struck against them in their flight, and fell down wounded.\nNo younger generations of partridges meet with a similar accident. So\nlong as I stand here, the monster will not stir from its lurking-place;\nbut we must now decoy it forth.\u0094\n\n\u0093Will that not be difficult?\u0094\n\n\u0093Not at all. Seat yourself yonder on that crag (about one hundred\nyards from the bank), while I retire to a distance. In a short time the\nreptile will catch sight or scent of you, and perceiving that you are no\nvril-bearer, will come forth to devour you. As soon as it is fairly out\nof the water, it becomes my prey.\u0094\n\n\u0093Do you mean to tell me that I am to be the decoy to that horrible\nmonster which could engulf me within its jaws in a second! I beg to\ndecline.\u0094\n\nThe child laughed. \u0093Fear nothing,\u0094 said he; \u0093only sit still.\u0094\n\nInstead of obeying the command, I made a bound, and was about to take\nfairly to my heels, when Taee touched me slightly on the shoulder, and,\nfixing his eyes steadily on mine, I was rooted to the spot. All power of\nvolition left me. Submissive to the infant\u0092s gesture, I followed him\nto the crag he had indicated, and seated myself there in silence. Most\nreaders have seen something of the effects of electro-biology, whether\ngenuine or spurious. No professor of that doubtful craft had ever been\nable to influence a thought or a movement of mine, but I was a mere\nmachine at the will of this terrible child. Meanwhile he expanded his\nwings, soared aloft, and alighted amidst a copse at the brow of a hill\nat some distance.\n\nI was alone; and turning my eyes with an indescribable sensation of\nhorror towards the lake, I kept them fixed on its water, spell-bound. It\nmight be ten or fifteen minutes, to me it seemed ages, before the still\nsurface, gleaming under the lamplight, began to be agitated towards\nthe centre. At the same time the shoals of fish near the margin evinced\ntheir sense of the enemy\u0092s approach by splash and leap and bubbling\ncircle. I could detect their hurried flight hither and thither, some\neven casting themselves ashore. A long, dark, undulous furrow came\nmoving along the waters, nearer and nearer, till the vast head of the\nreptile emerged--its jaws bristling with fangs, and its dull eyes fixing\nthemselves hungrily on the spot where I sat motionless. And now its fore\nfeet were on the strand--now its enormous breast, scaled on either\nside as in armour, in the centre showing its corrugated skin of a dull\nvenomous yellow; and now its whole length was on the land, a hundred\nfeet or more from the jaw to the tail. Another stride of those ghastly\nfeet would have brought it to the spot where I sat. There was but a\nmoment between me and this grim form of death, when what seemed a flash\nof lightning shot through the air, smote, and, for a space of time\nbriefer than that in which a man can draw his breath, enveloped\nthe monster; and then, as the flash vanished, there lay before me a\nblackened, charred, smouldering mass, a something gigantic, but of which\neven the outlines of form were burned away, and rapidly crumbling into\ndust and ashes. I remained still seated, still speechless, ice-cold with\na new sensation of dread; what had been horror was now awe.\n\nI felt the child\u0092s hand on my head--fear left me--the spell was\nbroken--I rose up. \u0093You see with what ease the Vril-ya destroy their\nenemies,\u0094 said Taee; and then, moving towards the bank, he contemplated\nthe smouldering relics of the monster, and said quietly, \u0093I have\ndestroyed larger creatures, but none with so much pleasure. Yes, it IS\na Krek; what suffering it must have inflicted while it lived!\u0094 Then he\ntook up the poor fishes that had flung themselves ashore, and restored\nthem mercifully to their native element.\n\n\n\nChapter XIX.\n\n\nAs we walked back to the town, Taee took a new and circuitous way,\nin order to show me what, to use a familiar term, I will call the\n\u0091Station,\u0092 from which emigrants or travellers to other communities\ncommence their journeys. I had, on a former occasion, expressed a wish\nto see their vehicles. These I found to be of two kinds, one for land\njourneys, one for aerial voyages: the former were of all sizes and\nforms, some not larger than an ordinary carriage, some movable houses of\none story and containing several rooms, furnished according to the ideas\nof comfort or luxury which are entertained by the Vril-ya. The aerial\nvehicles were of light substances, not the least resembling our\nballoons, but rather our boats and pleasure-vessels, with helm and\nrudder, with large wings or paddles, and a central machine worked by\nvril. All the vehicles both for land or air were indeed worked by that\npotent and mysterious agency.\n\nI saw a convoy set out on its journey, but it had few passengers,\ncontaining chiefly articles of merchandise, and was bound to a\nneighbouring community; for among all the tribes of the Vril-ya there\nis considerable commercial interchange. I may here observe, that their\nmoney currency does not consist of the precious metals, which are too\ncommon among them for that purpose. The smaller coins in ordinary use\nare manufactured from a peculiar fossil shell, the comparatively scarce\nremnant of some very early deluge, or other convulsion of nature, by\nwhich a species has become extinct. It is minute, and flat as an oyster,\nand takes a jewel-like polish. This coinage circulates among all the\ntribes of the Vril-ya. Their larger transactions are carried on much\nlike ours, by bills of exchange, and thin metallic plates which answer\nthe purpose of our bank-notes.\n\nLet me take this occasion of adding that the taxation among the tribe I\nbecame acquainted with was very considerable, compared with the amount\nof population. But I never heard that any one grumbled at it, for it was\ndevoted to purposes of universal utility, and indeed necessary to the\ncivilisation of the tribe. The cost of lighting so large a range\nof country, of providing for emigration, of maintaining the public\nbuildings at which the various operations of national intellect were\ncarried on, from the first education of an infant to the departments in\nwhich the College of Sages were perpetually trying new experiments in\nmechanical science; all these involved the necessity for considerable\nstate funds. To these I must add an item that struck me as very\nsingular. I have said that all the human labour required by the state is\ncarried on by children up to the marriageable age. For this labour the\nstate pays, and at a rate immeasurably higher than our own remuneration\nto labour even in the United States. According to their theory, every\nchild, male or female, on attaining the marriageable age, and there\nterminating the period of labour, should have acquired enough for an\nindependent competence during life. As, no matter what the disparity of\nfortune in the parents, all the children must equally serve, so all\nare equally paid according to their several ages or the nature of their\nwork. Where the parents or friends choose to retain a child in their\nown service, they must pay into the public fund in the same ratio as the\nstate pays to the children it employs; and this sum is handed over to\nthe child when the period of service expires. This practice serves, no\ndoubt, to render the notion of social equality familiar and agreeable;\nand if it may be said that all the children form a democracy, no less\ntruly it may be said that all the adults form an aristocracy. The\nexquisite politeness and refinement of manners among the Vril-ya, the\ngenerosity of their sentiments, the absolute leisure they enjoy for\nfollowing out their own private pursuits, the amenities of their\ndomestic intercourse, in which they seem as members of one noble order\nthat can have no distrust of each other\u0092s word or deed, all combine to\nmake the Vril-ya the most perfect nobility which a political disciple\nof Plato or Sidney could conceive for the ideal of an aristocratic\nrepublic.\n\n\n\nChapter XX.\n\n\nFrom the date of the expedition with Taee which I have just narrated,\nthe child paid me frequent visits. He had taken a liking to me, which I\ncordially returned. Indeed, as he was not yet twelve years old, and\nhad not commenced the course of scientific studies with which childhood\ncloses in that country, my intellect was less inferior to his than to\nthat of the elder members of his race, especially of the Gy-ei, and most\nespecially of the accomplished Zee. The children of the Vril-ya,\nhaving upon their minds the weight of so many active duties and grave\nresponsibilities, are not generally mirthful; but Taee, with all\nhis wisdom, had much of the playful good-humour one often finds the\ncharacteristic of elderly men of genius. He felt that sort of pleasure\nin my society which a boy of a similar age in the upper world has in the\ncompany of a pet dog or monkey. It amused him to try and teach me the\nways of his people, as it amuses a nephew of mine to make his poodle\nwalk on his hind legs or jump through a hoop. I willingly lent myself to\nsuch experiments, but I never achieved the success of the poodle. I was\nvery much interested at first in the attempt to ply the wings which the\nyoungest of the Vril-ya use as nimbly and easily as ours do their legs\nand arms; but my efforts were attended with contusions serious enough to\nmake me abandon them in despair.\n\nThese wings, as I before said, are very large, reaching to the knee,\nand in repose thrown back so as to form a very graceful mantle. They are\ncomposed from the feathers of a gigantic bird that abounds in the rocky\nheights of the country--the colour mostly white, but sometimes with\nreddish streaks. They are fastened round the shoulders with light but\nstrong springs of steel; and, when expanded, the arms slide through\nloops for that purpose, forming, as it were, a stout central membrane.\nAs the arms are raised, a tubular lining beneath the vest or tunic\nbecomes, by mechanical contrivance inflated with air, increased or\ndiminished at will by the movement of the arms, and serving to buoy the\nwhole form as on bladders. The wings and the balloon-like apparatus are\nhighly charged with vril; and when the body is thus wafted upward, it\nseems to become singularly lightened of its weight. I found it easy\nenough to soar from the ground; indeed, when the wings were spread it\nwas scarcely possible not to soar, but then came the difficulty and the\ndanger. I utterly failed in the power to use and direct the pinions,\nthough I am considered among my own race unusually alert and ready in\nbodily exercises, and am a very practiced swimmer. I could only make the\nmost confused and blundering efforts at flight. I was the servant of the\nwings; the wings were not my servants--they were beyond my control;\nand when by a violent strain of muscle, and, I must fairly own, in that\nabnormal strength which is given by excessive fright, I curbed their\ngyrations and brought them near to the body, it seemed as if I lost the\nsustaining power stored in them and the connecting bladders, as when the\nair is let out of a balloon, and found myself precipitated again to the\nearth; saved, indeed, by some spasmodic flutterings, from being dashed\nto pieces, but not saved from the bruises and the stun of a heavy fall.\nI would, however, have persevered in my attempts, but for the advice or\nthe commands of the scientific Zee, who had benevolently accompanied my\nflutterings, and, indeed, on the last occasion, flying just under me,\nreceived my form as it fell on her own expanded wings, and preserved\nme from breaking my head on the roof of the pyramid from which we had\nascended.\n\n\u0093I see,\u0094 she said, \u0093that your trials are in vain, not from the fault\nof the wings and their appurtenances, nor from any imperfectness and\nmalformation of your own corpuscular system, but from irremediable,\nbecause organic, defect in your power of volition. Learn that the\nconnection between the will and the agencies of that fluid which has\nbeen subjected to the control of the Vril-ya was never established by\nthe first discoverers, never achieved by a single generation; it has\ngone on increasing, like other properties of race, in proportion as it\nhas been uniformly transmitted from parent to child, so that, at last,\nit has become an instinct; and an infant An of our race wills to fly\nas intuitively and unconsciously as he wills to walk. He thus plies his\ninvented or artificial wings with as much safety as a bird plies those\nwith which it is born. I did not think sufficiently of this when I\nallowed you to try an experiment which allured me, for I have longed to\nhave in you a companion. I shall abandon the experiment now. Your life\nis becoming dear to me.\u0094 Herewith the Gy\u0092s voice and face softened, and\nI felt more seriously alarmed than I had been in my previous flights.\n\nNow that I am on the subject of wings, I ought not to omit mention of a\ncustom among the Gy-ei which seems to me very pretty and tender in the\nsentiment it implies. A Gy wears wings habitually when yet a virgin--she\njoins the Ana in their aerial sports--she adventures alone and afar into\nthe wilder regions of the sunless world: in the boldness and height of\nher soarings, not less than in the grace of her movements, she excels\nthe opposite sex. But, from the day of her marriage she wears wings\nno more, she suspends them with her own willing hand over the nuptial\ncouch, never to be resumed unless the marriage tie be severed by divorce\nor death.\n\nNow when Zee\u0092s voice and eyes thus softened--and at that softening I\nprophetically recoiled and shuddered--Taee, who had accompanied us in\nour flights, but who, child-like, had been much more amused with my\nawkwardness, than sympathising in my fears or aware of my danger,\nhovered over us, poised amidst spread wings, and hearing the endearing\nwords of the young Gy, laughed aloud. Said he, \u0093If the Tish cannot\nlearn the use of wings, you may still be his companion, Zee, for you can\nsuspend your own.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter XXI.\n\n\nI had for some time observed in my host\u0092s highly informed and powerfully\nproportioned daughter that kindly and protective sentiment which,\nwhether above the earth or below it, an all-wise Providence has bestowed\nupon the feminine division of the human race. But until very lately I\nhad ascribed it to that affection for \u0091pets\u0092 which a human female at\nevery age shares with a human child. I now became painfully aware that\nthe feeling with which Zee deigned to regard me was different from that\nwhich I had inspired in Taee. But this conviction gave me none of that\ncomplacent gratification which the vanity of man ordinarily conceives\nfrom a flattering appreciation of his personal merits on the part of\nthe fair sex; on the contrary, it inspired me with fear. Yet of all\nthe Gy-ei in the community, if Zee were perhaps the wisest and the\nstrongest, she was, by common repute, the gentlest, and she was\ncertainly the most popularly beloved. The desire to aid, to succour, to\nprotect, to comfort, to bless, seemed to pervade her whole being. Though\nthe complicated miseries that originate in penury and guilt are unknown\nto the social system of the Vril-ya, still, no sage had yet discovered\nin vril an agency which could banish sorrow from life; and wherever\namongst her people sorrow found its way, there Zee followed in the\nmission of comforter. Did some sister Gy fail to secure the love she\nsighed for? Zee sought her out, and brought all the resources of her\nlore, and all the consolations of her sympathy, to bear upon a grief\nthat so needs the solace of a confidant. In the rare cases, when grave\nillness seized upon childhood or youth, and the cases, less rare,\nwhen, in the hardy and adventurous probation of infants, some accident,\nattended with pain and injury occurred, Zee forsook her studies and\nher sports, and became the healer and nurse. Her favourite flights\nwere towards the extreme boundaries of the domain where children were\nstationed on guard against outbreaks of warring forces in nature, or the\ninvasions of devouring animals, so that she might warn them of any peril\nwhich her knowledge detected or foresaw, or be at hand if any harm had\nbefallen. Nay, even in the exercise of her scientific acquirements there\nwas a concurrent benevolence of purpose and will. Did she learn any\nnovelty in invention that would be useful to the practitioner of some\nspecial art or craft? she hastened to communicate and explain it. Was\nsome veteran sage of the College perplexed and wearied with the toil of\nan abstruse study? she would patiently devote herself to his aid, work\nout details for him, sustain his spirits with her hopeful smile, quicken\nhis wit with her luminous suggestion, be to him, as it were, his own\ngood genius made visible as the strengthener and inspirer. The same\ntenderness she exhibited to the inferior creatures. I have often known\nher bring home some sick and wounded animal, and tend and cherish it as\na mother would tend and cherish her stricken child. Many a time when I\nsat in the balcony, or hanging garden, on which my window opened, I have\nwatched her rising in the air on her radiant wings, and in a few moments\ngroups of infants below, catching sight of her, would soar upward with\njoyous sounds of greeting; clustering and sporting around her, so that\nshe seemed a very centre of innocent delight. When I have walked with\nher amidst the rocks and valleys without the city, the elk-deer would\nscent or see her from afar, come bounding up, eager for the caress\nof her hand, or follow her footsteps, till dismissed by some musical\nwhisper that the creature had learned to comprehend. It is the fashion\namong the virgin Gy-ei to wear on their foreheads a circlet, or coronet,\nwith gems resembling opals, arranged in four points or rays like stars.\nThese are lustreless in ordinary use, but if touched by the vril wand\nthey take a clear lambent flame, which illuminates, yet not burns. This\nserves as an ornament in their festivities, and as a lamp, if, in their\nwanderings beyond their artificial lights, they have to traverse the\ndark. There are times, when I have seen Zee\u0092s thoughtful majesty of face\nlighted up by this crowning halo, that I could scarcely believe her to\nbe a creature of mortal birth, and bent my head before her as the vision\nof a being among the celestial orders. But never once did my heart feel\nfor this lofty type of the noblest womanhood a sentiment of human love.\nIs it that, among the race I belong to, man\u0092s pride so far influences\nhis passions that woman loses to him her special charm of woman if he\nfeels her to be in all things eminently superior to himself? But by what\nstrange infatuation could this peerless daughter of a race which, in the\nsupremacy of its powers and the felicity of its conditions, ranked all\nother races in the category of barbarians, have deigned to honour me\nwith her preference? In personal qualifications, though I passed for\ngood-looking amongst the people I came from, the handsomest of my\ncountrymen might have seemed insignificant and homely beside the grand\nand serene type of beauty which characterised the aspect of the Vril-ya.\n\nThat novelty, the very difference between myself and those to whom Zee\nwas accustomed, might serve to bias her fancy was probable enough, and\nas the reader will see later, such a cause might suffice to account for\nthe predilection with which I was distinguished by a young Gy scarcely\nout of her childhood, and very inferior in all respects to Zee. But\nwhoever will consider those tender characteristics which I have just\nascribed to the daughter of Aph-Lin, may readily conceive that the main\ncause of my attraction to her was in her instinctive desire to cherish,\nto comfort, to protect, and, in protecting, to sustain and to exalt.\nThus, when I look back, I account for the only weakness unworthy of\nher lofty nature, which bowed the daughter of the Vril-ya to a woman\u0092s\naffection for one so inferior to herself as was her father\u0092s guest. But\nbe the cause what it may, the consciousness that I had inspired such\naffection thrilled me with awe--a moral awe of her very imperfections,\nof her mysterious powers, of the inseparable distinctions between her\nrace and my own; and with that awe, I must confess to my shame, there\ncombined the more material and ignoble dread of the perils to which her\npreference would expose me.\n\nUnder these anxious circumstances, fortunately, my conscience and sense\nof honour were free from reproach. It became clearly my duty, if Zee\u0092s\npreference continued manifest, to intimate it to my host, with, of\ncourse, all the delicacy which is ever to be preserved by a well-bred\nman in confiding to another any degree of favour by which one of the\nfair sex may condescend to distinguish him. Thus, at all events,\nI should be freed from responsibility or suspicion of voluntary\nparticipation in the sentiments of Zee; and the superior wisdom of\nmy host might probably suggest some sage extrication from my perilous\ndilemma. In this resolve I obeyed the ordinary instinct of civilised and\nmoral man, who, erring though he be, still generally prefers the right\ncourse in those cases where it is obviously against his inclinations,\nhis interests, and his safety to elect the wrong one.\n\n\n\nChapter XXII.\n\n\nAs the reader has seen, Aph-Lin had not favoured my general and\nunrestricted intercourse with his countrywomen. Though relying on my\npromise to abstain from giving any information as to the world I had\nleft, and still more on the promise of those to whom had been put the\nsame request, not to question me, which Zee had exacted from Taee, yet\nhe did not feel sure that, if I were allowed to mix with the strangers\nwhose curiosity the sight of me had aroused, I could sufficiently guard\nmyself against their inquiries. When I went out, therefore, it was never\nalone; I was always accompanied either by one of my host\u0092s family, or\nmy child-friend Taee. Bra, Aph-Lin\u0092s wife, seldom stirred beyond the\ngardens which surrounded the house, and was fond of reading the ancient\nliterature, which contained something of romance and adventure not to be\nfound in the writings of recent ages, and presented pictures of a\nlife unfamiliar to her experience and interesting to her imagination;\npictures, indeed, of a life more resembling that which we lead every day\nabove ground, coloured by our sorrows, sins, passions, and much to her\nwhat the tales of the Genii or the Arabian Nights are to us. But her\nlove of reading did not prevent Bra from the discharge of her duties as\nmistress of the largest household in the city. She went daily the\nround of the chambers, and saw that the automata and other mechanical\ncontrivances were in order, that the numerous children employed by\nAph-Lin, whether in his private or public capacity, were carefully\ntended. Bra also inspected the accounts of the whole estate, and it was\nher great delight to assist her husband in the business connected with\nhis office as chief administrator of the Lighting Department, so that\nher avocations necessarily kept her much within doors. The two sons were\nboth completing their education at the College of Sages; and the\nelder, who had a strong passion for mechanics, and especially for works\nconnected with the machinery of timepieces and automata, had decided on\ndevoting himself to these pursuits, and was now occupied in constructing\na shop or warehouse, at which his inventions could be exhibited and\nsold. The younger son preferred farming and rural occupations; and when\nnot attending the College, at which he chiefly studied the theories\nof agriculture, was much absorbed by his practical application of that\nscience to his father\u0092s lands. It will be seen by this how completely\nequality of ranks is established among this people--a shopkeeper being\nof exactly the same grade in estimation as the large landed proprietor.\nAph-Lin was the wealthiest member of the community, and his eldest son\npreferred keeping a shop to any other avocation; nor was this choice\nthought to show any want of elevated notions on his part.\n\nThis young man had been much interested in examining my watch, the works\nof which were new to him, and was greatly pleased when I made him a\npresent of it. Shortly after, he returned the gift with interest, by a\nwatch of his own construction, marking both the time as in my watch and\nthe time as kept among the Vril-ya. I have that watch still, and it has\nbeen much admired by many among the most eminent watchmakers of London\nand Paris. It is of gold, with diamond hands and figures, and it plays a\nfavorite tune among the Vril-ya in striking the hours: it only requires\nto be wound up once in ten months, and has never gone wrong since I had\nit. These young brothers being thus occupied, my usual companions in\nthat family, when I went abroad, were my host or his daughter. Now,\nagreeably with the honourable conclusions I had come to, I began to\nexcuse myself from Zee\u0092s invitations to go out alone with her, and\nseized an occasion when that learned Gy was delivering a lecture at the\nCollege of Sages to ask Aph-Lin to show me his country-seat. As this was\nat some little distance, and as Aph-Lin was not fond of walking, while I\nhad discreetly relinquished all attempts at flying, we proceeded to our\ndestination in one of the aerial boats belonging to my host. A child of\neight years old, in his employ, was our conductor. My host and myself\nreclined on cushions, and I found the movement very easy and luxurious.\n\u0093Aph-Lin,\u0094 said I, \u0093you will not, I trust, be displeased with me, if I\nask your permission to travel for a short time, and visit other tribes\nor communities of your illustrious race. I have also a strong desire to\nsee those nations which do not adopt your institutions, and which you\nconsider as savages. It would interest me greatly to notice what are the\ndistinctions between them and the races whom we consider civilised in\nthe world I have left.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is utterly impossible that you should go hence alone,\u0094 said Aph-Lin.\n\u0093Even among the Vril-ya you would be exposed to great dangers. Certain\npeculiarities of formation and colour, and the extraordinary phenomenon\nof hirsute bushes upon your cheeks and chin, denoting in you a species\nof An distinct alike from our own race and any known race of barbarians\nyet extant, would attract, of course, the special attention of the\nCollege of Sages in whatever community of Vril-ya you visited, and it\nwould depend upon the individual temper of some individual sage whether\nyou would be received, as you have been here, hospitably, or whether you\nwould not be at once dissected for scientific purposes. Know that when\nthe Tur first took you to his house, and while you were there put to\nsleep by Taee in order to recover from your previous pain or fatigue,\nthe sages summoned by the Tur were divided in opinion whether you were\na harmless or an obnoxious animal. During your unconscious state your\nteeth were examined, and they clearly showed that you were not only\ngraminivorous but carnivorous. Carnivorous animals of your size are\nalways destroyed, as being of savage and dangerous nature. Our teeth, as\nyou have doubtless observed,* are not those of the creatures who devour\nflesh.\u0094\n\n* I never had observed it; and, if I had, am not physiologist enough to\nhave distinguished the difference.\n\n\u0093It is, indeed, maintained by Zee and other philosophers, that as, in\nremote ages, the Ana did prey upon living beings of the brute species,\ntheir teeth must have been fitted for that purpose. But, even if so,\nthey have been modified by hereditary transmission, and suited to the\nfood on which we now exist; nor are even the barbarians, who adopt the\nturbulent and ferocious institutions of Glek-Nas, devourers of flesh\nlike beasts of prey.\n\n\u0093In the course of this dispute it was proposed to dissect you; but\nTaee begged you off, and the Tur being, by office, averse to all novel\nexperiments at variance with our custom of sparing life, except where it\nis clearly proved to be for the good of the community to take it, sent\nto me, whose business it is, as the richest man of the state, to afford\nhospitality to strangers from a distance. It was at my option to decide\nwhether or not you were a stranger whom I could safely admit. Had I\ndeclined to receive you, you would have been handed over to the College\nof Sages, and what might there have befallen you I do not like to\nconjecture. Apart from this danger, you might chance to encounter some\nchild of four years old, just put in possession of his vril staff; and\nwho, in alarm at your strange appearance, and in the impulse of the\nmoment, might reduce you to a cinder. Taee himself was about to do so\nwhen he first saw you, had his father not checked his hand. Therefore I\nsay you cannot travel alone, but with Zee you would be safe; and I have\nno doubt that she would accompany you on a tour round the neighbouring\ncommunities of Vril-ya (to the savage states, No!): I will ask her.\u0094\n\nNow, as my main object in proposing to travel was to escape from Zee, I\nhastily exclaimed, \u0093Nay, pray do not! I relinquish my design. You have\nsaid enough as to its dangers to deter me from it; and I can scarcely\nthink it right that a young Gy of the personal attractions of your\nlovely daughter should travel into other regions without a better\nprotector than a Tish of my insignificant strength and stature.\u0094\n\nAph-Lin emitted the soft sibilant sound which is the nearest approach\nto laughter that a full-grown An permits to himself, ere he replied:\n\u0093Pardon my discourteous but momentary indulgence of mirth at any\nobservation seriously made by my guest. I could not but be amused at the\nidea of Zee, who is so fond of protecting others that children call her\n\u0091THE GUARDIAN,\u0092 needing a protector herself against any dangers arising\nfrom the audacious admiration of males. Know that our Gy-ei, while\nunmarried, are accustomed to travel alone among other tribes, to see if\nthey find there some An who may please them more than the Ana they find\nat home. Zee has already made three such journeys, but hitherto her\nheart has been untouched.\u0094\n\nHere the opportunity which I sought was afforded to me, and I said,\nlooking down, and with faltering voice, \u0093Will you, my kind host, promise\nto pardon me, if what I am about to say gives offence?\u0094\n\n\u0093Say only the truth, and I cannot be offended; or, could I be so, it\nwould not be for me, but for you to pardon.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then, assist me to quit you, and, much as I should have like\nto witness more of the wonders, and enjoy more of the felicity, which\nbelong to your people, let me return to my own.\u0094\n\n\u0093I fear there are reasons why I cannot do that; at all events, not\nwithout permission of the Tur, and he, probably, would not grant it. You\nare not destitute of intelligence; you may (though I do not think\nso) have concealed the degree of destructive powers possessed by your\npeople; you might, in short, bring upon us some danger; and if the Tur\nentertains that idea, it would clearly be his duty, either to put an end\nto you, or enclose you in a cage for the rest of your existence. But why\nshould you wish to leave a state of society which you so politely allow\nto be more felicitous than your own?\u0094\n\n\u0093Oh, Aph-Lin! My answer is plain. Lest in naught, and unwittingly, I\nshould betray your hospitality; lest, in the caprice of will which in\nour world is proverbial among the other sex, and from which even a Gy\nis not free, your adorable daughter should deign to regard me, though a\nTish, as if I were a civilised An, and--and--and---\u0094 \u0093Court you as\nher spouse,\u0094 put in Aph-Lin, gravely, and without any visible sign of\nsurprise or displeasure.\n\n\u0093You have said it.\u0094\n\n\u0093That would be a misfortune,\u0094 resumed my host, after a pause, \u0093and I\nfeel you have acted as you ought in warning me. It is, as you imply,\nnot uncommon for an unwedded Gy to conceive tastes as to the object she\ncovets which appear whimsical to others; but there is no power to compel\na young Gy to any course opposed to that which she chooses to pursue.\nAll we can to is to reason with her, and experience tells us that the\nwhole College of Sages would find it vain to reason with a Gy in a\nmatter that concerns her choice in love. I grieve for you, because such\na marriage would be against the A-glauran, or good of the community, for\nthe children of such a marriage would adulterate the race: they might\neven come into the world with the teeth of carnivorous animals; this\ncould not be allowed: Zee, as a Gy, cannot be controlled; but you, as a\nTish, can be destroyed. I advise you, then, to resist her addresses;\nto tell her plainly that you can never return her love. This happens\nconstantly. Many an An, however, ardently wooed by one Gy, rejects her,\nand puts an end to her persecution by wedding another. The same course\nis open to you.\u0094\n\n\u0093No; for I cannot wed another Gy without equally injuring the community,\nand exposing it to the chance of rearing carnivorous children.\u0094\n\n\u0093That is true. All I can say, and I say it with the tenderness due to a\nTish, and the respect due to a guest, is frankly this--if you yield, you\nwill become a cinder. I must leave it to you to take the best way you\ncan to defend yourself. Perhaps you had better tell Zee that she is\nugly. That assurance on the lips of him she woos generally suffices to\nchill the most ardent Gy. Here we are at my country-house.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter XXIII.\n\n\nI confess that my conversation with Aph-Lin, and the extreme coolness\nwith which he stated his inability to control the dangerous caprice of\nhis daughter, and treated the idea of the reduction into a cinder to\nwhich her amorous flame might expose my too seductive person, took away\nthe pleasure I should otherwise have had in the contemplation of my\nhost\u0092s country-seat, and the astonishing perfection of the machinery\nby which his farming operations were conducted. The house differed in\nappearance from the massive and sombre building which Aph-Lin inhabited\nin the city, and which seemed akin to the rocks out of which the city\nitself had been hewn into shape. The walls of the country-seat\nwere composed by trees placed a few feet apart from each other, the\ninterstices being filled in with the transparent metallic substance\nwhich serves the purpose of glass among the Ana. These trees were all in\nflower, and the effect was very pleasing, if not in the best taste. We\nwere received at the porch by life-like automata, who conducted us\ninto a chamber, the like to which I never saw before, but have often on\nsummer days dreamily imagined. It was a bower--half room, half garden.\nThe walls were one mass of climbing flowers. The open spaces, which\nwe call windows, and in which, here, the metallic surfaces were slided\nback, commanded various views; some, of the wide landscape with its\nlakes and rocks; some, of small limited expanses answering to our\nconservatories, filled with tiers of flowers. Along the sides of the\nroom were flower-beds, interspersed with cushions for repose. In the\ncentre of the floor was a cistern and a fountain of that liquid light\nwhich I have presumed to be naphtha. It was luminous and of a roseate\nhue; it sufficed without lamps to light up the room with a subdued\nradiance. All around the fountain was carpeted with a soft deep lichen,\nnot green (I have never seen that colour in the vegetation of this\ncountry), but a quiet brown, on which the eye reposes with the same\nsense of relief as that with which in the upper world it reposes\non green. In the outlets upon flowers (which I have compared to our\nconservatories) there were singing birds innumerable, which, while we\nremained in the room, sang in those harmonies of tune to which they are,\nin these parts, so wonderfully trained. The roof was open. The whole\nscene had charms for every sense--music form the birds, fragrance from\nthe flowers, and varied beauty to the eye at every aspect. About all was\na voluptuous repose. What a place, methought, for a honeymoon, if a Gy\nbride were a little less formidably armed not only with the rights\nof woman, but with the powers of man! But when one thinks of a Gy, so\nlearned, so tall, so stately, so much above the standard of the creature\nwe call woman as was Zee, no! even if I had felt no fear of being\nreduced to a cinder, it is not of her I should have dreamed in that\nbower so constructed for dreams of poetic love.\n\nThe automata reappeared, serving one of those delicious liquids which\nform the innocent wines of the Vril-ya.\n\n\u0093Truly,\u0094 said I, \u0093this is a charming residence, and I can scarcely\nconceive why you do not settle yourself here instead of amid the\ngloomier abodes of the city.\u0094\n\n\u0093As responsible to the community for the administration of light, I am\ncompelled to reside chiefly in the city, and can only come hither for\nshort intervals.\u0094\n\n\u0093But since I understand from you that no honours are attached to your\noffice, and it involves some trouble, why do you accept it?\u0094\n\n\u0093Each of us obeys without question the command of the Tur. He said, \u0091Be\nit requested that Aph-Lin shall be the Commissioner of Light,\u0092 so I had\nno choice; but having held the office now for a long time, the cares,\nwhich were at first unwelcome, have become, if not pleasing, at least\nendurable. We are all formed by custom--even the difference of our race\nfrom the savage is but the transmitted continuance of custom, which\nbecomes, through hereditary descent, part and parcel of our nature. You\nsee there are Ana who even reconcile themselves to the responsibilities\nof chief magistrate, but no one would do so if his duties had not been\nrendered so light, or if there were any questions as to compliance with\nhis requests.\u0094\n\n\u0093Not even if you thought the requests unwise or unjust?\u0094\n\n\u0093We do not allow ourselves to think so, and, indeed, everything goes on\nas if each and all governed themselves according to immemorial custom.\u0094\n\n\u0093When the chief magistrate dies or retires, how do you provide for his\nsuccessor?\u0094\n\n\u0093The An who has discharged the duties of chief magistrate for many years\nis the best person to choose one by whom those duties may be understood,\nand he generally names his successor.\u0094\n\n\u0093His son, perhaps?\u0094\n\n\u0093Seldom that; for it is not an office any one desires or seeks, and a\nfather naturally hesitates to constrain his son. But if the Tur himself\ndecline to make a choice, for fear it might be supposed that he owed\nsome grudge to the person on whom his choice would settle, then there\nare three of the College of Sages who draw lots among themselves which\nshall have the power to elect the chief. We consider that the judgment\nof one An of ordinary capacity is better than the judgment of three or\nmore, however wise they may be; for among three there would probably\nbe disputes, and where there are disputes, passion clouds judgment. The\nworst choice made by one who has no motive in choosing wrong, is better\nthan the best choice made by many who have many motives for not choosing\nright.\u0094\n\n\u0093You reverse in your policy the maxims adopted in my country.\u0094\n\n\u0093Are you all, in your country, satisfied with your governors?\u0094\n\n\u0093All! Certainly not; the governors that most please some are sure to be\nthose most displeasing to others.\u0094\n\n\u0093Then our system is better than yours.\u0094 \u0093For you it may be; but\naccording to our system a Tish could not be reduced to a cinder if a\nfemale compelled him to marry her; and as a Tish I sigh to return to my\nnative world.\u0094\n\n\u0093Take courage, my dear little guest; Zee can\u0092t compel you to marry her.\nShe can only entice you to do so. Don\u0092t be enticed. Come and look round\nmy domain.\u0094\n\nWe went forth into a close, bordered with sheds; for though the Ana keep\nno stock for food, there are some animals which they rear for milking\nand others for shearing. The former have no resemblance to our cows,\nnor the latter to our sheep, nor do I believe such species exist amongst\nthem. They use the milk of three varieties of animal: one resembles the\nantelope, but is much larger, being as tall as a camel; the other two\nare smaller, and, though differing somewhat from each other, resemble\nno creature I ever saw on earth. They are very sleek and of rounded\nproportions; their colour that of the dappled deer, with very mild\ncountenances and beautiful dark eyes. The milk of these three creatures\ndiffers in richness and taste. It is usually diluted with water, and\nflavoured with the juice of a peculiar and perfumed fruit, and in itself\nis very nutritious and palatable. The animal whose fleece serves them\nfor clothing and many other purposes, is more like the Italian she-goat\nthan any other creature, but is considerably larger, has no horns,\nand is free from the displeasing odour of our goats. Its fleece is not\nthick, but very long and fine; it varies in colour, but is never white,\nmore generally of a slate-like or lavender hue. For clothing it is\nusually worn dyed to suit the taste of the wearer. These animals were\nexceedingly tame, and were treated with extraordinary care and affection\nby the children (chiefly female) who tended them.\n\nWe then went through vast storehouses filled with grains and fruits.\nI may here observe that the main staple of food among these people\nconsists--firstly, of a kind of corn much larger in ear than our wheat,\nand which by culture is perpetually being brought into new varieties of\nflavour; and, secondly, of a fruit of about the size of a small orange,\nwhich, when gathered, is hard and bitter. It is stowed away for many\nmonths in their warehouses, and then becomes succulent and tender. Its\njuice, which is of dark-red colour, enters into most of their sauces.\nThey have many kinds of fruit of the nature of the olive, from which\ndelicious oils are extracted. They have a plant somewhat resembling the\nsugar-cane, but its juices are less sweet and of a delicate perfume.\nThey have no bees nor honey-making insects, but they make much use of a\nsweet gum that oozes from a coniferous plant, not unlike the araucaria.\nTheir soil teems also with esculent roots and vegetables, which it is\nthe aim of their culture to improve and vary to the utmost. And I never\nremember any meal among this people, however it might be confined to\nthe family household, in which some delicate novelty in such articles of\nfood was not introduced. In fine, as I before observed, their cookery is\nexquisite, so diversified and nutritious that one does not miss animal\nfood; and their own physical forms suffice to show that with them, at\nleast, meat is not required for superior production of muscular fibre.\nThey have no grapes--the drinks extracted from their fruits are innocent\nand refreshing. Their staple beverage, however, is water, in the choice\nof which they are very fastidious, distinguishing at once the slightest\nimpurity.\n\n\u0093My younger son takes great pleasure in augmenting our produce,\u0094 said\nAph-Lin as we passed through the storehouses, \u0093and therefore will\ninherit these lands, which constitute the chief part of my wealth. To my\nelder son such inheritance would be a great trouble and affliction.\u0094\n\n\u0093Are there many sons among you who think the inheritance of vast wealth\nwould be a great trouble and affliction?\u0094\n\n\u0093Certainly; there are indeed very few of the Vril-ya who do not consider\nthat a fortune much above the average is a heavy burden. We are rather a\nlazy people after the age of childhood, and do not like undergoing more\ncares than we can help, and great wealth does give its owner many cares.\nFor instance, it marks us out for public offices, which none of us\nlike and none of us can refuse. It necessitates our taking a continued\ninterest in the affairs of any of our poorer countrymen, so that we may\nanticipate their wants and see that none fall into poverty. There is\nan old proverb amongst us which says, \u0091The poor man\u0092s need is the rich\nman\u0092s shame---\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093Pardon me, if I interrupt you for a moment. You allow that some, even\nof the Vril-ya, know want, and need relief.\u0094\n\n\u0093If by want you mean the destitution that prevails in a Koom-Posh, THAT\nis impossible with us, unless an An has, by some extraordinary process,\ngot rid of all his means, cannot or will not emigrate, and has either\ntired out the affectionate aid of this relations or personal friends, or\nrefuses to accept it.\u0094\n\n\u0093Well, then, does he not supply the place of an infant or automaton, and\nbecome a labourer--a servant?\u0094\n\n\u0093No; then we regard him as an unfortunate person of unsound reason,\nand place him, at the expense of the State, in a public building, where\nevery comfort and every luxury that can mitigate his affliction are\nlavished upon him. But an An does not like to be considered out of his\nmind, and therefore such cases occur so seldom that the public building\nI speak of is now a deserted ruin, and the last inmate of it was an An\nwhom I recollect to have seen in my childhood. He did not seem conscious\nof loss of reason, and wrote glaubs (poetry). When I spoke of wants, I\nmeant such wants as an An with desires larger than his means sometimes\nentertains--for expensive singing-birds, or bigger houses, or\ncountry-gardens; and the obvious way to satisfy such wants is to buy of\nhim something that he sells. Hence Ana like myself, who are very rich,\nare obliged to buy a great many things they do not require, and live on\na very large scale where they might prefer to live on a small one. For\ninstance, the great size of my house in the town is a source of much\ntrouble to my wife, and even to myself; but I am compelled to have it\nthus incommodiously large, because, as the richest An of the community,\nI am appointed to entertain the strangers from the other communities\nwhen they visit us, which they do in great crowds twice-a-year, when\ncertain periodical entertainments are held, and when relations scattered\nthroughout all the realms of the Vril-ya joyfully reunite for a time.\nThis hospitality, on a scale so extensive, is not to my taste, and\ntherefore I should have been happier had I been less rich. But we must\nall bear the lot assigned to us in this short passage through time that\nwe call life. After all, what are a hundred years, more or less, to the\nages through which we must pass hereafter? Luckily, I have one son who\nlikes great wealth. It is a rare exception to the general rule, and I\nown I cannot myself understand it.\u0094\n\nAfter this conversation I sought to return to the subject which\ncontinued to weigh on my heart--viz., the chances of escape from Zee.\nBut my host politely declined to renew that topic, and summoned our\nair-boat. On our way back we were met by Zee, who, having found us gone,\non her return from the College of Sages, had unfurled her wings and\nflown in search of us.\n\nHer grand, but to me unalluring, countenance brightened as she beheld\nme, and, poising herself beside the boat on her large outspread plumes,\nshe said reproachfully to Aph-Lin--\u0093Oh, father, was it right in you\nto hazard the life of your guest in a vehicle to which he is so\nunaccustomed? He might, by an incautious movement, fall over the side;\nand alas; he is not like us, he has no wings. It were death to him to\nfall. Dear one!\u0094 (she added, accosting my shrinking self in a softer\nvoice), \u0093have you no thought of me, that you should thus hazard a life\nwhich has become almost a part of mine? Never again be thus rash, unless\nI am thy companion. What terror thou hast stricken into me!\u0094\n\nI glanced furtively at Aph-Lin, expecting, at least, that he would\nindignantly reprove his daughter for expressions of anxiety and\naffection, which, under all the circumstances, would, in the world above\nground, be considered immodest in the lips of a young female, addressed\nto a male not affianced to her, even if of the same rank as herself.\n\nBut so confirmed are the rights of females in that region, and so\nabsolutely foremost among those rights do females claim the privilege\nof courtship, that Aph-Lin would no more have thought of reproving his\nvirgin daughter than he would have thought of disobeying the orders of\nthe Tur. In that country, custom, as he implied, is all in all.\n\nHe answered mildly, \u0093Zee, the Tish is in no danger and it is my belief\nthe he can take very good care of himself.\u0094\n\n\u0093I would rather that he let me charge myself with his care. Oh, heart of\nmy heart, it was in the thought of thy danger that I first felt how much\nI loved thee!\u0094\n\nNever did man feel in such a false position as I did. These words were\nspoken loud in the hearing of Zee\u0092s father--in the hearing of the child\nwho steered. I blushed with shame for them, and for her, and could not\nhelp replying angrily: \u0093Zee, either you mock me, which, as your father\u0092s\nguest, misbecomes you, or the words you utter are improper for a maiden\nGy to address even to an An of her own race, if he has not wooed her\nwith the consent of her parents. How much more improper to address them\nto a Tish, who has never presumed to solicit your affections, and who\ncan never regard you with other sentiments than those of reverence and\nawe!\u0094\n\nAph-Lin made me a covert sing of approbation, but said nothing. \u0093Be not\nso cruel!\u0094 exclaimed Zee, still in sonorous accents. \u0093Can love command\nitself where it is truly felt? Do you suppose that a maiden Gy will\nconceal a sentiment that it elevates her to feel? What a country you\nmust have come from!\u0094\n\nHere Aph-Lin gently interposed, saying, \u0093Among the Tish-a the rights of\nyour sex do not appear to be established, and at all events my guest may\nconverse with you more freely if unchecked by the presence of others.\u0094\n\nTo this remark Zee made no reply, but, darting on me a tender\nreproachful glance, agitated her wings and fled homeward.\n\n\u0093I had counted, at least, on some aid from my host,\u0094 I said bitterly,\n\u0093in the perils to which his own daughter exposes me.\u0094\n\n\u0093I gave you the best aid I could. To contradict a Gy in her love affairs\nis to confirm her purpose. She allows no counsel to come between her and\nher affections.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter XXIV.\n\n\nOn alighting from the air-boat, a child accosted Aph-Lin in the hall\nwith a request that he would be present at the funeral obsequies of a\nrelation who had recently departed from that nether world.\n\nNow, I had never seen a burial-place or cemetery amongst this people,\nand, glad to seize even so melancholy an occasion to defer an encounter\nwith Zee, I asked Aph-Lin if I might be permitted to witness with him\nthe interment of his relation; unless, indeed, it were regarded as one\nof those sacred ceremonies to which a stranger to their race might not\nbe admitted.\n\n\u0093The departure of an An to a happier world,\u0094 answered my host, \u0093when, as\nin the case of my kinsman, he has lived so long in this as to have lost\npleasure in it, is rather a cheerful though quiet festival than a sacred\nceremony, and you may accompany me if you will.\u0094\n\nPreceded by the child-messenger, we walked up the main street to a house\nat some little distance, and, entering the hall, were conducted to a\nroom on the ground floor, where we found several persons assembled round\na couch on which was laid the deceased. It was an old man, who had, as I\nwas told, lived beyond his 130th year. To judge by the calm smile on his\ncountenance, he had passed away without suffering. One of the sons, who\nwas now the head of the family, and who seemed in vigorous middle life,\nthough he was considerably more than seventy, stepped forward with a\ncheerful face and told Aph-Lin \u0093that the day before he died his father\nhad seen in a dream his departed Gy, and was eager to be reunited to\nher, and restored to youth beneath the nearer smile of the All-Good.\u0094\n\nWhile these two were talking, my attention was drawn to a dark metallic\nsubstance at the farther end of the room. It was about twenty feet in\nlength, narrow in proportion, and all closed round, save, near the roof,\nthere were small round holes through which might be seen a red light.\nFrom the interior emanated a rich and sweet perfume; and while I was\nconjecturing what purpose this machine was to serve, all the time-pieces\nin the town struck the hour with their solemn musical chime; and as\nthat sound ceased, music of a more joyous character, but still of a joy\nsubdued and tranquil, rang throughout the chamber, and from the walls\nbeyond, in a choral peal. Symphonious with the melody, those in the room\nlifted their voices in chant. The words of this hymn were simple. They\nexpressed no regret, no farewell, but rather a greeting to the new world\nwhither the deceased had preceded the living. Indeed, in their language,\nthe funeral hymn is called the \u0091Birth Song.\u0092 Then the corpse, covered\nby a long cerement, was tenderly lifted up by six of the nearest kinfolk\nand borne towards the dark thing I have described. I pressed forward to\nsee what happened. A sliding door or panel at one end was lifted up--the\nbody deposited within, on a shelf--the door reclosed--a spring a the\nside touched--a sudden \u0091whishing,\u0092 sighing sound heard from within;\nand lo! at the other end of the machine the lid fell down, and a small\nhandful of smouldering dust dropped into a \u0091patera\u0092 placed to receive\nit. The son took up the \u0091patera\u0092 and said (in what I understood\nafterwards was the usual form of words), \u0093Behold how great is the Maker!\nTo this little dust He gave form and life and soul. It needs not this\nlittle dust for Him to renew form and life and soul to the beloved one\nwe shall soon see again.\u0094\n\nEach present bowed his head and pressed his hand to his heart. Then a\nyoung female child opened a small door within the wall, and I perceived,\nin the recess, shelves on which were placed many \u0091paterae\u0092 like that\nwhich the son held, save that they all had covers. With such a cover\na Gy now approached the son, and placed it over the cup, on which it\nclosed with a spring. On the lid were engraven the name of the deceased,\nand these words:--\u0093Lent to us\u0094 (here the date of birth). \u0093Recalled from\nus\u0094 (here the date of death).\n\nThe closed door shut with a musical sound, and all was over.\n\n\n\nChapter XXV.\n\n\n\u0093And this,\u0094 said I, with my mind full of what I had witnessed--\u0093this, I\npresume, is your usual form of burial?\u0094\n\n\u0093Our invariable form,\u0094 answered Aph-Lin. \u0093What is it amongst your\npeople?\u0094\n\n\u0093We inter the body whole within the earth.\u0094\n\n\u0093What! To degrade the form you have loved and honoured, the wife on\nwhose breast you have slept, to the loathsomeness of corruption?\u0094 \u0093But\nif the soul lives again, can it matter whether the body waste within\nthe earth or is reduced by that awful mechanism, worked, no doubt by the\nagency of vril, into a pinch of dust?\u0094\n\n\u0093You answer well,\u0094 said my host, \u0093and there is no arguing on a matter\nof feeling; but to me your custom is horrible and repulsive, and would\nserve to invest death with gloomy and hideous associations. It is\nsomething, too, to my mind, to be able to preserve the token of what has\nbeen our kinsman or friend within the abode in which we live. We thus\nfeel more sensibly that he still lives, though not visibly so to us. But\nour sentiments in this, as in all things, are created by custom. Custom\nis not to be changed by a wise An, any more than it is changed by a\nwise Community, without the greatest deliberation, followed by the\nmost earnest conviction. It is only thus that change ceases to be\nchangeability, and once made is made for good.\u0094\n\nWhen we regained the house, Aph-Lin summoned some of the children in his\nservice and sent them round to several of his friends, requesting their\nattendance that day, during the Easy Hours, to a festival in honour of\nhis kinsman\u0092s recall to the All-Good. This was the largest and gayest\nassembly I ever witnessed during my stay among the Ana, and was\nprolonged far into the Silent Hours.\n\nThe banquet was spread in a vast chamber reserved especially for grand\noccasions. This differed from our entertainments, and was not without\na certain resemblance to those we read of in the luxurious age of the\nRoman empire. There was not one great table set out, but numerous small\ntables, each appropriated to eight guests. It is considered that beyond\nthat number conversation languishes and friendship cools. The Ana never\nlaugh loud, as I have before observed, but the cheerful ring of their\nvoices at the various tables betokened gaiety of intercourse. As they\nhave no stimulant drinks, and are temperate in food, though so choice\nand dainty, the banquet itself did not last long. The tables sank\nthrough the floor, and then came musical entertainments for those who\nliked them. Many, however, wandered away:--some of the younger ascended\nin their wings, for the hall was roofless, forming aerial dances; others\nstrolled through the various apartments, examining the curiosities with\nwhich they were stored, or formed themselves into groups for various\ngames, the favourite of which is a complicated kind of chess played by\neight persons. I mixed with the crowd, but was prevented joining in the\nconversation by the constant companionship of one or the other of my\nhost\u0092s sons, appointed to keep me from obtrusive questionings. The\nguests, however, noticed me but slightly; they had grown accustomed to\nmy appearance, seeing me so often in the streets, and I had ceased to\nexcite much curiosity.\n\nTo my great delight Zee avoided me, and evidently sought to excite my\njealousy by marked attentions to a very handsome young An, who (though,\nas is the modest custom of the males when addressed by females, he\nanswered with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks, and was demure and shy\nas young ladies new to the world are in most civilised countries, except\nEngland and America) was evidently much charmed by the tall Gy, and\nready to falter a bashful \u0093Yes\u0094 if she had actually proposed. Fervently\nhoping that she would, and more and more averse to the idea of reduction\nto a cinder after I had seen the rapidity with which a human body can be\nhurried into a pinch of dust, I amused myself by watching the manners of\nthe other young people. I had the satisfaction of observing that Zee was\nno singular assertor of a female\u0092s most valued rights. Wherever I turned\nmy eyes, or lent my ears, it seemed to me that the Gy was the wooing\nparty, and the An the coy and reluctant one. The pretty innocent airs\nwhich an An gave himself on being thus courted, the dexterity with which\nhe evaded direct answers to professions of attachment, or turned into\njest the flattering compliments addressed to him, would have done honour\nto the most accomplished coquette. Both my male chaperons were subjected\ngreatly to these seductive influences, and both acquitted themselves\nwith wonderful honour to their tact and self-control.\n\nI said to the elder son, who preferred mechanical employments to\nthe management of a great property, and who was of an eminently\nphilosophical temperament,--\u0093I find it difficult to conceive how at your\nage, and with all the intoxicating effects on the senses, of music and\nlights and perfumes, you can be so cold to that impassioned young Gy who\nhas just left you with tears in her eyes at your cruelty.\u0094\n\nThe young An replied with a sigh, \u0093Gentle Tish, the greatest misfortune\nin life is to marry one Gy if you are in love with another.\u0094\n\n\u0093Oh! You are in love with another?\u0094\n\n\u0093Alas! Yes.\u0094\n\n\u0093And she does not return your love?\u0094\n\n\u0093I don\u0092t know. Sometimes a look, a tone, makes me hope so; but she has\nnever plainly told me that she loves me.\u0094\n\n\u0093Have you not whispered in her own ear that you love her?\u0094\n\n\u0093Fie! What are you thinking of? What world do you come from? Could I so\nbetray the dignity of my sex? Could I be so un-Anly--so lost to shame,\nas to own love to a Gy who has not first owned hers to me?\u0094\n\n\u0093Pardon: I was not quite aware that you pushed the modesty of your sex\nso far. But does no An ever say to a Gy, \u0091I love you,\u0092 till she says it\nfirst to him?\u0094\n\n\u0093I can\u0092t say that no An has ever done so, but if he ever does, he is\ndisgraced in the eyes of the Ana, and secretly despised by the Gy-ei.\nNo Gy, well brought up, would listen to him; she would consider that\nhe audaciously infringed on the rights of her sex, while outraging the\nmodesty which dignifies his own. It is very provoking,\u0094 continued the\nAn, \u0093for she whom I love has certainly courted no one else, and I cannot\nbut think she likes me. Sometimes I suspect that she does not court me\nbecause she fears I would ask some unreasonable settlement as to the\nsurrender of her rights. But if so, she cannot really love me, for where\na Gy really loves she forgoes all rights.\u0094\n\n\u0093Is this young Gy present?\u0094\n\n\u0093Oh yes. She sits yonder talking to my mother.\u0094\n\nI looked in the direction to which my eyes were thus guided, and saw\na Gy dressed in robes of bright red, which among this people is a sign\nthat a Gy as yet prefers a single state. She wears gray, a neutral tint,\nto indicate that she is looking about for a spouse; dark purple if she\nwishes to intimate that she has made a choice; purple and orange when\nshe is betrothed or married; light blue when she is divorced or a widow,\nand would marry again. Light blue is of course seldom seen.\n\nAmong a people where all are of so high a type of beauty, it is\ndifficult to single out one as peculiarly handsome. My young friend\u0092s\nchoice seemed to me to possess the average of good looks; but there was\nan expression in her face that pleased me more than did the faces of the\nyoung Gy-ei generally, because it looked less bold--less conscious of\nfemale rights. I observed that, while she talked to Bra, she glanced,\nfrom time to time, sidelong at my young friend.\n\n\u0093Courage,\u0094 said I, \u0093that young Gy loves you.\u0094\n\n\u0093Ay, but if she shall not say so, how am I the better for her love?\u0094\n\n\u0093Your mother is aware of your attachment?\u0094\n\n\u0093Perhaps so. I never owned it to her. It would be un-Anly to confide\nsuch weakness to a mother. I have told my father; he may have told it\nagain to his wife.\u0094\n\n\u0093Will you permit me to quit you for a moment and glide behind your\nmother and your beloved? I am sure they are talking about you. Do not\nhesitate. I promise that I will not allow myself to be questioned till I\nrejoin you.\u0094\n\nThe young An pressed his hand on his heart, touched me lightly on the\nhead, and allowed me to quit his side. I stole unobserved behind his\nmother and his beloved. I overheard their talk. Bra was speaking;\nsaid she, \u0093There can be no doubt of this: either my son, who is of\nmarriageable age, will be decoyed into marriage with one of his many\nsuitors, or he will join those who emigrate to a distance and we shall\nsee him no more. If you really care for him, my dear Lo, you should\npropose.\u0094\n\n\u0093I do care for him, Bra; but I doubt if I could really ever win his\naffections. He is fond of his inventions and timepieces; and I am not\nlike Zee, but so dull that I fear I could not enter into his favourite\npursuits, and then he would get tired of me, and at the end of three\nyears divorce me, and I could never marry another--never.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is not necessary to know about timepieces to know how to be so\nnecessary to the happiness of an An, who cares for timepieces, that he\nwould rather give up the timepieces than divorce his Gy. You see, my\ndear Lo,\u0094 continued Bra, \u0093that precisely because we are the stronger\nsex, we rule the other provided we never show our strength. If you were\nsuperior to my son in making timepieces and automata, you should, as\nhis wife, always let him suppose you thought him superior in that art to\nyourself. The An tacitly allows the pre-eminence of the Gy in all\nexcept his own special pursuit. But if she either excels him in that,\nor affects not to admire him for his proficiency in it, he will not love\nher very long; perhaps he may even divorce her. But where a Gy really\nloves, she soon learns to love all that the An does.\u0094\n\nThe young Gy made no answer to this address. She looked down musingly,\nthen a smile crept over her lips, and she rose, still silent, and went\nthrough the crowd till she paused by the young An who loved her. I\nfollowed her steps, but discreetly stood at a little distance while\nI watched them. Somewhat to my surprise, till I recollected the coy\ntactics among the Ana, the lover seemed to receive her advances with an\nair of indifference. He even moved away, but she pursued his steps,\nand, a little time after, both spread their wings and vanished amid the\nluminous space above.\n\nJust then I was accosted by the chief magistrate, who mingled with the\ncrowd distinguished by no signs of deference or homage. It so happened\nthat I had not seen this great dignitary since the day I had entered\nhis dominions, and recalling Aph-Lin\u0092s words as to his terrible doubt\nwhether or not I should be dissected, a shudder crept over me at the\nsight of his tranquil countenance.\n\n\u0093I hear much of you, stranger, from my son Taee,\u0094 said the Tur, laying\nhis hand politely on my bended head. \u0093He is very fond of your society,\nand I trust you are not displeased with the customs of our people.\u0094\n\nI muttered some unintelligible answer, which I intended to be an\nassurance of my gratitude for the kindness I had received from the Tur,\nand my admiration of his countrymen, but the dissecting-knife gleamed\nbefore my mind\u0092s eye and choked my utterance. A softer voice said, \u0093My\nbrother\u0092s friend must be dear to me.\u0094 And looking up I saw a young\nGy, who might be sixteen years old, standing beside the magistrate and\ngazing at me with a very benignant countenance. She had not come to her\nfull growth, and was scarcely taller than myself (viz., about feet 10\ninches), and, thanks to that comparatively diminutive stature, I thought\nher the loveliest Gy I had hitherto seen. I suppose something in my eyes\nrevealed that impression, for her countenance grew yet more benignant.\n\u0093Taee tells me,\u0094 she said, \u0093that you have not yet learned to accustom\nyourself to wings. That grieves me, for I should have liked to fly with\nyou.\u0094\n\n\u0093Alas!\u0094 I replied, \u0093I can never hope to enjoy that happiness. I am\nassured by Zee that the safe use of wings is a hereditary gift, and it\nwould take generations before one of my race could poise himself in the\nair like a bird.\u0094 \u0093Let not that thought vex you too much,\u0094 replied this\namiable Princess, \u0093for, after all, there must come a day when Zee and\nmyself must resign our wings forever. Perhaps when that day comes we\nmight be glad if the An we chose was also without wings.\u0094\n\nThe Tur had left us, and was lost amongst the crowd. I began to feel\nat ease with Taee\u0092s charming sister, and rather startled her by the\nboldness of my compliment in replying, \u0093that no An she could choose\nwould ever use his wings to fly away from her.\u0094 It is so against custom\nfor an An to say such civil things to a Gy till she has declared her\npassion for him, and been accepted as his betrothed, that the young\nmaiden stood quite dumbfounded for a few moments. Nevertheless she\ndid not seem displeased. At last recovering herself, she invited me to\naccompany her into one of the less crowded rooms and listen to the songs\nof the birds. I followed her steps as she glided before me, and she led\nme into a chamber almost deserted. A fountain of naphtha was playing in\nthe centre of the room; round it were ranged soft divans, and the walls\nof the room were open on one side to an aviary in which the birds\nwere chanting their artful chorus. The Gy seated herself on one of the\ndivans, and I placed myself at her side. \u0093Taee tells me,\u0094 she said,\n\u0093that Aph-Lin has made it the law* of his house that you are not to be\nquestioned as to the country you come from or the reason why you visit\nus. Is it so?\u0094\n\n* Literally \u0093has said, In this house be it requested.\u0094 Words synonymous\nwith law, as implying forcible obligation, are avoided by this singular\npeople. Even had it been decreed by the Tur that his College of Sages\nshould dissect me, the decree would have ran blandly thus,--\u0093Be it\nrequested that, for the good of the community, the carnivorous Tish be\nrequested to submit himself to dissection.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is.\u0094\n\n\u0093May I, at least, without sinning against that law, ask at least if the\nGy-ei in your country are of the same pale colour as yourself, and no\ntaller?\u0094\n\n\u0093I do not think, O beautiful Gy, that I infringe the law of Aph-Lin,\nwhich is more binding on myself than any one, if I answer questions so\ninnocent. The Gy-ei in my country are much fairer of hue than I am, and\ntheir average height is at least a head shorter than mine.\u0094\n\n\u0093They cannot then be so strong as the Ana amongst you? But I suppose\ntheir superior vril force makes up for such extraordinary disadvantage\nof size?\u0094\n\n\u0093They do not profess the vril force as you know it. But still they are\nvery powerful in my country, and an An has small chance of a happy life\nif he be not more or less governed by his Gy.\u0094\n\n\u0093You speak feelingly,\u0094 said Taee\u0092s sister, in a tone of voice half sad,\nhalf petulant. \u0093You are married, of course.\u0094\n\n\u0093No--certainly not.\u0094\n\n\u0093Nor betrothed?\u0094\n\n\u0093Nor betrothed.\u0094\n\n\u0093Is it possible that no Gy has proposed to you?\u0094\n\n\u0093In my country the Gy does not propose; the An speaks first.\u0094\n\n\u0093What a strange reversal of the laws of nature!\u0094 said the maiden, \u0093and\nwhat want of modesty in your sex! But have you never proposed, never\nloved one Gy more than another?\u0094\n\nI felt embarrassed by these ingenious questionings, and said, \u0093Pardon\nme, but I think we are beginning to infringe upon Aph-Lin\u0092s injunction.\nThis much only will I answer, and then, I implore you, ask no more. I\ndid once feel the preference you speak of; I did propose, and the\nGy would willingly have accepted me, but her parents refused their\nconsent.\u0094\n\n\u0093Parents! Do you mean seriously to tell me that parents can interfere\nwith the choice of their daughters?\u0094\n\n\u0093Indeed they can, and do very often.\u0094\n\n\u0093I should not like to live in that country,\u0094 said the Gy simply; \u0093but I\nhope you will never go back to it.\u0094\n\nI bowed my head in silence. The Gy gently raised my face with her right\nhand, and looked into it tenderly. \u0093Stay with us,\u0094 she said; \u0093stay with\nus, and be loved.\u0094 What I might have answered, what dangers of becoming\na cinder I might have encountered, I still trouble to think, when the\nlight of the naphtha fountain was obscured by the shadow of wings; and\nZee, flying though the open roof, alighted beside us. She said not a\nword, but, taking my arm with her mighty hand, she drew me away, as a\nmother draws a naughty child, and led me through the apartments to one\nof the corridors, on which, by the mechanism they generally prefer to\nstairs, we ascended to my own room. This gained, Zee breathed on my\nforehead, touched my breast with her staff, and I was instantly plunged\ninto a profound sleep.\n\nWhen I awoke some hours later, and heard the songs of the birds in the\nadjoining aviary, the remembrance of Taee\u0092s sister, her gentle looks and\ncaressing words, vividly returned to me; and so impossible is it for one\nborn and reared in our upper world\u0092s state of society to divest\nhimself of ideas dictated by vanity and ambition, that I found myself\ninstinctively building proud castles in the air.\n\n\u0093Tish though I be,\u0094 thus ran my meditations--\u0093Tish though I be, it is\nthen clear that Zee is not the only Gy whom my appearance can captivate.\nEvidently I am loved by A PRINCESS, the first maiden of this land, the\ndaughter of the absolute Monarch whose autocracy they so idly seek to\ndisguise by the republican title of chief magistrate. But for the sudden\nswoop of that horrible Zee, this Royal Lady would have formally proposed\nto me; and though it may be very well for Aph-Lin, who is only a\nsubordinate minister, a mere Commissioner of Light, to threaten me with\ndestruction if I accept his daughter\u0092s hand, yet a Sovereign, whose word\nis law, could compel the community to abrogate any custom that forbids\nintermarriage with one of a strange race, and which in itself is a\ncontradiction to their boasted equality of ranks.\n\n\u0093It is not to be supposed that his daughter, who spoke with such\nincredulous scorn of the interference of parents, would not have\nsufficient influence with her Royal Father to save me from the\ncombustion to which Aph-Lin would condemn my form. And if I were exalted\nby such an alliance, who knows but what the Monarch might elect me as\nhis successor? Why not? Few among this indolent race of philosophers\nlike the burden of such greatness. All might be pleased to see the\nsupreme power lodged in the hands of an accomplished stranger who has\nexperience of other and livelier forms of existence; and once chosen,\nwhat reforms I would institute! What additions to the really pleasant\nbut too monotonous life of this realm my familiarity with the civilised\nnations above ground would effect! I am fond of the sports of the field.\nNext to war, is not the chase a king\u0092s pastime? In what varieties of\nstrange game does this nether world abound? How interesting to strike\ndown creatures that were known above ground before the Deluge! But how?\nBy that terrible vril, in which, from want of hereditary transmission, I\ncould never be a proficient? No, but by a civilised handy breech-loader,\nwhich these ingenious mechanicians could not only make, but no doubt\nimprove; nay, surely I saw one in the Museum. Indeed, as absolute king,\nI should discountenance vril altogether, except in cases of war. Apropos\nof war, it is perfectly absurd to stint a people so intelligent, so\nrich, so well armed, to a petty limit of territory sufficing for\n10,000 or 12,000 families. Is not this restriction a mere philosophical\ncrotchet, at variance with the aspiring element in human nature, such as\nhas been partially, and with complete failure, tried in the upper world\nby the late Mr. Robert Owen? Of course one would not go to war with the\nneighbouring nations as well armed as one\u0092s own subjects; but then,\nwhat of those regions inhabited by races unacquainted with vril, and\napparently resembling, in their democratic institutions, my American\ncountrymen? One might invade them without offence to the vril nations,\nour allies, appropriate their territories, extending, perhaps, to the\nmost distant regions of the nether earth, and thus rule over an empire\nin which the sun never sets. (I forgot, in my enthusiasm, that over\nthose regions there was no sun to set). As for the fantastical notion\nagainst conceding fame or renown to an eminent individual, because,\nforsooth, bestowal of honours insures contest in the pursuit of them,\nstimulates angry passions, and mars the felicity of peace--it is opposed\nto the very elements, not only of the human, but of the brute creation,\nwhich are all, if tamable, participators in the sentiment of praise and\nemulation. What renown would be given to a king who thus extended his\nempire! I should be deemed a demigod.\u0094 Thinking of that, the other\nfanatical notion of regulating this life by reference to one which,\nno doubt, we Christians firmly believe in, but never take into\nconsideration, I resolved that enlightened philosophy compelled me to\nabolish a heathen religion so superstitiously at variance with modern\nthought and practical action. Musing over these various projects, I felt\nhow much I should have liked at that moment to brighten my wits by\na good glass of whiskey-and-water. Not that I am habitually a\nspirit-drinker, but certainly there are times when a little stimulant\nof alcoholic nature, taken with a cigar, enlivens the imagination. Yes;\ncertainly among these herbs and fruits there would be a liquid from\nwhich one could extract a pleasant vinous alcohol; and with a steak cut\noff one of those elks (ah! what offence to science to reject the animal\nfood which our first medical men agree in recommending to the gastric\njuices of mankind!) one would certainly pass a more exhilarating hour\nof repast. Then, too, instead of those antiquated dramas performed\nby childish amateurs, certainly, when I am king, I will introduce our\nmodern opera and a \u0091corps de ballet,\u0092 for which one might find, among\nthe nations I shall conquer, young females of less formidable height and\nthews than the Gy-ei--not armed with vril, and not insisting upon one\u0092s\nmarrying them.\n\nI was so completely rapt in these and similar reforms, political,\nsocial, and moral, calculated to bestow on the people of the nether\nworld the blessings of a civilisation known to the races of the upper,\nthat I did not perceive that Zee had entered the chamber till I heard a\ndeep sigh, and, raising my eyes, beheld her standing by my couch.\n\nI need not say that, according to the manners of this people, a Gy can,\nwithout indecorum, visit an An in his chamber, although an An would be\nconsidered forward and immodest to the last degree if he entered the\nchamber of a Gy without previously obtaining her permission to do\nso. Fortunately I was in the full habiliments I had worn when Zee had\ndeposited me on the couch. Nevertheless I felt much irritated, as well\nas shocked, by her visit, and asked in a rude tone what she wanted.\n\n\u0093Speak gently, beloved one, I entreat you,\u0094 said she, \u0093for I am very\nunhappy. I have not slept since we parted.\u0094\n\n\u0093A due sense of your shameful conduct to me as your father\u0092s guest might\nwell suffice to banish sleep from your eyelids. Where was the affection\nyou pretend to have for me, where was even that politeness on which the\nVril-ya pride themselves, when, taking advantage alike of that physical\nstrength in which your sex, in this extraordinary region, excels our\nown, and of those detestable and unhallowed powers which the agencies of\nvril invest in your eyes and finger-ends, you exposed me to humiliation\nbefore your assembled visitors, before Her Royal Highness--I mean, the\ndaughter of your own chief magistrate,--carrying me off to bed like a\nnaughty infant, and plunging me into sleep, without asking my consent?\u0094\n\n\u0093Ungrateful! Do you reproach me for the evidences of my love? Can you\nthink that, even if unstung by the jealousy which attends upon love\ntill it fades away in blissful trust when we know that the heart we\nhave wooed is won, I could be indifferent to the perils to which the\naudacious overtures of that silly little child might expose you?\u0094 \u0093Hold!\nSince you introduce the subject of perils, it perhaps does not misbecome\nme to say that my most imminent perils come from yourself, or at least\nwould come if I believed in your love and accepted your addresses. Your\nfather has told me plainly that in that case I should be consumed into\na cinder with as little compunction as if I were the reptile whom Taee\nblasted into ashes with the flash of his wand.\u0094\n\n\u0093Do not let that fear chill your heart to me,\u0094 exclaimed Zee, dropping\non her knees and absorbing my right hand in the space of her ample palm.\n\u0093It is true, indeed, that we two cannot wed as those of the same race\nwed; true that the love between us must be pure as that which, in our\nbelief, exists between lovers who reunite in the new life beyond that\nboundary at which the old life ends. But is it not happiness enough to\nbe together, wedded in mind and in heart? Listen: I have just left\nmy father. He consents to our union on those terms. I have sufficient\ninfluence with the College of Sages to insure their request to the Tur\nnot to interfere with the free choice of a Gy; provided that her wedding\nwith one of another race be but the wedding of souls. Oh, think you that\ntrue love needs ignoble union? It is not that I yearn only to be by your\nside in this life, to be part and parcel of your joys and sorrows here:\nI ask here for a tie which will bind us for ever and for ever in the\nworld of immortals. Do you reject me?\u0094\n\nAs she spoke, she knelt, and the whole character of her face was\nchanged; nothing of sternness left to its grandeur; a divine light, as\nthat of an immortal, shining out from its human beauty. But she rather\nawed me as an angel than moved me as a woman, and after an embarrassed\npause, I faltered forth evasive expressions of gratitude, and sought, as\ndelicately as I could, to point out how humiliating would be my position\namongst her race in the light of a husband who might never be permitted\nthe name of father.\n\n\u0093But,\u0094 said Zee, \u0093this community does not constitute the whole world.\nNo; nor do all the populations comprised in the league of the Vril-ya.\nFor thy sake I will renounce my country and my people. We will fly\ntogether to some region where thou shalt be safe. I am strong enough to\nbear thee on my wings across the deserts that intervene. I am skilled\nenough to cleave open, amidst the rocks, valleys in which to build\nour home. Solitude and a hut with thee would be to me society and the\nuniverse. Or wouldst thou return to thine own world, above the surface\nof this, exposed to the uncertain seasons, and lit but by the changeful\norbs which constitute by thy description the fickle character of those\nsavage regions? I so, speak the word, and I will force the way for thy\nreturn, so that I am thy companion there, though, there as here, but\npartner of thy soul, and fellow traveller with thee to the world in\nwhich there is no parting and no death.\u0094\n\nI could not but be deeply affected by the tenderness, at once so pure\nand so impassioned, with which these words were uttered, and in a voice\nthat would have rendered musical the roughest sounds in the rudest\ntongue. And for a moment it did occur to me that I might avail myself of\nZee\u0092s agency to effect a safe and speedy return to the upper world. But\na very brief space for reflection sufficed to show me how dishonourable\nand base a return for such devotion it would be to allure thus away,\nfrom her own people and a home in which I had been so hospitably\ntreated, a creature to whom our world would be so abhorrent, and\nfor whose barren, if spiritual love, I could not reconcile myself to\nrenounce the more human affection of mates less exalted above my erring\nself. With this sentiment of duty towards the Gy combined another of\nduty towards the whole race I belonged to. Could I venture to introduce\ninto the upper world a being so formidably gifted--a being that with a\nmovement of her staff could in less than an hour reduce New York and its\nglorious Koom-Posh into a pinch of snuff? Rob her of her staff, with\nher science she could easily construct another; and with the deadly\nlightnings that armed the slender engine her whole frame was charged. If\nthus dangerous to the cities and populations of the whole upper earth,\ncould she be a safe companion to myself in case her affection should be\nsubjected to change or embittered by jealousy? These thoughts, which\nit takes so many words to express, passed rapidly through my brain and\ndecided my answer.\n\n\u0093Zee,\u0094 I said, in the softest tones I could command and pressing\nrespectful lips on the hand into whose clasp mine vanished--\u0093Zee, I\ncan find no words to say how deeply I am touched, and how highly I am\nhonoured, by a love so disinterested and self-immolating. My best return\nto it is perfect frankness. Each nation has its customs. The customs\nof yours do not allow you to wed me; the customs of mine are equally\nopposed to such a union between those of races so widely differing. On\nthe other hand, though not deficient in courage among my own people, or\namid dangers with which I am familiar, I cannot, without a shudder of\nhorror, think of constructing a bridal home in the heart of some dismal\nchaos, with all the elements of nature, fire and water, and mephitic\ngases, at war with each other, and with the probability that at some\nmoment, while you were busied in cleaving rocks or conveying vril into\nlamps, I should be devoured by a krek which your operations disturbed\nfrom its hiding-place. I, a mere Tish, do not deserve the love of a Gy,\nso brilliant, so learned, so potent as yourself. Yes, I do not deserve\nthat love, for I cannot return it.\u0094\n\nZee released my hand, rose to her feet, and turned her face away to hide\nher emotions; then she glided noiselessly along the room, and paused at\nthe threshold. Suddenly, impelled as by a new thought, she returned to\nmy side and said, in a whispered tone,--\n\n\u0093You told me you would speak with perfect frankness. With perfect\nfrankness, then, answer me this question. If you cannot love me, do you\nlove another?\u0094\n\n\u0093Certainly, I do not.\u0094\n\n\u0093You do not love Taee\u0092s sister?\u0094\n\n\u0093I never saw her before last night.\u0094 \u0093That is no answer. Love is swifter\nthan vril. You hesitate to tell me. Do not think it is only jealousy\nthat prompts me to caution you. If the Tur\u0092s daughter should declare\nlove to you--if in her ignorance she confides to her father any\npreference that may justify his belief that she will woo you, he will\nhave no option but to request your immediate destruction, as he is\nspecially charged with the duty of consulting the good of the community,\nwhich could not allow the daughter of the Vril-ya to wed a son of the\nTish-a, in that sense of marriage which does not confine itself to union\nof the souls. Alas! there would then be for you no escape. She has\nno strength of wing to uphold you through the air; she has no science\nwherewith to make a home in the wilderness. Believe that here my\nfriendship speaks, and that my jealousy is silent.\u0094\n\nWith these words Zee left me. And recalling those words, I thought no\nmore of succeeding to the throne of the Vril-ya, or of the political,\nsocial, and moral reforms I should institute in the capacity of Absolute\nSovereign.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVI.\n\n\nAfter the conversation with Zee just recorded, I fell into a profound\nmelancholy. The curious interest with which I had hitherto examined the\nlife and habits of this marvellous community was at an end. I could not\nbanish from my mind the consciousness that I was among a people who,\nhowever kind and courteous, could destroy me at any moment without\nscruple or compunction. The virtuous and peaceful life of the\npeople which, while new to me, had seemed so holy a contrast to the\ncontentions, the passions, the vices of the upper world, now began\nto oppress me with a sense of dulness and monotony. Even the serene\ntranquility of the lustrous air preyed on my spirits. I longed for a\nchange, even to winter, or storm, or darkness. I began to feel that,\nwhatever our dreams of perfectibility, our restless aspirations towards\na better, and higher, and calmer, sphere of being, we, the mortals of\nthe upper world, are not trained or fitted to enjoy for long the very\nhappiness of which we dream or to which we aspire.\n\nNow, in this social state of the Vril-ya, it was singular to mark how\nit contrived to unite and to harmonise into one system nearly all the\nobjects which the various philosophers of the upper world have placed\nbefore human hopes as the ideals of a Utopian future. It was a state in\nwhich war, with all its calamities, was deemed impossible,--a state in\nwhich the freedom of all and each was secured to the uttermost degree,\nwithout one of those animosities which make freedom in the upper world\ndepend on the perpetual strife of hostile parties. Here the corruption\nwhich debases democracies was as unknown as the discontents which\nundermine the thrones of monarchies. Equality here was not a name; it\nwas a reality. Riches were not persecuted, because they were not envied.\nHere those problems connected with the labours of a working class,\nhitherto insoluble above ground, and above ground conducing to such\nbitterness between classes, were solved by a process the simplest,--a\ndistinct and separate working class was dispensed with altogether.\nMechanical inventions, constructed on the principles that baffled my\nresearch to ascertain, worked by an agency infinitely more powerful and\ninfinitely more easy of management than aught we have yet extracted from\nelectricity or steam, with the aid of children whose strength was\nnever overtasked, but who loved their employment as sport and pastime,\nsufficed to create a Public-wealth so devoted to the general use that\nnot a grumbler was ever heard of. The vices that rot our cities here\nhad no footing. Amusements abounded, but they were all innocent. No\nmerry-makings conduced to intoxication, to riot, to disease. Love\nexisted, and was ardent in pursuit, but its object, once secured, was\nfaithful. The adulterer, the profligate, the harlot, were phenomena so\nunknown in this commonwealth, that even to find the words by which they\nwere designated one would have had to search throughout an obsolete\nliterature composed thousands of years before. They who have been\nstudents of theoretical philosophies above ground, know that all these\nstrange departures from civilised life do but realise ideas which have\nbeen broached, canvassed, ridiculed, contested for; sometimes partially\ntried, and still put forth in fantastic books, but have never come\nto practical result. Nor were these all the steps towards theoretical\nperfectibility which this community had made. It had been the sober\nbelief of Descartes that the life of man could be prolonged, not,\nindeed, on this earth, to eternal duration, but to what he called the\nage of the patriarchs, and modestly defined to be from 100 to 150 years\naverage length. Well, even this dream of sages was here fulfilled--nay,\nmore than fulfilled; for the vigour of middle life was preserved even\nafter the term of a century was passed. With this longevity was combined\na greater blessing than itself--that of continuous health. Such diseases\nas befell the race were removed with ease by scientific applications of\nthat agency--life-giving as life-destroying--which is inherent in vril.\nEven this idea is not unknown above ground, though it has generally\nbeen confined to enthusiasts or charlatans, and emanates from confused\nnotions about mesmerism, odic force, &c. Passing by such trivial\ncontrivances as wings, which every schoolboy knows has been tried and\nfound wanting, from the mythical or pre-historical period, I proceed to\nthat very delicate question, urged of late as essential to the perfect\nhappiness of our human species by the two most disturbing and potential\ninfluences on upper-ground society,--Womankind and Philosophy. I mean,\nthe Rights of Women.\n\nNow, it is allowed by jurisprudists that it is idle to talk of rights\nwhere there are not corresponding powers to enforce them; and above\nground, for some reason or other, man, in his physical force, in the use\nof weapons offensive and defensive, when it come to positive personal\ncontest, can, as a rule of general application, master women. But among\nthis people there can be no doubt about the rights of women, because, as\nI have before said, the Gy, physically speaking, is bigger and stronger\nthan the An; and her will being also more resolute than his, and will\nbeing essential to the direction of the vril force, she can bring to\nbear upon him, more potently than he on herself, the mystical agency\nwhich art can extract from the occult properties of nature. Therefore\nall that our female philosophers above ground contend for as to rights\nof women, is conceded as a matter of course in this happy commonwealth.\nBesides such physical powers, the Gy-ei have (at least in youth) a keen\ndesire for accomplishments and learning which exceeds that of the male;\nand thus they are the scholars, the professors--the learned portion, in\nshort, of the community.\n\nOf course, in this state of society the female establishes, as I have\nshown, her most valued privilege, that of choosing and courting her\nwedding partner. Without that privilege she would despise all the\nothers. Now, above ground, we should not unreasonably apprehend that a\nfemale, thus potent and thus privileged, when she had fairly hunted us\ndown and married us, would be very imperious and tyrannical. Not so with\nthe Gy-ei: once married, the wings once suspended, and more amiable,\ncomplacent, docile mates, more sympathetic, more sinking their loftier\ncapacities into the study of their husbands\u0092 comparatively frivolous\ntastes and whims, no poet could conceive in his visions of conjugal\nbliss. Lastly, among the more important characteristics of the Vril-ya,\nas distinguished from our mankind--lastly, and most important on the\nbearings of their life and the peace of their commonwealths, is their\nuniversal agreement in the existence of a merciful beneficent Diety, and\nof a future world to the duration of which a century or two are moments\ntoo brief to waste upon thoughts of fame and power and avarice; while\nwith that agreement is combined another--viz., since they can know\nnothing as to the nature of that Diety beyond the fact of His supreme\ngoodness, nor of that future world beyond the fact of its felicitous\nexistence, so their reason forbids all angry disputes on insoluble\nquestions. Thus they secure for that state in the bowels of the earth\nwhat no community ever secured under the light of the stars--all the\nblessings and consolations of a religion without any of the evils and\ncalamities which are engendered by strife between one religion and\nanother.\n\nIt would be, then, utterly impossible to deny that the state of\nexistence among the Vril-ya is thus, as a whole, immeasurably more\nfelicitous than that of super-terrestrial races, and, realising the\ndreams of our most sanguine philanthropists, almost approaches to a\npoet\u0092s conception of some angelical order. And yet, if you would take\na thousand of the best and most philosophical of human beings you could\nfind in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, or even Boston, and place them\nas citizens in the beatified community, my belief is, that in less than\na year they would either die of ennui, or attempt some revolution by\nwhich they would militate against the good of the community, and be\nburnt into cinders at the request of the Tur.\n\nCertainly I have no desire to insinuate, through the medium of this\nnarrative, any ignorant disparagement of the race to which I belong. I\nhave, on the contrary, endeavoured to make it clear that the principles\nwhich regulate the social system of the Vril-ya forbid them to produce\nthose individual examples of human greatness which adorn the annals of\nthe upper world. Where there are no wars there can be no Hannibal, no\nWashington, no Jackson, no Sheridan;--where states are so happy that\nthey fear no danger and desire no change, they cannot give birth to a\nDemosthenes, a Webster, a Sumner, a Wendell Holmes, or a Butler; and\nwhere a society attains to a moral standard, in which there are no\ncrimes and no sorrows from which tragedy can extract its aliment of pity\nand sorrow, no salient vices or follies on which comedy can lavish its\nmirthful satire, it has lost the chance of producing a Shakespeare, or\na Moliere, or a Mrs. Beecher-Stowe. But if I have no desire to disparage\nmy fellow-men above ground in showing how much the motives that impel\nthe energies and ambition of individuals in a society of contest and\nstruggle--become dormant or annulled in a society which aims at securing\nfor the aggregate the calm and innocent felicity which we presume to be\nthe lot of beatified immortals; neither, on the other hand, have I the\nwish to represent the commonwealths of the Vril-ya as an ideal form of\npolitical society, to the attainment of which our own efforts of reform\nshould be directed. On the contrary, it is because we have so combined,\nthroughout the series of ages, the elements which compose human\ncharacter, that it would be utterly impossible for us to adopt the modes\nof life, or to reconcile our passions to the modes of thought among\nthe Vril-ya,--that I arrived at the conviction that this people--though\noriginally not only of our human race, but, as seems to me clear by the\nroots of their language, descended from the same ancestors as the Great\nAryan family, from which in varied streams has flowed the dominant\ncivilisation of the world; and having, according to their myths\nand their history, passed through phases of society familiar to\nourselves,--had yet now developed into a distinct species with which it\nwas impossible that any community in the upper world could amalgamate:\nand that if they ever emerged from these nether recesses into the light\nof day, they would, according to their own traditional persuasions of\ntheir ultimate destiny, destroy and replace our existent varieties of\nman.\n\nIt may, indeed, be said, since more than one Gy could be found to\nconceive a partiality for so ordinary a type of our super-terrestrial\nrace as myself, that even if the Vril-ya did appear above ground, we\nmight be saved from extermination by intermixture of race. But this is\ntoo sanguine a belief. Instances of such \u0091mesalliance\u0092 would be as rare\nas those of intermarriage between the Anglo-Saxon emigrants and the\nRed Indians. Nor would time be allowed for the operation of familiar\nintercourse. The Vril-ya, on emerging, induced by the charm of a sunlit\nheaven to form their settlements above ground, would commence at once\nthe work of destruction, seize upon the territories already cultivated,\nand clear off, without scruple, all the inhabitants who resisted\nthat invasion. And considering their contempt for the institutions of\nKoom-Posh or Popular Government, and the pugnacious valour of my\nbeloved countrymen, I believe that if the Vril-ya first appeared in free\nAmerica--as, being the choicest portion of the habitable earth, they\nwould doubtless be induced to do--and said, \u0093This quarter of the globe\nwe take; Citizens of a Koom-Posh, make way for the development of\nspecies in the Vril-ya,\u0094 my brave compatriots would show fight, and not\na soul of them would be left in this life, to rally round the Stars and\nStripes, at the end of a week.\n\nI now saw but little of Zee, save at meals, when the family assembled,\nand she was then reserved and silent. My apprehensions of danger from an\naffection I had so little encouraged or deserved, therefore, now faded\naway, but my dejection continued to increase. I pined for escape to the\nupper world, but I racked my brains in vain for any means to effect it.\nI was never permitted to wander forth alone, so that I could not even\nvisit the spot on which I had alighted, and see if it were possible to\nreascend to the mine. Nor even in the Silent Hours, when the household\nwas locked in sleep, could I have let myself down from the lofty floor\nin which my apartment was placed. I knew not how to command the automata\nwho stood mockingly at my beck beside the wall, nor could I ascertain\nthe springs by which were set in movement the platforms that supplied\nthe place of stairs. The knowledge how to avail myself of these\ncontrivances had been purposely withheld from me. Oh, that I could but\nhave learned the use of wings, so freely here at the service of every\ninfant, then I might have escaped from the casement, regained the rocks,\nand buoyed myself aloft through the chasm of which the perpendicular\nsides forbade place for human footing!\n\n\n\nChapter XXVII.\n\n\nOne day, as I sat alone and brooding in my chamber, Taee flew in at the\nopen window and alighted on the couch beside me. I was always pleased\nwith the visits of a child, in whose society, if humbled, I was less\neclipsed than in that of Ana who had completed their education and\nmatured their understanding. And as I was permitted to wander forth with\nhim for my companion, and as I longed to revisit the spot in which I\nhad descended into the nether world, I hastened to ask him if he were\nat leisure for a stroll beyond the streets of the city. His countenance\nseemed to me graver than usual as he replied, \u0093I came hither on purpose\nto invite you forth.\u0094\n\nWe soon found ourselves in the street, and had not got far from the\nhouse when we encountered five or six young Gy-ei, who were returning\nfrom the fields with baskets full of flowers, and chanting a song in\nchorus as they walked. A young Gy sings more often than she talks. They\nstopped on seeing us, accosting Taee with familiar kindness, and me with\nthe courteous gallantry which distinguishes the Gy-ei in their manner\ntowards our weaker sex.\n\nAnd here I may observe that, though a virgin Gy is so frank in\nher courtship to the individual she favours, there is nothing that\napproaches to that general breadth and loudness of manner which those\nyoung ladies of the Anglo-Saxon race, to whom the distinguished epithet\nof \u0091fast\u0092 is accorded, exhibit towards young gentlemen whom they do not\nprofess to love. No; the bearing of the Gy-ei towards males in ordinary\nis very much that of high-bred men in the gallant societies of the upper\nworld towards ladies whom they respect but do not woo; deferential,\ncomplimentary, exquisitely polished--what we should call \u0091chivalrous.\u0092\n\nCertainly I was a little put out by the number of civil things addressed\nto my \u0091amour propre,\u0092 which were said to me by those courteous young\nGy-ei. In the world I came from, a man would have thought himself\naggrieved, treated with irony, \u0091chaffed\u0092 (if so vulgar a slang word\nmay be allowed on the authority of the popular novelists who use it\nso freely), when one fair Gy complimented me on the freshness of my\ncomplexion, another on the choice of colours in my dress, a third, with\na sly smile, on the conquests I had made at Aph-Lin\u0092s entertainment. But\nI knew already that all such language was what the French call \u0091banal,\u0092\nand did but express in the female mouth, below earth, that sort of\ndesire to pass for amiable with the opposite sex which, above earth,\narbitrary custom and hereditary transmission demonstrate by the mouth of\nthe male. And just as a high-bred young lady, above earth, habituated\nto such compliments, feels that she cannot, without impropriety, return\nthem, nor evince any great satisfaction at receiving them; so I who\nhad learned polite manners at the house of so wealthy and dignified\na Minister of that nation, could but smile and try to look pretty in\nbashfully disclaiming the compliments showered upon me. While we were\nthus talking, Taee\u0092s sister, it seems, had seen us from the upper rooms\nof the Royal Palace at the entrance of the town, and, precipitating\nherself on her wings, alighted in the midst of the group.\n\nSingling me out, she said, though still with the inimitable deference\nof manner which I have called \u0091chivalrous,\u0092 yet not without a certain\nabruptness of tone which, as addressed to the weaker sex, Sir Philip\nSydney might have termed \u0091rustic,\u0092 \u0093Why do you never come to see\nus?\u0094 While I was deliberating on the right answer to give to this\nunlooked-for question, Taee said quickly and sternly, \u0093Sister, you\nforget--the stranger is of my sex. It is not for persons of my sex,\nhaving due regard for reputation and modesty, to lower themselves by\nrunning after the society of yours.\u0094\n\nThis speech was received with evident approval by the young Gy-ei in\ngeneral; but Taee\u0092s sister looked greatly abashed. Poor thing!--and a\nPRINCESS too!\n\nJust at this moment a shadow fell on the space between me and the group;\nand, turning round, I beheld the chief magistrate coming close upon us,\nwith the silent and stately pace peculiar to the Vril-ya. At the sight\nof his countenance, the same terror which had seized me when I first\nbeheld it returned. On that brow, in those eyes, there was that same\nindefinable something which marked the being of a race fatal to our\nown--that strange expression of serene exemption from our common cares\nand passions, of conscious superior power, compassionate and inflexible\nas that of a judge who pronounces doom. I shivered, and, inclining low,\npressed the arm of my child-friend, and drew him onward silently. The\nTur placed himself before our path, regarded me for a moment without\nspeaking, then turned his eye quietly on his daughter\u0092s face, and, with\na grave salutation to her and the other Gy-ei, went through the midst of\nthe group,--still without a word.\n\n\n\nChapter XXVIII.\n\n\nWhen Taee and I found ourselves alone on the broad road that lay between\nthe city and the chasm through which I had descended into this region\nbeneath the light of the stars and sun, I said under my breath, \u0093Child\nand friend, there is a look in your father\u0092s face which appals me. I\nfeel as if, in its awful tranquillity, I gazed upon death.\u0094\n\nTaee did not immediately reply. He seemed agitated, and as if debating\nwith himself by what words to soften some unwelcome intelligence. At\nlast he said, \u0093None of the Vril-ya fear death: do you?\u0094\n\n\u0093The dread of death is implanted in the breasts of the race to which I\nbelong. We can conquer it at the call of duty, of honour, of love. We\ncan die for a truth, for a native land, for those who are dearer to us\nthan ourselves. But if death do really threaten me now and here, where\nare such counteractions to the natural instinct which invests with awe\nand terror the contemplation of severance between soul and body?\u0094\n\nTaee looked surprised, but there was great tenderness in his voice as\nhe replied, \u0093I will tell my father what you say. I will entreat him to\nspare your life.\u0094\n\n\u0093He has, then, already decreed to destroy it?\u0094\n\n\u0093\u0091Tis my sister\u0092s fault or folly,\u0094 said Taee, with some petulance.\n\u0093But she spoke this morning to my father; and, after she had spoken,\nhe summoned me, as a chief among the children who are commissioned to\ndestroy such lives as threaten the community, and he said to me, \u0091Take\nthy vril staff, and seek the stranger who has made himself dear to thee.\nBe his end painless and prompt.\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093And,\u0094 I faltered, recoiling from the child--\u0093and it is, then, for my\nmurder that thus treacherously thou hast invited me forth? No, I cannot\nbelieve it. I cannot think thee guilty of such a crime.\u0094\n\n\u0093It is no crime to slay those who threaten the good of the community; it\nwould be a crime to slay the smallest insect that cannot harm us.\u0094\n\n\u0093If you mean that I threaten the good of the community because your\nsister honours me with the sort of preference which a child may feel for\na strange plaything, it is not necessary to kill me. Let me return to\nthe people I have left, and by the chasm through which I descended. With\na slight help from you I might do so now. You, by the aid of your wings,\ncould fasten to the rocky ledge within the chasm the cord that you\nfound, and have no doubt preserved. Do but that; assist me but to the\nspot from which I alighted, and I vanish from your world for ever, and\nas surely as if I were among the dead.\u0094\n\n\u0093The chasm through which you descended! Look round; we stand now on the\nvery place where it yawned. What see you? Only solid rock. The chasm was\nclosed, by the orders of Aph-Lin, as soon as communication between him\nand yourself was established in your trance, and he learned from\nyour own lips the nature of the world from which you came. Do you not\nremember when Zee bade me not question you as to yourself or your\nrace? On quitting you that day, Aph-Lin accosted me, and said, \u0091No path\nbetween the stranger\u0092s home and ours should be left unclosed, or the\nsorrow and evil of his home may descend to ours. Take with thee the\nchildren of thy band, smite the sides of the cavern with your vril\nstaves till the fall of their fragments fills up every chink through\nwhich a gleam of our lamps could force its way.\u0092\u0094\n\nAs the child spoke, I stared aghast at the blind rocks before me. Huge\nand irregular, the granite masses, showing by charred discolouration\nwhere they had been shattered, rose from footing to roof-top; not a\ncranny!\n\n\u0093All hope, then, is gone,\u0094 I murmured, sinking down on the craggy\nwayside, \u0093and I shall nevermore see the sun.\u0094 I covered my face with my\nhands, and prayed to Him whose presence I had so often forgotten when\nthe heavens had declared His handiwork. I felt His presence in the\ndepths of the nether earth, and amidst the world of the grave. I looked\nup, taking comfort and courage from my prayers, and, gazing with a quiet\nsmile into the face of the child, said, \u0093Now, if thou must slay me,\nstrike.\u0094\n\nTaee shook his head gently. \u0093Nay,\u0094 he said, \u0093my father\u0092s request is not\nso formally made as to leave me no choice. I will speak with him, and\nmay prevail to save thee. Strange that thou shouldst have that fear of\ndeath which we thought was only the instinct of the inferior creatures,\nto whom the convictions of another life has not been vouchsafed.\nWith us, not an infant knows such a fear. Tell me, my dear Tish,\u0094\n he continued after a little pause, \u0093would it reconcile thee more to\ndeparture from this form of life to that form which lies on the other\nside of the moment called \u0091death,\u0092 did I share thy journey? If so, I\nwill ask my father whether it be allowable for me to go with thee. I am\none of our generation destined to emigrate, when of age for it, to some\nregions unknown within this world. I would just as soon emigrate now to\nregions unknown, in another world. The All-Good is no less there than\nhere. Where is he not?\u0094\n\n\u0093Child,\u0094 said I, seeing by Taee\u0092s countenance that he spoke in serious\nearnest, \u0093it is crime in thee to slay me; it were a crime not less in\nme to say, \u0091Slay thyself.\u0092 The All-Good chooses His own time to give us\nlife, and his own time to take it away. Let us go back. If, on speaking\nwith thy father, he decides on my death, give me the longest warning in\nthy power, so that I may pass the interval in self-preparation.\u0094\n\n\n\nChapter XXIX.\n\n\nIn the midst of those hours set apart for sleep and constituting the\nnight of the Vril-ya, I was awakened from the disturbed slumber into\nwhich I had not long fallen, by a hand on my shoulder. I started and\nbeheld Zee standing beside me. \u0093Hush,\u0094 she said in a whisper; \u0093let no\none hear us. Dost thou think that I have ceased to watch over thy safety\nbecause I could not win thy love? I have seen Taee. He has not prevailed\nwith his father, who had meanwhile conferred with the three sages who,\nin doubtful matters, he takes into council, and by their advice he has\nordained thee to perish when the world re-awakens to life. I will save\nthee. Rise and dress.\u0094\n\nZee pointed to a table by the couch on which I saw the clothes I had\nworn on quitting the upper world, and which I had exchanged subsequently\nfor the more picturesque garments of the Vril-ya. The young Gy then\nmoved towards the casement and stepped into the balcony, while hastily\nand wonderingly I donned my own habiliments. When I joined her on the\nbalcony, her face was pale and rigid. Taking me by the hand, she said\nsoftly, \u0093See how brightly the art of the Vril-ya has lighted up the\nworld in which they dwell. To-morrow the world will be dark to me.\u0094 She\ndrew me back into the room without waiting for my answer, thence into\nthe corridor, from which we descended into the hall. We passed into the\ndeserted streets and along the broad upward road which wound beneath the\nrocks. Here, where there is neither day nor night, the Silent Hours\nare unutterably solemn--the vast space illumined by mortal skill is\nso wholly without the sight and stir of mortal life. Soft as were\nour footsteps, their sounds vexed the ear, as out of harmony with the\nuniversal repose. I was aware in my own mind, though Zee said it not,\nthat she had decided to assist my return to the upper world, and that\nwe were bound towards the place from which I had descended. Her silence\ninfected me and commanded mine. And now we approached the chasm. It had\nbeen re-opened; not presenting, indeed, the same aspect as when I had\nemerged from it, but through that closed wall of rock before which I\nhad last stood with Taee, a new clift had been riven, and along its\nblackened sides still glimmered sparks and smouldered embers. My\nupward gaze could not, however, penetrate more than a few feet into the\ndarkness of the hollow void, and I stood dismayed, and wondering how\nthat grim ascent was to be made.\n\nZee divined my doubt. \u0093Fear not,\u0094 said she, with a faint smile; \u0093your\nreturn is assured. I began this work when the Silent Hours commenced,\nand all else were asleep; believe that I did not paused till the path\nback into thy world was clear. I shall be with thee a little while yet.\nWe do not part until thou sayest, \u0091Go, for I need thee no more.\u0092\u0094\n\nMy heart smote me with remorse at these words. \u0093Ah!\u0094 I exclaimed, \u0093would\nthat thou wert of my race or I of thine, then I should never say, \u0091I\nneed thee no more.\u0092\u0094\n\n\u0093I bless thee for those words, and I shall remember them when thou art\ngone,\u0094 answered the Gy, tenderly.\n\nDuring this brief interchange of words, Zee had turned away from me, her\nform bent and her head bowed over her breast. Now, she rose to the full\nheight of her grand stature, and stood fronting me. While she had been\nthus averted from my gaze, she had lighted up the circlet that she wore\nround her brow, so that it blazed as if it were a crown of stars. Not\nonly her face and her form, but the atmosphere around, were illumined by\nthe effulgence of the diadem.\n\n\u0093Now,\u0094 said she, \u0093put thine arm around me for the first and last time.\nNay, thus; courage, and cling firm.\u0094\n\nAs she spoke her form dilated, the vast wings expanded. Clinging to her,\nI was borne aloft through the terrible chasm. The starry light from her\nforehead shot around and before us through the darkness. Brightly and\nsteadfastly, and swiftly as an angel may soar heavenward with the soul\nit rescues from the grave, went the flight of the Gy, till I heard\nin the distance the hum of human voices, the sounds of human toil. We\nhalted on the flooring of one of the galleries of the mine, and beyond,\nin the vista, burned the dim, feeble lamps of the miners. Then I\nreleased my hold. The Gy kissed me on my forehead, passionately, but as\nwith a mother\u0092s passion, and said, as the tears gushed from her eyes,\n\u0093Farewell for ever. Thou wilt not let me go into thy world--thou canst\nnever return to mine. Ere our household shake off slumber, the rocks\nwill have again closed over the chasm not to be re-opened by me, nor\nperhaps by others, for ages yet unguessed. Think of me sometimes, and\nwith kindness. When I reach the life that lies beyond this speck in\ntime, I shall look round for thee. Even there, the world consigned to\nthyself and thy people may have rocks and gulfs which divide it from\nthat in which I rejoin those of my race that have gone before, and I may\nbe powerless to cleave way to regain thee as I have cloven way to lose.\u0094\n\nHer voice ceased. I heard the swan-like sough of her wings, and saw the\nrays of her starry diadem receding far and farther through the gloom.\n\nI sate myself down for some time, musing sorrowfully; then I rose and\ntook my way with slow footsteps towards the place in which I heard the\nsounds of men. The miners I encountered were strange to me, of another\nnation than my own. They turned to look at me with some surprise, but\nfinding that I could not answer their brief questions in their own\nlanguage, they returned to their work and suffered me to pass on\nunmolested. In fine, I regained the mouth of the mine, little troubled\nby other interrogatories;--save those of a friendly official to whom I\nwas known, and luckily he was too busy to talk much with me. I took care\nnot to return to my former lodging, but hastened that very day to quit\na neighbourhood where I could not long have escaped inquiries to which\nI could have given no satisfactory answers. I regained in safety my own\ncountry, in which I have been long peacefully settled, and engaged in\npractical business, till I retired on a competent fortune, three years\nago. I have been little invited and little tempted to talk of the\nrovings and adventures of my youth. Somewhat disappointed, as most men\nare, in matters connected with household love and domestic life, I often\nthink of the young Gy as I sit alone at night, and wonder how I could\nhave rejected such a love, no matter what dangers attended it, or by\nwhat conditions it was restricted. Only, the more I think of a people\ncalmly developing, in regions excluded from our sight and deemed\nuninhabitable by our sages, powers surpassing our most disciplined modes\nof force, and virtues to which our life, social and political, becomes\nantagonistic in proportion as our civilisation advances,--the more\ndevoutly I pray that ages may yet elapse before there emerge into\nsunlight our inevitable destroyers. Being, however, frankly told by\nmy physician that I am afflicted by a complaint which, though it gives\nlittle pain and no perceptible notice of its encroachments, may at any\nmoment be fatal, I have thought it my duty to my fellow-men to place on\nrecord these forewarnings of The Coming Race.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Coming Race, by Edward Bulwer Lytton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COMING RACE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1951-0.txt or 1951-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/9\/5\/1951\/\n\nProduced by Fred Ihde and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u0092s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u0092s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\u0092s laws.\n\nThe Foundation\u0092s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\u0092s web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1341,"split":"test"}
