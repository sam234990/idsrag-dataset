She has been commissioned to bring about the signing of a secret contract, in the capital of the enemy, by representatives of all countries involved, both European and American. Her brother, an inventor, has devised a secret weapon by which missiles can be fired from submarines (see also depth charge) which will, it is hoped, secure military domination over the rest of the world.\nMembers of the U.S. Secret Service, who have been alerted, are assigned to prevent the signing of this \"Latin compact\" and bring to justice those involved who have no diplomatic immunity. One young representative named Grimm, however, although absolutely loyal to his government, falls in love with the beautiful foreign agent, Thorne.\nIn the end Thorne, who reciprocates her admirer's love, becomes estranged from her employer, the Italian government, because she does not want Grimm, who has been captured by the conspirators and knows all their secrets, to be murdered. Stripped of all her power and possessions, she unites with him at the end of the novel, no longer elusive.\nA trivial novel in its time, Elusive Isabel is now in the public domain.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Elusive Isabel, by Jacques Futrelle\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Outwardly it is merely a city\nof evasion, of conventionalities, sated with the commonplace pleasures\nof life, listless, blas\u00c3\u00a9 even, and always exquisitely, albeit frigidly,\ncourteous; but beneath the still, suave surface strange currents play at\ncross purposes, intrigue is endless, and the merciless war of diplomacy\ngoes on unceasingly. Occasionally, only occasionally, a bubble comes to\nthe surface, and when it bursts the echo goes crashing around the earth.\nSometimes a dynasty is shaken, a nation trembles, a ministry topples\nover; but the ripple moves and all is placid again. No man may know all\nthat happens there, for then he would be diplomatic master of the\nworld.\n\n\"There is plenty of red blood in Washington,\" remarked a jesting\nlegislative gray-beard, once upon a time, \"but it's always frozen before\nthey put it in circulation. Diplomatic negotiations are conducted in the\ndrawing-room, but long before that the fight is fought down cellar. The\ndiplomatists meet at table and there isn't any broken crockery, but you\ncan always tell what the player thinks of the dealer by the way he draws\nthree cards. Everybody is after results; and lots of monarchs of Europe\nsit up nights polishing their crowns waiting for word from Washington.\"\n\nSo, this is Washington! And here at dinner are the diplomatic\nrepresentatives of all the nations. That is the British ambassador, that\nstolid-faced, distinguished-looking, elderly man; and this is the French\nambassador, dapper, volatile, plus-correct; here Russia's highest\nrepresentative wags a huge, blond beard; and yonder is the phlegmatic\nGerman ambassador. Scattered around the table, brilliant splotches of\ncolor, are the uniformed envoys of the Orient--the smaller the country\nthe more brilliant the splotch. It is a state dinner, to be followed by\na state ball, and they are all present.\n\nThe Italian ambassador, Count di Rosini, was trying to interpret a\nFrench _bon mot_ into English for the benefit of the dainty, doll-like\nwife of the Chinese minister--who was educated at Radcliffe--when a\nservant leaned over him and laid a sealed envelope beside his plate. The\ncount glanced around at the servant, excused himself to Mrs. Quong Li\nWi, and opened the envelope. Inside was a single sheet of embassy note\npaper, and a terse line signed by his secretary:\n\n\"A lady is waiting for you here. She says she must see you immediately,\non a matter of the greatest importance.\"\n\nThe count read the note twice, with wrinkled brow, then scribbled on it\nin pencil:\n\n\"Impossible to-night. Tell her to call at the embassy to-morrow morning\nat half-past ten o'clock.\"\n\nHe folded the note, handed it to the servant, and resumed his\nconversation with Mrs. Wi.\n\nHalf an hour later the same servant placed a second sealed envelope\nbeside his plate. Recognizing the superscription, the ambassador\nimpatiently shoved it aside, intending to disregard it. But irritated\ncuriosity finally triumphed, and he opened it. A white card on which was\nwritten this command was his reward:\n\n\"It is necessary that you come to the embassy at once.\"\n\nThere was no signature. The handwriting was unmistakably that of a\nwoman, and just as unmistakably strange to him. He frowned a little as\nhe stared at it wonderingly, then idly turned the card over. There was\nno name on the reverse side--only a crest. Evidently the count\nrecognized this, for his impassive face reflected surprise for an\ninstant, and this was followed by a keen, bewildered interest. Finally\nhe arose, made his apologies, and left the room. His automobile was at\nthe door.\n\n[Illustration: The handwriting was unmistakably that of a woman.]\n\n\"To the embassy,\" he directed the chauffeur.\n\nAnd within five minutes he was there. His secretary met him in the hall.\n\n\"The lady is waiting in your office,\" he explained apologetically. \"I\ngave her your message, but she said she must see you and would write you\na line herself. I sent it.\"\n\n\"Quite correct,\" commented the ambassador. \"What name did she give?\"\n\n\"None,\" was the reply. \"She said none was necessary.\"\n\nThe ambassador laid aside hat and coat and entered his office with a\nslightly puzzled expression on his face. Standing before a window,\ngazing idly out into the light-spangled night, was a young woman, rather\ntall and severely gowned in some rich, glistening stuff which fell away\nsheerly from her splendid bare shoulders. She turned and he found\nhimself looking into a pair of clear, blue-gray eyes, frank enough and\nyet in their very frankness possessing an alluring, indefinable\nsubtlety. He would not have called her pretty, yet her smile, slight as\nit was, was singularly charming, and there radiated from her a\nsomething--personality, perhaps--which held his glance. He bowed low,\nand closed the door.\n\n\"I am at your service, Madam,\" he said in a tone of deep respect.\n\"Please pardon my delay in coming to you.\"\n\n\"It is unfortunate that I didn't write the first note,\" she apologized\ngraciously. \"It would at least have saved a little time. You have the\ncard?\"\n\nHe produced it silently, crest down, and handed it to her. She struck a\nmatch, lighted the card, and it crumbled up in her gloved hand. The last\ntiny scrap found refuge in a silver tray, where she watched it burn to\nashes, then she turned to the ambassador with a brilliant smile. He was\nstill standing.\n\n\"The dinner isn't over yet?\" she inquired.\n\n\"No, Madam, not for another hour, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then there's no harm done,\" she went on lightly. \"The dinner isn't of\nany consequence, but I should like very much to attend the ball\nafterward. Can you arrange it for me?\"\n\n\"I don't know just how I would proceed, Madam,\" the ambassador objected\ndiffidently. \"It would be rather unusual, difficult, I may say, and--\"\n\n\"But surely you can arrange it some way?\" she interrupted demurely. \"The\nhighest diplomatic representative of a great nation should not find it\ndifficult to arrange so simple a matter as--as this?\" She was smiling.\n\n\"Pardon me for suggesting it, Madam,\" the ambassador persisted\ncourteously, \"but anything out of the usual attracts attention in\nWashington. I dare say, from the manner of your appearance to-night,\nthat you would not care to attract attention to yourself.\"\n\nShe regarded him with an enigmatic smile.\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't know women, Count,\" she said slowly, at last.\n\"There's nothing dearer to a woman's heart than to attract attention to\nherself.\" She laughed--a throaty, silvery note that was charming. \"And\nif you hesitate now, then to-morrow--why, to-morrow I am going to ask\nthat you open to me all this Washington world--this brilliant world of\ndiplomatic society. You see what I ask now is simple.\"\n\nThe ambassador was respectfully silent and deeply thoughtful for a time.\nThere was, perhaps, something of resentment struggling within him, and\ncertainly there was an uneasy feeling of rebellion at this attempt to\nthrust him forward against all precedent.\n\n\"Your requests are of so extraordinary a nature that--\" he began in\ncourteous protestation.\n\nThere was no trace of impatience in the woman's manner; she was still\nsmiling.\n\n\"It is necessary that I attend the ball to-night,\" she explained, \"you\nmay imagine how necessary when I say I sailed from Liverpool six days\nago, reaching New York at half-past three o'clock this afternoon; and at\nhalf-past four I was on my way here. I have been here less than one\nhour. I came from Liverpool especially that I might be present; and I\neven dressed on the train so there would be no delay. Now do you see the\nnecessity of it?\"\n\nDiplomatic procedure is along well-oiled grooves, and the diplomatist\nwho steps out of the rut for an instant happens upon strange and\nunexpected obstacles. Knowing this, the ambassador still hesitated. The\nwoman apparently understood.\n\n\"I had hoped that this would not be necessary,\" she remarked, and she\nproduced a small, sealed envelope. \"Please read it.\"\n\nThe ambassador received the envelope with uplifted brows, opened it and\nread what was written on a folded sheet of paper. Some subtle working\nof his brain brought a sudden change in the expression of his face.\nThere was wonder in it, and amazement, and more than these. Again he\nbowed low.\n\n\"I am at your service, Madam,\" he repeated. \"I shall take pleasure in\nmaking any arrangements that are necessary. Again, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"And it will not be so very difficult, after all, will it?\" she\ninquired, and she smiled tauntingly.\n\n\"It will not be at all difficult, Madam,\" the ambassador assured her\ngravely. \"I shall take steps at once to have an invitation issued to you\nfor to-night; and to-morrow I shall be pleased to proceed as you may\nsuggest.\"\n\nShe nodded. He folded the note, replaced it in the envelope and returned\nit to her with another deep bow. She drew her skirts about her and sat\ndown; he stood.\n\n\"It will be necessary for your name to appear on the invitation,\" the\nambassador went on to explain. \"If you will give me your name I'll have\nmy secretary--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, my name,\" she interrupted gaily. \"Why, Count, you embarrass\nme. You know, really, I have no name. Isn't it awkward?\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly, Madam,\" responded the count. \"I should have\nsaid _a_ name.\"\n\nShe meditated a moment.\n\n\"Well, say--Miss Thorne--Miss Isabel Thorne,\" she suggested at last.\n\"That will do very nicely, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Very nicely, Miss Thorne,\" and the ambassador bowed again. \"Please\nexcuse me a moment, and I'll give my secretary instructions how to\nproceed. There will be a delay of a few minutes.\"\n\nHe opened the door and went out. For a minute or more Miss Thorne sat\nperfectly still, gazing at the blank wooden panels, then she rose and\nwent to the window again. In the distance, hazy in the soft night, the\ndome of the capitol rose mistily; over to the right was the\ncongressional library, and out there where the lights sparkled lay\nPennsylvania Avenue, a thread of commerce. Miss Thorne saw it all, and\nsuddenly stretched out her arms with an all-enveloping gesture. She\nstood so for a minute, then they fell beside her, and she was\nmotionless.\n\nCount di Rosini entered.\n\n\"Everything is arranged, Miss Thorne,\" he announced. \"Will you go with\nme in my automobile, or do you prefer to go alone?\"\n\n\"I'll go alone, please,\" she answered after a moment. \"I shall be there\nabout eleven.\"\n\nThe ambassador bowed himself out.\n\nAnd so Miss Isabel Thorne came to Washington!\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nMR. CAMPBELL AND THE CABLE\n\n\nJust as it is one man's business to manufacture watches, and another\nman's business to peddle shoe-strings, so it was Mr. Campbell's business\nto know things. He was a human card index, a governmental ready\nreference posted to the minute and backed by all the tremendous\nresources of a nation. From the little office in the Secret Service\nBureau, where he sat day after day, radiating threads connected with the\nhuge outer world, and enabled him to keep a firm hand on the diplomatic\nand departmental pulse of Washington. Perhaps he came nearer knowing\neverything that happened there than any other man living; and no man\nrealized more perfectly than he just how little of all of it he did\nknow.\n\nIn person Mr. Campbell was not unlike a retired grocer who had shaken\nthe butter and eggs from his soul and settled back to enjoy a life of\nplacid idleness. He was a little beyond middle age, pleasant of face,\nwhite of hair, and blessed with guileless blue eyes. His genius had no\nsparkle to it; it consisted solely of detail and system and\nindefatigability, coupled with a memory that was well nigh infallible.\nHis brain was as serene and orderly as a cash register; one almost\nexpected to hear it click.\n\nHe sat at his desk intently studying a cable despatch which lay before\nhim. It was in the Secret Service code. Leaning over his shoulder was\nMr. Grimm--_the_ Mr. Grimm of the bureau. Mr. Grimm was an utterly\ndifferent type from his chief. He was younger, perhaps thirty-one or\ntwo, physically well proportioned, a little above the average height,\nwith regular features and listless, purposeless eyes--a replica of a\nhundred other young men who dawdle idly in the windows of their clubs\nand watch the world hurry by. His manner was languid; his dress showed\nfastidious care.\n\nSentence by sentence the bewildering intricacies of the code gave way\nbefore the placid understanding of Chief Campbell, and word by word,\nfrom the chaos of it, a translation took intelligible form upon a sheet\nof paper under his right hand. Mr. Grimm, looking on, exhibited only a\nmost perfunctory interest in the extraordinary message he was reading;\nthe listless eyes narrowed a little, that was all. It was a special\ndespatch from Lisbon dated that morning, and signed simply \"Gault.\"\nCompletely translated it ran thus:\n\n\"Secret offensive and defensive alliance of the Latin against the\nEnglish-speaking nations of the world is planned. Italy, France, Spain\nand two South American republics will soon sign compact in Washington.\nProposition just made to Portugal, and may be accepted. Special envoys\nnow working in Mexico and Central and South America. Germany invited to\njoin, but refuses as yet, giving, however, tacit support; attitude of\nRussia and Japan unknown to me. Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi, believed to\nbe in Washington at present, has absolute power to sign for Italy,\nFrance and Spain. Profound secrecy enjoined and preserved. I learned of\nit by underground. Shall I inform our minister? Cable instructions.\"\n\n\"So much!\" commented Mr. Campbell.\n\nHe clasped his hands behind his head, lay back in his chair and sat for\na long time, staring with steadfast, thoughtful eyes into the impassive\nface of his subordinate. Mr. Grimm perched himself on the edge of the\ndesk and with his legs dangling read the despatch a second time, and a\nthird.\n\n\"If,\" he observed slowly, \"if any other man than Gault had sent that I\nshould have said he was crazy.\"\n\n\"The peace of the world is in peril, Mr. Grimm,\" said Campbell\nimpressively, at last. \"It had to come, of course, the United States and\nEngland against a large part of Europe and all of Central and South\nAmerica. It had to come, and yet--!\"\n\nHe broke off abruptly, and picked up the receiver of his desk\ntelephone.\n\n\"The White House, please,\" he requested curtly, and then, after a\nmoment: \"Hello! Please ask the president if he will receive Mr. Campbell\nimmediately. Yes, Mr. Campbell of the Secret Service.\" There was a\npause. Mr. Grimm removed his immaculate person from the desk, and took a\nchair. \"Hello! In half an hour? So much!\"\n\nThe pages of the Almanac de Gotha fluttered through his fingers, and\nfinally he leaned forward and studied a paragraph of it closely. When he\nraised his eyes again there was that in them which Mr. Grimm had never\nseen before--a settled, darkening shadow.\n\n\"The world-war has long been a chimera, Mr. Grimm,\" he remarked at last,\n\"but now--now! Think of it! Of course, the Central and South American\ncountries, taken separately, are inconsequential, and that is true, too,\nof the Latin countries of Europe, except France, but taken in\ncombination, under one directing mind, the allied navies would be--would\nbe formidable, at least. Backed by the moral support of Germany, and\nperhaps Japan--! Don't you see? Don't you see?\"\n\nHe lapsed into silence. Mr. Grimm opened his lips to ask a question: Mr.\nCampbell anticipated it unerringly:\n\n\"The purpose of such an alliance? It is not too much to construe it into\nthe first step toward a world-war--a war of reprisal and conquest beside\nwhich the other great wars of the world would seem trivial. For the fact\nhas at last come home to the nations of the world that ultimately the\nEnglish-speaking peoples will dominate it--dominate it, because they are\nthe practical peoples. They have given to the world all its great\npractical inventions--the railroad, the steamship, electricity, the\ntelegraph and cable--all of them; they are the great civilizing forces,\nrounding the world up to new moral understanding, for what England has\ndone in Africa and India we have done in a smaller way in the\nPhilippines and Cuba and Porto Rico; they are the great commercial\npeoples, slowly but surely winning the market-places of the earth;\nwherever the English or the American flag is planted there the English\ntongue is being spoken, and there the peoples are being taught the\nsanity of right living and square dealing.\n\n\"It requires no great effort of the imagination, Mr. Grimm, to foresee\nthat day when the traditional power of Paris, and Berlin, and St.\nPetersburg, and Madrid will be honey-combed by the steady encroachment\nof our methods. This alliance would indicate that already that day has\nbeen foreseen; that there is now a resentment which is about to find\nexpression in one great, desperate struggle for world supremacy. A few\nhundred years ago Italy--or Rome--was stripped of her power; only\nrecently the United States dispelled the illusion that Spain was\nanything but a shell; and France--! One can't help but wonder if the\npower she boasts is not principally on paper. But if their forces are\ncombined? Do you see? It would be an enormous power to reckon with, with\na hundred bases of supplies right at our doors.\"\n\nHe rose suddenly and walked over to the window, where he stood for a\nmoment, staring out with unseeing eyes.\n\n\"Given a yard of canvas, Mr. Grimm,\" he went on finally, \"a Spanish boy\nwill waste it, a French boy will paint a picture on it, an English boy\nwill built a sail-boat, and an American boy will erect a tent. That\nfully illustrates the difference in the races.\"\n\nHe abandoned the didactic tone, and returned to the material matter in\nhand. Mr. Grimm passed him the despatch and he sat down again.\n\n\"'Will soon sign compact in Washington,'\" he read musingly. \"Now I don't\nknow that the signing of that compact can be prevented, but the signing\nof it on United States soil can be prevented. You will see to that, Mr.\nGrimm.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the young man agreed carelessly. The magnitude of such a\ntask made, apparently, not the slightest impression on him. He languidly\ndrew on his gloves.\n\n\"And meanwhile I shall take steps to ascertain the attitude of Russian\nand Japanese representatives in this city.\"\n\nMr. Grimm nodded.\n\n\"And now, for Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi,\" Mr. Campbell went on slowly.\n\"Officially he is not in Washington, nor the United States, for that\nmatter. Naturally, on such a mission, he would not come as a publicly\naccredited agent, therefore, I imagine, he is to be sought under another\nname.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Grimm acquiesced.\n\n\"And he would avoid the big hotels.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nMr. Campbell permitted his guileless blue eyes to linger inquiringly\nupon those of the young man for half a minute. He caught himself\nwondering, sometimes, at the perfection of the deliberate indifference\nwith which Mr. Grimm masked his emotions. In his admiration of this\nquality he quite overlooked the remarkable mask of benevolence behind\nwhich he himself hid.\n\n\"And the name, D'Abruzzi,\" he remarked, after a time. \"What does it mean\nto you, Mr. Grimm?\"\n\n\"It means that I am to deal with a prince of the royal blood of Italy,\"\nwas the unhesitating response. Mr. Grimm picked up the Almanac de Gotha\nand glanced at the open page. \"Of course, the first thing to do is to\nfind him; the rest will be simple enough.\" He perused the page\ncarelessly. \"I will begin work at once.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE LANGUAGE OF THE FAN\n\n\nMr. Grimm was chatting idly with Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez, daughter of the\nminister from Venezuela, the while he permitted his listless eyes to\nwander aimlessly about the spacious ball-room of the German embassy,\nablaze with festooned lights, and brilliant with a multi-colored chaos\nof uniforms. Gleaming pearl-white, translucent in the mass, were the\nbare shoulders of women; and from far off came the plaintive whine of an\norchestra, a pulsing sense rather than a living sound, of music, pointed\nhere and there by the staccato cry of a flute. A zephyr, perfumed with\nthe clean, fresh odor of lilacs, stirred the draperies of the archway\nwhich led into the conservatory and rustled the bending branches of\npalms and ferns.\n\nFor a scant instant Mr. Grimm's eyes rested on a young woman who sat a\ndozen feet away, talking, in playful animation, with an undersecretary\nof the British embassy--a young woman severely gowned in some glistening\nstuff which fell away sheerly from her splendid bare shoulders. She\nglanced up, as if in acknowledgment of his look, and her eyes met his.\nFrank, blue-gray eyes they were, stirred to their depths now by\namusement. She smiled at Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez, in token of recognition.\n\n\"Aren't they wonderful?\" asked Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez with the quick,\nbubbling enthusiasm of her race.\n\n\"What?\" asked Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"Her eyes,\" was the reply. \"Every person has one dominant feature--with\nMiss Thorne it is her eyes.\"\n\n\"Miss Thorne?\" Mr. Grimm repeated.\n\n\"Haven't you met her?\" the se\u00c3\u00b1orita went on. \"Miss Isabel Thorne? She\nonly arrived a few days ago--the night of the state ball. She's my\nguest at the legation. When an opportunity comes I shall present you to\nher.\"\n\nShe ran on, about other things, with only an occasional remark from Mr.\nGrimm, who was thoughtfully nursing his knee. Somewhere through the\nchatter and effervescent gaiety, mingling with the sound of the pulsing\nmusic, he had a singular impression of a rhythmical beat, an indistinct\ntattoo, noticeable, perhaps, only because of its monotony. After a\nmoment he shot a quick glance at Miss Thorne and understood; it was the\ntapping of an exquisitely wrought ivory fan against one of her tapering,\ngloved fingers. She was talking and smiling.\n\n\"Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot!\" said the fan.\n\nMr. Grimm twisted around in his seat and regaled his listless eyes with\na long stare into the se\u00c3\u00b1orita's pretty face. Behind the careless ease\nof repose he was mechanically isolating the faint clatter of the fan.\n\n\"Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot!\"\n\n\"Did any one ever accuse you of staring, Mr. Grimm?\" demanded the\nse\u00c3\u00b1orita banteringly.\n\nFor an instant Mr. Grimm continued to stare, and then his listless eyes\nswept the ball-room, pausing involuntarily at the scarlet splendor of\nthe minister from Turkey.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he apologized contritely. There was a pause. \"The\nminister from Turkey looks like a barn on fire, doesn't he?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez laughed, and Mr. Grimm glanced idly toward Miss\nThorne. She was still talking, her face alive with interest; and the fan\nwas still tapping rhythmically, steadily, now on the arm of her chair.\n\n\"Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot!\"\n\n\"Pretty women who don't want to be stared at should go with their faces\nswathed,\" Mr. Grimm suggested indolently. \"Haroun el Raschid there would\nagree with me on that point, I have no doubt. What a shock he would get\nif he should happen up at Atlantic City for a week-end in August!\"\n\n\"Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash-dot!\"\n\nMr. Grimm read it with perfect understanding; it was \"F--F--F\" in the\nMorse code, the call of one operator to another. Was it accident? Mr.\nGrimm wondered, and wondering he went on talking lazily:\n\n\"Curious, isn't it, the smaller the nation the more color it crowds into\nthe uniforms of its diplomatists? The British ambassador, you will\nobserve, is clothed sanely and modestly, as befits the representative of\na great nation; but coming on down by way of Spain and Italy, they get\nmore gorgeous. However, I dare say as stout a heart beats beneath a\nsky-blue sash as behind the unembellished black of evening dress.\"\n\n\"F--F--F,\" the fan was calling insistently.\n\nAnd then the answer came. It took the unexpectedly prosaic form of a\nviolent sneeze, a vociferous outburst on a bench directly behind Mr.\nGrimm. Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez jumped, then laughed nervously.\n\n\"It startled me,\" she explained.\n\n\"I think there must be a draft from the conservatory,\" said a man's\nvoice apologetically. \"Do you ladies feel it? No? Well, if you'll excuse\nme--?\"\n\nMr. Grimm glanced back languidly. The speaker was Charles Winthrop\nRankin, a brilliant young American lawyer who was attached to the German\nembassy in an advisory capacity. Among other things he was a Heidelberg\nman, having spent some dozen years of his life in Germany, where he\nestablished influential connections. Mr. Grimm knew him only by sight.\n\nAnd now the rhythmical tapping of Miss Thorne's fan underwent a change.\nThere was a flutter of gaiety in her voice the while the ivory fan\ntapped steadily.\n\n\"Dot-dot-dot! Dash! Dash-dash-dash! Dot-dot-dash! Dash!\"\n\n\"S--t--5--u--t,\" Mr. Grimm read in Morse. He laughed pleasantly at some\nremark of his companion.\n\n\"Dash-dash! Dot-dash! Dash-dot!\" said the fan.\n\n\"M--a--n,\" Mr. Grimm spelled it out, the while his listless eyes roved\naimlessly over the throng. \"S--t--5--u--t m--a--n!\" Was it meant for\n\"stout man?\" Mr. Grimm wondered.\n\n\"Dot-dash-dot! Dot! Dash-dot-dot!\"\n\n\"F--e--d,\" that was.\n\n\"Dot-dot-dash-dot! Dot-dash! Dash-dot-dash-dot! Dot!\"\n\n\"Q--a--j--e!\" Mr. Grimm was puzzled a little now, but there was not a\nwrinkle, nor the tiniest indication of perplexity in his face. Instead\nhe began talking of Raphael's cherubs, the remark being called into life\nby the high complexion of a young man who was passing. Miss Thorne\nglanced at him once keenly, her splendid eyes fairly aglow, and the fan\nrattled on in the code.\n\n\"Dash-dot! Dot! Dot-dash! Dot-dash-dot!\"\n\n\"N--e--a--f.\" Mr. Grimm was still spelling it out.\n\nThen came a perfect jumble. Mr. Grimm followed it with difficulty, a\ndifficulty utterly belied by the quizzical lines about his mouth. As he\ncaught it, it was like this: \"J--5--n--s--e--f--v--a--t--5--f,\"\nfollowed by an arbitrary signal which is not in the Morse code:\n\"Dash-dot-dash-dash!\"\n\nMr. Grimm carefully stored that jumble away in some recess of his brain,\nalong with the unknown signal.\n\n\"D--5--5--f,\" he read, and then, on to the end: \"B--f--i--n--g\n5--v--e--f w--h--e--n g g--5--e--s.\"\n\nThat was all, apparently. The soft clatter of the fan against the arm of\nthe chair ran on meaninglessly after that.\n\n\"May I bring you an ice?\" Mr. Grimm asked at last.\n\n\"If you will, please,\" responded the se\u00c3\u00b1orita, \"and when you come back\nI'll reward you by presenting you to Miss Thorne. You'll find her\ncharming; and Mr. Cadwallader has monopolized her long enough.\"\n\nMr. Grimm bowed and left her. He had barely disappeared when Mr. Rankin\nlounged along in front of Miss Thorne. He glanced at her, paused and\ngreeted her effusively.\n\n\"Why, Miss Thorne!\" he exclaimed. \"I'm delighted to see you here. I\nunderstood you would not be present, and--\"\n\nTheir hands met in a friendly clasp as she rose and moved away, with a\nnod of excuse to Mr. Cadwallader. A thin slip of paper, thrice folded,\npassed from Mr. Rankin to her. She tugged at her glove, and thrust the\nlittle paper, still folded, inside the palm.\n\n\"Is it yes, or no?\" Miss Thorne asked in a low tone.\n\n\"Frankly, I can't say,\" was the reply.\n\n\"He read the message,\" she explained hastily, \"and now he has gone to\ndecipher it.\"\n\nShe gathered up her trailing skirts over one arm, and together they\nglided away through the crowd to the strains of a Strauss waltz.\n\n\"I'm going to faint in a moment,\" she said quite calmly to Mr. Rankin.\n\"Please have me sent to the ladies' dressing-room.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" he replied quietly.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE FLEEING WOMAN\n\n\nMr. Grimm went straight to a quiet nook of the smoking-room and there,\nafter a moment, Mr. Campbell joined him. The bland benevolence of the\nchief's face was disturbed by the slightest questioning uplift of his\nbrows as he dropped into a seat opposite Mr. Grimm, and lighted a cigar.\nMr. Grimm raised his hand, and a servant who stood near, approached\nthem.\n\n\"An ice--here,\" Mr. Grimm directed tersely.\n\nThe servant bowed and disappeared, and Mr. Grimm hastily scribbled\nsomething on a sheet of paper and handed it to his chief.\n\n\"There is a reading, in the Morse code, of a message that seems to be\nunintelligible,\" Mr. Grimm explained. \"I have reason to believe it is\nin the Continental code. You know the Continental--I don't.\"\n\nMr. Campbell read this:\n\n\"St5ut man fed qaje neaf j5nsefvat5f,\" and then came the unknown,\ndash-dot-dash-dash. \"That,\" he explained, \"is Y in the Continental\ncode.\" It went on: \"d55f bfing 5vef when g g5es.\"\n\nThe chief read it off glibly:\n\n\"Stout man, red face, near conservatory door. Bring over when G goes.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" commented Mr. Grimm ambiguously.\n\nWith no word of explanation, he rose and went out, pausing at the door\nto take the ice which the servant was bringing in. The seat where he had\nleft Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez was vacant; so was the chair where Miss Thorne\nhad been. He glanced about inquiringly, and a servant who stood stolidly\nnear the conservatory door approached him.\n\n\"Pardon, sir, but the lady who was sitting here,\" and he indicated the\nchair where Miss Thorne had been sitting, \"fainted while dancing, and\nthe lady who was with you went along when she was removed to the ladies'\ndressing-room, sir.\"\n\nMr. Grimm's teeth closed with a little snap.\n\n\"Did you happen to notice any time this evening a stout gentleman, with\nred face, near the conservatory door?\" he asked.\n\nThe servant pondered a moment, then shook his head.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nMr. Grimm was just turning away, when there came the sharp, vibrant\ncra-a-sh! of a revolver, somewhere off to his left. The president! That\nwas his first thought. One glance across the room to where the chief\nexecutive stood, in conversation with two other gentlemen, reassured\nhim. The choleric blue eyes of the president had opened a little at the\nsound, then he calmly resumed the conversation. Mr. Grimm impulsively\nstarted toward the little group, but already a cordon was being drawn\nthere--a cordon of quiet-faced, keen-eyed men, unobstrusively forcing\ntheir way through the crowd. There was Johnson, and Hastings, and Blair,\nand half a dozen others.\n\nThe room had been struck dumb. The dancers stopped, with tense,\ninquiring looks, and the plaintive whine of the orchestra, far away,\nfaltered, then ceased. There was one brief instant of utter silence in\nwhich white-faced women clung to the arms of their escorts, and the\nbrilliant galaxy of colors halted. Then, after a moment, there came\nclearly through the stillness, the excited, guttural command of the\nGerman ambassador.\n\n\"Keep on blaying, you tam fools! Keep on blaying!\"\n\nThe orchestra started again tremulously. Mr. Grimm nodded a silent\napproval of the ambassador's command, then turned away toward his left,\nin the direction of the shot. After the first dismay, there was a\ngeneral movement of the crowd in that direction, a movement which was\nchecked by Mr. Campbell's appearance upon a chair, with a smile on his\nbland face.\n\n\"No harm done,\" he called. \"One of the officers present dropped his\nrevolver, and it was accidently discharged. No harm done.\"\n\nThere was a moment's excited chatter, deep-drawn breaths of relief, the\norchestra swung again into the interrupted rhythm, and the dancers moved\non. Mr. Grimm went straight to his chief, who had stepped down from the\nchair. Two other Secret Service men stood behind him, blocking the\ndoorway that opened into a narrow hall.\n\n\"This way,\" directed the chief tersely.\n\nMr. Grimm walked along beside him. They skirted the end of the ball-room\nuntil they came to another door opening into the hall. Chief Campbell\npushed it open, and entered. One of his men stood just inside.\n\n\"What was it, Gray?\" asked the chief.\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez, of the Mexican legation, was shot,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"Only wounded. He's in that room,\" and he indicated a door a little way\ndown the hall. \"Fairchild, two servants, and a physician are with him.\"\n\n\"Who shot him?\"\n\n\"Don't know. We found him lying in the hall here.\"\n\nStill followed by Mr. Grimm, the chief entered the room, and together\nthey bent over the wounded man. The bullet had entered the torso just\nbelow the ribs on the left side.\n\n\"It's a clean wound,\" the physician was explaining. \"The bullet passed\nthrough. There's no immediate danger.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez opened his eyes, and stared about him in bewilderment;\nthen alarm overspread his face, and he made spasmodic efforts to reach\nthe inside breast pocket of his coat. Mr. Grimm obligingly thrust his\nhand into the pocket and drew out its contents, the while Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez\nstruggled frantically.\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Mr. Grimm advised quietly. \"I'm only going to let you\nsee if it is here. Is it?\"\n\nHe held the papers, one by one, in front of the wounded man, and each\ntime a shake of the head was his answer. At the last Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez\nclosed his eyes again.\n\n\"What sort of paper was it?\" inquired Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"None of your business,\" came the curt answer.\n\n\"Who shot you?\"\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"A man?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez was silent.\n\n\"A woman?\"\n\nStill silence.\n\nWith some new idea Mr. Grimm turned away suddenly and started out into\nthe hall. He met a maid-servant at the door, coming in. Her face was\nblanched, and she stuttered through sheer excitement.\n\n\"A lady, sir--a lady--\" she began babblingly.\n\nMr. Grimm calmly closed the door, shutting in the wounded man, Chief\nCampbell and the others. Then he caught the maid sharply by the arm and\nshook some coherence into her disordered brain.\n\n\"A lady--she ran away, sir,\" the girl went on, in blank surprise.\n\n\"What lady?\" demanded Mr. Grimm coldly. \"Where did she run from? Why did\nshe run?\" The maid stared at him with mouth agape. \"Begin at the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"I was in that room, farther down the hall, sir,\" the maid explained.\n\"The door was open. I heard the shot, and it frightened me so--I don't\nknow--I was afraid to look out right away, sir. Then, an instant later,\na lady come running along the hall, sir--that way,\" and she indicated\nthe rear of the house. \"Then I came to the door and looked out to see\nwho it was, and what was the matter, sir. I was standing there when a\nman--a man came along after the lady, and banged the door in my face,\nsir. The door had a spring lock, and I was so--so frightened and excited\nI couldn't open it right away, sir, and--and when I did I came here to\nsee what was the matter.\" She drew a deep breath and stopped.\n\n\"That all?\" demanded Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"Yes, sir, except--except the lady had a pistol in her hand, sir--\"\n\nMr. Grimm regarded her in silence for a moment.\n\n\"Who was the lady?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I forget her name, sir. She was the lady who--who fainted in the\nball-room, sir, just a few minutes ago.\"\n\nWhatever emotion may have been aroused within Mr. Grimm it certainly\nfound no expression in his face. When he spoke again his voice was quite\ncalm.\n\n\"Miss Thorne, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, that's the name--Miss Thorne. I was in the ladies'\ndressing-room when she was brought in, sir, and I remember some one\ncalled her name.\"\n\nMr. Grimm took the girl, still a-quiver with excitement, and led her\nalong the hall to where Gray stood.\n\n\"Take this girl in charge, Gray,\" he directed. \"Lock her up, if\nnecessary. Don't permit her to say one word to anybody--_anybody_ you\nunderstand, except the chief.\"\n\nMr. Grimm left them there. He passed along the hall, glancing in each\nroom as he went, until he came to a short flight of stairs leading\ntoward the kitchen. He went on down silently. The lights were burning,\nbut the place was still, deserted. All the servants who belonged there\nwere evidently, for the moment, transferred to other posts. He passed on\nthrough the kitchen and out the back door into the street.\n\nA little distance away, leaning against a lamp-post, a man was\nstanding. He might have been waiting for a car. Mr. Grimm approached\nhim.\n\n\"Beg pardon,\" he said, \"did you see a woman come out of the back door,\nthere?\"\n\n\"Yes, just a moment or so ago,\" replied the stranger. \"She got into an\nautomobile at the corner. I imagine this is hers,\" and he extended a\nhandkerchief, a dainty, perfumed trifle of lace. \"I picked it up\nimmediately after she passed.\"\n\nMr. Grimm took the handkerchief and examined it under the light. For a\ntime he was thoughtful, with lowered eyes, which, finally raised, met\nthose of the stranger with a scrutinizing stare.\n\n\"Why,\" asked Mr. Grimm slowly and distinctly, \"why did you slam the door\nin the girl's face?\"\n\n\"Why did I--what?\" came the answering question.\n\n\"Why did you slam the door in the girl's face?\" Mr. Grimm repeated\nslowly.\n\nThe stranger stared in utter amazement--an amazement so frank, so\nunacted, so genuine, that Mr. Grimm was satisfied.\n\n\"Did you see a man come out the door?\" Mr. Grimm pursued.\n\n\"No. Say, young fellow, I guess you've had a little too much to drink,\nhaven't you?\"\n\nBut by that time Mr. Grimm was turning the corner.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nA VISIT TO THE COUNT\n\n\nThe bland serenity of Mr. Campbell's face was disturbed by thin, spidery\nlines of perplexity, and the guileless blue eyes were vacant as he\nstared at the top of his desk. Mr. Grimm was talking.\n\n\"From the moment Miss Thorne turned the corner I lost all trace of her,\"\nhe said. \"Either she had an automobile in waiting, or else she was lucky\nenough to find one immediately she came out. She did not return to the\nembassy ball last night--that much is certain.\" He paused reflectively.\n\"She is a guest of Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Inez Rodriguez at the Venezuelan legation,\"\nhe added.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" his chief nodded.\n\n\"I didn't attempt to see her there last night for two reasons,\" Mr.\nGrimm continued. \"First, she can have no possible knowledge of the fact\nthat she is suspected, unless perhaps the man who slammed the door--\"\nHe paused. \"Anyway, she will not attempt to leave Washington; I am\nconfident of that. Again, it didn't seem wise to me to employ the\nordinary crude police methods in the case--that is, go to the Venezuelan\nlegation and kick up a row.\"\n\nFor a long time Campbell was silent; the perplexed lines still furrowed\nhis benevolent forehead.\n\n\"The president is very anxious that we get to facts in this reported\nLatin alliance as soon as possible,\" he said at last, irrelevantly. \"He\nmentioned the matter last night, and he has been keeping in constant\ncommunication with Gault, in Lisbon, who, however, has not been able to\nadd materially to the original despatch. Under all the circumstances\ndon't you think it would be best for me to relieve you of the\ninvestigation of this shooting affair so that you can concentrate on\nthis greater and more important thing?\"\n\n\"Will Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez die?\" asked Mr. Grimm in turn.\n\n\"His condition is serious, although the wound is not necessarily fatal,\"\nwas the reply.\n\nMr. Grimm arose, stretched his long legs and stood for a little while\ngazing out the window. Finally he turned to his chief:\n\n\"What do we know, here in the bureau, about Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Thus far the reports on her are of the usual perfunctory nature,\" Mr.\nCampbell explained. He drew a card from a pigeonhole of his desk and\nglanced at it. \"She arrived in Washington two weeks and two days ago\nfrom New York, off the _Lusitania_, from Liverpool. She brought some\nsort of an introduction to Count di Rosini, the Italian ambassador, and\nhe obtained for her a special invitation to the state ball, which was\nheld that night. Until four days ago she was a guest at the Italian\nembassy, but now, as you know, is a guest at the Venezuelan legation.\nSince her arrival here she has been prominently pushed forward into\nsociety; she has gone everywhere, and been received everywhere in the\ndiplomatic set. We have no knowledge of her beyond this.\"\n\nThere was a question in Mr. Grimm's listless eyes as they met those of\nhis chief. The same line of thought was running in both their minds,\nborn, perhaps, of the association of ideas--Italy as one of three great\nnations known to be in the Latin compact; Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi, of\nItaly, the secret envoy of three countries; the sudden appearance of\nMiss Thorne at the Italian embassy. And in the mind of the younger man\nthere was more than this--a definite knowledge of a message cunningly\ntransmitted to Mr. Rankin, of the German embassy, by Miss Thorne there\nin the ball-room.\n\n\"Can you imagine--\" he asked slowly, \"can you imagine a person who would\nbe of more value to the Latin governments in Washington right at this\nstage of the negotiations than a brilliant woman agent?\"\n\n\"I most certainly can not,\" was the chief's unhesitating response.\n\n\"In that case I _don't_ think it would be wise to transfer the\ninvestigation of the shooting affair to another man,\" said Mr. Grimm\nemphatically, reverting to his chief's question. \"I think, on the\ncontrary, we should find out more about Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Campbell agreed.\n\n\"Ask all the great capitals about her--Madrid, Paris and Rome,\nparticularly; then, perhaps, London and Berlin and St. Petersburg.\"\n\nMr. Campbell thoughtfully scribbled the names of the cities on a slip of\npaper.\n\n\"Do you intend to arrest Miss Thorne for the shooting?\" he queried.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Mr. Grimm frankly. \"I don't know,\" he repeated\nmusingly. \"If I _do_ arrest her immediately I may cut off a clue which\nwill lead to the other affair. I don't know,\" he concluded.\n\n\"Use your own judgment, and bear in mind that a man--_a man_ slammed\nthe door in the maid's face.\"\n\n\"I shall not forget him,\" Mr. Grimm answered. \"Now I'm going over to\ntalk to Count di Rosini for a while.\"\n\nThe young man went out, thoughtfully tugging at his gloves. The Italian\nambassador received him with an inquiring uplift of his dark brows.\n\n\"I came to make some inquiries in regard to Miss Thorne--Miss Isabel\nThorne,\" Mr. Grimm informed him frankly.\n\nThe count was surprised, but it didn't appear in his face.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" the young man pursued, \"you are sponsor for her in\nWashington?\"\n\nThe count, evasively diplomatic, born and bred in a school of caution,\nconsidered the question from every standpoint.\n\n\"It may be that I am so regarded,\" he admitted at last.\n\n\"May I inquire if the sponsorship is official, personal, social, or all\nthree?\" Mr. Grimm continued.\n\nThere was silence for a long time.\n\n\"I don't see the trend of your questioning,\" said the ambassador\nfinally. \"Miss Thorne is worthy of my protection in every way.\"\n\n\"Let's suppose a case,\" suggested Mr. Grimm blandly. \"Suppose Miss\nThorne had--had, let us say, shot a man, and he was about to die, would\nyou feel justified in withdrawing that--that protection, as you call\nit?\"\n\n\"Such a thing is preposterous!\" exclaimed the ambassador. \"The utter\nabsurdity of such a charge would impel me to offer her every\nassistance.\"\n\nMr. Grimm nodded.\n\n\"And if it were proved to your satisfaction that she _did_ shoot him?\"\nhe went on evenly.\n\nThe count's lips were drawn together in a straight line.\n\n\"Whom, may I ask,\" he inquired frigidly, \"are we supposing that Miss\nThorne shot?\"\n\n\"No one, particularly,\" Mr. Grimm assured him easily. \"Just suppose\nthat she _had_ shot anybody--me, say, or Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez?\"\n\n\"I can't answer a question so ridiculous as that.\"\n\n\"And suppose we go a little further,\" Mr. Grimm insisted pleasantly,\n\"and assume that you _knew_ she _had_ shot some one, say Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez,\nand you _could_ protect her from the consequences, _would_ you?\"\n\n\"I decline to suppose anything so utterly absurd,\" was the rejoinder.\n\nMr. Grimm sat with his elbows on his knees, idly twisting a seal ring on\nhis little finger. The searching eyes of the ambassador found his face\nblankly inscrutable.\n\n\"Diplomatic representatives in Washington have certain obligations to\nthis government,\" the young man reminded him. \"We--that is, the\ngovernment of the United States--undertake to guarantee the personal\nsafety of every accredited representative; in return for that\nprotection we must insist upon the name and identity of a dangerous\nperson who may be known to any foreign representative. Understand,\nplease, I'm not asserting that Miss Thorne is a dangerous person. You\nare sponsor for her here. Is she, in every way, worthy of your\nprotection?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the ambassador flatly.\n\n\"I can take it, then, that the introduction she brought to you is from a\nperson whose position is high enough to insure Miss Thorne's position?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\nAnd Mr. Grimm went away.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nREVELATIONS\n\n\nSome vague, indefinable shadow darkened Miss Thorne's clear, blue-gray\neyes, in sharp contrast to the glow of radiant health in her cheeks, as\nshe stepped from an automobile in front of the Venezuelan legation, and\nran lightly up the steps. A liveried servant opened the door.\n\n\"A gentleman is waiting for you, Madam,\" he announced. \"His card is here\non the--\"\n\n\"I was expecting him,\" she interrupted.\n\n\"Which room, please?\"\n\n\"The blue room, Madam.\"\n\nMiss Thorne passed along the hallway which led to a suite of small\ndrawing-rooms opening on a garden in the rear, pushed aside the\nporti\u00c3\u00a8res, and entered.\n\n\"I'm sorry I've kept you--\" she began, and then, in a tone of surprise:\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nA gentleman rose and bowed gravely.\n\n\"I am Mr. Grimm of the Secret Service,\" he informed her with frank\ncourtesy. \"I am afraid you were expecting some one else; I handed my\ncard to the footman.\"\n\nFor an instant the blue-gray eyes opened wide in astonishment, and then\nsome quick, subtle change swept over Miss Thorne's face. She smiled\ngraciously and motioned him to a seat.\n\n\"This is quite a different meeting from the one Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez had\nplanned, isn't it?\" she asked.\n\nThere was a taunting curve on her scarlet lips; the shadow passed from\nher eyes; her slim, white hands lay idle in her lap. Mr. Grimm regarded\nher reflectively. There was a determination of steel back of this\ncharming exterior; there was an indomitable will, a keen brain, and all\nof a woman's intuition to reckon with. She was silent, with a\nquestioning upward slant of her arched brows.\n\n\"I am not mistaken in assuming that you are a secret agent of the\nItalian government, am I?\" he queried finally.\n\n\"No,\" she responded readily.\n\n\"In that event I may speak with perfect frankness?\" he went on. \"It\nwould be as useless as it would be absurd to approach the matter in any\nother manner?\" It was a question.\n\nMiss Thorne was still smiling, but again the vague, indefinable shadow,\nmomentarily lifted, darkened her eyes.\n\n\"You may be frank, of course,\" she said pleasantly. \"Please go on.\"\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez was shot at the German Embassy Ball last night,\" Mr.\nGrimm told her.\n\nMiss Thorne nodded, as if in wonder.\n\n\"Did you, or did you not, shoot him?\"\n\nIt was quite casual. She received the question without change of\ncountenance, but involuntarily she caught her breath. It might have\nbeen a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Why do you come to me with such a query?\" she asked in turn.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Mr. Grimm steadily. \"Did you, or did you\nnot, shoot him?\"\n\n\"No, of course I didn't shoot him,\" was the reply. If there was any\nemotion in the tone it was merely impatience. \"Why do you come to me?\"\nshe repeated.\n\n\"Why do I come to you?\" Mr. Grimm echoed the question, while his\nlistless eyes rested on her face. \"I will be absolutely frank, as I feel\nsure you would be under the same circumstances.\" He paused a moment; she\nnodded. \"Well, immediately after the shooting you ran along the hallway\nwith a revolver in your hand; you ran down the steps into the kitchen,\nand out through the back door, where you entered an automobile. That is\nnot conjecture; it is susceptible of proof by eye witnesses.\"\n\nMiss Thorne rose suddenly with a queer, helpless little gesture of her\narms, and walked to the window. She stood there for a long time with her\nhands clasped behind her back.\n\n\"That brings us to another question,\" Mr. Grimm continued mercilessly.\n\"If you did not shoot Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez, do you know who did?\"\n\nThere was another long pause.\n\n\"I want to believe you, Miss Thorne,\" he supplemented.\n\nShe turned quickly with something of defiance in her attitude.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she said slowly. \"It were useless to deny it.\"\n\n\"Who was it?\"\n\n\"I won't tell you.\"\n\nMr. Grimm leaned forward in his chair, and spoke earnestly.\n\n\"Understand, please, that by that answer you assume equal guilt with the\nperson who actually did the shooting,\" he explained. \"If you adhere to\nit you compel me to regard you as an accomplice.\" His questioning took a\ndifferent line.\n\n\"Will you explain how the revolver came into your possession?\"\n\n\"Oh, I--I picked it up in the hallway there,\" she replied vaguely.\n\n\"I want to believe you, Miss Thorne,\" Mr. Grimm said again.\n\n\"You may. I picked it up in the hallway,\" she repeated. \"I saw it lying\nthere and picked it up.\"\n\n\"Why that, instead of giving an alarm?\"\n\n\"No alarm was necessary. The shot itself was an alarm.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" Mr. Grimm persisted coldly, \"did you run along the hallway\nand escape by way of the kitchen? If you did not do the shooting, why\nthe necessity of escape, carrying the revolver?\"\n\nThere was that in the blue-gray eyes which brought Mr. Grimm to his\nfeet. His hands gripped each other cruelly; his tone was calm as always.\n\n\"Why did you take the revolver?\" he asked.\n\nMiss Thorne's head drooped forward a little, and she was silent.\n\n\"There are only two possibilities, of course,\" he went on. \"First, that\nyou, in spite of your denial, did the shooting.\"\n\n\"I did not!\" The words fairly burst from her tightly closed lips.\n\n\"Or that you knew the revolver, and took it to save the person, man or\nwoman, who fired the shot. I will assume, for the moment, that this is\ncorrect. Where is the revolver?\"\n\nFrom the adjoining room there came a slight noise, a faint breath of\nsound; or it might have been only an echo of silence. Their eyes were\nfixed each upon the others unwaveringly, with not a flicker to indicate\nthat either had heard. After a moment Miss Thorne returned to her chair\nand sat down.\n\n\"It's rather a singular situation, isn't it, Mr. Grimm?\" she inquired\nirrelevantly. \"You, Mr. Grimm of the Secret Service of the United\nStates; I, Isabel Thorne, a secret agent of Italy together here, one\naccusing the other of a crime, and perhaps with good reason.\"\n\n\"Where is the revolver?\" Mr. Grimm insisted.\n\n\"If you were any one else _but_ you! I could not afford to be frank with\nyou and--\"\n\n\"If you had been any one else but _you_ I should have placed you under\narrest when I entered the room.\"\n\nShe smiled, and inclined her head.\n\n\"I understand,\" she said pleasantly. \"For the reason that you are Mr.\nGrimm of the Secret Service I shall tell you the truth. I _did_ take the\nrevolver because I knew who had fired the shot. Believe me when I tell\nyou that that person did not act with my knowledge or consent. You do\nbelieve that? You do?\" She was pleading, eager to convince him.\n\nAfter a while Mr. Grimm nodded.\n\n\"The revolver is beyond your reach and shall remain so,\" she resumed.\n\"According to your laws I suppose I am an accomplice. That is my\nmisfortune. It will in no way alter my determination to keep silent. If\nI am arrested I can't help it.\" She studied his face with hopeful eyes.\n\"Am I to be arrested?\"\n\n\"Where is the paper that was taken from Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez immediately after\nhe was shot?\" Mr. Grimm queried.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she replied frankly.\n\n\"As I understand it, then, the motive for the shooting was to obtain\npossession of that paper? For your government?\"\n\n\"The individual who shot Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez _did_ obtain the paper, yes. And\nnow, please, am I to be arrested?\"\n\n\"And just what was the purpose, may I inquire, of the message you\ntelegraphed with your fan in the ball-room?\"\n\n\"You read that?\" exclaimed Miss Thorne in mock astonishment. \"You read\nthat?\"\n\n\"And the man who read that message? Perhaps he shot the se\u00c3\u00b1or?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she taunted.\n\nFor a long time Mr. Grimm stood staring at her, staring, staring. She,\ntoo, rose, and faced him quietly.\n\n\"Am I to be arrested?\" she asked again.\n\n\"Why do you make me do it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"That is my affair.\"\n\nMr. Grimm laid a hand upon her arm, a hand that had never known\nnervousness. A moment longer he stared, and then:\n\n\"Madam, you are my prisoner for the attempted murder of Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez!\"\n\nThe rings on the porti\u00c3\u00a8res behind him clicked sharply, and the draperies\nparted. Mr. Grimm stood motionless, with his hand on Miss Thorne's arm.\n\n\"You were inquiring a moment ago for a revolver,\" came in a man's voice.\n\"Here it is!\"\n\nMr. Grimm found himself inspecting the weapon from the barrel end. After\na moment his glance shifted to the blazing eyes of the man who held\nit--a young man, rather slight, with clean-cut, aristocratic features,\nand of the pronounced Italian type.\n\n[Illustration: He found himself inspecting the weapon from the barrel\nend.]\n\n\"My God!\" The words came from Miss Thorne's lips almost in a scream.\n\"Don't--!\"\n\n\"I did make some inquiries about a revolver, yes,\" Mr. Grimm interrupted\nquietly. \"Is this the one?\"\n\nHe raised his hand quite casually, and his fingers closed like steel\naround the weapon. Behind his back Miss Thorne made some quick emphatic\ngesture, and the new-comer released the revolver.\n\n\"I shall ask you, please, to free Miss Thorne,\" he requested\ncourteously. \"I shot Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez. I, too, am a secret agent of the\nItalian government, willing and able to defend myself. Miss Thorne has\ntold you the truth; she had nothing whatever to do with it. She took the\nweapon and escaped because it was mine. Here is the paper that was taken\nfrom Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez,\" and he offered a sealed envelope. \"I have read it;\nit is not what I expected. You may return it to Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez with my\ncompliments.\"\n\nAfter a moment Mr. Grimm's hand fell away from Miss Thorne's arm, and\nhe regarded the new-comer with an interest in which admiration, even,\nplayed a part.\n\n\"Your name?\" he asked finally.\n\n\"Pietro Petrozinni,\" was the ready reply. \"As I say, I accept all\nresponsibility.\"\n\nA few minutes later Mr. Grimm and his prisoner passed out of the\nlegation side by side, and strolled down the street together, in\namicable conversation. Half an hour later Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez identified\nPietro Petrozinni as the man who shot him; and the maid servant\nexpressed a belief that he was the man who slammed the door in her face.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE SIGNAL\n\n\n\"And the original question remains unanswered,\" remarked Mr. Campbell.\n\n\"The original question?\" repeated Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"_Where_ is Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi, the secret envoy?\" his chief\nreminded him.\n\n\"I wonder!\" mused the young man.\n\n\"If the Latin compact is signed in the United States--?\"\n\n\"The Latin compact will _not_ be signed in the United States,\" Mr. Grimm\ninterrupted. And then, after a moment: \"Have we received any further\nreports on Miss Thorne? I mean reports from our foreign agents?\"\n\nThe chief shook his head.\n\n\"Inevitably, by some act or word, she will lead us to the prince,\"\ndeclared Mr. Grimm, \"and the moment he is known to us everything becomes\nplain sailing. We know she _is_ a secret agent--I expected a denial, but\nshe was quite frank about it. And I had no intention whatever of placing\nher under arrest. I knew some one was in the adjoining room because of a\nslight noise in there, and I knew she knew it. She raised her voice a\nlittle, obviously for the benefit of whoever was there. From that point\neverything I said and did was to compel that person, whoever it was, to\nshow himself.\"\n\nHis chief nodded, understandingly. Mr. Grimm was silent for a little,\nthen went on:\n\n\"The last possibility in my mind at that moment,\" he confessed, \"was\nthat the person in there was the man who shot Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez. Frankly I\nhad half an idea that--that it might be the prince in person.\" Suddenly\nhis mood changed: \"And now our lady of mystery may come and go as she\nlikes because I know, even if a dozen of our men have ransacked\nWashington in vain for the prince, she will inevitably lead us to him.\nAnd that reminds me: I should like to borrow Blair, and Hastings, and\nJohnson. Please plant them so they may keep constant watch on Miss\nThorne. Let them report to you, and, wherever I am, I will reach you\nover the 'phone.\"\n\n\"By the way, what was in that sealed packet that was taken from Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nAlvarez?\" Campbell inquired curiously.\n\n\"It had something to do with some railroad franchises,\" responded Mr.\nGrimm as he rose. \"I sealed it again and returned it to the se\u00c3\u00b1or.\nEvidently it was not what Signor Petrozinni expected to find--in fact,\nhe admitted it wasn't what he was looking for.\"\n\nFor a little while the two men gazed thoughtfully, each into the eyes of\nthe other, then Mr. Grimm entered his private office where he sat for an\nhour with his immaculate boots on his desk, thinking. A world-war--he\nhad been thrust forward by his government to prevent it--subtle\nblue-gray eyes--his Highness, Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi--a haunting\nsmile and scarlet lips.\n\nAt about the moment he rose to go out, Miss Thorne, closely veiled, left\nthe Venezuelan legation and walked rapidly down the street to a corner,\nwhere, without a word, she entered a waiting automobile. The wheels spun\nand the car leaped forward. For a mile or more it wound aimlessly in and\nout, occasionally bisecting its own path; finally Miss Thorne leaned\nforward and touched the chauffeur on the arm.\n\n\"Now!\" she said.\n\nThe car straightened out into a street of stately residences and\nscuttled along until the placid bosom of the Potomac came into view;\nbeside that for a few minutes, then over the bridge to the Virginia\nside, in the dilapidated little city of Alexandria. The car did not\nslacken its speed, but wound in and out through dingy streets, past\ntumble-down negro huts, for half an hour before it came to a standstill\nin front of an old brick mansion.\n\n\"This is number ninety-seven,\" the chauffeur announced.\n\nMiss Thorne entered the house with a key and was gone for ten minutes,\nperhaps. She was readjusting her veil when she came out and stepped into\nthe car silently. Again it moved forward, on to the end of the dingy\nstreet, and finally into the open country. Three, four, five miles,\nperhaps, out the old Baltimore Road, and again the car stopped, this\ntime in front of an ancient colonial farm-house.\n\nOutwardly the place seemed to be deserted. The blinds, battered and\nstripped of paint by wind and rain, were all closed, and one corner of\nthe small veranda had crumbled away from age and neglect. A narrow path,\nstrewn with pine needles, led tortuously up to the door. In the rear of\nthe house, rising from an old barn, a thin pole with a cup-like\nattachment at the apex, thrust its point into the open above the dense,\nodorous pines. It appeared to be a wireless mast. Miss Thorne passed\naround the house, and entered the barn.\n\nA man came forward and kissed her--a thin, little man of indeterminate\nage--drying his hands on a piece of cotton waste. His face was pale with\nthe pallor of one who knows little outdoor life, his eyes deep-set and\na-glitter with some feverish inward fire, and the thin lips were pressed\ntogether in a sharp line. Behind him was a long bench on which were\nscattered tools of various sorts, fantastically shaped chemical\napparatus, two or three electric batteries of odd sizes, and ranged\nalong one end of it, in a row, were a score or more metal spheroids, a\nshade larger than a one-pound shell. From somewhere in the rear came the\nclatter of a small gasoline engine, and still farther away was an\nelectric dynamo.\n\n\"Is the test arranged, Rosa?\" the little man queried eagerly in Italian.\n\n\"The date is not fixed yet,\" she replied in the same language. \"It will\nbe, I hope, within the next two weeks. And then--\"\n\n\"Fame and fortune for both of us,\" he interrupted with quick enthusiasm.\n\"Ah, Rosa, I have worked and waited so long for this, and now it will\ncome, and with it the dominion of the world again by our country. How\nwill I know when the date is fixed? It would not be well to write me\nhere.\"\n\nMy lady of mystery stroked the slender, nervous hand caressingly, and a\ngreat affection shone in the blue-gray eyes.\n\n\"At eight o'clock on the night of the test,\" she explained, still\nspeaking Italian, \"a single light will appear at the apex of the capitol\ndome in Washington. That is the signal agreed upon; it can be seen by\nall in the city, and is visible here from the window of your bedroom.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he exclaimed. The feverish glitter in his eyes deepened.\n\n\"If there is a fog, of course you will not attempt the test,\" she went\non.\n\n\"No, not in a fog,\" he put in quickly. \"It must be clear.\"\n\n\"And if it is clear you can see the light in the dome without\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"And all your plans are working out well?\"\n\n\"Yes. And yours?\"\n\n\"I don't think there is any question but that both England and the\nUnited States will buy. Do you know what it means? Do you know what it\nmeans?\" He was silent a moment, his hands working nervously. Then, with\nan effort: \"And his Highness?\"\n\n\"His Highness is safe.\" The subtle eyes grew misty, thoughtful for a\nmoment, then cleared again. \"He is safe,\" she repeated.\n\n\"Mexico and Venezuela were--?\" he began.\n\n\"We don't know, yet, what they will do. The Venezuelan answer is locked\nin the safe at the legation; I will know what it is within forty-eight\nhours.\" She was silent a little. \"Our difficulty now, our greatest\ndifficulty, is the hostility of the French ambassador to the compact.\nHis government has not yet notified him of the presence of Prince\nd'Abruzzi; he does not believe in the feasibility of the plan, and we\nhave to--to proceed to extremes to prevent him working against us.\"\n\n\"But they _must_ see the incalculable advantages to follow upon such a\ncompact, with the vast power that will be given to them over the whole\nearth by this.\" He indicated the long, littered work-table. \"They _must_\nsee it.\"\n\n\"They will see it, Luigi,\" said Miss Thorne gently. \"And now, how are\nyou? Are you well? Are you comfortable? It's such a dreary old place\nhere.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he replied, and he met the solicitous blue-gray eyes for\nan instant. \"Yes, I am quite comfortable,\" he added. \"I have no time to\nbe otherwise with all the work I must do. It will mean so much!\"\n\nThey were both silent for a time. Finally Miss Thorne walked over to the\nlong table and curiously lifted one of the spheroids. It was a sinister\nlooking thing, nickeled, glittering. At one end of it was a delicate,\nvibratory apparatus, not unlike the transmitter of a telephone, and the\nother end was threaded, as if the spheroid was made as an attachment to\nsome other device.\n\n\"With that we control the world!\" exclaimed the man triumphantly. \"And\nit's mine, Rosa, mine!\"\n\n\"It's wonderful!\" she mused softly. \"Wonderful! And now I must go. I may\nnot see you again until after the test, because I shall be watched and\nfollowed wherever I go. If I get an opportunity I shall reach you by\ntelephone, but not even that unless it is necessary. There is always\ndanger, always danger!\" she repeated thoughtfully. She was thinking of\nMr. Grimm.\n\n\"I understand,\" said the man simply.\n\n\"And look out for the signal--the light in the apex of the capitol\ndome,\" she went on. \"I understand the night must be perfectly clear; and\n_you_ understand that the test is to be made promptly at three o'clock\nby your chronometer?\"\n\n\"At three o'clock,\" he repeated.\n\nFor a moment they stood with their arms around each other, then tenderly\nhis visitor kissed him, and went out. He remained looking after her\nvacantly until the chug-chug of her automobile, as it moved off down the\nroad, was lost in the distance, then turned again to the long\nwork-table.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMISS THORNE AND NOT MISS THORNE\n\n\nFrom a pleasant, wide-open bay-window of her apartments on the second\nfloor, Miss Thorne looked out upon the avenue with inscrutable eyes.\nBehind the closely drawn shutters of another bay-window, farther down\nthe avenue, on the corner, she knew a man named Hastings was hiding; she\nknew that for an hour or more he had been watching her as she wrote. In\nthe other direction, in a house near the corner, another man named Blair\nwas similarly ensconced, and he, too, had been watching as she wrote.\nThere should be a third man, Johnson. Miss Thorne curiously studied the\nface of each passer-by, seeking therein something to remember.\n\nShe sat at the little mahogany desk and a note with the ink yet wet\nupon it lay face up before her. It was addressed to Signor Pietro\nPetrozinni in the district prison, and read:\n\n\"My Dear Friend:\n\n\"I have been waiting to write you with the hope that I could report\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez out of danger, but his condition, I regret to say, remains\nunchanged. Shall I send an attorney to you? Would you like a book of any\nkind? Or some delicacy sent in from a restaurant? Can I be of any\nservice to you in any way? If I can please drop me a line.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\n\"Isabel Thorne.\"\n\nAt last she rose and standing in the window read the note over, folded\nit, placed it in an envelope and sealed it. A maid came in answer to her\nring, and there at the window, under the watchful eyes of Blair and\nHastings--and, perhaps, Johnson--she handed the note to the maid with\ninstructions to mail it immediately. Two minutes later she saw the maid\ngo out along the avenue to a post-box on the corner.\n\nThen she drew back into the shadow of the room, slipped on a\ndark-colored wrap, and, standing away from the window, safe beyond the\nreach of prying eyes, waited patiently for the postman. He appeared\nabout five o'clock and simultaneously another man turned the corner near\nthe post-box and spoke to him. Then, together, they disappeared from\nview around the corner.\n\n\"So that's Johnson, is it?\" mused Miss Thorne, and she smiled a little.\n\"Mr. Grimm certainly pays me the compliment of having me carefully\nwatched.\"\n\nA few minutes later she dropped into the seat at the desk again. The\ndark wrap had been thrown aside and Hastings and Blair from their\nhiding-places could see her distinctly. After a while they saw her rise\nquickly, as an automobile turned into the avenue, and lean toward the\nwindow eagerly looking out. The car came to a standstill in front of the\nlegation, and Mr. Cadwallader, an under-secretary of the British\nembassy, who was alone in the car, raised his cap. She nodded and\nsmiled, then disappeared in the shadows of the room again.\n\nMr. Cadwallader went to the door, spoke to the servant there, then\nreturned and busied himself about the car. Hastings and Blair watched\nintently both the door and the window for a long time; finally a closely\nveiled and muffled figure appeared at the bay-window, and waved a gloved\nhand at Mr. Cadwallader, who again lifted his cap. A minute later the\nveiled woman came out of the front door, shook hands with Mr.\nCadwallader, and got in the car. He also climbed in, and the car moved\nslowly away.\n\nSimultaneously the front door of the house on the corner, where Hastings\nhad been hiding, and the front door of the house near the corner, where\nBlair had been hiding, opened and two heads peered out. As the car\napproached Hastings' hiding-place he withdrew into the hallway; but\nBlair came out and hurried past the legation in the direction of the\nrapidly disappearing motor. Hastings joined him; they spoke together,\nthen turned the corner.\n\nIt was about ten o'clock that night when Hastings reported to Mr.\nCampbell at his home.\n\n\"We followed the car in a rented automobile from the time it turned the\ncorner, out through Alexandria, and along the old Baltimore Road into\nthe city of Baltimore,\" he explained. \"It was dark by the time we\nreached Alexandria, but we stuck to the car ahead, running without\nlights until we came in sight of Druid Hill Park, and then we had to\nshow lights or be held up. We covered those forty miles going in less\nthan two hours.\n\n\"After the car passed Druid Hill it slowed up a little, and ran off the\nturnpike into North Avenue, then into North Charles Street, and slowly\nalong that as if they were looking for a number. At last it stopped and\nMiss Thorne got out and entered a house. She was gone for more than half\nan hour, leaving Mr. Cadwallader with the car. While she was gone I made\nsome inquiries and learned that the house was occupied by a Mr. Thomas\nQ. Griswold. I don't know anything else about him; Blair may have\nlearned something.\n\n\"Now comes the curious part of it,\" and Hastings looked a little\nsheepish. \"When Miss Thorne came out of the house she was not Miss\nThorne at all--_she was Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Inez Rodriguez_, daughter of the\nVenezuelan minister. She wore the same clothing Miss Thorne had worn\ngoing, but her veil was lifted. Veiled and all muffled up one would have\ntaken oath it was the same woman. She and Cadwallader are back in\nWashington now, or are coming. That's all, except Blair is still in\nBaltimore, awaiting orders. I caught the train from the Charles Street\nstation and came back. Johnson, you know--\"\n\n\"Yes, I've seen Johnson,\" interrupted Campbell. \"Are you absolutely\npositive that the woman you saw get into the automobile with Mr.\nCadwallader was Miss Thorne?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" replied Hastings without hesitation. \"I saw her in her\nown room with her wraps on, then saw her come down and get into the\ncar.\"\n\n\"That's all,\" said the chief. \"Good night.\" For an hour or more he sat\nin a great, comfortable chair in the smoking-room of his own home, the\nguileless blue eyes vacant, staring, and spidery lines in the benevolent\nforehead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the morning of the second day following, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez, the\nminister from Venezuela, reported to the Secret Service Bureau the\ndisappearance of fifty thousand dollars in gold from a safe in his\nprivate office at the legation.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nFIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS\n\n\nMr. Campbell was talking.\n\n\"For several months past,\" he said, \"the International Investment\nCompany, through its representative, Mr. Cressy, has been secretly\nnegotiating with Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez for certain asphalt properties in\nVenezuela. Three days ago these negotiations were successfully\nconcluded, and yesterday afternoon Mr. Cressy, in secret, paid to Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nRodriguez, fifty thousand dollars in American gold, the first of four\npayments of similar sums. This gold was to have been shipped to\nPhiladelphia by express to-day to catch a steamer for Venezuela.\" Mr.\nGrimm nodded.\n\n\"The fact that this gold was in Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez's possession could not\nhave been known to more than half a dozen persons, as the negotiations\nthroughout have been in strict secrecy,\" and Mr. Campbell smiled\nbenignly. \"So much! Now, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez has just telephoned asking that\nI send a man to the legation at once. The gold was kept there over\nnight; or perhaps I should say that the se\u00c3\u00b1or intended to keep it there\nover night.\" Mr. Campbell stared at Mr. Grimm for a moment, then: \"Miss\nThorne, you know, is a guest at the legation, that is why I am referring\nthe matter to you.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mr. Grimm.\n\nAnd ten minutes later Mr. Grimm presented himself to Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez.\nThe minister from Venezuela, bubbling with excitement, was pacing forth\nand back across his office, ruffling his gray-black hair with nervous,\ntwining fingers. Mr. Grimm sat down.\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" he inquired placidly, \"fifty thousand dollars in gold would\nweigh nearly two hundred pounds, wouldn't it?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez stared at him blankly.\n\n\"_Si, Se\u00c3\u00b1or_,\" he agreed absently. And then, in English: \"Yes, I should\nimagine so.\"\n\n\"Well, was all of it stolen, or only a part of it?\" Mr. Grimm went on.\n\nThe minister gazed into the listless eyes for a time, then, apparently\nbewildered, walked forth and back across the room again. Finally he sat\ndown.\n\n\"All of it,\" he admitted. \"I can't understand it. No one, not a soul in\nthis house, except myself, knew it was here.\"\n\n\"In addition to this weight of, say two hundred pounds, fifty thousand\ndollars would make considerable bulk,\" mused Mr. Grimm. \"Very well!\nTherefore it would appear that the person, or persons, who got it must\nhave gone away from here heavily laden?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez nodded.\n\n\"And now, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" Mr. Grimm continued, \"if you will kindly state the\ncircumstances immediately preceding and following the theft?\"\n\nA slight frown which had been growing upon the smooth brow of the\ndiplomatist was instantly dissipated.\n\n\"The money--fifty thousand dollars in gold coin--was paid to me\nyesterday afternoon about four o'clock,\" he began slowly, in\nexplanation.\n\n\"By Mr. Cressy of the International Investment Company,\" supplemented\nMr. Grimm. \"Yes. Go on.\"\n\nThe diplomatist favored the young man with one sharp, inquiring glance,\nand continued:\n\n\"The gentleman who paid the money remained here from four until nine\no'clock while I, personally, counted it. As I counted it I placed it in\ncanvas bags and when he had gone I took these bags from this room into\nthat,\" he indicated a closed door to his right, \"and personally stowed\nthem away in the safe. I closed and locked the door of the safe myself;\nI _know_ that it _was_ locked. And that's all, except this morning the\nmoney was gone--every dollar of it.\"\n\n\"Safe blown?\" inquired Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or!\" exclaimed the diplomatist with sudden violence. \"No, the\nsafe was not blown! It was _closed and locked_, exactly as I had left\nit!\"\n\nMr. Grimm was idly twisting the seal ring on his little finger.\n\n\"Just as I left it!\" Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez repeated excitedly. \"Last night\nafter I locked the safe door I tried it to make certain that it _was_\nlocked. I happened to notice then that the pointer on the dial had\nstopped precisely at number forty-five. This morning, when I unlocked\nthe safe--and, of course, I didn't know then that the money had been\ntaken--the pointer was still at number forty-five.\"\n\nHe paused with one hand in the air; Mr. Grimm continued to twist the\nseal ring.\n\n\"It was all like--like some trick on the stage,\" the minister went on,\n\"like the magician's disappearing lady, or--or--! It was as though I had\nnot put the money into the safe at all!\"\n\n\"Did you?\" inquired Mr. Grimm amiably.\n\n\"Did I?\" blazed Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez. \"Why, Se\u00c3\u00b1or--! I did!\" he concluded\nmeekly.\n\nMr. Grimm believed him.\n\n\"Who else knows the combination of the safe?\" he queried.\n\n\"No one, Se\u00c3\u00b1or--not a living soul.\"\n\n\"Your secretary, for instance?\"\n\n\"Not even my secretary.\"\n\n\"Some servant--some member of your family?\"\n\n\"I tell you, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, not one person in all the world knew that\ncombination except myself,\" Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez insisted.\n\n\"Your secretary--a servant--some member of your family might have seen\nyou unlock the safe some time, and thus learned the combination?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez did not quite know whether to be annoyed at Mr. Grimm's\npersistence, or to admire the tenacity with which he held to this one\npoint.\n\n\"You must understand, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Grimm, that many state documents are kept\nin the safe,\" he said finally, \"therefore it is not advisable that any\none should know the combination. I have made it an absolute rule, as did\nmy predecessors here, never to unlock the safe in the presence of\nanother person.\"\n\n\"State documents!\" Mr. Grimm's lips silently repeated the words. Then\naloud: \"Perhaps there's a record of the combination somewhere? If you\nhad died suddenly, for instance, how would the safe have been opened?\"\n\n\"There would have been only one way, Se\u00c3\u00b1or--blow it open. There is no\nrecord.\"\n\n\"Well, if we accept all that as true,\" observed Mr. Grimm musingly, \"it\nwould seem that you either didn't put the money into the safe at all,\nor--please sit down, there's nothing personal in this--or else the money\nwas taken out of the safe without it being unlocked. This last would\nhave been a miracle, and this is not the day of miracles, therefore--!\"\n\nMr. Grimm's well modulated voice trailed off into silence. Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nRodriguez came to his feet with a blaze of anger in his eyes; Mr. Grimm\nwas watching him curiously.\n\n\"I understand then, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" said the minister deliberately, \"that you\nbelieve that I--!\"\n\n\"I believe that you have told the truth,\" interrupted Mr. Grimm\nplacidly, \"that is the truth so far as you know it. But you have stated\none thing in error. Somebody besides yourself _does_ know the\ncombination. Whether they knew it or not at this time yesterday I can't\nsay, but somebody knows it now.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez drew a deep breath of relief. The implied accusation had\nbeen withdrawn as pleasantly and frankly as it had been put forward.\n\n\"I ran across a chap in New York once, for instance,\" Mr. Grimm took the\ntrouble to explain, \"who could unlock any safe--that is, any safe of the\nkind used at that time--twelve or fourteen years ago. So you see. I\ndoubt if he would be so successful with the new models, with all their\nimprovements, but then--! You know he would have made an ideal burglar,\nthat chap. Now, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, who lives here in the legation with you?\"\n\n\"My secretary, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Diaz, my daughter Inez, and just at the moment, a\nMiss Thorne--Miss Isabel Thorne,\" the se\u00c3\u00b1or informed him. \"Also four\nservants--two men and two women.\"\n\n\"I've had the pleasure of meeting your daughter and Miss Thorne,\" Mr.\nGrimm informed him. \"Now, suppose we take a look at the safe?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez started toward the closed door just as there came a\ntimid knock from the hall. He glanced at Mr. Grimm, who nodded, then he\ncalled:\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nThe door opened, and Miss Thorne entered. She was clad in some filmy,\ngossamer-like morning gown with her radiant hair caught up on her white\nneck. At sight of Mr. Grimm the blue-gray eyes opened as if in\nsurprise, and she paused irresolutely.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" she said, addressing the diplomatist. \"I did\nnot know you were engaged. And Mr. Grimm!\" She extended a slim, white\nhand, and the young man bowed low over it. \"We are old friends,\" she\nexplained, smilingly, to the minister. Then: \"I think I must have\ndropped my handkerchief when I was in here yesterday with Inez. Perhaps\nyou found it?\"\n\n\"_Si, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita_,\" replied Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez gallantly. \"It is on my desk\nin here. Just a moment.\"\n\nHe opened the door and passed into the adjoining room. Mr. Grimm's eyes\nmet those of Miss Isabel Thorne, and there was no listlessness in them\nnow, only interest. She smiled at him tauntingly and lowered her lids.\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez appeared from the other room with the handkerchief.\n\n\"_Mil gracias, Se\u00c3\u00b1or_,\" she thanked him.\n\n\"_No hay de que, Se\u00c3\u00b1orita_,\" he returned, as he opened the door for\nher.\n\n\"_Monsieur Grimm, au revoir_!\" She dropped a little curtsey, and still\nsmiling, went out.\n\n\"She is charming, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" the diplomatist assured him enthusiastically,\nalbeit irrelevantly. \"Such vivacity, such personality, such--such--she\nis charming.\"\n\n\"The safe, please,\" Mr. Grimm reminded him.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nA SAFE OPENING\n\n\nTogether they entered the adjoining room, which was small compared to\nthe one they had just left. Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez used it as a private office.\nHis desk was on their right between two windows overlooking the same\npleasant little garden which was visible from the suite of tiny\ndrawing-rooms farther along. The safe, a formidable looking receptacle\nof black enameled steel, stood at their left, closed and locked. The\nremaining wall space of the room was given over to oak cabinets,\nevidently a storage place for the less important legation papers.\n\n\"Has any one besides yourself been in this room to-day?\" Mr. Grimm\ninquired.\n\n\"Not a soul, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" was the reply.\n\nMr. Grimm went over and examined the windows. They were both locked\ninside; and there were no marks of any sort on the sills.\n\n\"They are just as I left them last night,\" explained Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez. \"I\nhave not touched them to-day.\"\n\n\"And there's only one door,\" mused Mr. Grimm, meaning that by which they\nhad entered. \"So it would appear that whoever was here last night\nentered through that room. Very well.\"\n\nHe walked around the room once, opening and shutting the doors of the\ncabinets as he passed, and finally paused in front of the safe. A brief\nexamination of the nickeled dial and handle and of the enameled edges of\nthe heavy door satisfied him that no force had been employed--the safe\nhad merely been unlocked. Whereupon he sat himself down, cross-legged on\nthe floor, in front of it.\n\n\"What are the first and second figures of the combination?\" he asked.\n\n\"Thirty-six, then back to ten.\"\n\nMr. Grimm set the dial at thirty-six, and then, with his ear pressed\nclosely against the polished door, turned the dial slowly back. Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nRodriguez stood looking on helplessly, but none the less intently. The\npointer read ten, then nine, eight, seven, five. Mr. Grimm gazed at it\nthoughtfully, after which he did it all over again, placidly and without\nhaste.\n\n\"Now, we'll look inside, please,\" he requested, rising.\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez unlocked the safe the while Mr. Grimm respectfully\nturned his eyes away, then pulled the door wide open. The books had been\npiled one on top of another and thrust into various pigeonholes at the\ntop. Mr. Grimm understood that this disorder was the result of making\nroom at the bottom for the bulk of gold, and asked no questions.\nInstead, he sat down upon the floor again.\n\n\"The lock on this private compartment at the top is broken,\" he remarked\nafter a moment.\n\n\"_Si, Se\u00c3\u00b1or_,\" the diplomatist agreed. \"Evidently the robbers were not\ncontent with only fifty thousand dollars in gold--they imagined that\nsomething else of value was hidden there.\"\n\n\"Was there?\" asked Mr. Grimm naively. He didn't look around.\n\n\"Nothing of monetary value,\" the se\u00c3\u00b1or explained. \"There were some\nimportant state papers in there--they are there yet--but no money.\"\n\n\"None of the papers was stolen?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or. There were only nine packets--they are there yet.\"\n\n\"Contents all right?\"\n\n\"Yes. I personally looked them over.\"\n\nMr. Grimm drew out the packets of papers, one by one. They were all\nunsealed save the last. When he reached for that, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez made a\nquick, involuntary motion toward it with his hand.\n\n\"This one's sealed,\" commented Mr. Grimm. \"It doesn't happen that you\nopened it and sealed it again?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez stood staring at him blankly for a moment, then some\nsudden apprehension was aroused, for a startled look came into his eyes,\nand again he reached for the packet.\n\n\"_Dios mio_!\" he exclaimed, \"let me see, Se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\n\"Going to open it?\" asked Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"Yes, Se\u00c3\u00b1or. I had not thought of it before.\"\n\nMr. Grimm rose and walked over to the window where the light was better.\nHe scrutinized the sealed packet closely. There were three red splotches\nof wax upon it, each impressed with the legation seal; the envelope was\nwithout marks otherwise. He turned and twisted it aimlessly, and peered\ncuriously at the various seals, after which he handed it to the frankly\nimpatient diplomatist.\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez opened it, with nervous, twitching fingers. Mr. Grimm\nhad turned toward the safe again, but he heard the crackle of parchment\nas some document was drawn out of the envelope, and then came a deep\nsigh of relief. Having satisfied his sudden fears for the safety of the\npaper, whatever it was, the se\u00c3\u00b1or placed it in another envelope and\nsealed it again with elaborate care. Mr. Grimm dropped into the swivel\nchair at the desk.\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" he inquired pleasantly, \"your daughter and Miss Thorne were in\nthis room yesterday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the diplomatist as if surprised at the question.\n\n\"What time, please?\"\n\n\"About three o'clock. They were going out driving. Why?\"\n\n\"And just where, please, did you find that handkerchief?\" continued Mr.\nGrimm.\n\n\"Handkerchief?\" repeated the diplomatist. \"You mean Miss Thorne's\nhandkerchief?\" He paused and regarded Mr. Grimm keenly. \"Se\u00c3\u00b1or, what am\nI to understand from that question?\"\n\n\"It was plain enough,\" replied Mr. Grimm. \"Where did you find that\nhandkerchief?\" There was silence for an instant. \"In this room?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez at last.\n\n\"Near the safe?\" Mr. Grimm persisted.\n\n\"Yes,\" came the slow reply, again. \"Just here,\" and he indicated a spot\na little to the left of the safe.\n\n\"And _when_ did you find it? Yesterday afternoon? Last night? This\nmorning?\"\n\n\"This morning,\" and without any apparent reason the diplomatist's face\nturned deathly white.\n\n\"But, Se\u00c3\u00b1or--Se\u00c3\u00b1or, you are mistaken! There can be nothing--! A woman!\nTwo hundred pounds of gold! Se\u00c3\u00b1or!\"\n\nMr. Grimm was still pleasant about it; his curiosity was absolutely\nimpersonal; his eyes, grown listless again, were turned straight into\nthe other's face.\n\n\"If that handkerchief had been there last night, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" he resumed\nquietly, \"wouldn't you have noticed it when you placed the gold in the\nsafe?\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez stared at him a long time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, at last. He dropped back into a chair with his\nface in his hands. \"Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" he burst out suddenly, impetuously, after a\nmoment, \"if the gold is not recovered I am ruined. You understand that\nbetter than I can tell you. It's the kind of thing that could not be\nexplained to my government.\" He rose suddenly and faced the impassive\nyoung man, with merciless determination in his face. \"You must find the\ngold, Se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" he said.\n\n\"No matter who may be--who may suffer?\" inquired Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"Find the gold, Se\u00c3\u00b1or!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" commented Mr. Grimm, without moving. \"Do me the favor,\nplease, to regain possession of the handkerchief you just returned to\nMiss Thorne, and to send to me here your secretary, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Diaz, and your\nservants, one by one. I shall question them alone. No, don't be alarmed.\nUnless they know of the robbery they shall get no inkling of it from me.\nFirst, be good enough to replace the packet in the safe, and lock it.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez replaced the packet without question, afterward locking\nthe door, then went out. A moment later Se\u00c3\u00b1or Diaz appeared. He remained\nwith Mr. Grimm for just eight minutes. Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez entered again as\nhis secretary passed on, and laid a lace handkerchief on the desk. Mr.\nGrimm stared at it curiously for a long time.\n\n\"It's the same handkerchief?\"\n\n\"_Si, Se\u00c3\u00b1or_.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt whatever about it?\"\n\n\"No, Se\u00c3\u00b1or, I got it by--!\"\n\n\"It's of no consequence,\" interrupted Mr. Grimm. \"Now the servants,\nplease--the men first.\"\n\nThe first of the men servants was in the room two minutes; the\nsecond--the butler--was there five minutes; one of the women was not\nquestioned at all; the other remained ten minutes. Mr. Grimm followed\nher into the hall; Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez stood there helpless, impatient.\n\n\"Well?\" he demanded eagerly.\n\n\"I'm going out a little while,\" replied Mr. Grimm placidly. \"No one has\neven an intimation of the affair--please keep the matter absolutely to\nyourself until I return.\"\n\nThat was all. The door opened and closed, and he was gone.\n\nAt the end of an hour he returned, passed on through to the\ndiplomatist's private office, sat down in front of the locked safe\nagain, and set the dial at thirty-six. Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez looked on,\nastonished, as Mr. Grimm pressed the soft rubber sounder of a\nstethoscope against the safe door and began turning the dial back toward\nten, slowly, slowly. Thirty-five minutes later the lock clicked. Mr.\nGrimm rose, turned the handle, and pulled the safe door open.\n\n\"That's how it was done,\" he explained to the amazed diplomatist. \"And\nnow, please, have a servant hand my card to Miss Thorne.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE LACE HANDKERCHIEF\n\n\nStill wearing the graceful, filmy morning gown, with an added touch, of\nscarlet in her hair--a single red rose--Miss Thorne came into the\ndrawing-room where Mr. Grimm sat waiting. There was curiosity in her\nmanner, thinly veiled, but the haunting smile still lingered about her\nlips. Mr. Grimm bowed low, and placed a chair for her, after which he\nstood for a time staring down at one slim, white hand at rest on the arm\nof the seat. At last, he, too, sat down.\n\n\"I believe,\" he said slowly, without preliminaries, \"this is your\nhandkerchief?\"\n\nHe offered the lacy trifle, odd in design, unique in workmanship,\nobviously of foreign texture, and she accepted it.\n\n\"Yes,\" she agreed readily, \"I must have dropped it again.\"\n\n\"That is the one handed to you by Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez,\" Mr. Grimm told her.\n\"I think you said you lost it in his office yesterday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" She nodded inquiringly.\n\n\"It may interest you to know that Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez's butler positively\nidentifies it as one he restored to you twice at dinner last evening,\nbetween seven and nine o'clock,\" Mr. Grimm went on dispassionately.\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Miss Thorne.\n\n\"The se\u00c3\u00b1or identifies it as one he found this morning in his office,\"\nMr. Grimm explained obligingly. \"During the night fifty thousand dollars\nin gold were stolen from his safe.\"\n\nThere was not the slightest change of expression in her face; the\nblue-gray eyes were still inquiring in their gaze, the white hands still\nat rest, the scarlet lips still curled slightly, an echo of a smile.\n\n\"No force was used in opening the safe,\" Mr. Grimm resumed. \"It was\nunlocked. It's an old model and I have demonstrated how it could have\nbeen opened either with the assistance of a stethoscope, which catches\nthe sound of the tumbler in the lock, or by a person of acute hearing.\"\n\nMiss Thorne sat motionless, waiting.\n\n\"All this means--what?\" she inquired, at length.\n\n\"I'll trouble you, please, to return the money,\" requested Mr. Grimm\ncourteously. \"No reason appears why you should have taken it. But I'm\nnot seeking reasons, nor am I seeking disagreeable publicity--only the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"It seems to me you attach undue importance to the handkerchief,\" she\nobjected.\n\n\"That's a matter of opinion,\" Mr. Grimm remarked. \"It would be useless,\neven tedious, to attempt to disprove a burglar theory, but against it is\nthe difficulty of entrance, the weight of the gold, the ingenious method\nof opening the safe, and the assumption that not more than six persons\nknew the money was in the safe; while a person in the house _might_ have\nlearned it in any of a dozen ways. And, in addition, is the fact that\nthe handkerchief is odd, therefore noticeable. A lace expert assures me\nthere's probably not another like it in the world.\"\n\nHe stopped. Miss Thorne's eyes sparkled and a smile seemed to be tugging\nat the corners of her mouth. She spread out the handkerchief on her\nknees.\n\n\"You could identify this again, of course?\" she queried.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe thoughtfully crumpled up the bit of lace in both hands, then opened\nthem. There were two handkerchiefs now--they were identical.\n\n\"Which is it, please?\" she asked.\n\nIf Mr. Grimm was disappointed there was not a trace of it on his face.\nShe laughed outright, gleefully, mockingly, then, demurely:\n\n\"Pardon me! You see, it's absurd. The handkerchief the butler restored\nto me at dinner, after I lost one in the se\u00c3\u00b1or's office, might have been\neither of these, or one of ten other duplicates in my room, all given to\nme by her Maj--I mean,\" she corrected quickly, \"by a friend in Europe.\"\nShe was silent for a moment. \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Grimm gravely, decisively. \"I'm not satisfied. I shall\ninsist upon the return of the money, and if it is not forthcoming I dare\nsay Count di Rosini, the Italian ambassador, would be pleased to give\nhis personal check rather than have the matter become public.\" She\nstarted to interrupt; he went on. \"In any event you will be requested to\nleave the country.\"\n\nThen, and not until then, a decided change came over Miss Thorne's face.\nA deeper color leaped to her cheeks, the smile faded from her lips, and\nthere was a flash of uneasiness in her eyes.\n\n\"But if I am innocent?\" she protested.\n\n\"You must prove it,\" continued Mr. Grimm mercilessly. \"Personally, I am\nconvinced, and Count di Rosini has practically assured me that--\"\n\n\"It's unjust!\" she interrupted passionately. \"It's--it's--you have\nproved nothing. It's unheard of! It's beyond--!\"\n\nSuddenly she became silent. A minute, two minutes, three minutes passed;\nMr. Grimm waited patiently.\n\n\"Will you give me time and opportunity to prove my innocence?\" she\ndemanded finally. \"And if I _do_ convince you--?\"\n\n\"I should be delighted to believe that I have made a mistake,\" Mr. Grimm\nassured her. \"How much time? One day? Two days?\"\n\n\"I will let you know within an hour at your office,\" she told him.\n\nMr. Grimm rose.\n\n\"And meanwhile, in case of accident, I shall look to Count di Rosini for\nadjustment,\" he added pointedly. \"Good morning.\"\n\nOne hour and ten minutes later he received this note, unsigned:\n\n\"Closed carriage will stop for you at southeast corner of Pennsylvania\nAvenue and Fourteenth Street to-night at one.\"\n\nHe was there; the carriage was on time; and my lady of mystery was\ninside. He stepped in and they swung out into Pennsylvania Avenue,\nnoiselessly over the asphalt.\n\n\"Should the gold be placed in your hands now, within the hour,\" she\nqueried solicitously, \"would it be necessary for you to know who was\nthe--the thief?\"\n\n\"It would,\" Mr. Grimm responded without hesitation.\n\n\"Even if it destroyed a reputation?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"The Secret Service rarely destroys a reputation, Miss Thorne, although\nit holds itself in readiness to do so. I dare say in this case there\nwould be no arrest or prosecution, because of--of reasons which appear\nto be good.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't?\" and there was a note of eagerness in her voice. \"The\nidentity of the guilty person would never appear?\"\n\n\"It would become a matter of record in our office, but beyond that I\nthink not--at least in this one instance.\"\n\nMiss Thorne sat silent for a block or more.\n\n\"You'll admit, Mr. Grimm, that you have forced me into a most remarkable\nposition. You seemed convinced of my guilt, and, if you'll pardon me,\nwithout reason; then you made it compulsory upon me to establish my\ninnocence. The only way for me to do that was to find the guilty one. I\nhave done it, and I'm sorry, because it's a little tragedy.\"\n\nMr. Grimm waited.\n\n\"It's a girl high in diplomatic society. Her father's position is an\nhonorable rather than a lucrative one; he has no fortune. This girl\nmoves in a certain set devoted to bridge, and stakes are high. She\nplayed and won, and played and won, and on and on, until her winnings\nwere about eight thousand dollars. Then luck turned. She began to lose.\nHer money went, but she continued to play desperately. Finally some old\nfamily jewels were pawned without her father's knowledge, and ultimately\nthey were lost. One day she awoke to the fact that she owed some nine or\nten thousand dollars in bridge debts. They were pressing and there was\nno way to meet them. This meant exposure and utter ruin, and women do\nstrange things, Mr. Grimm, to postpone such an ending to social\naspirations. I know this much is true, for she related it all to me\nherself.\n\n\"At last, in some way--a misplaced letter, perhaps, or a word\noverheard--she learned that fifty thousand dollars would be in the\nlegation safe overnight, and evidently she learned the precise night.\"\nShe paused a moment. \"Here is the address of a man in Baltimore, Thomas\nQ. Griswold,\" and she passed a card to Mr. Grimm, who sat motionless,\nlistening. \"About four years ago the combination on the legation safe\nwas changed. This man was sent here to make the change, therefore some\none besides Se\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez _does_ know the combination. I have\ncommunicated with this man to-day, for I saw the possibility of just\nsuch a thing as this instead of your stethoscope. By a trick and a\nforged letter this girl obtained the combination from this man.\"\n\nMr. Grimm drew a long breath.\n\n\"She intended to take, perhaps, only what she desperately needed--but at\nsight of it all--do you see what must have been the temptation then? We\nget out here.\"\n\nThere were many unanswered questions in Mr. Grimm's mind. He repressed\nthem for the time, stepped out and assisted Miss Thorne to alight. The\ncarriage had turned out of Pennsylvania Avenue, and at the moment he\ndidn't quite place himself. A narrow passageway opened before\nthem--evidently the rear entrance to a house possibly in the next\nstreet. Miss Thorne led the way unhesitatingly, cautiously unlocked the\ndoor, and together they entered a hall. Then there was a short flight of\nstairs, and they stepped into a room, one of a suite. She closed the\ndoor and turned on the lights.\n\n\"The bags of gold are in the next room,\" she said with the utmost\ncomposure.\n\nMr. Grimm dragged them out of a dark closet, opened one--there were\nten--and allowed the coins to dribble through his fingers. Finally he\nturned and stared at Miss Thorne, who, pallid and weary, stood looking\non.\n\n\"Where are we?\" he asked. \"What house is this?\"\n\n\"The Venezuelan legation,\" she answered. \"We are standing less than\nforty feet from the safe that was robbed. You see how easy--!\"\n\n\"And whose room?\" inquired Mr. Grimm slowly.\n\n\"Must I answer?\" she asked appealingly.\n\n\"You must!\"\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez--my hostess! Don't you see what you've made me do?\nShe and Mr. Cadwallader made the trip to Baltimore in his automobile,\nand--and--!\" She stopped. \"He knows nothing of it,\" she added.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mr. Grimm.\n\nHe stood looking at her in silence for a moment, staring deeply into the\npleading eyes; and a certain tense expression about his lips passed. For\nan instant her hand trembled on his arm, and he caught the fragrance of\nher hair.\n\n\"Where is she now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Playing bridge,\" replied Miss Thorne, with a sad little smile. \"It is\nalways so--at least twice a week, and she rarely returns before two or\nhalf-past.\" She extended both hands impetuously, entreatingly. \"Please\nbe generous, Mr. Grimm. You have the gold; don't destroy her.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1or Rodriguez, the minister from Venezuela, found the gold in his safe\non the following morning, with a brief note from Mr. Grimm, in which\nthere was no explanation of how or where it had been found.... And two\nhours later Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, ambassador from France to the United\nStates, disappeared from the embassy, vanished!\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE VANISHING DIPLOMATIST\n\n\nIt was three days after the ambassador's disappearance that Monsieur\nRigolot, secretary of the French embassy and temporary\n_charg\u00c3\u00a9-d'affaires_, reported the matter to Chief Campbell in the Secret\nService Bureau, adding thereto a detailed statement of several singular\nincidents following close upon it. He told it in order, concisely and to\nthe point, while Grimm and his chief listened.\n\n\"Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, the ambassador, you understand, is a man whose\nhabits are remarkably regular,\" he began. \"He has made it a rule to be\nat his desk every morning at ten o'clock, and between that time and one\no'clock he dictates his correspondence, and clears up whatever routine\nwork there is before him. I have known him for many years, and have\nbeen secretary of the embassy under him in Germany and Japan and this\ncountry. I have never known him to vary this general order of work\nunless because of illness, or necessary absence.\n\n\"Well, Monsieur, last Tuesday--this is Friday--the ambassador was at his\ndesk as usual. He dictated a dozen or more letters, and had begun\nanother--a private letter to his sister in Paris. He was well along in\nthis letter when, without any apparent reason, he rose from his desk and\nleft the room, closing the door behind him. His stenographer's\nimpression was that some detail of business had occurred to him, and he\nhad gone into the general office farther down the hall to attend to it.\nI may say, Monsieur, that this impression seemed strengthened by the\nfact that he left a fresh cigarette burning in his ash tray, and his pen\nwas behind his ear. It was all as if he had merely stepped out,\nintending to return immediately--the sort of thing, Monsieur, that any\nman might have done.\n\n\"It so happened that when he went out he left a sentence of his letter\nincomplete. I tell you this to show that the impulse to go must have\nbeen a sudden one, yet there was nothing in his manner, so his\nstenographer says, to indicate excitement, or any other than his usual\nframe of mind. It was about five minutes of twelve o'clock--high\nnoon--when he went out. When he didn't return immediately the\nstenographer began transcribing the letters. At one o'clock Monsieur\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur still had not returned and his stenographer went to luncheon.\"\n\nAs he talked some inbred excitement seemed to be growing upon him, due,\nperhaps, to his recital of the facts, and he paused at last to regain\ncontrol of himself. Incidentally he wondered if Mr. Grimm was taking the\nslightest interest in what he was saying. Certainly there was nothing in\nhis impassive face to indicate it.\n\n\"Understand, Monsieur,\" the secretary continued, after a moment, \"that I\nknew nothing whatever of all this until late that afternoon--that is,\nTuesday afternoon about five o'clock. I was engaged all day upon some\nimportant work in my own office, and had had no occasion to see Monsieur\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur since a word or so when he came in at ten o'clock. My\nattention was called to the affair finally by his stenographer, Monsieur\nNetterville, who came to me for instructions. He had finished the\nletters and the ambassador had not returned to sign them. At this point\nI began an investigation, Monsieur, and the further I went the more\nuneasy I grew.\n\n\"Now, Monsieur, there are only two entrances to the embassy--the front\ndoor, where a servant is in constant attendance from nine in the morning\nuntil ten at night, and the rear door, which can only be reached through\nthe kitchen. Neither of the two men who had been stationed at the front\ndoor had seen the ambassador since breakfast, therefore he could not\nhave gone out that way. _Comprenez_? It seemed ridiculous, Monsieur, but\nthen I went to the kitchen. The _chef_ had been there all day, and he\nhad not seen the ambassador at all. I inquired further. No one in the\nembassy, not a clerk, nor a servant, nor a member of the ambassador's\nfamily had seen him since he left his office.\"\n\nAgain he paused and ran one hand across his troubled brow.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he went on, and there was a tense note in his voice, \"the\nambassador of France had disappeared, gone, vanished! We searched the\nhouse from the cellar to the servants' quarters, even the roof, but\nthere was no trace of him. The hat he usually wore was in the hall, and\nall his other hats were accounted for. You may remember, Monsieur, that\nTuesday was cold, but all his top-coats were found in their proper\nplaces. So it seems, Monsieur,\" and repression ended in a burst of\nexcitement, \"if he left the embassy he did not go out by either door,\nand he went without hat or coat!\"\n\nHe stopped helplessly and his gaze alternated inquiringly between the\nbenevolent face of the chief and the expressionless countenance of Mr.\nGrimm.\n\n\"_If_ he left the embassy?\" Mr. Grimm repeated. \"If your search of the\nhouse proved conclusively that he wasn't there, he _did_ leave it,\ndidn't he?\"\n\nMonsieur Rigolot stared at him blankly for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"And there are windows, you know,\" Mr. Grimm went on, then: \"As I\nunderstand it, Monsieur, no one except you and the stenographer saw the\nambassador after ten o'clock in the morning?\"\n\n\"_Oui, Monsieur. C'est--_\" Monsieur Rigolot began excitedly. \"I beg\npardon. I believe that is correct.\"\n\n\"You saw him about ten, you say; therefore no one except the\nstenographer saw him after ten o'clock?\"\n\n\"That is also true, as far as I know.\"\n\n\"Any callers? Letters? Telegrams? Telephone messages?\"\n\n\"I made inquiries in that direction, Monsieur,\" was the reply. \"I have\nthe words of the servants at the door and of the stenographer that there\nwere no callers, and the statement of the stenographer that there were\nno telephone calls or telegrams. There were only four letters for him\npersonally. He left them all on his desk--here they are.\"\n\nMr. Grimm looked them over leisurely. They were commonplace enough,\ncontaining nothing that might be construed into a reason for the\ndisappearance.\n\n\"The letters Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur had dictated were laid on his desk by\nthe stenographer,\" Monsieur Rigolot rushed on volubly, excitedly. \"In\nthe anxiety and uneasiness following the disappearance they were allowed\nto remain there overnight. On Wednesday morning, Monsieur\"--and he\nhesitated impressively--\"_those letters bore his signature in his own\nhandwriting_!\"\n\nMr. Grimm turned his listless eyes full upon Monsieur Rigolot's\nperturbed face for one scant instant.\n\n\"No doubt of it being his signature?\" he queried.\n\n\"_Non, Monsieur, non!_\" the secretary exclaimed emphatically. \"_Vous\navez_--that is, I have known his signature for years. There is no doubt.\nThe letters were not of a private nature. If you would care to look at\ncopies of them?\"\n\nHe offered the duplicates tentatively. Mr. Grimm read them over slowly,\nthe while Monsieur Rigolot sat nervously staring at him. They, too,\nseemed meaningless as bearing on the matter in hand. Finally, Mr. Grimm\nnodded, and Monsieur Rigolot resumed:\n\n\"And Wednesday night, Monsieur, another strange thing happened. Monsieur\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur smokes many cigarettes, of a kind made especially for him in\nFrance, and shipped to him here. He keeps them in a case on his\ndressing-table. On Thursday morning his valet reported to me that _this\ncase of cigarettes had disappeared_!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" observed Mr. Grimm, \"Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur has a latch-key to\nthe embassy?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Anything unusual happen last night--that is, Thursday night?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Monsieur--that is, nothing we can find.\"\n\nMr. Grimm was silent for a time and fell to twisting the seal ring on\nhis finger. Mr. Campbell turned around and moved a paper weight one inch\nto the left, where it belonged, while Monsieur Rigolot, disappointed at\ntheir amazing apathy, squirmed uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"It would appear, then,\" Mr. Grimm remarked musingly, \"that after his\nmysterious disappearance the ambassador has either twice returned to his\nhouse at night, or else sent some one there, first to bring the letters\nto him for signature, and later to get his cigarettes?\"\n\n\"_Certainement, Monsieur_--I mean, that seems to be true. But where is\nhe? Why should he not come back? What does it mean? Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur is\nfrantic, prostrated! She wanted me to go to the police, but I did not\nthink it wise that it should become public, so I came here.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" commented Mr. Grimm. \"Let it rest as it is. Meanwhile you\nmay reassure madame. Point out to her that if Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur signed\nthe letters Tuesday night he was, at least, alive; and if he came or\nsent for the cigarettes Wednesday night, he was still alive. I shall\ncall at the embassy this afternoon. No, it isn't advisable to go with\nyou now. Give me your latch-key, please.\"\n\nMonsieur Rigolot produced the key and passed it over without a word.\n\n\"And one other thing,\" Mr. Grimm continued, \"please collect all the\nrevolvers that may be in the house and take charge of them yourself. If\nany one, by chance, heard a burglar prowling around there to-night he\nmight shoot, and in that event either kill Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur or--or\nme!\"\n\nWhen the secretary had gone Mr. Campbell idly drummed on his desk as he\nstudied the face of his subordinate.\n\n\"So much!\" he commented finally.\n\n\"It's Miss Thorne again,\" said the young man as if answering a question.\n\n\"Perhaps these reports I have received to-day from the Latin capitals\nmay aid you in dispelling that mystery,\" Campbell suggested, and Mr.\nGrimm turned to them eagerly. \"Meanwhile our royal visitor, Prince\nBenedetto d'Abruzzi, remains unknown?\"\n\nThe young man's teeth closed with a snap.\n\n\"It's only a question of time, Chief,\" he said abruptly. \"I'll find\nhim--I'll find him!\"\n\nAnd he sat down to read the reports.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nA CONFERENCE IN THE DARK\n\n\nThe white rays of a distant arc light filtered through the half-drawn\nvelvet hangings and laid a faintly illumined path across the\nambassador's desk; the heavy leather chairs were mere impalpable\nsplotches in the shadows; the cut-glass knobs of a mahogany cabinet\ncaught the glint of light and reflected it dimly. Outside was the vague,\nindefinable night drone of a city asleep, unbroken by any sound that was\ndistinguishable, until finally there came the distant boom of a clock.\nIt struck twice.\n\nSeated on a couch in one corner of the ambassador's office was Mr.\nGrimm. He was leaning against the high arm of leather, with his feet on\nthe seat, thoughtfully nursing his knees. If his attitude indicated\nanything except sheer comfort, it was that he was listening. He had been\nthere for two hours, wide-awake, and absolutely motionless. Five, ten,\nfifteen minutes more passed, and then Mr. Grimm heard the grind and whir\nof an automobile a block or so away, coming toward the embassy. Now it\nwas in front.\n\n\"Honk! Hon-on-onk!\" it called plaintively. \"Hon-on-onk! Honk!\"\n\nThe signal! At last! The automobile went rushing on, full tilt, while\nMr. Grimm removed his feet from the seat and dropped them noiselessly to\nthe floor. Thus, with his hands on his knees, and listening, listening\nwith every faculty strained, he sat motionless, peering toward the open\ndoor that led into the hall. The car was gone now, the sound of it was\nswallowed up in the distance, still he sat there. It was obviously some\nnoise in the house for which he was waiting.\n\nMinute after minute passed, and still nothing. There was not even the\nwhisper of a wind-stirred drapery. He was about to rise when, suddenly,\nwith no other noise than that of the sharp click of the switch, the\nelectric lights in the room blazed up brilliantly. The glare dazzled Mr.\nGrimm with its blinding flood, but he didn't move. Then softly, almost\nin a whisper:\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Grimm.\"\n\nIt was a woman's voice, pleasant, unsurprised, perfectly modulated. Mr.\nGrimm certainly did not expect it now, but he knew it instantly--there\nwas not another quite like it in the wide, wide world--and though he was\nstill blinking a little, he came to his feet courteously.\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Thorne,\" he corrected gravely.\n\nNow his vision was clearing, and he saw her, a graceful figure,\nsilhouetted against the rich green of the wall draperies. Her lips were\ncurled the least bit, as if she might have been smiling, and her\nwonderful eyes reflected a glint of--of--was it amusement? The folds of\nher evening dress fell away from her, and one bare, white arm was\nextended, as her hand still rested on the switch.\n\n\"And you didn't hear me?\" still in the half whisper. \"I didn't think you\nwould. Now I'm going to put out the lights for an instant, while you\npull the shades down, and then--then we must have a--a conference.\"\n\nThe switch snapped. The lights died as suddenly as they had been born,\nand Mr. Grimm, moving noiselessly, visited each of the four windows in\nturn. Then the lights blazed brilliantly again.\n\n\"Just for a moment,\" Miss Thorne explained to him quietly, and she\nhanded him a sheet of paper. \"I want you to read this--read it\ncarefully--then I shall turn out the lights again. They are dangerous.\nAfter that we may discuss the matter at our leisure.\"\n\nMr. Grimm read the paper while Miss Thorne's eyes questioned his\nimpassive face. At length he looked up indolently, listlessly, and the\nswitch snapped. She crossed the room and sat down; Mr. Grimm sat beside\nher.\n\n\"I think,\" Miss Thorne suggested tentatively, \"that that accounts\nperfectly for Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur's disappearance.\"\n\n\"It gives one explanation, at least,\" Mr. Grimm assented musingly.\n\"Kidnapped--held prisoner--fifty thousand dollars demanded for his\nsafety and release.\" A pause. \"And to whom, may I ask, was this demand\naddressed?\"\n\n\"To Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur,\" replied Miss Thorne. \"I have the envelope in\nwhich it came. It was mailed at the general post-office at half-past one\no'clock this afternoon, so the canceling stamp shows, and the envelope\nwas addressed, as the letter was written, on a typewriter.\"\n\n\"And how,\" inquired Mr. Grimm, after a long pause, \"how did it come into\nyour possession?\" He waited a little. \"Why didn't Monsieur Rigolot\nreport this development to me this afternoon when I was here?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Rigolot did not inform you of it because he didn't know of it\nhimself,\" she replied, answering the last question first. \"It came into\nmy possession directly from the hands of Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur--she gave it\nto me.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nMr. Grimm was peering through the inscrutable darkness, straight into\nher face--a white daub in the gloom, shapeless, indistinct.\n\n\"I have known Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur for half a dozen years,\" Miss Thorne\ncontinued, in explanation. \"We have been friends that long. I met her\nfirst in Tokio, later in Berlin, and within a few weeks, here in\nWashington. You see I have traveled in the time I have been an agent for\nmy government. Well, Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur received this letter about\nhalf-past four o'clock this afternoon; and about half-past five she sent\nfor me and placed it in my hands, together with all the singular details\nfollowing upon the ambassador's disappearance. So, it would seem that\nyou and I are allies for this once, and the problem is already solved.\nThere merely remains the task of finding and releasing the ambassador.\"\n\nMr. Grimm sat perfectly still.\n\n\"And why,\" he asked slowly, \"are you here now?\"\n\n\"For the same reason that you are here,\" she replied readily, \"to see\nfor myself if the--the person who twice came here at night--once for the\nambassador's letters and once for his cigarettes--would, by any chance,\nmake another trip. I knew you were here, of course.\"\n\n\"You knew I was here,\" repeated Mr. Grimm musingly. \"And, may I--?\"\n\n\"Just as you knew that I, or some one, at least, had entered this house\na few minutes ago,\" she interrupted. \"The automobile horn outside was a\nsignal, wasn't it? Hastings was in the car? Or was it Blair or Johnson?\"\n\nMr. Grimm did not say.\n\n\"Didn't you anticipate any personal danger when you entered?\" he queried\ninstead. \"Weren't you afraid I might shoot?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. Mr. Grimm still sat with his elbows on his\nknees, staring, staring at the vague white splotch which was Miss\nThorne's face and bare neck. One of her white arms hung at her side like\na pallid serpent, and her hand was at rest on the seat of the couch.\n\n\"It seems, Miss Thorne,\" he said at length, casually, quite casually,\n\"that our paths of duty are inextricably tangled. Twice previously we\nhave met under circumstances that were more than strange, and now--this!\nWhatever injustice I may have done you in the past by my suspicions has,\nI hope, been forgiven; and in each instance we were able to work side by\nside toward a conclusion. I am wondering now if this singular affair\nwill take a similar course.\"\n\nHe paused. Miss Thorne started to speak, but he silenced her with a\nslight gesture of his hand.\n\n\"It is only fair to you to say that we--that is, the Secret\nService--have learned many things about you,\" he resumed in the same\ncasual tone. \"We have, through our foreign agents, traced you step by\nstep from Rome to Washington. We know that you are, in a way, a\nrepresentative of a sovereign of Europe; we know that you were on a\nsecret mission to the Spanish court, perhaps for this sovereign, and\nremained in Madrid for a month; we know that from there you went to\nParis, also on a secret mission--perhaps the same--and remained there\nfor three weeks; we know that you met diplomatic agents of those\ngovernments later in London. We know all this; we know the manner of\nyour coming to this country; of your coming to Washington. But we don't\nknow _why_ you are here.\"\n\nAgain she started to speak, and again he stopped her.\n\n\"We don't know your name, but that is of no consequence. We _do_ know\nthat in Spain you were Se\u00c3\u00b1ora Cassavant, in Paris Mademoiselle\nd'Aubinon, in London Miss Jane Kellog, and here Miss Isabel Thorne. We\nrealize that exigencies arise in your calling, and mine, which make\nchanges of name desirable, necessary even, and there is no criticism of\nthat. Now as the representative of your government--rather _a_\ngovernment--you have a right to be here, although unaccredited; you have\na right to remain here as long as your acts are consistent with our\nlaws; you have a right to your secrets as long as they do not, directly\nor indirectly, threaten the welfare of this country. Now, why are you\nhere?\"\n\nHe received no answer; he expected none. After a moment he went on:\n\n\"Admitting that you are a secret agent of Italy, admitting everything\nthat you claim to be, you haven't convinced me that you are not the\nperson who came here for the letters and cigarettes. You have said\nnothing to prove to my satisfaction that you are not the individual I\nwas waiting for to-night.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that you suspect--?\" she began in a tone of amazement.\n\n\"I don't mean that I suspect anything,\" he interposed. \"I mean merely\nthat you haven't convinced me. There's nothing inconsistent in the fact\nthat you are what you say you are, and that in spite of that, you came\nto-night for--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a laugh, a throaty, silvery note that he\nremembered well. His idle hands closed spasmodically, only to be\ninstantly relaxed.\n\n\"Suppose, Mr. Grimm, I should tell you that immediately after Madame\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur placed the matter in my hands this afternoon I went straight\nto your office to show this letter to you and to ask your assistance?\"\nshe inquired. \"Suppose that I left my card for you with a clerk there on\nbeing informed that you were out--remember I knew you were on the case\nfrom Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur--would that indicate anything except that I wanted\nto put the matter squarely before you, and work with you?\"\n\n\"We will suppose that much,\" Mr. Grimm agreed.\n\n\"That is a statement of fact,\" Miss Thorne added. \"My card, which you\nwill find at your office, will show that. And when I left your office I\nwent to the hotel where you live, with the same purpose. You were not\nthere, and I left a card for you. And _that_ is a statement of fact. It\nwas not difficult, owing to the extraordinary circumstances, to imagine\nthat you would be here to-night--just as you are--and I came here. My\npurpose, still, was to inform you of what I knew, and work with you.\nDoes that convince you?\"\n\n\"And how did you enter the embassy?\" Mr. Grimm persisted.\n\n\"Not with a latch-key, as you did,\" she replied. \"Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, at\nmy suggestion, left the French window in the hall there unfastened, and\nI came in that way--the way, I may add, that _Monsieur l'Ambassadeur_\nwent out when he disappeared.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" commented Mr. Grimm, and finally: \"I think, perhaps, I owe\nyou an apology, Miss Thorne--another one. The circumstances now, as\nthey were at our previous meetings, are so unusual that--is it necessary\nto go on?\" There was a certain growing deference in his tone. \"I wonder\nif you account for Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur's disappearance as I do?\" he\ninquired.\n\n\"I dare say,\" and Miss Thorne leaned toward him with sudden eagerness in\nher manner and voice. \"Your theory is--?\" she questioned.\n\n\"If we believe the servants we know that Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur did not go\nout either by the front door or rear,\" Mr. Grimm explained. \"That being\ntrue the French window by which you entered seems to have been the way.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" Miss Thorne interpolated. \"And the circumstances attending\nthe disappearance? How do you account for the fact that he went,\nevidently of his own will?\"\n\n\"Precisely as you must account for it if you have studied the situation\nhere as I have,\" responded Mr. Grimm. \"For instance, sitting at his desk\nthere\"--and he turned to indicate it--\"he could readily see out the\nwindows overlooking the street. There is only a narrow strip of lawn\nbetween the house and the sidewalk. Now, if some one on the sidewalk,\nor--or--\"\n\n\"In a carriage?\" promptly suggested Miss Thorne.\n\n\"Or in a carriage,\" Mr. Grimm supplemented, \"had attracted his\nattention--some one he knew--it is not at all unlikely that he rose, for\nno apparent reason, as he did do, passed along the hall--\"\n\n\"And through the French window, across the lawn to the carriage, and not\na person in the house would have seen him go out? Precisely! There seems\nno doubt that was the way,\" she mused. \"And, of course, he must have\nentered the carriage of his own free will?\"\n\n\"In other words, on some pretext or other, he was lured in, then made\nprisoner, and--!\"\n\nHe paused suddenly and his hand met Miss Thorne's warningly. The silence\nof the night was broken by the violent clatter of footsteps, apparently\napproaching the embassy. The noise was unmistakable--some one was\nrunning.\n\n\"The window!\" Miss Thorne whispered.\n\nShe rose quickly and started to cross the room, to look out; Mr. Grimm\nsat motionless, listening. An instant later and there came a tremendous\ncrash of glass--the French window in the hallway by the sound--then\nrapid footsteps, still running, along the hall. Mr. Grimm moved toward\nthe door unruffled, perfectly self-possessed; there was only a narrowing\nof his eyes at the abruptness and clatter of it all. And then the\nelectric lights in the hall flashed up.\n\nBefore Mr. Grimm stood a man, framed by the doorway, staring unseeingly\ninto the darkened room. His face was haggard and white as death; his\nmouth agape as if from exertion, and the lips bloodless; his eyes were\nwidely distended as if from fright--clothing disarranged, collar\nunfastened and dangling.\n\n\"The ambassador!\" Miss Thorne whispered thrillingly.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nA RESCUE AND AN ESCAPE\n\n\nMiss Thorne's voice startled Mr. Grimm a little, but he had no doubts.\nIt was Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur. Mr. Grimm was going toward the enframed\nfigure when, without any apparent reason, the ambassador turned and ran\nalong the hall; and at that instant the lights went out again. For one\nmoment Grimm stood still, dazed and blinded by the sudden blackness, and\nagain he started toward the door. Miss Thorne was beside him.\n\n\"The lights!\" he whispered tensely. \"Find the switch!\"\n\nHe heard the rustle of her skirts as she moved away, and stepped out\ninto the hall, feeling with both his hands along the wall. A few feet\naway, in the direction the ambassador had gone, there seemed to be a\nviolent struggle in progress--there was the scuffling of feet, and\nquick-drawn breaths as muscle strained against muscle. The lights! If he\ncould only find the switch! Then, as his hands moved along the wall,\nthey came in contact with another hand--a hand pressed firmly against\nthe plastering, barring his progress. A light blow in the face caused\nhim to step back quickly.\n\nThe scuffling sound suddenly resolved itself into moving footsteps, and\nthe front door opened and closed with a bang. Mr. Grimm's listless eyes\nsnapped, and his white teeth came together sharply as he started toward\nthe front door. But fate seemed to be against him still. He stumbled\nover a chair, and his own impetus forward sent him sprawling; his head\nstruck the wall with a resounding whack; and then, over the house, came\nutter silence. From outside he heard the clatter of a cab. Finally that\ndied away in the distance.\n\n\"Miss Thorne?\" he inquired quietly.\n\n\"I'm here,\" she answered in a despairing voice. \"But I can't find the\nswitch.\"\n\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd then she found the switch; the lights flared up. Mr. Grimm was\nsitting thoughtfully on the floor.\n\n\"That simplifies the matter considerably,\" he observed complacently, as\nhe rose. \"The men who signaled to me when you entered the embassy will\nnever let that cab get out of their sight.\"\n\nMiss Thorne stood leaning forward a little, eagerly gazing at him with\nthose wonderful blue-gray eyes, and an expression of--of--perhaps it was\nadmiration on her face.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" she demanded, at last.\n\n\"I know it,\" was his response.\n\nAnd just then Monsieur Rigolot, secretary of the embassy, thrust an\ninquisitive head timidly around the corner of the stairs. The crash of\nglass had aroused him.\n\n\"What happened?\" he asked breathlessly.\n\n\"We don't know just yet,\" replied Mr. Grimm. \"If the noise aroused any\none else please assure them that there's nothing the matter. And you\nmight inform Madame Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur that the ambassador will return home\nto-morrow. Good night!\"\n\nAt his hotel, when he reached there, Mr. Grimm found Miss Thorne's\ncard--and he drew a long breath; at his office he found another of her\ncards, and he drew another long breath. He did like corroborative\ndetails, did Mr. Grimm, and, of course, this--! On the following day\nMiss Thorne accompanied him to Alexandria, and they were driven in a\nclosed carriage out toward the western edge of the city. Finally the\ncarriage stopped at a signal from Mr. Grimm, and he assisted Miss Thorne\nout, after which he turned and spoke to some one remaining inside--a\nman.\n\n\"The house is two blocks west, along that street there,\" he explained,\nand he indicated an intersecting thoroughfare just ahead. \"It is number\nninety-seven. Five minutes after we enter you will drive up in front of\nthe door and wait. If we don't return in fifteen minutes--come in after\nus!\"\n\n\"Do you anticipate danger?\" Miss Thorne queried quickly.\n\n\"If I had anticipated danger,\" replied Mr. Grimm, \"I should not have\npermitted you to come with me.\"\n\nThey entered the house--number ninety-seven--with a key which Mr. Grimm\nproduced, and a minute or so later walked into a room where three men\nwere sitting. One of them was of a coarse, repulsive type, large and\nheavy; another rather dapper, of superficial polish, evidently a\nforeigner, and the third--the third was Ambassador Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur!\n\n\"Good morning, gentlemen!\" Mr. Grimm greeted them, then ceremoniously:\n\"Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, your carriage is at the door.\"\n\nThe three men came to their feet instantly, and one of them--he of the\nheavy face--drew a revolver. Mr. Grimm faced him placidly.\n\n\"Do you know what would happen to you if you killed me?\" he inquired\npleasantly. \"You wouldn't live three minutes. Do you imagine I came in\nhere blindly? There are a dozen men guarding the entrances to the\nhouse--a pistol shot would bring them in. Put down the gun!\"\n\nEyes challenged eyes for one long tense instant, and the man carefully\nlaid the weapon on the table. Mr. Grimm strolled over and picked it up,\nafter which he glanced inquiringly at the other man--the ambassador's\nsecond guard.\n\n\"And you are the gentleman, I dare say, who made the necessary trips to\nthe ambassador's house, probably using his latch-key?\" he remarked\ninterrogatively. \"First for the letters to be signed, and again for the\ncigarettes?\"\n\nThere was no answer and Mr. Grimm turned questioningly to Monsieur\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, silent, white of face, motionless.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur,\" the ambassador burst out suddenly. His eyes were fixed\nunwaveringly on Miss Thorne.\n\n\"And your escape, Monsieur?\" continued Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"I did escape, Monsieur, last night,\" the ambassador explained, \"but\nthey knew it immediately--they pursued me into my own house, these two\nand another--and dragged me back here! _Mon Dieu, Monsieur, c'est--!_\"\n\n\"That's all that's necessary,\" remarked Mr. Grimm. \"You are free to go\nnow.\"\n\n\"But there are others,\" Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur interposed desperately, \"two\nmore somewhere below, and they will not allow--they will attack--!\"\n\nMr. Grimm's listless eyes narrowed slightly and he turned to Miss\nThorne. She was a little white, but he saw enough in her face to satisfy\nhim.\n\n\"I shall escort Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur to his carriage, Miss Thorne,\" he\nsaid calmly. \"These men will remain here until I return. Take the\nrevolver. If either of them so much as wags his head--_shoot_! You are\nnot--not afraid?\"\n\n\"No.\" She smiled faintly. \"I am not afraid.\"\n\nMr. Grimm and the ambassador went down the stairs, and out the front\ndoor. Mr. Grimm was just turning to reenter the house when from above\ncame a muffled, venomous cra-as-ash!--a shot! He took the steps going\nup, two at a time. Miss Thorne was leaning against the wall as if dazed;\nthe revolver lay at her feet. A door in a far corner of the room stood\nopen; and the clatter of footsteps echoed through the house.\n\n\"One of them leaped at me and I fired,\" she gasped in explanation. \"He\nstruck me, but I'm--I'm not hurt.\"\n\nShe stooped quickly, picked up the revolver and made as if to follow the\ndying footsteps. Mr. Grimm stopped her.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said quietly. \"Let them go.\" And after a while,\nearnestly: \"If I had dreamed of such a--such a thing as this I should\nnever have consented to allow you--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" she interrupted, and for one instant her outstretched\nhand rested on his arm. \"The ambassador?\"\n\n\"Perfectly safe,\" responded Mr. Grimm. \"Two of my men are with him.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nMASTER OF THE SITUATION\n\n\nAs the women rose and started out, leaving the gentlemen over their\ncoffee and cigars, Miss Thorne paused at the door and the blue-gray eyes\nflashed some subtle message to the French ambassador who, after an\ninstant, nodded comprehendingly, then resumed his conversation. As he\nleft the room a few minutes later he noticed that Mr. Grimm had joined a\ngroup of automaniacs of which Mr. Cadwallader was the enthusiastic\ncenter. He spoke to his hostess, the wife of the minister from Portugal,\nfor a moment, then went to Miss Thorne and dropped into a seat beside\nher. She greeted him with a smile and was still smiling as she talked.\n\n\"I believe, Monsieur,\" she said in French, \"you sent a code message to\nthe cable office this afternoon?\"\n\nHis eyes questioned hers quickly.\n\n\"And please bear in mind that we probably are being watched as we talk,\"\nshe went on pleasantly. \"Mr. Grimm is the man to be afraid of.\nSmile--don't look so serious!\" She laughed outright.\n\n\"Yes, I sent a code message,\" he replied.\n\n\"It was your resignation?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, it wasn't sent, of course,\" she informed him, and her eyes were\nsparkling as if something amusing had been said. \"One of my agents\nstopped it. I may add that it will not be sent.\"\n\nThe ambassador's eyes grew steely, then blank again.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, what am I to understand from that?\" he demanded.\n\n\"You are to understand that I am absolute master of the situation in\nWashington at this moment,\" she replied positively. The smile on her\nlips and the tone of her voice were strangely at variance. \"From the\nbeginning I let you understand that ultimately you would receive your\ninstructions from Paris; now I know they will reach you by cable\nto-morrow. Within a week the compact will be signed. Whether you approve\nof it or not it will be signed for your country by a special envoy whose\nauthority is greater than yours--his Highness, the Prince Benedetto\nd'Abruzzi.\"\n\n\"Has he reached Washington?\"\n\n\"He is in Washington. He has been here for some time, incognito.\" She\nwas silent a moment. \"You have been a source of danger to our plans,\"\nshe added. \"If it had not been for an accident you would still have been\ncomfortably kept out in Alexandria where Mr. Grimm and I found you.\nPlease remember, Monsieur, that we will accomplish what we set out to\ndo. Nothing can stop us--nothing.\"\n\nAt just about the same moment the name of Prince d'Abruzzi had been used\nin the dining-room, but in a different connection. Mr. Cadwallader was\nreciting some incident of an automobile trip in Italy when he had been\nconnected with the British embassy there.\n\n\"The prince was driving,\" he said, \"and one of the best I ever saw.\nCorking chap, the prince; democratic, you know, and all that sort of\nthing. He was one scion of royalty who didn't mind soiling his hands by\ndiving in under a car and fixing it himself. At that time he was\ninclined to be wild--that was eight or nine years ago--but they say now\nhe has settled down to work, and is one of the real diplomatic powers of\nItaly. I haven't seen him for a half dozen years.\"\n\n\"How old a man is he?\" asked Mr. Grimm carelessly.\n\n\"Thirty-five, thirty-eight, perhaps; I don't know,\" replied Mr.\nCadwallader. \"It's odd, you know, the number of princes and blue-bloods\nand all that sort of thing one can find knocking about in Italy and\nGermany and Spain. One never hears of half of them. I never had heard\nof the Prince d'Abruzzi until I went to Italy, and I've heard jolly well\nlittle of him since, except indirectly.\"\n\nMr. Cadwallader lapsed into silence as he sat staring at a large group\nphotograph which was framed on a wall of the dining-room.\n\n\"Isn't that the royal family of Italy?\" he asked. He rose and went over\nto it. \"By Jove, it is, and here is the prince in the group. The picture\nwas taken, I should say, about the time I knew him.\"\n\nMr. Grimm strolled over idly and stood for a long time staring at the\nphotograph.\n\n\"He can drive a motor, you know,\" said Mr. Cadwallader admiringly. \"And\nItaly is the place to drive them. They forgot to make any speed laws\nover there, and if a chap gets in your way and you knock him silly they\narrest him for obstructing traffic, you know. Over here if a chap really\nstarts to go any place in a hurry some bally idiot holds him up.\"\n\n\"Have you ever been held up?\" queried Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"No, but I expect to be every day,\" was the reply. \"I've got a new\nmotor, you know, and I've never been able to see how fast it is. The\nother evening I ran up to Baltimore with it in an hour and thirty-seven\nminutes from Alexandria to Druid Hill Park, and that's better than forty\nmiles. I never did let the motor out, you know, because we ran in the\ndark most of the way.\"\n\nMr. Grimm was still gazing at the photograph.\n\n\"Did you go alone?\" he asked.\n\n\"There's no fun motoring alone, you know. Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez was with\nme. Charming girl, what?\"\n\nA little while later Mr. Grimm sauntered out into the drawing-room and\nmade his way toward Miss Thorne and the French ambassador. Monsieur\nBoiss\u00c3\u00a9gur rose, and offered his hand cordially.\n\n\"I hope, Monsieur,\" said Mr. Grimm, \"that you are no worse off for\nyour--your unpleasant experience?\"\n\n\"Not at all, thanks to you,\" was the reply. \"I have just thanked Miss\nThorne for her part in the affair, and--\"\n\n\"I'm glad to have been of service,\" interrupted Mr. Grimm lightly.\n\nThe ambassador bowed ceremoniously and moved away. Mr. Grimm dropped\ninto the seat he had just left.\n\n\"You've left the legation, haven't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"You drove me out,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Drove you out?\" he repeated. \"Drove you out?\"\n\n\"Why, it was not only uncomfortable, but it was rather conspicuous\nbecause of the constant espionage of your Mr. Blair and your Mr. Johnson\nand your Mr. Hastings,\" she explained, still laughing. \"So I have moved\nto the Hotel Hilliard.\"\n\nMr. Grimm was twisting the seal ring on his little finger.\n\n\"I'm sorry if I've made it uncomfortable for you,\" he apologized. \"You\nsee it's necessary to--\"\n\n\"No explanation,\" Miss Thorne interrupted. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you do,\" he replied seriously. \"How long do you intend to\nremain in the city?\"\n\n\"Really I don't know--two, three, four weeks, perhaps. Why?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering.\"\n\nSe\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez came toward them.\n\n\"We're going to play bridge,\" she said, \"and we need you, Isabel, to\nmake the four. Come. I hate to take her away, Mr. Grimm.\"\n\nMr. Grimm and Miss Thorne rose together. For an instant her slim white\nhand rested on Mr. Grimm's sleeve and she stared into his eyes\nunderstandingly with a little of melancholy in her own. They left Mr.\nGrimm there.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nLETTERS FROM JAIL\n\n\nFor two weeks Signor Pietro Petrozinni, known to the Secret Service as\nan unaccredited agent of the Italian government, and the self-confessed\nassailant of Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez of the Mexican legation, had been taking his\nease in a cell. He had been formally arraigned and committed without\nbail to await the result of the bullet wound which had been inflicted\nupon the diplomatist from Mexico at the German Embassy Ball, and, since\nthen, undisturbed and apparently careless of the outcome, he had spent\nhis time in reading and smoking. He had answered questions with only a\ncurt yes or no when he deigned to answer them at all; and there had been\nno callers or inquiries for him. He had abruptly declined a suggestion\nof counsel.\n\nTwice each day, morning and night, he had asked a question of the\njailer who brought his simple meals.\n\n\"How is Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez?\"\n\n\"He is still in a critical condition.\" The answer was always the same.\n\nWhereupon the secret agent would return to his reading with not a shadow\nof uneasiness or concern on his face.\n\nOccasionally there came a courteous little note from Miss Thorne, which\nhe read without emotion, afterward casting them aside or tearing them\nup. He never answered them. And then one day there came another note\nwhich, for no apparent reason, seemed to stir him from his lethargy.\nOutwardly it was like all the others, but when Signor Petrozinni scanned\nthe sheet his eyes lighted strangely, and he stood staring down at it as\nthough to hide a sudden change of expression in his face. His gaze was\nconcentrated on two small splotches of ink where, it seemed, the pen\nhad scratched as Miss Thorne signed her name.\n\nThe guard stood at the barred door for a moment, then started to turn\naway. The prisoner stopped him with a quick gesture.\n\n\"Oh, Guard, may I have a glass of milk, please?\" he asked. \"No ice. I\nprefer it tepid.\"\n\nHe thrust a small coin between the bars; the guard accepted it and\npassed on. Then, still standing at the door, the prisoner read the note\nagain:\n\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND:\n\n\"I understand, from an indirect source, that there has been a marked\nimprovement in Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez's condition, and I am hastening to send you\nthe good news. There is every hope that within a short while, if he\ncontinues to improve, we can arrange a bail bond, and you will be free\nuntil the time of trial anyway.\n\n\"Might it not be well for you to consult an attorney at once? Drop me a\nline to let me know you received this.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\n\"ISABEL THORNE.\"\n\nFinally the prisoner tossed the note on a tiny table in a corner of his\ncell, and resumed his reading. After a time the guard returned with the\nmilk.\n\n\"Would it be against the rules for me to write an answer to this?\"\nqueried Signor Petrozinni, and he indicated the note.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" was the reply.\n\n\"If I might trouble you, then, for pen and ink and paper?\" suggested the\nsignor and he smiled a little. \"Believe me, I would prefer to get them\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"I guess that's right,\" the guard grinned good-naturedly.\n\nAgain he went away and the prisoner sat thoughtfully sipping the milk.\nHe took half of it, then lighted a cigarette, puffed it once or twice\nand permitted the light to die. After a little there came again the\nclatter of the guard's feet on the cement pavement, and the writing\nmaterials were thrust through the bars.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the prisoner.\n\nThe guard went on, with a nod, and a moment later the signor heard the\nclangor of a steel door down the corridor as it was closed and locked.\nHe leaned forward in his chair with half-closed eyes, listening for a\nlong time, then rose and noiselessly approached the cell door. Again he\nlistened intently, after which he resumed his seat. He tossed away the\ncigarette he had and lighted a fresh one, afterward holding the note\nover the flame of the match. Here and there, where the paper charred in\nthe heat, a letter or word stood out from the bare whiteness of the\npaper, and finally, a message complete appeared between the innocuous\nink-written lines. The prisoner read it greedily:\n\n\"Am privately informed there is little chance of Alvarez's recovery.\nShall I arrange escape for you, or have ambassador intercede? Would\nadvise former, as the other might take months, and meeting to sign\ntreaty alliance would be dangerously delayed.\"\n\nSignor Petrozinni permitted the sputtering flame to ignite the paper,\nand thoughtfully watched the blaze destroy it. The last tiny scrap\ndropped on the floor, burned out, and he crushed the ashes under his\nheel. Then he began to write:\n\n\"My Dear Miss Thorne:\n\n\"Many thanks for your courteous little note. I am delighted to know of\nthe improvement in Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez's condition. I had hoped that my\nimpulsive act in shooting him would not end in a tragedy. Please keep me\ninformed of any further change in his condition. As yet I do not see the\nnecessity of consulting an attorney, but later I may be compelled to do\nso.\n\n\"Respectfully,\n\n\"Pietro Petrozinni.\"\n\nThis done the secret agent carefully cleaned the ink from the pen,\nwiping it dry with his handkerchief, then thrust it into the half empty\nglass of milk. The fluid clung to the steel nib thinly; he went on\nwriting with it, between the lines of ink:\n\n\"I am in no danger. I hold credentials to United States, which, when\npresented, will make me responsible only to the Italian government as\nspecial envoy, according to international law. Arrange escape for one\nweek from to-night; use any money necessary. Make careful arrangements\nfor the test and signing of compact for two nights after.\"\n\nAgain the prisoner cleaned the steel nib, after which he put it back in\nthe bottle of ink, leaving it there. He waved the sheet of paper back\nand forth to dry it, and at last scrutinized it minutely, standing under\nthe light from the high-up window of his cell. Letter by letter the milk\nevaporated, leaving the sheet perfectly clean and white except for the\nink-written message. This sheet he folded, placed in an envelope, and\naddressed.\n\nLater the guard passed along the corridor, and Signor Petrozinni thrust\nthe letter out to him.\n\n\"Be good enough to post that, please,\" he requested. \"It isn't sealed. I\ndon't know if your prison rules require you to read the letters that go\nout. If so, read it, or have it read, then seal it.\"\n\nFor answer the guard dampened the flap of the envelope, sealed it,\nthrust it into his pocket and passed on. The secret agent sat down\nagain, and sipped his milk meditatively.\n\nOne hour later Mr. Grimm, accompanied by Johnson, came out of a\nphotographer's dark room in Pennsylvania Avenue with a developed\nnegative which he set on a rack to dry. At the end of another hour he\nwas sitting at his desk studying, under a magnifying glass, a finished\nprint of the negative. Word by word he was writing on a slip of paper\nwhat his magnifying glass gave him and so, curiously enough, it came to\npass that Miss Thorne and Chief Campbell of the Secret Service were\nreading the hidden, milk-written message at almost the identical moment.\n\n\"Johnson got Petrozinni's letter from the postman,\" Mr. Grimm was\nexplaining. \"I opened it, photographed it, sealed it again and remailed\nit. There was not more than half an hour's delay; and Miss Thorne can\nnot possibly know of it.\" He paused a moment. \"It's an odd thing that\nwriting such as that is absolutely invisible to the naked eye, and yet\nwhen photographed becomes decipherable in the negative.\"\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" Mr. Campbell asked. The guileless blue eyes\nwere alive with eagerness.\n\n\"Well, he's right, of course, about not being in danger,\" said Mr.\nGrimm. \"If he came with credentials as special envoy this government\nmust respect them, even if Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez dies, and leave it to his own\ngovernment to punish him. If we were officially aware that he has such\ncredentials I doubt if we would have the right to keep him confined; we\nwould merely have to hand him over to the Italian embassy and demand his\npunishment. And, of course, all that makes him more dangerous than\never.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that,\" said the chief a little impatiently. \"But who is\nthis man?\"\n\n\"Who is this man?\" Mr. Grimm repeated as if surprised at the question.\n\"I was looking for Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi, of Italy. I have found\nhim.\"\n\nMr. Campbell's clock-like brain ticked over the situation in detail.\n\n\"It's like this,\" Mr. Grimm elucidated. \"He has credentials which he\nknows will free him if he is forced to present them, but I imagine they\nwere given to him more for protection in an emergency like this than for\nintroducing him to our government. As the matter stands he can't afford\nto discover himself by using those credentials, and yet, if the Latin\ncompact is signed, he must be free. Remember, too, that he is accredited\nfrom three countries--Italy, France and Spain.\" He was silent for a\nmoment. \"Naturally his escape from prison would preserve his incognito,\nand at the same time permit him to sign the compact.\"\n\nThere was silence for a long time.\n\n\"I believe the situation is without precedent,\" said Mr. Campbell\nslowly. \"The special envoy of three great powers held for attempted--!\"\n\n\"Officially we are not aware of his purpose, or his identity,\" Mr. Grimm\nreminded him. \"If he escaped it would clarify the situation\ntremendously.\"\n\n\"If he escaped!\" repeated Mr. Campbell musingly.\n\n\"But, of course, the compact would not be signed, at least in this\ncountry,\" Mr. Grimm went on tentatively.\n\nMr. Campbell gazed straight into the listless eyes of the young man for\na minute or more, and gradually full understanding came home to him.\nFinally he nodded his head.\n\n\"Use your own judgment, Mr. Grimm,\" he directed.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nA CALL ON THE WARDEN\n\n\nThe restful silence of night lay over the great prison. Here and there\nin the grim corridors a guard dozed in the glare of an electric light;\nand in the office, too, a desk light glimmered where the warden sat at\nhis desk, poring over a report. Once he glanced up at the clock--it was\nfive minutes of eleven--and then he went on with his reading.\n\nAfter a little the silence was broken by the whir of the clock and the\nfirst sharp stroke of the hour; and at just that moment the door from\nthe street opened and a man entered. He was rather tall and slender, and\na sinister black mask hid his face from the quickly raised eyes of the\nwarden. For a bare fraction of a second the two men stared at each\nother, then, instinctively, the warden's right hand moved toward the\nopen drawer of his desk where a revolver lay, and his left toward\nseveral electrically connected levers. The intruder noted both gestures,\nand, unarmed himself, stood silent. The warden was first to speak.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"You have a prisoner here, Pietro Petrozinni,\" was the reply, in a\npleasant voice. \"I have come to demand his release.\"\n\nThe warden's right hand was raised above the desk top, and the revolver\nin it clicked warningly.\n\n\"You have come to demand his release, eh?\" he queried. He still sat\nmotionless, with his eyes fixed on the black mask. \"How did you pass the\noutside guard?\"\n\n\"He was bribed,\" was the ready response. \"Now, Warden,\" the masked\nintruder continued pacifically, \"it would be much more pleasant all\naround and there would be less personal danger in it for both of us if\nyou would release Signor Petrozinni without question. I may add that no\nbribe was offered to you because your integrity was beyond question.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the warden grimly, \"and it shall remain so as long as\nI have this.\" He tapped on the desk with the revolver.\n\n\"Oh, that isn't loaded,\" said the masked man quietly.\n\nOne quick glance at the weapon showed the warden that the cartridges had\nbeen drawn! His teeth closed with a snap at the treachery of it, and\nwith his left hand he pulled back one of the levers--that which should\narouse the jailers, turnkeys and guards. Instead of the insistent\nclangor which he expected, there was silence.\n\n\"That wire has been cut,\" the stranger volunteered.\n\nWith clenched teeth the warden pulled the police alarm.\n\n\"And that wire was cut, too,\" the stranger explained.\n\nThe warden came to his feet with white face, and nails biting into the\npalms of his hands. He still held the revolver as he advanced upon the\nmasked man threateningly.\n\n\"Not too close, now,\" warned the intruder, with a sudden hardening of\nhis voice. \"Believe me, it would be best for you to release this man,\nbecause it must be done, pleasantly or otherwise. I have no desire to\ninjure you, still less do I intend that you shall injure me; and it\nwould be needless for either of us to make a personal matter of it. I\nwant your prisoner, Signor Petrozinni--you will release him at once!\nThat's all!\"\n\nThe warden paused, dazed, incredulous before the audacity of it, while\nhe studied two calm eyes which peered at him through the slits of the\nmask.\n\n\"And if I _don't_ release him?\" he demanded at last, fiercely.\n\n\"Then I shall take him,\" was the reply. \"It has been made impossible for\nyou to give an alarm,\" the stranger went on. \"The very men on whom you\nmost depended have been bought, and even if they were within sound of\nyour voice now they wouldn't respond. One of your assistants who has\nbeen here for years unloaded the revolver in the desk there, and less\nthan an hour ago cut the prison alarm wire. I, personally, cut the\npolice alarm outside the building. So you see!\"\n\nAs yet there was no weapon in sight, save the unloaded revolver in the\nwarden's hand; at no time had the stranger's voice been raised. His tone\nwas a perfectly normal one.\n\n\"Besides yourself there are only five other men employed here who are\nnow awake,\" the masked man continued. \"These are four inner guards and\nthe outer guard. They have all been bought--the turnkeys at five\nthousand dollars each, and the outer guard at seven thousand. The\nreceipt of all of this money is conditional upon the release of Signor\nPetrozinni, therefore it is to their interest to aid me as against you.\nI am telling you all this, frankly and fully, to make you see how\nfutile any resistance would be.\"\n\n\"But who--who is this Signor Petrozinni, that such powerful influences\nshould be brought to bear in his behalf?\" demanded the bewildered\nwarden.\n\n\"He is a man who can command a vast fortune--and Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez is at the\npoint of death. That, I think, makes it clear. Now, if you'll sit down,\nplease!\"\n\n\"Sit down?\" bellowed the warden.\n\nSuddenly he was seized by a violent, maddening rage. He took one step\nforward and raised the empty revolver to strike. The masked man moved\nslightly to one side and his clenched fist caught the warden on the\npoint of the chin. The official went down without a sound and lay still,\ninert. A moment later the door leading into the corridor of the prison\nopened, and Signor Petrozinni, accompanied by one of the guards, entered\nthe warden's office. The masked man glanced around at them, and with a\nmotion of his head indicated the door leading to the street. They\npassed through, closing the door behind them.\n\nFor a little time the intruder stood staring down at the still body,\nthen he went to the telephone and called police headquarters.\n\n\"There has been a jail delivery at the prison,\" he said in answer to the\n\"hello\" of the desk-sergeant at the other end of the wire. \"Better send\nsome of your men up to investigate.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" came the answering question.\n\nThe stranger replaced the receiver on the hook, stripped off his black\nmask, dropped it on the floor beside the motionless warden, and went\nout. It was Mr. Grimm!\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nNOTICE TO LEAVE\n\n\nAt fifteen minutes of midnight when Miss Thorne, followed by Signor\nPetrozinni, entered the sitting-room of her apartments in the hotel and\nturned up the light they found Mr. Grimm already there. He rose\ncourteously. At sight of him Miss Thorne's face went deathly white, and\nthe escaped prisoner turned toward the door again.\n\n\"I would advise that you stay, your Highness,\" said Mr. Grimm coldly.\nSignor Petrozinni paused, amazed. \"You will merely subject yourself to\nthe humiliation of arrest if you attempt to leave. The house is guarded\nby a dozen men.\"\n\n\"Your Highness?\" Miss Thorne repeated blankly. \"You are assuming a\ngreat deal, aren't you, Mr. Grimm?\"\n\n\"I don't believe,\" and Mr. Grimm's listless eyes were fixed on those of\nthe escaped prisoner, \"I don't believe that Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi\nwill deny his identity?\"\n\nThere was one of those long tense silences when eye challenges eye, when\nwit is pitted against wit, and mind is hauled around to a new, and\nsometimes unattractive, view of a situation. Miss Thorne stood silent\nwith rigid features, colorless as marble; but slowly a sneer settled\nabout the lips of Signor Petrozinni that was, and he sat down.\n\n[Illustration: A long tense silence when eye challenges eye.]\n\n\"You seem to know everything, Mr. Grimm,\" he taunted.\n\n\"I _try_ to know everything, your Highness,\" was the reply. Mr. Grimm\nwas still standing. \"I know, for instance, that one week ago the plot\nwhich had your freedom for its purpose was born; I know the contents of\nevery letter that passed between you and Miss Thorne here,\nnotwithstanding the invisible ink; I know that four days ago several\nthousand dollars was smuggled in to you concealed in a basket of fruit;\nI know, with that money, you bribed your way out, while Miss Thorne or\none of her agents bribed the guard in front; I know that the escape was\nplanned for to-night, and that the man who was delegated to take charge\nof it is now locked in my office under guard. It may interest you to\nknow that it was I who took his place and made the escape possible. I\nknow that much!\"\n\n\"You--_you_--!\" the prince burst out suddenly. \"_You_ aided me to\nescape?\"\n\nMiss Thorne was staring, staring at them with her eyes widely distended,\nand her red lips slightly parted.\n\n\"_Why_ did you assist him?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Details are tiresome, Miss Thorne,\" replied Mr. Grimm with the utmost\ncourtesy. \"There is one other thing I know--that the Latin compact will\nnot be signed in the United States.\"\n\nThe prince's eyes met Miss Thorne's inquiringly, and she shook her\nhead. The sneer was still playing about his mouth.\n\n\"Anything else of special interest that you know?\" he queried.\n\n\"Yes, of interest to both you and Miss Thorne. That is merely if the\nLatin compact is signed anywhere, the English-speaking countries of the\nworld might construe it as a _casus belli_ and strike soon enough, and\nhard enough, to put an end to it once for all.\"\n\nAgain there was silence for a little while. Slowly the prince's eyes\nwere darkening, and a shadow flitted across Miss Thorne's face. The\nprince rose impatiently.\n\n\"Well, what is the meaning of all this? Are you going to take me back to\nprison?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Grimm. He glanced at his watch. \"I will give each of you\none-half hour to pack your belongings. We must catch a train at one\no'clock.\"\n\n\"Leave the city?\" gasped Miss Thorne.\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the prince.\n\n\"One-half hour,\" said Mr. Grimm coldly.\n\n\"But--but it's out of the question,\" expostulated Miss Thorne.\n\n\"One-half hour,\" repeated Mr. Grimm. He didn't dare to meet those\nwonderful blue-gray eyes now. \"A special car with private compartments\nwill be attached to the regular train, and the only inconvenience to you\nwill be the fact that the three of us will be compelled to sit up all\nnight. Half a dozen other Secret Service men will be on the train with\nus.\"\n\nAnd then the prince's entire manner underwent a change.\n\n\"Mr. Grimm,\" he said earnestly, \"it is absolutely necessary that I\nremain in Washington for another week--remain here even if I am locked\nup again--lock me up again if you like. I can't sign compacts in\nprison.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five minutes,\" replied Mr. Grimm quietly.\n\n\"But here,\" exclaimed the prince explosively, \"I have credentials which\nwill insure my protection in spite of your laws.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" said Mr. Grimm placidly. \"Credentials of that nature can\nnot be presented at midnight, and you will not be here to-morrow to\npresent them. The fact that you have those credentials, your Highness,\nis one reason why you must leave Washington now, to-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nBY WIRELESS\n\n\nThey paused in the office, the three of them, and while Miss Thorne was\ngiving some instructions as to her baggage the prince went over to the\ntelegraph booth and began to write a message on a blank. Mr. Grimm\nappeared at his elbow.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"Can't I send a telegram if I like?\" demanded the prince sharply.\n\n\"No, nor a note, nor a letter, nor may you speak to any one,\" Mr. Grimm\ninformed him quietly.\n\n\"Why, it's an outrage!\" flamed the prince.\n\n\"It depends altogether on the view-point, your Highness,\" said Mr. Grimm\ncourteously. \"If you will pardon me I might suggest that it is needless\nto attract attention by your present attitude. You may--I say you\n_may_--compel me to humiliate you.\" The prince glared at him angrily. \"I\nmean handcuff you,\" Mr. Grimm added gratuitously.\n\n\"Handcuff _me_?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't hesitate, your Highness, if it was necessary.\"\n\nAfter a moment Miss Thorne signified her readiness, and they started\nout. At the door Mr. Grimm stopped and turned back to the desk, as if\nstruck by some sudden thought, leaving them together.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Thorne left a message for some one,\" Mr. Grimm was saying to\nthe clerk. \"She's decided it is unnecessary.\" He turned and glanced\ntoward her, and the clerk's eyes followed his. \"Please give it to me.\"\n\nIt was passed over without comment. It was a sealed envelope addressed\nto Mr. Charles Winthrop Rankin. Mr. Grimm glanced at the superscription,\ntore the envelope into bits and dropped it into a basket. A minute\nlater he was assisting Miss Thorne and the prince into an automobile\nthat was waiting in front. As the car moved away two other automobiles\nappeared from corners near-by and trailed along behind to the station.\nThere a private compartment-car was in readiness for them.\n\nIt was a long, dreary ride--a ride of utter silence save for the roar\nand clatter of the moving train. Mr. Grimm, vigilant, implacable, sat at\nease; Miss Thorne, resigned to the inevitable, whatever it might be,\nstudied the calm, quiet face from beneath drooping lids; and the prince,\nsullen, scowling, nervously wriggled in his seat. Philadelphia was\npassed, and Trenton, and then the dawn began to break through the night.\nIt was quite light when they rolled into Jersey City.\n\n\"I'm sorry for all the inconvenience I have caused,\" Mr. Grimm\napologized to Miss Thorne as he assisted her to alight. \"You must be\nexhausted.\"\n\n\"If it were only that!\" she replied, with a slight smile. \"And is it\ntoo early to ask where we are going?\"\n\nThe prince turned quickly at the question.\n\n\"We take the _Lusitania_ for Liverpool at ten o'clock,\" said Mr. Grimm\nobligingly. \"Meanwhile let's get some coffee and a bite to eat.\"\n\n\"Are you going to make the trip with us?\" asked the prince.\n\nMr. Grimm shrugged his shoulders.\n\nWeary and spiritless they went aboard the boat, and a little while later\nthey steamed out into the stream and threaded their way down the bay.\nMiss Thorne stood at the rail gazing back upon the city they were\nleaving. Mr. Grimm stood beside her; the prince, still sullen, still\nscowling, sat a dozen feet away.\n\n\"This is a wonderful thing you have done, Mr. Grimm,\" said Miss Thorne\nat last.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said simply. \"It was a destructive thing that you\nintended to do. Did you ever see a more marvelous thing than that?\" and\nhe indicated the sky-line of New York. \"It's the most marvelous bit of\nmechanism in the world; the dynamo of the western hemisphere. You would\nhave destroyed it, because in the world-war that would have been the\nfirst point of attack.\"\n\nShe raised her eyebrows, but was silent.\n\n\"Somehow,\" he went on after a moment, \"I could never associate a woman\nwith destructiveness, with wars and with violence.\"\n\n\"That is an unjust way of saying it,\" she interposed. And then,\nmusingly: \"Isn't it odd that you and I--standing here by the rail--have,\nin a way, held the destinies of the whole great earth in our hands? And\nnow your remark makes me feel that you alone have stood for peace and\nthe general good, and I for destruction and evil.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that,\" Mr. Grimm said quickly. \"You have done your duty\nas you saw it, and--\"\n\n\"Failed!\" she interrupted.\n\n\"And I have done my duty as I saw it.\"\n\n\"And won!\" she added. She smiled a little sadly. \"I think, perhaps you\nand I might have been excellent friends if it had not been for all\nthis.\"\n\n\"I know we should have,\" said Mr. Grimm, almost eagerly. \"I wonder if\nyou will ever forgive me for--for--?\"\n\n\"Forgive you?\" she repeated. \"There is nothing to forgive. One must do\none's duty. But I wish it could have been otherwise.\"\n\nThe Statue of Liberty slid by, and Governor's Island and Fort Hamilton;\nthen, in the distance, Sandy Hook light came into view.\n\n\"I'm going to leave you here,\" said Mr. Grimm, and for the first time\nthere was a tense, strained note in his voice.\n\nMiss Thorne's blue-gray eyes had grown mistily thoughtful; the words\nstartled her a little and she turned to face him.\n\n\"It may be that you and I shall never meet again,\" Mr. Grimm went on.\n\n\"We _will_ meet again,\" she said gravely. \"When and where I don't know,\nbut it will come.\"\n\n\"And perhaps then we may be friends?\" He was pleading now.\n\n\"Why, we are friends now, aren't we?\" she asked, and again the smile\ncurled her scarlet lips. \"Surely we are friends, aren't we?\"\n\n\"We are,\" he declared positively.\n\nAs they started forward a revenue cutter which had been hovering about\nSandy Hook put toward them, flying some signal at her masthead. Slowly\nthe great boat on which they stood crept along, then the clang of a bell\nin the engine-room brought her to a standstill, and the revenue cutter\ncame alongside.\n\n\"I leave you here,\" Mr. Grimm said again. \"It's good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" she said softly. \"Good-by, till we meet once more.\"\n\nShe extended both hands impulsively and he stood for an instant staring\ninto the limpid gray eyes, then, turning, went below. From the revenue\ncutter he waved a hand at her as the great _Lusitania_, moving again,\nsped on her way. The prince joined Miss Thorne at the rail. The scowl\nwas still on his face.\n\n\"And now what?\" he demanded abruptly. \"This man has treated us as if we\nwere a pair of children.\"\n\n\"He's a wonderful man,\" she replied.\n\n\"That may be--but we have been fools to allow him to do all this.\"\n\nMiss Thorne turned flatly and faced him.\n\n\"We are not beaten yet,\" she said slowly. \"If all things go well we--we\nare not beaten yet.\"\n\nThe _Lusitania_ was rounding Montauk Point when the wireless brought her\nto half-speed with a curt message:\n\n\"Isabel Thorne and Pietro Petrozinni aboard _Lusitania_ wanted on\nwarrants charging conspiracy. Tug-boat will take them off, intercepting\nyou beyond Montauk Point.\n\n\"CAMPBELL, Secret Service.\"\n\n\"What does _that_ mean?\" asked the prince, bewildered.\n\n\"It means that the compact will be signed in Washington in spite of Mr.\nGrimm,\" and there was the glitter of triumph in her eyes. \"With the aid\nof one of the maids in the depot at Jersey City I managed to get a\ntelegram of explanation and instruction to De Foe in New York, and this\nis the result. He signed Mr. Campbell's name, I suppose, to give weight\nto the message.\"\n\nAn hour later a tug-boat came alongside, and they went aboard.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nTHE LIGHT IN THE DOME\n\n\nFrom where he sat, in a tiny alcove which jutted out and encroached upon\nthe line of the sidewalk, Mr. Grimm looked down on Pennsylvania Avenue,\nthe central thread of Washington, ever changing, always brilliant,\nsplashed at regular intervals with light from high-flung electric arcs.\nThe early theater crowd was in the street, well dressed, well fed,\ncareless for the moment of all things save physical comfort and\namusement; automobiles, carriages, cabs, cars flowed past endlessly; and\nyet Mr. Grimm saw naught of it. In the distance, at one end of the\navenue the dome of the capitol cleft the shadows of night, and a single\nlight sparkled at its apex; in the other direction, at the left of the\ntreasury building which abruptly blocks the wide thoroughfare, were the\nshimmering windows of the White House.\n\nMotionless, moody, thoughtful, Mr. Grimm sat staring, staring straight\nahead, comprehending none of these things which lay before him as in a\npanorama. Instead, his memory was conjuring up a pair of subtle,\nblue-gray eyes, now pleading, now coquettish, now frankly defiant; two\nslim, white, wonderful hands; the echo of a pleasant, throaty laugh; a\nsplendid, elusive, radiant-haired phantom. Truly, a woman of mystery!\nWho was this Isabel Thorne who, for months past, had been the\nstorm-center and directing mind of a vast international intrigue which\nthreatened the world with war? Who, this remarkable young woman who with\nease and assurance commanded ambassadors and played nations as pawns?\n\nNow that she was safely out of the country Mr. Grimm had leisure to\nspeculate. Upon him had devolved the duty of blocking her plans, and he\nhad done so--merciless alike of his own feeling and of hers. Hesitation\nor evasion had never occurred to him. It was a thing to be done, and he\ndid it. He wondered if she had understood, there at the last beside the\nrail? He wondered if she knew the struggle it had cost him deliberately\nto send her out of his life? Or had even surmised that her expulsion\nfrom the country, by his direct act, was wholly lacking in the\nexaltation of triumph to him; that it struck deeper than that, below the\nlistless, official exterior, into his personal happiness? And wondering,\nhe knew that she _did_ understand.\n\nA silent shod waiter came and placed the coffee things at his elbow. He\ndidn't heed. The waiter poured a demi-tasse, and inquiringly lifted a\nlump of sugar in the silver tongs. Still Mr. Grimm didn't heed. At last\nthe waiter deposited the sugar on the edge of the fragile saucer, and\nmoved away as silently as he had come. A newspaper which Mr. Grimm had\nplaced on the end of the table when he sat down, rattled a little as a\nbreeze from the open window caught it, then the top sheet slid off and\nfell to the floor. Mr. Grimm was still staring out the window.\n\nSlowly the room behind him was thinning of its crowd as the\ntheater-bound diners went out in twos and threes. The last of these\ndisappeared finally, and save for Mr. Grimm there were not more than a\ndozen persons left in the place. Thus for a few minutes, and then the\nswinging doors leading from the street clicked, and a gentleman entered.\nHe glanced around, as if seeking a seat near a window, then moved along\nin Mr. Grimm's direction, between the rows of tables. His gaze lingered\non Mr. Grimm for an instant, and when he came opposite he stooped and\npicked up the fallen newspaper sheet.\n\n\"Your paper?\" he inquired courteously.\n\nMr. Grimm was still gazing dreamily out of the window.\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" insisted the new-comer pleasantly. He folded the paper\nonce and replaced it on the table. One hand lingered for just the\nfraction of a moment above Mr. Grimm's coffee-cup.\n\nAroused by the remark, Mr. Grimm glanced around.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" he apologized hastily. \"I didn't hear you at first.\nThank you.\"\n\nThe new-comer nodded, smiled and passed on, taking a seat two or three\ntables down.\n\nApparently this trifling courtesy had broken the spell of reverie, for\nMr. Grimm squared around to the table again, drew his coffee-cup toward\nhim, and dropped in the single lump of sugar. He idly stirred it for a\nmoment, as his eyes turned again toward the open window, then he lifted\nthe tiny cup and emptied it.\n\nAgain he sat motionless for a long time, and thrice the new-comer, only\na few feet away, glanced at him narrowly. And now, it seemed, a peculiar\ndrowsiness was overtaking Mr. Grimm. Once he caught himself nodding and\nraised his head with a jerk. Then he noticed that the arc lights in the\nstreet were wobbling curiously, and he fell to wondering why that\nsingle flame sparkled at the apex of the capitol dome. Things around him\ngrew hazy, vague, unreal, and then, as if realizing that something was\nthe matter with him, he came to his feet.\n\nHe took one step forward into the space between the tables, reeled,\nattempted to steady himself by holding on to a chair, then everything\ngrew black about him, and he pitched forward on the floor. His face was\ndead white; his fingers moved a little, nervously, weakly, then they\nwere still.\n\nSeveral people rose at the sound of the falling body, and the new-comer\nhurried forward. His coat sleeve caught the empty demi-tasse, as he\nstooped, and swept it to the floor, where it was shattered. The head\nwaiter and another came, pell-mell, and those diners who had risen came\nmore slowly.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the head waiter anxiously.\n\nAlready the new-comer was supporting Mr. Grimm on his knee, and\nflicking water in his face.\n\n\"Nothing serious, I fancy,\" he answered shortly. \"He's subject to these\nlittle attacks.\"\n\n\"What are they? Who is he?\"\n\nThe stranger tore at Mr. Grimm's collar until it came loose, then he\nfell to chafing the still hands.\n\n\"He is a Mr. Grimm, a government employee--I know him,\" he answered\nagain. \"I imagine it's nothing more serious than indigestion.\"\n\nA little knot had gathered about them, with offers of assistance.\n\n\"Waiter, hadn't you better send for a physician?\" some one suggested.\n\n\"I'm a physician,\" the stranger put in impatiently. \"Have some one call\na cab, and I'll see that he's taken home. It happens that we live in the\nsame apartment house, just a few blocks from here.\"\n\nObedient to the crisply-spoken directions, a cab was called, and five\nminutes later Mr. Grimm, still insensible, was lifted into it. The\nstranger took a seat beside him, the cabby touched his horse with a\nwhip, and the vehicle fell into the endless, moving line.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nA SLIP OF PAPER\n\n\nWhen the light of returning consciousness finally pierced the black\nlethargy that enshrouded him, Mr. Grimm's mind was a chaos of vagrant,\nabsurd fantasies; then slowly, slowly, realization struggled back to its\nown, and he came to know things. First was the knowledge that he was\nlying flat on his back, on a couch, it seemed; then, that he was in the\ndark--an utter, abject darkness. And finally came an overwhelming sense\nof silence.\n\nFor a while he lay motionless, with not even the movement of an eye-lash\nto indicate consciousness, wrapped in a delicious languor. Gradually\nthis passed and the feeble flutter of his heart grew into a steady,\nrhythmic beat. The keen brain was awakening; he was beginning to\nremember. What had happened? He knew only that in some manner a drug had\nbeen administered to him, a bitter dose tasting of opium; that\nspeechlessly, he had fought against it, that he had risen from the table\nin the restaurant, and that he had fallen. All the rest was blank.\n\nWith eyes still closed, and nerveless hands inert at his sides he\nlistened, the while he turned the situation over in speculative mood.\nThe waiter had administered the drug, of course, unless--unless it had\nbeen the courteous stranger who had replaced the newspaper on the table!\nThat thought opened new fields of conjecture. Mr. Grimm had no\nrecollection of ever having seen him before; and he had paid only the\nenforced attention of politeness to him. And why had the drug been\nadministered? Vaguely, incoherently, Mr. Grimm imagined that in some way\nit had to do with the great international plot of war in which Miss\nThorne was so delicate and vital an instrument.\n\nWhere was he? Conjecture stopped there. Evidently he was where the\ncourteous gentleman in the restaurant wanted him to be. A prisoner?\nProbably. In danger? Long, careful attention to detail work in the\nSecret Service had convinced Mr. Grimm that he was always in danger.\nThat was one reason--and the best--why he had lain motionless, without\nso much as lifting a finger, since that first glimmer of consciousness\nhad entered his brain. He was probably under scrutiny, even in the\ndarkness, and for the present it was desirable to accommodate any chance\nwatcher by remaining apparently unconscious.\n\nAnd so for a long time he lay, listening. Was there another person in\nthe room? Mr. Grimm's ears were keenly alive for the inadvertent\nshuffling of a foot; or the sound of breathing. Nothing. Even the night\nroar of the city was missing; the silence was oppressive. At last he\nopened his eyes. A pall of gloom encompassed him--a pall without one\nrift of light. His fingers, moving slowly, explored the limits of the\ncouch whereon he lay.\n\nConfident, at last, that wherever he was, he was unwatched, Mr. Grimm\nwas on the point of concluding that further inaction was useless, when\nhis straining ears caught the faint grating of metal against\nmetal--perhaps the insertion of a key in the lock. His hands grew still;\nhis eyes closed. And after a moment a door creaked slightly on its\nhinges, and a breath of cool air informed Mr. Grimm that that open door,\nwherever it was, led to the outside, and freedom.\n\nThere was another faint creaking as the door was shut. Mr. Grimm's\nnerveless hands closed involuntarily, and his lips were set together\ntightly. Was it to be a knife thrust in the dark? If not--then what? He\nexpected the flare of a match; instead there was a soft tread, and the\nrustle of skirts. A woman! Mr. Grimm's caution was all but forgotten in\nhis surprise. As the steps drew nearer his clenched fingers loosened; he\nwaited.\n\nTwo hands stretched forward in the dark, touched him\nsimultaneously--one on the face, one on the breast. A singular thrill\nshot through him, but there was not the flicker of an eye or the\ntwitching of a finger. The woman--it _was_ a woman--seemed now to be\nbending over him, then he heard her drop on her knees beside him, and\nshe pressed an inquiring ear to his left side. It was the heart test.\n\n\"Thank God!\" she breathed softly.\n\nIt was only by a masterful effort that Mr. Grimm held himself limp and\ninert, for a strange fragrance was enveloping him--a fragrance he well\nknew.\n\nThe hands were fumbling at his breast again, and there was the sharp\ncrackle of paper. At first he didn't understand, then he knew that the\nwoman had pinned a paper to the lapel of his coat. Finally she\nstraightened up, and took two steps away from him, after which came a\npause. His keenly attuned ears caught her faint breathing, then the\nrustle of her skirts as she turned back. She was leaning over him\nagain--her lips touched his forehead, barely; again there was a quick\nrustling of skirts, the door creaked, and--silence, deep, oppressive,\noverwhelming silence.\n\nIsabel! Was he dreaming? And then he ceased wondering and fell to\nremembering her kiss--light as air--and the softly spoken \"Thank God!\"\nShe did care, then! She _had_ understood, that day!\n\nThe kiss of a woman beloved is a splendid heart tonic. Mr. Grimm\nstraightened up suddenly on the couch, himself again. He touched the\nslip of paper which she had pinned to his coat to make sure it was not\nall a dream, after which he recalled the fact that while he had heard\nthe door creak before she went out he had not heard it creak afterward.\nTherefore, the door was open. She had left it open. Purposely? That was\nbeside the question at the moment.\n\nAnd why--how--was she in Washington? Pondering that question, Mr.\nGrimm's excellent teeth clicked sharply together and he rose. He knew\nthe answer. The compact was to be signed--the alliance which would array\nthe civilized world in arms. He had failed to block that, as he thought.\nIf Miss Thorne had returned, then Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi, who held\nabsolute power to sign the compact for Italy, France and Spain, had also\nreturned.\n\nStealthily, feeling his way as he went, Mr. Grimm moved toward the door\nleading to freedom, guided by the fresh draft of air. He reached the\ndoor--it was standing open--and a moment later stepped out into the\nstar-lit night. It was open country here, with a thread of white road\njust ahead, and farther along a fringe of shrubbery. Mr. Grimm reached\nthe road. Far down it, a pin point in the night, a light flickered\nthrough interlacing branches. The tail lamp of an automobile, of course!\n\nMr. Grimm left the road and skirted a sparse hedge in the direction of\nthe light. After a moment he heard the engine of an automobile, and saw\na woman--barely discernible--step into the car. As it started forward he\nstaked everything on one bold move, and won, his reward being a narrow\nsitting space in the rear of the car, hidden from its occupants by the\ntonneau. One mile, two miles, three miles they charged through the\nnight, and still he clung on. At last there came relief.\n\n\"That's the place, where the lights are--just ahead.\"\n\nThere was no mistaking that voice raised above the clamor of the engine.\nThe car slackened speed, and Mr. Grimm dropped off and darted behind\nsome convenient bushes. And the first thing he did there was to light a\nmatch, and read what was written on the slip of paper pinned to his\ncoat. It was, simply:\n\n\"My Dear Mr. Grimm:\n\n\"By the time you read this the compact will have been signed, and your\nefforts to prevent it, splendid as they were, futile. It is a tribute to\nyou that it was unanimously agreed that you must be accounted for at\nthe time of the signing, hence the drugging in the restaurant; it was\nonly an act of kindness that I should come here to see that all was well\nwith you, and leave the door open behind me.\n\n\"Believe me when I say that you are one man in whom I have never been\ndisappointed. Accept this as my farewell, for now I assume again the\nname and position rightfully mine. And know, too, that I shall always\ncherish the belief that you will remember me as\n\n\"Your friend,\n\n\"ISABEL THORNE.\n\n\"P. S. The prince and I left the steamer at Montauk Point, on a\ntug-boat.\"\n\nMr. Grimm kissed the note twice, then burned it.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nTHE COMPACT\n\n\nA room, low-ceilinged, dim, gloomy, sinister as an inquisition chamber;\na single large table in the center, holding a kerosene lamp, writing\nmaterials and a metal spheroid a shade larger than a one-pound shell;\nand around it a semicircle of silent, masked and cowled figures. There\nwere twelve of them, eleven men and a woman. In the shadows, which grew\ndenser at the far end of the room, was a squat, globular object, a\nmassive, smooth-sided, black, threatening thing of iron.\n\nOne of the men glanced at his watch--it was just two o'clock--then rose\nand took a position beside the table, facing the semicircle. He placed\nthe timepiece on the table in front of him.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, and there was the faintest trace of a foreign\naccent, \"I shall speak English because I know that whatever your\nnationality all of you are familiar with that tongue. And now an apology\nfor the theatric aspect of all this--the masks, the time and place of\nmeeting, and the rest of it.\" He paused a moment. \"There is only one\nperson living who knows the name and position of all of you,\" and by a\nsweep of his hand he indicated the motionless figure of the woman. \"It\nwas by her decision that masks are worn, for, while we all know the\ndetails of the Latin compact, there is a bare chance that some one will\nnot sign, and it is not desirable that the identity of that person be\nknown to all of us. The reason for the selection of this time and place\nis obvious, for an inkling of the proposed signing has reached the\nSecret Service. I will add the United States was chosen as the\nbirthplace of this new epoch in history for several reasons, one being\nthe proximity to Central and South America; and another the inadequate\npolice system which enables greater freedom of action.\"\n\nHe stopped and drew from his pocket a folded parchment. He tapped the\ntips of his fingers with it from time to time as he talked.\n\n\"The Latin compact, gentlemen, is not the dream, of a night, nor of a\ndecade. As long as fifty years ago it was suggested, and whatever\ndifferences the Latin countries of the world have had among themselves,\nthey have always realized that ultimately they must stand together\nagainst--against the other nations of the world. This idea germinated\ninto action three years ago, and since that time agents have covered the\nworld in its interest. This meeting is the fruition of all that work,\nand this,\" he held the parchment aloft, \"is the instrument that will\nunite us. Never has a diplomatic secret been kept as this has been kept;\nnever has a greater reprisal been planned. It means, gentlemen, the\ndomination of the world--socially, spiritually, commercially and\nartistically; it means that England and the United States, whose sphere\nof influence has extended around the globe, will be beaten back, that\nthe flag of the Latin countries will wave again over lost possessions.\nIt means all of that, and more.\"\n\nHis voice had risen as he talked until it had grown vibrant with\nenthusiasm; and his hands pointed his remarks with quick, sharp\ngestures.\n\n\"All this,\" he went on, \"was never possible until three years ago, when\nthe navies of the world were given over into the hands of one nation--my\ncountry. Five years ago a fellow-countryman of mine happened to be\npresent at an electrical exhibition in New York City, and there he\nwitnessed an interesting experiment--practical demonstration of the fact\nthat a submarine mine may be exploded by the use of the Marconi wireless\nsystem. He was a practical electrician himself, and the idea lingered in\nhis mind. For two years he experimented, and finally this resulted.\" He\npicked up the metal spheroid and held it out for their inspection. \"As\nit stands it is absolutely perfect and gives a world's supremacy to the\nLatin countries because it places all the navies of the world at our\nmercy. It is a variation of the well-known percussion cap or fuse by\nwhich mines and torpedoes are exploded.\n\n\"The theory of it is simple, as are the theories of all great\ninventions; the secret of its construction is known only to its\ninventor--a man of whom you never heard. It is merely that the mechanism\nof the cap is so delicate that the Marconi wireless waves--and _only_\nthose--will fire the cap. In other words, this cap is tuned, if I may\nuse the word, to a certain number of vibrations and half-vibrations; a\nwireless instrument of high power, with a modifying addition which the\ninventor has added, has only to be set in motion to discharge it at any\ndistance up to twenty-five miles. High power wireless waves recognize no\nobstacle, so the explosion of a submarine mine is as easily brought\nabout as would be the explosion of a mine on dry land. You will readily\nsee its value as a protective agency for our seaports.\"\n\nHe replaced the spheroid on the table.\n\n\"But its chief value is not in that,\" he resumed. \"Its chief value to\nthe Latin compact, gentlemen, is that the United States and England are\nnow concluding negotiations, unknown to each other, by which _they_ will\nprotect _their_ seaports by means of mines primed with this cap. The\ntuning of the caps which we will use is known only to us; _the tuning of\nthe caps which they will use is also known to us_! The addition to the\nwireless apparatus which they will use is such that they _can not_, even\nby accident, explode a mine guarding our seaports; but, on the other\nhand, the addition to the wireless apparatus which _we_ will use permits\nof the extreme high charge which will explode their mines. To make it\nclearer, we could send a navy against such a city as New York or\nLiverpool, and explode every mine in front of us as we went; and\nmeanwhile our mines are impervious.\n\n\"Another word, and I have finished. Five gentlemen, whom I imagine are\npresent now, have witnessed a test of this cap, by direct command of\ntheir home governments. For the benefit of the others of you a simple\ntest has been arranged for to-night. This cap on the table is charged;\nits inventor is at his wireless instrument, fifteen miles away. At three\no'clock he will turn on the current that will explode it.\" Four of the\neleven men looked at their watches. \"It is now seventeen minutes past\ntwo. I am instructed, for the purposes of the test, to place this cap\nanywhere you may select--in this house or outside of it, in a box,\nsealed, or under water. The purpose is merely to demonstrate its\nefficacy; to prove to your complete satisfaction that it can be exploded\nunder practically any conditions.\"\n\nHis entire manner underwent a change; he drew a chair up to the table,\nand stood for an instant with his hand resting on the back.\n\n\"The compact is written in three languages--English, French and\nItalian. I shall ask you to sign, after reading either or all, precisely\nas the directions you have received from your home government instruct.\nOn behalf of the three greatest Latin countries, as special envoy of\neach, I will sign first.\"\n\nHe dropped into the chair, signed each of the three parchment pages\nthree times, then rose and offered the pen to the cowled figure at one\nend of the semicircle. The man came forward, read the English\ntranscript, studied the three signatures already there with a certain\nair of surprise, then signed. The second man signed, the third man, and\nthe fourth.\n\nThe fifth had just risen to go forward when the door opened silently and\nMr. Grimm entered. Without a glance either to right or left, he went\nstraight toward the table, and extended a hand to take the compact.\n\nFor an instant there had come amazement, a dumb astonishment, at the\nintrusion. It passed, and the hand of the man who had done the talking\ndarted out, seized the compact, and held it behind him.\n\n\"If you will be good enough to give that to me, your Highness,\"\nsuggested Mr. Grimm quietly.\n\nFor half a minute the masked man stared straight into the listless eyes\nof the intruder, and then:\n\n\"Mr. Grimm, you are in very grave danger.\"\n\n\"That is beside the question,\" was the reply. \"Be good enough to give me\nthat document.\"\n\nHe backed away as he spoke, kicked the door closed with one heel, then\nleaned against it, facing them.\n\n\"Or better yet,\" he went on after a moment, \"burn it. There is a lamp in\nfront of you.\" He paused for an answer. \"It would be absurd of me to\nattempt to take it by force,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTHE PERCUSSION CAP\n\n\nThere was a long, tense silence. The cowled figures had risen ominously;\nMiss Thorne paled behind her mask, and her fingers gripped her palms\nfiercely, still she sat motionless. Prince d'Abruzzi broke the silence.\nHe seemed perfectly calm and self-possessed.\n\n\"How did you get in?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Throttled your guard at the front door, took him down cellar and locked\nhim in the coal-bin,\" replied Mr. Grimm tersely. \"I am waiting for you\nto burn it.\"\n\n\"And how did you escape from--from the other place?\"\n\nMr. Grimm shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"The lamp is in front of you,\" he said.\n\n\"And find your way here?\" the prince pursued.\n\nAgain Mr. Grimm shrugged his shoulders. For an instant longer the prince\ngazed straight into his inscrutable face, then turned accusing eyes on\nthe masked figures about him.\n\n\"Is there a traitor?\" he demanded suddenly. His gaze settled on Miss\nThorne and lingered there.\n\n\"I can relieve your mind on that point--there is not,\" Mr. Grimm assured\nhim. \"Just a final word, your Highness, if you will permit me. I have\nheard everything that has been said here for the last fifteen minutes.\nThe details of your percussion cap are interesting. I shall lay them\nbefore my government and my government may take it upon itself to lay\nthem before the British government. You yourself said a few minutes ago\nthat this compact was not possible before this cap was invented and\nperfected. It isn't possible the minute my government is warned against\nits use. That will be my first duty.\"\n\n\"You are giving some very excellent reasons, Mr. Grimm,\" was the\ndeliberate reply, \"why you should not be permitted to leave this room\nalive.\"\n\n\"Further,\" Mr. Grimm resumed in the same tone, \"I have been ordered to\nprevent the signing of that compact, at least in this country. It seems\nthat I am barely in time. If it is signed--and it will be useless now on\nyour own statement unless you murder me--every man who signs it will\nhave to reckon with the highest power of this country. Will you destroy\nit? I don't want to know what countries already stand committed by the\nsignatures there.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" was the steady response. And then, after a little: \"Mr.\nGrimm, the inventor of this little cap, insignificant as it seems, will\nreceive millions for it. Your silence would be worth--just how much?\"\n\nMr. Grimm's face turned red, then white again.\n\n\"Which would you prefer? An independence by virtue of a great fortune,\nor--or the other thing?\"\n\nSuddenly Miss Thorne tore the mask from her face and came forward. Her\ncheeks were scarlet, and anger flamed in the blue-gray eyes.\n\n\"Mr. Grimm has no price--I happen to know that,\" she declared hotly.\n\"Neither money nor a consideration for his own personal safety will make\nhim turn traitor.\" She stared coldly into the prince's eyes. \"And we are\nnot assassins here,\" she added.\n\n\"Miss Thorne has stated the matter fairly, I believe, your Highness,\"\nand Mr. Grimm permitted his eyes to linger a moment on the flushed face\nof this woman who, in a way, was defending him. \"But there is only one\nthing to do, Miss Thorne.\" He was talking to her now. \"There is no\nmiddle course. It is a problem that has only one possible answer--the\ndestruction of that document, and the departure of you, and you, your\nHighness, for Italy under my personal care all the way. I imagined this\nmatter had ended that day on the steamer; it _will_ end here, now,\nto-night.\"\n\nThe prince glanced again at his watch, then thoughtfully weighed the\npercussion cap in his hand, after which, with a curious laugh, he walked\nover to the squat iron globe in an opposite corner of the room. He bent\nover it half a minute, then straightened up.\n\n\"That cap, Mr. Grimm, has one disadvantage,\" he remarked casually. \"When\nit is attached to a mine or torpedo it can not be disconnected without\nfiring it. It is attached.\" He turned to the others. \"It is needless to\ndiscuss the matter further just now. If you will follow me? We will\nleave Mr. Grimm here.\"\n\nWith a strange little cry, neither anger nor anguish, yet oddly\npartaking of the quality of each, Isabel went quickly to the prince.\n\n\"How dare you do such a thing?\" she demanded fiercely. \"It is murder.\"\n\n\"This is not a time, Miss Thorne, for your interference,\" replied the\nprince coldly. \"It has all passed beyond the point where the feelings\nof any one person, even the feelings of the woman who has engineered the\ncompact, can be considered. A single life can not be permitted to stand\nin the way of the consummation of this world project. Mr. Grimm alive\nmeans the compact would be useless, if not impossible; Mr. Grimm dead\nmeans the fruition of all our plans and hopes. You have done your duty\nand you have done it well; but now your authority ends, and I, the\nspecial envoy of--\"\n\n\"Just a moment, please,\" Mr. Grimm interrupted courteously. \"As I\nunderstand it, your Highness, the mine there in the corner is charged?\"\n\n\"Yes. It just happened to be here for purposes of experiment.\"\n\n\"The cap is attached?\"\n\n\"Quite right.\" The prince laughed.\n\n\"And at three o'clock, by your watch, the mine will be fired by a\nwireless operator fifteen miles from here?\"\n\n\"Something like that; yes, very much like that,\" assented the prince.\n\n\"Thank you. I merely wanted to understand it.\" Mr. Grimm pulled a chair\nup against the door and sat down, crossing his legs. On his knees rested\nthe barrel of a revolver, glittering, fascinating, in the semi-darkness.\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" and he glanced at his watch, \"it's twenty-one minutes\nof three o'clock. At three that mine will explode. We will all be in the\nroom when it happens, unless his Highness sees fit to destroy the\ncompact.\"\n\nEyes sought eyes, and the prince removed his mask with a sudden gesture.\nHis face was bloodless.\n\n\"If any man,\" and Mr. Grimm gave Miss Thorne a quick glance, \"I should\nsay, _any person_, attempts to leave this room I _know_ he will die; and\nthere's a bare chance that the percussion cap will fail to work. I can\naccount for six of you, if there is a rush.\"\n\n\"But, man, if that mine explodes we shall all be killed--blown to\npieces!\" burst from one of the cowled figures.\n\n\"If the percussion cap works,\" supplemented Mr. Grimm.\n\nMingled emotions struggled in the flushed face of Isabel as she studied\nMr. Grimm's impassive countenance.\n\n\"I have never disappointed you yet, Miss Thorne,\" he remarked as if it\nwere an explanation. \"I shall not now.\"\n\nShe turned to the prince.\n\n\"Your Highness, I think it needless to argue further,\" she said. \"We\nhave no choice in the matter; there is only one course--destroy the\ncompact.\"\n\n\"No!\" was the curt answer.\n\n\"I believe I know Mr. Grimm better than you do,\" she argued. \"You think\nhe will weaken; I know he will not. I am not arguing for him, nor for\nmyself; I am arguing against the frightful loss that will come here in\nthis room if the compact is not destroyed.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"You think he will weaken; I know he will not.\"]\n\n\"It's absurd to let one man stand in the way,\" declared the prince\nangrily.\n\n\"It might not be an impertinent question, your Highness,\" commented Mr.\nGrimm, \"for me to ask how you are going to _prevent_ one man standing in\nthe way?\"\n\nA quick change came over Miss Thorne's face. The eyes hardened, the lips\nwere set, and lines Mr. Grimm had never seen appeared about the mouth.\nHere, in a flash, the cloak of dissimulation was cast aside, and the\nwoman stood forth, this keen, brilliant, determined woman who did\nthings.\n\n\"The compact will be destroyed,\" she said.\n\n\"No,\" declared the prince.\n\n\"It _must_ be destroyed.\"\n\n\"_Must? Must?_ Do you say _must to me?_\"\n\n\"Yes, _must_,\" she repeated steadily.\n\n\"And by what authority, please, do--\"\n\n\"By that authority!\" She drew a tiny, filigreed gold box from her bosom\nand cast it upon the table; the prince stared at it. \"In the name of\nyour sovereign--_must_!\" she said again.\n\nThe prince turned away and began pacing, back and forth across the room\nwith the parchment crumpled in his hand. For a minute or more Isabel\nstood watching him.\n\n\"Thirteen minutes!\" Mr. Grimm announced coldly.\n\nAnd now broke out an excited chatter, a babel of French, English,\nItalian, Spanish; those masked and cowled ones who had held silence for\nso long all began talking at once. One of them snatched at the crumpled\ncompact in the prince's hand, while all crowded around him arguing. Mr.\nGrimm sat perfectly still with the revolver barrel resting on his knees.\n\n\"Eleven minutes!\" he announced again.\n\nSuddenly the prince turned violently on Miss Thorne with rage-distorted\nface.\n\n\"Do you know what it means to you if I do as you say?\" he demanded\nsavagely. \"It means you will be branded as traitor, that your name,\nyour property--\"\n\n\"If you will pardon me, your Highness,\" she interrupted, \"the power that\nI have used was given to me to use; I have used it. It is a matter to be\nsettled between me and my government, and as far as it affects my person\nis of no consequence now. You will destroy the compact.\"\n\n\"Nine minutes!\" said Mr. Grimm monotonously.\n\nAgain the babel broke out.\n\n\"Do we understand that you want to see the compact?\" one of the cowled\nmen asked suddenly of Mr. Grimm as he turned.\n\n\"No, I don't want to see it. I'd prefer not to see it.\"\n\nWith hatred blazing in his eyes the prince made his way toward the lamp,\nholding a parchment toward the blaze.\n\n\"There's nothing else to be done,\" he exclaimed savagely.\n\n\"Just a moment, please,\" Mr. Grimm interposed quickly. \"Miss Thorne, is\nthat the compact?\"\n\nShe glanced at it, nodded her head, and then the flame caught the\nfringed edge of paper. It crackled, flashed, flamed, and at last, a\nthing of ashes, was scattered on the floor. Mr. Grimm rose.\n\n\"That is all, gentlemen,\" he announced courteously. \"You are free to go.\nYou, your Highness, and Miss Thorne, will accompany me.\"\n\nHe held open the door and there was almost a scramble to get out. The\nprince and Miss Thorne waited until the last.\n\n\"And, Miss Thorne, if you will give us a lift in your car?\" Mr. Grimm\nsuggested. \"It is now four minutes of three.\"\n\nThe automobile came in answer to a signal and the three in silence\nentered it. The car trembled and had just begun to move when Mr. Grimm\nremembered something, and leaped out.\n\n\"Wait for me!\" he called. \"There's a man locked in the coal-bin!\"\n\nHe disappeared into the house, and Miss Thorne, with a gasp of horror\nsank back in her seat with face like chalk. The prince glanced uneasily\nat his watch, then spoke curtly to the chauffeur.\n\n\"Run the car up out of danger; there'll be an explosion there in a\nmoment.\"\n\nThey had gone perhaps a hundred feet when the building they had just\nleft seemed to be lifted bodily from the ground by a great spurt of\nflame which tore through its center, then collapsed like a thing of\ncards. The prince, unmoved, glanced around at Miss Thorne; she lay in a\ndead faint beside him.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he commanded. \"Baltimore.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nTHE PERSONAL EQUATION\n\n\nMr. Campbell ceased talking and the deep earnestness that had settled on\nhis face passed, leaving instead the blank, inscrutable mask of\nbenevolence behind which his clock-like genius was habitually hidden.\nThe choleric blue eyes of the president of the United States shifted\ninquiringly to the thoughtful countenance of the secretary of state at\nhis right, thence along the table around which the official family was\ngathered. It was a special meeting of the cabinet called at the\nsuggestion of Chief Campbell, and for more than an hour he had done the\ntalking. There had been no interruption.\n\n\"So much!\" he concluded, at last. \"If there is any point I have not made\nclear Mr. Grimm is here to explain it in person.\"\n\nMr. Grimm rose at the mention of his name and stood with his hands\nclasped behind his back. His eyes met those of the chief executive\nlistlessly.\n\n\"We understand, Mr. Grimm,\" the president began, and he paused for an\ninstant to regard the tall, clean-cut young man with a certain\nadmiration, \"we understand that there does not actually exist such a\nthing as a Latin compact against the English-speaking peoples?\"\n\n\"On paper, no,\" was the reply.\n\n\"You personally prevented the signing of the compact?\"\n\n\"I personally caused the destruction of the compact after several\nsignatures had been attached,\" Mr. Grimm amended. \"Throughout I have\nacted under the direction of Mr. Campbell, of course.\"\n\n\"You were in very grave personal danger?\" the president went on.\n\n\"It was of no consequence,\" said Mr. Grimm simply.\n\nThe president glanced at Mr. Campbell and the chief shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\n\"You are certain, Mr. Grimm,\" and the president spoke with great\ndeliberation, \"you are certain that the representatives of the Latin\ncountries have not met since and signed the compact?\"\n\n\"I am not certain--no,\" replied Mr. Grimm promptly. \"I am certain,\nhowever, that the backbone of the alliance was broken--its only excuse\nfor existence destroyed--when they permitted me to learn of the wireless\npercussion cap which would have placed the navies of the world at their\nmercy. Believe me, gentlemen, if they had kept their secret it would\nhave given them dominion of the earth. They made one mistake,\" he added\nin a most matter-of-fact tone. \"They should have killed me; it was their\nonly chance.\"\n\nThe president seemed a little startled at the suggestion.\n\n\"That would have been murder,\" he remarked.\n\n\"True,\" Mr. Grimm acquiesced, \"but it seems an absurd thing that they\nshould have permitted the life of one man to stand between them and the\nworld power for which they had so long planned and schemed. His\nHighness, Prince Benedetto d'Abruzzi believed as I do, and so expressed\nhimself.\" He paused a moment; there was a hint of surprise in his\nmanner. \"I expected to be killed, of course. It seemed to me the only\nthing that could happen.\"\n\n\"They must have known of the far-reaching consequences which would\nfollow upon your escape, Mr. Grimm. Why _didn't_ they kill you?\"\n\nMr. Grimm made a little gesture with both hands and was silent.\n\n\"May they not yet attempt it?\" the president insisted.\n\n\"It's too late now,\" Mr. Grimm explained. \"They had everything to gain\nby killing me there as I stood in the room where I had interrupted the\nsigning of the compact, because that would have been before I had placed\nthe facts in the hands of my government. I was the only person outside\nof their circle who knew all of them. Only the basest motive could\ninspire them to attempt my life now.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The secretary of state glanced from Mr. Grimm to Mr.\nCampbell with a question in his deep-set eyes.\n\n\"Do I understand that you placed a Miss Thorne and the prince\nunder--that is, you detained them?\" he queried. \"If so, where are they\nnow?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" was the reply. \"Just before the explosion the three of\nus entered an automobile together, and then as we were starting away I\nremembered something which made it necessary for me to reenter the\nhouse. When I came out again, just a few seconds before the explosion,\nthe prince and Miss Thorne had gone.\"\n\nThe secretary's lips curled down in disapproval.\n\n\"Wasn't it rather unusual, to put it mildly, to leave your prisoners to\ntheir own devices that way?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" Mr. Grimm admitted. \"But the circumstances were unusual.\nWhen I entered the house I had locked a man in the cellar. I had to go\nback to save his life, otherwise--\"\n\n\"Oh, the guard at the door, you mean?\" came the interruption. \"Who was\nit?\"\n\nMr. Grimm glanced at his chief, who nodded.\n\n\"It was Mr. Charles Winthrop Rankin of the German embassy,\" said the\nyoung man.\n\n\"Mr. Rankin of the German embassy was on guard at the door?\" demanded\nthe president quickly.\n\n\"Yes. We got out safely.\"\n\n\"And that means that Germany was--!\"\n\nThe president paused and startled glances passed around the table. After\na moment of deep abstraction the secretary went on:\n\n\"So Miss Thorne and the prince escaped. Are they still in this country?\"\n\n\"That I don't know,\" replied Mr. Grimm. He stood silent a moment,\nstaring at the president. Some subtle change crept into the listless\neyes, and his lips were set. \"Perhaps I had better explain here that the\npersonal equation enters largely into an affair of this kind,\" he said\nat last, slowly. \"It happens that it entered into this. Unless I am\nordered to pursue the matter further I think it would be best for all\nconcerned to accept the fact of Miss Thorne's escape, and--\" He stopped.\n\nThere was a long, thoughtful silence. Every man in the room was studying\nMr. Grimm's impassive face.\n\n\"Personal equation,\" mused the president. \"Just how, Mr. Grimm, does the\npersonal equation enter into the affair?\"\n\nThe young man's lips closed tightly, and then:\n\n\"There are some people, Mr. President, whom we meet frankly as enemies,\nand we deal with them accordingly; and there are others who oppose us\nand yet are not enemies. It is merely that our paths of duty cross. We\nmay have the greatest respect for them and they for us, but purposes are\nunalterably different. In other words there is a personal enmity and a\npolitical enmity. You, for instance, might be a close personal friend of\nthe man whom you defeated for president. There might\"--he stopped\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Go on,\" urged the president.\n\n\"I think every man meets once in his life an individual with whom he\nwould like to reckon personally,\" the young man continued. \"That\nreckoning may not be a severe one; it may be less severe than the law\nwould provide; but it would be a personal reckoning. There is one\nindividual in this affair with whom I should like to reckon, hence the\npersonal equation enters very largely into the case.\"\n\nFor a little while the silence of the room was unbroken, save for the\nsteady tick-tock of a great clock in one corner. Mr. Grimm's eyes were\nfixed unwaveringly upon those of the chief executive. At last the\nsecretary of war crumpled a sheet of paper impatiently and hitched his\nchair up to the table.\n\n\"Coming down to the facts it's like this, isn't it?\" he demanded\nbriskly. \"The Latin countries, by an invention of their own which the\nUnited States and England were to be duped into purchasing, would have\nhad power to explode every submarine mine before attacking a port? Very\nwell. This thing, of course, would have given them the freedom of the\nseas as long as we were unable to explode their submarines as they were\nable to explode ours. And this is the condition which made the Latin\ncompact possible, isn't it?\"\n\nHe looked straight at Mr. Grimm, who nodded.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he went on, \"if the Latin compact is not a reality on\npaper; if the United States and England do not purchase this--this\nwireless percussion cap, we are right back where we were before it all\nhappened, aren't we? Every possible danger from that direction has\npassed, hasn't it? The world-war of which we have been talking is\nrendered impossible, isn't it?\"\n\n\"That's a question,\" answered Mr. Grimm. \"If you will pardon me for\nsuggesting it, I would venture to say that as long as there is an\ninvention of that importance in the hands of nations whom we now know\nhave been conspiring against us for fifty years, there is always danger.\nIt seems to me, if you will pardon me again, that for the sake of peace\nwe must either get complete control of that invention or else understand\nit so well that there can be no further danger. And again, please let me\ncall your attention to the fact that the brain which brought this thing\ninto existence is still to be reckoned with. There may, some day, come a\ntime when our submarines may be exploded at will regardless of this\npercussion cap.\"\n\nThe secretary of war turned flatly upon Chief Campbell.\n\n\"This woman who is mixed up in this affair?\" he demanded. \"This Miss\nThorne. Who is she?\"\n\n\"Who is she?\" repeated the chief. \"She's a secret agent of Italy, one of\nthe most brilliant, perhaps, that has ever operated in this or any other\ncountry. She is the pivot around which the intrigue moved. We know her\nby a dozen names; any one of them may be correct.\"\n\nThe brows of the secretary of war were drawn down in thought as he\nturned to the president.\n\n\"Mr. Grimm was speaking of the personal equation,\" he remarked\npointedly. \"I think perhaps his meaning is clear when we know there is a\nwoman in the case. We know that Mr. Grimm has done his duty to the last\ninch in this matter; we know that alone and unaided, practically, he has\ndone a thing that no living man of his relative position has ever done\nbefore--prevented a world-war. But there is further danger--he himself\nhas called our attention to it--therefore, I would suggest that Mr.\nGrimm be relieved of further duty in this particular case. This is not a\nmoment when the peace of the world may be imperiled by personal feelings\nof--of kindliness for an individual.\"\n\nMr. Grimm received the blow without a tremor. His hands were still idly\nclasped behind his back; the eyes fastened upon the president's face\nwere still listless; the mouth absolutely without expression.\n\n\"As Mr. Grimm has pointed out,\" the secretary went on, \"we have been\nnegotiating for this wireless percussion cap. I have somewhere in my\noffice the name and address of the individual with whom these\nnegotiations have been conducted. Through that it is possible to reach\nthe inventor, and then--! I suggest that we vote our thanks to Mr. Grimm\nand relieve him of this particular case.\"\n\nThe choleric eyes of the president softened a little, and grew grave as\nthey studied the impassive face of the young man.\n\n\"It's a strange situation, Mr. Grimm,\" he said evenly. \"What do you say\nto withdrawing?\"\n\n\"I am at your orders, Mr. President,\" was the reply.\n\n\"No one knows better what you have done than the gentlemen here at this\ntable,\" the president went on slowly. \"No one questions that you have\ndone more than any other man could have done under the circumstances. We\nunderstand, I think, that indirectly you are asking immunity for an\nindividual. I don't happen to know the liability of that individual\nunder our law, but we can't make any mistake now, Mr. Grimm, and so--and\nso--\" He stopped and was silent.\n\n\"I had hoped, Mr. President, that what I have done so far--and I don't\nunderestimate it--would have, at least, earned for me the privilege of\nremaining in this case until its conclusion,\" said Mr. Grimm steadily.\n\"If it is to be otherwise, of course I am at--\"\n\n\"History tells us, Mr. Grimm,\" interrupted the president irrelevantly,\n\"that the frou-frou of a woman's skirt has changed the map of the world.\nDo you believe,\" he went on suddenly, \"that a man can mete out justice\nfairly, severely if necessary, to one for whom he has a personal\nregard?\"\n\n\"I do, sir.\"\n\n\"Perhaps even to one--to a woman whom he might love?\"\n\n\"I do, sir.\"\n\nThe president rose.\n\n\"Please wait in the anteroom for a few minutes,\" he directed.\n\nMr. Grimm bowed himself out. At the end of half an hour he was again\nsummoned into the cabinet chamber. The president met him with\noutstretched hand. There was more than mere perfunctory thanks in\nthis--there was the understanding of man and man.\n\n\"You will proceed with the case to the end, Mr. Grimm,\" he instructed\nabruptly. \"If you need assistance ask for it; if not, proceed alone.\nYou will rely upon your own judgment entirely. If there are\ncircumstances which make it inadvisable to move against an individual by\nlegal process, even if that individual is amenable to our laws, you are\nnot constrained so to do if your judgment is against it. There is one\nstipulation: You will either secure the complete rights of the wireless\npercussion cap to this government or learn the secret of the invention\nso that at no future time can we be endangered by it.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Grimm quietly. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"I may add that it is a matter of deep regret to me,\" and the president\nbrought one vigorous hand down on the young man's shoulder, \"that our\ngovernment has so few men of your type in its service. Good day.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nWE TWO\n\n\nMr. Grimm turned from Pennsylvania Avenue into a cross street, walked\nalong half a block or so, climbed a short flight of stairs and entered\nan office.\n\n\"Is Mr. Howard in?\" he queried of a boy in attendance.\n\n\"Name, please.\"\n\nMr. Grimm handed over a sealed envelope which bore the official imprint\nof the Department of War in the upper left hand corner; and the boy\ndisappeared into a room beyond. A moment later he emerged and held open\nthe door for Mr. Grimm. A gentleman--Mr. Howard--rose from his seat and\nstared at him as he entered.\n\n\"This note, Mr. Grimm, is surprising,\" he remarked.\n\n\"It is only a request from the secretary of war that I be permitted to\nmeet the inventor of the wireless percussion cap,\" Mr. Grimm explained\ncarelessly. \"The negotiations have reached a point where the War\nDepartment must have one or two questions answered directly by the\ninventor. Simple enough, you see.\"\n\n\"But it has been understood, and I have personally impressed it upon the\nsecretary of war that such a meeting is impossible,\" objected Mr.\nHoward. \"All negotiations have been conducted through me, and I have, as\nattorney for the inventor, the right to answer any question that may\nproperly be answered. This now is a request for a personal interview\nwith the inventor.\"\n\n\"The necessity for such an interview has risen unexpectedly, because of\na pressing need of either closing the deal or allowing it to drop,\" Mr.\nGrimm stated. \"I may add that the success of the deal depends entirely\non this interview.\"\n\nMr. Howard was leaning forward in his chair with wrinkled brow intently\nstudying the calm face of the young man. Innocent himself of all the\nintrigue and international chicanery back of the affair, representing\nonly an individual in these secret negotiations, he saw in the\nstatement, as Mr. Grimm intended that he should, the possible climax of\na great business contract. His greed was aroused; it might mean hundreds\nof thousands of dollars to him.\n\n\"Do you think the deal can be made?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"I have no doubt there will be some sort of a deal,\" replied Mr. Grimm.\n\"As I say, however, it is absolutely dependent on an interview between\nthe inventor and myself at once--this afternoon.\"\n\nMr. Howard thoughtfully drummed on his desk for a little while. From the\nfirst, save in so far as the patent rights were concerned, he had seen\nno reasons for the obligations of utter secrecy which had been enforced\nupon him. Perhaps, if he laid it before the inventor in this new light,\nwith the deal practically closed, the interview would be possible!\n\n\"I have no choice in the matter, Mr. Grimm,\" he said at last. \"I shall\nhave to put it to my client, of course. Can you give me, say, half an\nhour to communicate with him?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" and Mr. Grimm rose obligingly. \"Shall I wait outside here\nor call again?\"\n\n\"You may wait if you don't mind,\" said Mr. Howard. \"I'll be able to let\nyou know in a few minutes, I hope.\"\n\nMr. Grimm bowed and passed out. At the end of twenty-five minutes the\ndoor of Mr. Howard's private office opened and he appeared. His face was\nviolently red, evidently from anger, and perspiration stood on his\nforehead.\n\n\"I can't do anything with him,\" he declared savagely. \"He says simply\nthat negotiations must be conducted through me or not at all.\"\n\nMr. Grimm had risen; he bowed courteously.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said placidly. \"You understand, of course, as the note\nsays, that this refusal of his terminates the negotiations, so--\"\n\n\"But just a moment--\" interposed Mr. Howard quickly.\n\n\"Good day,\" said Mr. Grimm.\n\nThe door opened and closed; he was gone. Three minutes later he stepped\ninto a telephone booth at a near-by corner and took down the receiver.\n\n\"Hello, central!\" he called, and then: \"This is Mr. Grimm of the Secret\nService. What number was Mr. Howard talking to?\"\n\n\"Eleven double-nought six, Alexandria,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Where is the connection? In whose name?\"\n\n\"The connection is five miles out from Alexandria in a farm-house on the\nold Baltimore Road,\" came the crisp, business-like answer. \"The name is\nMurdock Williams.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mr. Grimm. \"Good-by.\"\n\nA moment later he was standing by the curb waiting for a car, when\nHoward, still angry, and with an expression of deep chagrin on his\nface, came bustling up.\n\n\"If you can give me until to-morrow afternoon, then--\" he began.\n\nMr. Grimm glanced around at him, and with a slight motion of his head\nsummoned two men who had been chatting near-by. One of them was Blair,\nand the other Hastings.\n\n\"Take this man in charge,\" he directed. \"Hold him in solitary\nconfinement until you hear from me. Don't talk to him, don't let any one\nelse talk to him, and don't let him talk. If any person speaks to him\nbefore he is locked up, take that person in charge also. He is guilty of\nno crime, but a single word from him now will endanger my life.\"\n\nThat was all. It was said and done so quickly that Howard, dazed,\nconfused and utterly unable to account for anything, was led away\nwithout a protest. Mr. Grimm, musing gently on the stupidity of mankind\nin general and the ease with which it is possible to lead even a clever\nindividual into a trap, if the bait appeals to greed, took a car and\nwent up town.\n\nSome three hours later he walked briskly along a narrow path strewn with\npine needles, which led tortuously up to an old colonial farmhouse.\nOutwardly the place seemed to be deserted. The blinds, battered and\nstripped of paint by wind and rain, were all closed and one corner of\nthe small veranda had crumbled away from age and neglect. In the rear of\nthe house, rising from an old barn, a thin pole with a cup-like\nattachment at the apex, thrust its point into the open above the dense,\nodorous pines. Mr. Grimm noted these things as he came along.\n\nHe stepped up quietly on the veranda and had just extended one hand to\nrap on the door when it was opened from within, and Miss Thorne stood\nbefore him. He was not surprised; intuition had told him he would meet\nher again, perhaps here in hiding. A sudden quick tenderness lighted the\nlistless eyes. For an instant she stood staring, her face pallid against\nthe gloom of the hallway beyond, and she drew a long breath of relief,\nas she pressed one hand to her breast. The blue-gray eyes were veiled by\ndrooping lids, then she recovered herself and they opened into his. In\nthem he saw anxiety, apprehension, fear even.\n\n\"Miss Thorne!\" he greeted, and he bowed low over the white hand which\nshe impulsively thrust toward him.\n\n\"I--I knew some one was coming,\" she stammered in a half whisper. \"I\ndidn't know it was you; I hadn't known definitely until this instant\nthat you were safe from the explosion. I am glad--glad, you understand;\nglad that you were not--\" She stopped and fought back her emotions, then\nwent on: \"But you must not come in; you must go away at once. Your--your\nlife is in danger here.\"\n\n\"_How_ did you know I was coming?\" inquired Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"From the moment Mr. Howard telephoned,\" she replied, still hastily,\nstill in the mysterious half whisper. \"I knew that it could only be\nsome one from your bureau, and I hoped that it was you. I saw how you\nforced him to call us up here, and that was all you needed. It was\nsimple, of course, to trace the telephone call.\" Both of her hands\nclosed over one of his desperately. \"Now, go, please. The Latin compact\nis at an end; you merely invite death here. Now, go!\"\n\nHer eyes were searching the listless face with entreaty in them; the\nslender fingers were fiercely gripping one of Mr. Grimm's nerveless\nhands. For an instant some strange, softening light flickered in the\nyoung man's eyes, then it passed.\n\n\"I have no choice, Miss Thorne,\" he said gravely at last. \"I am honor\nbound by my government to do one of two things. If I fail in the first\nof those--the greater--it can only be because--\"\n\nHe stopped; hope flamed up in her eyes and she leaned forward eagerly\nstudying the impassive face.\n\n\"Because--?\" she repeated.\n\n\"It can only be because I am killed,\" he added quietly. Suddenly his\nwhole manner changed. \"I should like to see the--the inventor?\"\n\n\"But don't you see--don't you see you _will_ be killed if--?\" she began\ntensely.\n\n\"May I see the inventor, please?\" Mr. Grimm interrupted.\n\nFor a little time she stood, white and rigid, staring at him. Then her\nlids fluttered down wearily, as if to veil some crushing agony within\nher, and she stepped aside. Mr. Grimm entered and the door closed\nnoiselessly behind him. After a moment her hand rested lightly on his\narm, and he was led into a room to his left. This door, too, she closed,\nimmediately turning to face him.\n\n\"We may talk here a few minutes without interruption,\" she said in a low\ntone. Her voice was quite calm now. \"If you will be--?\"\n\n\"Please understand, Miss Thorne,\" he interposed mercilessly, \"that I\nmust see the inventor, whoever he is. What assurance have I that this\nis not some ruse to permit him to escape?\"\n\n\"You have my word of honor,\" she said quite simply.\n\n\"Please go on.\" He sat down.\n\n\"You will see him too soon, I fear,\" she continued slowly. \"If you had\nnot come to him he would have gone to you.\" She swayed a little and\npressed one hand to her eyes. \"I would to God it were in my power to\nprevent that meeting!\" she exclaimed desperately. Then, with an effort:\n\"There are some things I want to explain to you. It may be that you will\nbe willing to go then of your own free will. If I lay bare to you every\nstep I have taken since I have been in Washington; if I make clear to\nyou every obscure point in this hideous intrigue; if I confess to you\nthat the Latin compact has been given up for all time, won't that be\nenough? Won't you go then?\"\n\nMr. Grimm's teeth closed with a snap.\n\n\"I don't want that--from you,\" he declared.\n\n\"But if I should tell it all to you?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"I won't listen, Miss Thorne. You once paid me the compliment of saying\nthat I was one man you knew in whom you had never been disappointed.\"\nThe listless eyes were blazing into her own now. \"_I_ have never been\ndisappointed in you. I will not permit you to disappoint me now. The\nsecrets of your government are mine if I can get them--but I won't allow\nyou to tell them to me.\"\n\n\"My government!\" Miss Thorne repeated, and her lips curled sadly. \"I--I\nhave no government. I have been cast off by that government, stripped of\nmy rank, and branded as a traitor!\"\n\n\"Traitor!\" Mr. Grimm's lips formed the word silently.\n\n\"I failed, don't you see?\" she rushed on. \"Ignominy is the reward of\nfailure. Prince d'Abruzzi went on to New York that night, cabled a full\naccount of the destruction of the compact to my government, and sailed\nhome on the following day. I was the responsible one, and now it all\ncomes back on me.\" For a moment she was silent. \"It's so singular, Mr.\nGrimm. The fight from the first was between us--we two; and you won.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nIN WHICH THEY BOTH WIN\n\n\nMr. Grimm dropped into a chair with his teeth clenched, and his face\nlike chalk. For a minute or more he sat there turning it all over in his\nmind. Truly the triumph had been robbed of its splendor when the blow\nfell here--here upon a woman he loved.\n\n\"There's no shame in the confession of one who is fairly beaten,\" Isabel\nwent on softly, after a little. \"There are many things that you don't\nunderstand. I came to Washington with an authority from my sovereign\nhigher even than that vested in the ambassador; I came _as_ I did and\ncompelled Count di Rosini to obtain an invitation to the state ball for\nme in order that I might meet a representative of Russia there that\nnight and receive an answer as to whether or not they would join the\ncompact. I received that answer; its substance is of no consequence now.\n\n\"And you remember where I first met you? It was while you were\ninvestigating the shooting of Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez in the German embassy. That\nshooting, as you know, was done by Prince d'Abruzzi, so almost from the\nbeginning my plans went wrong because of the assumption of authority by\nthe prince. The paper he took from Se\u00c3\u00b1or Alvarez after the shooting was\nsupposed to bear vitally upon Mexico's attitude toward our plan, but, as\nit developed, it was about another matter entirely.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"The event of that night which you did _not_ learn was that Germany\nagreed to join the compact upon conditions. Mr. Rankin, who was attached\nto the German embassy in an advisory capacity, delivered the answer to\nme, and I pretended to faint in order that I might reasonably avoid\nyou.\"\n\n\"I surmised that much,\" remarked Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"The telegraphing I did with my fan was as much to distract your\nattention as anything else, and at the same time to identify myself to\nMr. Rankin, whom I had never met. You knew him, of course; I didn't.\"\n\nShe was silent a while as her eyes steadily met those of Mr. Grimm.\nFinally she went on:\n\n\"When next I met you it was in the Venezuelan legation; you were\ninvestigating the theft of the fifty thousand dollars in gold from the\nsafe. I thrust myself into that case, because I was afraid of you; and\nmercilessly destroyed a woman's name in your eyes to further my plans. I\nmade you believe that Se\u00c3\u00b1orita Rodriguez stole that fifty thousand\ndollars, and I returned it to you, presumably, while we stood in her\nroom that night. Only it was not her room--it was _mine!_ _I_ stole the\nfifty thousand dollars! All the details, even to her trip to see Mr.\nGriswold in Baltimore in company with Mr. Cadwallader, had been\ncarefully worked out; and she _did_ bring me the combination of the safe\nfrom Mr. Griswold on the strength of a forged letter. But she didn't\nknow it. There was no theft, of course. I had no intention of keeping\nthe money. It was necessary to take it to distract attention from the\nthing I _did_ do--break a lock inside the safe to get a sealed packet\nthat contained Venezuela's answer to our plan. I sealed that packet\nagain, and there was never a suspicion that it had been opened.\"\n\n\"Only a suspicion,\" Mr. Grimm corrected.\n\n\"Then came the abduction of Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur, the French ambassador. I\nplunged into that case as I did in the other because I was afraid of you\nand had to know just how much you knew. It was explained to you as an\nattempt at extortion with details which I carefully supplied. As a\nmatter of fact, Monsieur Boiss\u00c3\u00a9gur opposed our plans, even endangered\nthem; and it was not advisable to have him recalled or even permit him\nto resign at the moment. So we abducted him, intending to hold him\nuntil direct orders could reach him from Paris. Understand, please, that\nall these things were made possible by the aid and cooperation of\ndozens, scores, of agents who were under my orders; every person who\nappeared in that abduction was working at my direction. The ambassador's\nunexpected escape disarranged our plans; but he was taken out of the\nembassy by force the second time under your very eyes. The darkness\nwhich made this possible was due to the fact that while you were looking\nfor the switch, and I was apparently aiding, I was holding my hand over\nit all the time to keep you from turning on the light. You remember\nthat?\"\n\nMr. Grimm nodded.\n\n\"All the rest of it you know,\" she concluded wearily. \"You compelled me\nto leave the Venezuelan legation by your espionage, but in the crowded\nhotel to which I moved I had little difficulty avoiding your Mr.\nHastings, your Mr. Blair and your Mr. Johnson, so I came and went\nfreely without your knowledge. The escape of the prince from prison you\narranged, so you understand all of that, as well as the meeting and\nattempted signing of the compact, and the rapid recovery of Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nAlvarez. And, after all, it was my fault that our plans failed, because\nif I had not been--been uneasy as to your condition and had not made the\nmistake of going to the deserted little house where you were a prisoner,\nthe plans would have succeeded, the compact been signed.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to understand,\" said Mr. Grimm gravely, and a wistful,\ntender look crept into his eyes. \"If it had not been for that act\nof--consideration and kindness to me--\"\n\n\"We would have succeeded in spite of you,\" explained Isabel. \"We were\nafraid of you, Mr. Grimm. It was a compliment to you that we considered\nit necessary to account for your whereabouts at the time of the signing\nof the compact.\"\n\n\"And if you had succeeded,\" remarked Mr. Grimm, \"the whole civilized\nworld would have come to war.\"\n\n\"I never permitted myself to think of it that way,\" she replied frankly.\n\"There is something splendid to me in a battle of brains; there is\nexaltation, stimulation, excitement in it. It has always possessed the\ngreatest fascination for me. I have always won, you know, until now. I\nfailed! And my reward is 'Traitor!'\"\n\n\"Just a word of assurance now,\" she went on after a moment. \"The Latin\ncompact has been definitely given up; the plan has been dismissed,\nthanks to you; the peace of the world is unbroken. And who am I? I know\nyou have wondered; I know your agents have scoured the world to find\nout. I am the daughter of a former Italian ambassador to the Court of\nSt. James. My mother was an English woman. I was born and received my\nearly education in England, hence my perfect knowledge of that tongue.\nIn Rome I am, or have been, alas, the Countess Rosa d'Orsetti; now I am\nan exile with a price on my head. That is all, except for several years\nI was a trusted agent of my government, and a friend of my queen.\"\n\nShe rose and extended both hands graciously. Mr. Grimm seized the\nslender white fingers and stood with eyes fixed upon hers. Slowly a\nflush crept into her pallid cheeks, and she bowed her head.\n\n\"Wonderful woman!\" he said softly.\n\n\"I shall ask a favor of you now,\" she went on gently. \"Let all this that\nyou have learned take the place of whatever you expected to learn, and\ngo. Believe me, there can only be one result if you meet--if you meet\nthe inventor of the wireless cap upon which so much was staked, and so\nmuch lost.\" She shuddered a little, then raised the blue-gray eyes\nbeseechingly to his face. \"Please go.\"\n\nGo! The word straightened Mr. Grimm in his tracks and he allowed her\nhands to fall limply. Suddenly his face grew hard. In the ecstasy of\nadoration he had momentarily forgotten his purpose here. His eyes lost\ntheir ardor; his nerveless hands dropped beside him.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"You must--you must,\" she urged gently. \"I know what it means to you.\nYou feel it your duty to unravel the secret of the percussion cap? You\ncan't; no man can. No one knows the inventor more intimately than I, and\neven I couldn't get it from him. There are no plans for it in existence,\nand even if there were he would no more sell them than you would have\naccepted a fortune at the hands of Prince d'Abruzzi to remain silent.\nThe compact has failed; you did that. The agents have scattered--gone to\nother duties. That is enough.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Grimm. There was a strange fear tearing at his\nheart,--\"No one knows the inventor more intimately than I.\" \"No,\" he\nsaid again. \"I won from my government a promise to be made good upon a\ncondition--I must fulfil that condition.\"\n\n\"But there is nothing, promotion, honor, reward, that would compensate\nyou for the loss of your life,\" she entreated. \"There is still time.\"\nShe was pleading now, with her slim white hands resting on his\nshoulders, and the blue-gray eyes fixed upon his face.\n\n\"It's more than all that,\" he said. \"That condition is you--your\nsafety.\"\n\n\"For me?\" she repeated. \"For me? Then, won't you go for--for my sake?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Won't you go if you know you will be killed,\" and suddenly her face\nturned scarlet, \"and that your life is dear to me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nIsabel dropped upon her knees before him.\n\n\"This inventor--this man whom you insist on seeing is half insane with\ndisappointment and anger,\" she rushed on desperately. \"Remember that a\nvast fortune, honor, fame were at his finger tips when you--you placed\nthem beyond his reach by the destruction of the compact. He has sworn to\nkill you.\"\n\n\"I can't go!\"\n\n\"If you _know_ that when you meet one of you will die?\"\n\n\"No.\" The answer came fiercely, through clenched teeth. Mr. Grimm\ndisengaged his right hand and drew his revolver; the barrel clicked\nunder his fingers as it spun.\n\n\"If I tell you that of the two human beings in this world whom I love\nthis man is one?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nA shuffling step sounded in the hallway just outside. Mr. Grimm stepped\nback from the kneeling figure, and turned to face the door with his\nrevolver ready.\n\n\"Great God!\" It was a scream of agony. \"He is my brother! Don't you\nsee?\"\n\nShe came to her feet and went staggering across to the door. The key\nclicked in the lock.\n\n\"Your brother!\" exclaimed Mr. Grimm.\n\n\"He wouldn't listen to me--_you_ wouldn't listen to me, and now--and\n_now_! God have mercy!\"\n\nThere was a sharp rattling, a clamor at the door, and Isabel turned to\nMr. Grimm mutely, with arms outstretched. The revolver barrel clicked\nunder his hand, then, after a moment, he replaced the weapon in his\npocket.\n\n\"Please open the door,\" he requested quietly.\n\n\"He'll kill you!\" she screamed.\n\nExhausted, helpless, she leaned against a chair with her face in her\nhands. Mr. Grimm went to her suddenly, tore the hands from her face, and\nmet the tear-stained eyes.\n\n\"I love you,\" he said. \"I want you to know that!\"\n\n\"And I love you--that's why it matters so.\"\n\nLeaving her there, Mr. Grimm strode straight to the door and threw it\nopen. He saw only the outline of a thin little man of indeterminate age,\nthen came a blinding flash under his eyes, and he leaped forward. There\nwas a short, sharp struggle, and both went down. The revolver! He must\nget that! He reached for it with the one idea of disarming this madman.\nThe muzzle was thrust toward him, he threw up his arm to protect his\nhead, and then came a second flash. Instantly he felt the figure in his\narms grow limp; and after a moment he rose. The face of the man on the\nfloor was pearly gray; and a thin, scarlet thread flowed from his\ntemple.\n\n[Illustration: In a stride Mr. Grimm was beside her.]\n\nHe turned toward Isabel. She lay near the chair, a little crumpled heap.\nIn a stride he was beside her, and had lifted her head to his knee. The\nblue-gray eyes opened into his once, then they closed. She had fainted.\nThe first bullet had pierced her arm; it was only a flesh wound. He\nlifted her gently and placed her on a couch, after which he disappeared\ninto another room. In a little while there came the cheerful ting-a-ling\nof a telephone bell.\n\n\"Is this the county constable's office?\" he inquired. \"Well, there's\nbeen a little shooting accident at the Murdock Williams' place, five\nmiles out from Alexandria on the old Baltimore Road. Please send some of\nyour men over to take charge. Two hours from now call up Mr. Grimm at\nSecret Service headquarters in Washington and he will explain. Good-by.\"\n\nAnd a few minutes later Mr. Grimm walked along the road toward an\nautomobile a hundred yards away, bearing Miss Thorne in his arms. The\nchauffeur cranked the machine and climbed to his seat.\n\n\"Washington!\" directed Mr. Grimm. \"Never mind the speed laws.\"\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Elusive Isabel, by Jacques Futrelle\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELUSIVE ISABEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 10943-8.txt or 10943-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/9\/4\/10943\/\n\nProduced by Steven desJardins and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":66,"split":"train"}
