Set in mid-19th century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine, or courtesan, suffering from \"consumption\" (tuberculosis), and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois. Marguerite is nicknamed la dame aux cam\u00e9lias (French\u00a0for 'the lady of the camellias') because she wears a red camellia when she's menstruating and unavailable for making love and a white camelia when she is available to her lovers.\nArmand falls in love with Marguerite and ultimately becomes her lover. He convinces her to leave her life as a courtesan and to live with him in the countryside. This idyllic existence is interrupted by Armand's father, who, concerned with the scandal created by the illicit relationship, and fearful that it will destroy Armand's sister's chances of marriage, convinces Marguerite to leave. Up until Marguerite's death, Armand believes that she left him for another man. Marguerite's death is described as an unending agony, during which Marguerite, abandoned by everyone, regrets what might have been.\nThe story is narrated after Marguerite's death by two male narrators, Armand and an unnamed frame narrator. Some scholars believe that Marguerite's illness and Duplessis's publicized cause of death, \"consumption\", was a 19th-century euphemism for syphilis. Dumas, fils, is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand, and the suffering of the two lovers, whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times, is rendered touchingly. In contrast the Chevalier des Grieux's love for Manon in Manon Lescaut (1731), a French novel by Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost referenced at the beginning of La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias, Armand's love is for a woman who is ready to sacrifice her riches and her lifestyle for him, but who is thwarted by the arrival of Armand's father. The novel is also marked by the description of Parisian life during the 19th century and the fragile world of the courtesan.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Camille (La Dame aux Camilias), by Alexandre Dumas, fils\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Not being old enough to invent, I\ncontent myself with narrating, and I beg the reader to assure himself of\nthe truth of a story in which all the characters, with the exception of\nthe heroine, are still alive. Eye-witnesses of the greater part of the\nfacts which I have collected are to be found in Paris, and I might call\nupon them to confirm me if my testimony is not enough. And, thanks to a\nparticular circumstance, I alone can write these things, for I alone\nam able to give the final details, without which it would have been\nimpossible to make the story at once interesting and complete.\n\nThis is how these details came to my knowledge. On the 12th of March,\n1847, I saw in the Rue Lafitte a great yellow placard announcing a sale\nof furniture and curiosities. The sale was to take place on account of\nthe death of the owner. The owner's name was not mentioned, but the sale\nwas to be held at 9, Rue d'Antin, on the 16th, from 12 to 5. The placard\nfurther announced that the rooms and furniture could be seen on the 13th\nand 14th.\n\nI have always been very fond of curiosities, and I made up my mind not\nto miss the occasion, if not of buying some, at all events of seeing\nthem. Next day I called at 9, Rue d'Antin.\n\nIt was early in the day, and yet there were already a number of\nvisitors, both men and women, and the women, though they were dressed\nin cashmere and velvet, and had their carriages waiting for them at the\ndoor, gazed with astonishment and admiration at the luxury which they\nsaw before them.\n\nI was not long in discovering the reason of this astonishment and\nadmiration, for, having begun to examine things a little carefully, I\ndiscovered without difficulty that I was in the house of a kept woman.\nNow, if there is one thing which women in society would like to see (and\nthere were society women there), it is the home of those women whose\ncarriages splash their own carriages day by day, who, like them, side by\nside with them, have their boxes at the Opera and at the Italiens,\nand who parade in Paris the opulent insolence of their beauty, their\ndiamonds, and their scandal.\n\nThis one was dead, so the most virtuous of women could enter even her\nbedroom. Death had purified the air of this abode of splendid foulness,\nand if more excuse were needed, they had the excuse that they had merely\ncome to a sale, they knew not whose. They had read the placards, they\nwished to see what the placards had announced, and to make their choice\nbeforehand. What could be more natural? Yet, all the same, in the midst\nof all these beautiful things, they could not help looking about for\nsome traces of this courtesan's life, of which they had heard, no doubt,\nstrange enough stories.\n\nUnfortunately the mystery had vanished with the goddess, and, for\nall their endeavours, they discovered only what was on sale since\nthe owner's decease, and nothing of what had been on sale during her\nlifetime. For the rest, there were plenty of things worth buying. The\nfurniture was superb; there were rosewood and buhl cabinets and tables,\nSevres and Chinese vases, Saxe statuettes, satin, velvet, lace; there\nwas nothing lacking.\n\nI sauntered through the rooms, following the inquisitive ladies of\ndistinction. They entered a room with Persian hangings, and I was just\ngoing to enter in turn, when they came out again almost immediately,\nsmiling, and as if ashamed of their own curiosity. I was all the more\neager to see the room. It was the dressing-room, laid out with all the\narticles of toilet, in which the dead woman's extravagance seemed to be\nseen at its height.\n\nOn a large table against the wall, a table three feet in width and six\nin length, glittered all the treasures of Aucoc and Odiot. It was a\nmagnificent collection, and there was not one of those thousand little\nthings so necessary to the toilet of a woman of the kind which was not\nin gold or silver. Such a collection could only have been got together\nlittle by little, and the same lover had certainly not begun and ended\nit.\n\nNot being shocked at the sight of a kept woman's dressing-room, I\namused myself with examining every detail, and I discovered that these\nmagnificently chiselled objects bore different initials and different\ncoronets. I looked at one after another, each recalling a separate\nshame, and I said that God had been merciful to the poor child, in not\nhaving left her to pay the ordinary penalty, but rather to die in\nthe midst of her beauty and luxury, before the coming of old age, the\ncourtesan's first death.\n\nIs there anything sadder in the world than the old age of vice,\nespecially in woman? She preserves no dignity, she inspires no interest.\nThe everlasting repentance, not of the evil ways followed, but of the\nplans that have miscarried, the money that has been spent in vain, is\nas saddening a thing as one can well meet with. I knew an aged woman who\nhad once been \"gay,\" whose only link with the past was a daughter almost\nas beautiful as she herself had been. This poor creature to whom her\nmother had never said, \"You are my child,\" except to bid her nourish her\nold age as she herself had nourished her youth, was called Louise, and,\nbeing obedient to her mother, she abandoned herself without volition,\nwithout passion, without pleasure, as she would have worked at any other\nprofession that might have been taught her.\n\nThe constant sight of dissipation, precocious dissipation, in addition\nto her constant sickly state, had extinguished in her mind all the\nknowledge of good and evil that God had perhaps given her, but that no\none had ever thought of developing. I shall always remember her, as\nshe passed along the boulevards almost every day at the same hour,\naccompanied by her mother as assiduously as a real mother might have\naccompanied her daughter. I was very young then, and ready to accept for\nmyself the easy morality of the age. I remember, however, the\ncontempt and disgust which awoke in me at the sight of this scandalous\nchaperoning. Her face, too, was inexpressibly virginal in its expression\nof innocence and of melancholy suffering. She was like a figure of\nResignation.\n\nOne day the girl's face was transfigured. In the midst of all the\ndebauches mapped out by her mother, it seemed to her as if God had left\nover for her one happiness. And why indeed should God, who had made her\nwithout strength, have left her without consolation, under the sorrowful\nburden of her life? One day, then, she realized that she was to have a\nchild, and all that remained to her of chastity leaped for joy. The soul\nhas strange refuges. Louise ran to tell the good news to her mother.\nIt is a shameful thing to speak of, but we are not telling tales of\npleasant sins; we are telling of true facts, which it would be better,\nno doubt, to pass over in silence, if we did not believe that it is\nneedful from time to time to reveal the martyrdom of those who are\ncondemned without bearing, scorned without judging; shameful it is, but\nthis mother answered the daughter that they had already scarce enough\nfor two, and would certainly not have enough for three; that such\nchildren are useless, and a lying-in is so much time lost.\n\nNext day a midwife, of whom all we will say is that she was a friend of\nthe mother, visited Louise, who remained in bed for a few days, and then\ngot up paler and feebler than before.\n\nThree months afterward a man took pity on her and tried to heal her,\nmorally and physically; but the last shock had been too violent, and\nLouise died of it. The mother still lives; how? God knows.\n\nThis story returned to my mind while I looked at the silver toilet\nthings, and a certain space of time must have elapsed during these\nreflections, for no one was left in the room but myself and an\nattendant, who, standing near the door, was carefully watching me to see\nthat I did not pocket anything.\n\nI went up to the man, to whom I was causing so much anxiety. \"Sir,\" I\nsaid, \"can you tell me the name of the person who formerly lived here?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Marguerite Gautier.\"\n\nI knew her by name and by sight.\n\n\"What!\" I said to the attendant; \"Marguerite Gautier is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When did she die?\"\n\n\"Three weeks ago, I believe.\"\n\n\"And why are the rooms on view?\"\n\n\"The creditors believe that it will send up the prices. People can see\nbeforehand the effect of the things; you see that induces them to buy.\"\n\n\"She was in debt, then?\"\n\n\"To any extent, sir.\"\n\n\"But the sale will cover it?\"\n\n\"And more too.\"\n\n\"Who will get what remains over?\"\n\n\"Her family.\"\n\n\"She had a family?\"\n\n\"It seems so.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe attendant, reassured as to my intentions, touched his hat, and I\nwent out.\n\n\"Poor girl!\" I said to myself as I returned home; \"she must have had a\nsad death, for, in her world, one has friends only when one is perfectly\nwell.\" And in spite of myself I began to feel melancholy over the fate\nof Marguerite Gautier.\n\nIt will seem absurd to many people, but I have an unbounded sympathy\nfor women of this kind, and I do not think it necessary to apologize for\nsuch sympathy.\n\nOne day, as I was going to the Prefecture for a passport, I saw in one\nof the neighbouring streets a poor girl who was being marched along by\ntwo policemen. I do not know what was the matter. All I know is that she\nwas weeping bitterly as she kissed an infant only a few months old, from\nwhom her arrest was to separate her. Since that day I have never dared\nto despise a woman at first sight.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe sale was to take place on the 16th. A day's interval had been left\nbetween the visiting days and the sale, in order to give time for taking\ndown the hangings, curtains, etc. I had just returned from abroad. It\nwas natural that I had not heard of Marguerite's death among the pieces\nof news which one's friends always tell on returning after an absence.\nMarguerite was a pretty woman; but though the life of such women makes\nsensation enough, their death makes very little. They are suns which set\nas they rose, unobserved. Their death, when they die young, is heard\nof by all their lovers at the same moment, for in Paris almost all\nthe lovers of a well-known woman are friends. A few recollections are\nexchanged, and everybody's life goes on as if the incident had never\noccurred, without so much as a tear.\n\nNowadays, at twenty-five, tears have become so rare a thing that they\nare not to be squandered indiscriminately. It is the most that can be\nexpected if the parents who pay for being wept over are wept over in\nreturn for the price they pay.\n\nAs for me, though my initials did not occur on any of Marguerite's\nbelongings, that instinctive indulgence, that natural pity that I have\nalready confessed, set me thinking over her death, more perhaps than it\nwas worth thinking over. I remembered having often met Marguerite in the\nBois, where she went regularly every day in a little blue coupe drawn by\ntwo magnificent bays, and I had noticed in her a distinction quite apart\nfrom other women of her kind, a distinction which was enhanced by a\nreally exceptional beauty.\n\nThese unfortunate creatures whenever they go out are always accompanied\nby somebody or other. As no man cares to make himself conspicuous by\nbeing seen in their company, and as they are afraid of solitude, they\ntake with them either those who are not well enough off to have a\ncarriage, or one or another of those elegant, ancient ladies, whose\nelegance is a little inexplicable, and to whom one can always go for\ninformation in regard to the women whom they accompany.\n\nIn Marguerite's case it was quite different. She was always alone when\nshe drove in the Champs-Elysees, lying back in her carriage as much as\npossible, dressed in furs in winter, and in summer wearing very simple\ndresses; and though she often passed people whom she knew, her smile,\nwhen she chose to smile, was seen only by them, and a duchess might\nhave smiled in just such a manner. She did not drive to and fro like the\nothers, from the Rond-Point to the end of the Champs-Elysees. She drove\nstraight to the Bois. There she left her carriage, walked for an hour,\nreturned to her carriage, and drove rapidly home.\n\nAll these circumstances which I had so often witnessed came back to my\nmemory, and I regretted her death as one might regret the destruction of\na beautiful work of art.\n\nIt was impossible to see more charm in beauty than in that of\nMarguerite. Excessively tall and thin, she had in the fullest degree the\nart of repairing this oversight of Nature by the mere arrangement of the\nthings she wore. Her cashmere reached to the ground, and showed on each\nside the large flounces of a silk dress, and the heavy muff which she\nheld pressed against her bosom was surrounded by such cunningly arranged\nfolds that the eye, however exacting, could find no fault with the\ncontour of the lines. Her head, a marvel, was the object of the most\ncoquettish care. It was small, and her mother, as Musset would say,\nseemed to have made it so in order to make it with care.\n\nSet, in an oval of indescribable grace, two black eyes, surmounted by\neyebrows of so pure a curve that it seemed as if painted; veil these\neyes with lovely lashes, which, when drooped, cast their shadow on the\nrosy hue of the cheeks; trace a delicate, straight nose, the nostrils\na little open, in an ardent aspiration toward the life of the senses;\ndesign a regular mouth, with lips parted graciously over teeth as white\nas milk; colour the skin with the down of a peach that no hand\nhas touched, and you will have the general aspect of that charming\ncountenance. The hair, black as jet, waving naturally or not, was\nparted on the forehead in two large folds and draped back over the head,\nleaving in sight just the tip of the ears, in which there glittered two\ndiamonds, worth four to five thousand francs each. How it was that her\nardent life had left on Marguerite's face the virginal, almost childlike\nexpression, which characterized it, is a problem which we can but state,\nwithout attempting to solve it.\n\nMarguerite had a marvellous portrait of herself, by Vidal, the only man\nwhose pencil could do her justice. I had this portrait by me for a few\ndays after her death, and the likeness was so astonishing that it has\nhelped to refresh my memory in regard to some points which I might not\notherwise have remembered.\n\nSome among the details of this chapter did not reach me until later,\nbut I write them here so as not to be obliged to return to them when the\nstory itself has begun.\n\nMarguerite was always present at every first night, and passed every\nevening either at the theatre or the ball. Whenever there was a new\npiece she was certain to be seen, and she invariably had three things\nwith her on the ledge of her ground-floor box: her opera-glass, a bag of\nsweets, and a bouquet of camellias.\n\nFor twenty-five days of the month the camellias were white, and for five\nthey were red; no one ever knew the reason of this change of colour,\nwhich I mention though I can not explain it; it was noticed both by her\nfriends and by the habitue's of the theatres to which she most often\nwent. She was never seen with any flowers but camellias. At the\nflorist's, Madame Barjon's, she had come to be called \"the Lady of the\nCamellias,\" and the name stuck to her.\n\nLike all those who move in a certain set in Paris, I knew that\nMarguerite had lived with some of the most fashionable young men in\nsociety, that she spoke of it openly, and that they themselves\nboasted of it; so that all seemed equally pleased with one another.\nNevertheless, for about three years, after a visit to Bagnees, she was\nsaid to be living with an old duke, a foreigner, enormously rich, who\nhad tried to remove her as far as possible from her former life, and, as\nit seemed, entirely to her own satisfaction.\n\nThis is what I was told on the subject. In the spring of 1847 Marguerite\nwas so ill that the doctors ordered her to take the waters, and she went\nto Bagneres. Among the invalids was the daughter of this duke; she\nwas not only suffering from the same complaint, but she was so like\nMarguerite in appearance that they might have been taken for sisters;\nthe young duchess was in the last stage of consumption, and a few days\nafter Marguerite's arrival she died. One morning, the duke, who had\nremained at Bagneres to be near the soil that had buried a part of his\nheart, caught sight of Marguerite at a turn of the road. He seemed to\nsee the shadow of his child, and going up to her, he took her hands,\nembraced and wept over her, and without even asking her who she was,\nbegged her to let him love in her the living image of his dead child.\nMarguerite, alone at Bagneres with her maid, and not being in any fear\nof compromising herself, granted the duke's request. Some people who\nknew her, happening to be at Bagneres, took upon themselves to explain\nMademoiselle Gautier's true position to the duke. It was a blow to\nthe old man, for the resemblance with his daughter was ended in one\ndirection, but it was too late. She had become a necessity to his heart,\nhis only pretext, his only excuse, for living. He made no reproaches,\nhe had indeed no right to do so, but he asked her if she felt herself\ncapable of changing her mode of life, offering her in return for the\nsacrifice every compensation that she could desire. She consented.\n\nIt must be said that Marguerite was just then very ill. The past seemed\nto her sensitive nature as if it were one of the main causes of her\nillness, and a sort of superstition led her to hope that God would\nrestore to her both health and beauty in return for her repentance and\nconversion. By the end of the summer, the waters, sleep, the natural\nfatigue of long walks, had indeed more or less restored her health. The\nduke accompanied her to Paris, where he continued to see her as he had\ndone at Bagneres.\n\nThis liaison, whose motive and origin were quite unknown, caused a great\nsensation, for the duke, already known for his immense fortune,\nnow became known for his prodigality. All this was set down to the\ndebauchery of a rich old man, and everything was believed except the\ntruth. The father's sentiment for Marguerite had, in truth, so pure a\ncause that anything but a communion of hearts would have seemed to him a\nkind of incest, and he had never spoken to her a word which his daughter\nmight not have heard.\n\nFar be it from me to make out our heroine to be anything but what she\nwas. As long as she remained at Bagneres, the promise she had made to\nthe duke had not been hard to keep, and she had kept it; but, once back\nin Paris, it seemed to her, accustomed to a life of dissipation, of\nballs, of orgies, as if the solitude, only interrupted by the duke's\nstated visits, would kill her with boredom, and the hot breath of her\nold life came back across her head and heart.\n\nWe must add that Marguerite had returned more beautiful than she had\never been; she was but twenty, and her malady, sleeping but not subdued,\ncontinued to give her those feverish desires which are almost always the\nresult of diseases of the chest.\n\nIt was a great grief to the duke when his friends, always on the lookout\nfor some scandal on the part of the woman with whom, it seemed to them,\nhe was compromising himself, came to tell him, indeed to prove to him,\nthat at times when she was sure of not seeing him she received other\nvisits, and that these visits were often prolonged till the following\nday. On being questioned, Marguerite admitted everything to the duke,\nand advised him, without arriere-pensee, to concern himself with her no\nlonger, for she felt incapable of carrying out what she had undertaken,\nand she did not wish to go on accepting benefits from a man whom she was\ndeceiving. The duke did not return for a week; it was all he could do,\nand on the eighth day he came to beg Marguerite to let him still visit\nher, promising that he would take her as she was, so long as he might\nsee her, and swearing that he would never utter a reproach against her,\nnot though he were to die of it.\n\nThis, then, was the state of things three months after Marguerite's\nreturn; that is to say, in November or December, 1842.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nAt one o'clock on the 16th I went to the Rue d'Antin. The voice of the\nauctioneer could be heard from the outer door. The rooms were crowded\nwith people. There were all the celebrities of the most elegant\nimpropriety, furtively examined by certain great ladies who had again\nseized the opportunity of the sale in order to be able to see, close at\nhand, women whom they might never have another occasion of meeting, and\nwhom they envied perhaps in secret for their easy pleasures. The Duchess\nof F. elbowed Mlle. A., one of the most melancholy examples of our\nmodern courtesan; the Marquis de T. hesitated over a piece of furniture\nthe price of which was being run high by Mme. D., the most elegant and\nfamous adulteress of our time; the Duke of Y., who in Madrid is supposed\nto be ruining himself in Paris, and in Paris to be ruining himself in\nMadrid, and who, as a matter of fact, never even reaches the limit of\nhis income, talked with Mme. M., one of our wittiest story-tellers, who\nfrom time to time writes what she says and signs what she writes, while\nat the same time he exchanged confidential glances with Mme. de N., a\nfair ornament of the Champs-Elysees, almost always dressed in pink\nor blue, and driving two big black horses which Tony had sold her for\n10,000 francs, and for which she had paid, after her fashion; finally,\nMlle. R., who makes by her mere talent twice what the women of the world\nmake by their dot and three times as much as the others make by their\namours, had come, in spite of the cold, to make some purchases, and was\nnot the least looked at among the crowd.\n\nWe might cite the initials of many more of those who found themselves,\nnot without some mutual surprise, side by side in one room. But we fear\nto weary the reader. We will only add that everyone was in the highest\nspirits, and that many of those present had known the dead woman, and\nseemed quite oblivious of the fact. There was a sound of loud laughter;\nthe auctioneers shouted at the top of their voices; the dealers who had\nfilled the benches in front of the auction table tried in vain to obtain\nsilence, in order to transact their business in peace. Never was there a\nnoisier or a more varied gathering.\n\nI slipped quietly into the midst of this tumult, sad to think of when\none remembered that the poor creature whose goods were being sold to pay\nher debts had died in the next room. Having come rather to examine than\nto buy, I watched the faces of the auctioneers, noticing how they\nbeamed with delight whenever anything reached a price beyond their\nexpectations. Honest creatures, who had speculated upon this woman's\nprostitution, who had gained their hundred per cent out of her, who had\nplagued with their writs the last moments of her life, and who came now\nafter her death to gather in at once the fruits of their dishonourable\ncalculations and the interest on their shameful credit, How wise were\nthe ancients in having only one God for traders and robbers!\n\nDresses, cashmeres, jewels, were sold with incredible rapidity. There\nwas nothing that I cared for, and I still waited. All at once I heard:\n\"A volume, beautifully bound, gilt-edged, entitled Manon Lescaut. There\nis something written on the first page. Ten francs.\"\n\n\"Twelve,\" said a voice after a longish silence.\n\n\"Fifteen,\" I said.\n\nWhy? I did not know. Doubtless for the something written.\n\n\"Fifteen,\" repeated the auctioneer.\n\n\"Thirty,\" said the first bidder in a tone which seemed to defy further\ncompetition.\n\nIt had now become a struggle. \"Thirty-five,\" I cried in the same tone.\n\n\"Forty.\"\n\n\"Fifty.\"\n\n\"Sixty.\"\n\n\"A hundred.\"\n\nIf I had wished to make a sensation I should certainly have succeeded,\nfor a profound silence had ensued, and people gazed at me as if to see\nwhat sort of a person it was, who seemed to be so determined to possess\nthe volume.\n\nThe accent which I had given to my last word seemed to convince my\nadversary; he preferred to abandon a conflict which could only have\nresulted in making me pay ten times its price for the volume, and,\nbowing, he said very gracefully, though indeed a little late:\n\n\"I give way, sir.\"\n\nNothing more being offered, the book was assigned to me.\n\nAs I was afraid of some new fit of obstinacy, which my amour propre\nmight have sustained somewhat better than my purse, I wrote down my\nname, had the book put on one side, and went out. I must have given\nconsiderable food for reflection to the witnesses of this scene, who\nwould no doubt ask themselves what my purpose could have been in paying\na hundred francs for a book which I could have had anywhere for ten, or,\nat the outside, fifteen.\n\nAn hour after, I sent for my purchase. On the first page was written\nin ink, in an elegant hand, an inscription on the part of the giver. It\nconsisted of these words:\n\nManon to Marguerite.\n\nHumility.\n\nIt was signed Armand Duval.\n\nWhat was the meaning of the word Humility? Was Manon to recognise in\nMarguerite, in the opinion of M. Armand Duval, her superior in vice or\nin affection? The second interpretation seemed the more probable, for\nthe first would have been an impertinent piece of plain speaking which\nMarguerite, whatever her opinion of herself, would never have accepted.\n\nI went out again, and thought no more of the book until at night, when I\nwas going to bed.\n\nManon Lescaut is a touching story. I know every detail of it, and yet\nwhenever I come across the volume the same sympathy always draws me to\nit; I open it, and for the hundredth time I live over again with the\nheroine of the Abbe Prevost. Now this heroine is so true to life that I\nfeel as if I had known her; and thus the sort of comparison between\nher and Marguerite gave me an unusual inclination to read it, and my\nindulgence passed into pity, almost into a kind of love for the poor\ngirl to whom I owed the volume. Manon died in the desert, it is true,\nbut in the arms of the man who loved her with the whole energy of his\nsoul; who, when she was dead, dug a grave for her, and watered it with\nhis tears, and buried his heart in it; while Marguerite, a sinner like\nManon, and perhaps converted like her, had died in a sumptuous bed (it\nseemed, after what I had seen, the bed of her past), but in that desert\nof the heart, a more barren, a vaster, a more pitiless desert than that\nin which Manon had found her last resting-place.\n\nMarguerite, in fact, as I had found from some friends who knew of the\nlast circumstances of her life, had not a single real friend by her\nbedside during the two months of her long and painful agony.\n\nThen from Manon and Marguerite my mind wandered to those whom I knew,\nand whom I saw singing along the way which led to just such another\ndeath. Poor souls! if it is not right to love them, is it not well to\npity them? You pity the blind man who has never seen the daylight, the\ndeaf who has never heard the harmonies of nature, the dumb who has never\nfound a voice for his soul, and, under a false cloak of shame, you will\nnot pity this blindness of heart, this deafness of soul, this dumbness\nof conscience, which sets the poor afflicted creature beside herself\nand makes her, in spite of herself, incapable of seeing what is good, of\nbearing the Lord, and of speaking the pure language of love and faith.\n\nHugo has written Marion Delorme, Musset has written Bernerette,\nAlexandre Dumas has written Fernande, the thinkers and poets of all time\nhave brought to the courtesan the offering of their pity, and at times\na great man has rehabilitated them with his love and even with his name.\nIf I insist on this point, it is because many among those who have begun\nto read me will be ready to throw down a book in which they will fear to\nfind an apology for vice and prostitution; and the author's age will do\nsomething, no doubt, to increase this fear. Let me undeceive those\nwho think thus, and let them go on reading, if nothing but such a fear\nhinders them.\n\nI am quite simply convinced of a certain principle, which is: For the\nwoman whose education has not taught her what is right, God almost\nalways opens two ways which lead thither the ways of sorrow and of love.\nThey are hard; those who walk in them walk with bleeding feet and torn\nhands, but they also leave the trappings of vice upon the thorns of\nthe wayside, and reach the journey's end in a nakedness which is not\nshameful in the sight of the Lord.\n\nThose who meet these bold travellers ought to succour them, and to tell\nall that they have met them, for in so doing they point out the way. It\nis not a question of setting at the outset of life two sign-posts, one\nbearing the inscription \"The Right Way,\" the other the inscription \"The\nWrong Way,\" and of saying to those who come there, \"Choose.\" One must\nneeds, like Christ, point out the ways which lead from the second\nroad to the first, to those who have been easily led astray; and it is\nneedful that the beginning of these ways should not be too painful nor\nappear too impenetrable.\n\nHere is Christianity with its marvellous parable of the Prodigal Son to\nteach us indulgence and pardon. Jesus was full of love for souls wounded\nby the passions of men; he loved to bind up their wounds and to find in\nthose very wounds the balm which should heal them. Thus he said to the\nMagdalen: \"Much shall be forgiven thee because thou hast loved much,\" a\nsublimity of pardon which can only have called forth a sublime faith.\n\nWhy do we make ourselves more strict than Christ? Why, holding\nobstinately to the opinions of the world, which hardens itself in\norder that it may be thought strong, do we reject, as it rejects, souls\nbleeding at wounds by which, like a sick man's bad blood, the evil of\ntheir past may be healed, if only a friendly hand is stretched out to\nlave them and set them in the convalescence of the heart?\n\nIt is to my own generation that I speak, to those for whom the theories\nof M. de Voltaire happily exist no longer, to those who, like myself,\nrealize that humanity, for these last fifteen years, has been in one of\nits most audacious moments of expansion. The science of good and evil\nis acquired forever; faith is refashioned, respect for sacred things has\nreturned to us, and if the world has not all at once become good, it has\nat least become better. The efforts of every intelligent man tend in\nthe same direction, and every strong will is harnessed to the same\nprinciple: Be good, be young, be true! Evil is nothing but vanity, let\nus have the pride of good, and above all let us never despair. Do not\nlet us despise the woman who is neither mother, sister, maid, nor wife.\nDo not let us limit esteem to the family nor indulgence to egoism. Since\n\"there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over\nninety and nine just persons that need no repentance,\" let us give joy\nto heaven. Heaven will render it back to us with usury. Let us leave on\nour way the alms of pardon for those whom earthly desires have driven\nastray, whom a divine hope shall perhaps save, and, as old women say\nwhen they offer you some homely remedy of their own, if it does no good\nit will do no harm.\n\nDoubtless it must seem a bold thing to attempt to deduce these grand\nresults out of the meagre subject that I deal with; but I am one of\nthose who believe that all is in little. The child is small, and he\nincludes the man; the brain is narrow, and it harbours thought; the eye\nis but a point, and it covers leagues.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nTwo days after, the sale was ended. It had produced 3.50,000 francs. The\ncreditors divided among them two thirds, and the family, a sister and a\ngrand-nephew, received the remainder.\n\nThe sister opened her eyes very wide when the lawyer wrote to her that\nshe had inherited 50,000 francs. The girl had not seen her sister for\nsix or seven years, and did not know what had become of her from the\nmoment when she had disappeared from home. She came up to Paris in\nhaste, and great was the astonishment of those who had known Marguerite\nwhen they saw as her only heir a fine, fat country girl, who until then\nhad never left her village. She had made the fortune at a single stroke,\nwithout even knowing the source of that fortune. She went back, I heard\nafterward, to her countryside, greatly saddened by her sister's death,\nbut with a sadness which was somewhat lightened by the investment at\nfour and a half per cent which she had been able to make.\n\nAll these circumstances, often repeated in Paris, the mother city of\nscandal, had begun to be forgotten, and I was even little by little\nforgetting the part I had taken in them, when a new incident brought to\nmy knowledge the whole of Marguerite's life, and acquainted me with\nsuch pathetic details that I was taken with the idea of writing down the\nstory which I now write.\n\nThe rooms, now emptied of all their furniture, had been to let for three\nor four days when one morning there was a ring at my door.\n\nMy servant, or, rather, my porter, who acted as my servant, went to the\ndoor and brought me a card, saying that the person who had given it to\nhim wished to see me.\n\nI glanced at the card and there read these two words: Armand Duval.\n\nI tried to think where I had seen the name, and remembered the first\nleaf of the copy of Manon Lescaut. What could the person who had given\nthe book to Marguerite want of me? I gave orders to ask him in at once.\n\nI saw a young man, blond, tall, pale, dressed in a travelling suit which\nlooked as if he had not changed it for some days, and had not even taken\nthe trouble to brush it on arriving at Paris, for it was covered with\ndust.\n\nM. Duval was deeply agitated; he made no attempt to conceal his\nagitation, and it was with tears in his eyes and a trembling voice that\nhe said to me:\n\n\"Sir, I beg you to excuse my visit and my costume; but young people are\nnot very ceremonious with one another, and I was so anxious to see you\nto-day that I have not even gone to the hotel to which I have sent my\nluggage, and have rushed straight here, fearing that, after all, I might\nmiss you, early as it is.\"\n\nI begged M. Duval to sit down by the fire; he did so, and, taking his\nhandkerchief from his pocket, hid his face in it for a moment.\n\n\"You must be at a loss to understand,\" he went on, sighing sadly, \"for\nwhat purpose an unknown visitor, at such an hour, in such a costume, and\nin tears, can have come to see you. I have simply come to ask of you a\ngreat service.\"\n\n\"Speak on, sir, I am entirely at your disposal.\"\n\n\"You were present at the sale of Marguerite Gautier?\"\n\nAt this word the emotion, which he had got the better of for an instant,\nwas too much for him, and he was obliged to cover his eyes with his\nhand.\n\n\"I must seem to you very absurd,\" he added, \"but pardon me, and believe\nthat I shall never forget the patience with which you have listened to\nme.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I answered, \"if the service which I can render you is able to\nlessen your trouble a little, tell me at once what I can do for you, and\nyou will find me only too happy to oblige you.\"\n\nM. Duval's sorrow was sympathetic, and in spite of myself I felt the\ndesire of doing him a kindness. Thereupon he said to me:\n\n\"You bought something at Marguerite's sale?\"\n\n\"Yes, a book.\"\n\n\"Manon Lescaut?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Have you the book still?\"\n\n\"It is in my bedroom.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Armand Duval seemed to be relieved of a great weight,\nand thanked me as if I had already rendered him a service merely by\nkeeping the book.\n\nI got up and went into my room to fetch the book, which I handed to him.\n\n\"That is it indeed,\" he said, looking at the inscription on the first\npage and turning over the leaves; \"that is it in deed,\" and two big\ntears fell on the pages. \"Well, sir,\" said he, lifting his head, and no\nlonger trying to hide from me that he had wept and was even then on the\npoint of weeping, \"do you value this book very greatly?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I have come to ask you to give it up to me.\"\n\n\"Pardon my curiosity, but was it you, then, who gave it to Marguerite\nGautier?\"\n\n\"It was!\"\n\n\"The book is yours, sir; take it back. I am happy to be able to hand it\nover to you.\"\n\n\"But,\" said M. Duval with some embarrassment, \"the least I can do is to\ngive you in return the price which you paid for it.\"\n\n\"Allow me to offer it to you. The price of a single volume in a sale of\nthat kind is a mere nothing, and I do not remember how much I gave for\nit.\"\n\n\"You gave one hundred francs.\"\n\n\"True,\" I said, embarrassed in my turn, \"how do you know?\"\n\n\"It is quite simple. I hoped to reach Paris in time for the sale, and I\nonly managed to get here this morning. I was absolutely resolved to have\nsomething which had belonged to her, and I hastened to the auctioneer\nand asked him to allow me to see the list of the things sold and of\nthe buyers' names. I saw that this volume had been bought by you, and\nI decided to ask you to give it up to me, though the price you had\nset upon it made me fear that you might yourself have some souvenir in\nconnection with the possession of the book.\"\n\nAs he spoke, it was evident that he was afraid I had known Marguerite as\nhe had known her. I hastened to reassure him.\n\n\"I knew Mlle. Gautier only by sight,\" I said; \"her death made on me the\nimpression that the death of a pretty woman must always make on a young\nman who had liked seeing her. I wished to buy something at her sale, and\nI bid higher and higher for this book out of mere obstinacy and to annoy\nsomeone else, who was equally keen to obtain it, and who seemed to defy\nme to the contest. I repeat, then, that the book is yours, and once more\nI beg you to accept it; do not treat me as if I were an auctioneer,\nand let it be the pledge between us of a longer and more intimate\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Armand, holding out his hand and pressing mine; \"I accept,\nand I shall be grateful to you all my life.\"\n\nI was very anxious to question Armand on the subject of Marguerite, for\nthe inscription in the book, the young man's hurried journey, his desire\nto possess the volume, piqued my curiosity; but I feared if I questioned\nmy visitor that I might seem to have refused his money only in order to\nhave the right to pry into his affairs.\n\nIt was as if he guessed my desire, for he said to me:\n\n\"Have you read the volume?\"\n\n\"All through.\"\n\n\"What did you think of the two lines that I wrote in it?\"\n\n\"I realized at once that the woman to whom you had given the volume\nmust have been quite outside the ordinary category, for I could not take\nthose two lines as a mere empty compliment.\"\n\n\"You were right. That woman was an angel. See, read this letter.\" And he\nhanded to me a paper which seemed to have been many times reread.\n\nI opened it, and this is what it contained:\n\n\"MY DEAR ARMAND:--I have received your letter. You are still good, and\nI thank God for it. Yes, my friend, I am ill, and with one of those\ndiseases that never relent; but the interest you still take in me makes\nmy suffering less. I shall not live long enough, I expect, to have the\nhappiness of pressing the hand which has written the kind letter I have\njust received; the words of it would be enough to cure me, if anything\ncould cure me. I shall not see you, for I am quite near death, and you\nare hundreds of leagues away. My poor friend! your Marguerite of old\ntimes is sadly changed. It is better perhaps for you not to see her\nagain than to see her as she is. You ask if I forgive you; oh, with all\nmy heart, friend, for the way you hurt me was only a way of proving the\nlove you had for me. I have been in bed for a month, and I think so much\nof your esteem that I write every day the journal of my life, from the\nmoment we left each other to the moment when I shall be able to write\nno longer. If the interest you take in me is real, Armand, when you come\nback go and see Julie Duprat. She will give you my journal. You will\nfind in it the reason and the excuse for what has passed between us.\nJulie is very good to me; we often talk of you together. She was there\nwhen your letter came, and we both cried over it.\n\n\"If you had not sent me any word, I had told her to give you those\npapers when you returned to France. Do not thank me for it. This daily\nlooking back on the only happy moments of my life does me an immense\namount of good, and if you will find in reading it some excuse for the\npast. I, for my part, find a continual solace in it. I should like to\nleave you something which would always remind you of me, but everything\nhere has been seized, and I have nothing of my own.\n\n\"Do you understand, my friend? I am dying, and from my bed I can hear\na man walking to and fro in the drawing-room; my creditors have put him\nthere to see that nothing is taken away, and that nothing remains to\nme in case I do not die. I hope they will wait till the end before they\nbegin to sell.\n\n\"Oh, men have no pity! or rather, I am wrong, it is God who is just and\ninflexible!\n\n\"And now, dear love, you will come to my sale, and you will buy\nsomething, for if I put aside the least thing for you, they might accuse\nyou of embezzling seized goods.\n\n\"It is a sad life that I am leaving!\n\n\"It would be good of God to let me see you again before I die. According\nto all probability, good-bye, my friend. Pardon me if I do not write a\nlonger letter, but those who say they are going to cure me wear me out\nwith bloodletting, and my hand refuses to write any more.\n\n\"MARGUERITE GAUTIER.\"\n\n\nThe last two words were scarcely legible. I returned the letter to\nArmand, who had, no doubt, read it over again in his mind while I was\nreading it on paper, for he said to me as he took it:\n\n\"Who would think that a kept woman could have written that?\" And,\novercome by recollections, he gazed for some time at the writing of the\nletter, which he finally carried to his lips.\n\n\"And when I think,\" he went on, \"that she died before I could see her,\nand that I shall never see her again, when I think that she did for me\nwhat no sister would ever have done, I can not forgive myself for having\nleft her to die like that. Dead! Dead and thinking of me, writing and\nrepeating my name, poor dear Marguerite!\"\n\nAnd Armand, giving free outlet to his thoughts and his tears, held out\nhis hand to me, and continued:\n\n\"People would think it childish enough if they saw me lament like this\nover a dead woman such as she; no one will ever know what I made that\nwoman suffer, how cruel I have been to her! how good, how resigned\nshe was! I thought it was I who had to forgive her, and to-day I feel\nunworthy of the forgiveness which she grants me. Oh, I would give ten\nyears of my life to weep at her feet for an hour!\"\n\nIt is always difficult to console a sorrow that is unknown to one, and\nnevertheless I felt so lively a sympathy for the young man, he made me\nso frankly the confidant of his distress, that I believed a word from me\nwould not be indifferent to him, and I said:\n\n\"Have you no parents, no friends? Hope. Go and see them; they will\nconsole you. As for me, I can only pity you.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" he said, rising and walking to and fro in the room, \"I\nam wearying you. Pardon me, I did not reflect how little my sorrow must\nmean to you, and that I am intruding upon you something which can not\nand ought not to interest you at all.\"\n\n\"You mistake my meaning. I am entirely at your service; only I regret\nmy inability to calm your distress. If my society and that of my friends\ncan give you any distraction, if, in short, you have need of me, no\nmatter in what way, I hope you will realize how much pleasure it will\ngive me to do anything for you.\"\n\n\"Pardon, pardon,\" said he; \"sorrow sharpens the sensations. Let me stay\nhere for a few minutes longer, long enough to dry my eyes, so that the\nidlers in the street may not look upon it as a curiosity to see a big\nfellow like me crying. You have made me very happy by giving me this\nbook. I do not know how I can ever express my gratitude to you.\"\n\n\"By giving me a little of your friendship,\" said I, \"and by telling me\nthe cause of your suffering. One feels better while telling what one\nsuffers.\"\n\n\"You are right. But to-day I have too much need of tears; I can not very\nwell talk. One day I will tell you the whole story, and you will see if\nI have reason for regretting the poor girl. And now,\" he added, rubbing\nhis eyes for the last time, and looking at himself in the glass, \"say\nthat you do not think me too absolutely idiotic, and allow me to come\nback and see you another time.\"\n\nHe cast on me a gentle and amiable look. I was near embracing him.\nAs for him, his eyes again began to fill with tears; he saw that I\nperceived it and turned away his head.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, \"courage.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said.\n\nAnd, making a desperate effort to restrain his tears, he rushed rather\nthan went out of the room.\n\nI lifted the curtain of my window, and saw him get into the cabriolet\nwhich awaited him at the door; but scarcely was he seated before he\nburst into tears and hid his face in his pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nA good while elapsed before I heard anything more of Armand, but, on the\nother hand, I was constantly hearing of Marguerite.\n\nI do not know if you have noticed, if once the name of anybody who might\nin the natural course of things have always remained unknown, or at all\nevents indifferent to you, should be mentioned before you, immediately\ndetails begin to group themselves about the name, and you find all your\nfriends talking to you about something which they have never mentioned\nto you before. You discover that this person was almost touching you and\nhas passed close to you many times in your life without your noticing\nit; you find coincidences in the events which are told you, a real\naffinity with certain events of your own existence. I was not absolutely\nat that point in regard to Marguerite, for I had seen and met her, I\nknew her by sight and by reputation; nevertheless, since the moment\nof the sale, her name came to my ears so frequently, and, owing to the\ncircumstance that I have mentioned in the last chapter, that name was\nassociated with so profound a sorrow, that my curiosity increased in\nproportion with my astonishment. The consequence was that whenever I met\nfriends to whom I had never breathed the name of Marguerite, I always\nbegan by saying:\n\n\"Did you ever know a certain Marguerite Gautier?\"\n\n\"The Lady of the Camellias?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well!\"\n\nThe word was sometimes accompanied by a smile which could leave no doubt\nas to its meaning.\n\n\"Well, what sort of a girl was she?\"\n\n\"A good sort of girl.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; more intelligence and perhaps a little more heart than most.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything particular about her?\"\n\n\"She ruined Baron de G.\"\n\n\"No more than that?\"\n\n\"She was the mistress of the old Duke of...\"\n\n\"Was she really his mistress?\"\n\n\"So they say; at all events, he gave her a great deal of money.\"\n\nThe general outlines were always the same. Nevertheless I was anxious\nto find out something about the relations between Marguerite and Armand.\nMeeting one day a man who was constantly about with known women, I asked\nhim: \"Did you know Marguerite Gautier?\"\n\nThe answer was the usual: \"Very well.\"\n\n\"What sort of a girl was she?\"\n\n\"A fine, good girl. I was very sorry to hear of her death.\"\n\n\"Had she not a lover called Armand Duval?\"\n\n\"Tall and blond?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"It is quite true.\"\n\n\"Who was this Armand?\"\n\n\"A fellow who squandered on her the little money he had, and then had to\nleave her. They say he was quite wild about it.\"\n\n\"And she?\"\n\n\"They always say she was very much in love with him, but as girls like\nthat are in love. It is no good to ask them for what they can not give.\"\n\n\"What has become of Armand?\"\n\n\"I don't know. We knew him very little. He was with Marguerite for five\nor six months in the country. When she came back, he had gone.\"\n\n\"And you have never seen him since?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nI, too, had not seen Armand again. I was beginning to ask myself if,\nwhen he had come to see me, the recent news of Marguerite's death had\nnot exaggerated his former love, and consequently his sorrow, and I\nsaid to myself that perhaps he had already forgotten the dead woman, and\nalong with her his promise to come and see me again. This supposition\nwould have seemed probable enough in most instances, but in Armand's\ndespair there had been an accent of real sincerity, and, going from one\nextreme to another, I imagined that distress had brought on an illness,\nand that my not seeing him was explained by the fact that he was ill,\nperhaps dead.\n\nI was interested in the young man in spite of myself. Perhaps there was\nsome selfishness in this interest; perhaps I guessed at some pathetic\nlove story under all this sorrow; perhaps my desire to know all about it\nhad much to do with the anxiety which Armand's silence caused me.\nSince M. Duval did not return to see me, I decided to go and see him. A\npretext was not difficult to find; unluckily I did not know his address,\nand no one among those whom I questioned could give it to me.\n\nI went to the Rue d'Antin; perhaps Marguerite's porter would know where\nArmand lived. There was a new porter; he knew as little about it as I.\nI then asked in what cemetery Mlle. Gautier had been buried. It was\nthe Montmartre Cemetery. It was now the month of April; the weather was\nfine, the graves were not likely to look as sad and desolate as they do\nin winter; in short, it was warm enough for the living to think a little\nof the dead, and pay them a visit. I went to the cemetery, saying to\nmyself: \"One glance at Marguerite's grave, and I shall know if Armand's\nsorrow still exists, and perhaps I may find out what has become of him.\"\n\nI entered the keeper's lodge, and asked him if on the 22nd of February\na woman named Marguerite Gautier had not been buried in the Montmartre\nCemetery. He turned over the pages of a big book in which those who\nenter this last resting-place are inscribed and numbered, and replied\nthat on the 22nd of February, at 12 o'clock, a woman of that name had\nbeen buried.\n\nI asked him to show me the grave, for there is no finding one's way\nwithout a guide in this city of the dead, which has its streets like a\ncity of the living. The keeper called over a gardener, to whom he gave\nthe necessary instructions; the gardener interrupted him, saying:\n\"I know, I know.--It is not difficult to find that grave,\" he added,\nturning to me.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it has very different flowers from the others.\"\n\n\"Is it you who look after it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and I wish all relations took as much trouble about the dead\nas the young man who gave me my orders.\"\n\nAfter several turnings, the gardener stopped and said to me: \"Here we\nare.\"\n\nI saw before me a square of flowers which one would never have taken for\na grave, if it had not been for a white marble slab bearing a name.\n\nThe marble slab stood upright, an iron railing marked the limits of the\nground purchased, and the earth was covered with white camellias. \"What\ndo you say to that?\" said the gardener.\n\n\"It is beautiful.\"\n\n\"And whenever a camellia fades, I have orders to replace it.\"\n\n\"Who gave you the order?\"\n\n\"A young gentleman, who cried the first time he came here; an old pal\nof hers, I suppose, for they say she was a gay one. Very pretty, too, I\nbelieve. Did you know her, sir?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Like the other?\" said the gardener, with a knowing smile. \"No, I never\nspoke to her.\"\n\n\"And you come here, too! It is very good of you, for those that come to\nsee the poor girl don't exactly cumber the cemetery.\"\n\n\"Doesn't anybody come?\"\n\n\"Nobody, except that young gentleman who came once.\"\n\n\"Only once?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"He never came back again?\"\n\n\"No, but he will when he gets home.\"\n\n\"He is away somewhere?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"I believe he has gone to see Mlle. Gautier's sister.\"\n\n\"What does he want there?\"\n\n\"He has gone to get her authority to have the corpse dug up again and\nput somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Why won't he let it remain here?\"\n\n\"You know, sir, people have queer notions about dead folk. We see\nsomething of that every day. The ground here was only bought for five\nyears, and this young gentleman wants a perpetual lease and a bigger\nplot of ground; it will be better in the new part.\"\n\n\"What do you call the new part?\"\n\n\"The new plots of ground that are for sale, there to the left. If the\ncemetery had always been kept like it is now, there wouldn't be the like\nof it in the world; but there is still plenty to do before it will be\nquite all it should be. And then people are so queer!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that there are people who carry their pride even here. Now, this\nDemoiselle Gautier, it appears she lived a bit free, if you'll excuse my\nsaying so. Poor lady, she's dead now; there's no more of her left than\nof them that no one has a word to say against. We water them every day.\nWell, when the relatives of the folk that are buried beside her found\nout the sort of person she was, what do you think they said? That they\nwould try to keep her out from here, and that there ought to be a piece\nof ground somewhere apart for these sort of women, like there is for the\npoor. Did you ever hear of such a thing? I gave it to them straight, I\ndid: well-to-do folk who come to see their dead four times a year, and\nbring their flowers themselves, and what flowers! and look twice at the\nkeep of them they pretend to cry over, and write on their tombstones all\nabout the tears they haven't shed, and come and make difficulties about\ntheir neighbours. You may believe me or not, sir, I never knew the young\nlady; I don't know what she did. Well, I'm quite in love with the poor\nthing; I look after her well, and I let her have her camellias at an\nhonest price. She is the dead body that I like the best. You see, sir,\nwe are obliged to love the dead, for we are kept so busy, we have hardly\ntime to love anything else.\"\n\nI looked at the man, and some of my readers will understand, without my\nneeding to explain it to them, the emotion which I felt on hearing him.\nHe observed it, no doubt, for he went on:\n\n\"They tell me there were people who ruined themselves over that girl,\nand lovers that worshipped her; well, when I think there isn't one of\nthem that so much as buys her a flower now, that's queer, sir, and\nsad. And, after all, she isn't so badly off, for she has her grave to\nherself, and if there is only one who remembers her, he makes up for the\nothers. But we have other poor girls here, just like her and just her\nage, and they are just thrown into a pauper's grave, and it breaks my\nheart when I hear their poor bodies drop into the earth. And not a soul\nthinks about them any more, once they are dead! 'Tisn't a merry trade,\nours, especially when we have a little heart left. What do you expect? I\ncan't help it. I have a fine, strapping girl myself; she's just twenty,\nand when a girl of that age comes here I think of her, and I don't care\nif it's a great lady or a vagabond, I can't help feeling it a bit. But\nI am taking up your time, sir, with my tales, and it wasn't to hear them\nyou came here. I was told to show you Mlle. Gautier's grave; here you\nhave it. Is there anything else I can do for you?\"\n\n\"Do you know M. Armand Duval's address?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes; he lives at Rue de ----; at least, that's where I always go to get\nmy money for the flowers you see there.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my good man.\"\n\nI gave one more look at the grave covered with flowers, half longing to\npenetrate the depths of the earth and see what the earth had made of the\nfair creature that had been cast to it; then I walked sadly away.\n\n\"Do you want to see M. Duval, sir?\" said the gardener, who was walking\nbeside me.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I am pretty sure he is not back yet, or he would have been here\nalready.\"\n\n\"You don't think he has forgotten Marguerite?\"\n\n\"I am not only sure he hasn't, but I would wager that he wants to change\nher grave simply in order to have one more look at her.\"\n\n\"Why do you think that?\"\n\n\"The first word he said to me when he came to the cemetery was: 'How can\nI see her again?' That can't be done unless there is a change of grave,\nand I told him all about the formalities that have to be attended to in\ngetting it done; for, you see, if you want to move a body from one grave\nto another you must have it identified, and only the family can give\nleave for it under the direction of a police inspector. That is why M.\nDuval has gone to see Mlle. Gautier's sister, and you may be sure his\nfirst visit will be for me.\"\n\nWe had come to the cemetery gate. I thanked the gardener again, putting\na few coins into his hand, and made my way to the address he had given\nme.\n\nArmand had not yet returned. I left word for him, begging him to come\nand see me as soon as he arrived, or to send me word where I could find\nhim.\n\nNext day, in the morning, I received a letter from Duval, telling me\nof his return, and asking me to call on him, as he was so worn out with\nfatigue that it was impossible for him to go out.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nI found Armand in bed. On seeing me he held out a burning hand. \"You\nare feverish,\" I said to him. \"It is nothing, the fatigue of a rapid\njourney; that is all.\" \"You have been to see Marguerite's sister?\" \"Yes;\nwho told you?\" \"I knew it. Did you get what you wanted?\"\n\n\"Yes; but who told you of my journey, and of my reason for taking it?\"\n\n\"The gardener of the cemetery.\"\n\n\"You have seen the tomb?\"\n\nI scarcely dared reply, for the tone in which the words were spoken\nproved to me that the speaker was still possessed by the emotion which\nI had witnessed before, and that every time his thoughts or speech\ntravelled back to that mournful subject emotion would still, for a long\ntime to come, prove stronger than his will. I contented myself with a\nnod of the head.\n\n\"He has looked after it well?\" continued Armand. Two big tears rolled\ndown the cheeks of the sick man, and he turned away his head to hide\nthem from me. I pretended not to see them, and tried to change the\nconversation. \"You have been away three weeks,\" I said.\n\nArmand passed his hand across his eyes and replied, \"Exactly three\nweeks.\"\n\n\"You had a long journey.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was not travelling all the time. I was ill for a fortnight or I\nshould have returned long ago; but I had scarcely got there when I took\nthis fever, and I was obliged to keep my room.\"\n\n\"And you started to come back before you were really well?\"\n\n\"If I had remained in the place for another week, I should have died\nthere.\"\n\n\"Well, now you are back again, you must take care of yourself; your\nfriends will come and look after you; myself, first of all, if you will\nallow me.\"\n\n\"I shall get up in a couple of hours.\"\n\n\"It would be very unwise.\"\n\n\"I must.\"\n\n\"What have you to do in such a great hurry?\"\n\n\"I must go to the inspector of police.\"\n\n\"Why do you not get one of your friends to see after the matter? It is\nlikely to make you worse than you are now.\"\n\n\"It is my only chance of getting better. I must see her. Ever since I\nheard of her death, especially since I saw her grave, I have not been\nable to sleep. I can not realize that this woman, so young and so\nbeautiful when I left her, is really dead. I must convince myself of it.\nI must see what God has done with a being that I have loved so much,\nand perhaps the horror of the sight will cure me of my despair. Will you\naccompany me, if it won't be troubling you too much?\"\n\n\"What did her sister say about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing. She seemed greatly surprised that a stranger wanted to buy\na plot of ground and give Marguerite a new grave, and she immediately\nsigned the authorization that I asked her for.\"\n\n\"Believe me, it would be better to wait until you are quite well.\"\n\n\"Have no fear; I shall be quite composed. Besides, I should simply go\nout of my mind if I were not to carry out a resolution which I have set\nmyself to carry out. I swear to you that I shall never be myself again\nuntil I have seen Marguerite. It is perhaps the thirst of the fever,\na sleepless night's dream, a moment's delirium; but though I were to\nbecome a Trappist, like M. de Rance', after having seen, I will see.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I said to Armand, \"and I am at your service. Have you\nseen Julie Duprat?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw her the day I returned, for the first time.\"\n\n\"Did she give you the papers that Marguerite had left for you?\"\n\nArmand drew a roll of papers from under his pillow, and immediately put\nthem back.\n\n\"I know all that is in these papers by heart,\" he said. \"For three weeks\nI have read them ten times over every day. You shall read them, too, but\nlater on, when I am calmer, and can make you understand all the love and\ntenderness hidden away in this confession. For the moment I want you to\ndo me a service.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Your cab is below?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Well, will you take my passport and ask if there are any letters for me\nat the poste restante? My father and sister must have written to me at\nParis, and I went away in such haste that I did not go and see before\nleaving. When you come back we will go together to the inspector of\npolice, and arrange for to-morrow's ceremony.\"\n\nArmand handed me his passport, and I went to Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau.\nThere were two letters addressed to Duval. I took them and returned.\nWhen I re-entered the room Armand was dressed and ready to go out.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, taking the letters. \"Yes,\" he added, after glancing\nat the addresses, \"they are from my father and sister. They must have\nbeen quite at a loss to understand my silence.\"\n\nHe opened the letters, guessed at rather than read them, for each was of\nfour pages; and a moment after folded them up. \"Come,\" he said, \"I will\nanswer tomorrow.\"\n\nWe went to the police station, and Armand handed in the permission\nsigned by Marguerite's sister. He received in return a letter to the\nkeeper of the cemetery, and it was settled that the disinterment was to\ntake place next day, at ten o'clock, that I should call for him an hour\nbefore, and that we should go to the cemetery together.\n\nI confess that I was curious to be present, and I did not sleep all\nnight. Judging from the thoughts which filled my brain, it must have\nbeen a long night for Armand. When I entered his room at nine on the\nfollowing morning he was frightfully pale, but seemed calm. He smiled\nand held out his hand. His candles were burned out; and before leaving\nhe took a very heavy letter addressed to his father, and no doubt\ncontaining an account of that night's impressions.\n\nHalf an hour later we were at Montmartre. The police inspector was there\nalready. We walked slowly in the direction of Marguerite's grave. The\ninspector went in front; Armand and I followed a few steps behind.\n\nFrom time to time I felt my companion's arm tremble convulsively, as if\nhe shivered from head to feet. I looked at him. He understood the look,\nand smiled at me; we had not exchanged a word since leaving the house.\n\nJust before we reached the grave, Armand stopped to wipe his face, which\nwas covered with great drops of sweat. I took advantage of the pause\nto draw in a long breath, for I, too, felt as if I had a weight on my\nchest.\n\nWhat is the origin of that mournful pleasure which we find in sights of\nthis kind? When we reached the grave the gardener had removed all the\nflower-pots, the iron railing had been taken away, and two men were\nturning up the soil.\n\nArmand leaned against a tree and watched. All his life seemed to pass\nbefore his eyes. Suddenly one of the two pickaxes struck against a\nstone. At the sound Armand recoiled, as at an electric shock, and seized\nmy hand with such force as to give me pain.\n\nOne of the grave-diggers took a shovel and began emptying out the earth;\nthen, when only the stones covering the coffin were left, he threw them\nout one by one.\n\nI scrutinized Armand, for every moment I was afraid lest the emotions\nwhich he was visibly repressing should prove too much for him; but he\nstill watched, his eyes fixed and wide open, like the eyes of a madman,\nand a slight trembling of the cheeks and lips were the only signs of the\nviolent nervous crisis under which he was suffering.\n\nAs for me, all I can say is that I regretted having come.\n\nWhen the coffin was uncovered the inspector said to the grave-digger:\n\"Open it.\" They obeyed, as if it were the most natural thing in the\nworld.\n\nThe coffin was of oak, and they began to unscrew the lid. The humidity\nof the earth had rusted the screws, and it was not without some\ndifficulty that the coffin was opened. A painful odour arose in spite of\nthe aromatic plants with which it was covered.\n\n\"O my God, my God!\" murmured Armand, and turned paler than before.\n\nEven the grave-digger drew back.\n\nA great white shroud covered the corpse, closely outlining some of its\ncontours. This shroud was almost completely eaten away at one end, and\nleft one of the feet visible.\n\nI was nearly fainting, and at the moment of writing these lines I see\nthe whole scene over again in all its imposing reality.\n\n\"Quick,\" said the inspector. Thereupon one of the men put out his hand,\nbegan to unsew the shroud, and taking hold of it by one end suddenly\nlaid bare the face of Marguerite.\n\nIt was terrible to see, it is horrible to relate. The eyes were nothing\nbut two holes, the lips had disappeared, vanished, and the white teeth\nwere tightly set. The black hair, long and dry, was pressed tightly\nabout the forehead, and half veiled the green hollows of the cheeks; and\nyet I recognised in this face the joyous white and rose face that I had\nseen so often.\n\nArmand, unable to turn away his eyes, had put the handkerchief to his\nmouth and bit it.\n\nFor my part, it was as if a circle of iron tightened about my head, a\nveil covered my eyes, a rumbling filled my ears, and all I could do was\nto unstop a smelling bottle which I happened to have with me, and to\ndraw in long breaths of it.\n\nThrough this bewilderment I heard the inspector say to Duval, \"Do you\nidentify?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the young man in a dull voice.\n\n\"Then fasten it up and take it away,\" said the inspector.\n\nThe grave-diggers put back the shroud over the face of the corpse,\nfastened up the coffin, took hold of each end of it, and began to carry\nit toward the place where they had been told to take it.\n\nArmand did not move. His eyes were fixed upon the empty grave; he was as\nwhite as the corpse which we had just seen. He looked as if he had been\nturned to stone.\n\nI saw what was coming as soon as the pain caused by the spectacle should\nhave abated and thus ceased to sustain him. I went up to the inspector.\n\"Is this gentleman's presence still necessary?\" I said, pointing to\nArmand.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"and I should advise you to take him away. He looks\nill.\"\n\n\"Come,\" I said to Armand, taking him by the arm.\n\n\"What?\" he said, looking at me as if he did not recognise me.\n\n\"It is all over,\" I added. \"You must come, my friend; you are quite\nwhite; you are cold. These emotions will be too much for you.\"\n\n\"You are right. Let us go,\" he answered mechanically, but without moving\na step.\n\nI took him by the arm and led him along. He let himself be guided like a\nchild, only from time to time murmuring, \"Did you see her eyes?\" and he\nturned as if the vision had recalled her.\n\nNevertheless, his steps became more irregular; he seemed to walk by a\nseries of jerks; his teeth chattered; his hands were cold; a violent\nagitation ran through his body. I spoke to him; he did not answer. He\nwas just able to let himself be led along. A cab was waiting at the\ngate. It was only just in time. Scarcely had he seated himself, when the\nshivering became more violent, and he had an actual attack of nerves, in\nthe midst of which his fear of frightening me made him press my hand and\nwhisper: \"It is nothing, nothing. I want to weep.\"\n\nHis chest laboured, his eyes were injected with blood, but no tears\ncame. I made him smell the salts which I had with me, and when we\nreached his house only the shivering remained.\n\nWith the help of his servant I put him to bed, lit a big fire in\nhis room, and hurried off to my doctor, to whom I told all that had\nhappened. He hastened with me.\n\nArmand was flushed and delirious; he stammered out disconnected words,\nin which only the name of Marguerite could be distinctly heard.\n\n\"Well?\" I said to the doctor when he had examined the patient.\n\n\"Well, he has neither more nor less than brain fever, and very lucky it\nis for him, for I firmly believe (God forgive me!) that he would have\ngone out of his mind. Fortunately, the physical malady will kill the\nmental one, and in a month's time he will be free from the one and\nperhaps from the other.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nIllnesses like Armand's have one fortunate thing about them: they either\nkill outright or are very soon overcome. A fortnight after the events\nwhich I have just related Armand was convalescent, and we had already\nbecome great friends. During the whole course of his illness I had\nhardly left his side.\n\nSpring was profuse in its flowers, its leaves, its birds, its songs; and\nmy friend's window opened gaily upon his garden, from which a reviving\nbreath of health seemed to come to him. The doctor had allowed him to\nget up, and we often sat talking at the open window, at the hour when\nthe sun is at its height, from twelve to two. I was careful not to refer\nto Marguerite, fearing lest the name should awaken sad recollections\nhidden under the apparent calm of the invalid; but Armand, on the\ncontrary, seemed to delight in speaking of her, not as formerly, with\ntears in his eyes, but with a sweet smile which reassured me as to the\nstate of his mind.\n\nI had noticed that ever since his last visit to the cemetery, and the\nsight which had brought on so violent a crisis, sorrow seemed to have\nbeen overcome by sickness, and Marguerite's death no longer appeared to\nhim under its former aspect. A kind of consolation had sprung from the\ncertainty of which he was now fully persuaded, and in order to banish\nthe sombre picture which often presented itself to him, he returned\nupon the happy recollections of his liaison with Marguerite, and seemed\nresolved to think of nothing else.\n\nThe body was too much weakened by the attack of fever, and even by\nthe process of its cure, to permit him any violent emotions, and the\nuniversal joy of spring which wrapped him round carried his thoughts\ninstinctively to images of joy. He had always obstinately refused to\ntell his family of the danger which he had been in, and when he was well\nagain his father did not even know that he had been ill.\n\nOne evening we had sat at the window later than usual; the weather had\nbeen superb, and the sun sank to sleep in a twilight dazzling with gold\nand azure. Though we were in Paris, the verdure which surrounded us\nseemed to shut us off from the world, and our conversation was only now\nand again disturbed by the sound of a passing vehicle.\n\n\"It was about this time of the year, on the evening of a day like this,\nthat I first met Marguerite,\" said Armand to me, as if he were listening\nto his own thoughts rather than to what I was saying. I did not answer.\nThen turning toward me, he said:\n\n\"I must tell you the whole story; you will make a book out of it; no one\nwill believe it, but it will perhaps be interesting to do.\"\n\n\"You will tell me all about it later on, my friend,\" I said to him; \"you\nare not strong enough yet.\"\n\n\"It is a warm evening, I have eaten my ration of chicken,\" he said to\nme, smiling; \"I have no fever, we have nothing to do, I will tell it to\nyou now.\"\n\n\"Since you really wish it, I will listen.\"\n\nThis is what he told me, and I have scarcely changed a word of the\ntouching story.\n\nYes (Armand went on, letting his head sink back on the chair), yes, it\nwas just such an evening as this. I had spent the day in the country\nwith one of my friends, Gaston R--. We returned to Paris in the evening,\nand not knowing what to do we went to the Varietes. We went out during\none of the entr'actes, and a tall woman passed us in the corridor, to\nwhom my friend bowed.\n\n\"Whom are you bowing to?\" I asked.\n\n\"Marguerite Gautier,\" he said.\n\n\"She seems much changed, for I did not recognise her,\" I said, with an\nemotion that you will soon understand.\n\n\"She has been ill; the poor girl won't last long.\"\n\nI remember the words as if they had been spoken to me yesterday.\n\nI must tell you, my friend, that for two years the sight of this girl\nhad made a strange impression on me whenever I came across her. Without\nknowing why, I turned pale and my heart beat violently. I have a friend\nwho studies the occult sciences, and he would call what I experienced\n\"the affinity of fluids\"; as for me, I only know that I was fated to\nfall in love with Marguerite, and that I foresaw it.\n\nIt is certainly the fact that she made a very definite impression upon\nme, that many of my friends had noticed it and that they had been much\namused when they saw who it was that made this impression upon me.\n\nThe first time I ever saw her was in the Place de la Bourse, outside\nSusse's; an open carriage was stationed there, and a woman dressed\nin white got down from it. A murmur of admiration greeted her as she\nentered the shop. As for me, I was rivetted to the spot from the moment\nshe went in till the moment when she came out again. I could see her\nthrough the shop windows selecting what she had come to buy. I might\nhave gone in, but I dared not. I did not know who she was, and I\nwas afraid lest she should guess why I had come in and be offended.\nNevertheless, I did not think I should ever see her again.\n\nShe was elegantly dressed; she wore a muslin dress with many flounces,\nan Indian shawl embroidered at the corners with gold and silk flowers,\na straw hat, a single bracelet, and a heavy gold chain, such as was just\nthen beginning to be the fashion.\n\nShe returned to her carriage and drove away. One of the shopmen stood at\nthe door looking after his elegant customer's carriage. I went up to him\nand asked him what was the lady's name.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Marguerite Gautier,\" he replied. I dared not ask him for\nher address, and went on my way.\n\nThe recollection of this vision, for it was really a vision, would not\nleave my mind like so many visions I had seen, and I looked everywhere\nfor this royally beautiful woman in white.\n\nA few days later there was a great performance at the Opera Comique. The\nfirst person I saw in one of the boxes was Marguerite Gautier.\n\nThe young man whom I was with recognised her immediately, for he said to\nme, mentioning her name: \"Look at that pretty girl.\"\n\nAt that moment Marguerite turned her opera-glass in our direction and,\nseeing my friend, smiled and beckoned to him to come to her.\n\n\"I will go and say 'How do you do?' to her,\" he said, \"and will be back\nin a moment.\"\n\n\"I could not help saying 'Happy man!'\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To go and see that woman.\"\n\n\"Are you in love with her?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, flushing, for I really did not know what to say; \"but I\nshould very much like to know her.\"\n\n\"Come with me. I will introduce you.\"\n\n\"Ask her if you may.\"\n\n\"Really, there is no need to be particular with her; come.\"\n\nWhat he said troubled me. I feared to discover that Marguerite was not\nworthy of the sentiment which I felt for her.\n\nIn a book of Alphonse Karr entitles Am Rauchen, there is a man who one\nevening follows a very elegant woman, with whom he had fallen in love\nwith at first sight on account of her beauty. Only to kiss her hand he\nfelt that he had the strength to undertake anything, the will to conquer\nanything, the courage to achieve anything. He scarcely dares glance at\nthe trim ankle which she shows as she holds her dress out of the mud.\nWhile he is dreaming of all that he would do to possess this woman, she\nstops at the corner of the street and asks if he will come home with\nher. He turns his head, crosses the street, and goes sadly back to his\nown house.\n\nI recalled the story, and, having longed to suffer for this woman, I was\nafraid that she would accept me too promptly and give me at once what\nI fain would have purchased by long waiting or some great sacrifice. We\nmen are built like that, and it is very fortunate that the imagination\nlends so much poetry to the senses, and that the desires of the body\nmake thus such concession to the dreams of the soul. If anyone had\nsaid to me, You shall have this woman to-night and be killed tomorrow, I\nwould have accepted. If anyone had said to me, you can be her lover for\nten pounds, I would have refused. I would have cried like a child who\nsees the castle he has been dreaming about vanish away as he awakens\nfrom sleep.\n\nAll the same, I wished to know her; it was my only means of making up my\nmind about her. I therefore said to my friend that I insisted on having\nher permission to be introduced to her, and I wandered to and fro in the\ncorridors, saying to myself that in a moment's time she was going to\nsee me, and that I should not know which way to look. I tried (sublime\nchildishness of love!) to string together the words I should say to her.\n\nA moment after my friend returned. \"She is expecting us,\" he said.\n\n\"Is she alone?\" I asked.\n\n\"With another woman.\"\n\n\"There are no men?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Come, then.\"\n\nMy friend went toward the door of the theatre.\n\n\"That is not the way,\" I said.\n\n\"We must go and get some sweets. She asked me for some.\"\n\nWe went into a confectioner's in the passage de l'Opera. I would have\nbought the whole shop, and I was looking about to see what sweets to\nchoose, when my friend asked for a pound of raisins glaces.\n\n\"Do you know if she likes them?\"\n\n\"She eats no other kind of sweets; everybody knows it.\n\n\"Ah,\" he went on when we had left the shop, \"do you know what kind of\nwoman it is that I am going to introduce you to? Don't imagine it is\na duchess. It is simply a kept woman, very much kept, my dear fellow;\ndon't be shy, say anything that comes into your head.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I stammered, and I followed him, saying to myself that I\nshould soon cure myself of my passion.\n\nWhen I entered the box Marguerite was in fits of laughter. I would\nrather that she had been sad. My friend introduced me; Marguerite gave\nme a little nod, and said, \"And my sweets?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\nShe looked at me as she took them. I dropped my eyes and blushed.\n\nShe leaned across to her neighbour and said something in her ear, at\nwhich both laughed. Evidently I was the cause of their mirth, and\nmy embarrassment increased. At that time I had as mistress a very\naffectionate and sentimental little person, whose sentiment and whose\nmelancholy letters amused me greatly. I realized the pain I must have\ngiven her by what I now experienced, and for five minutes I loved her as\nno woman was ever loved.\n\nMarguerite ate her raisins glaces without taking any more notice of me.\nThe friend who had introduced me did not wish to let me remain in so\nridiculous a position.\n\n\"Marguerite,\" he said, \"you must not be surprised if M. Duval says\nnothing: you overwhelm him to such a degree that he can not find a word\nto say.\"\n\n\"I should say, on the contrary, that he has only come with you because\nit would have bored you to come here by yourself.\"\n\n\"If that were true,\" I said, \"I should not have begged Ernest to ask\nyour permission to introduce me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that was only in order to put off the fatal moment.\"\n\nHowever little one may have known women like Marguerite, one can not but\nknow the delight they take in pretending to be witty and in teasing the\npeople whom they meet for the first time. It is no doubt a return for\nthe humiliations which they often have to submit to on the part of those\nwhom they see every day.\n\nTo answer them properly, one requires a certain knack, and I had not had\nthe opportunity of acquiring it; besides, the idea that I had formed\nof Marguerite accentuated the effects of her mockery. Nothing that dame\nfrom her was indifferent to me. I rose to my feet, saying in an altered\nvoice, which I could not entirely control:\n\n\"If that is what you think of me, madame, I have only to ask your pardon\nfor my indiscretion, and to take leave of you with the assurance that it\nshall not occur again.\"\n\nThereupon I bowed and quitted the box. I had scarcely closed the door\nwhen I heard a third peal of laughter. It would not have been well for\nanybody who had elbowed me at that moment.\n\nI returned to my seat. The signal for raising the curtain was given.\nErnest came back to his place beside me.\n\n\"What a way you behaved!\" he said, as he sat down. \"They will think you\nare mad.\"\n\n\"What did Marguerite say after I had gone?\"\n\n\"She laughed, and said she had never seen anyone so funny. But don't\nlook upon it as a lost chance; only do not do these women the honour\nof taking them seriously. They do not know what politeness and ceremony\nare. It is as if you were to offer perfumes to dogs--they would think it\nsmelled bad, and go and roll in the gutter.\"\n\n\"After all, what does it matter to me?\" I said, affecting to speak in a\nnonchalant way. \"I shall never see this woman again, and if I liked her\nbefore meeting her, it is quite different now that I know her.\"\n\n\"Bah! I don't despair of seeing you one day at the back of her box,\nand of bearing that you are ruining yourself for her. However, you are\nright, she hasn't been well brought up; but she would be a charming\nmistress to have.\"\n\nHappily, the curtain rose and my friend was silent. I could not possibly\ntell you what they were acting. All that I remember is that from time to\ntime I raised my eyes to the box I had quitted so abruptly, and that the\nfaces of fresh visitors succeeded one another all the time.\n\nI was far from having given up thinking about Marguerite. Another\nfeeling had taken possession of me. It seemed to me that I had her\ninsult and my absurdity to wipe out; I said to myself that if I spent\nevery penny I had, I would win her and win my right to the place I had\nabandoned so quickly.\n\nBefore the performance was over Marguerite and her friend left the box.\nI rose from my seat.\n\n\"Are you going?\" said Ernest.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nAt that moment he saw that the box was empty.\n\n\"Go, go,\" he said, \"and good luck, or rather better luck.\"\n\nI went out.\n\nI heard the rustle of dresses, the sound of voices, on the staircase.\nI stood aside, and, without being seen, saw the two women pass me,\naccompanied by two young men. At the entrance to the theatre they were\nmet by a footman.\n\n\"Tell the coachman to wait at the door of the Cafe' Anglais,\" said\nMarguerite. \"We will walk there.\"\n\nA few minutes afterward I saw Marguerite from the street at a window of\none of the large rooms of the restaurant, pulling the camellias of her\nbouquet to pieces, one by one. One of the two men was leaning over\nher shoulder and whispering in her ear. I took up my position at the\nMaison-d'or, in one of the first-floor rooms, and did not lose sight of\nthe window for an instant. At one in the morning Marguerite got into\nher carriage with her three friends. I took a cab and followed them. The\ncarriage stopped at No. 9, Rue d'Antin. Marguerite got out and went\nin alone. It was no doubt a mere chance, but the chance filled me with\ndelight.\n\nFrom that time forward, I often met Marguerite at the theatre or in\nthe Champs-Elysees. Always there was the same gaiety in her, the same\nemotion in me.\n\nAt last a fortnight passed without my meeting her. I met Gaston and\nasked after her.\n\n\"Poor girl, she is very ill,\" he answered.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"She is consumptive, and the sort of life she leads isn't exactly the\nthing to cure her. She has taken to her bed; she is dying.\"\n\nThe heart is a strange thing; I was almost glad at hearing it.\n\nEvery day I went to ask after her, without leaving my name or my card. I\nheard she was convalescent and had gone to Bagneres.\n\nTime went by, the impression, if not the memory, faded gradually from my\nmind. I travelled; love affairs, habits, work, took the place of other\nthoughts, and when I recalled this adventure I looked upon it as one of\nthose passions which one has when one is very young, and laughs at soon\nafterward.\n\nFor the rest, it was no credit to me to have got the better of this\nrecollection, for I had completely lost sight of Marguerite, and, as I\ntold you, when she passed me in the corridor of the Varietes, I did not\nrecognise her. She was veiled, it is true; but, veiled though she might\nhave been two years earlier, I should not have needed to see her in\norder to recognise her: I should have known her intuitively. All the\nsame, my heart began to beat when I knew that it was she; and the two\nyears that had passed since I saw her, and what had seemed to be the\nresults of that separation, vanished in smoke at the mere touch of her\ndress.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nHowever (continued Armand after a pause), while I knew myself to be\nstill in love with her, I felt more sure of myself, and part of my\ndesire to speak to Marguerite again was a wish to make her see that I\nwas stronger than she.\n\nHow many ways does the heart take, how many reasons does it invent for\nitself, in order to arrive at what it wants!\n\nI could not remain in the corridor, and I returned to my place in the\nstalls, looking hastily around to see what box she was in. She was in a\nground-floor box, quite alone. She had changed, as I have told you, and\nno longer wore an indifferent smile on her lips. She had suffered; she\nwas still suffering. Though it was April, she was still wearing a winter\ncostume, all wrapped up in furs.\n\nI gazed at her so fixedly that my eyes attracted hers. She looked at me\nfor a few seconds, put up her opera-glass to see me better, and seemed\nto think she recognised me, without being quite sure who I was, for when\nshe put down her glasses, a smile, that charming, feminine salutation,\nflitted across her lips, as if to answer the bow which she seemed to\nexpect; but I did not respond, so as to have an advantage over her, as\nif I had forgotten, while she remembered. Supposing herself mistaken,\nshe looked away.\n\nThe curtain went up. I have often seen Marguerite at the theatre. I\nnever saw her pay the slightest attention to what was being acted. As\nfor me, the performance interested me equally little, and I paid no\nattention to anything but her, though doing my utmost to keep her from\nnoticing it.\n\nPresently I saw her glancing across at the person who was in the\nopposite box; on looking, I saw a woman with whom I was quite familiar.\nShe had once been a kept woman, and had tried to go on the stage, had\nfailed, and, relying on her acquaintance with fashionable people in\nParis, had gone into business and taken a milliner's shop. I saw in her\na means of meeting with Marguerite, and profited by a moment in which\nshe looked my way to wave my hand to her. As I expected, she beckoned to\nme to come to her box.\n\nPrudence Duvernoy (that was the milliner's auspicious name) was one of\nthose fat women of forty with whom one requires very little diplomacy\nto make them understand what one wants to know, especially when what one\nwants to know is as simple as what I had to ask of her.\n\nI took advantage of a moment when she was smiling across at Marguerite\nto ask her, \"Whom are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Marguerite Gautier.\"\n\n\"You know her?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am her milliner, and she is a neighbour of mine.\"\n\n\"Do you live in the Rue d'Antin?\"\n\n\"No. 7. The window of her dressing-room looks on to the window of mine.\"\n\n\"They say she is a charming girl.\"\n\n\"Don't you know her?\"\n\n\"No, but I should like to.\"\n\n\"Shall I ask her to come over to our box?\"\n\n\"No, I would rather for you to introduce me to her.\"\n\n\"At her own house?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"That is more difficult.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because she is under the protection of a jealous old duke.\"\n\n\"'Protection' is charming.\"\n\n\"Yes, protection,\" replied Prudence. \"Poor old man, he would be greatly\nembarrassed to offer her anything else.\"\n\nPrudence then told me how Marguerite had made the acquaintance of the\nduke at Bagneres.\n\n\"That, then,\" I continued, \"is why she is alone here?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But who will see her home?\"\n\n\"He will.\"\n\n\"He will come for her?\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\n\"And you, who is seeing you home?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"May I offer myself?\"\n\n\"But you are with a friend, are you not?\"\n\n\"May we offer, then?\"\n\n\"Who is your friend?\"\n\n\"A charming fellow, very amusing. He will be delighted to make your\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"Well, all right; we will go after this piece is over, for I know the\nlast piece.\"\n\n\"With pleasure; I will go and tell my friend.\"\n\n\"Go, then. Ah,\" added Prudence, as I was going, \"there is the duke just\ncoming into Marguerite's box.\"\n\nI looked at him. A man of about seventy had sat down behind her, and was\ngiving her a bag of sweets, into which she dipped at once, smiling. Then\nshe held it out toward Prudence, with a gesture which seemed to say,\n\"Will you have some?\"\n\n\"No,\" signalled Prudence.\n\nMarguerite drew back the bag, and, turning, began to talk with the duke.\n\nIt may sound childish to tell you all these details, but everything\nrelating to Marguerite is so fresh in my memory that I can not help\nrecalling them now.\n\nI went back to Gaston and told him of the arrangement I had made for\nhim and for me. He agreed, and we left our stalls to go round to Mme.\nDuvernoy's box. We had scarcely opened the door leading into the stalls\nwhen we had to stand aside to allow Marguerite and the duke to pass.\nI would have given ten years of my life to have been in the old man's\nplace.\n\nWhen they were on the street he handed her into a phaeton, which he\ndrove himself, and they were whirled away by two superb horses.\n\nWe returned to Prudence's box, and when the play was over we took a cab\nand drove to 7, Rue d'Antin. At the door, Prudence asked us to come up\nand see her showrooms, which we had never seen, and of which she seemed\nvery proud. You can imagine how eagerly I accepted. It seemed to me\nas if I was coming nearer and nearer to Marguerite. I soon turned the\nconversation in her direction.\n\n\"The old duke is at your neighbours,\" I said to Prudence.\n\n\"Oh, no; she is probably alone.\"\n\n\"But she must be dreadfully bored,\" said Gaston.\n\n\"We spend most of our evening together, or she calls to me when she\ncomes in. She never goes to bed before two in the morning. She can't\nsleep before that.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because she suffers in the chest, and is almost always feverish.\"\n\n\"Hasn't she any lovers?\" I asked.\n\n\"I never see anyone remain after I leave; I don't say no one ever comes\nwhen I am gone. Often in the evening I meet there a certain Comte de N.,\nwho thinks he is making some headway by calling on her at eleven in the\nevening, and by sending her jewels to any extent; but she can't stand\nhim. She makes a mistake; he is very rich. It is in vain that I say to\nher from time to time, 'My dear child, there's the man for you.' She,\nwho generally listens to me, turns her back and replies that he is too\nstupid. Stupid, indeed, he is; but it would be a position for her, while\nthis old duke might die any day. Old men are egoists; his family are\nalways reproaching him for his affection for Marguerite; there are two\nreasons why he is likely to leave her nothing. I give her good advice,\nand she only says it will be plenty of time to take on the count when\nthe duke is dead. It isn't all fun,\" continued Prudence, \"to live like\nthat. I know very well it wouldn't suit me, and I should soon send the\nold man about his business. He is so dull; he calls her his daughter;\nlooks after her like a child; and is always in the way. I am sure at\nthis very moment one of his servants is prowling about in the street to\nsee who comes out, and especially who goes in.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor Marguerite!\" said Gaston, sitting down to the piano and\nplaying a waltz. \"I hadn't a notion of it, but I did notice she hasn't\nbeen looking so gay lately.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said Prudence, listening. Gaston stopped.\n\n\"She is calling me, I think.\"\n\nWe listened. A voice was calling, \"Prudence!\"\n\n\"Come, now, you must go,\" said Mme. Duvernoy.\n\n\"Ah, that is your idea of hospitality,\" said Gaston, laughing; \"we won't\ngo till we please.\"\n\n\"Why should we go?\"\n\n\"I am going over to Marguerite's.\"\n\n\"We will wait here.\"\n\n\"You can't.\"\n\n\"Then we will go with you.\"\n\n\"That still less.\"\n\n\"I know Marguerite,\" said Gaston; \"I can very well pay her a call.\"\n\n\"But Armand doesn't know her.\"\n\n\"I will introduce him.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nWe again heard Marguerite's voice calling to Prudence, who rushed to her\ndressing-room window. I followed with Gaston as she opened the window.\nWe hid ourselves so as not to be seen from outside.\n\n\"I have been calling you for ten minutes,\" said Marguerite from her\nwindow, in almost an imperious tone of voice.\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want you to come over at once.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the Comte de N. is still here, and he is boring me to death.\"\n\n\"I can't now.\"\n\n\"What is hindering you?\"\n\n\"There are two young fellows here who won't go.\"\n\n\"Tell them that you must go out.\"\n\n\"I have told them.\"\n\n\"Well, then, leave them in the house. They will soon go when they see\nyou have gone.\"\n\n\"They will turn everything upside down.\"\n\n\"But what do they want?\"\n\n\"They want to see you.\"\n\n\"What are they called?\"\n\n\"You know one, M. Gaston R.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I know him. And the other?\"\n\n\"M. Armand Duval; and you don't know him.\"\n\n\"No, but bring them along. Anything is better than the count. I expect\nyou. Come at once.\"\n\nMarguerite closed her window and Prudence hers. Marguerite, who had\nremembered my face for a moment, did not remember my name. I would\nrather have been remembered to my disadvantage than thus forgotten.\n\n\"I knew,\" said Gaston, \"that she would be delighted to see us.\"\n\n\"Delighted isn't the word,\" replied Prudence, as she put on her hat and\nshawl. \"She will see you in order to get rid of the count. Try to be\nmore agreeable than he is, or (I know Marguerite) she will put it all\ndown to me.\"\n\nWe followed Prudence downstairs. I trembled; it seemed to me that\nthis visit was to have a great influence on my life. I was still more\nagitated than on the evening when I was introduced in the box at the\nOpera Comique. As we reached the door that you know, my heart beat so\nviolently that I was hardly able to think.\n\nWe heard the sound of a piano. Prudence rang. The piano was silent. A\nwoman who looked more like a companion than a servant opened the door.\nWe went into the drawing-room, and from that to the boudoir, which was\nthen just as you have seen it since. A young man was leaning against the\nmantel-piece. Marguerite, seated at the piano, let her fingers wander\nover the notes, beginning scraps of music without finishing them. The\nwhole scene breathed boredom, the man embarrassed by the consciousness\nof his nullity, the woman tired of her dismal visitor. At the voice of\nPrudence, Marguerite rose, and coming toward us with a look of gratitude\nto Mme. Duvernoy, said:\n\n\"Come in, and welcome.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\"Good-evening, my dear Gaston,\" said Marguerite to my companion. \"I am\nvery glad to see you. Why didn't you come to see me in my box at the\nVarietes?\"\n\n\"I was afraid it would be indiscreet.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" and Marguerite lingered over the word, as if to intimate to\nthose who were present that in spite of the familiar way in which she\ngreeted him, Gaston was not and never had been anything more than a\nfriend, \"friends are always welcome.\"\n\n\"Then, will you permit me to introduce M. Armand Duval?\"\n\n\"I had already authorized Prudence to do so.\"\n\n\"As far as that goes, madame,\" I said, bowing, and succeeding in getting\nmore or less intelligible sounds out of my throat, \"I have already had\nthe honour of being introduced to you.\"\n\nMarguerite's beautiful eyes seemed to be looking back in memory, but she\ncould not, or seemed not to, remember.\n\n\"Madame,\" I continued, \"I am grateful to you for having forgotten the\noccasion of my first introduction, for I was very absurd and must have\nseemed to you very tiresome. It was at the Opera Comique, two years ago;\nI was with Ernest de ----.\"\n\n\"Ah, I remember,\" said Marguerite, with a smile. \"It was not you who\nwere absurd; it was I who was mischievous, as I still am, but somewhat\nless. You have forgiven me?\"\n\nAnd she held out her hand, which I kissed.\n\n\"It is true,\" she went on; \"you know I have the bad habit of trying\nto embarrass people the first time I meet them. It is very stupid.\nMy doctor says it is because I am nervous and always ill; believe my\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"But you seem quite well.\"\n\n\"Oh! I have been very ill.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Every one knew it; I often came to inquire after you, and I was happy\nto hear of your convalescence.\"\n\n\"They never gave me your card.\"\n\n\"I did not leave it.\"\n\n\"Was it you, then, who called every day while I was ill, and would never\nleave your name?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was I.\"\n\n\"Then you are more than indulgent, you are generous. You, count,\nwouldn't have done that,\" said she, turning toward M. de N., after\ngiving me one of those looks in which women sum up their opinion of a\nman.\n\n\"I have only known you for two months,\" replied the count.\n\n\"And this gentleman only for five minutes. You always say something\nridiculous.\"\n\nWomen are pitiless toward those whom they do not care for. The count\nreddened and bit his lips.\n\nI was sorry for him, for he seemed, like myself, to be in love, and\nthe bitter frankness of Marguerite must have made him very unhappy,\nespecially in the presence of two strangers.\n\n\"You were playing the piano when we came in,\" I said, in order to\nchange the conversation. \"Won't you be so good as to treat me as an old\nacquaintance and go on?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said she, flinging herself on the sofa and motioning to us to sit\ndown, \"Gaston knows what my music is like. It is all very well when I am\nalone with the count, but I won't inflict such a punishment on you.\"\n\n\"You show me that preference?\" said M. de N., with a smile which he\ntried to render delicately ironical.\n\n\"Don't reproach me for it. It is the only one.\" It was fated that the\npoor man was not to say a single word. He cast a really supplicating\nglance at Marguerite.\n\n\"Well, Prudence,\" she went on, \"have you done what I asked you to do?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"All right. You will tell me about it later. We must talk over it; don't\ngo before I can speak with you.\"\n\n\"We are doubtless intruders,\" I said, \"and now that we, or rather I,\nhave had a second introduction, to blot out the first, it is time for\nGaston and me to be going.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. I didn't mean that for you. I want you to stay.\"\n\nThe count took a very elegant watch out of his pocket and looked at the\ntime. \"I must be going to my club,\" he said. Marguerite did not answer.\nThe count thereupon left his position by the fireplace and going up to\nher, said: \"Adieu, madame.\"\n\nMarguerite rose. \"Adieu, my dear count. Are you going already?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fear I am boring you.\"\n\n\"You are not boring me to-day more than any other day. When shall I be\nseeing you?\"\n\n\"When you permit me.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then.\"\n\nIt was cruel, you will admit. Fortunately, the count had excellent\nmanners and was very good-tempered. He merely kissed Marguerite's hand,\nwhich she held out to him carelessly enough, and, bowing to us, went\nout.\n\nAs he crossed the threshold, he cast a glance at Prudence. She shrugged\nher shoulders, as much as to say:\n\n\"What do you expect? I have done all I could.\"\n\n\"Nanine!\" cried Marguerite. \"Light M. le Comte to the door.\"\n\nWe heard the door open and shut.\n\n\"At last,\" cried Marguerite, coming back, \"he has gone! That man gets\nfrightfully on my nerves!\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Prudence, \"you really treat him too badly, and he\nis so good and kind to you. Look at this watch on the mantel-piece, that\nhe gave you: it must have cost him at least three thousand francs, I am\nsure.\"\n\nAnd Mme. Duvernoy began to turn it over, as it lay on the mantel-piece,\nlooking at it with covetous eyes.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Marguerite, sitting down to the piano, \"when I put on\none side what he gives me and on the other what he says to me, it seems\nto me that he buys his visits very cheap.\"\n\n\"The poor fellow is in love with you.\"\n\n\"If I had to listen to everybody who was in love with me, I shouldn't\nhave time for my dinner.\"\n\nAnd she began to run her fingers over the piano, and then, turning to\nus, she said:\n\n\"What will you take? I think I should like a little punch.\"\n\n\"And I could eat a little chicken,\" said Prudence. \"Suppose we have\nsupper?\"\n\n\"That's it, let's go and have supper,\" said Gaston.\n\n\"No, we will have supper here.\"\n\nShe rang, and Nanine appeared.\n\n\"Send for some supper.\"\n\n\"What must I get?\"\n\n\"Whatever you like, but at once, at once.\"\n\nNanine went out.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Marguerite, jumping like a child, \"we'll have supper.\nHow tiresome that idiot of a count is!\"\n\nThe more I saw her, the more she enchanted me. She was exquisitely\nbeautiful. Her slenderness was a charm. I was lost in contemplation.\n\nWhat was passing in my mind I should have some difficulty in explaining.\nI was full of indulgence for her life, full of admiration for her\nbeauty. The proof of disinterestedness that she gave in not accepting a\nrich and fashionable young man, ready to waste all his money upon her,\nexcused her in my eyes for all her faults in the past.\n\nThere was a kind of candour in this woman. You could see she was still\nin the virginity of vice. Her firm walk, her supple figure, her rosy,\nopen nostrils, her large eyes, slightly tinged with blue, indicated\none of those ardent natures which shed around them a sort of voluptuous\nperfume, like Eastern vials, which, close them as tightly as you will,\nstill let some of their perfume escape. Finally, whether it was simple\nnature or a breath of fever, there passed from time to time in the eyes\nof this woman a glimmer of desire, giving promise of a very heaven for\none whom she should love. But those who had loved Marguerite were not to\nbe counted, nor those whom she had loved.\n\nIn this girl there was at once the virgin whom a mere nothing had turned\ninto a courtesan, and the courtesan whom a mere nothing would have\nturned into the most loving and the purest of virgins. Marguerite had\nstill pride and independence, two sentiments which, if they are wounded,\ncan be the equivalent of a sense of shame. I did not speak a word; my\nsoul seemed to have passed into my heart and my heart into my eyes.\n\n\"So,\" said she all at once, \"it was you who came to inquire after me\nwhen I was ill?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know, it was quite splendid of you! How can I thank you for it?\"\n\n\"By allowing me to come and see you from time to time.\"\n\n\"As often as you like, from five to six, and from eleven to twelve. Now,\nGaston, play the Invitation A la Valse.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"To please me, first of all, and then because I never can manage to play\nit myself.\"\n\n\"What part do you find difficult?\"\n\n\"The third part, the part in sharps.\"\n\nGaston rose and went to the piano, and began to play the wonderful\nmelody of Weber, the music of which stood open before him.\n\nMarguerite, resting one hand on the piano, followed every note on the\nmusic, accompanying it in a low voice, and when Gaston had come to\nthe passage which she had mentioned to him, she sang out, running her\nfingers along the top of the piano:\n\n\"Do, re, mi, do, re, fa, mi, re; that is what I can not do. Over again.\"\n\nGaston began over again, after which Marguerite said:\n\n\"Now, let me try.\"\n\nShe took her place and began to play; but her rebellious fingers always\ncame to grief over one of the notes.\n\n\"Isn't it incredible,\" she said, exactly like a child, \"that I can not\nsucceed in playing that passage? Would you believe that I sometimes\nspend two hours of the morning over it? And when I think that that idiot\nof a count plays it without his music, and beautifully, I really believe\nit is that that makes me so furious with him.\" And she began again,\nalways with the same result.\n\n\"The devil take Weber, music, and pianos!\" she cried, throwing the music\nto the other end of the room. \"How can I play eight sharps one after\nanother?\" She folded her arms and looked at us, stamping her foot. The\nblood flew to her cheeks, and her lips half opened in a slight cough.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Prudence, who had taken off her hat and was smoothing\nher hair before the glass, \"you will work yourself into a rage and do\nyourself harm. Better come and have supper; for my part, I am dying of\nhunger.\"\n\nMarguerite rang the bell, sat down to the piano again, and began to hum\nover a very risky song, which she accompanied without difficulty. Gaston\nknew the song, and they gave a sort of duet.\n\n\"Don't sing those beastly things,\" I said to Marguerite, imploringly.\n\n\"Oh, how proper you are!\" she said, smiling and giving me her hand. \"It\nis not for myself, but for you.\"\n\nMarguerite made a gesture as if to say, \"Oh, it is long since that I\nhave done with propriety!\" At that moment Nanine appeared.\n\n\"Is supper ready?\" asked Marguerite. \"Yes, madame, in one moment.\"\n\n\"Apropos,\" said Prudence to me, \"you have not looked round; come, and I\nwill show you.\" As you know, the drawing-room was a marvel.\n\nMarguerite went with us for a moment; then she called Gaston and went\ninto the dining-room with him to see if supper was ready.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Prudence, catching sight of a little Saxe figure on a\nside-table, \"I never knew you had this little gentleman.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"A little shepherd holding a bird-cage.\"\n\n\"Take it, if you like it.\"\n\n\n\"I won't deprive you of it.\"\n\n\"I was going to give it to my maid. I think it hideous; but if you like\nit, take it.\"\n\nPrudence only saw the present, not the way in which it was given. She\nput the little figure on one side, and took me into the dressing-room,\nwhere she showed me two miniatures hanging side by side, and said:\n\n\"That is the Comte de G., who was very much in love with Marguerite; it\nwas he who brought her out. Do you know him?\"\n\n\"No. And this one?\" I inquired, pointing to the other miniature.\n\n\"That is the little Vicomte de L. He was obliged to disappear.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because he was all but ruined. That's one, if you like, who loved\nMarguerite.\"\n\n\"And she loved him, too, no doubt?\"\n\n\"She is such a queer girl, one never knows. The night he went away\nshe went to the theatre as usual, and yet she had cried when he said\ngood-bye to her.\"\n\nJust then Nanine appeared, to tell us that supper was served.\n\nWhen we entered the dining-room, Marguerite was leaning against the\nwall, and Gaston, holding her hands, was speaking to her in a low voice.\n\n\"You are mad,\" replied Marguerite. \"You know quite well that I don't\nwant you. It is no good at the end of two years to make love to a woman\nlike me. With us, it is at once, or never. Come, gentlemen, supper!\"\n\nAnd, slipping away from Gaston, Marguerite made him sit on her right at\ntable, me on her left, then called to Nanine:\n\n\"Before you sit down, tell them in the kitchen not to open to anybody if\nthere is a ring.\"\n\nThis order was given at one o'clock in the morning.\n\nWe laughed, drank, and ate freely at this supper. In a short while mirth\nhad reached its last limit, and the words that seem funny to a certain\nclass of people, words that degrade the mouth that utters them, were\nheard from time to time, amidst the applause of Nanine, of Prudence, and\nof Marguerite. Gaston was thoroughly amused; he was a very good sort of\nfellow, but somewhat spoiled by the habits of his youth. For a moment\nI tried to forget myself, to force my heart and my thoughts to become\nindifferent to the sight before me, and to take my share of that gaiety\nwhich seemed like one of the courses of the meal. But little by little\nI withdrew from the noise; my glass remained full, and I felt almost\nsad as I saw this beautiful creature of twenty drinking, talking like a\nporter, and laughing the more loudly the more scandalous was the joke.\n\nNevertheless, this hilarity, this way of talking and drinking, which\nseemed to me in the others the mere results of bad company or of bad\nhabits, seemed in Marguerite a necessity of forgetting, a fever, a\nnervous irritability. At every glass of champagne her cheeks would flush\nwith a feverish colour, and a cough, hardly perceptible at the beginning\nof supper, became at last so violent that she was obliged to lean her\nhead on the back of her chair and hold her chest in her hands every time\nthat she coughed. I suffered at the thought of the injury to so frail a\nconstitution which must come from daily excesses like this. At length,\nsomething which I had feared and foreseen happened. Toward the end of\nsupper Marguerite was seized by a more violent fit of coughing than any\nshe had had while I was there. It seemed as if her chest were being torn\nin two. The poor girl turned crimson, closed her eyes under the pain,\nand put her napkin to her lips. It was stained with a drop of blood. She\nrose and ran into her dressing-room.\n\n\"What is the matter with Marguerite?\" asked Gaston.\n\n\"She has been laughing too much, and she is spitting blood. Oh, it is\nnothing; it happens to her every day. She will be back in a minute.\nLeave her alone. She prefers it.\"\n\nI could not stay still; and, to the consternation of Prudence and\nNanine, who called to me to come back, I followed Marguerite.\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe room to which she had fled was lit only by a single candle. She lay\nback on a great sofa, her dress undone, holding one hand on her heart,\nand letting the other hang by her side. On the table was a basin half\nfull of water, and the water was stained with streaks of blood.\n\nVery pale, her mouth half open, Marguerite tried to recover breath. Now\nand again her bosom was raised by a long sigh, which seemed to\nrelieve her a little, and for a few seconds she would seem to be quite\ncomfortable.\n\nI went up to her; she made no movement, and I sat down and took the hand\nwhich was lying on the sofa.\n\n\"Ah! it is you,\" she said, with a smile.\n\nI must have looked greatly agitated, for she added:\n\n\"Are you unwell, too?\"\n\n\"No, but you: do you still suffer?\"\n\n\"Very little;\" and she wiped off with her handkerchief the tears which\nthe coughing had brought to her eyes; \"I am used to it now.\"\n\n\"You are killing yourself, madame,\" I said to her in a moved voice. \"I\nwish I were a friend, a relation of yours, that I might keep you from\ndoing yourself harm like this.\"\n\n\"Ah! it is really not worth your while to alarm yourself,\" she replied\nin a somewhat bitter tone; \"see how much notice the others take of me!\nThey know too well that there is nothing to be done.\"\n\nThereupon she got up, and, taking the candle, put it on the mantel-piece\nand looked at herself in the glass.\n\n\"How pale I am!\" she said, as she fastened her dress and passed her\nfingers over her loosened hair. \"Come, let us go back to supper. Are you\ncoming?\"\n\nI sat still and did not move.\n\nShe saw how deeply I had been affected by the whole scene, and, coming\nup to me, held out her hand, saying:\n\n\"Come now, let us go.\"\n\nI took her hand, raised it to my lips, and in spite of myself two tears\nfell upon it.\n\n\"Why, what a child you are!\" she said, sitting down by my side again.\n\"You are crying! What is the matter?\"\n\n\"I must seem very silly to you, but I am frightfully troubled by what I\nhave just seen.\"\n\n\"You are very good! What would you have of me? I can not sleep. I must\namuse myself a little. And then, girls like me, what does it matter, one\nmore or less? The doctors tell me that the blood I spit up comes from my\nthroat; I pretend to believe them; it is all I can do for them.\"\n\n\"Listen, Marguerite,\" I said, unable to contain myself any longer; \"I do\nnot know what influence you are going to have over my life, but at this\npresent moment there is no one, not even my sister, in whom I feel the\ninterest which I feel in you. It has been just the same ever since I saw\nyou. Well, for Heaven's sake, take care of yourself, and do not live as\nyou are living now.\"\n\n\"If I took care of myself I should die. All that supports me is the\nfeverish life I lead. Then, as for taking care of oneself, that is\nall very well for women with families and friends; as for us, from the\nmoment we can no longer serve the vanity or the pleasure of our lovers,\nthey leave us, and long nights follow long days. I know it. I was in bed\nfor two months, and after three weeks no one came to see me.\"\n\n\"It is true I am nothing to you,\" I went on, \"but if you will let me, I\nwill look after you like a brother, I will never leave your side, and I\nwill cure you. Then, when you are strong again, you can go back to the\nlife you are leading, if you choose; but I am sure you will come to\nprefer a quiet life, which will make you happier and keep your beauty\nunspoiled.\"\n\n\"You think like that to-night because the wine has made you sad, but you\nwould never have the patience that you pretend to.\"\n\n\"Permit me to say, Marguerite, that you were ill for two months, and\nthat for two months I came to ask after you every day.\"\n\n\"It is true, but why did you not come up?\"\n\n\"Because I did not know you then.\"\n\n\"Need you have been so particular with a girl like me?\"\n\n\"One must always be particular with a woman; it is what I feel, at\nleast.\"\n\n\"So you would look after me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You would stay by me all day?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"And even all night?\"\n\n\"As long as I did not weary you.\"\n\n\"And what do you call that?\"\n\n\"Devotion.\"\n\n\"And what does this devotion come from?\"\n\n\"The irresistible sympathy which I have for you.\"\n\n\"So you are in love with me? Say it straight out, it is much more\nsimple.\"\n\n\"It is possible; but if I am to say it to you one day, it is not\nto-day.\"\n\n\"You will do better never to say it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because only one of two things can come of it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Either I shall not accept: then you will have a grudge against me; or\nI shall accept: then you will have a sorry mistress; a woman who is\nnervous, ill, sad, or gay with a gaiety sadder than grief, a woman who\nspits blood and spends a hundred thousand francs a year. That is all\nvery well for a rich old man like the duke, but it is very bad for a\nyoung man like you, and the proof of it is that all the young lovers\nI have had have very soon left me.\" I did not answer; I listened. This\nfrankness, which was almost a kind of confession, the sad life, of which\nI caught some glimpse through the golden veil which covered it, and\nwhose reality the poor girl sought to escape in dissipation, drink,\nand wakefulness, impressed me so deeply that I could not utter a single\nword.\n\n\"Come,\" continued Marguerite, \"we are talking mere childishness. Give me\nyour arm and let us go back to the dining-room. They won't know what we\nmean by our absence.\"\n\n\"Go in, if you like, but allow me to stay here.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because your mirth hurts me.\"\n\n\"Well, I will be sad.\"\n\n\"Marguerite, let me say to you something which you have no doubt often\nheard, so often that the habit of hearing it has made you believe it no\nlonger, but which is none the less real, and which I will never repeat.\"\n\n\"And that is...?\" she said, with the smile of a young mother listening\nto some foolish notion of her child.\n\n\"It is this, that ever since I have seen you, I know not why, you have\ntaken a place in my life; that, if I drive the thought of you out of my\nmind, it always comes back; that when I met you to-day, after not having\nseen you for two years, you made a deeper impression on my heart and\nmind than ever; that, now that you have let me come to see you, now that\nI know you, now that I know all that is strange in you, you have become\na necessity of my life, and you will drive me mad, not only if you will\nnot love me, but if you will not let me love you.\"\n\n\"But, foolish creature that you are, I shall say to you, like Mme. D.,\n'You must be very rich, then!' Why, you don't know that I spend six or\nseven thousand francs a month, and that I could not live without it; you\ndon't know, my poor friend, that I should ruin you in no time, and that\nyour family would cast you off if you were to live with a woman like me.\nLet us be friends, good friends, but no more. Come and see me, we will\nlaugh and talk, but don't exaggerate what I am worth, for I am worth\nvery little. You have a good heart, you want someone to love you, you\nare too young and too sensitive to live in a world like mine. Take a\nmarried woman. You see, I speak to you frankly, like a friend.\"\n\n\"But what the devil are you doing there?\" cried Prudence, who had come\nin without our bearing her, and who now stood just inside the door, with\nher hair half coming down and her dress undone. I recognised the hand of\nGaston.\n\n\"We are talking sense,\" said Marguerite; \"leave us alone; we will be\nback soon.\"\n\n\"Good, good! Talk, my children,\" said Prudence, going out and closing\nthe door behind her, as if to further emphasize the tone in which she\nhad said these words.\n\n\"Well, it is agreed,\" continued Marguerite, when we were alone, \"you\nwon't fall in love with me?\"\n\n\"I will go away.\"\n\n\"So much as that?\"\n\nI had gone too far to draw back; and I was really carried away. This\nmingling of gaiety, sadness, candour, prostitution, her very malady,\nwhich no doubt developed in her a sensitiveness to impressions, as well\nas an irritability of nerves, all this made it clear to me that if from\nthe very beginning I did not completely dominate her light and forgetful\nnature, she was lost to me.\n\n\"Come, now, do you seriously mean what you say?\" she said.\n\n\"Seriously.\"\n\n\"But why didn't you say it to me sooner?\"\n\n\"When could I have said it?\"\n\n\"The day after you had been introduced to me at the Opera Comique.\"\n\n\"I thought you would have received me very badly if I had come to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I had behaved so stupidly.\"\n\n\"That's true. And yet you were already in love with me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that didn't hinder you from going to bed and sleeping quite\ncomfortably. One knows what that sort of love means.\"\n\n\"There you are mistaken. Do you know what I did that evening, after the\nOpera Comique?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I waited for you at the door of the Cafe Anglais. I followed the\ncarriage in which you and your three friends were, and when I saw you\nwere the only one to get down, and that you went in alone, I was very\nhappy.\"\n\nMarguerite began to laugh.\n\n\"What are you laughing at?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell me, I beg of you, or I shall think you are still laughing at me.\"\n\n\"You won't be cross?\"\n\n\"What right have I to be cross?\"\n\n\"Well, there was a sufficient reason why I went in alone.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Some one was waiting for me here.\"\n\nIf she had thrust a knife into me she would not have hurt me more. I\nrose, and holding out my hand, \"Goodbye,\" said I.\n\n\"I knew you would be cross,\" she said; \"men are frantic to know what is\ncertain to give them pain.\"\n\n\"But I assure you,\" I added coldly, as if wishing to prove how\ncompletely I was cured of my passion, \"I assure you that I am not cross.\nIt was quite natural that someone should be waiting for you, just as it\nis quite natural that I should go from here at three in the morning.\"\n\n\"Have you, too, someone waiting for you?\"\n\n\"No, but I must go.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, then.\"\n\n\"You send me away?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Why are you so unkind to me?\"\n\n\"How have I been unkind to you?\"\n\n\"In telling me that someone was waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I could not help laughing at the idea that you had been so happy to see\nme come in alone when there was such a good reason for it.\"\n\n\"One finds pleasure in childish enough things, and it is too bad to\ndestroy such a pleasure when, by simply leaving it alone, one can make\nsomebody so happy.\"\n\n\"But what do you think I am? I am neither maid nor duchess. I didn't\nknow you till to-day, and I am not responsible to you for my actions.\nSupposing one day I should become your mistress, you are bound to know\nthat I have had other lovers besides you. If you make scenes of jealousy\nlike this before, what will it be after, if that after should ever\nexist? I never met anyone like you.\"\n\n\"That is because no one has ever loved you as I love you.\"\n\n\"Frankly, then, you really love me?\"\n\n\"As much as it is possible to love, I think.\"\n\n\"And that has lasted since--?\"\n\n\"Since the day I saw you go into Susse's, three years ago.\"\n\n\"Do you know, that is tremendously fine? Well, what am to do in return?\"\n\n\"Love me a little,\" I said, my heart beating so that I could hardly\nspeak; for, in spite of the half-mocking smiles with which she had\naccompanied the whole conversation, it seemed to me that Marguerite\nbegan to share my agitation, and that the hour so long awaited was\ndrawing near.\n\n\"Well, but the duke?\"\n\n\"What duke?\"\n\n\"My jealous old duke.\"\n\n\"He will know nothing.\"\n\n\"And if he should?\"\n\n\"He would forgive you.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, he would leave me, and what would become of me?\"\n\n\"You risk that for someone else.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" \"By the order you gave not to admit anyone\nto-night.\" \"It is true; but that is a serious friend.\"\n\n\"For whom you care nothing, as you have shut your door against him at\nsuch an hour.\"\n\n\"It is not for you to reproach me, since it was in order to receive you,\nyou and your friend.\"\n\nLittle by little I had drawn nearer to Marguerite. I had put my arms\nabout her waist, and I felt her supple body weigh lightly on my clasped\nhands.\n\n\"If you knew how much I love you!\" I said in a low voice. \"Really true?\"\n\n\"I swear it.\"\n\n\"Well, if you will promise to do everything I tell you, without a word,\nwithout an opinion, without a question, perhaps I will say yes.\"\n\n\"I will do everything that you wish!\"\n\n\"But I forewarn you I must be free to do as I please, without giving you\nthe slightest details what I do. I have long wished for a young lover,\nwho should be young and not self-willed, loving without distrust, loved\nwithout claiming the right to it. I have never found one. Men, instead\nof being satisfied in obtaining for a long time what they scarcely\nhoped to obtain once, exact from their mistresses a full account of the\npresent, the past, and even the future. As they get accustomed to her,\nthey want to rule her, and the more one gives them the more exacting\nthey become. If I decide now on taking a new lover, he must have three\nvery rare qualities: he must be confiding, submissive, and discreet.\"\n\n\"Well, I will be all that you wish.\"\n\n\"We shall see.\"\n\n\"When shall we see?\"\n\n\"Later on.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Marguerite, releasing herself from my arms, and, taking\nfrom a great bunch of red camellias a single camellia, she placed it in\nmy buttonhole, \"because one can not always carry out agreements the day\nthey are signed.\"\n\n\"And when shall I see you again?\" I said, clasping her in my arms.\n\n\"When this camellia changes colour.\"\n\n\"When will it change colour?\"\n\n\"To-morrow night between eleven and twelve. Are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Need you ask me?\"\n\n\"Not a word of this either to your friend or to Prudence, or to anybody\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\"Now, kiss me, and we will go back to the dining-room.\"\n\nShe held up her lips to me, smoothed her hair again, and we went out of\nthe room, she singing, and I almost beside myself.\n\nIn the next room she stopped for a moment and said to me in a low voice:\n\n\"It must seem strange to you that I am ready to take you at a moment's\nnotice. Shall I tell you why? It is,\" she continued, taking my hand\nand placing it against her heart so that I could feel how rapidly and\nviolently it palpitated; \"it is because I shall not live as long as\nothers, and I have promised myself to live more quickly.\"\n\n\"Don't speak to me like that, I entreat you.\"\n\n\"Oh, make yourself easy,\" she continued, laughing; \"however short a time\nI have to live, I shall live longer than you will love me!\"\n\nAnd she went singing into the dining-room.\n\n\"Where is Nanine?\" she said, seeing Gaston and Prudence alone.\n\n\"She is asleep in your room, waiting till you are ready to go to bed,\"\nreplied Prudence.\n\n\"Poor thing, I am killing her! And now gentlemen, it is time to go.\"\n\nTen minutes after, Gaston and I left the house. Marguerite shook hands\nwith me and said good-bye. Prudence remained behind.\n\n\"Well,\" said Gaston, when we were in the street, \"what do you think of\nMarguerite?\"\n\n\"She is an angel, and I am madly in love with her.\" \"So I guessed; did\nyou tell her so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And did she promise to believe you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"She is not like Prudence.\"\n\n\"Did she promise to?\"\n\n\"Better still, my dear fellow. You wouldn't think it; but she is still\nnot half bad, poor old Duvernoy!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\nAt this point Armand stopped.\n\n\"Would you close the window for me?\" he said. \"I am beginning to feel\ncold. Meanwhile, I will get into bed.\"\n\nI closed the window. Armand, who was still very weak, took off his\ndressing-gown and lay down in bed, resting his head for a few moments\non the pillow, like a man who is tired by much talking or disturbed by\npainful memories.\n\n\"Perhaps you have been talking too much,\" I said to him. \"Would you\nrather for me to go and leave you to sleep? You can tell me the rest of\nthe story another day.\"\n\n\"Are you tired of listening to it?\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary.\"\n\n\"Then I will go on. If you left me alone, I should not sleep.\"\n\nWhen I returned home (he continued, without needing to pause and\nrecollect himself, so fresh were all the details in his mind), I did not\ngo to bed, but began to reflect over the day's adventure. The meeting,\nthe introduction, the promise of Marguerite, had followed one another so\nrapidly, and so unexpectedly, that there were moments when it seemed to\nme I had been dreaming. Nevertheless, it was not the first time that a\ngirl like Marguerite had promised herself to a man on the morrow of the\nday on which he had asked for the promise.\n\nThough, indeed, I made this reflection, the first impression produced\non me by my future mistress was so strong that it still persisted. I\nrefused obstinately to see in her a woman like other women, and, with\nthe vanity so common to all men, I was ready to believe that she could\nnot but share the attraction which drew me to her.\n\nYet, I had before me plenty of instances to the contrary, and I had\noften heard that the affection of Marguerite was a thing to be had more\nor less dear, according to the season.\n\nBut, on the other hand, how was I to reconcile this reputation with her\nconstant refusal of the young count whom we had found at her house? You\nmay say that he was unattractive to her, and that, as she was splendidly\nkept by the duke, she would be more likely to choose a man who was\nattractive to her, if she were to take another lover. If so, why did she\nnot choose Gaston, who was rich, witty, and charming, and why did she\ncare for me, whom she had thought so ridiculous the first time she had\nseen me?\n\nIt is true that there are events of a moment which tell more than the\ncourtship of a year. Of those who were at the supper, I was the only one\nwho had been concerned at her leaving the table. I had followed her, I\nhad been so affected as to be unable to hide it from her, I had wept as\nI kissed her hand. This circumstance, added to my daily visits during\nthe two months of her illness, might have shown her that I was somewhat\ndifferent from the other men she knew, and perhaps she had said to\nherself that for a love which could thus manifest itself she might well\ndo what she had done so often that it had no more consequence for her.\n\nAll these suppositions, as you may see, were improbable enough; but\nwhatever might have been the reason of her consent, one thing was\ncertain, she had consented.\n\nNow, I was in love with Marguerite. I had nothing more to ask of her.\nNevertheless, though she was only a kept woman, I had so anticipated for\nmyself, perhaps to poetize it a little, a hopeless love, that the nearer\nthe moment approached when I should have nothing more to hope, the more\nI doubted. I did not close my eyes all night.\n\nI scarcely knew myself. I was half demented. Now, I seemed to myself not\nhandsome or rich or elegant enough to possess such a woman, now I was\nfilled with vanity at the thought of it; then I began to fear lest\nMarguerite had no more than a few days' caprice for me, and I said to\nmyself that since we should soon have to part, it would be better not to\nkeep her appointment, but to write and tell her my fears and leave her.\nFrom that I went on to unlimited hope, unbounded confidence. I dreamed\nincredible dreams of the future; I said to myself that she should owe\nto me her moral and physical recovery, that I should spend my whole life\nwith her, and that her love should make me happier than all the maidenly\nloves in the world.\n\nBut I can not repeat to you the thousand thoughts that rose from my\nheart to my head, and that only faded away with the sleep that came to\nme at daybreak.\n\nWhen I awoke it was two o'clock. The weather was superb. I don't think\nlife ever seemed to me so beautiful and so full of possibilities. The\nmemories of the night before came to me without shadow or hindrance,\nescorted gaily by the hopes of the night to come. From time to time my\nheart leaped with love and joy in my breast. A sweet fever thrilled\nme. I thought no more of the reasons which had filled my mind before I\nslept. I saw only the result, I thought only of the hour when I was to\nsee Marguerite again.\n\nIt was impossible to stay indoors. My room seemed too small to contain\nmy happiness. I needed the whole of nature to unbosom myself.\n\nI went out. Passing by the Rue d'Antin, I saw Marguerite's coupe'\nwaiting for her at the door. I went toward the Champs-Elysees. I loved\nall the people whom I met. Love gives one a kind of goodness.\n\nAfter I had been walking for an hour from the Marly horses to the\nRond-Point, I saw Marguerite's carriage in the distance; I divined\nrather than recognised it. As it was turning the corner of the\nChamps-Elysees it stopped, and a tall young man left a group of people\nwith whom he was talking and came up to her. They talked for a few\nmoments; the young man returned to his friends, the horses set out\nagain, and as I came near the group I recognised the one who had spoken\nto Marguerite as the Comte de G., whose portrait I had seen and whom\nPrudence had indicated to me as the man to whom Marguerite owed her\nposition. It was to him that she had closed her doors the night before;\nI imagined that she had stopped her carriage in order to explain to him\nwhy she had done so, and I hoped that at the same time she had found\nsome new pretext for not receiving him on the following night.\n\nHow I spent the rest of the day I do not know; I walked, smoked, talked,\nbut what I said, whom I met, I had utterly forgotten by ten o'clock in\nthe evening.\n\nAll I remember is that when I returned home, I spent three hours over\nmy toilet, and I looked at my watch and my clock a hundred times, which\nunfortunately both pointed to the same hour.\n\nWhen it struck half past ten, I said to myself that it was time to go.\n\nI lived at that time in the Rue de Provence; I followed the Rue du\nMont-Blanc, crossed the Boulevard, went up the Rue Louis-le-Grand, the\nRue de Port-Mahon, and the Rue d'Antin. I looked up at Marguerite's\nwindows. There was a light. I rang. I asked the porter if Mlle. Gautier\nwas at home. He replied that she never came in before eleven or a\nquarter past eleven. I looked at my watch. I intended to come quite\nslowly, and I had come in five minutes from the Rue de Provence to the\nRue d'Antin.\n\nI walked to and fro in the street; there are no shops, and at that hour\nit is quite deserted. In half an hour's time Marguerite arrived. She\nlooked around her as she got down from her coupe, as if she were\nlooking for someone. The carriage drove off; the stables were not at\nthe house. Just as Marguerite was going to ring, I went up to her and\nsaid, \"Good-evening.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is you,\" she said, in a tone that by no means reassured me as to\nher pleasure in seeing me.\n\n\"Did you not promise me that I might come and see you to-day?\"\n\n\"Quite right. I had forgotten.\"\n\nThis word upset all the reflections I had had during the day.\nNevertheless, I was beginning to get used to her ways, and I did not\nleave her, as I should certainly have done once. We entered. Nanine had\nalready opened the door.\n\n\"Has Prudence come?\" said Marguerite.\n\n\"No, madame.\"\n\n\"Say that she is to be admitted as soon as she comes. But first put out\nthe lamp in the drawing-room, and if anyone comes, say that I have not\ncome back and shall not be coming back.\"\n\nShe was like a woman who is preoccupied with something, and perhaps\nannoyed by an unwelcome guest. I did not know what to do or say.\nMarguerite went toward her bedroom; I remained where I was.\n\n\"Come,\" she said.\n\nShe took off her hat and her velvet cloak and threw them on the bed,\nthen let herself drop into a great armchair beside the fire, which she\nkept till the very beginning of summer, and said to me as she fingered\nher watch-chain:\n\n\"Well, what news have you got for me?\"\n\n\"None, except that I ought not to have come to-night.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you seem vexed, and no doubt I am boring you.\"\n\n\"You are not boring me; only I am not well; I have been suffering all\nday. I could not sleep, and I have a frightful headache.\"\n\n\"Shall I go away and let you go to bed?\"\n\n\"Oh, you can stay. If I want to go to bed I don't mind your being here.\"\n\nAt that moment there was a ring.\n\n\"Who is coming now?\" she said, with an impatient movement.\n\nA few minutes after there was another ring.\n\n\"Isn't there anyone to go to the door? I shall have to go.\" She got up\nand said to me, \"Wait here.\"\n\nShe went through the rooms, and I heard her open the outer door. I\nlistened.\n\nThe person whom she had admitted did not come farther than the\ndining-room. At the first word I recognised the voice of the young Comte\nde N.\n\n\"How are you this evening?\" he said.\n\n\"Not well,\" replied Marguerite drily.\n\n\"Am I disturbing you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\n\n\"How you receive me! What have I done, my dear Marguerite?\"\n\n\"My dear friend, you have done nothing. I am ill; I must go to bed, so\nyou will be good enough to go. It is sickening not to be able to return\nat night without your making your appearance five minutes afterward.\nWhat is it you want? For me to be your mistress? Well, I have already\ntold you a hundred times, No; you simply worry me, and you might as well\ngo somewhere else. I repeat to you to-day, for the last time, I don't\nwant to have anything to do with you; that's settled. Good-bye. Here's\nNanine coming in; she can light you to the door. Good-night.\"\n\nWithout adding another word, or listening to what the young man\nstammered out, Marguerite returned to the room and slammed the door.\nNanine entered a moment after.\n\n\"Now understand,\" said Marguerite, \"you are always to say to that idiot\nthat I am not in, or that I will not see him. I am tired out with seeing\npeople who always want the same thing; who pay me for it, and then think\nthey are quit of me. If those who are going to go in for our hateful\nbusiness only knew what it really was they would sooner be chambermaids.\nBut no, vanity, the desire of having dresses and carriages and diamonds\ncarries us away; one believes what one hears, for here, as elsewhere,\nthere is such a thing as belief, and one uses up one's heart, one's\nbody, one's beauty, little by little; one is feared like a beast of\nprey, scorned like a pariah, surrounded by people who always take more\nthan they give; and one fine day one dies like a dog in a ditch, after\nhaving ruined others and ruined one's self.\"\n\n\"Come, come, madame, be calm,\" said Nanine; \"your nerves are a bit upset\nto-night.\"\n\n\"This dress worries me,\" continued Marguerite, unhooking her bodice;\n\"give me a dressing-gown. Well, and Prudence?\"\n\n\"She has not come yet, but I will send her to you, madame, the moment\nshe comes.\"\n\n\"There's one, now,\" Marguerite went on, as she took off her dress and\nput on a white dressing-gown, \"there's one who knows very well how to\nfind me when she is in want of me, and yet she can't do me a service\ndecently. She knows I am waiting for an answer. She knows how anxious I\nam, and I am sure she is going about on her own account, without giving\na thought to me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she had to wait.\"\n\n\"Let us have some punch.\"\n\n\"It will do you no good, madame,\" said Nanine.\n\n\"So much the better. Bring some fruit, too, and a pate or a wing of\nchicken; something or other, at once. I am hungry.\"\n\nNeed I tell you the impression which this scene made upon me, or can you\nnot imagine it?\n\n\"You are going to have supper with me,\" she said to me; \"meanwhile, take\na book. I am going into my dressing-room for a moment.\"\n\nShe lit the candles of a candelabra, opened a door at the foot of the\nbed, and disappeared.\n\nI began to think over this poor girl's life, and my love for her was\nmingled with a great pity. I walked to and fro in the room, thinking\nover things, when Prudence entered.\n\n\"Ah, you here?\"' she said, \"where is Marguerite?\"\n\n\"In her dressing-room.\"\n\n\"I will wait. By the way, do you know she thinks you charming?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"She hasn't told you?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"How are you here?\"\n\n\"I have come to pay her a visit.\"\n\n\"At midnight?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Farceur!\"\n\n\"She has received me, as a matter of fact, very badly.\"\n\n\"She will receive you better by and bye.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I have some good news for her.\"\n\n\"No harm in that. So she has spoken to you about me?\"\n\n\"Last night, or rather to-night, when you and your friend went. By the\nway, what is your friend called? Gaston R., his name is, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, not without smiling, as I thought of what Gaston had\nconfided to me, and saw that Prudence scarcely even knew his name.\n\n\"He is quite nice, that fellow; what does he do?\"\n\n\"He has twenty-five thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed! Well, to return to you. Marguerite asked me all about\nyou: who you were, what you did, what mistresses you had had; in short,\neverything that one could ask about a man of your age. I told her all I\nknew, and added that you were a charming young man. That's all.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Now tell me what it was she wanted to say to you last night.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. It was only to get rid of the count; but I have really\nsomething to see her about to-day, and I am bringing her an answer now.\"\n\nAt this moment Marguerite reappeared from her dressing-room, wearing a\ncoquettish little nightcap with bunches of yellow ribbons, technically\nknown as \"cabbages.\" She looked ravishing. She had satin slippers on her\nbare feet, and was in the act of polishing her nails.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, seeing Prudence, \"have you seen the duke?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"And what did he say to you?\"\n\n\"He gave me--\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Six thousand.\"\n\n\"Have you got it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Did he seem put out?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\"\n\nThis \"Poor man!\" was said in a tone impossible to render. Marguerite\ntook the six notes of a thousand francs.\n\n\"It was quite time,\" she said. \"My dear Prudence, are you in want of any\nmoney?\"\n\n\"You know, my child, it is the 15th in a couple of days, so if you could\nlend me three or four hundred francs, you would do me a real service.\"\n\n\"Send over to-morrow; it is too late to get change now.\"\n\n\"Don't forget.\"\n\n\"No fear. Will you have supper with us?\"\n\n\"No, Charles is waiting for me.\"\n\n\"You are still devoted to him?\"\n\n\"Crazy, my dear! I will see you to-morrow. Good-bye, Armand.\"\n\nMme. Duvernoy went out.\n\nMarguerite opened the drawer of a side-table and threw the bank-notes\ninto it.\n\n\"Will you permit me to get into bed?\" she said with a smile, as she\nmoved toward the bed.\n\n\"Not only permit, but I beg of you.\"\n\nShe turned back the covering and got into bed.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, \"come and sit down by me, and let's have a talk.\"\n\nPrudence was right: the answer that she had brought to Marguerite had\nput her into a good humour.\n\n\"Will you forgive me for my bad temper tonight?\" she said, taking my\nhand.\n\n\"I am ready to forgive you as often as you like.\"\n\n\"And you love me?\"\n\n\"Madly.\"\n\n\"In spite of my bad disposition?\"\n\n\"In spite of all.\"\n\n\"You swear it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said in a whisper.\n\nNanine entered, carrying plates, a cold chicken, a bottle of claret, and\nsome strawberries.\n\n\"I haven't had any punch made,\" said Nanine; \"claret is better for you.\nIsn't it, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, still under the excitement of Marguerite's last\nwords, my eyes fixed ardently upon her.\n\n\"Good,\" said she; \"put it all on the little table, and draw it up to the\nbed; we will help ourselves. This is the third night you have sat up,\nand you must be in want of sleep. Go to bed. I don't want anything\nmore.\"\n\n\"Shall I lock the door?\"\n\n\"I should think so! And above all, tell them not to admit anybody before\nmidday.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning, as the light began to appear through the\ncurtains, Marguerite said to me: \"Forgive me if I send you away; but I\nmust. The duke comes every morning; they will tell him, when he comes,\nthat I am asleep, and perhaps he will wait until I wake.\"\n\nI took Marguerite's head in my hands; her loosened hair streamed about\nher; I gave her a last kiss, saying: \"When shall I see you again?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" she said; \"take the little gilt key on the mantelpiece, open\nthat door; bring me back the key and go. In the course of the day\nyou shall have a letter, and my orders, for you know you are to obey\nblindly.\"\n\n\"Yes; but if I should already ask for something?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Let me have that key.\"\n\n\"What you ask is a thing I have never done for anyone.\"\n\n\"Well, do it for me, for I swear to you that I don't love you as the\nothers have loved you.\"\n\n\"Well, keep it; but it only depends on me to make it useless to you,\nafter all.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"There are bolts on the door.\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\n\"I will have them taken off.\"\n\n\"You love, then, a little?\"\n\n\"I don't know how it is, but it seems to me as if I do! Now, go; I can't\nkeep my eyes open.\"\n\nI held her in my arms for a few seconds and then went.\n\nThe streets were empty, the great city was still asleep, a sweet\nfreshness circulated in the streets that a few hours later would be\nfilled with the noise of men. It seemed to me as if this sleeping\ncity belonged to me; I searched my memory for the names of those whose\nhappiness I had once envied; and I could not recall one without finding\nmyself the happier.\n\nTo be loved by a pure young girl, to be the first to reveal to her the\nstrange mystery of love, is indeed a great happiness, but it is the\nsimplest thing in the world. To take captive a heart which has had no\nexperience of attack, is to enter an unfortified and ungarrisoned city.\nEducation, family feeling, the sense of duty, the family, are strong\nsentinels, but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived\nby a girl of sixteen to whom nature, by the voice of the man she loves,\ngives the first counsels of love, all the more ardent because they seem\nso pure.\n\nThe more a girl believes in goodness, the more easily will she give way,\nif not to her lover, at least to love, for being without mistrust she\nis without force, and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained\nby any young man of five-and-twenty. See how young girls are watched\nand guarded! The walls of convents are not high enough, mothers have\nno locks strong enough, religion has no duties constant enough, to shut\nthese charming birds in their cages, cages not even strewn with flowers.\nThen how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them,\nhow surely must they find it tempting, how surely must they listen to\nthe first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars, and\nbless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mysterious\nveil!\n\nBut to be really loved by a courtesan: that is a victory of infinitely\ngreater difficulty. With them the body has worn out the soul, the senses\nhave burned up the heart, dissipation has blunted the feelings. They\nhave long known the words that we say to them, the means we use; they\nhave sold the love that they inspire. They love by profession, and not\nby instinct. They are guarded better by their calculations than a virgin\nby her mother and her convent; and they have invented the word caprice\nfor that unbartered love which they allow themselves from time to time,\nfor a rest, for an excuse, for a consolation, like usurers, who cheat\na thousand, and think they have bought their own redemption by once\nlending a sovereign to a poor devil who is dying of hunger without\nasking for interest or a receipt.\n\nThen, when God allows love to a courtesan, that love, which at first\nseems like a pardon, becomes for her almost without penitence. When a\ncreature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at\nonce by a profound, sincere, irresistible love, of which she had never\nfelt herself capable; when she has confessed her love, how absolutely\nthe man whom she loves dominates her! How strong he feels with his cruel\nright to say: You do no more for love than you have done for money.\nThey know not what proof to give. A child, says the fable, having\noften amused himself by crying \"Help! a wolf!\" in order to disturb the\nlabourers in the field, was one day devoured by a Wolf, because those\nwhom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help.\nIt is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously. They\nhave lied so often that no one will believe them, and in the midst of\ntheir remorse they are devoured by their love.\n\nHence those great devotions, those austere retreats from the world, of\nwhich some of them have given an example.\n\nBut when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in\nsoul to receive it without remembering the past, when he gives himself\nup to it, when, in short, he loves as he is loved, this man drains at\none draught all earthly emotions, and after such a love his heart will\nbe closed to every other.\n\nI did not make these reflections on the morning when I returned home.\nThey could but have been the presentiment of what was to happen to\nme, and, despite my love for Marguerite, I did not foresee such\nconsequences. I make these reflections to-day. Now that all is\nirrevocably ended, they a rise naturally out of what has taken place.\n\nBut to return to the first day of my liaison. When I reached home I\nwas in a state of mad gaiety. As I thought of how the barriers which my\nimagination had placed between Marguerite and myself had disappeared, of\nhow she was now mine; of the place I now had in her thoughts, of the key\nto her room which I had in my pocket, and of my right to use this key, I\nwas satisfied with life, proud of myself, and I loved God because he had\nlet such things be.\n\nOne day a young man is passing in the street, he brushes against a\nwoman, looks at her, turns, goes on his way. He does not know the woman,\nand she has pleasures, griefs, loves, in which he has no part. He does\nnot exist for her, and perhaps, if he spoke to her, she would only laugh\nat him, as Marguerite had laughed at me. Weeks, months, years pass, and\nall at once, when they have each followed their fate along a different\npath, the logic of chance brings them face to face. The woman becomes\nthe man's mistress and loves him. How? why? Their two existences are\nhenceforth one; they have scarcely begun to know one another when it\nseems as if they had known one another always, and all that had gone\nbefore is wiped out from the memory of the two lovers. It is curious,\none must admit.\n\nAs for me, I no longer remembered how I had lived before that night.\nMy whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had\nexchanged during that first night. Either Marguerite was very clever\nin deception, or she had conceived for me one of those sudden passions\nwhich are revealed in the first kiss, and which die, often enough, as\nsuddenly as they were born.\n\nThe more I reflected the more I said to myself that Marguerite had no\nreason for feigning a love which she did not feel, and I said to myself\nalso that women have two ways of loving, one of which may arise from the\nother: they love with the heart or with the senses. Often a woman takes\na lover in obedience to the mere will of the senses, and learns without\nexpecting it the mystery of immaterial love, and lives henceforth only\nthrough her heart; often a girl who has sought in marriage only the\nunion of two pure affections receives the sudden revelation of physical\nlove, that energetic conclusion of the purest impressions of the soul.\n\nIn the midst of these thoughts I fell asleep; I was awakened by a letter\nfrom Marguerite containing these words:\n\n\"Here are my orders: To-night at the Vaudeville.\n\n\"Come during the third entr'acte.\"\n\nI put the letter into a drawer, so that I might always have it at band\nin case I doubted its reality, as I did from time to time.\n\nShe did not tell me to come to see her during the day, and I dared not\ngo; but I had so great a desire to see her before the evening that I\nwent to the Champs-Elysees, where I again saw her pass and repass, as I\nhad on the previous day.\n\nAt seven o'clock I was at the Vaudeville. Never had I gone to a theatre\nso early. The boxes filled one after another. Only one remained empty,\nthe stage box. At the beginning of the third act I heard the door of\nthe box, on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed, open, and\nMarguerite appeared. She came to the front at once, looked around the\nstalls, saw me, and thanked me with a look.\n\nThat night she was marvellously beautiful. Was I the cause of this\ncoquetry? Did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she\nlooked the happier I should be? I did not know, but if that had been\nher intention she certainly succeeded, for when she appeared all heads\nturned, and the actor who was then on the stage looked to see who had\nproduced such an effect on the audience by her mere presence there.\n\nAnd I had the key of this woman's room, and in three or four hours she\nwould again be mine!\n\nPeople blame those who let themselves be ruined by actresses and kept\nwomen; what astonishes me is that twenty times greater follies are not\ncommitted for them. One must have lived that life, as I have, to know\nhow much the little vanities which they afford their lovers every day\nhelp to fasten deeper into the heart, since we have no other word for\nit, the love which he has for them.\n\nPrudence next took her place in the box, and a man, whom I recognised as\nthe Comte de G., seated himself at the back. As I saw him, a cold shiver\nwent through my heart.\n\nDoubtless Marguerite perceived the impression made on me by the presence\nof this man, for she smiled to me again, and, turning her back to the\ncount, appeared to be very attentive to the play. At the third entr'acte\nshe turned and said two words: the count left the box, and Marguerite\nbeckoned to me to come to her.\n\n\"Good-evening,\" she said as I entered, holding out her hand.\n\n\"Good-evening,\" I replied to both Marguerite and Prudence.\n\n\"Sit down.\"\n\n\"But I am taking someone's place. Isn't the Comte de G. coming back?\"\n\n\"Yes; I sent him to fetch some sweets, so that we could talk by\nourselves for a moment. Mme. Duvernoy is in the secret.\"\n\n\"Yes, my children,\" said she; \"have no fear. I shall say nothing.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you to-night?\" said Marguerite, rising and\ncoming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead.\n\n\"I am not very well.\"\n\n\"You should go to bed,\" she replied, with that ironical air which went\nso well with her delicate and witty face.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At home.\"\n\n\"You know that I shouldn't be able to sleep there.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it won't do for you to come and be pettish here because you\nhave seen a man in my box.\"\n\n\"It is not for that reason.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. I know; and you are wrong, so let us say no more about\nit. You will go back with Prudence after the theatre, and you will stay\nthere till I call. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHow could I disobey?\n\n\"You still love me?\"\n\n\"Can you ask?\"\n\n\"You have thought of me?\"\n\n\"All day long.\"\n\n\"Do you know that I am really afraid that I shall get very fond of you?\nAsk Prudence.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said she, \"it is amazing!\"\n\n\"Now, you must go back to your seat. The count will be coming back, and\nthere is nothing to be gained by his finding you here.\"\n\n\"Because you don't like seeing him.\"\n\n\"No; only if you had told me that you wanted to come to the Vaudeville\nto-night I could have got this box for you as well as he.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, he got it for me without my asking him, and he asked me\nto go with him; you know well enough that I couldn't refuse. All I could\ndo was to write and tell you where I was going, so that you could see\nme, and because I wanted to see you myself; but since this is the way\nyou thank me, I shall profit by the lesson.\"\n\n\"I was wrong; forgive me.\"\n\n\"Well and good; and now go back nicely to your place, and, above all, no\nmore jealousy.\"\n\nShe kissed me again, and I left the box. In the passage I met the count\ncoming back. I returned to my seat.\n\nAfter all, the presence of M. de G. in Marguerite's box was the most\nnatural thing in the world. He had been her lover, he sent her a box, he\naccompanied her to the theatre; it was all quite natural, and if I was\nto have a mistress like Marguerite I should have to get used to her\nways.\n\nNonetheless, I was very unhappy all the rest of the evening, and went\naway very sadly after having seen Prudence, the count, and Marguerite\nget into the carriage, which was waiting for them at the door.\n\nHowever, a quarter of an hour later I was at Prudence's. She had only\njust got in.\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\"You have come almost as quickly as we,\" said Prudence.\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered mechanically. \"Where is Marguerite?\"\n\n\"At home.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"With M. de G.\"\n\nI walked to and fro in the room.\n\n\"Well, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Do you think it amuses me to wait here till M. de G. leaves\nMarguerite's?\"\n\n\"How unreasonable you are! Don't you see that Marguerite can't turn the\ncount out of doors? M. de G. has been with her for a long time; he has\nalways given her a lot of money; he still does. Marguerite spends more\nthan a hundred thousand francs a year; she has heaps of debts. The duke\ngives her all that she asks for, but she does not always venture to ask\nhim for all that she is in want of. It would never do for her to quarrel\nwith the count, who is worth to her at least ten thousand francs a year.\nMarguerite is very fond of you, my dear fellow, but your liaison with\nher, in her interests and in yours, ought not to be serious. You with\nyour seven or eight thousand francs a year, what could you do toward\nsupplying all the luxuries which a girl like that is in need of? It\nwould not be enough to keep her carriage. Take Marguerite for what\nshe is, for a good, bright, pretty girl; be her lover for a month, two\nmonths; give her flowers, sweets, boxes at the theatre; but don't\nget any other ideas into your head, and don't make absurd scenes of\njealousy. You know whom you have to do with; Marguerite isn't a saint.\nShe likes you, you are very fond of her; let the rest alone. You amaze\nme when I see you so touchy; you have the most charming mistress in\nParis. She receives you in the greatest style, she is covered with\ndiamonds, she needn't cost you a penny, unless you like, and you are not\nsatisfied. My dear fellow, you ask too much!\"\n\n\"You are right, but I can't help it; the idea that that man is her lover\nhurts me horribly.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" replied Prudence; \"is he still her lover? He is a\nman who is useful to her, nothing more. She has closed her doors to him\nfor two days; he came this morning--she could not but accept the box and\nlet him accompany her. He saw her home; he has gone in for a moment, he\nis not staying, because you are waiting here. All that, it seems to me,\nis quite natural. Besides, you don't mind the duke.\"\n\n\"Yes; but he is an old man, and I am sure that Marguerite is not his\nmistress. Then, it is all very well to accept one liaison, but not two.\nSuch easiness in the matter is very like calculation, and puts the man\nwho consents to it, even out of love, very much in the category of those\nwho, in a lower stage of society, make a trade of their connivance, and\na profit of their trade.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear fellow, how old-fashioned you are! How many of the richest\nand most fashionable men of the best families I have seen quite ready\nto do what I advise you to do, and without an effort, without shame,\nwithout remorse, Why, one sees it every day. How do you suppose the kept\nwomen in Paris could live in the style they do, if they had not three or\nfour lovers at once? No single fortune, however large, could suffice\nfor the expenses of a woman like Marguerite. A fortune of five hundred\nthousand francs a year is, in France, an enormous fortune; well, my dear\nfriend, five hundred thousand francs a year would still be too little,\nand for this reason: a man with such an income has a large house,\nhorses, servants, carriages; he shoots, has friends, often he is\nmarried, he has children, he races, gambles, travels, and what not. All\nthese habits are so much a part of his position that he can not forego\nthem without appearing to have lost all his money, and without causing\nscandal. Taking it all round, with five hundred thousand francs a year\nhe can not give a woman more than forty or fifty thousand francs in the\nyear, and that is already a good deal. Well, other lovers make up for\nthe rest of her expenses. With Marguerite, it is still more convenient;\nshe has chanced by a miracle on an old man worth ten millions, whose\nwife and daughter are dead; who has only some nephews, themselves rich,\nand who gives her all she wants without asking anything in return. But\nshe can not ask him for more than seventy thousand francs a year; and\nI am sure that if she did ask for more, despite his health and the\naffection he has for her he would not give it to her.\n\n\"All the young men of twenty or thirty thousand francs a year at Paris,\nthat is to say, men who have only just enough to live on in the society\nin which they mix, know perfectly well, when they are the lovers of a\nwoman like Marguerite, that she could not so much as pay for the rooms\nshe lives in and the servants who wait upon her with what they give\nher. They do not say to her that they know it; they pretend not to see\nanything, and when they have had enough of it they go their way. If they\nhave the vanity to wish to pay for everything they get ruined, like the\nfools they are, and go and get killed in Africa, after leaving a hundred\nthousand francs of debt in Paris. Do you think a woman is grateful\nto them for it? Far from it. She declares that she has sacrificed her\nposition for them, and that while she was with them she was losing\nmoney. These details seem to you shocking? Well, they are true. You are\na very nice fellow; I like you very much. I have lived with these women\nfor twenty years; I know what they are worth, and I don't want to see\nyou take the caprice that a pretty girl has for you too seriously.\n\n\"Then, besides that,\" continued Prudence; \"admit that Marguerite loves\nyou enough to give up the count or the duke, in case one of them were to\ndiscover your liaison and to tell her to choose between him and you,\nthe sacrifice that she would make for you would be enormous, you can not\ndeny it. What equal sacrifice could you make for her, on your part, and\nwhen you had got tired of her, what could you do to make up for what you\nhad taken from her? Nothing. You would have cut her off from the world\nin which her fortune and her future were to be found; she would have\ngiven you her best years, and she would be forgotten. Either you would\nbe an ordinary man, and, casting her past in her teeth, you would leave\nher, telling her that you were only doing like her other lovers, and you\nwould abandon her to certain misery; or you would be an honest man, and,\nfeeling bound to keep her by you, you would bring inevitable trouble\nupon yourself, for a liaison which is excusable in a young man, is no\nlonger excusable in a man of middle age. It becomes an obstacle to every\nthing; it allows neither family nor ambition, man's second and last\nloves. Believe me, then, my friend, take things for what they are worth,\nand do not give a kept woman the right to call herself your creditor, no\nmatter in what.\"\n\nIt was well argued, with a logic of which I should have thought Prudence\nincapable. I had nothing to reply, except that she was right; I took her\nhand and thanked her for her counsels.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said she, \"put these foolish theories to flight, and\nlaugh over them. Life is pleasant, my dear fellow; it all depends on the\ncolour of the glass through which one sees it. Ask your friend Gaston;\nthere's a man who seems to me to understand love as I understand it. All\nthat you need think of, unless you are quite a fool, is that close by\nthere is a beautiful girl who is waiting impatiently for the man who is\nwith her to go, thinking of you, keeping the whole night for you, and\nwho loves you, I am certain. Now, come to the window with me, and let us\nwatch for the count to go; he won't be long in leaving the coast clear.\"\n\nPrudence opened the window, and we leaned side by side over the balcony.\nShe watched the few passers, I reflected. All that she had said buzzed\nin my head, and I could not help feeling that she was right; but\nthe genuine love which I had for Marguerite had some difficulty in\naccommodating itself to such a belief. I sighed from time to time, at\nwhich Prudence turned, and shrugged her shoulders like a physician who\nhas given up his patient.\n\n\"How one realizes the shortness of life,\" I said to myself, \"by the\nrapidity of sensations! I have only known Marguerite for two days,\nshe has only been my mistress since yesterday, and she has already so\ncompletely absorbed my thoughts, my heart, and my life that the visit of\nthe Comte de G. is a misfortune for me.\"\n\nAt last the count came out, got into his carriage and disappeared.\nPrudence closed the window. At the same instant Marguerite called to us:\n\n\"Come at once,\" she said; \"they are laying the table, and we'll have\nsupper.\"\n\nWhen I entered, Marguerite ran to me, threw her arms around my neck and\nkissed me with all her might.\n\n\"Are we still sulky?\" she said to me.\n\n\"No, it is all over,\" replied Prudence. \"I have given him a talking to,\nand he has promised to be reasonable.\"\n\n\"Well and good.\"\n\nIn spite of myself I glanced at the bed; it was not unmade. As for\nMarguerite, she was already in her white dressing-gown. We sat down to\ntable.\n\nCharm, sweetness, spontaneity, Marguerite had them all, and I was forced\nfrom time to time to admit that I had no right to ask of her anything\nelse; that many people would be very happy to be in my place; and that,\nlike Virgil's shepherd, I had only to enjoy the pleasures that a god, or\nrather a goddess, set before me.\n\nI tried to put in practice the theories of Prudence, and to be as gay\nas my two companions; but what was natural in them was on my part an\neffort, and the nervous laughter, whose source they did not detect, was\nnearer to tears than to mirth.\n\nAt last the supper was over and I was alone with Marguerite. She sat\ndown as usual on the hearthrug before the fire and gazed sadly into the\nflames. What was she thinking of? I know not. As for me, I looked at her\nwith a mingling of love and terror, as I thought of all that I was ready\nto suffer for her sake.\n\n\"Do you know what I am thinking of?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Of a plan that has come into my head.\"\n\n\"And what is this plan?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you yet, but I can tell you what the result would be. The\nresult would be that in a month I should be free, I should have no more\ndebts, and we could go and spend the summer in the country.\"\n\n\"And you can't tell me by what means?\"\n\n\"No, only love me as I love you, and all will succeed.\"\n\n\"And have you made this plan all by yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you will carry it out all by yourself?\"\n\n\"I alone shall have the trouble of it,\" said Marguerite, with a smile\nwhich I shall never forget, \"but we shall both partake its benefits.\"\n\nI could not help flushing at the word benefits; I thought of Manon\nLescaut squandering with Desgrieux the money of M. de B.\n\nI replied in a hard voice, rising from my seat:\n\n\"You must permit me, my dear Marguerite, to share only the benefits of\nthose enterprises which I have conceived and carried out myself.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means that I have a strong suspicion that M. de G. is to be your\nassociate in this pretty plan, of which I can accept neither the cost\nnor the benefits.\"\n\n\"What a child you are! I thought you loved me. I was mistaken; all\nright.\"\n\nShe rose, opened the piano and began to play the \"Invitation a la Valse\",\nas far as the famous passage in the major which always stopped her. Was\nit through force of habit, or was it to remind me of the day when we\nfirst met? All I know is that the melody brought back that recollection,\nand, coming up to her, I took her head between my hands and kissed her.\n\"You forgive me?\" I said.\n\n\"You see I do,\" she answered; \"but observe that we are only at our\nsecond day, and already I have had to forgive you something. Is this how\nyou keep your promise of blind obedience?\"\n\n\"What can I do, Marguerite? I love you too much and I am jealous of the\nleast of your thoughts. What you proposed to me just now made me frantic\nwith delight, but the mystery in its carrying out hurts me dreadfully.\"\n\n\"Come, let us reason it out,\" she said, taking both my hands and looking\nat me with a charming smile which it was impossible to resist, \"You love\nme, do you not? and you would gladly spend two or three months alone\nwith me in the country? I too should be glad of this solitude a deux,\nand not only glad of it, but my health requires it. I can not leave\nParis for such a length of time without putting my affairs in order, and\nthe affairs of a woman like me are always in great confusion; well, I\nhave found a way to reconcile everything, my money affairs and my love\nfor you; yes, for you, don't laugh; I am silly enough to love you! And\nhere you are taking lordly airs and talking big words. Child, thrice\nchild, only remember that I love you, and don't let anything disturb\nyou. Now, is it agreed?\"\n\n\"I agree to all you wish, as you know.\"\n\n\"Then, in less than a month's time we shall be in some village,\nwalking by the river side, and drinking milk. Does it seem strange\nthat Marguerite Gautier should speak to you like that? The fact is,\nmy friend, that when this Paris life, which seems to make me so happy,\ndoesn't burn me, it wearies me, and then I have sudden aspirations\ntoward a calmer existence which might recall my childhood. One has\nalways had a childhood, whatever one becomes. Don't be alarmed; I am not\ngoing to tell you that I am the daughter of a colonel on half-pay, and\nthat I was brought up at Saint-Denis. I am a poor country girl, and six\nyears ago I could not write my own name. You are relieved, aren't you?\nWhy is it you are the first whom I have ever asked to share the joy\nof this desire of mine? I suppose because I feel that you love me for\nmyself and not for yourself, while all the others have only loved me for\nthemselves.\n\n\"I have often been in the country, but never as I should like to go\nthere. I count on you for this easy happiness; do not be unkind, let\nme have it. Say this to yourself: 'She will never live to be old, and I\nshould some day be sorry for not having done for her the first thing she\nasked of me, such an easy thing to do!'\"\n\nWhat could I reply to such words, especially with the memory of a first\nnight of love, and in the expectation of a second?\n\nAn hour later I held Marguerite in my arms, and, if she had asked me to\ncommit a crime, I would have obeyed her.\n\nAt six in the morning I left her, and before leaving her I said: \"Till\nto-night!\" She kissed me more warmly than ever, but said nothing.\n\nDuring the day I received a note containing these words:\n\n\"DEAR CHILD: I am not very well, and the doctor has ordered quiet. I\nshall go to bed early to-night and shall not see you. But, to make up, I\nshall expect you to-morrow at twelve. I love you.\"\n\nMy first thought was: She is deceiving me!\n\nA cold sweat broke out on my forehead, for I already loved this woman\ntoo much not to be overwhelmed by the suspicion. And yet, I was bound to\nexpect such a thing almost any day with Marguerite, and it had happened\nto me often enough with my other mistresses, without my taking much\nnotice of it. What was the meaning of the hold which this woman had\ntaken upon my life?\n\nThen it occurred to me, since I had the key, to go and see her as usual.\nIn this way I should soon know the truth, and if I found a man there I\nwould strike him in the face.\n\nMeanwhile I went to the Champs-Elysees. I waited there four hours. She\ndid not appear. At night I went into all the theatres where she was\naccustomed to go. She was in none of them.\n\nAt eleven o'clock I went to the Rue d'Antin. There was no light in\nMarguerite's windows. All the same, I rang. The porter asked me where I\nwas going.\n\n\"To Mlle. Gautier's,\" I said.\n\n\"She has not come in.\"\n\n\"I will go up and wait for her.\"\n\n\"There is no one there.\"\n\nEvidently I could get in, since I had the key, but, fearing foolish\nscandal, I went away. Only I did not return home; I could not leave the\nstreet, and I never took my eyes off Marguerite's house. It seemed to\nme that there was still something to be found out, or at least that my\nsuspicions were about to be confirmed.\n\nAbout midnight a carriage that I knew well stopped before No. 9. The\nComte de G. got down and entered the house, after sending away the\ncarriage. For a moment I hoped that the same answer would be given to\nhim as to me, and that I should see him come out; but at four o'clock in\nthe morning I was still awaiting him.\n\nI have suffered deeply during these last three weeks, but that is\nnothing, I think, in comparison with what I suffered that night.\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nWhen I reached home I began to cry like a child. There is no man to whom\na woman has not been unfaithful, once at least, and who will not know\nwhat I suffered.\n\nI said to myself, under the weight of these feverish resolutions which\none always feels as if one had the force to carry out, that I must break\nwith my amour at once, and I waited impatiently for daylight in order\nto set out forthwith to rejoin my father and my sister, of whose love at\nleast I was certain, and certain that that love would never be betrayed.\n\nHowever, I did not wish to go away without letting Marguerite know why\nI went. Only a man who really cares no more for his mistress leaves her\nwithout writing to her. I made and remade twenty letters in my head. I\nhad had to do with a woman like all other women of the kind. I had been\npoetizing too much. She had treated me like a school-boy, she had used\nin deceiving me a trick which was insultingly simple. My self-esteem\ngot the upper hand. I must leave this woman without giving her the\nsatisfaction of knowing that she had made me suffer, and this is what I\nwrote to her in my most elegant handwriting and with tears of rage and\nsorrow in my eyes:\n\n\"MY DEAR MARGUERITE: I hope that your indisposition yesterday was not\nserious. I came, at eleven at night, to ask after you, and was told\nthat you had not come in. M. de G. was more fortunate, for he presented\nhimself shortly afterward, and at four in the morning he had not left.\n\n\"Forgive me for the few tedious hours that I have given you, and be\nassured that I shall never forget the happy moments which I owe to you.\n\n\"I should have called to-day to ask after you, but I intend going back\nto my father's.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear Marguerite. I am not rich enough to love you as I\nwould nor poor enough to love you as you would. Let us then forget, you\na name which must be indifferent enough to you, I a happiness which has\nbecome impossible.\n\n\"I send back your key, which I have never used, and which might be\nuseful to you, if you are often ill as you were yesterday.\"\n\nAs you will see, I was unable to end my letter without a touch of\nimpertinent irony, which proved how much in love I still was.\n\nI read and reread this letter ten times over; then the thought of the\npain it would give to Marguerite calmed me a little. I tried to persuade\nmyself of the feelings which it professed; and when my servant came to\nmy room at eight o'clock, I gave it to him and told him to take it at\nonce.\n\n\"Shall I wait for an answer?\" asked Joseph (my servant, like all\nservants, was called Joseph).\n\n\"If they ask whether there is a reply, you will say that you don't know,\nand wait.\"\n\nI buoyed myself up with the hope that she would reply. Poor, feeble\ncreatures that we are! All the time that my servant was away I was in a\nstate of extreme agitation. At one moment I would recall how Marguerite\nhad given herself to me, and ask myself by what right I wrote her an\nimpertinent letter, when she could reply that it was not M. de G. who\nsupplanted me, but I who had supplanted M. de G.: a mode of reasoning\nwhich permits many women to have many lovers. At another moment I would\nrecall her promises, and endeavour to convince myself that my letter was\nonly too gentle, and that there were not expressions forcible enough to\npunish a woman who laughed at a love like mine. Then I said to myself\nthat I should have done better not to have written to her, but to have\ngone to see her, and that then I should have had the pleasure of seeing\nthe tears that she would shed. Finally, I asked myself what she would\nreply to me; already prepared to believe whatever excuse she made.\n\nJoseph returned.\n\n\"Well?\" I said to him.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"madame was not up, and still asleep, but as soon as she\nrings the letter will be taken to her, and if there is any reply it will\nbe sent.\"\n\nShe was asleep!\n\nTwenty times I was on the point of sending to get the letter back, but\nevery time I said to myself: \"Perhaps she will have got it already, and\nit would look as if I have repented of sending it.\"\n\nAs the hour at which it seemed likely that she would reply came nearer,\nI regretted more and more that I had written. The clock struck, ten,\neleven, twelve. At twelve I was on the point of keeping the appointment\nas if nothing had happened. In the end I could see no way out of the\ncircle of fire which closed upon me.\n\nThen I began to believe, with the superstition which people have when\nthey are waiting, that if I went out for a little while, I should find\nan answer when I got back. I went out under the pretext of going to\nlunch.\n\nInstead of lunching at the Cafe Foy, at the corner of the Boulevard, as\nI usually did, I preferred to go to the Palais Royal and so pass through\nthe Rue d'Antin. Every time that I saw a woman at a distance, I fancied\nit was Nanine bringing me an answer. I passed through the Rue d'Antin\nwithout even coming across a commissionaire. I went to Very's in the\nPalais Royal. The waiter gave me something to eat, or rather served up\nto me whatever he liked, for I ate nothing. In spite of myself, my eyes\nwere constantly fixed on the clock. I returned home, certain that I\nshould find a letter from Marguerite.\n\nThe porter had received nothing, but I still hoped in my servant. He had\nseen no one since I went out.\n\nIf Marguerite had been going to answer me she would have answered long\nbefore.\n\nThen I began to regret the terms of my letter; I should have said\nabsolutely nothing, and that would undoubtedly have aroused her\nsuspicions, for, finding that I did not keep my appointment, she would\nhave inquired the reason of my absence, and only then I should have\ngiven it to her. Thus, she would have had to exculpate herself, and what\nI wanted was for her to exculpate herself. I already realized that I\nshould have believed whatever reasons she had given me, and anything was\nbetter than not to see her again.\n\nAt last I began to believe that she would come to see me herself; but\nhour followed hour, and she did not come.\n\nDecidedly Marguerite was not like other women, for there are few\nwho would have received such a letter as I had just written without\nanswering it at all.\n\nAt five, I hastened to the Champs-Elysees. \"If I meet her,\" I thought,\n\"I will put on an indifferent air, and she will be convinced that I no\nlonger think about her.\"\n\nAs I turned the corner of the Rue Royale, I saw her pass in her\ncarriage. The meeting was so sudden that I turned pale. I do not know if\nshe saw my emotion; as for me, I was so agitated that I saw nothing but\nthe carriage.\n\nI did not go any farther in the direction of the Champs-Elysees. I\nlooked at the advertisements of the theatres, for I had still a chance\nof seeing her. There was a first night at the Palais Royal. Marguerite\nwas sure to be there. I was at the theatre by seven. The boxes filled\none after another, but Marguerite was not there. I left the Palais Royal\nand went to all the theatres where she was most often to be seen: to the\nVaudeville, the Varietes, the Opera Comique. She was nowhere.\n\nEither my letter had troubled her too much for her to care to go to\nthe theatre, or she feared to come across me, and so wished to avoid an\nexplanation. So my vanity was whispering to me on the boulevards, when I\nmet Gaston, who asked me where I had been.\n\n\"At the Palais Royal.\"\n\n\"And I at the Opera,\" said he; \"I expected to see you there.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Marguerite was there.\"\n\n\"Ah, she was there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"No; with another woman.\"\n\n\"That all?\"\n\n\"The Comte de G. came to her box for an instant; but she went off with\nthe duke. I expected to see you every moment, for there was a stall at\nmy side which remained empty the whole evening, and I was sure you had\ntaken it.\"\n\n\"But why should I go where Marguerite goes?\"\n\n\"Because you are her lover, surely!\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Prudence, whom I met yesterday. I give you my congratulations, my dear\nfellow; she is a charming mistress, and it isn't everybody who has the\nchance. Stick to her; she will do you credit.\"\n\nThese simple reflections of Gaston showed me how absurd had been my\nsusceptibilities. If I had only met him the night before and he had\nspoken to me like that, I should certainly not have written the foolish\nletter which I had written.\n\nI was on the point of calling on Prudence, and of sending her to tell\nMarguerite that I wanted to speak to her; but I feared that she would\nrevenge herself on me by saying that she could not see me, and I\nreturned home, after passing through the Rue d'Antin. Again I asked my\nporter if there was a letter for me. Nothing! She is waiting to see if I\nshall take some fresh step, and if I retract my letter of to-day, I said\nto myself as I went to bed; but, seeing that I do not write, she will\nwrite to me to-morrow.\n\nThat night, more than ever, I reproached myself for what I had done. I\nwas alone, unable to sleep, devoured by restlessness and jealousy, when\nby simply letting things take their natural course I should have been\nwith Marguerite, hearing the delicious words which I had heard only\ntwice, and which made my ears burn in my solitude.\n\nThe most frightful part of the situation was that my judgment was\nagainst me; as a matter of fact, everything went to prove that\nMarguerite loved me. First, her proposal to spend the summer with me in\nthe country, then the certainty that there was no reason why she should\nbe my mistress, since my income was insufficient for her needs and even\nfor her caprices. There could not then have been on her part anything\nbut the hope of finding in me a sincere affection, able to give her\nrest from the mercenary loves in whose midst she lived; and on the very\nsecond day I had destroyed this hope, and paid by impertinent irony for\nthe love which I had accepted during two nights. What I had done was\ntherefore not merely ridiculous, it was indelicate. I had not even\npaid the woman, that I might have some right to find fault with her;\nwithdrawing after two days, was I not like a parasite of love, afraid of\nhaving to pay the bill of the banquet? What! I had only known Marguerite\nfor thirty-six hours; I had been her lover for only twenty-four; and\ninstead of being too happy that she should grant me all that she did,\nI wanted to have her all to myself, and to make her sever at one stroke\nall her past relations which were the revenue of her future. What had I\nto reproach in her? Nothing. She had written to say she was unwell, when\nshe might have said to me quite crudely, with the hideous frankness of\ncertain women, that she had to see a lover; and, instead of believing\nher letter, instead of going to any street in Paris except the Rue\nd'Antin, instead of spending the evening with my friends, and presenting\nmyself next day at the appointed hour, I was acting the Othello, spying\nupon her, and thinking to punish her by seeing her no more. But, on the\ncontrary, she ought to be enchanted at this separation. She ought to\nfind me supremely foolish, and her silence was not even that of rancour;\nit was contempt.\n\nI might have made Marguerite a present which would leave no doubt as to\nmy generosity and permit me to feel properly quits of her, as of a\nkept woman, but I should have felt that I was offending by the least\nappearance of trafficking, if not the love which she had for me, at all\nevents the love which I had for her, and since this love was so pure\nthat it could admit no division, it could not pay by a present, however\ngenerous, the happiness that it had received, however short that\nhappiness had been.\n\nThat is what I said to myself all night long, and what I was every\nmoment prepared to go and say to Marguerite. When the day dawned I\nwas still sleepless. I was in a fever. I could think of nothing but\nMarguerite.\n\nAs you can imagine, it was time to take a decided step, and finish\neither with the woman or with one's scruples, if, that is, she would\nstill be willing to see me. But you know well, one is always slow in\ntaking a decided step; so, unable to remain within doors and not daring\nto call on Marguerite, I made one attempt in her direction, an attempt\nthat I could always look upon as a mere chance if it succeeded.\n\nIt was nine o'clock, and I went at once to call upon Prudence, who asked\nto what she owed this early visit. I dared not tell her frankly what\nbrought me. I replied that I had gone out early in order to reserve a\nplace in the diligence for C., where my father lived.\n\n\"You are fortunate,\" she said, \"in being able to get away from Paris in\nthis fine weather.\"\n\nI looked at Prudence, asking myself whether she was laughing at me, but\nher face was quite serious.\n\n\"Shall you go and say good-bye to Marguerite?\" she continued, as\nseriously as before.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are quite right.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Naturally. Since you have broken with her, why should you see her\nagain?\"\n\n\"You know it is broken off?\"\n\n\"She showed me your letter.\"\n\n\"What did she say about it?\"\n\n\"She said: 'My dear Prudence, your protege is not polite; one thinks\nsuch letters, one does not write them.\"'\n\n\"In what tone did she say that?\"\n\n\"Laughingly,\" and she added: \"He has had supper with me twice, and hasn't\neven called.\"\n\nThat, then, was the effect produced by my letter and my jealousy. I was\ncruelly humiliated in the vanity of my affection.\n\n\"What did she do last night?\"\n\n\"She went to the opera.\"\n\n\"I know. And afterward?\"\n\n\"She had supper at home.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"With the Comte de G., I believe.\"\n\nSo my breaking with her had not changed one of her habits. It is for\nsuch reasons as this that certain people say to you: Don't have anything\nmore to do with the woman; she cares nothing about you.\n\n\"Well, I am very glad to find that Marguerite does not put herself out\nfor me,\" I said with a forced smile.\n\n\"She has very good reason not to. You have done what you were bound to\ndo. You have been more reasonable than she, for she was really in love\nwith you; she did nothing but talk of you. I don't know what she would\nnot have been capable of doing.\"\n\n\"Why hasn't she answered me, if she was in love with me?\"\n\n\"Because she realizes she was mistaken in letting herself love you.\nWomen sometimes allow you to be unfaithful to their love; they never\nallow you to wound their self-esteem; and one always wounds the\nself-esteem of a woman when, two days after one has become her lover,\none leaves her, no matter for what reason. I know Marguerite; she would\ndie sooner than reply.\"\n\n\"What can I do, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing. She will forget you, you will forget her, and neither will\nhave any reproach to make against the other.\"\n\n\"But if I write and ask her forgiveness?\"\n\n\"Don't do that, for she would forgive you.\"\n\nI could have flung my arms round Prudence's neck.\n\nA quarter of an hour later I was once more in my own quarters, and I\nwrote to Marguerite:\n\n\"Some one, who repents of a letter that he wrote yesterday and who will\nleave Paris to-morrow if you do not forgive him, wishes to know at what\nhour he might lay his repentance at your feet.\n\n\"When can he find you alone? for, you know, confessions must be made\nwithout witnesses.\"\n\nI folded this kind of madrigal in prose, and sent it by Joseph, who\nhanded it to Marguerite herself; she replied that she would send the\nanswer later.\n\nI only went out to have a hasty dinner, and at eleven in the evening no\nreply had come. I made up my mind to endure it no longer, and to set out\nnext day. In consequence of this resolution, and convinced that I should\nnot sleep if I went to bed, I began to pack up my things.\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\nIt was hardly an hour after Joseph and I had begun preparing for my\ndeparture, when there was a violent ring at the door.\n\n\"Shall I go to the door?\" said Joseph.\n\n\"Go,\" I said, asking myself who it could be at such an hour, and not\ndaring to believe that it was Marguerite.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Joseph coming back to me, \"it is two ladies.\"\n\n\"It is we, Armand,\" cried a voice that I recognised as that of Prudence.\n\nI came out of my room. Prudence was standing looking around the place;\nMarguerite, seated on the sofa, was meditating. I went to her, knelt\ndown, took her two hands, and, deeply moved, said to her, \"Pardon.\"\n\nShe kissed me on the forehead, and said:\n\n\"This is the third time that I have forgiven you.\"\n\n\"I should have gone away to-morrow.\"\n\n\"How can my visit change your plans? I have not come to hinder you from\nleaving Paris. I have come because I had no time to answer you during\nthe day, and I did not wish to let you think that I was angry with you.\nPrudence didn't want me to come; she said that I might be in the way.\"\n\n\"You in the way, Marguerite! But how?\"\n\n\"Well, you might have had a woman here,\" said Prudence, \"and it would\nhardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive.\"\n\nDuring this remark Marguerite looked at me attentively.\n\n\"My dear Prudence,\" I answered, \"you do not know what you are saying.\"\n\n\"What a nice place you've got!\" Prudence went on. \"May we see the\nbedroom?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nPrudence went into the bedroom, not so much to see it as to make up for\nthe foolish thing which she had just said, and to leave Marguerite and\nme alone.\n\n\"Why did you bring Prudence?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Because she was at the theatre with me, and because when I leave here I\nwant to have someone to see me home.\"\n\n\"Could not I do?\"\n\n\"Yes, but, besides not wishing to put you out, I was sure that if you\ncame as far as my door you would want to come up, and as I could not let\nyou, I did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying 'No.'\"\n\n\"And why could you not let me come up?\"\n\n\"Because I am watched, and the least suspicion might do me the greatest\nharm.\"\n\n\"Is that really the only reason?\"\n\n\"If there were any other, I would tell you; for we are not to have any\nsecrets from one another now.\"\n\n\"Come, Marguerite, I am not going to take a roundabout way of saying\nwhat I really want to say. Honestly, do you care for me a little?\"\n\n\"A great deal.\"\n\n\"Then why did you deceive me?\"\n\n\"My friend, if I were the Duchess So and So, if I had two hundred\nthousand francs a year, and if I were your mistress and had another\nlover, you would have the right to ask me; but I am Mlle. Marguerite\nGautier, I am forty thousand francs in debt, I have not a penny of my\nown, and I spend a hundred thousand francs a year. Your question becomes\nunnecessary and my answer useless.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" I said, letting my head sink on her knees; \"but I love\nyou madly.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, you must either love me a little less or understand me\na little better. Your letter gave me a great deal of pain. If I had\nbeen free, first of all I would not have seen the count the day before\nyesterday, or, if I had, I should have come and asked your forgiveness\nas you ask me now, and in future I should have had no other lover but\nyou. I fancied for a moment that I might give myself that happiness for\nsix months; you would not have it; you insisted on knowing the means.\nWell, good heavens, the means were easy enough to guess! In employing\nthem I was making a greater sacrifice for you than you imagine. I might\nhave said to you, 'I want twenty thousand francs'; you were in love with\nme and you would have found them, at the risk of reproaching me for it\nlater on. I preferred to owe you nothing; you did not understand the\nscruple, for such it was. Those of us who are like me, when we have any\nheart at all, we give a meaning and a development to words and things\nunknown to other women; I repeat, then, that on the part of Marguerite\nGautier the means which she used to pay her debts without asking you for\nthe money necessary for it, was a scruple by which you ought to profit,\nwithout saying anything. If you had only met me to-day, you would be too\ndelighted with what I promised you, and you would not question me as to\nwhat I did the day before yesterday. We are sometimes obliged to buy the\nsatisfaction of our souls at the expense of our bodies, and we suffer\nstill more, when, afterward, that satisfaction is denied us.\"\n\nI listened, and I gazed at Marguerite with admiration. When I thought\nthat this marvellous creature, whose feet I had once longed to kiss, was\nwilling to let me take my place in her thoughts, my part in her life,\nand that I was not yet content with what she gave me, I asked if man's\ndesire has indeed limits when, satisfied as promptly as mine had been,\nit reached after something further.\n\n\"Truly,\" she continued, \"we poor creatures of chance have fantastic\ndesires and inconceivable loves. We give ourselves now for one thing,\nnow for another. There are men who ruin themselves without obtaining\nthe least thing from us; there are others who obtain us for a bouquet of\nflowers. Our hearts have their caprices; it is their one distraction\nand their one excuse. I gave myself to you sooner than I ever did to\nany man, I swear to you; and do you know why? Because when you saw me\nspitting blood you took my hand; because you wept; because you are the\nonly human being who has ever pitied me. I am going to say a mad thing\nto you: I once had a little dog who looked at me with a sad look when\nI coughed; that is the only creature I ever loved. When he died I cried\nmore than when my mother died. It is true that for twelve years of her\nlife she used to beat me. Well, I loved you all at once, as much as my\ndog. If men knew what they can have for a tear, they would be better\nloved and we should be less ruinous to them.\n\n\"Your letter undeceived me; it showed me that you lacked the\nintelligence of the heart; it did you more harm with me than anything\nyou could possibly have done. It was jealousy certainly, but ironical\nand impertinent jealousy. I was already feeling sad when I received your\nletter. I was looking forward to seeing you at twelve, to having lunch\nwith you, and wiping out, by seeing you, a thought which was with\nme incessantly, and which, before I knew you, I had no difficulty in\ntolerating.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Marguerite, \"you were the only person before whom it\nseemed to me, from the first, that I could think and speak freely. All\nthose who come about women like me have an interest in calculating\ntheir slightest words, in thinking of the consequences of their most\ninsignificant actions. Naturally we have no friends. We have selfish\nlovers who spend their fortunes, riot on us, as they say, but on their\nown vanity. For these people we have to be merry when they are merry,\nwell when they want to sup, sceptics like themselves. We are not allowed\nto have hearts, under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our\ncredit.\n\n\"We no longer belong to ourselves. We are no longer beings, but things.\nWe stand first in their self-esteem, last in their esteem. We have women\nwho call themselves our friends, but they are friends like Prudence,\nwomen who were once kept and who have still the costly tastes that their\nage does not allow them to gratify. Then they become our friends, or\nrather our guests at table. Their friendship is carried to the point of\nservility, never to that of disinterestedness. Never do they give you\nadvice which is not lucrative. It means little enough to them that we\nshould have ten lovers extra, as long as they get dresses or a bracelet\nout of them, and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time\nor come to our box at the theatre. They have our last night's bouquets,\nand they borrow our shawls. They never render us a service, however\nslight, without seeing that they are paid twice its value. You yourself\nsaw when Prudence brought me the six thousand francs that I had asked\nher to get from the duke, how she borrowed five hundred francs, which\nshe will never pay me back, or which she will pay me in hats, which will\nnever be taken out of their boxes.\n\n\"We can not, then, have, or rather I can not have more than one possible\nkind of happiness, and this is, sad as I sometimes am, suffering as I\nalways am, to find a man superior enough not to ask questions about my\nlife, and to be the lover of my impressions rather than of my body.\nSuch a man I found in the duke; but the duke is old, and old age neither\nprotects nor consoles. I thought I could accept the life which he\noffered me; but what would you have? I was dying of ennui, and if one is\nbound to be consumed, it is as well to throw oneself into the flames as\nto be asphyxiated with charcoal.\n\n\"Then I met you, young, ardent, happy, and I tried to make you the man I\nhad longed for in my noisy solitude. What I loved in you was not the\nman who was, but the man who was going to be. You do not accept the\nposition, you reject it as unworthy of you; you are an ordinary lover.\nDo like the others; pay me, and say no more about it.\"\n\nMarguerite, tired out with this long confession, threw herself back on\nthe sofa, and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her\nlips, and from that to her eyes.\n\n\"Pardon, pardon,\" I murmured. \"I understood it all, but I wanted to\nhave it from your own lips, my beloved Marguerite. Forget the rest and\nremember only one thing: that we belong to one another, that we are\nyoung, and that we love. Marguerite, do with me as you will; I am your\nslave, your dog, but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which I\nwrote to you and do not make me leave you to-morrow; it would kill me.\"\n\nMarguerite drew the letter from her bosom, and handing it to me with a\nsmile of infinite sweetness, said:\n\n\"Here it is. I have brought it back.\"\n\nI tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that\ngave it to me.\n\nAt this moment Prudence reappeared.\n\n\"Look here, Prudence; do you know what he wants?\" said Marguerite.\n\n\"He wants you to forgive him.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And you do?\"\n\n\"One has to; but he wants more than that.\"\n\n\"What, then?\"\n\n\"He wants to have supper with us.\"\n\n\"And do you consent?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"I think that you are two children who haven't an atom of sense between\nyou; but I also think that I am very hungry, and that the sooner you\nconsent the sooner we shall have supper.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Marguerite, \"there is room for the three of us in my\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" she added, turning to me, \"Nanine will be gone to bed. You\nmust open the door; take my key, and try not to lose it again.\"\n\nI embraced Marguerite until she was almost stifled.\n\nThereupon Joseph entered.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, with the air of a man who is very well satisfied with\nhimself, \"the luggage is packed.\"\n\n\"All of it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, then, unpack it again; I am not going.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\nI might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines,\nbut I wanted you to see every step by which we came, I to agree to\nwhatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite to be unable to live apart from\nme.\n\nIt was the day after the evening when she came to see me that I sent her\nManon Lescaut.\n\nFrom that time, seeing that I could not change my mistress's life, I\nchanged my own. I wished above all not to leave myself time to think\nover the position I had accepted, for, in spite of myself, it was a\ngreat distress to me. Thus my life, generally so calm, assumed all\nat once an appearance of noise and disorder. Never believe, however\ndisinterested the love of a kept woman may be, that it will cost one\nnothing. Nothing is so expensive as their caprices, flowers, boxes at\nthe theatre, suppers, days in the country, which one can never refuse to\none's mistress.\n\nAs I have told you, I had little money. My father was, and still is,\nreceveur general at C. He has a great reputation there for loyalty,\nthanks to which he was able to find the security which he needed in\norder to attain this position.\n\nIt is worth forty thousand francs a year, and during the ten years that\nhe has had it, he has paid off the security and put aside a dowry for\nmy sister. My father is the most honourable man in the world. When\nmy mother died, she left six thousand francs a year, which he divided\nbetween my sister and myself on the very day when he received his\nappointment; then, when I was twenty-one, he added to this little income\nan annual allowance of five thousand francs, assuring me that with\neight thousand francs a year I might live very happily at Paris, if, in\naddition to this, I would make a position for myself either in law or\nmedicine. I came to Paris, studied law, was called to the bar, and, like\nmany other young men, put my diploma in my pocket, and let myself drift,\nas one so easily does in Paris.\n\nMy expenses were very moderate; only I used up my year's income in\neight months, and spent the four summer months with my father, which\npractically gave me twelve thousand francs a year, and, in addition, the\nreputation of a good son. For the rest, not a penny of debt.\n\nThis, then, was my position when I made the acquaintance of Marguerite.\nYou can well understand that, in spite of myself, my expenses soon\nincreased. Marguerite's nature was very capricious, and, like so many\nwomen, she never regarded as a serious expense those thousand and one\ndistractions which made up her life. So, wishing to spend as much time\nwith me as possible, she would write to me in the morning that she would\ndine with me, not at home, but at some restaurant in Paris or in the\ncountry. I would call for her, and we would dine and go on to the\ntheatre, often having supper as well; and by the end of the evening I\nhad spent four or five louis, which came to two or three thousand francs\na month, which reduced my year to three months and a half, and made it\nnecessary for me either to go into debt or to leave Marguerite. I would\nhave consented to anything except the latter.\n\nForgive me if I give you all these details, but you will see that they\nwere the cause of what was to follow. What I tell you is a true and\nsimple story, and I leave to it all the naivete of its details and all\nthe simplicity of its developments.\n\nI realized then that as nothing in the world would make me forget my\nmistress, it was needful for me to find some way of meeting the expenses\ninto which she drew me. Then, too, my love for her had so disturbing\nan influence upon me that every moment I spent away from Marguerite was\nlike a year, and that I felt the need of consuming these moments in the\nfire of some sort of passion, and of living them so swiftly as not to\nknow that I was living them.\n\nI began by borrowing five or six thousand francs on my little capital,\nand with this I took to gambling. Since gambling houses were destroyed\ngambling goes on everywhere. Formerly, when one went to Frascati, one\nhad the chance of making a fortune; one played against money, and if\none lost, there was always the consolation of saying that one might have\ngained; whereas now, except in the clubs, where there is still a certain\nrigour in regard to payments, one is almost certain, the moment one\ngains a considerable sum, not to receive it. You will readily understand\nwhy. Gambling is only likely to be carried on by young people very much\nin need of money and not possessing the fortune necessary for supporting\nthe life they lead; they gamble, then, and with this result; or else\nthey gain, and then those who lose serve to pay for their horses\nand mistresses, which is very disagreeable. Debts are contracted,\nacquaintances begun about a green table end by quarrels in which life\nor honour comes to grief; and though one may be an honest man, one finds\noneself ruined by very honest men, whose only defect is that they have\nnot two hundred thousand francs a year.\n\nI need not tell you of those who cheat at play, and of how one hears one\nfine day of their hasty disappearance and tardy condemnation.\n\nI flung myself into this rapid, noisy, and volcanic life, which had\nformerly terrified me when I thought of it, and which had become for\nme the necessary complement of my love for Marguerite. What else could I\nhave done?\n\nThe nights that I did not spend in the Rue d'Antin, if I had spent them\nalone in my own room, I could not have slept. Jealousy would have kept\nme awake, and inflamed my blood and my thoughts; while gambling gave a\nnew turn to the fever which would otherwise have preyed upon my heart,\nand fixed it upon a passion which laid hold on me in spite of myself,\nuntil the hour struck when I might go to my mistress. Then, and by this\nI knew the violence of my love, I left the table without a moment's\nhesitation, whether I was winning or losing, pitying those whom I left\nbehind because they would not, like me, find their real happiness in\nleaving it. For the most of them, gambling was a necessity; for me, it\nwas a remedy. Free of Marguerite, I should have been free of gambling.\n\nThus, in the midst of all that, I preserved a considerable amount of\nself-possession; I lost only what I was able to pay, and gained only\nwhat I should have been able to lose.\n\nFor the rest, chance was on my side. I made no debts, and I spent three\ntimes as much money as when I did not gamble. It was impossible to\nresist an existence which gave me an easy means of satisfying the\nthousand caprices of Marguerite. As for her, she continued to love me as\nmuch, or even more than ever.\n\nAs I told you, I began by being allowed to stay only from midnight to\nsix o'clock, then I was asked sometimes to a box in the theatre, then\nshe sometimes came to dine with me. One morning I did not go till eight,\nand there came a day when I did not go till twelve.\n\nBut, sooner than the moral metamorphosis, a physical metamorphosis came\nabout in Marguerite. I had taken her cure in hand, and the poor\ngirl, seeing my aim, obeyed me in order to prove her gratitude. I had\nsucceeded without effort or trouble in almost isolating her from her\nformer habits. My doctor, whom I had made her meet, had told me that\nonly rest and calm could preserve her health, so that in place of supper\nand sleepless nights, I succeeded in substituting a hygienic regime and\nregular sleep. In spite of herself, Marguerite got accustomed to this\nnew existence, whose salutary effects she already realized. She began\nto spend some of her evenings at home, or, if the weather was fine, she\nwrapped herself in a shawl, put on a veil, and we went on foot, like\ntwo children, in the dim alleys of the Champs-Elysees. She would come\nin tired, take a light supper, and go to bed after a little music or\nreading, which she had never been used to do. The cough, which\nevery time that I heard it seemed to go through my chest, had almost\ncompletely disappeared.\n\nAt the end of six weeks the count was entirely given up, and only the\nduke obliged me to conceal my liaison with Marguerite, and even he was\nsent away when I was there, under the pretext that she was asleep and\nhad given orders that she was not to be awakened.\n\nThe habit or the need of seeing me which Marguerite had now contracted\nhad this good result: that it forced me to leave the gaming-table just\nat the moment when an adroit gambler would have left it. Settling one\nthing against another, I found myself in possession of some ten thousand\nfrancs, which seemed to me an inexhaustible capital.\n\nThe time of the year when I was accustomed to join my father and sister\nhad now arrived, and I did not go; both of them wrote to me frequently,\nbegging me to come. To these letters I replied as best I could, always\nrepeating that I was quite well and that I was not in need of money, two\nthings which, I thought, would console my father for my delay in paying\nhim my annual visit.\n\nJust then, one fine day in summer, Marguerite was awakened by the\nsunlight pouring into her room, and, jumping out of bed, asked me if I\nwould take her into the country for the whole day.\n\nWe sent for Prudence, and all three set off, after Marguerite had given\nNanine orders to tell the duke that she had taken advantage of the fine\nday to go into the country with Mme. Duvernoy.\n\nBesides the presence of Mme. Duvernoy being needful on account of the\nold duke, Prudence was one of those women who seem made on purpose for\ndays in the country. With her unchanging good-humour and her eternal\nappetite, she never left a dull moment to those whom she was with, and\nwas perfectly happy in ordering eggs, cherries, milk, stewed rabbit, and\nall the rest of the traditional lunch in the country.\n\nWe had now only to decide where we should go. It was once more Prudence\nwho settled the difficulty.\n\n\"Do you want to go to the real country?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go to Bougival, at the Point du Jour, at Widow Arnould's.\nArmand, order an open carriage.\"\n\nAn hour and a half later we were at Widow Arnould's.\n\nPerhaps you know the inn, which is a hotel on week days and a tea garden\non Sundays. There is a magnificent view from the garden, which is at\nthe height of an ordinary first floor. On the left the Aqueduct of Marly\ncloses in the horizon, on the right one looks across bill after hill;\nthe river, almost without current at that spot, unrolls itself like a\nlarge white watered ribbon between the plain of the Gabillons and the\nisland of Croissy, lulled eternally by the trembling of its high poplars\nand the murmur of its willows. Beyond, distinct in the sunlight, rise\nlittle white houses, with red roofs, and manufactories, which, at that\ndistance, put an admirable finish to the landscape. Beyond that, Paris\nin the mist! As Prudence had told us, it was the real country, and, I\nmust add, it was a real lunch.\n\nIt is not only out of gratitude for the happiness I owe it, but\nBougival, in spite of its horrible name, is one of the prettiest places\nthat it is possible to imagine. I have travelled a good deal, and seen\nmuch grander things, but none more charming than this little village\ngaily seated at the foot of the hill which protects it.\n\nMme. Arnould asked us if we would take a boat, and Marguerite and\nPrudence accepted joyously.\n\nPeople have always associated the country with love, and they have done\nwell; nothing affords so fine a frame for the woman whom one loves as\nthe blue sky, the odours, the flowers, the breeze, the shining solitude\nof fields, or woods. However much one loves a woman, whatever confidence\none may have in her, whatever certainty her past may offer us as to her\nfuture, one is always more or less jealous. If you have been in love,\nyou must have felt the need of isolating from this world the being in\nwhom you would live wholly. It seems as if, however indifferent she may\nbe to her surroundings, the woman whom one loves loses something of her\nperfume and of her unity at the contact of men and things. As for me, I\nexperienced that more than most. Mine was not an ordinary love; I was\nas much in love as an ordinary creature could be, but with Marguerite\nGautier; that is to say, that at Paris, at every step, I might elbow\nthe man who had already been her lover or who was about to, while in\nthe country, surrounded by people whom we had never seen and who had no\nconcern with us, alone with nature in the spring-time of the year, that\nannual pardon, and shut off from the noise of the city, I could hide my\nlove, and love without shame or fear.\n\nThe courtesan disappeared little by little. I had by me a young and\nbeautiful woman, whom I loved, and who loved me, and who was called\nMarguerite; the past had no more reality and the future no more clouds.\nThe sun shone upon my mistress as it might have shone upon the purest\nbride. We walked together in those charming spots which seemed to have\nbeen made on purpose to recall the verses of Lamartine or to sing the\nmelodies of Scudo. Marguerite was dressed in white, she leaned on my\narm, saying over to me again under the starry sky the words she had said\nto me the day before, and far off the world went on its way, without\ndarkening with its shadow the radiant picture of our youth and love.\n\nThat was the dream that the hot sun brought to me that day through the\nleaves of the trees, as, lying on the grass of the island on which we\nhad landed, I let my thought wander, free from the human links that had\nbound it, gathering to itself every hope that came in its way.\n\nAdd to this that from the place where I was I could see on the shore\na charming little house of two stories, with a semicircular railing;\nthrough the railing, in front of the house, a green lawn, smooth as\nvelvet, and behind the house a little wood full of mysterious retreats,\nwhere the moss must efface each morning the pathway that had been\nmade the day before. Climbing flowers clung about the doorway of this\nuninhabited house, mounting as high as the first story.\n\nI looked at the house so long that I began by thinking of it as mine, so\nperfectly did it embody the dream that I was dreaming; I saw Marguerite\nand myself there, by day in the little wood that covered the hillside,\nin the evening seated on the grass, and I asked myself if earthly\ncreatures had ever been so happy as we should be.\n\n\"What a pretty house!\" Marguerite said to me, as she followed the\ndirection of my gaze and perhaps of my thought.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Prudence.\n\n\"Yonder,\" and Marguerite pointed to the house in question.\n\n\"Ah, delicious!\" replied Prudence. \"Do you like it?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"Well, tell the duke to take it for you; he would do so, I am sure. I'll\nsee about it if you like.\"\n\nMarguerite looked at me, as if to ask me what I thought. My dream\nvanished at the last words of Prudence, and brought me back to reality\nso brutally that I was still stunned with the fall.\n\n\"Yes, yes, an excellent idea,\" I stammered, not knowing what I was\nsaying.\n\n\"Well, I will arrange that,\" said Marguerite, freeing my hand, and\ninterpreting my words according to her own desire. \"Let us go and see if\nit is to let.\"\n\nThe house was empty, and to let for two thousand francs.\n\n\"Would you be happy here?\" she said to me.\n\n\"Am I sure of coming here?\"\n\n\"And for whom else should I bury myself here, if not for you?\"\n\n\"Well, then, Marguerite, let me take it myself.\"\n\n\"You are mad; not only is it unnecessary, but it would be dangerous. You\nknow perfectly well that I have no right to accept it save from one man.\nLet me alone, big baby, and say nothing.\"\n\n\"That means,\" said Prudence, \"that when I have two days free I will come\nand spend them with you.\"\n\nWe left the house, and started on our return to Paris, talking over\nthe new plan. I held Marguerite in my arms, and as I got down from the\ncarriage, I had already begun to look upon her arrangement with less\ncritical eyes.\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\nNext day Marguerite sent me away very early, saying that the duke was\ncoming at an early hour, and promising to write to me the moment he\nwent, and to make an appointment for the evening. In the course of the\nday I received this note:\n\n\"I am going to Bougival with the duke; be at Prudence's to-night at\neight.\"\n\nAt the appointed hour Marguerite came to me at Mme. Duvernoy's. \"Well,\nit is all settled,\" she said, as she entered. \"The house is taken?\"\nasked Prudence. \"Yes; he agreed at once.\"\n\nI did not know the duke, but I felt ashamed of deceiving him.\n\n\"But that is not all,\" continued Marguerite.\n\n\"What else is there?\"\n\n\"I have been seeing about a place for Armand to stay.\"\n\n\"In the same house?\" asked Prudence, laughing.\n\n\"No, at Point du Jour, where we had dinner, the duke and I. While he\nwas admiring the view, I asked Mme. Arnould (she is called Mme. Arnould,\nisn't she?) if there were any suitable rooms, and she showed me just the\nvery thing: salon, anteroom, and bed-room, at sixty francs a month; the\nwhole place furnished in a way to divert a hypochondriac. I took it. Was\nI right?\" I flung my arms around her neck and kissed her.\n\n\"It will be charming,\" she continued. \"You have the key of the little\ndoor, and I have promised the duke the key of the front door, which\nhe will not take, because he will come during the day when he comes. I\nthink, between ourselves, that he is enchanted with a caprice which will\nkeep me out of Paris for a time, and so silence the objections of his\nfamily. However, he has asked me how I, loving Paris as I do, could make\nup my mind to bury myself in the country. I told him that I was ill, and\nthat I wanted rest. He seemed to have some difficulty in believing me.\nThe poor old man is always on the watch. We must take every precaution,\nmy dear Armand, for he will have me watched while I am there; and it\nisn't only the question of his taking a house for me, but he has my\ndebts to pay, and unluckily I have plenty. Does all that suit you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered, trying to quiet the scruples which this way of living\nawoke in me from time to time.\n\n\"We went all over the house, and we shall have everything perfect. The\nduke is going to look after every single thing. Ah, my dear,\" she added,\nkissing me, \"you're in luck; it's a millionaire who makes your bed for\nyou.\"\n\n\"And when shall you move into the house?\" inquired Prudence.\n\n\"As soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Will you take your horses and carriage?\"\n\n\"I shall take the whole house, and you can look after my place while I\nam away.\"\n\nA week later Marguerite was settled in her country house, and I was\ninstalled at Point du Jour.\n\nThen began an existence which I shall have some difficulty in describing\nto you. At first Marguerite could not break entirely with her former\nhabits, and, as the house was always en fete, all the women whom\nshe knew came to see her. For a whole month there was not a day when\nMarguerite had not eight or ten people to meals. Prudence, on her side,\nbrought down all the people she knew, and did the honours of the house\nas if the house belonged to her.\n\nThe duke's money paid for all that, as you may imagine; but from time\nto time Prudence came to me, asking for a note for a thousand francs,\nprofessedly on behalf of Marguerite. You know I had won some money at\ngambling; I therefore immediately handed over to Prudence what she\nasked for Marguerite, and fearing lest she should require more than I\npossessed, I borrowed at Paris a sum equal to that which I had already\nborrowed and paid back. I was then once more in possession of some ten\nthousand francs, without reckoning my allowance. However, Marguerite's\npleasure in seeing her friends was a little moderated when she saw the\nexpense which that pleasure entailed, and especially the necessity she\nwas sometimes in of asking me for money. The duke, who had taken the\nhouse in order that Marguerite might rest there, no longer visited it,\nfearing to find himself in the midst of a large and merry company, by\nwhom he did not wish to be seen. This came about through his having once\narrived to dine tete-a-tete with Marguerite, and having fallen upon\na party of fifteen, who were still at lunch at an hour when he was\nprepared to sit down to dinner. He had unsuspectingly opened the\ndining-room door, and had been greeted by a burst of laughter, and had\nhad to retire precipitately before the impertinent mirth of the women\nwho were assembled there.\n\nMarguerite rose from table, and joined the duke in the next room, where\nshe tried, as far as possible, to induce him to forget the incident, but\nthe old man, wounded in his dignity, bore her a grudge for it, and could\nnot forgive her. He said to her, somewhat cruelly, that he was tired of\npaying for the follies of a woman who could not even have him treated\nwith respect under his own roof, and he went away in great indignation.\n\nSince that day he had never been heard of.\n\nIn vain Marguerite dismissed her guests, changed her way of life;\nthe duke was not to be heard of. I was the gainer in so, far that my\nmistress now belonged to me more completely, and my dream was at length\nrealized. Marguerite could not be without me. Not caring what the result\nmight be, she publicly proclaimed our liaison, and I had come to live\nentirely at her house. The servants addressed me officially as their\nmaster.\n\nPrudence had strictly sermonized Marguerite in regard to her new manner\nof life; but she had replied that she loved me, that she could not live\nwithout me, and that, happen what might, she would not sacrifice the\npleasure of having me constantly with her, adding that those who were\nnot satisfied with this arrangement were free to stay away. So much\nI had heard one day when Prudence had said to Marguerite that she had\nsomething very important to tell her, and I had listened at the door of\nthe room into which they had shut themselves.\n\nNot long after, Prudence returned again. I was at the other end of the\ngarden when she arrived, and she did not see me. I had no doubt, from\nthe way in which Marguerite came to meet her, that another similar\nconversation was going to take place, and I was anxious to hear what\nit was about. The two women shut themselves into a boudoir, and I put\nmyself within hearing.\n\n\"Well?\" said Marguerite.\n\n\"Well, I have seen the duke.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"That he would gladly forgive you in regard to the scene which took\nplace, but that he has learned that you are publicly living with M.\nArmand Duval, and that he will never forgive that. 'Let Marguerite leave\nthe young man,' he said to me, 'and, as in the past, I will give her all\nthat she requires; if not, let her ask nothing more from me.'\"\n\n\"And you replied?\"\n\n\"That I would report his decision to you, and I promised him that I\nwould bring you into a more reasonable frame of mind. Only think, my\ndear child, of the position that you are losing, and that Armand can\nnever give you. He loves you with all his soul, but he has no fortune\ncapable of supplying your needs, and he will be bound to leave you one\nday, when it will be too late and when the duke will refuse to do any\nmore for you. Would you like me to speak to Armand?\"\n\nMarguerite seemed to be thinking, for she answered nothing. My heart\nbeat violently while I waited for her reply.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I will not leave Armand, and I will not conceal the\nfact that I am living with him. It is folly no doubt, but I love him.\nWhat would you have me do? And then, now that he has got accustomed to\nbe always with me, he would suffer too cruelly if he had to leave me so\nmuch as an hour a day. Besides, I have not such a long time to live that\nI need make myself miserable in order to please an old man whose very\nsight makes me feel old. Let him keep his money; I will do without it.\"\n\n\"But what will you do?\"\n\n\"I don't in the least know.\"\n\nPrudence was no doubt going to make some reply, but I entered suddenly\nand flung myself at Marguerite's feet, covering her hands with tears in\nmy joy at being thus loved.\n\n\"My life is yours, Marguerite; you need this man no longer. Am I not\nhere? Shall I ever leave you, and can I ever repay you for the happiness\nthat you give me? No more barriers, my Marguerite; we love; what matters\nall the rest?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I love you, my Armand,\" she murmured, putting her two arms\naround my neck. \"I love you as I never thought I should ever love. We\nwill be happy; we will live quietly, and I will say good-bye forever to\nthe life for which I now blush. You won't ever reproach me for the past?\nTell me!\"\n\nTears choked my voice. I could only reply by clasping Marguerite to my\nheart.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, turning to Prudence, and speaking in a broken voice,\n\"you can report this scene to the duke, and you can add that we have no\nlonger need of him.\"\n\nFrom that day forth the duke was never referred to. Marguerite was no\nlonger the same woman that I had known. She avoided everything that\nmight recall to me the life which she had been leading when I first\nmet her. Never did wife or sister surround husband or brother with\nsuch loving care as she had for me. Her nature was morbidly open to all\nimpressions and accessible to all sentiments. She had broken equally\nwith her friends and with her ways, with her words and with her\nextravagances. Any one who had seen us leaving the house to go on the\nriver in the charming little boat which I had bought would never have\nbelieved that the woman dressed in white, wearing a straw hat, and\ncarrying on her arm a little silk pelisse to protect her against the\ndamp of the river, was that Marguerite Gautier who, only four months\nago, had been the talk of the town for the luxury and scandal of her\nexistence.\n\nAlas, we made haste to be happy, as if we knew that we were not to be\nhappy long.\n\nFor two months we had not even been to Paris. No one came to see us,\nexcept Prudence and Julie Duprat, of whom I have spoken to you, and to\nwhom Marguerite was afterward to give the touching narrative that I have\nthere.\n\nI passed whole days at the feet of my mistress. We opened the windows\nupon the garden, and, as we watched the summer ripening in its flowers\nand under the shadow of the trees, we breathed together that true life\nwhich neither Marguerite nor I had ever known before.\n\nHer delight in the smallest things was like that of a child. There were\ndays when she ran in the garden, like a child of ten, after a butterfly\nor a dragon-fly. This courtesan who had cost more money in bouquets than\nwould have kept a whole family in comfort, would sometimes sit on the\ngrass for an hour, examining the simple flower whose name she bore.\n\nIt was at this time that she read Manon Lescaut, over and over again.\nI found her several times making notes in the book, and she always\ndeclared that when a woman loves, she can not do as Manon did.\n\nThe duke wrote to her two or three times. She recognised the writing and\ngave me the letters without reading them. Sometimes the terms of these\nletters brought tears to my eyes. He had imagined that by closing his\npurse to Marguerite, he would bring her back to him; but when he had\nperceived the uselessness of these means, he could hold out no longer;\nhe wrote and asked that he might see her again, as before, no matter on\nwhat conditions.\n\nI read these urgent and repeated letters, and tore them in pieces,\nwithout telling Marguerite what they contained and without advising her\nto see the old man again, though I was half inclined to, so much did I\npity him, but I was afraid lest, if I so advised her she should think\nthat I wished the duke, not merely to come and see her again, but to\ntake over the expenses of the house; I feared, above all, that she might\nthink me capable of shirking the responsibilities of every consequence\nto which her love for me might lead her.\n\nIt thus came about that the duke, receiving no reply, ceased to write,\nand that Marguerite and I continued to live together without giving a\nthought to the future.\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\nIt would be difficult to give you all the details of our new life. It\nwas made up of a series of little childish events, charming for us but\ninsignificant to anyone else. You know what it is to be in love with\na woman, you know how it cuts short the days, and with what loving\nlistlessness one drifts into the morrow. You know that forgetfulness of\neverything which comes of a violent confident, reciprocated love. Every\nbeing who is not the beloved one seems a useless being in creation. One\nregrets having cast scraps of one's heart to other women, and one can\nnot believe in the possibility of ever pressing another hand than that\nwhich one holds between one's hands. The mind admits neither work nor\nremembrance; nothing, in short, which can distract it from the one\nthought in which it is ceaselessly absorbed. Every day one discovers in\none's mistress a new charm and unknown delights. Existence itself is but\nthe unceasing accomplishment of an unchanging desire; the soul is but\nthe vestal charged to feed the sacred fire of love.\n\nWe often went at night-time to sit in the little wood above the house;\nthere we listened to the cheerful harmonies of evening, both of us\nthinking of the coming hours which should leave us to one another till\nthe dawn of day. At other times we did not get up all day; we did not\neven let the sunlight enter our room.\n\nThe curtains were hermetically closed, and for a moment the external\nworld did not exist for us. Nanine alone had the right to open our door,\nbut only to bring in our meals and even these we took without getting\nup, interrupting them with laughter and gaiety. To that succeeded a\nbrief sleep, for, disappearing into the depths of our love, we were like\ntwo divers who only come to the surface to take breath.\n\nNevertheless, I surprised moments of sadness, even tears, in Marguerite;\nI asked her the cause of her trouble, and she answered:\n\n\"Our love is not like other loves, my Armand. You love me as if I had\nnever belonged to another, and I tremble lest later on, repenting of\nyour love, and accusing me of my past, you should let me fall back into\nthat life from which you have taken me. I think that now that I have\ntasted of another life, I should die if I went back to the old one. Tell\nme that you will never leave me!\"\n\n\"I swear it!\"\n\nAt these words she looked at me as if to read in my eyes whether my oath\nwas sincere; then flung herself into my arms, and, hiding her head in my\nbosom, said to me: \"You don't know how much I love you!\"\n\nOne evening, seated on the balcony outside the window, we looked at the\nmoon which seemed to rise with difficulty out of its bed of clouds,\nand we listened to the wind violently rustling the trees; we held each\nother's hands, and for a whole quarter of an hour we had not spoken,\nwhen Marguerite said to me:\n\n\"Winter is at hand. Would you like for us to go abroad?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To Italy.\"\n\n\"You are tired of here?\"\n\n\"I am afraid of the winter; I am particularly afraid of your return to\nParis.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"For many reasons.\"\n\nAnd she went on abruptly, without giving me her reasons for fears:\n\n\"Will you go abroad? I will sell all that I have; we will go and live\nthere, and there will be nothing left of what I was; no one will know\nwho I am. Will you?\"\n\n\"By all means, if you like, Marguerite, let us travel,\" I said. \"But\nwhere is the necessity of selling things which you will be glad of when\nwe return? I have not a large enough fortune to accept such a sacrifice;\nbut I have enough for us to be able to travel splendidly for five or six\nmonths, if that will amuse you the least in the world.\"\n\n\"After all, no,\" she said, leaving the window and going to sit down\non the sofa at the other end of the room. \"Why should we spend money\nabroad? I cost you enough already, here.\"\n\n\"You reproach me, Marguerite; it isn't generous.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, my friend,\" she said, giving me her hand. \"This thunder\nweather gets on my nerves; I do not say what I intend to say.\"\n\nAnd after embracing me she fell into a long reverie.\n\nScenes of this kind often took place, and though I could not discover\ntheir cause, I could not fail to see in Marguerite signs of disquietude\nin regard to the future. She could not doubt my love, which increased\nday by day, and yet I often found her sad, without being able to get any\nexplanation of the reason, except some physical cause. Fearing that so\nmonotonous a life was beginning to weary her, I proposed returning to\nParis; but she always refused, assuring me that she could not be so\nhappy anywhere as in the country.\n\nPrudence now came but rarely; but she often wrote letters which I never\nasked to see, though, every time they came, they seemed to preoccupy\nMarguerite deeply. I did not know what to think.\n\nOne day Marguerite was in her room. I entered. She was writing. \"To whom\nare you writing?\" I asked. \"To Prudence. Do you want to see what I am\nwriting?\"\n\nI had a horror of anything that might look like suspicion, and I\nanswered that I had no desire to know what she was writing; and yet\nI was certain that letter would have explained to me the cause of her\nsadness.\n\nNext day the weather was splendid.' Marguerite proposed to me to\ntake the boat and go as far as the island of Croissy. She seemed very\ncheerful; when we got back it was five o'clock.\n\n\"Mme. Duvernoy has been here,\" said Nanine, as she saw us enter. \"She\nhas gone again?\" asked Marguerite.\n\n\"Yes, madame, in the carriage; she said it was arranged.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Marguerite sharply. \"Serve the dinner.\"\n\nTwo days afterward there came a letter from Prudence, and for a\nfortnight Marguerite seemed to have got rid of her mysterious gloom,\nfor which she constantly asked my forgiveness, now that it no longer\nexisted. Still, the carriage did not return.\n\n\"How is it that Prudence does not send you back your carriage?\" I asked\none day.\n\n\"One of the horses is ill, and there are some repairs to be done. It is\nbetter to have that done while we are here, and don't need a carriage,\nthan to wait till we get back to Paris.\"\n\nPrudence came two days afterward, and confirmed what Marguerite had\nsaid. The two women went for a walk in the garden, and when I joined\nthem they changed the conversation. That night, as she was going,\nPrudence complained of the cold and asked Marguerite to lend her a\nshawl.\n\nSo a month passed, and all the time Marguerite was more joyous and more\naffectionate than she ever had been. Nevertheless, the carriage did not\nreturn, the shawl had not been sent back, and I began to be anxious in\nspite of myself, and as I knew in which drawer Marguerite put Prudence's\nletters, I took advantage of a moment when she was at the other end of\nthe garden, went to the drawer, and tried to open it; in vain, for it\nwas locked. When I opened the drawer in which the trinkets and diamonds\nwere usually kept, these opened without resistance, but the jewel cases\nhad disappeared, along with their contents no doubt.\n\nA sharp fear penetrated my heart. I might indeed ask Marguerite for the\ntruth in regard to these disappearances, but it was certain that she\nwould not confess it.\n\n\"My good Marguerite,\" I said to her, \"I am going to ask your permission\nto go to Paris. They do not know my address, and I expect there are\nletters from my father waiting for me. I have no doubt he is concerned;\nI ought to answer him.\"\n\n\"Go, my friend,\" she said; \"but be back early.\" I went straight to\nPrudence.\n\n\"Come,\" said I, without beating about the bush, \"tell me frankly, where\nare Marguerite's horses?\"\n\n\"Sold.\"\n\n\"The shawl?\"\n\n\"Sold.\"\n\n\"The diamonds?\"\n\n\"Pawned.\"\n\n\"And who has sold and pawned them?\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me?\"\n\n\"Because Marguerite made me promise not to.\"\n\n\"And why did you not ask me for money?\"\n\n\"Because she wouldn't let me.\"\n\n\"And where has this money gone?\"\n\n\"In payments.\"\n\n\"Is she much in debt?\"\n\n\"Thirty thousand francs, or thereabouts. Ah, my dear fellow, didn't\nI tell you? You wouldn't believe me; now you are convinced. The\nupholsterer whom the duke had agreed to settle with was shown out of the\nhouse when he presented himself, and the duke wrote next day to say that\nhe would answer for nothing in regard to Mlle. Gautier. This man wanted\nhis money; he was given part payment out of the few thousand francs that\nI got from you; then some kind souls warned him that his debtor had been\nabandoned by the duke and was living with a penniless young man; the\nother creditors were told the same; they asked for their money, and\nseized some of the goods. Marguerite wanted to sell everything, but it\nwas too late, and besides I should have opposed it. But it was necessary\nto pay, and in order not to ask you for money, she sold her horses and\nher shawls, and pawned her jewels. Would you like to see the receipts\nand the pawn tickets?\"\n\nAnd Prudence opened the drawer and showed me the papers.\n\n\"Ah, you think,\" she continued, with the insistence of a woman who can\nsay, I was right after all, \"ah, you think it is enough to be in love,\nand to go into the country and lead a dreamy, pastoral life. No, my\nfriend, no. By the side of that ideal life, there is a material life,\nand the purest resolutions are held to earth by threads which seem\nslight enough, but which are of iron, not easily to be broken. If\nMarguerite has not been unfaithful to you twenty times, it is because\nshe has an exceptional nature. It is not my fault for not advising\nher to, for I couldn't bear to see the poor girl stripping herself\nof everything. She wouldn't; she replied that she loved you, and she\nwouldn't be unfaithful to you for anything in the world. All that is\nvery pretty, very poetical, but one can't pay one's creditors in that\ncoin, and now she can't free herself from debt, unless she can raise\nthirty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"All right, I will provide that amount.\"\n\n\"You will borrow it?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! Why, yes!\"\n\n\"A fine thing that will be to do; you will fall out with your father,\ncripple your resources, and one doesn't find thirty thousand francs from\none day to another. Believe me, my dear Armand, I know women better than\nyou do; do not commit this folly; you will be sorry for it one day. Be\nreasonable. I don't advise you to leave Marguerite, but live with her\nas you did at the beginning. Let her find the means to get out of this\ndifficulty. The duke will come back in a little while. The Comte de\nN., if she would take him, he told me yesterday even, would pay all her\ndebts, and give her four or five thousand francs a month. He has two\nhundred thousand a year. It would be a position for her, while you\nwill certainly be obliged to leave her. Don't wait till you are ruined,\nespecially as the Comte de N. is a fool, and nothing would prevent your\nstill being Marguerite's lover. She would cry a little at the beginning,\nbut she would come to accustom herself to it, and you would thank me\none day for what you had done. Imagine that Marguerite is married, and\ndeceive the husband; that is all. I have already told you all this\nonce, only at that time it was merely advice, and now it is almost a\nnecessity.\"\n\nWhat Prudence said was cruelly true.\n\n\"This is how it is,\" she went on, putting away the papers she had just\nshown me; \"women like Marguerite always foresee that someone will love\nthem, never that they will love; otherwise they would put aside money,\nand at thirty they could afford the luxury of having a lover for\nnothing. If I had only known once what I know now! In short, say nothing\nto Marguerite, and bring her back to Paris. You have lived with her\nalone for four or five months; that is quite enough. Shut your eyes now;\nthat is all that anyone asks of you. At the end of a fortnight she will\ntake the Comte de N., and she will save up during the winter, and next\nsummer you will begin over again. That is how things are done, my dear\nfellow!\"\n\nAnd Prudence appeared to be enchanted with her advice, which I refused\nindignantly.\n\nNot only my love and my dignity would not let me act thus, but I was\ncertain that, feeling as she did now, Marguerite would die rather than\naccept another lover.\n\n\"Enough joking,\" I said to Prudence; \"tell me exactly how much\nMarguerite is in need of.\"\n\n\"I have told you: thirty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"And when does she require this sum?\"\n\n\"Before the end of two months.\"\n\n\"She shall have it.\"\n\nPrudence shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"I will give it to you,\" I continued, \"but you must swear to me that you\nwill not tell Marguerite that I have given it to you.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid.\"\n\n\"And if she sends you anything else to sell or pawn, let me know.\"\n\n\"There is no danger. She has nothing left.\"\n\nI went straight to my own house to see if there were any letters from my\nfather. There were four.\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\nIn his first three letters my father inquired the cause of my silence;\nin the last he allowed me to see that he had heard of my change of life,\nand informed me that he was about to come and see me.\n\nI have always had a great respect and a sincere affection for my father.\nI replied that I had been travelling for a short time, and begged him\nto let me know beforehand what day he would arrive, so that I could be\nthere to meet him.\n\nI gave my servant my address in the country, telling him to bring me\nthe first letter that came with the postmark of C., then I returned to\nBougival.\n\nMarguerite was waiting for me at the garden gate. She looked at me\nanxiously. Throwing her arms round my neck, she said to me: \"Have you\nseen Prudence?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You were a long time in Paris.\"\n\n\"I found letters from my father to which I had to reply.\"\n\nA few minutes afterward Nanine entered, all out of breath. Marguerite\nrose and talked with her in whispers. When Nanine had gone out\nMarguerite sat down by me again and said, taking my hand:\n\n\"Why did you deceive me? You went to see Prudence.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"Nanine.\"\n\n\"And how did she know?\"\n\n\"She followed you.\"\n\n\"You told her to follow me?\"\n\n\"Yes. I thought that you must have had a very strong motive for going to\nParis, after not leaving me for four months. I was afraid that something\nmight happen to you, or that you were perhaps going to see another\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Child!\"\n\n\"Now I am relieved. I know what you have done, but I don't yet know what\nyou have been told.\"\n\nI showed Marguerite my father's letters.\n\n\"That is not what I am asking you about. What I want to know is why you\nwent to see Prudence.\"\n\n\"To see her.\"\n\n\"That's a lie, my friend.\"\n\n\"Well, I went to ask her if the horse was any better, and if she wanted\nyour shawl and your jewels any longer.\"\n\nMarguerite blushed, but did not answer.\n\n\"And,\" I continued, \"I learned what you had done with your horses,\nshawls, and jewels.\"\n\n\"And you are vexed?\"\n\n\"I am vexed that it never occurred to you to ask me for what you were in\nwant of.\"\n\n\"In a liaison like ours, if the woman has any sense of dignity at all,\nshe ought to make every possible sacrifice rather than ask her lover for\nmoney and so give a venal character to her love. You love me, I am sure,\nbut you do not know on how slight a thread depends the love one has\nfor a woman like me. Who knows? Perhaps some day when you were bored\nor worried you would fancy you saw a carefully concerted plan in our\nliaison. Prudence is a chatterbox. What need had I of the horses? It was\nan economy to sell them. I don't use them and I don't spend anything\non their keep; if you love me, I ask nothing more, and you will love me\njust as much without horses, or shawls, or diamonds.\"\n\nAll that was said so naturally that the tears came to my eyes as I\nlistened.\n\n\"But, my good Marguerite,\" I replied, pressing her hands lovingly, \"you\nknew that one day I should discover the sacrifice you had made, and that\nthe moment I discovered it I should allow it no longer.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because, my dear child, I can not allow your affection for me to\ndeprive you of even a trinket. I too should not like you to be able,\nin a moment when you were bored or worried, to think that if you were\nliving with somebody else those moments would not exist; and to repent,\nif only for a minute, of living with me. In a few days your horses,\nyour diamonds, and your shawls shall be returned to you. They are as\nnecessary to you as air is to life, and it may be absurd, but I like you\nbetter showy than simple.\"\n\n\"Then you no longer love me.\"\n\n\"Foolish creature!\"\n\n\"If you loved me, you would let me love you my own way; on the\ncontrary, you persist in only seeing in me a woman to whom luxury is\nindispensable, and whom you think you are always obliged to pay. You are\nashamed to accept the proof of my love. In spite of yourself, you think\nof leaving me some day, and you want to put your disinterestedness\nbeyond risk of suspicion. You are right, my friend, but I had better\nhopes.\"\n\nAnd Marguerite made a motion to rise; I held her, and said to her:\n\n\"I want you to be happy and to have nothing to reproach me for, that is\nall.\"\n\n\"And we are going to be separated!\"\n\n\"Why, Marguerite, who can separate us?\" I cried.\n\n\"You, who will not let me take you on your own level, but insist on\ntaking me on mine; you, who wish me to keep the luxury in the midst of\nwhich I have lived, and so keep the moral distance which separates us;\nyou, who do not believe that my affection is sufficiently disinterested\nto share with me what you have, though we could live happily enough on\nit together, and would rather ruin yourself, because you are still\nbound by a foolish prejudice. Do you really think that I could compare\na carriage and diamonds with your love? Do you think that my real\nhappiness lies in the trifles that mean so much when one has nothing\nto love, but which become trifling indeed when one has? You will pay my\ndebts, realize your estate, and then keep me? How long will that last?\nTwo or three months, and then it will be too late to live the life I\npropose, for then you will have to take everything from me, and that\nis what a man of honour can not do; while now you have eight or ten\nthousand francs a year, on which we should be able to live. I will sell\nthe rest of what I do not want, and with this alone I will make two\nthousand francs a year. We will take a nice little flat in which we can\nboth live. In the summer we will go into the country, not to a house\nlike this, but to a house just big enough for two people. You are\nindependent, I am free, we are young; in heaven's name, Armand, do not\ndrive me back into the life I had to lead once!\"\n\nI could not answer. Tears of gratitude and love filled my eyes, and I\nflung myself into Marguerite's arms.\n\n\"I wanted,\" she continued, \"to arrange everything without telling you,\npay all my debts, and take a new flat. In October we should have been\nback in Paris, and all would have come out; but since Prudence has\ntold you all, you will have to agree beforehand, instead of agreeing\nafterward. Do you love me enough for that?\"\n\nIt was impossible to resist such devotion. I kissed her hands ardently,\nand said:\n\n\"I will do whatever you wish.\"\n\nIt was agreed that we should do as she had planned. Thereupon, she went\nwild with delight; danced, sang, amused herself with calling up pictures\nof her new flat in all its simplicity, and began to consult me as to\nits position and arrangement. I saw how happy and proud she was of this\nresolution, which seemed as if it would bring us into closer and closer\nrelationship, and I resolved to do my own share. In an instant I decided\nthe whole course of my life. I put my affairs in order, and made over\nto Marguerite the income which had come to me from my mother, and which\nseemed little enough in return for the sacrifice which I was accepting.\nThere remained the five thousand francs a year from my father; and,\nwhatever happened, I had always enough to live on. I did not tell\nMarguerite what I had done, certain as I was that she would refuse the\ngift. This income came from a mortgage of sixty thousand francs on a\nhouse that I had never even seen. All that I knew was that every three\nmonths my father's solicitor, an old friend of the family, handed over\nto me seven hundred and fifty francs in return for my receipt.\n\nThe day when Marguerite and I came to Paris to look for a flat, I went\nto this solicitor and asked him what had to be done in order to make\nover this income to another person. The good man imagined I was ruined,\nand questioned me as to the cause of my decision. As I knew that I\nshould be obliged, sooner or later, to say in whose favour I made this\ntransfer, I thought it best to tell him the truth at once. He made none\nof the objections that his position as friend and solicitor authorized\nhim to make, and assured me that he would arrange the whole affair in\nthe best way possible. Naturally, I begged him to employ the greatest\ndiscretion in regard to my father, and on leaving him I rejoined\nMarguerite, who was waiting for me at Julie Duprat's, where she had gone\nin preference to going to listen to the moralizings of Prudence.\n\nWe began to look out for flats. All those that we saw seemed to\nMarguerite too dear, and to me too simple. However, we finally found,\nin one of the quietest parts of Paris, a little house, isolated from\nthe main part of the building. Behind this little house was a\ncharming garden, surrounded by walls high enough to screen us from our\nneighbours, and low enough not to shut off our own view. It was better\nthan our expectations.\n\nWhile I went to give notice at my own flat, Marguerite went to see\na business agent, who, she told me, had already done for one of her\nfriends exactly what she wanted him to do for her. She came on to the\nRue de Provence in a state of great delight. The man had promised to pay\nall her debts, to give her a receipt for the amount, and to hand over\nto her twenty thousand francs, in return for the whole of her furniture.\nYou have seen by the amount taken at the sale that this honest man would\nhave gained thirty thousand francs out of his client.\n\nWe went back joyously to Bougival, talking over our projects for the\nfuture, which, thanks to our heedlessness, and especially to our love,\nwe saw in the rosiest light.\n\nA week later, as we were having lunch, Nanine came to tell us that my\nservant was asking for me. \"Let him come in,\" I said.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"your father has arrived in Paris, and begs you to\nreturn at once to your rooms, where he is waiting for you.\"\n\nThis piece of news was the most natural thing in the world, yet, as we\nheard it, Marguerite and I looked at one another. We foresaw trouble.\nBefore she had spoken a word, I replied to her thought, and, taking her\nhand, I said, \"Fear nothing.\"\n\n\"Come back as soon as possible,\" whispered Marguerite, embracing me; \"I\nwill wait for you at the window.\"\n\nI sent on Joseph to tell my father that I was on my way. Two hours later\nI was at the Rue de Provence.\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\nMy father was seated in my room in his dressing-gown; he was writing,\nand I saw at once, by the way in which he raised his eyes to me when I\ncame in, that there was going to be a serious discussion. I went up to\nhim, all the same, as if I had seen nothing in his face, embraced him,\nand said:\n\n\"When did you come, father?\"\n\n\"Last night.\"\n\n\"Did you come straight here, as usual?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry not to have been here to receive you.\"\n\nI expected that the sermon which my father's cold face threatened would\nbegin at once; but he said nothing, sealed the letter which he had just\nwritten, and gave it to Joseph to post.\n\nWhen we were alone, my father rose, and leaning against the\nmantel-piece, said to me:\n\n\"My dear Armand, we have serious matters to discuss.\"\n\n\"I am listening, father.\"\n\n\"You promise me to be frank?\"\n\n\"Am I not accustomed to be so?\"\n\n\"Is it not true that you are living with a woman called Marguerite\nGautier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know what this woman was?\"\n\n\"A kept woman.\"\n\n\"And it is for her that you have forgotten to come and see your sister\nand me this year?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I admit it.\"\n\n\"You are very much in love with this woman?\"\n\n\"You see it, father, since she has made me fail in duty toward you, for\nwhich I humbly ask your forgiveness to-day.\"\n\nMy father, no doubt, was not expecting such categorical answers, for he\nseemed to reflect a moment, and then said to me:\n\n\"You have, of course, realized that you can not always live like that?\"\n\n\"I fear so, father, but I have not realized it.\"\n\n\"But you must realize,\" continued my father, in a dryer tone, \"that I,\nat all events, should not permit it.\"\n\n\"I have said to myself that as long as I did nothing contrary to the\nrespect which I owe to the traditional probity of the family I could\nlive as I am living, and this has reassured me somewhat in regard to the\nfears I have had.\"\n\nPassions are formidable enemies to sentiment. I was prepared for every\nstruggle, even with my father, in order that I might keep Marguerite.\n\n\"Then, the moment is come when you must live otherwise.\"\n\n\"Why, father?\"\n\n\"Because you are doing things which outrage the respect that you imagine\nyou have for your family.\"\n\n\"I don't follow your meaning.\"\n\n\"I will explain it to you. Have a mistress if you will; pay her as a\nman of honour is bound to pay the woman whom he keeps, by all means; but\nthat you should come to forget the most sacred things for her, that\nyou should let the report of your scandalous life reach my quiet\ncountryside, and set a blot on the honourable name that I have given\nyou, it can not, it shall not be.\"\n\n\"Permit me to tell you, father, that those who have given you\ninformation about me have been ill-informed. I am the lover of Mlle.\nGautier; I live with her; it is the most natural thing in the world.\nI do not give Mlle. Gautier the name you have given me; I spend on her\naccount what my means allow me to spend; I have no debts; and, in short,\nI am not in a position which authorizes a father to say to his son what\nyou have just said to me.\"\n\n\"A father is always authorized to rescue his son out of evil paths. You\nhave not done any harm yet, but you will do it.\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"Sir, I know more of life than you do. There are no entirely pure\nsentiments except in perfectly chaste women. Every Manon can have her\nown Des Grieux, and times are changed. It would be useless for the\nworld to grow older if it did not correct its ways. You will leave your\nmistress.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry to disobey you, father, but it is impossible.\"\n\n\"I will compel you to do so.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, father, there no longer exists a Sainte Marguerite to\nwhich courtesans can be sent, and, even if there were, I would follow\nMlle. Gautier if you succeeded in having her sent there. What would you\nhave? Perhaps am in the wrong, but I can only be happy as long as I am\nthe lover of this woman.\"\n\n\"Come, Armand, open your eyes. Recognise that it is your father who\nspeaks to you, your father who has always loved you, and who only\ndesires your happiness. Is it honourable for you to live like husband\nand wife with a woman whom everybody has had?\"\n\n\"What does it matter, father, if no one will any more? What does it\nmatter, if this woman loves me, if her whole life is changed through the\nlove which she has for me and the love which I have for her? What does\nit matter, if she has become a different woman?\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, sir, that the mission of a man of honour is to\ngo about converting lost women? Do you think that God has given such\na grotesque aim to life, and that the heart should have any room for\nenthusiasm of that kind? What will be the end of this marvellous cure,\nand what will you think of what you are saying to-day by the time you\nare forty? You will laugh at this love of yours, if you can still laugh,\nand if it has not left too serious a trace in your past. What would you\nbe now if your father had had your ideas and had given up his life\nto every impulse of this kind, instead of rooting himself firmly in\nconvictions of honour and steadfastness? Think it over, Armand, and do\nnot talk any more such absurdities. Come, leave this woman; your father\nentreats you.\"\n\nI answered nothing.\n\n\"Armand,\" continued my father, \"in the name of your sainted mother,\nabandon this life, which you will forget more easily than you think. You\nare tied to it by an impossible theory. You are twenty-four; think of\nthe future. You can not always love this woman, who also can not always\nlove you. You both exaggerate your love. You put an end to your whole\ncareer. One step further, and you will no longer be able to leave the\npath you have chosen, and you will suffer all your life for what you\nhave done in your youth. Leave Paris. Come and stay for a month or two\nwith your sister and me. Rest in our quiet family affection will soon\nheal you of this fever, for it is nothing else. Meanwhile, your mistress\nwill console herself; she will take another lover; and when you see what\nit is for which you have all but broken with your father, and all but\nlost his love, you will tell me that I have done well to come and\nseek you out, and you will thank me for it. Come, you will go with me,\nArmand, will you not?\" I felt that my father would be right if it had\nbeen any other woman, but I was convinced that he was wrong with regard\nto Marguerite. Nevertheless, the tone in which he said these last words\nwas so kind, so appealing, that I dared not answer.\n\n\"Well?\" said he in a trembling voice.\n\n\"Well, father, I can promise nothing,\" I said at last; \"what you ask\nof me is beyond my power. Believe me,\" I continued, seeing him make\nan impatient movement, \"you exaggerate the effects of this liaison.\nMarguerite is a different kind of a woman from what you think. This\nlove, far from leading me astray, is capable, on the contrary, of\nsetting me in the right direction. Love always makes a man better,\nno matter what woman inspires it. If you knew Marguerite, you would\nunderstand that I am in no danger. She is as noble as the noblest of\nwomen. There is as much disinterestedness in her as there is cupidity in\nothers.\"\n\n\"All of which does not prevent her from accepting the whole of your\nfortune, for the sixty thousand francs which come to you from your\nmother, and which you are giving her, are, understand me well, your\nwhole fortune.\"\n\nMy father had probably kept this peroration and this threat for the last\nstroke. I was firmer before these threats than before his entreaties.\n\n\"Who told you that I was handing this sum to her?\" I asked.\n\n\"My solicitor. Could an honest man carry out such a procedure without\nwarning me? Well, it is to prevent you from ruining yourself for a\nprostitute that I am now in Paris. Your mother, when she died, left you\nenough to live on respectably, and not to squander on your mistresses.\"\n\n\"I swear to you, father, that Marguerite knew nothing of this transfer.\"\n\n\"Why, then, do you make it?\"\n\n\"Because Marguerite, the woman you calumniate, and whom you wish me to\nabandon, is sacrificing all that she possesses in order to live with\nme.\"\n\n\"And you accept this sacrifice? What sort of a man are you, sir, to\nallow Mlle. Gautier to sacrifice anything for you? Come, enough of this.\nYou will leave this woman. Just now I begged you; now I command you. I\nwill have no such scandalous doings in my family. Pack up your things\nand get ready to come with me.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, father,\" I said, \"but I shall not come.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because I am at an age when no one any longer obeys a command.\"\n\nMy father turned pale at my answer.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said, \"I know what remains to be done.\"\n\nHe rang and Joseph appeared.\n\n\"Have my things taken to the Hotel de Paris,\" he said to my servant. And\nthereupon he went to his room and finished dressing. When he returned, I\nwent up to him.\n\n\"Promise me, father,\" I said, \"that you will do nothing to give\nMarguerite pain?\"\n\nMy father stopped, looked at me disdainfully, and contented himself with\nsaying, \"I believe you are mad.\" After this he went out, shutting the\ndoor violently after him.\n\nI went downstairs, took a cab, and returned to Bougival.\n\nMarguerite was waiting for me at the window.\n\n\n\nChapter 21\n\n\"At last you have come,\" she said, throwing her arms round my neck. \"But\nhow pale you are!\"\n\nI told her of the scene with my father.\n\n\"My God! I was afraid of it,\" she said. \"When Joseph came to tell you\nof your father's arrival I trembled as if he had brought news of some\nmisfortune. My poor friend, I am the cause of all your distress. You\nwill be better off, perhaps, if you leave me and do not quarrel\nwith your father on my account. He knows that you are sure to have a\nmistress, and he ought to be thankful that it is I, since I love you and\ndo not want more of you than your position allows. Did you tell him how\nwe had arranged our future?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is what annoyed him the most, for he saw how much we really\nlove one another.\"\n\n\"What are we to do, then?\"\n\n\"Hold together, my good Marguerite, and let the storm pass over.\"\n\n\"Will it pass?\"\n\n\"It will have to.\"\n\n\"But your father will not stop there.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose he can do?\"\n\n\"How do I know? Everything that a father can do to make his son obey\nhim. He will remind you of my past life, and will perhaps do me the\nhonour of inventing some new story, so that you may give me up.\"\n\n\"You know that I love you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what I know, too, is that, sooner or later, you will have to\nobey your father, and perhaps you will end by believing him.\"\n\n\"No, Marguerite. It is I who will make him believe me. Some of his\nfriends have been telling him tales which have made him angry; but he is\ngood and just, he will change his first impression; and then, after all,\nwhat does it matter to me?\"\n\n\"Do not say that, Armand. I would rather anything should happen than\nthat you should quarrel with your family; wait till after to-day, and\nto-morrow go back to Paris. Your father, too, will have thought it over\non his side, and perhaps you will both come to a better understanding.\nDo not go against his principles, pretend to make some concessions to\nwhat he wants; seem not to care so very much about me, and he will let\nthings remain as they are. Hope, my friend, and be sure of one thing,\nthat whatever happens, Marguerite will always be yours.\"\n\n\"You swear it?\"\n\n\"Do I need to swear it?\"\n\nHow sweet it is to let oneself be persuaded by the voice that one loves!\nMarguerite and I spent the whole day in talking over our projects for\nthe future, as if we felt the need of realizing them as quickly as\npossible. At every moment we awaited some event, but the day passed\nwithout bringing us any new tidings.\n\nNext day I left at ten o'clock, and reached the hotel about twelve. My\nfather had gone out.\n\nI went to my own rooms, hoping that he had perhaps gone there. No one\nhad called. I went to the solicitor's. No one was there. I went back to\nthe hotel, and waited till six. M. Duval did not return, and I went back\nto Bougival.\n\nI found Marguerite not waiting for me, as she had been the day before,\nbut sitting by the fire, which the weather still made necessary. She was\nso absorbed in her thoughts that I came close to her chair without her\nhearing me. When I put my lips to her forehead she started as if the\nkiss had suddenly awakened her.\n\n\"You frightened me,\" she said. \"And your father?\"\n\n\"I have not seen him. I do not know what it means. He was not at his\nhotel, nor anywhere where there was a chance of my finding him.\"\n\n\"Well, you must try again to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I am very much inclined to wait till he sends for me. I think I have\ndone all that can be expected of me.\"\n\n\"No, my friend, it is not enough; you must call on your father again,\nand you must call to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why to-morrow rather than any other day?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Marguerite, and it seemed to me that she blushed\nslightly at this question, \"because it will show that you are the more\nkeen about it, and he will forgive us the sooner.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the day Marguerite was sad and preoccupied. I had\nto repeat twice over everything I said to her to obtain an answer. She\nascribed this preoccupation to her anxiety in regard to the events which\nhad happened during the last two days. I spent the night in reassuring\nher, and she sent me away in the morning with an insistent disquietude\nthat I could not explain to myself.\n\nAgain my father was absent, but he had left this letter for me:\n\n\"If you call again to-day, wait for me till four. If I am not in by\nfour, come and dine with me to-morrow. I must see you.\"\n\nI waited till the hour he had named, but he did not appear. I returned\nto Bougival.\n\nThe night before I had found Marguerite sad; that night I found her\nfeverish and agitated. On seeing me, she flung her arms around my neck,\nbut she cried for a long time in my arms. I questioned her as to this\nsudden distress, which alarmed me by its violence. She gave me no\npositive reason, but put me off with those evasions which a woman\nresorts to when she will not tell the truth.\n\nWhen she was a little calmed down, I told her the result of my visit,\nand I showed her my father's letter, from which, I said, we might augur\nwell. At the sight of the letter and on hearing my comment, her tears\nbegan to flow so copiously that I feared an attack of nerves, and,\ncalling Nanine, I put her to bed, where she wept without a word, but\nheld my hands and kissed them every moment.\n\nI asked Nanine if, during my absence, her mistress had received any\nletter or visit which could account for the state in which I found her,\nbut Nanine replied that no one had called and nothing had been sent.\n\nSomething, however, had occurred since the day before, something which\ntroubled me the more because Marguerite concealed it from me.\n\nIn the evening she seemed a little calmer, and, making me sit at the\nfoot of the bed, she told me many times how much she loved me. She\nsmiled at me, but with an effort, for in spite of herself her eyes were\nveiled with tears.\n\nI used every means to make her confess the real cause of her distress,\nbut she persisted in giving me nothing but vague reasons, as I have\ntold you. At last she fell asleep in my arms, but it was the sleep which\ntires rather than rests the body. From time to time she uttered a cry,\nstarted up, and, after assuring herself that I was beside her, made me\nswear that I would always love her.\n\nI could make nothing of these intermittent paroxysms of distress, which\nwent on till morning. Then Marguerite fell into a kind of stupor. She\nhad not slept for two nights.\n\nHer rest was of short duration, for toward eleven she awoke, and, seeing\nthat I was up, she looked about her, crying:\n\n\"Are you going already?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, holding her hands; \"but I wanted to let you sleep on. It\nis still early.\"\n\n\"What time are you going to Paris?\"\n\n\"At four.\"\n\n\"So soon? But you will stay with me till then?\"\n\n\"Of course. Do I not always?\"\n\n\"I am so glad! Shall we have lunch?\" she went on absentmindedly.\n\n\"If you like.\"\n\n\"And then you will be nice to me till the very moment you go?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I will come back as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"You will come back?\" she said, looking at me with haggard eyes.\n\n\"Naturally.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will come back to-night. I shall wait for you, as I always\ndo, and you will love me, and we shall be happy, as we have been ever\nsince we have known each other.\"\n\nAll these words were said in such a strained voice, they seemed to hide\nso persistent and so sorrowful a thought, that I trembled every moment\nlest Marguerite should become delirious.\n\n\"Listen,\" I said. \"You are ill. I can not leave you like this. I will\nwrite and tell my father not to expect me.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried hastily, \"don't do that. Your father will accuse me\nof hindering you again from going to see him when he wants to see you;\nno, no, you must go, you must! Besides, I am not ill. I am quite well. I\nhad a bad dream and am not yet fully awake.\"\n\nFrom that moment Marguerite tried to seem more cheerful. There were no\nmore tears.\n\nWhen the hour came for me to go, I embraced her and asked her if she\nwould come with me as far as the train; I hoped that the walk would\ndistract her and that the air would do her good. I wanted especially to\nbe with her as long as possible.\n\nShe agreed, put on her cloak and took Nanine with her, so as not to\nreturn alone. Twenty times I was on the point of not going. But the\nhope of a speedy return, and the fear of offending my father still more,\nsustained me, and I took my place in the train.\n\n\"Till this evening!\" I said to Marguerite, as I left her. She did not\nreply.\n\nOnce already she had not replied to the same words, and the Comte de G.,\nyou will remember, had spent the night with her; but that time was so\nfar away that it seemed to have been effaced from my memory, and if I\nhad any fear, it was certainly not of Marguerite being unfaithful to me.\nReaching Paris, I hastened off to see Prudence, intending to ask her\nto go and keep Marguerite company, in the hope that her mirth and\nliveliness would distract her. I entered without being announced, and\nfound Prudence at her toilet.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, anxiously; \"is Marguerite with you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"She is not well.\"\n\n\"Is she not coming?\"\n\n\"Did you expect her?\"\n\nMadame Duvernoy reddened, and replied, with a certain constraint:\n\n\"I only meant that since you are at Paris, is she not coming to join\nyou?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI looked at Prudence; she cast down her eyes, and I read in her face the\nfear of seeing my visit prolonged.\n\n\"I even came to ask you, my dear Prudence, if you have nothing to do\nthis evening, to go and see Marguerite; you will be company for her,\nand you can stay the night. I never saw her as she was to-day, and I am\nafraid she is going to be ill.\"\n\n\"I am dining in town,\" replied Prudence, \"and I can't go and see\nMarguerite this evening. I will see her tomorrow.\"\n\nI took leave of Mme. Duvernoy, who seemed almost as preoccupied as\nMarguerite, and went on to my father's; his first glance seemed to study\nme attentively. He held out his hand.\n\n\"Your two visits have given me pleasure, Armand,\" he said; \"they make me\nhope that you have thought over things on your side as I have on mine.\"\n\n\"May I ask you, father, what was the result of your reflection?\"\n\n\"The result, my dear boy, is that I have exaggerated the importance of\nthe reports that had been made to me, and that I have made up my mind to\nbe less severe with you.\"\n\n\"What are you saying, father?\" I cried joyously.\n\n\"I say, my dear child, that every young man must have his mistress, and\nthat, from the fresh information I have had, I would rather see you the\nlover of Mlle. Gautier than of anyone else.\"\n\n\"My dear father, how happy you make me!\"\n\nWe talked in this manner for some moments, and then sat down to table.\nMy father was charming all dinner time.\n\nI was in a hurry to get back to Bougival to tell Marguerite about this\nfortunate change, and I looked at the clock every moment.\n\n\"You are watching the time,\" said my father, \"and you are impatient to\nleave me. O young people, how you always sacrifice sincere to doubtful\naffections!\"\n\n\"Do not say that, father; Marguerite loves me, I am sure of it.\"\n\nMy father did not answer; he seemed to say neither yes nor no.\n\nHe was very insistent that I should spend the whole evening with him and\nnot go till the morning; but Marguerite had not been well when I left\nher. I told him of it, and begged his permission to go back to her\nearly, promising to come again on the morrow.\n\nThe weather was fine; he walked with me as far as the station. Never had\nI been so happy. The future appeared as I had long desired to see it. I\nhad never loved my father as I loved him at that moment.\n\nJust as I was leaving him, he once more begged me to stay. I refused.\n\n\"You are really very much in love with her?\" he asked.\n\n\"Madly.\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" and he passed his hand across his forehead as if to chase\na thought, then opened his mouth as if to say something; but he only\npressed my hand, and left me hurriedly, saying:\n\n\"Till to-morrow, then!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\nIt seemed to me as if the train did not move. I reached Bougival at\neleven.\n\nNot a window in the house was lighted up, and when I rang no one\nanswered the bell. It was the first time that such a thing had occurred\nto me. At last the gardener came. I entered. Nanine met me with a light.\nI went to Marguerite's room.\n\n\"Where is madame?\"\n\n\"Gone to Paris,\" replied Nanine.\n\n\"To Paris!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"An hour after you.\"\n\n\"She left no word for me?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nNanine left me.\n\nPerhaps she had some suspicion or other, I thought, and went to Paris\nto make sure that my visit to my father was not an excuse for a day\noff. Perhaps Prudence wrote to her about something important. I said to\nmyself when I was alone; but I saw Prudence; she said nothing to make me\nsuppose that she had written to Marguerite.\n\nAll at once I remembered Mme. Duvernoy's question, \"Isn't she coming\nto-day?\" when I had said that Marguerite was ill. I remembered at the\nsame time how embarrassed Prudence had appeared when I looked at\nher after this remark, which seemed to indicate an appointment. I\nremembered, too, Marguerite's tears all day long, which my father's\nkind reception had rather put out of my mind. From this moment all the\nincidents grouped themselves about my first suspicion, and fixed it so\nfirmly in my mind that everything served to confirm it, even my father's\nkindness.\n\nMarguerite had almost insisted on my going to Paris; she had pretended\nto be calmer when I had proposed staying with her. Had I fallen into\nsome trap? Was Marguerite deceiving me? Had she counted on being back\nin time for me not to perceive her absence, and had she been detained by\nchance? Why had she said nothing to Nanine, or why had she not written?\nWhat was the meaning of those tears, this absence, this mystery?\n\nThat is what I asked myself in affright, as I stood in the vacant room,\ngazing at the clock, which pointed to midnight, and seemed to say to me\nthat it was too late to hope for my mistress's return. Yet, after all\nthe arrangements we had just made, after the sacrifices that had been\noffered and accepted, was it likely that she was deceiving me? No. I\ntried to get rid of my first supposition.\n\nProbably she had found a purchaser for her furniture, and she had\ngone to Paris to conclude the bargain. She did not wish to tell me\nbeforehand, for she knew that, though I had consented to it, the sale,\nso necessary to our future happiness, was painful to me, and she feared\nto wound my self-respect in speaking to me about it. She would rather\nnot see me till the whole thing was done, and that was evidently why\nPrudence was expecting her when she let out the secret. Marguerite could\nnot finish the whole business to-day, and was staying the night with\nPrudence, or perhaps she would come even now, for she must know bow\nanxious I should be, and would not wish to leave me in that condition.\nBut, if so, why those tears? No doubt, despite her love for me, the poor\ngirl could not make up her mind to give up all the luxury in which\nshe had lived until now, and for which she had been so envied, without\ncrying over it. I was quite ready to forgive her for such regrets. I\nwaited for her impatiently, that I might say to her, as I covered her\nwith kisses, that I had guessed the reason of her mysterious absence.\n\nNevertheless, the night went on, and Marguerite did not return.\n\nMy anxiety tightened its circle little by little, and began to oppress\nmy head and heart. Perhaps something had happened to her. Perhaps she\nwas injured, ill, dead. Perhaps a messenger would arrive with the news\nof some dreadful accident. Perhaps the daylight would find me with the\nsame uncertainty and with the same fears.\n\nThe idea that Marguerite was perhaps unfaithful to me at the very moment\nwhen I waited for her in terror at her absence did not return to my\nmind. There must be some cause, independent of her will, to keep her\naway from me, and the more I thought, the more convinced I was that this\ncause could only be some mishap or other. O vanity of man, coming back\nto us in every form!\n\nOne o'clock struck. I said to myself that I would wait another hour, but\nthat at two o'clock, if Marguerite had not returned, I would set out for\nParis. Meanwhile I looked about for a book, for I dared not think. Manon\nLescaut was open on the table. It seemed to me that here and there\nthe pages were wet as if with tears. I turned the leaves over and then\nclosed the book, for the letters seemed to me void of meaning through\nthe veil of my doubts.\n\nTime went slowly. The sky was covered with clouds. An autumn rain lashed\nthe windows. The empty bed seemed at moments to assume the aspect of a\ntomb. I was afraid.\n\nI opened the door. I listened, and heard nothing but the voice of the\nwind in the trees. Not a vehicle was to be seen on the road. The half\nhour sounded sadly from the church tower.\n\nI began to fear lest someone should enter. It seemed to me that only a\ndisaster could come at that hour and under that sombre sky.\n\nTwo o'clock struck. I still waited a little. Only the sound of the bell\ntroubled the silence with its monotonous and rhythmical stroke.\n\nAt last I left the room, where every object had assumed that melancholy\naspect which the restless solitude of the heart gives to all its\nsurroundings.\n\nIn the next room I found Nanine sleeping over her work. At the sound of\nthe door, she awoke and asked if her mistress had come in.\n\n\"No; but if she comes in, tell her that I was so anxious that I had to\ngo to Paris.\"\n\n\"At this hour?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"But how? You won't find a carriage.\"\n\n\"I will walk.\"\n\n\"But it is raining.\"\n\n\"No matter.\"\n\n\"But madame will be coming back, or if she doesn't come it will be\ntime enough in the morning to go and see what has kept her. You will be\nmurdered on the way.\"\n\n\"There is no danger, my dear Nanine; I will see you to-morrow.\"\n\nThe good girl went and got me a cloak, put it over my shoulders, and\noffered to wake up Mme. Arnould to see if a vehicle could be obtained;\nbut I would hear of nothing, convinced as I was that I should lose, in\na perhaps fruitless inquiry, more time than I should take to cover half\nthe road. Besides, I felt the need of air and physical fatigue in order\nto cool down the over-excitement which possessed me.\n\nI took the key of the flat in the Rue d'Antin, and after saying good-bye\nto Nanine, who came with me as far as the gate, I set out.\n\nAt first I began to run, but the earth was muddy with rain, and I\nfatigued myself doubly. At the end of half an hour I was obliged to\nstop, and I was drenched with sweat. I recovered my breath and went on.\nThe night was so dark that at every step I feared to dash myself against\none of the trees on the roadside, which rose up sharply before me like\ngreat phantoms rushing upon me.\n\nI overtook one or two wagons, which I soon left behind. A carriage was\ngoing at full gallop toward Bougival. As it passed me the hope came\nto me that Marguerite was in it. I stopped and cried out, \"Marguerite!\nMarguerite!\" But no one answered and the carriage continued its course.\nI watched it fade away in the distance, and then started on my way\nagain. I took two hours to reach the Barriere de l'Etoile. The sight of\nParis restored my strength, and I ran the whole length of the alley I\nhad so often walked.\n\nThat night no one was passing; it was like going through the midst of a\ndead city. The dawn began to break. When I reached the Rue d'Antin the\ngreat city stirred a little before quite awakening. Five o'clock struck\nat the church of Saint Roch at the moment when I entered Marguerite's\nhouse. I called out my name to the porter, who had had from me enough\ntwenty-franc pieces to know that I had the right to call on Mlle.\nGautier at five in the morning. I passed without difficulty. I might\nhave asked if Marguerite was at home, but he might have said \"No,\" and\nI preferred to remain in doubt two minutes longer, for, as long as I\ndoubted, there was still hope.\n\nI listened at the door, trying to discover a sound, a movement. Nothing.\nThe silence of the country seemed to be continued here. I opened the\ndoor and entered. All the curtains were hermetically closed. I drew\nthose of the dining-room and went toward the bed-room and pushed open\nthe door. I sprang at the curtain cord and drew it violently. The\ncurtain opened, a faint light made its way in. I rushed to the bed. It\nwas empty.\n\nI opened the doors one after another. I visited every room. No one. It\nwas enough to drive one mad.\n\nI went into the dressing-room, opened the window, and called Prudence\nseveral times. Mme. Duvernoy's window remained closed.\n\nI went downstairs to the porter and asked him if Mlle. Gautier had come\nhome during the day.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the man; \"with Mme. Duvernoy.\"\n\n\"She left no word for me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know what they did afterward?\"\n\n\"They went away in a carriage.\"\n\n\"What sort of a carriage?\"\n\n\"A private carriage.\"\n\nWhat could it all mean?\n\nI rang at the next door.\n\n\"Where are you going, sir?\" asked the porter, when he had opened to me.\n\n\"To Mme. Duvernoy's.\"\n\n\"She has not come back.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; here's a letter even, which was brought for her last night\nand which I have not yet given her.\"\n\nAnd the porter showed me a letter which I glanced at mechanically. I\nrecognised Marguerite's writing. I took the letter. It was addressed,\n\"To Mme. Duvernoy, to forward to M. Duval.\"\n\n\"This letter is for me,\" I said to the porter, as I showed him the\naddress.\n\n\"You are M. Duval?\" he replied.\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Ah! I remember. You often came to see Mme. Duvernoy.\"\n\nWhen I was in the street I broke the seal of the letter. If a\nthunder-bolt had fallen at my feet I should have been less startled than\nI was by what I read.\n\n\"By the time you read this letter, Armand, I shall be the mistress of\nanother man. All is over between us.\n\n\"Go back to your father, my friend, and to your sister, and there, by\nthe side of a pure young girl, ignorant of all our miseries, you will\nsoon forget what you would have suffered through that lost creature who\nis called Marguerite Gautier, whom you have loved for an instant, and\nwho owes to you the only happy moments of a life which, she hopes, will\nnot be very long now.\"\n\nWhen I had read the last word, I thought I should have gone mad. For\na moment I was really afraid of falling in the street. A cloud passed\nbefore my eyes and my blood beat in my temples. At last I came to myself\na little. I looked about me, and was astonished to see the life of\nothers continue without pausing at my distress.\n\nI was not strong enough to endure the blow alone. Then I remembered that\nmy father was in the same city, that I might be with him in ten minutes,\nand that, whatever might be the cause of my sorrow, he would share it.\n\nI ran like a madman, like a thief, to the Hotel de Paris; I found the\nkey in the door of my father's room; I entered. He was reading. He\nshowed so little astonishment at seeing me, that it was as if he was\nexpecting me. I flung myself into his arms without saying a word. I gave\nhim Marguerite's letter, and, falling on my knees beside his bed, I wept\nhot tears.\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\nWhen the current of life had resumed its course, I could not believe\nthat the day which I saw dawning would not be like those which had\npreceded it. There were moments when I fancied that some circumstance,\nwhich I could not recollect, had obliged me to spend the night away from\nMarguerite, but that, if I returned to Bougival, I should find her again\nas anxious as I had been, and that she would ask me what had detained me\naway from her so long.\n\nWhen one's existence has contracted a habit, such as that of this love,\nit seems impossible that the habit should be broken without at the same\ntime breaking all the other springs of life. I was forced from time to\ntime to reread Marguerite's letter, in order to convince myself that I\nhad not been dreaming.\n\nMy body, succumbing to the moral shock, was incapable of movement.\nAnxiety, the night walk, and the morning's news had prostrated me. My\nfather profited by this total prostration of all my faculties to demand\nof me a formal promise to accompany him. I promised all that he asked,\nfor I was incapable of sustaining a discussion, and I needed some\naffection to help me to live, after what had happened. I was too\nthankful that my father was willing to console me under such a calamity.\n\nAll that I remember is that on that day, about five o'clock, he took me\nwith him in a post-chaise. Without a word to me, he had had my luggage\npacked and put up behind the chaise with his own, and so he carried me\noff. I did not realize what I was doing until the town had disappeared\nand the solitude of the road recalled to me the emptiness of my heart.\nThen my tears again began to flow.\n\nMy father had realized that words, even from him, would do nothing to\nconsole me, and he let me weep without saying a word, only sometimes\npressing my hand, as if to remind me that I had a friend at my side.\n\nAt night I slept a little. I dreamed of Marguerite.\n\nI woke with a start, not recalling why I was in the carriage. Then the\ntruth came back upon me, and I let my head sink on my breast. I dared\nnot say anything to my father. I was afraid he would say, \"You see I was\nright when I declared that this woman did not love you.\" But he did not\nuse his advantage, and we reached C. without his having said anything\nto me except to speak of matters quite apart from the event which had\noccasioned my leaving Paris.\n\nWhen I embraced my sister, I remembered what Marguerite had said about\nher in her letter, and I saw at once how little my sister, good as she\nwas, would be able to make me forget my mistress.\n\nShooting had begun, and my father thought that it would be a distraction\nfor me. He got up shooting parties with friends and neighbours. I went\nwithout either reluctance or enthusiasm, with that sort of apathy into\nwhich I had sunk since my departure.\n\nWe were beating about for game and I was given my post. I put down my\nunloaded gun at my side, and meditated. I watched the clouds pass. I\nlet my thought wander over the solitary plains, and from time to time I\nheard someone call to me and point to a hare not ten paces off. None of\nthese details escaped my father, and he was not deceived by my exterior\ncalm. He was well aware that, broken as I now was, I should some day\nexperience a terrible reaction, which might be dangerous, and, without\nseeming to make any effort to console me, he did his utmost to distract\nmy thoughts.\n\nMy sister, naturally, knew nothing of what had happened, and she could\nnot understand how it was that I, who had formerly been so lighthearted,\nhad suddenly become so sad and dreamy.\n\nSometimes, surprising in the midst of my sadness my father's anxious\nscrutiny, I pressed his hand as if to ask him tacitly to forgive me for\nthe pain which, in spite of myself, I was giving him.\n\nThus a month passed, but at the end of that time I could endure it no\nlonger. The memory of Marguerite pursued me unceasingly. I had loved,\nI still loved this woman so much that I could not suddenly become\nindifferent to her. I had to love or to hate her. Above all, whatever I\nfelt for her, I had to see her again, and at once. This desire possessed\nmy mind, and with all the violence of a will which had begun to reassert\nitself in a body so long inert.\n\nIt was not enough for me to see Marguerite in a month, a week. I had to\nsee her the very next day after the day when the thought had occurred to\nme; and I went to my father and told him that I had been called to Paris\non business, but that I should return promptly. No doubt he guessed the\nreason of my departure, for he insisted that I should stay, but, seeing\nthat if I did not carry out my intention the consequences, in the state\nin which I was, might be fatal, he embraced me, and begged me, almost,\nwith tears, to return without delay.\n\nI did not sleep on the way to Paris. Once there, what was I going to\ndo? I did not know; I only knew that it must be something connected with\nMarguerite. I went to my rooms to change my clothes, and, as the weather\nwas fine and it was still early, I made my way to the Champs-Elysees. At\nthe end of half an hour I saw Marguerite's carriage, at some distance,\ncoming from the Rond-Point to the Place de la Concorde. She had\nrepurchased her horses, for the carriage was just as I was accustomed\nto see it, but she was not in it. Scarcely had I noticed this fact, when\nlooking around me, I saw Marguerite on foot, accompanied by a woman whom\nI had never seen.\n\nAs she passed me she turned pale, and a nervous smile tightened about\nher lips. For my part, my heart beat violently in my breast; but I\nsucceeded in giving a cold expression to my face, as I bowed coldly to\nmy former mistress, who just then reached her carriage, into which she\ngot with her friend.\n\nI knew Marguerite: this unexpected meeting must certainly have upset\nher. No doubt she had heard that I had gone away, and had thus been\nreassured as to the consequences of our rupture; but, seeing me again\nin Paris, finding herself face to face with me, pale as I was, she must\nhave realized that I had not returned without purpose, and she must have\nasked herself what that purpose was.\n\nIf I had seen Marguerite unhappy, if, in revenging myself upon her,\nI could have come to her aid, I should perhaps have forgiven her, and\ncertainly I should have never dreamt of doing her an injury. But I found\nher apparently happy, someone else had restored to her the luxury which\nI could not give her; her breaking with me seemed to assume a character\nof the basest self-interest; I was lowered in my own esteem as well as\nin my love. I resolved that she should pay for what I had suffered.\n\nI could not be indifferent to what she did, consequently what would hurt\nher the most would be my indifference; it was, therefore, this sentiment\nwhich I must affect, not only in her eyes, but in the eyes of others.\n\nI tried to put on a smiling countenance, and I went to call on\nPrudence. The maid announced me, and I had to wait a few minutes in\nthe drawing-room. At last Mme. Duvernoy appeared and asked me into her\nboudoir; as I seated myself I heard the drawing-room door open, a light\nfootstep made the floor creak and the front door was closed violently.\n\n\"I am disturbing you,\" I said to Prudence.\n\n\"Not in the least. Marguerite was there. When she heard you announced,\nshe made her escape; it was she who has just gone out.\"\n\n\"Is she afraid of me now?\"\n\n\"No, but she is afraid that you would not wish to see her.\"\n\n\"But why?\" I said, drawing my breath with difficulty, for I was choked\nwith emotion. \"The poor girl left me for her carriage, her furniture,\nand her diamonds; she did quite right, and I don't bear her any grudge.\nI met her to-day,\" I continued carelessly.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Prudence, looking at me and seeming to ask herself if\nthis was the same man whom she had known so madly in love.\n\n\"In the Champs-Elysees. She was with another woman, very pretty. Who is\nshe?\"\n\n\"What was she like?\"\n\n\"Blonde, slender, with side curls; blue eyes; very elegant.\"\n\n\"Ali! It was Olympe; she is really very pretty.\"\n\n\"Whom does she live with?\"\n\n\"With nobody; with anybody.\"\n\n\"Where does she live?\"\n\n\"Rue Troncliet, No.--. Do you want to make love to her?\"\n\n\"One never knows.\"\n\n\"And Marguerite?\"\n\n\"I should hardly tell you the truth if I said I think no more about her;\nbut I am one of those with whom everything depends on the way in which\none breaks with them. Now Marguerite ended with me so lightly that I\nrealize I was a great fool to have been as much in love with her as I\nwas, for I was really very much in love with that girl.\"\n\nYou can imagine the way in which I said that; the sweat broke out on my\nforehead.\n\n\"She was very fond of you, you know, and she still is; the proof is,\nthat after meeting you to-day, she came straight to tell me about it.\nWhen she got here she was all of a tremble; I thought she was going to\nfaint.\"\n\n\"Well, what did she say?\"\n\n\"She said, 'He is sure to come here,' and she begged me to ask you to\nforgive her.\"\n\n\"I have forgiven her, you may tell her. She was a good girl; but, after\nall, like the others, and I ought to have expected what happened. I am\neven grateful to her, for I see now what would have happened if I had\nlived with her altogether. It was ridiculous.\"\n\n\"She will be very glad to find that you take it so well. It was quite\ntime she left you, my dear fellow. The rascal of an agent to whom she\nhad offered to sell her furniture went around to her creditors to find\nout how much she owed; they took fright, and in two days she would have\nbeen sold up.\"\n\n\"And now it is all paid?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"And who has supplied the money?\"\n\n\"The Comte de N. Ah, my dear friend, there are men made on purpose for\nsuch occasions. To cut a long story short he gave her twenty thousand\nfrancs, but he has had his way at last. He knows quite well that\nMarguerite is not in love with him; but he is very nice with her all the\nsame. As you have seen, he has repurchased her horses, he has taken her\njewels out of pawn, and he gives her as much money as the duke used to\ngive her; if she likes to live quietly, he will stay with her a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"And what is she doing? Is she living in Paris altogether?\"\n\n\"She would never go back to Bougival after you went. I had to go myself\nand see after all her things, and yours, too. I made a package of them\nand you can send here for them. You will find everything, except a\nlittle case with your initials. Marguerite wanted to keep it. If you\nreally want it, I will ask her for it.\"\n\n\"Let her keep it,\" I stammered, for I felt the tears rise from my heart\nto my eyes at the recollection of the village where I had been so happy,\nand at the thought that Marguerite cared to keep something which had\nbelonged to me and would recall me to her. If she had entered at that\nmoment my thoughts of vengeance would have disappeared, and I should\nhave fallen at her feet.\n\n\"For the rest,\" continued Prudence, \"I never saw her as she is now; she\nhardly takes any sleep, she goes to all the balls, she goes to suppers,\nshe even drinks. The other day, after a supper, she had to stay in bed\nfor a week; and when the doctor let her get up, she began again at the\nrisk of her life. Shall you go and see her?\"\n\n\"What is the good? I came to see you, because you have always been\ncharming to me, and I knew you before I ever knew Marguerite. I owe\nit to you that I have been her lover, and also, don't I, that I am her\nlover no longer?\"\n\n\"Well, I did all I could to get her away from you, and I believe you\nwill be thankful to me later on.\"\n\n\"I owe you a double gratitude,\" I added, rising, for I was disgusted\nwith the woman, seeing her take every word I said to her as if it were\nserious.\n\n\"You are going?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI had learned enough.\n\n\"When shall I be seeing you?\"\n\n\"Soon. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\nPrudence saw me to the door, and I went back to my own rooms with tears\nof rage in my eyes and a desire for vengeance in my heart.\n\nSo Marguerite was no different from the others; so the steadfast love\nthat she had had for me could not resist the desire of returning to\nher former life, and the need of having a carriage and plunging into\ndissipation. So I said to myself, as I lay awake at night though if I\nhad reflected as calmly as I professed to I should have seen in this\nnew and turbulent life of Marguerite the attempt to silence a constant\nthought, a ceaseless memory. Unfortunately, evil passion had the upper\nhand, and I only sought for some means of avenging myself on the poor\ncreature. Oh, how petty and vile is man when he is wounded in one of his\nnarrow passions!\n\nThis Olympe whom I had seen was, if not a friend of Marguerite, at all\nevents the woman with whom she was most often seen since her return to\nParis. She was going to give a ball, and, as I took it for granted that\nMarguerite would be there, I tried to get an invitation and succeeded.\n\nWhen, full of my sorrowful emotions, I arrived at the ball, it was\nalready very animated. They were dancing, shouting even, and in one of\nthe quadrilles I perceived Marguerite dancing with the Comte de N., who\nseemed proud of showing her off, as if he said to everybody: \"This woman\nis mine.\"\n\nI leaned against the mantel-piece just opposite Marguerite and watched\nher dancing. Her face changed the moment she caught sight of me. I\nsaluted her casually with a glance of the eyes and a wave of the hand.\n\nWhen I reflected that after the ball she would go home, not with me but\nwith that rich fool, when I thought of what would follow their return,\nthe blood rose to my face, and I felt the need of doing something to\ntrouble their relations.\n\nAfter the contredanse I went up to the mistress of the house, who\ndisplayed for the benefit of her guests a dazzling bosom and magnificent\nshoulders. She was beautiful, and, from the point of view of figure,\nmore beautiful than Marguerite. I realized this fact still more clearly\nfrom certain glances which Marguerite bestowed upon her while I was\ntalking with her. The man who was the lover of such a woman might well\nbe as proud as M. de N., and she was beautiful enough to inspire a\npassion not less great than that which Marguerite had inspired in me. At\nthat moment she had no lover. It would not be difficult to become so; it\ndepended only on showing enough money to attract her attention.\n\nI made up my mind. That woman should be my mistress. I began by dancing\nwith her. Half an hour afterward, Marguerite, pale as death, put on her\npelisse and left the ball.\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\nIt was something already, but it was not enough. I saw the hold which I\nhad upon this woman, and I took a cowardly advantage of it.\n\nWhen I think that she is dead now, I ask myself if God will ever forgive\nme for the wrong I did her.\n\nAfter the supper, which was noisy as could be, there was gambling. I sat\nby the side of Olympe and put down my money so recklessly that she could\nnot but notice me. In an instant I had gained one hundred and fifty or\ntwo hundred louis, which I spread out before me on the table, and on\nwhich she fastened her eyes greedily.\n\nI was the only one not completely absorbed by the game, and able to pay\nher some attention. All the rest of the night I gained, and it was I\nwho gave her money to play, for she had lost all she had before her and\nprobably all she had in the house.\n\nAt five in the morning, the guests departed. I had gained three hundred\nlouis.\n\nAll the players were already on their way downstairs; I was the only\none who had remained behind, and as I did not know any of them, no one\nnoticed it. Olympe herself was lighting the way, and I was going to\nfollow the others, when, turning back, I said to her:\n\n\"I must speak to you.\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" she said.\n\n\"No, now.\"\n\n\"What have you to say?\"\n\n\"You will see.\"\n\nAnd I went back into the room.\n\n\"You have lost,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"All that you had in the house?\"\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n\"Be frank.\"\n\n\"Well, it is true.\"\n\n\"I have won three hundred louis. Here they are, if you will let me stay\nhere to-night.\"\n\nAnd I threw the gold on the table.\n\n\"And why this proposition?\"\n\n\"Because I am in love with you, of course.\"\n\n\"No, but because you love Marguerite, and you want to have your revenge\nupon her by becoming my lover. You don't deceive a woman like me, my\ndear friend; unluckily, I am still too young and too good-looking to\naccept the part that you offer me.\"\n\n\"So you refuse?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Would you rather take me for nothing? It is I who wouldn't accept then.\nThink it over, my dear Olympe; if I had sent someone to offer you these\nthree hundred louis on my behalf, on the conditions I attach to them,\nyou would have accepted. I preferred to speak to you myself. Accept\nwithout inquiring into my reasons; say to yourself that you are\nbeautiful, and that there is nothing surprising in my being in love with\nyou.\"\n\nMarguerite was a woman in the same position as Olympe, and yet I should\nnever have dared say to her the first time I met her what I had said to\nthe other woman. I loved Marguerite. I saw in her instincts which were\nlacking in the other, and at the very moment in which I made my bargain,\nI felt a disgust toward the woman with whom I was making it.\n\nShe accepted, of course, in the end, and at midday I left her house as\nher lover; but I quitted her without a recollection of the caresses\nand of the words of love which she had felt bound to shower upon me in\nreturn for the six thousand francs which I left with her. And yet there\nwere men who had ruined themselves for that woman.\n\nFrom that day I inflicted on Marguerite a continual persecution. Olympe\nand she gave up seeing one another, as you might imagine. I gave my\nnew mistress a carriage and jewels. I gambled, I committed every\nextravagance which could be expected of a man in love with such a woman\nas Olympe. The report of my new infatuation was immediately spread\nabroad.\n\nPrudence herself was taken in, and finally thought that I had completely\nforgotten Marguerite. Marguerite herself, whether she guessed my motive\nor was deceived like everybody else, preserved a perfect dignity in\nresponse to the insults which I heaped upon her daily. Only, she seemed\nto suffer, for whenever I met her she was more and more pale, more\nand more sad. My love for her, carried to the point at which it was\ntransformed into hatred, rejoiced at the sight of her daily sorrow.\nOften, when my cruelty toward her became infamous, Marguerite lifted\nupon me such appealing eyes that I blushed for the part I was playing,\nand was ready to implore her forgiveness.\n\nBut my repentance was only of a moment's duration, and Olympe, who had\nfinally put aside all self-respect, and discovered that by annoying\nMarguerite she could get from me whatever she wanted, constantly stirred\nup my resentment against her, and insulted her whenever she found an\nopportunity, with the cowardly persistence of a woman licensed by the\nauthority of a man.\n\nAt last Marguerite gave up going to balls or theatres, for fear of\nmeeting Olympe and me. Then direct impertinences gave way to anonymous\nletters, and there was not a shameful thing which I did not encourage\nmy mistress to relate and which I did not myself relate in reference to\nMarguerite.\n\nTo reach such a point I must have been literally mad. I was like a man\ndrunk upon bad wine, who falls into one of those nervous exaltations in\nwhich the hand is capable of committing a crime without the head knowing\nanything about it. In the midst of it all I endured a martyrdom. The\nnot disdainful calm, the not contemptuous dignity with which Marguerite\nresponded to all my attacks, and which raised her above me in my own\neyes, enraged me still more against her.\n\nOne evening Olympe had gone somewhere or other, and had met Marguerite,\nwho for once had not spared the foolish creature, so that she had had to\nretire in confusion. Olympe returned in a fury, and Marguerite fainted\nand had to be carried out. Olympe related to me what had happened,\ndeclared that Marguerite, seeing her alone, had revenged herself upon\nher because she was my mistress, and that I must write and tell her to\nrespect the woman whom I loved, whether I was present or absent.\n\nI need not tell you that I consented, and that I put into the letter\nwhich I sent to her address the same day, everything bitter, shameful,\nand cruel that I could think of.\n\nThis time the blow was more than the unhappy creature could endure\nwithout replying. I felt sure that an answer would come, and I resolved\nnot to go out all day. About two there was a ring, and Prudence entered.\n\nI tried to assume an indifferent air as I asked her what had brought\nher; but that day Mme. Duvernoy was not in a laughing humour, and in a\nreally moved voice she said to me that since my return, that is to say\nfor about three weeks, I had left no occasion untried which could give\npain to Marguerite, that she was completely upset by it, and that the\nscene of last night and my angry letter of the morning had forced her to\ntake to her bed. In short, without making any reproach, Marguerite\nsent to ask me for a little pity, since she had no longer the moral or\nphysical strength to endure what I was making her suffer.\n\n\"That Mlle. Gautier,\" I said to Prudence, \"should turn me out of her own\nhouse is quite reasonable, but that she should insult the woman whom I\nlove, under the pretence that this woman is my mistress, is a thing I\nwill never permit.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Prudence, \"you are under the influence of a woman who\nhas neither heart nor sense; you are in love with her, it is true, but\nthat is not a reason for torturing a woman who can not defend herself.\"\n\n\"Let Mlle. Gautier send me her Comte de N. and the sides will be equal.\"\n\n\"You know very well that she will not do that. So, my dear Armand, let\nher alone. If you saw her you would be ashamed of the way in which you\nare treating her. She is white, she coughs--she won't last long now.\"\n\nAnd Prudence held out her hand to me, adding:\n\n\"Come and see her; it will make her very happy.\"\n\n\"I have no desire to meet M. de N.\"\n\n\"M. de N. is never there. She can not endure him.\"\n\n\"If Marguerite wishes to see me, she knows where I live; let her come to\nsee me, but, for my part, I will never put foot in the Rue d'Antin.\"\n\n\"Will you receive her well?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sure that she will come.\"\n\n\"Let her come.\"\n\n\"Shall you be out to-day?\"\n\n\"I shall be at home all the evening.\"\n\n\"I will tell her.\"\n\nAnd Prudence left me.\n\nI did not even write to tell Olympe not to expect me. I never troubled\nmuch about her, scarcely going to see her one night a week. She consoled\nherself, I believe, with an actor from some theatre or other.\n\nI went out for dinner and came back almost immediately. I had a fire lit\nin my room and I told Joseph he could go out.\n\nI can give you no idea of the different impressions which agitated me\nduring the hour in which I waited; but when, toward nine o'clock, I\nheard a ring, they thronged together into one such emotion, that, as I\nopened the door, I was obliged to lean against the wall to keep myself\nfrom falling.\n\nFortunately the anteroom was in half darkness, and the change in my\ncountenance was less visible. Marguerite entered.\n\nShe was dressed in black and veiled. I could scarcely recognise her face\nthrough the veil. She went into the drawing-room and raised her veil.\nShe was pale as marble.\n\n\"I am here, Armand,\" she said; \"you wished to see me and I have come.\"\n\nAnd letting her head fall on her hands, she burst into tears.\n\nI went up to her.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I said to her in a low voice.\n\nShe pressed my hand without a word, for tears still veiled her voice.\nBut after a few minutes, recovering herself a little, she said to me:\n\n\"You have been very unkind to me, Armand, and I have done nothing to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" I answered, with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Nothing but what circumstances forced me to do.\"\n\nI do not know if you have ever in your life experienced, or if you will\never experience, what I felt at the sight of Marguerite.\n\nThe last time she had come to see me she had sat in the same place where\nshe was now sitting; only, since then, she had been the mistress of\nanother man, other kisses than mine had touched her lips, toward which,\nin spite of myself, my own reached out, and yet I felt that I loved this\nwoman as much, more perhaps, than I had ever loved her.\n\nIt was difficult for me to begin the conversation on the subject which\nbrought her. Marguerite no doubt realized it, for she went on:\n\n\"I have come to trouble you, Armand, for I have two things to ask:\npardon for what I said yesterday to Mlle. Olympe, and pity for what you\nare perhaps still ready to do to me. Intentionally or not, since your\nreturn you have given me so much pain that I should be incapable now of\nenduring a fourth part of what I have endured till now. You will have\npity on me, won't you? And you will understand that a man who is not\nheartless has other nobler things to do than to take his revenge upon a\nsick and sad woman like me. See, take my hand. I am in a fever. I left\nmy bed to come to you, and ask, not for your friendship, but for your\nindifference.\"\n\nI took Marguerite's hand. It was burning, and the poor woman shivered\nunder her fur cloak.\n\nI rolled the arm-chair in which she was sitting up to the fire.\n\n\"Do you think, then, that I did not suffer,\" said I, \"on that night\nwhen, after waiting for you in the country, I came to look for you in\nParis, and found nothing but the letter which nearly drove me mad? How\ncould you have deceived me, Marguerite, when I loved you so much?\n\n\"Do not speak of that, Armand; I did not come to speak of that. I wanted\nto see you only not an enemy, and I wanted to take your hand once more.\nYou have a mistress; she is young, pretty, you love her they say. Be\nhappy with her and forget me.\"\n\n\"And you. You are happy, no doubt?\"\n\n\"Have I the face of a happy woman, Armand? Do not mock my sorrow, you,\nwho know better than anyone what its cause and its depth are.\"\n\n\"It only depended on you not to have been unhappy at all, if you are as\nyou say.\"\n\n\"No, my friend; circumstances were stronger than my will. I obeyed,\nnot the instincts of a light woman, as you seem to say, but a serious\nnecessity, and reasons which you will know one day, and which will make\nyou forgive me.\"\n\n\"Why do you not tell me those reasons to-day?\"\n\n\"Because they would not bring about an impossible reunion between us,\nand they would separate you perhaps from those from whom you must not be\nseparated.\"\n\n\"Who do you mean?\"\n\n\"I can not tell you.\"\n\n\"Then you are lying to me.\"\n\nMarguerite rose and went toward the door. I could not behold this silent\nand expressive sorrow without being touched, when I compared in my mind\nthis pale and weeping woman with the madcap who had made fun of me at\nthe Opera Comique.\n\n\"You shall not go,\" I said, putting myself in front of the door.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because, in spite of what you have done to me, I love you always, and I\nwant you to stay here.\"\n\n\"To turn me out to-morrow? No; it is impossible. Our destinies are\nseparate; do not try to reunite them. You will despise me perhaps, while\nnow you can only hate me.\"\n\n\"No, Marguerite,\" I cried, feeling all my love and all my desire\nreawaken at the contact of this woman. \"No, I will forget everything,\nand we will be happy as we promised one another that we would be.\"\n\nMarguerite shook her head doubtfully, and said:\n\n\"Am I not your slave, your dog? Do with me what you will. Take me; I am\nyours.\"\n\nAnd throwing off her cloak and hat, she flung them on the sofa, and\nbegan hurriedly to undo the front of her dress, for, by one of those\nreactions so frequent in her malady, the blood rushed to her head and\nstifled her. A hard, dry cough followed.\n\n\"Tell my coachman,\" she said, \"to go back with the carriage.\"\n\nI went down myself and sent him away. When I returned Marguerite was\nlying in front of the fire, and her teeth chattered with the cold.\n\nI took her in my arms. I undressed her, without her making a movement,\nand carried her, icy cold, to the bed. Then I sat beside her and tried\nto warm her with my caresses. She did not speak a word, but smiled at\nme.\n\nIt was a strange night. All Marguerite's life seemed to have passed into\nthe kisses with which she covered me, and I loved her so much that in\nmy transports of feverish love I asked myself whether I should not kill\nher, so that she might never belong to another.\n\nA month of love like that, and there would have remained only the corpse\nof heart or body.\n\nThe dawn found us both awake. Marguerite was livid white. She did not\nspeak a word. From time to time, big tears rolled from her eyes, and\nstayed upon her cheeks, shining like diamonds. Her thin arms opened,\nfrom time to time, to hold me fast, and fell back helplessly upon the\nbed.\n\nFor a moment it seemed to me as if I could forget all that had passed\nsince I had left Bougival, and I said to Marguerite:\n\n\"Shall we go away and leave Paris?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she said, almost with affright; \"we should be too unhappy. I\ncan do no more to make you happy, but while there is a breath of life in\nme, I will be the slave of your fancies. At whatever hour of the day or\nnight you will, come, and I will be yours; but do not link your future\nany more with mine, you would be too unhappy and you would make me too\nunhappy. I shall still be pretty for a while; make the most of it, but\nask nothing more.\"\n\nWhen she had gone, I was frightened at the solitude in which she left\nme. Two hours afterward I was still sitting on the side of the bed,\nlooking at the pillow which kept the imprint of her form, and asking\nmyself what was to become of me, between my love and my jealousy.\n\nAt five o'clock, without knowing what I was going to do, I went to the\nRue d'Antin.\n\nNanine opened to me.\n\n\"Madame can not receive you,\" she said in an embarrassed way.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because M. le Comte de N. is there, and he has given orders to let no\none in.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I stammered; \"I forgot.\"\n\nI went home like a drunken man, and do you know what I did during the\nmoment of jealous delirium which was long enough for the shameful thing\nI was going to do? I said to myself that the woman was laughing at me; I\nsaw her alone with the count, saying over to him the same words that she\nhad said to me in the night, and taking a five-hundred-franc note I sent\nit to her with these words:\n\n\"You went away so suddenly that I forgot to pay you. Here is the price\nof your night.\"\n\nThen when the letter was sent I went out as if to free myself from the\ninstantaneous remorse of this infamous action.\n\nI went to see Olympe, whom I found trying on dresses, and when we were\nalone she sang obscene songs to amuse me. She was the very type of the\nshameless, heartless, senseless courtesan, for me at least, for perhaps\nsome men might have dreamed of her as I dreamed of Marguerite. She asked\nme for money. I gave it to her, and, free then to go, I returned home.\n\nMarguerite had not answered.\n\nI need not tell you in what state of agitation I spent the next day. At\nhalf past nine a messenger brought me an envelope containing my letter\nand the five-hundred-franc note, not a word more.\n\n\"Who gave you this?\" I asked the man.\n\n\"A lady who was starting with her maid in the next mail for Boulogne,\nand who told me not to take it until the coach was out of the\ncourtyard.\"\n\nI rushed to the Rue d'Antin.\n\n\"Madame left for England at six o'clock,\" said the porter.\n\nThere was nothing to hold me in Paris any longer, neither hate nor love.\nI was exhausted by this series of shocks. One of my friends was setting\nout on a tour in the East. I told my father I should like to accompany\nhim; my father gave me drafts and letters of introduction, and eight or\nten days afterward I embarked at Marseilles.\n\nIt was at Alexandria that I learned from an attache at the embassy, whom\nI had sometimes seen at Marguerite's, that the poor girl was seriously\nill.\n\nI then wrote her the letter which she answered in the way you know; I\nreceived it at Toulon.\n\nI started at once, and you know the rest.\n\nNow you have only to read a few sheets which Julie Duprat gave me; they\nare the best commentary on what I have just told you.\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\nArmand, tired by this long narrative, often interrupted by his tears,\nput his two hands over his forehead and closed his eyes to think, or\nto try to sleep, after giving me the pages written by the hand of\nMarguerite. A few minutes after, a more rapid breathing told me that\nArmand slept, but that light sleep which the least sound banishes.\n\nThis is what I read; I copy it without adding or omitting a syllable:\n\nTo-day is the 15th December. I have been ill three or four days. This\nmorning I stayed in bed. The weather is dark, I am sad; there is no one\nby me. I think of you, Armand. And you, where are you, while I write\nthese lines? Far from Paris, far, far, they tell me, and perhaps you\nhave already forgotten Marguerite. Well, be happy; I owe you the only\nhappy moments in my life.\n\nI can not help wanting to explain all my conduct to you, and I have\nwritten you a letter; but, written by a girl like me, such a letter\nmight seem to be a lie, unless death had sanctified it by its authority,\nand, instead of a letter, it were a confession.\n\nTo-day I am ill; I may die of this illness, for I have always had the\npresentiment that I shall die young. My mother died of consumption, and\nthe way I have always lived could but increase the only heritage she\never left me. But I do not want to die without clearing up for you\neverything about me; that is, if, when you come back, you will still\ntrouble yourself about the poor girl whom you loved before you went\naway.\n\nThis is what the letter contained; I shall like writing it over again,\nso as to give myself another proof of my own justification.\n\nYou remember, Armand, how the arrival of your father surprised us at\nBougival; you remember the involuntary fright that his arrival caused\nme, and the scene which took place between you and him, which you told\nme of in the evening.\n\nNext day, when you were at Paris, waiting for your father, and he did\nnot return, a man came to the door and handed in a letter from M. Duval.\n\nHis letter, which I inclose with this, begged me, in the most serious\nterms, to keep you away on the following day, on some excuse or\nother, and to see your father, who wished to speak to me, and asked me\nparticularly not to say anything to you about it.\n\nYou know how I insisted on your returning to Paris next day.\n\nYou had only been gone an hour when your father presented himself. I\nwon't say what impression his severe face made upon me. Your father had\nthe old theory that a courtesan is a being without heart or reason, a\nsort of machine for coining gold, always ready, like the machine,\nto bruise the hand that gives her everything, and to tear in pieces,\nwithout pity or discernment, those who set her in motion.\n\nYour father had written me a very polite letter, in order that I might\nconsent to see him; he did not present himself quite as he had written.\nHis manner at first was so stiff, insolent, and even threatening, that I\nhad to make him understand that I was in my own house, and that I had no\nneed to render him an account of my life, except because of the sincere\naffection which I had for his son.\n\nM. Duval calmed down a little, but still went on to say that he could\nnot any longer allow his son to ruin himself over me; that I was\nbeautiful, it was true, but, however beautiful I might be, I ought not\nto make use of my beauty to spoil the future of a young man by such\nexpenditure as I was causing.\n\nAt that there was only one thing to do, to show him the proof that since\nI was your mistress I had spared no sacrifice to be faithful to you\nwithout asking for more money than you had to give me. I showed him the\npawn tickets, the receipts of the people to whom I had sold what I could\nnot pawn; I told him of my resolve to part with my furniture in order\nto pay my debts, and live with you without being a too heavy expense. I\ntold him of our happiness, of how you had shown me the possibility of\na quieter and happier life, and he ended by giving in to the evidence,\noffering me his hand, and asking pardon for the way in which he had at\nfirst approached me.\n\nThen he said to me:\n\n\"So, madame, it is not by remonstrances or by threats, but by\nentreaties, that I must endeavour to obtain from you a greater sacrifice\nthan you have yet made for my son.\"\n\nI trembled at this beginning.\n\nYour father came over to me, took both my hands, and continued in an\naffectionate voice:\n\n\"My child, do not take what I have to say to you amiss; only remember\nthat there are sometimes in life cruel necessities for the heart, but\nthat they must be submitted to. You are good, your soul has generosity\nunknown to many women who perhaps despise you, and are less worthy than\nyou. But remember that there is not only the mistress, but the family;\nthat besides love there are duties; that to the age of passion succeeds\nthe age when man, if he is to be respected, must plant himself solidly\nin a serious position. My son has no fortune, and yet he is ready to\nabandon to you the legacy of his mother. If he accepted from you the\nsacrifice which you are on the point of making, his honour and dignity\nwould require him to give you, in exchange for it, this income, which\nwould always put you out of danger of adversity. But he can not accept\nthis sacrifice, because the world, which does not know you, would give a\nwrong interpretation to this acceptance, and such an interpretation must\nnot tarnish the name which we bear. No one would consider whether\nArmand loves you, whether you love him, whether this mutual love means\nhappiness to him and redemption to you; they would see only one thing,\nthat Armand Duval allowed a kept woman (forgive me, my child, for what\nI am forced to say to you) to sell all she had for him. Then the day of\nreproaches and regrets would arrive, be sure, for you or for others, and\nyou would both bear a chain that you could not sever. What would you do\nthen? Your youth would be lost, my son's future destroyed; and I, his\nfather, should receive from only one of my children the recompense that\nI look for from both.\n\n\"You are young, beautiful, life will console you; you are noble, and the\nmemory of a good deed will redeem you from many past deeds. During the\nsix months that he has known you Armand has forgotten me. I wrote to him\nfour times, and he has never once replied. I might have died and he not\nknown it!\n\n\"Whatever may be your resolution of living otherwise than as you have\nlived, Armand, who loves you, will never consent to the seclusion to\nwhich his modest fortune would condemn you, and to which your beauty\ndoes not entitle you. Who knows what he would do then! He has gambled,\nI know; without telling you of it, I know also, but, in a moment of\nmadness, he might have lost part of what I have saved, during many\nyears, for my daughter's portion, for him, and for the repose of my old\nage. What might have happened may yet happen.\n\n\"Are you sure, besides, that the life which you are giving up for him\nwill never again come to attract you? Are you sure, you who have loved\nhim, that you will never love another? Would you not-suffer on seeing\nthe hindrances set by your love to your lover's life, hindrances for\nwhich you would be powerless to console him, if, with age, thoughts of\nambition should succeed to dreams of love? Think over all that, madame.\nYou love Armand; prove it to him by the sole means which remains to you\nof yet proving it to him, by sacrificing your love to his future. No\nmisfortune has yet arrived, but one will arrive, and perhaps a greater\none than those which I foresee. Armand might become jealous of a man who\nhas loved you; he might provoke him, fight, be killed. Think, then, what\nyou would suffer in the presence of a father who should call on you to\nrender an account for the life of his son!\n\n\"Finally, my dear child, let me tell you all, for I have not yet\ntold you all, let me tell you what has brought me to Paris. I have a\ndaughter, as I have told you, young, beautiful, pure as an angel. She\nloves, and she, too, has made this love the dream of her life. I wrote\nall that to Armand, but, absorbed in you, he made no reply. Well, my\ndaughter is about to marry. She is to marry the man whom she loves; she\nenters an honourable family, which requires that mine has to be no less\nhonourable. The family of the man who is to become my son-in-law has\nlearned what manner of life Armand is leading in Paris, and has declared\nto me that the marriage must be broken off if Armand continues this\nlife. The future of a child who has done nothing against you, and who\nhas the right of looking forward to a happy future, is in your hands.\nHave you the right, have you the strength, to shatter it? In the name of\nyour love and of your repentance, Marguerite, grant me the happiness of\nmy child.\"\n\nI wept silently, my friend, at all these reflections which I had so\noften made, and which, in the mouth of your father, took a yet more\nserious reality. I said to myself all that your father dared not say to\nme, though it had come to his lips twenty times: that I was, after all,\nonly a kept woman, and that whatever excuse I gave for our liaison, it\nwould always look like calculation on my part; that my past life left\nme no right to dream of such a future, and that I was accepting\nresponsibilities for which my habits and reputation were far from giving\nany guarantee. In short, I loved you, Armand.\n\nThe paternal way in which M. Duval had spoken to me; the pure memories\nthat he awakened in me; the respect of this old man, which I would gain;\nyours, which I was sure of gaining later on: all that called up in my\nheart thoughts which raised me in my own eyes with a sort of holy pride,\nunknown till then. When I thought that one day this old man, who was now\nimploring me for the future of his son, would bid his daughter mingle my\nname with her prayers, as the name of a mysterious friend, I seemed to\nbecome transformed, and I felt a pride in myself.\n\nThe exaltation of the moment perhaps exaggerated the truth of these\nimpressions, but that was what I felt, friend, and these new feelings\nsilenced the memory of the happy days I had spent with you.\n\n\"Tell me, sir,\" I said to your father, wiping away my tears, \"do you\nbelieve that I love your son?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said M. Duval.\n\n\"With a disinterested love?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"Do you believe that I had made this love the hope, the dream, the\nforgiveness--of my life?\"\n\n\"Implicitly.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, embrace me once, as you would embrace your daughter, and I\nswear to you that that kiss, the only chaste kiss I have ever had, will\nmake me strong against my love, and that within a week your son will be\nonce more at your side, perhaps unhappy for a time, but cured forever.\"\n\n\"You are a noble child,\" replied your father, kissing me on the\nforehead, \"and you are making an attempt for which God will reward you;\nbut I greatly fear that you will have no influence upon my son.\"\n\n\"Oh, be at rest, sir; he will hate me.\"\n\nI had to set up between us, as much for me as for you, an insurmountable\nbarrier.\n\nI wrote to Prudence to say that I accepted the proposition of the Comte\nde N., and that she was to tell him that I would sup with her and him.\nI sealed the letter, and, without telling him what it contained, asked\nyour father to have it forwarded to its address on reaching Paris.\n\nHe inquired of me what it contained.\n\n\"Your son's welfare,\" I answered.\n\nYour father embraced me once more. I felt two grateful tears on my\nforehead, like the baptism of my past faults, and at the moment when I\nconsented to give myself up to another man I glowed with pride at the\nthought of what I was redeeming by this new fault.\n\nIt was quite natural, Armand. You told me that your father was the most\nhonest man in the world.\n\nM. Duval returned to his carriage, and set out for Paris.\n\nI was only a woman, and when I saw you again I could not help weeping,\nbut I did not give way.\n\nDid I do right? That is what I ask myself to-day, as I lie ill in my\nbed, that I shall never leave, perhaps, until I am dead.\n\nYou are witness of what I felt as the hour of our separation approached;\nyour father was no longer there to support me, and there was a moment\nwhen I was on the point of confessing everything to you, so terrified\nwas I at the idea that you were going to bate and despise me.\n\nOne thing which you will not believe, perhaps, Armand, is that I prayed\nGod to give me strength; and what proves that he accepted my sacrifice\nis that he gave me the strength for which I prayed.\n\nAt supper I still had need of aid, for I could not think of what I was\ngoing to do, so much did I fear that my courage would fail me. Who would\never have said that I, Marguerite Gautier, would have suffered so at the\nmere thought of a new lover? I drank for forgetfulness, and when I woke\nnext day I was beside the count.\n\nThat is the whole truth, friend. Judge me and pardon me, as I have\npardoned you for all the wrong that you have done me since that day.\n\n\n\nChapter 26\n\nWhat followed that fatal night you know as well as I; but what you can\nnot know, what you can not suspect, is what I have suffered since our\nseparation.\n\nI heard that your father had taken you away with him, but I felt sure\nthat you could not live away from me for long, and when I met you in the\nChamps-Elysees, I was a little upset, but by no means surprised.\n\nThen began that series of days; each of them brought me a fresh insult\nfrom you. I received them all with a kind of joy, for, besides proving\nto me that you still loved me, it seemed to me as if the more you\npersecuted me the more I should be raised in your eyes when you came to\nknow the truth.\n\nDo not wonder at my joy in martyrdom, Armand; your love for me had\nopened my heart to noble enthusiasm.\n\nStill, I was not so strong as that quite at once.\n\nBetween the time of the sacrifice made for you and the time of your\nreturn a long while elapsed, during which I was obliged to have recourse\nto physical means in order not to go mad, and in order to be blinded and\ndeafened in the whirl of life into which I flung myself. Prudence\nhas told you (has she not?) how I went to all the fetes and balls and\norgies. I had a sort of hope that I should kill myself by all these\nexcesses, and I think it will not be long before this hope is realized.\nMy health naturally got worse and worse, and when I sent Mme. Duvernoy\nto ask you for pity I was utterly worn out, body and soul.\n\nI will not remind you, Armand, of the return you made for the last proof\nof love that I gave you, and of the outrage by which you drove away a\ndying woman, who could not resist your voice when you asked her for a\nnight of love, and who, like a fool, thought for one instant that she\nmight again unite the past with the present. You had the right to do\nwhat you did, Armand; people have not always put so high a price on a\nnight of mine!\n\nI left everything after that. Olympe has taken my place with the Comte\nde N., and has told him, I hear, the reasons for my leaving him. The\nComte de G. was at London. He is one of those men who give just enough\nimportance to making love to women like me for it to be an agreeable\npastime, and who are thus able to remain friends with women, not hating\nthem because they have never been jealous of them, and he is, too, one\nof those grand seigneurs who open only a part of their hearts to us, but\nthe whole of their purses. It was of him that I immediately thought. I\njoined him in London. He received me as kindly as possible, but he\nwas the lover there of a woman in society, and he feared to compromise\nhimself if he were seen with me. He introduced me to his friends, who\ngave a supper in my honour, after which one of them took me home with\nhim.\n\nWhat else was there for me to do, my friend? If I had killed myself it\nwould have burdened your life, which ought to be happy, with a needless\nremorse; and then, what is the good of killing oneself when one is so\nnear dying already?\n\nI became a body without a soul, a thing without a thought; I lived for\nsome time in that automatic way; then I returned to Paris, and asked\nafter you; I heard then that you were gone on a long voyage. There was\nnothing left to hold me to life. My existence became what it had been\ntwo years before I knew you. I tried to win back the duke, but I had\noffended him too deeply. Old men are not patient, no doubt because they\nrealize that they are not eternal. I got weaker every day. I was pale\nand sad and thinner than ever. Men who buy love examine the goods before\ntaking them. At Paris there were women in better health, and not so thin\nas I was; I was rather forgotten. That is all the past up to yesterday.\n\nNow I am seriously ill. I have written to the duke to ask him for money,\nfor I have none, and the creditors have returned, and come to me with\ntheir bills with pitiless perseverance. Will the duke answer? Why are\nyou not in Paris, Armand? You would come and see me, and your visits\nwould do me good.\n\nDecember 20.\n\nThe weather is horrible; it is snowing, and I am alone. I have been in\nsuch a fever for the last three days that I could not write you a word.\nNo news, my friend; every day I hope vaguely for a letter from you, but\nit does not come, and no doubt it will never come. Only men are strong\nenough not to forgive. The duke has not answered.\n\nPrudence is pawning my things again.\n\nI have been spitting blood all the time. Oh, you would be sorry for me\nif you could see me. You are indeed happy to be under a warm sky, and\nnot, like me, with a whole winter of ice on your chest. To-day I got up\nfor a little while, and looked out through the curtains of my window,\nand watched the life of Paris passing below, the life with which I have\nnow nothing more to do. I saw the faces of some people I knew, passing\nrapidly, joyous and careless. Not one lifted his eyes to my window.\nHowever, a few young men have come to inquire for me. Once before I was\nill, and you, though you did not know me, though you had had nothing\nfrom me but an impertinence the day I met you first, you came to inquire\nafter me every day. We spent six months together. I had all the love for\nyou that a woman's heart can hold and give, and you are far away, you\nare cursing me, and there is not a word of consolation from you. But it\nis only chance that has made you leave me, I am sure, for if you were at\nParis, you would not leave my bedside.\n\nDecember 25.\n\nMy doctor tells me I must not write every day. And indeed my memories\nonly increase my fever, but yesterday I received a letter which did me\ngood, more because of what it said than by the material help which it\ncontained. I can write to you, then, to-day. This letter is from your\nfather, and this is what it says:\n\n\"MADAME: I have just learned that you are ill. If I were at Paris I\nwould come and ask after you myself; if my son were here I would send\nhim; but I can not leave C., and Armand is six or seven hundred leagues\nfrom here; permit me, then, simply to write to you, madame, to tell\nyou how pained I am to hear of your illness, and believe in my sincere\nwishes for your speedy recovery.\n\n\"One of my good friends, M. H., will call on you; will you kindly receive\nhim? I have intrusted him with a commission, the result of which I await\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Believe me, madame,\n\n\"Yours most faithfully.\"\n\n\nThis is the letter he sent me. Your father has a noble heart; love him\nwell, my friend, for there are few men so worthy of being loved.\nThis paper signed by his name has done me more good than all the\nprescriptions of our great doctor.\n\nThis morning M. H. called. He seemed much embarrassed by the delicate\nmission which M. Duval had intrusted to him. As a matter of fact, he\ncame to bring me three thousand francs from your father. I wanted to\nrefuse at first, but M. H. told me that my refusal would annoy M. Duval,\nwho had authorized him to give me this sum now, and later on whatever I\nmight need. I accepted it, for, coming from your father, it could not be\nexactly taking alms. If I am dead when you come back, show your father\nwhat I have written for him, and tell him that in writing these lines\nthe poor woman to whom he was kind enough to write so consoling a letter\nwept tears of gratitude and prayed God for him.\n\nJanuary 4.\n\nI have passed some terrible days. I never knew the body could suffer so.\nOh, my past life! I pay double for it now.\n\nThere has been someone to watch by me every night; I can not breathe.\nWhat remains of my poor existence is shared between being delirious and\ncoughing.\n\nThe dining-room is full of sweets and all sorts of presents that my\nfriends have brought. Some of them, I dare say, are hoping that I shall\nbe their mistress later on. If they could see what sickness has made of\nme, they would go away in terror.\n\nPrudence is giving her New Year's presents with those I have received.\n\nThere is a thaw, and the doctor says that I may go out in a few days if\nthe fine weather continues.\n\nJanuary 8.\n\nI went out yesterday in my carriage. The weather was lovely. The\nChamps-Elysees was full of people. It was like the first smile of\nspring. Everything about me had a festal air. I never knew before that a\nray of sunshine could contain so much joy, sweetness, and consolation.\n\nI met almost all the people I knew, all happy, all absorbed in their\npleasures. How many happy people don't even know that they are happy!\nOlympe passed me in an elegant carriage that M. de N. has given her. She\ntried to insult me by her look. She little knows how far I am from such\nthings now. A nice fellow, whom I have known for a long time, asked me\nif I would have supper with him and one of his friends, who, he said,\nwas very anxious to make my acquaintance. I smiled sadly and gave him my\nhand, burning with fever. I never saw such an astonished countenance.\n\nI came in at four, and had quite an appetite for my dinner. Going out\nhas done me good. If I were only going to get well! How the sight of the\nlife and happiness of others gives a desire of life to those who, only\nthe night before, in the solitude of their soul and in the shadow of\ntheir sick-room, only wanted to die soon!\n\nJanuary 10.\n\nThe hope of getting better was only a dream. I am back in bed again,\ncovered with plasters which burn me. If I were to offer the body that\npeople paid so dear for once, how much would they give, I wonder,\nto-day?\n\nWe must have done something very wicked before we were born, or else we\nmust be going to be very happy indeed when we are dead, for God to let\nthis life have all the tortures of expiation and all the sorrows of an\nordeal.\n\nJanuary 12.\n\nI am always ill.\n\nThe Comte de N. sent me some money yesterday. I did not keep it. I won't\ntake anything from that man. It is through him that you are not here.\n\nOh, that good time at Bougival! Where is it now?\n\nIf I come out of this room alive I will make a pilgrimage to the house\nwe lived in together, but I will never leave it until I am dead.\n\nWho knows if I shall write to you to-morrow?\n\nJanuary 25.\n\nI have not slept for eleven nights. I am suffocated. I imagine every\nmoment that I am going to die. The doctor has forbidden me to touch\na pen. Julie Duprat, who is looking after me, lets me write these\nfew lines to you. Will you not come back before I die? Is it all over\nbetween us forever? It seems to me as if I should get well if you came.\nWhat would be the good of getting well?\n\nJanuary 28.\n\nThis morning I was awakened by a great noise. Julie, who slept in\nmy room, ran into the dining-room. I heard men's voices, and hers\nprotesting against them in vain. She came back crying.\n\nThey had come to seize my things. I told her to let what they call\njustice have its way. The bailiff came into my room with his hat on. He\nopened the drawers, wrote down what he saw, and did not even seem to\nbe aware that there was a dying woman in the bed that fortunately the\ncharity of the law leaves me.\n\nHe said, indeed, before going, that I could appeal within nine days,\nbut he left a man behind to keep watch. My God! what is to become of me?\nThis scene has made me worse than I was before. Prudence wanted to go\nand ask your father's friend for money, but I would not let her.\n\nI received your letter this morning. I was in need of it. Will my answer\nreach you in time? Will you ever see me again? This is a happy day, and\nit has made me forget all the days I have passed for the last six weeks.\nI seem as if I am better, in spite of the feeling of sadness under the\nimpression of which I replied to you.\n\nAfter all, no one is unhappy always.\n\nWhen I think that it may happen to me not to die, for you to come back,\nfor me to see the spring again, for you still to love me, and for us to\nbegin over again our last year's life!\n\nFool that I am! I can scarcely hold the pen with which I write to you of\nthis wild dream of my heart.\n\nWhatever happens, I loved you well, Armand, and I would have died long\nago if I had not had the memory of your love to help me and a sort of\nvague hope of seeing you beside me again.\n\nFebruary 4.\n\nThe Comte de G. has returned. His mistress has been unfaithful to him.\nHe is very sad; he was very fond of her. He came to tell me all about\nit. The poor fellow is in rather a bad way as to money; all the same, he\nhas paid my bailiff and sent away the man.\n\nI talked to him about you, and he promised to tell you about me. I\nforgot that I had been his mistress, and he tried to make me forget it,\ntoo. He is a good friend.\n\nThe duke sent yesterday to inquire after me, and this morning he came\nto see me. I do not know how the old man still keeps alive. He remained\nwith me three hours and did not say twenty words. Two big tears fell\nfrom his eyes when he saw how pale I was. The memory of his daughter's\ndeath made him weep, no doubt. He will have seen her die twice. His back\nwas bowed, his head bent toward the ground, his lips drooping, his eyes\nvacant. Age and sorrow weigh with a double weight on his worn-out body.\nHe did not reproach me. It looked as if he rejoiced secretly to see the\nravages that disease had made in me. He seemed proud of being still on\nhis feet, while I, who am still young, was broken down by suffering.\n\nThe bad weather has returned. No one comes to see me. Julie watches by\nme as much as she can. Prudence, to whom I can no longer give as much as\nI used to, begins to make excuses for not coming.\n\nNow that I am so near death, in spite of what the doctors tell me, for\nI have several, which proves that I am getting worse, I am almost sorry\nthat I listened to your father; if I had known that I should only be\ntaking a year of your future, I could not have resisted the longing\nto spend that year with you, and, at least, I should have died with a\nfriend to hold my hand. It is true that if we had lived together this\nyear, I should not have died so soon.\n\nGod's will be done!\n\nFebruary 5.\n\nOh, come, come, Armand! I suffer horribly; I am going to die, O God!\nI was so miserable yesterday that I wanted to spend the evening, which\nseemed as if it were going to be as long as the last, anywhere but at\nhome. The duke came in the morning. It seems to me as if the sight of\nthis old man, whom death has forgotten, makes me die faster.\n\nDespite the burning fever which devoured me, I made them dress me and\ntake me to the Vaudeville. Julie put on some rouge for me, without which\nI should have looked like a corpse. I had the box where I gave you our\nfirst rendezvous. All the time I had my eyes fixed on the stall where\nyou sat that day, though a sort of country fellow sat there, laughing\nloudly at all the foolish things that the actors said. I was half dead\nwhen they brought me home. I coughed and spat blood all the night.\nTo-day I can not speak, I can scarcely move my arm. My God! My God! I\nam going to die! I have been expecting it, but I can not get used to the\nthought of suffering more than I suffer now, and if--\n\nAfter this the few characters traced by Marguerite were indecipherable,\nand what followed was written by Julie Duprat.\n\nFebruary 18.\n\nMONSIEUR ARMAND:\n\nSince the day that Marguerite insisted on going to the theatre she has\ngot worse and worse. She has completely lost her voice, and now the use\nof her limbs.\n\nWhat our poor friend suffers is impossible to say. I am not used to\nemotions of this kind, and I am in a state of constant fright.\n\nHow I wish you were here! She is almost always delirious; but delirious\nor lucid, it is always your name that she pronounces, when she can speak\na word.\n\nThe doctor tells me that she is not here for long. Since she got so ill\nthe old duke has not returned. He told the doctor that the sight was too\nmuch for him.\n\nMme. Duvernoy is not behaving well. This woman, who thought she could\nget more money out of Marguerite, at whose expense she was living almost\ncompletely, has contracted liabilities which she can not meet, and\nseeing that her neighbour is no longer of use to her, she does not even\ncome to see her. Everybody is abandoning her. M. de G., prosecuted for\nhis debts, has had to return to London. On leaving, he sent us more\nmoney; he has done all he could, but they have returned to seize the\nthings, and the creditors are only waiting for her to die in order to\nsell everything.\n\nI wanted to use my last resources to put a stop to it, but the bailiff\ntold me it was no use, and that there are other seizures to follow.\nSince she must die, it is better to let everything go than to save it\nfor her family, whom she has never cared to see, and who have never\ncared for her. You can not conceive in the midst of what gilded misery\nthe poor thing is dying. Yesterday we had absolutely no money. Plate,\njewels, shawls, everything is in pawn; the rest is sold or seized.\nMarguerite is still conscious of what goes on around her, and she\nsuffers in body, mind, and heart. Big tears trickle down her cheeks, so\nthin and pale that you would never recognise the face of her whom you\nloved so much, if you could see her. She has made me promise to write to\nyou when she can no longer write, and I write before her. She turns her\neyes toward me, but she no longer sees me; her eyes are already veiled\nby the coming of death; yet she smiles, and all her thoughts, all her\nsoul are yours, I am sure.\n\nEvery time the door opens her eyes brighten, and she thinks you are\ngoing to come in; then, when she sees that it is not you, her face\nresumes its sorrowful expression, a cold sweat breaks out over it, and\nher cheek-bones flush.\n\nFebruary 19, midnight.\n\nWhat a sad day we have had to-day, poor M. Armand! This morning\nMarguerite was stifling; the doctor bled her, and her voice has returned\nto her a while. The doctor begged her to see a priest. She said \"Yes,\"\nand he went himself to fetch an abbe' from Saint Roch.\n\nMeanwhile Marguerite called me up to her bed, asked me to open a\ncupboard, and pointed out a cap and a long chemise covered with lace,\nand said in a feeble voice:\n\n\"I shall die as soon as I have confessed. Then you will dress me in\nthese things; it is the whim of a dying woman.\"\n\nThen she embraced me with tears and added:\n\n\"I can speak, but I am stifled when I speak; I am stifling. Air!\"\n\nI burst into tears, opened the window, and a few minutes afterward the\npriest entered. I went up to him; when he knew where he was, he seemed\nafraid of being badly received.\n\n\"Come in boldly, father,\" I said to him.\n\nHe stayed a very short time in the room, and when he came out he said to\nme:\n\n\"She lived a sinner, and she will die a Christian.\"\n\nA few minutes afterward he returned with a choir boy bearing a crucifix,\nand a sacristan who went before them ringing the bell to announce that\nGod was coming to the dying one.\n\nThey went all three into the bed-room where so many strange words have\nbeen said, but was now a sort of holy tabernacle.\n\nI fell on my knees. I do not know how long the impression of what I saw\nwill last, but I do not think that, till my turn comes, any human thing\ncan make so deep an impression on me.\n\nThe priest anointed with holy oil the feet and hands and forehead of the\ndying woman, repeated a short prayer, and Marguerite was ready to set\nout for the heaven to which I doubt not she will go, if God has seen the\nordeal of her life and the sanctity of her death.\n\nSince then she has not said a word or made a movement. Twenty times I\nshould have thought her dead if I had not heard her breathing painfully.\n\nFebruary 20, 5 P.M.\n\nAll is over.\n\nMarguerite fell into her last agony at about two o'clock. Never did a\nmartyr suffer such torture, to judge by the cries she uttered. Two or\nthree times she sat upright in the bed, as if she would hold on to her\nlife, which was escaping toward God.\n\nTwo or three times also she said your name; then all was silent, and she\nfell back on the bed exhausted. Silent tears flowed from her eyes, and\nshe was dead.\n\nThen I went up to her; I called her, and as she did not answer I closed\nher eyes and kissed her on the forehead.\n\nPoor, dear Marguerite, I wish I were a holy woman that my kiss might\nrecommend you to God.\n\nThen I dressed her as she had asked me to do. I went to find a priest at\nSaint Roch, I burned two candles for her, and I prayed in the church for\nan hour.\n\nI gave the money she left to the poor.\n\nI do not know much about religion, but I think that God will know that\nmy tears were genuine, my prayers fervent, my alms-giving sincere, and\nthat he will have pity on her who, dying young and beautiful, has only\nhad me to close her eyes and put her in her shroud.\n\nFebruary 22.\n\nThe burial took place to-day. Many of Marguerite's friends came to the\nchurch. Some of them wept with sincerity. When the funeral started on\nthe way to Montmartre only two men followed it: the Comte de G., who\ncame from London on purpose, and the duke, who was supported by two\nfootmen.\n\nI write you these details from her house, in the midst of my tears and\nunder the lamp which burns sadly beside a dinner which I can not touch,\nas you can imagine, but which Nanine has got for me, for I have eaten\nnothing for twenty-four hours.\n\nMy life can not retain these sad impressions for long, for my life is\nnot my own any more than Marguerite's was hers; that is why I give you\nall these details on the very spot where they occurred, in the fear, if\na long time elapsed between them and your return, that I might not be\nable to give them to you with all their melancholy exactitude.\n\n\n\nChapter 27\n\n\"You have read it?\" said Armand, when I had finished the manuscript.\n\n\"I understand what you must have suffered, my friend, if all that I read\nis true.\"\n\n\"My father confirmed it in a letter.\"\n\nWe talked for some time over the sad destiny which had been\naccomplished, and I went home to rest a little.\n\nArmand, still sad, but a little relieved by the narration of his story,\nsoon recovered, and we went together to pay a visit to Prudence and to\nJulie Duprat.\n\nPrudence had become bankrupt. She told us that Marguerite was the cause\nof it; that during her illness she had lent her a lot of money in the\nform of promissory notes, which she could not pay, Marguerite having\ndied without having returned her the money, and without having given her\na receipt with which she could present herself as a creditor.\n\nBy the help of this fable, which Mme. Duvernoy repeated everywhere in\norder to account for her money difficulties, she extracted a note for a\nthousand francs from Armand, who did not believe it, but who pretended\nto, out of respect for all those in whose company Marguerite had lived.\n\nThen we called on Julie Duprat, who told us the sad incident which she\nhad witnessed, shedding real tears at the remembrance of her friend.\n\nLastly, we went to Marguerite's grave, on which the first rays of the\nApril sun were bringing the first leaves into bud.\n\nOne duty remained to Armand--to return to his father. He wished me to\naccompany him.\n\nWe arrived at C., where I saw M. Duval, such as I had imagined him from\nthe portrait his son had made of him, tall, dignified, kindly.\n\nHe welcomed Armand with tears of joy, and clasped my hand\naffectionately. I was not long in seeing that the paternal sentiment was\nthat which dominated all others in his mind.\n\nHis daughter, named Blanche, had that transparence of eyes, that\nserenity of the mouth, which indicates a soul that conceives only\nholy thoughts and lips that repeat only pious words. She welcomed her\nbrother's return with smiles, not knowing, in the purity of her youth,\nthat far away a courtesan had sacrificed her own happiness at the mere\ninvocation of her name.\n\nI remained for some time in their happy family, full of indulgent care\nfor one who brought them the convalescence of his heart.\n\nI returned to Paris, where I wrote this story just as it had been told\nme. It has only one merit, which will perhaps be denied it; that is,\nthat it is true.\n\nI do not draw from this story the conclusion that all women like\nMarguerite are capable of doing all that she did--far from it; but\nI have discovered that one of them experienced a serious love in the\ncourse of her life, that she suffered for it, and that she died of it. I\nhave told the reader all that I learned. It was my duty.\n\nI am not the apostle of vice, but I would gladly be the echo of noble\nsorrow wherever I bear its voice in prayer.\n\nThe story of Marguerite is an exception, I repeat; had it not been an\nexception, it would not have been worth the trouble of writing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Camille (La Dame aux Camilias), by\nAlexandre Dumas, fils\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CAMILLE (LA DAME AUX CAMILIAS) ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1608.txt or 1608.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/6\/0\/1608\/\n\nProduced by Dianne Bean\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":432,"split":"train"}
