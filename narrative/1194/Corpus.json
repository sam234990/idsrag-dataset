{"ori_id":"39c4fffc8734283d7bd491285d24b55a110c71ba","title":"Agatha Christie","context":"Agatha Christie\n Christie's reputation as \"The Queen of Crime\" was built upon the large number of classic motifs that she introduced, or for which she provided the most famous example. Christie built these tropes into what is now considered classic mystery structure: a murder is committed, there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets, and the detective gradually uncovers these secrets over the course of the story, discovering the most shocking twists towards the end. Culprits in Christie's mysteries have included children, policemen, narrators, already deceased individuals, and sometimes comprise no known suspects (And Then There Were None) or all of the suspects (Murder on the Orient Express).\nAt the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of his deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as And Then There Were None and Endless Night, both rather nihilistic in nature).\nChristie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons, such as the passage of time (retrospective cases), in which the most important characters have already died, or by active prescription. Such cases include The Witness for the Prosecution, Murder on the Orient Express, The Man in the Brown Suit, Elephants Can Remember, and The Unexpected Guest. There are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of his plot, sometimes by his own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective (usually Hercule Poirot). This occurs in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Death on the Nile, Dumb Witness, Crooked House, The Hollow, The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, Cat Among the Pigeons, Peril at End House, Nemesis, Appointment with Death, The Secret Adversary, and Curtain. In the last of these (Curtain), no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story.\nIn The A.B.C. Murders, the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes. Hercule Poirot, however, prevents this easy way out, ensuring a trial and hanging. In And Then There Were None, the killer's own death is intrinsic to the plot; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died. However, stage, film, and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in film and television productions, most famously the Charles Laughton\/Marlene Dietrich film.) In Death Comes as the End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed in the act before he can claim another victim by one of the few surviving characters.\nIn some stories, the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as Five Little Pigs and Endless Night. According to P. D. James, Christie often, but not always, made the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect.\nOn an edition of Desert Island Discs in 2007, Brian Aldiss claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person. However, John Curran's Agatha Christie: The Secret Notebooks describes different working methods for every book in Christie's bibliography, contradicting the claim by Aldiss.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Agatha's Husband, by \nDinah Maria Craik (AKA: Dinah Maria Mulock)\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

She was good, in the first place--right good at heart, though\nwith a slight external roughness (like the sound of the g in her name),\nwhich took away all sentimentalism. Then the vowels--the three broad\nrich a's--which no one can pronounce with nimini-pimini closed lips--how\nthoroughly they answered to her character!--a character in the which was\nnothing small, mean, cramped, or crooked.\n\nBut if we go on unfolding her in this way, there will not be the\nslightest use in writing her history, or that of one in whom her life is\nbeautifully involved and enclosed--as every married woman's should be--\n\nHe was still in clouded mystery--an individual yet to be; and two other\nindividuals had been \"talking him over,\" feminine-fashion, in Miss\nAgatha Bowen's drawing-room, much to that lady's amusement and\nedification. For, being moderately rich, she had her own suite of rooms\nin the house where she boarded; and having no mother--sorrowful lot for\na girl of nineteen!--she sometimes filled her drawing-room with very\nuseless and unprofitable acquaintances. These two married ladies--one\nyoung, the other old--Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Thornycroft--had been for the\nlast half-hour vexing their very hearts out to find Agatha a husband--a\nweakness which, it must be confessed, lurks in the heart of almost every\nmarried lady.\n\nAgatha had been laughing at it, alternately flushing up or looking\nscornful, as her mouth had a natural propensity for looking; balancing\nherself occasionally on the arm of the sofa, which, being rather small\nand of a light figure, she could do with both impunity and grace; or\nelse rushing to the open window, ostensibly to let her black kitten\ninvestigate street-sights from its mistress's shoulder. Agatha was very\nmuch of a child still, or could be when she chose.\n\nMrs. Hill had been regretting some two or three \"excellent matches\" of\nwhich she felt sure Miss Bowen had thrown away her chance; and young\nMrs. Thornycroft had tried hard to persuade her dearest Agatha how very\nmuch happier she would be in a house of her own, than as a boarder even\nin this excellent physician's family. But Agatha only laughed on, and\ndevoted herself more than ever to the black kitten.\n\nShe was, I fear, a damsel who rather neglected the _biens\u00c3\u00a9ances_ of\nlife. Only, in her excuse, it must be allowed that her friends were\ndoing what they had no earthly business to do; since; if there is one\nsubject above all upon which a young woman has a right to keep her\nthoughts, feelings, and intentions to herself, and to exact from others\nthe respect of silence, it is that of marriage. Possibly, Agatha Bowen\nwas of this opinion.\n\n\"Mrs. Hill, you are a very kind, good soul: and Emma Thornycroft, I like\nyou very much; but if--(Oh! be quiet, Tittens!)--if you could manage to\nlet me and 'my Husband' alone.\"\n\nThese were the only serious words she said--and they were but half\nserious; she evidently felt such an irresistible propensity to laugh.\n\n\"Now,\" continued she, turning the conversation, and putting on a\ndignified aspect, which occasionally she took it into her head to\nassume, though more in playfulness than earnest--\"now let me tell you\nwho you will meet here at dinner to-day.\"\n\n\"Major Harper, of course.\"\n\n\"I do not see the 'of course' Mrs. Thornycroft,\" returned Agatha,\nrather sharply; then, melting into a smile, she added: \"Well, 'of\ncourse,' as you say; what more likely visitor could I have than my\nguardian?\"\n\n\"Trustee, my dear; guardians belong to romances, where young ladies are\nalways expected to hate, or fall in love with them.\"\n\nAgatha flushed slightly. Now, unlike most girls, Miss Bowen did not look\npretty when she blushed; her skin being very dark, and not over clear,\nthe red blood coursing under it dyed her cheek, not \"celestial, rosy\nred,\" but a warm mahogany colour. Perhaps a consciousness of this\ndeepened the unpleasant blushing fit, to which, like most sensitive\npeople at her age, she was always rather prone.\n\n\"Not,\" continued Mrs. Thornycroft, watching her,--\"not that I think any\nlove affair is likely to happen in your case; Major Harper is far too\nmuch of a settled-down bachelor, and at the same time too old.\"\n\nAgatha pulled a comical face, and made a few solemn allusions to\nMethuselah. She had a peculiarly quick, even abrupt manner of speaking,\nsaying a dozen words in the time most young ladies would take to drawl\nout three; and possessing, likewise, the rare feminine quality of never\nsaying a word more than was necessary.\n\n\"Agatha, how funny you are!\" laughed her easily-amused friend. \"But,\ndear, tell me who else is coming?\" And she glanced doubtfully down on a\ngown that looked like a marriage-silk \"dyed and renovated.\"\n\n\"Oh, no ladies--and gentlemen never see whether one is dressed in\nbrocade or sackcloth,\" returned Agatha, rather maliciously;--\"only,\n'old Major Harper' as you are pleased to call him, and\"----\n\n\"Nay, I didn't call him very old--just forty, or thereabouts--though he\ndoes not look anything like it. Then he is so handsome, and, I must say,\nAgatha, pays you such extreme attention.\"\n\nAgatha laughed again--the quick, light-hearted laugh of nineteen--and\nher brown eyes brightened with innocent pleasure.\n\nYoung Mrs. Thornycroft again looked down uneasily at her dress--not from\novermuch vanity, but because her hounded mind recurred instinctively\nfrom extraneous or large interests to individual and lesser ones.\n\n\"Is there really any one particular coming, my dear? Of course, _you_\nhave no trouble about evening dress; mourning is such easy comfortable\nwear.\" (Agatha turned her head quickly aside.) \"That handsome silk\nof yours looks quite well still; and mamma there,\" glancing at the\ncontentedly knitting Mrs. Hill--\"old ladies never require much dress;\nbut if you had only told me to prepare for company\"----\n\n\"Pretty company! Merely our own circle--Dr. Ianson, Mrs. Ianson, and\nMiss Ianson--you need not mind outshining her now\"----\n\n\"No, indeed! I am married.\"\n\n\"Then the 'company' dwindles down to two besides yourselves; Major\nHarper and his brother.\"\n\n\"Oh! What sort of a person is the brother?\"\n\n\"I really don't know; I have never seen him. He is just come home from\nCanada; the youngest of the family--and I hate boys,\" replied Agatha,\nrunning the sentences one upon the other in her quick fashion.\n\n\"The youngest of the family--how many are there in all?\" inquired the\nelder lady, her friendly anxiety being probably once more on matrimonial\nthoughts intent.\n\n\"I am sure, Mrs. Hill, I cannot tell. I have never seen any of them but\nMajor Harper, and I never saw him till my poor father died; all which\ncircumstances you know quite well, and Emma too; so there is no need to\ntalk a thing twice over.\"\n\nFrom her occasional mode of speech, some people might say, and did say,\nthat Agatha Bowen \"had a temper of her own.\" It is very true, she was\nnot one of those mild, amiable heroines who never can give a sharp word\nto any one. And now and then, probably from the morbid restlessness\nof unsatisfied youth--a youth, too, that fate had deprived of those\nhome-ties, duties, and sacrifices, which are at once so arduous and so\nwholesome--she had a habit of carrying, not only the real black kitten,\nbut the imaginary and allegorical \"little black dog,\" on her shoulder.\n\nIt was grinning there invisibly now; shaking her curls with short\nquick motion, swelling her rich full lips--those sort of lips which are\nglorious in smiles, but which in repose are apt to settle into a gravity\nnot unlike crossness.\n\nShe was looking thus--not her best, it must be allowed--when a servant,\nopening the drawing-room door, announced \"Visitors for Miss Bowen.\"\n\nThe first who entered, very much in advance of the other, appeared with\nthat easy, agreeable air which at once marks the gentleman, and one long\naccustomed to the world in all its phases, especially to the feminine\nphase; for he bowed over Agatha's hand, and smiled in Agatha's now\nbrightening face, with a sort of tender manliness, that implied his\nbeing used to pleasing women, and having an agreeable though not an\nungenerous consciousness of the fact.\n\n\"Are you better--really better? Are you quite sure you have no cold\nleft? Nothing to make your friends anxious about you?\" (Agatha shook her\nhead smilingly.) \"That's right; I am so glad.\"\n\nAnd no doubt Major Harper was; for a true kind-heartedness, softened\neven to tender-heartedness, was visible in his handsome face. Which face\nhad been for twenty years the admiration of nearly every woman in every\ndrawing-room he entered: a considerable trial for any man. Now and then\nsome independent young lady, who had reasons of her own for preferring\nrosy complexions, turn-up noses, and \"runaway\" chins, might quarrel\nwith the Major's fine Roman profile and jet-black moustache and hair;\nbut--there was no denying it--he was, even at forty, a remarkably\nhandsome man; one of the old school of Chesterfield perfection, which is\nfast dying out.\n\nEverybody liked him, more or less; and some people--a few men and not a\nfew women, had either in friendship or in warmer fashion--deeply\nloved him. Society in general was quite aware of this; nor, it must be\nconfessed, did Major Harper at all attempt to disprove or ignore the\nfact. He wore his honours--as he did a cross won, no one quite knew\nhow, during a brief service in the Peninsula--neither pompously nor\nboastingly, but with the mild indifference of conscious desert.\n\nAll this could be at once discerned in his face, voice, and manner;\nfrom which likewise a keen observer might draw the safe conclusion that,\nthough a decided man of fashion, and something of a dandy, he was above\neither puppyism or immorality. And Agatha's rich Anglo-Indian father had\nnot judged foolishly when he put his only child and her property in the\ntrust of, as he believed, that rare personage, an honest man.\n\nIf the girl Agatha, who took honesty as a matter of course in every\ngentleman, endowed this particular one with a few qualities more than he\nreally possessed, it was an amiable weakness on her part, for which,\nas Major Harper would doubtless have said with a seriously troubled\ncountenance, \"no one could possibly blame _him._\"\n\nIn speaking of the Major we have taken little notice--as little, indeed,\nas Agatha did--of the younger Mr. Harper.\n\n\"My brother, Miss Bowen. He came home when my sister Emily died.\" The\nbrief introduction terminated in a slight fall of voice, which made the\nyoung lady look sympathisingly at the handsome face that took shades of\nsadness as easily as shades of mirth. In her interest for the Major she\nmerely bowed to his brother; just noticed that the stranger was a tall,\nfair \"boy,\" not at all resembling her own friend; and after a polite\nspeech or two of welcome, to which Mr. Harper answered very briefly,\nshe hardly looked at him again until she and her guests adjourned to the\nfamily drawing-room of Dr. Ianson.\n\nThere, the Major happening to be engrossed by doing earnest politeness\nto Mrs. Thornycroft and her mother, Agatha had to enter side by side\nwith the younger brother, and likewise to introduce him to the worthy\nfamily whose inmate she was.\n\nShe did so, making the whole circuit of the room towards Miss Jane\nIanson, in the hope that he would cast anchor, or else be grappled by\nthat young lady, and so she should get rid of him. However, fate was\nadverse; the young gentleman showed no inclination to be thus put aside,\nand Miss Bowen, driven to despair, was just going to extinguish him\naltogether with some specimen of the unceremonious manner which she\noccasionally showed to \"boys,\" when, observing him more closely, she\ndiscovered that he could not exactly come under this category.\n\nHis fair face, fair hair, and thin, stripling-like figure, had deceived\nher. Investigating deeper, there was a something in his grave eye\nand firmly-set mouth which bespoke the man, not the boy. Agatha, who,\ntreating him with a careless womanly superiority that girls of nineteen\nuse, had asked \"how long he had been in Canada?\" and been answered\n\"Fifteen years,\"--hesitated at her next intended question--the very rude\nand malicious one--\"How old he was when he left home?\"\n\n\"I was, as you say, very young when I quitted England,\" he answered, to\na less pointed remark of Miss Ianson's. \"I must have been a lad of nine\nor ten--little more.\"\n\nAgatha quite started to think of the disrespectful way in which she\nhad treated a gentleman twenty-five years old! It made her shy and\nuncomfortable for some minutes, and she rather repented of her habit of\npatronising \"boys.\"\n\nHowever, what was even twenty-five? A raw, uncouth age. No man was\nreally good for anything until he was thirty. And, as quickly as\ncourtesy and good feeling allowed her, she glided from the uninteresting\nyounger brother to the charmed circle where the elder was talking away,\nas only Major Harper could talk, using all the weapons of conversation\nby turns, to a degree that never can be truly described. Like Taglioni's\n_entrechats_, or Grisi's melodious notes, such extrinsic talent dies on\nthe senses of the listener, who cannot prove, scarcely even explain, but\nonly say that it was so. Nevertheless, with all his power of amusing, a\nkeen observer might have discerned in Major Harper a want of depth--of\nreading--of thought; a something that marked out the man of society\nin contradiction to the man of intellect or of letters. Had he been an\nauthor--which he was once heard to thank Heaven he was not--he would\nprobably have been one of those shallow, fashionable sentimentalists\nwho hang like Mahomed's coffin between earth and heaven, an eyesore unto\nboth. As it was, his modicum of talent made him a most pleasant man in\nhis own sphere--the drawing-room.\n\n\"Really,\" whispered the good, corpulent Dr. Ianson, who had been\nlaughing so much that he quite forgot dinner was behind time, \"my dear\nMiss Bowen, your friend is the most amusing, witty, delightful person.\nIt is quite a pleasure to have such a man at one's table.\"\n\n\"Quite a pleasure, indeed,\" echoed Mrs. Ianson, deeply thankful to\nanything or anybody that stood in the breach between herself, her\nhusband, and the dilatory cook.\n\nAgatha looked gratified and proud. Casting a shy glance towards where\nher friend was talking to Emma Thomycroft and Miss Ianson, she met\nthe eye of the younger brother. It expressed such keen, though\ngrave observance of her, that she felt her cheeks warm into the old,\nunbecoming, uncomfortable blush.\n\nIt was rather a satisfaction that, just then, they were summoned\nto dinner; Major Harper, in his half tender, half paternal manner,\nadvancing to take her downstairs; which was his custom, when, as\nfrequently happened, Agatha Bowen was the woman he liked best in the\nroom. This was indeed his usual way in all societies, except when out of\nkindliness of heart he now and then made a temporary sacrifice in favour\nof some woman who he thought liked _him_ best. Though even in this case,\nperhaps, he would not have erred, or felt that he erred, in offering his\narm to Agatha.\n\nShe looked happy, as any young girl would, in receiving the attentions\nof a man whom all admired; and was quite contented to sit next to him,\nlistening while he talked cheerfully and brilliantly, less for her\npersonal, entertainment than that of the table in general. Which she\nthought, considering the dulness of the Ianson circle, and that even her\nown kind-hearted, long-known friend, Emma Thomycroft, was not the most\nintellectual woman in the world,--showed great good nature on the part\nof Major Harper.\n\nPerhaps the most silent person at table was the younger brother, whose\nChristian name Agatha did not know. However, hearing the Major call\nhim once or twice by an odd-sounding word, something like \"Beynell\" or\n\"Ennell,\" she had the curiosity to inquire.\n\n\"Oh, it is N. L.--his initials; which I call him by, instead of the\nvery ugly name his cruel godfathers and godmothers imposed upon him as a\nlife-long martyrdom.\"\n\n\"What name is that?\" asked Agatha, looking across at the luckless victim\nof nomenclature, who seemed to endure his woes with great equanimity.\n\nHe met her eye, and answered for himself, showing he had been listening\nto her all the time. \"I am called Nathanael--it is an old family\nname--Nathanael Locke Harper.\"\n\n\"You don't look very like a Nathanael,\" observed his neighbour, Mrs.\nThornycroft, doubtless wishing to be complimentary.\n\n\"I think he does,\" said Agatha, kindly, for she was struck by the\ninfinitely sweet and \"good\" expression which the young man's face just\nthen wore. \"He looks like the Nathanael of Scripture, 'in whom there\nwas no guile.'\"\n\nA pause--for the Iansons were those sort of religious people who think\nany Biblical allusions irreverent. But Major Harper said, heartily,\n\"That's true!\" and cordially, nay affectionately, pressed Agatha's\nhand. Nathanael slightly coloured, as if with pleasure, though he made\nno answer of any kind. He was evidently unused to bandy either jests or\ncompliments.\n\nIf anything could be objected to in a young man so retiring and\nunobtrusive as he, it was a certain something the very opposite of\nhis brother's cheerful frankness. His features, regular, delicate, and\nperfectly colourless; his hair long, straight, and of the palest brown,\nwithout any shadow of what painters would call a \"warm tint,\" auburn or\ngold, running through it; his slow, quiet movements, rare speech, and a\ncertain passive composure of aspect, altogether conveyed the impression\nof a nature which, if not positively repellant, was decidedly cold.\n\nAgatha felt it, and though from the rule of opposites, this species of\ncharacter awoke in her a spice of interest, yet was the interest of too\nfaint and negative a kind to attract her more than momentarily.\n\nIn her own mind she set down Nathanael Harper as \"a very odd sort of\nyouth\"--(_a youth_ she still persisted in calling him)--and turned\nagain to his brother.\n\nThey had dined late,--and the brief evening bade fair to pass as\nafter-dinner evenings do. Arrived in the drawing-room, old Mrs. Hill\nwent to sleep; Miss Ianson, a pale young woman, in delicate health,\ndisappeared; Mrs. Ianson and Mrs. Thornycroft commenced a low-toned,\nharmless conversation, which was probably about \"servants\" and \"babies.\"\nAgatha being at that age when domestic affairs are very uninteresting,\nand girlish romance has not yet ripened into the sweet and solemn\ninstincts of motherhood, stole quietly aside, and did the very rude\nthing of taking up a book and beginning to read \"in company.\" But, as\nbefore stated, Miss Agatha had a will of her own, which she usually\nfollowed out, even when it ran a little contrary to the ultra-refined\nlaws of propriety.\n\nThe book not being sufficiently interesting, she was beginning, like\nmany another clever girl of nineteen, to think the society of married\nladies a great bore, and to wonder when the gentlemen would come\nup-stairs'. Her wish was shortly gratified by the door's opening--but\nonly to admit the \"youth\" Nathanael.\n\nHowever, partly for civility, and partly through lack of entertainment,\nAgatha smiled upon even him, and tried to make him talk.\n\nThis was not an easy matter, since in all qualities he seemed to be\nhis elder brother's opposite. Indeed, his reserve and brevity of speech\nemulated Agatha's own; so they got on together ill enough, until by some\nhappy chance they lighted on the subject of Canada and the Backwoods.\nWhere is there boy or girl of romantic imagination who did not, at\nsome juvenile period of existence, revel in descriptions of American\nforest-life? Agatha had scarcely passed this, the latest of her various\nmanias; and on the strength of it, she and Mr. Harper became more\nsociable. She even condescended to declare \"that it was a pleasure to\nmeet with one who had absolutely seen, nay, lived among red Indians.'\"\n\n\"Ay, and nearly died among them too,\" added Major Harper, coming up so\nunexpectedly that Agatha had not noticed him. \"Tell Miss Bowen how you\nwere captured, tied to the stake, half-tomahawked, etc.--how you lived\nIndian fashion for a whole year, when you were sixteen. Wonderful lad! A\nsecond Nathaniel Bumppo!\" added he, tapping his brother's shoulder.\n\nThe young man drew back, merely answered \"that the story would not\ninterest Miss Bowen,\" and retired, whether out of pride or shyness it\nwas impossible to say.\n\nThe conversation, taken up and led, as usual, by Major Harper, became\na general disquisition on the race of North American Indians.\nAccidentally, or not, the elder brother drew from the younger many\nfacts, indicating a degree of both information and experience which\nmade every one glance with surprise, respect, and a little awe, on the\ndelicate, boyish-looking Nathanael.\n\nOnce, too, Agatha took her turn as an object of interest to the rest\nThey were all talking of the distinctive personal features of that\nstrange race, which some writers have held to be the ten lost tribes of\nIsrael. Agatha asked what were the characteristics of an Indian face,\noften stated to be so fine?\n\n\"Look in the mirror, Miss Bowen,\" said Nathanael, joining in the\nconversation.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI mean, that were you not an Englishwoman, I should have thought you\ndescended from a Pawnee Indian--all except the hair. The features are\nexact--long, almond-shaped eyes, aquiline nose, mouth and chin of the\nrare classic mould, which these children of nature keep, long after it\nhas almost vanished out of civilised Europe. Then your complexion, of\nsuch a dark ruddy brown--your\"----\n\n\"Stop--stop!\" cried the Major, heartily laughing. \"Miss Bowen will think\nyou have learnt every one of her physical peculiarities off by\nheart already. I had not the least idea you were gifted with so much\nobservation.\"\n\n\"Nay, do let him go on; it amuses me,\" cried the young girl, laughing,\nthough she could not help blushing a' little also.\n\nBut Nathanael had \"shrunk into his shell,\" as his brother humorously\nwhispered to Agatha, and was not to be drawn out for the remainder of\nthe evening.\n\nThe Harpers left early, thus affording great opportunity for their\ncharacters being discussed afterwards. Every lady in the room had long\nsince declared herself \"in love\" with the elder brother; the fact was\nnow repeated for the thousandth time, together with one or two remarks\nabout the younger Harper, who they agreed was rather nice-looking, but\nso eccentric!\n\nMiss Bowen scarcely thought about Nathanael at all; except that, after\nshe was in bed, a comical recollection floated through other more\nserious ones, and she laughed outright at the notion of being considered\nlike a Pawnee Indian!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nOf all the misfortunes incidental to youth (falling in love included),\nthere are few greater than that of having nothing to do. From this\ntrial, Agatha Bowen, being unhappily a young lady of independent\nproperty, suffered martyrdom every day. She had no natural ties, duties,\nor interests, and was not sufficiently selfish to create the like in and\nabout her own personality. She did not think herself handsome enough to\nbe vain, so had not that sweet refuge of feminine idleness--dress. Nor,\nit must be dolefully confessed, was she of so loving a nature as to love\nanybody or everybody, as some women can.\n\nKind to all, and liking many, she was apparently one of those characters\nwho only really _love_ two or three people in the whole course of their\nexistence. To such, life is a serious, perilous, and often terrible\njourney.\n\n\"Well, Tittens, I don't know, really, what we are to do with ourselves\nthis morning,\" said Agatha, talking aloud to her Familiar, the black\nkitten, who shared the solitude of her little drawing-room. \"You'd like\nto go and play downstairs, I dare say? It's all very nice for you to be\nrunning after Mrs. Ianson's wools, but I can't see anything amusing in\nfancy-work. And as for dawdling round this square and Russell Square\nwith Jane Ianson and Fido--pah! I'd quite as soon be changed into a\nlapdog, and led along by a string. How stupid London is! Oh, Tittens,\nto think that you and I have never lived in the country since we were\nborn. Wouldn't you like to go? Only, then we should never see\nanybody\"----\n\nThe foolish girl paused, and laughed, as if she did not like to\nsoliloquise too confidentially, even to a kitten.\n\n\"Which of them did you like the best last night, Tittens? One was not\nover civil to you; but Nathanael--yes, certainly you and that juvenile\nare great friends, considering you have met but four evenings. All in\none week, too. Our house is getting quite gay, Miss Tittens; only it is\nso much the duller in the mornings. Heigho!\n\n\"Life's a weary, weary, weary, Life's a weary coble o' care.\"\n\n\"What's the other verse? And she began humming:\n\n\"Man's a steerer, steerer, steerer, Man's a steerer--life is a pool.\"\n\n\"I wonder, Tittens, how you and I shall steer through it? and whether\nthe pool will be muddy or clear?\"\n\nTwisting her fingers in and about her pet's jetty for, Agatha sat\nsilent, until slowly there grew a thoughtful shadow in her eyes, a\nforewarning of the gradual passing away of that childishness, which in\nher, from accidental circumstances, had lasted strangely long.\n\n\"Come, we won't be foolish, Tittens,\" cried she, suddenly starting up.\n\"We'll put on our bonnets, and go out--that is, one of us will, and the\nother may take to Berlin wool and Mrs. Ianson.\"\n\nThe bonnet was popped on quickly and independently--Miss Bowen scorned\nto indulge in the convenience or annoyance of a lady's-maid. Crossing\nthe hall, the customary question, \"Whether she would be home to dinner?\"\nstopped her.\n\n\"I don't know--I am not quite sure. Tell Mrs. Ianson not to wait for\nme.\"\n\nAnd she passed out, feeling keener than usual the consciousness that\nnobody would wait for her, or look for her, or miss her; that her\ncomings in and goings out were perfectly indifferent to every human\nbeing in the house, called by courtesy her \"home.\" Perhaps this was her\nown fault, but she could not help it. It was out of her nature to get up\nan interest among ordinary people, where interests there were none.\n\nLittle more had she in the house whither she was going to pay one of her\nextempore visits; but then there was the habit of old affection, begun\nbefore characters develop themselves into the infinite variety from\nwhich mental sympathy is evolved. She could not help liking Emma\nThornycroft, her sole childish acquaintance, whose elder sister had been\nAgatha's daily governess, until she died.\n\n\"I know Emma will be glad to see me, which is something; and if she does\ntire me with talk about the babies, why, children are better than Berlin\nwool. And there is always the piano. Besides, I must walk out, or I\nshall rust to death in this horrible Bedford Square.\"\n\nShe walked on, rather in a misanthropic mood, a circumstance to her not\nrare. But she had never known mother, sister, or brother; and the\nname of father was to her little more than an empty sound. It had\noccasionally come mistily over the Indian Ocean, in the shape of formal\nletters--the only letters that ever visited the dull London house where\nshe spent her shut-up childhood, and acquired the accomplishments of her\nteens. Mr. Bowen died on the high seas: and when his daughter met the\nship at Southampton, a closed black coffin was all that remained to her\nof the name of father. That bond, like all others, was destined to be to\nher a mere shadow. Poor Agatha!\n\nQuick exercise always brings cheerfulness when one is young, strong,\nand free from any real cares; Agatha's imaginary ones, together with the\nvague sentimentalisms into which she was on the verge of falling, yet\nhad not fallen, vanished under the influence of a cheerful walk on a\nsunny summer's day. She arrived at Mrs. Thornycroft's time enough to\nfind that admirable young matron busied in teaching to her eldest boy\nthe grand mystery of dining; that is, dining like a Christian, seated\nat a real table with a real silver knife and fork. These latter Master\nJames evidently preferred poking into his eyes and nose, rather than his\nmouth, and evinced far greater anxiety to sit on the table than on the\nchair.\n\n\"Agatha, dear--so glad to see you!\" and Emma's look convinced even\nAgatha that this was true. \"You will stay, of course! Just in time to\nsee James eat his first dinner, like a man! Now Jemmie, wipe his pretty\nmouth, and then give Auntie Agatha a sweet kiss.\"\n\nAgatha submitted to the kiss, though she did not quite believe in the\nadjective; and felt a certain satisfaction in knowing that the title of\n\"Auntie\" was a mere compliment. She did not positively dislike children,\nelse she would have been only half a woman, or a woman so detestable as\nto be an anomaly in creation; but her philoprogenitiveness was, to say\nthe least, dormant at present; and her sense of infantile beauty being\nfounded on Sir Joshua's and Murillo's cherubs, she had no great fancy\nfor the ugly little James.\n\nShe laid aside her bonnet, and smoothing her curls in the nursery\nmirror, looked for one minute at her Pawnee-Indian face, the sight of\nwhich now often made her smile. Then she sat down to lunch with Emma and\nthe children; being allowed, as a great favour, to be placed next Master\nJames, and drink with him out of his silver mug. Miss Bowen accepted the\noffered honour calmly, made no remark, but--went thirsty.\n\nFor an hour or two she sat patiently listening to what had gone on in\nthe house since she was there---how baby had cut two more teeth, and\nJames had had a new braided frock--(which was sent for that she might\nlook at it)--how Missy had been to her first children's party, and was\nto learn dancing at Midsummer, if papa could be coaxed to agree.\n\n\"How is Mr. Thornycroft?\" asked Agatha.\n\n\"Oh, very well--papa is always well. I only wish the little ones took\nafter him in that respect.\"\n\nAgatha, who was old enough to remember Emma engaged, and Emma newly\nmarried, smiled to think how entirely the lover beloved and the\nall-important young husband had dwindled into a mere \"Papa;\" liked and\nobeyed in a certain fashion, for Emma was a good wife, but evidently\nmade a very secondary consideration to \"the children.\"\n\nThe young girl--as yet neither married, nor in love--wondered if this\nwere always so. She often had such wonderings and speculation when she\ncame to Emma's house.\n\nShe was growing rather tired of so much domestic information, and had\nsecretly taken out her watch to see how many hours it would be to dinner\nand to Mr. Thornycroft, a sensible, intelligent man, who from love to\nhis wife had been always very kind to his wife's friends--when there\ncame the not unwelcome sound of a knock at the hall-door.\n\n\"Bless me; that is surely the Harpers. I had quite forgotten Major\nHarper and the bears.\"\n\n\"An odd conjunction,\" observed Agatha, smiling.\n\n\"Major Harper, who yesterday, for the fifth time, promised to take Missy\nto the Zoological Gardens to see the bears. He has remembered it at\nlast.\"\n\nNo, he had not remembered it; it would have been a very remarkable\ncircumstance if he had; being a person so constantly full of\nengagements, for himself and others. The visitor was only his younger\nbrother, who had often daundered in at Mrs. Thornycroft's house,\npossibly from a liking to Emma's friendly manner, or because, cast\nastray for a fortnight on the wide desert of London, he had, like\nAgatha, \"nothing to do.\"\n\nIf Nathanael had other reasons, they, of course, never came near the\nsurface, but lay buried under the silent waters of his quiet mind.\n\nAgatha was half pleased, half disappointed at seeing him. Mrs.\nThornycroft, good soul, was always charmed to have a visitor, for\nher society did not attract many. Only betraying, as usual, what was\nuppermost in her simple thoughts, she could not long conceal her regret\nconcerning little Missy and the bears.\n\nTo Agatha's great surprise, Mr. Harper, who she thought, in his\ndignified gravity, would never have condescended to such a thing,\nvolunteered to assume his brother's duty.\n\n\"For,\" said he, with a slight smile, \"I have had too many perilous\nencounters with wild bears in America, not to feel some curiosity in\nseeing a few captured ones in England.\"\n\n\"That will be charming,\" cried Mrs. Thornycroft, looking at him with a\nmixture of respect and maternal benignity. \"Then you can tell Missy all\nthose wonderful stories, only don't frighten her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I might She seems rather shy of me.\" And the adventurous young\ngentleman eyed askance a small be-ribboned child, who was creeping about\nthe room and staring at him. \"Would it not be better if\"----\n\n\"If mamma went?\"\n\n\"There, Missy, don't cry; mamma will go, and Agatha, too, if she would\nlike it?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Miss Bowen answered, with a mischievous glance at\nNathanael. \"I ought to investigate bears, if only to prove myself\ndescended from a Pawnee Indian.\"\n\nSo, once more, the heavy nut-brown curls were netted up into the crown\nof her black bonnet, and her shawl pinned on carelessly--rather too\ncarelessly for a young woman; since that gracious adornment, neatness,\nrarely increases with years. Agatha was quickly ready. In the ten\nminutes she had to wait for Mrs. Thornycroft, she felt, more than once,\nhow much merrier they would have been with the elder than the younger\nbrother. Also--for Agatha was a conscientious girl--she thought,\nseriously, what a pity it was that so pleasant and kind a man as Major\nHarper had such an unfortunate habit of forgetting his promises.\n\nYet she regretted him--regretted his flow of witty sayings that\nattracted the humorous half of her temperament, and his touches of\nseriousness or sentiment which hovered like pleasant music\nround the yet-closed portals of her girlish heart. Until\nsuddenly--conscientiousness again!--she began to be aware she was\nthinking a deal too much of Major Harper; so, with a strong effort,\nturned her attention to his brother and the bears.\n\nShe had leant on Mr. Harper's offered arm all the way to the Regent's\nPark, yet he had scarcely spoken to her. No wonder, therefore, that\nshe had had time for meditation, or that her comparison between the two\nbrothers should be rather to Nathanael's disadvantage. The balance of\nfavour, however, began to right itself a little when she saw how kind\nhe was to Emma Thornycroft, who alternately screamed at the beasts, and\nmade foolish remarks concerning them; also, how carefully he watched\nover little Missy and James, the latter of whom, with infantile\npertinacity, would poke his small self into every possible danger.\n\nAt the sunken den, where the big brown bear performs gymnastic exercises\non a centre tree, Master Jemmie was quite in his glory. He emulated\nBruin by climbing from his feet into nurse's arms--thence into mamma's,\nand lastly, much to her discomfiture, into Miss Bowen's. The attraction\nbeing that she happened to stand close to the railing and next to Mr.\nHarper, who, with a bun stuck on the end of his long stick, had coaxed\nBruin up to the very top of the tree.\n\nThere the creature swayed awkwardly, his four unwieldy paws planted\ntogether, and his great mouth silently snapping at the cakes. Agatha\ncould hardly help laughing; she, as well as the children, was so much\namused at the monster.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, give Missy your cane. Missy would like to feed bear,\" cried\nthe mamma, now very bold, going with her eldest pet to the other side of\nthe den, and attracting the animal thither.\n\nAt which little James, who could not yet speak, setting up a scream of\nvexation, tried to stretch after the creature; and whether from his\nown impetuosity or her careless hold, sprang--oh, horror!--right out\nof Agatha's arms. A moment the little muslin frock caught on the\nrailing--caught--ripped; then the sash, with its long knotted ends,\nwhich some one snatched at--nothing but the sash held up the shrieking\nchild, who hung suspended half way over the pit, in reach of the beast's\nvery jaws.\n\nThe bear did not at once see it, till startled by the mother's frightful\ncries. Then he opened his teeth--it looked almost like a grin--and began\nslowly to descend his tree, while, as slowly, the poor child's sash was\nunloosing with its weight.\n\nA murmur of horror ran through the people near; but not a man among them\noffered help. They all slid back, except Nathanael Harper.\n\nAgatha felt his sudden gripe. \"Hold my hand firm. Keep me in my\nbalance,\" he whispered, and throwing himself over to the whole extent\nof his body, and long right arm, managed to catch hold of James, who\nstruggled violently.\n\n\"Hold me tight--tighter still, or we are lost,\" said he, trying to\nwrithe back again; his hand--such a little delicate hand it seemed for a\nman--quivering with the weight of the child.\n\nShe grasped him frantically--his wrist--his shoulder--nay,--stretching\nover, linked her arms round his neck. Something in her touch seemed to\nimpart strength to him. He whispered, half gasping,--\n\n\"Hold me firm, and I'll do it yet, Agatha.\" She did not then notice, or\nrecollect till long afterwards, how he had called her by her Christian\nname, nor the tone in which he had said it.\n\nThe moment afterwards, he had lifted the child out of the den, and poor\nJemmie was screaming out his now harmless terror safe in the maternal\narms.\n\nThen, and not till then, Agatha burst into tears. Tears which no\none saw, for the mother, hugging her baby, was the very centre of a\nsympathising crowd. Mr. Harper, paler than ordinary, leaned against the\nstone-work of the den.\n\n\"Oh, from what have you saved me?\" cried Agatha, as after her\nthankfulness for the rescued life, came another thought, personal yet\nexcusable. \"Had Emma lost the child, I should have felt like a murderess\nto the day of my death.\"\n\nNathanael shook his head, trying to smile; but seemed unable to speak.\n\n\"You have not hurt yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh no. Very little. Only a strain,\" said he as he removed his hand from\nhis side. \"Go to your friend: I will come presently.\"\n\nHe did come--though not for a good while; and Miss Bowen fancied from\nhis looks that he had been more injured than he acknowledged; but she\ndid not like to inquire. Nevertheless he rose greatly in her estimation,\nless for his courage than for the presence of mind and common sense\nwhich made it Valuable, and for the self-restraint and indifference\nwhich caused him afterwards to treat the whole adventure as such a\ntrifling thing.\n\nIt was, after all, nothing very romantic or extraordinary, and happened\nin such a brief space of time, that probably the circumstance is not\nnoted in the traditionary chronicles of the Zoological Gardens, which\ncontain the frightful legend carefully related that day by several\nkeepers to Mrs. Thornycroft--how a bear had actually eaten up a child,\nfalling in the same manner into the same den.\n\nBut the adventure, slight as it may appear, made a very great and sudden\ndifference in the slender tie of acquaintanceship, hitherto subsisting\nbetween Agatha and Major Harper's brother. She began to treat Nathanael\nmore like a friend, and ceased to think of him exactly as a \"boy.\"\n\nMaster James's mamma, when she at last turned her attention from his\nbeloved small self, was full of thanks to his preserver. Mr. Harper\nassured her that his feat was merely a little exertion of muscular\nstrength, and at last grew evidently uncomfortable at being made so much\nof. Returning home with them, he would fain have crept away from the\nscene of his honours; but the good-natured, motherly-hearted Emma\nimplored him to stay.\n\n\"We will nurse you if you are hurt, which I am afraid you must be--it\nwas such a dreadful strain! Oh, Jemmie, Jemmie!\" and the poor mother\nshuddered.\n\n\"Indeed you must come in,\" added Miss Bowen kindly, seeing that Emma's\nthoughts were floating away, as appeared this time natural enough, to\nher own concerns. \"You shall rest all the evening, and we will talk to\nyou, and be very, very agreeable. Pray yield!\"\n\nNathanael argued no more, but went in \"quite lamb-like,\" as Mrs.\nThornycroft afterwards declared.\n\nThis acquiescence in him was little rewarded, Agatha thought--for the\nevening happened to be duller even than evenings usually passed at the\nThornycrofts'. The head of the household, being detained in the\nCity, did not appear; and Mrs. Thornycroft's tongue, unchecked by her\nhusband's presence, and excited by the event of the afternoon, galloped\non at a fearful rapidity. She poured out upon the luckless young man all\nthe baby biography of her family, from Missy's christening down to the\ninfant Selina's cutting of her first tooth. To all of which he listened\nwith a praiseworthy attention, giving at least silence, which was\ndoubtless all the answer Emma required.\n\nBut Agatha, whose sympathy in these things was, as before said, at\npresent small, grew half ashamed, half vexed, and finally rather\nangry--especially when she saw the pale weariness that gradually\noverspread Mr. Harper's face. More than once she hinted that he should\nhave the armchair, or lie down, or rest in some way; but he took not the\nleast notice; sitting immovably in his place, which happened to be next\nherself, and vaguely looking across the table towards Mrs. Thornycroft.\n\nAt nine o'clock, becoming paler than ever, he bestirred himself, and\ntalked of leaving.\n\n\"I ought to be going too. It is not far, and as our roads agree, I will\nwalk with you,\" said Agatha, simply.\n\nHe seemed surprised--so much so, that she almost blushed, and would\nhave retracted, save for the consciousness of her own frank and kindly\npurpose. She had watched him closely, and felt convinced that he had\nbeen more injured than he confessed; so in her generous straightforward\nfashion, she wanted to \"take care of him,\" until he was safe at his\nbrother's door, which she could see from her own. And her solitary\neducation had been conducted on such unworldly principles, that she\nnever thought there was anything remarkable or improper in her proposing\nto walk home with a young man, whom she knew she could trust in every\nway, and who was besides Major Harper's brother.\n\nNor did even the matronly Mrs. Thornycroft object to the plan--save that\nit took her visitors away so early. \"Surely,\" she added, \"you can't be\ntired out already.\"\n\nAgatha had an ironical answer on the very tip of her tongue: but\nsomething in the clear, \"good\" eye of Nathanael repressed her little\nwickedness. So she only whispered to Emma that for various reasons she\nhad wished to return early.\n\n\"Very well, dear, since you must go, I am sure Mr. Harper will be most\nhappy to escort you.\"\n\n\"If not, I hope he will just say so,\" added Agatha, very plainly.\n\nHe smiled; and his full, soft grey eye, fixed on hers, had an\nearnestness which haunted her for many a day. She began heartily to\nlike Major Harper's brother, though only as his brother, with a sort\nof reflected regard, springing from that she felt for her guardian and\nfriend.\n\nThis consciousness made her manner perfectly easy, cheerful, and kind,\neven though they were in the perilously sentimental position of two\nyoung people strolling home together in the soft twilight of a Midsummer\nevening: likewise occasionally stopping to look westward at a new moon,\nwhich peered at them round street-corners and through the open spaces of\ndarkening squares. But nothing could make these two at all romantic\nor interesting; their talk on the road was on the most ordinary\ntopics--chiefly bears.\n\n\"You seem quite familiar with wild beast life,\" Agatha observed. \"Were\nyou a very great hunter?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, for I never could muster up the courage, or the cowardice,\nwantonly to take away life. I don't remember ever shooting anything,\nexcept in self-defence, which was occasionally necessary during the\njourneys that I used to make from Montreal to the Indian settlements\nwith Uncle Brian.\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian,\" repeated Agatha, wondering whether Major Harper had ever\nmentioned such a personage, during the two years of their acquaintance.\nShe thought not, since her memory had always kept tenacious record of\nwhat he said about his relatives--which was at best but little. It\nwas one of the few things in him which jarred upon Agatha's\nfeelings--Agatha, to whose isolation the idea of a family and a home was\nso pathetically sweet--his seeming so totally indifferent to his own.\nAll she knew of Major Harper's kith and kin was, that he was the eldest\nbrother of a large family, settled somewhere down in Dorsetshire.\n\nThese thoughts swept through her mind, as Agatha, repeated\ninterrogatively \"Uncle Brian?\"\n\n\"The same who fifteen years since took me out with him to America; my\nfather's youngest brother. Has Frederick never told you of him? They two\nwere great companions once.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" And Agatha, seeing that Nathanael at least showed no\ndislike, but rather pleasure, in speaking of his family, thought she\nmight harmlessly indulge her curiosity about the Harpers of Dorsetshire.\n\"And you went away with Mr. Brian Harper, at ten years old. How could\nyour mother part with you?\"\n\n\"She was dead--she died when I was born. But I ought to apologise for\nthus talking of family matters, which cannot interest you.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they do--very much!\" cried Agatha; and then blushed\nat her own earnestness, at which Nathanael brightened up into positive\nwarmth.\n\n\"How kind you are! how I wish you knew my sisters! It is so pleasant to\nme to know them at last, after writing to them and thinking about them\nfor these many years. How you would like our home--I call it home,\nforgetting that I have been only a visitor, and in a short time must go\nback to my real home, Montreal.\"\n\n\"Must you indeed!\" And Agatha felt sorry. She had been at once surprised\nand gratified by the confidential way in which this usually reserved\nyoung man talked to her, and her alone. \"Why do you live in America? I\nhate Americans.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said he, smiling, as if he read her thoughts. \"But I have\nneither Yankee blood nor education. I was English born; brought up in\nBritish Canada, and by Uncle Brian.\"\n\nHe spoke the latter words with a certain proud affection, as if his\nuncle's mere name were sufficient guarantee for himself. Agatha secretly\nwondered what could possibly be the reason that Major Harper had never\neven mentioned this personage, whom Nathanael seemed to hold in such\nhonour.\n\n\"Of course,\" he continued, \"though I dearly like England, though\"--and\nhe sunk his voice a little--\"though now it will be doubly hard to go\naway, I could never think of leaving Uncle Brian to spend his old age\nalone in the country of his adoption.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" returned Agatha, absently, her thoughts still running on this\nnew Mr. Harper. \"What profession is he?\"\n\n\"Nothing now. He has led an unsettled life--always poor. But he took\ncare to settle me in a situation under the Canadian Government. We both\nthink ourselves well to do now.\"\n\nAgatha's sense of womanly decorum could hardly keep her from pressing\nher companion's arm, in instinctive acknowledgment of his goodness. She\nthought his face looked absolutely beautiful.\n\nHowever, restraining her quick impulses within the bounds of propriety,\nshe walked on. \"And so you will again cross that fearful Atlantic\nOcean?\" she said at length, with a slight shudder. The young man saw\nher gesture, and looked surprised--nay, gladdened. But nevertheless he\nremained silent.\n\nAgatha did the same, for the mention of the sea brought back to her\nthe one only noteworthy incident of her life, which had given her this\nstrange antipathy to the sea and to the thought of traversing it. But\nthis subject--the horrible bugbear of her childhood--she rarely liked\nto recur to, even now; so it did not mingle in her conversation with Mr.\nHarper.\n\nAt last Nathanael said: \"I would it were possible--indeed I have often\nvainly tried--to persuade Uncle Brian to come back to England. But since\nhe will not, it is clearly right for me to return to Canada. Anne Valery\nsays so.\"\n\n\"Anne Valery!\" again repeated Agatha, catching at this second strange\nname with which she was supposed to be familiar.\n\n\"What, did you never hear of her--my father's ward, my sister's chief\nfriend--quite one of the family? Is it possible that my brother never\nspoke to you of Anne Valery?\"\n\nNo, certainly not. Agatha was quite sure of that. The circumstance\nof Major Harper's having a friend who bore the very suspicious and\nromantically-interesting name of Anne Valery could never have slipped\nMiss Bowen's memory. She answered Nathanael's question in an abrupt\nnegative; but all the way through Russell Square she silently pondered\nas to who, or what like, Anne Valery could be? finally sketching a\nfancy portrait of a bewitching young creature, with blue eyes and golden\nhair--the style of beauty which Agatha most envied, because it was most\nunlike herself.\n\nEre reaching Dr. Ianson's door, her attention was called to Mr. Harper,\nwhose feet dragged so wearily along, that Agatha was convinced that, in\nspite of his efforts to conceal it, he was seriously ill. Her womanly\nsympathy rose--she earnestly pressed him to come in and consult Dr.\nIanson.\n\n\"No--no. Uncle Brian and I always cure ourselves. As he often says, 'A\nman after forty is either a doctor or a fool.'\"\n\n\"But you are only twenty-five.\"\n\n\"Ay, but I have seen enough to make me often feel like a man of forty,\"\nsaid he, smiling. \"Do not mind me. That strain was rather too much; but\nI shall be all right in a day or two.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" cried Agatha, anxiously; \"since, did you suffer, I should\nfeel as if it were all of my causing, and for me.\n\n\"Do you think I should regret that?\" said the young man, in a tone so\nlow, that its meaning scarcely reached her. Then, as if alarmed at his\nown words, he shook hands with her hastily, and walked down the square.\n\nAgatha thought how different was the abrupt, singular manner of\nNathanael from Major Harper's tender, lingering, courteous adieu.\nNevertheless, she fulfilled her kind purpose towards the young man; and\nrunning to her own window, watched his retreating figure, till her mind\nwas relieved by seeing him safely enter his brother's door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nA week--nay, more than a week slipped by in the customary monotony of\nthat large, placidly genteel, Bedford Square house, and Agatha heard\nnothing of the house round the corner, which constituted one of the\nfaint few interests of her existence. Sometimes she felt vexed at the\nlengthened absence of her friend and \"guardian,\" as she persisted in\nconsidering him; sometimes the thought of young Nathanael's pale\nface crossed her fancy, awakening both sincere compassion and an\nuncomfortable doubt that all might not be going on quite right within\nthe half-drawn window-blinds, at which she now and then darted a curious\nglance.\n\nAt last her curiosity or interest rose to such a pitch, that it is to\nbe feared that Agatha in her independent spirit, and ignorance of, or\nindifference to the world, might have committed the terrific\nimpropriety of making a good-natured inquiry at the door of this\nbachelor-establishment. She certainly would, had it consisted only of\nthe harmless youth Nathanael; but then Major Harper, at the mention of\nwhose name Mrs. Ianson now began to smile aside, and the invalid Jane to\ndart towards Agatha quick, inquisitive looks--No; she felt an invincible\nrepugnance to knocking, on any pretence, at Major Harper's door.\n\nHowever, having nothing to do and little to think of, and, moreover,\nbeing under the unwholesome necessity of keeping all her thoughts to\nherself, her conjectures grew into such a mountain of discomfort--partly\nselfish, partly generous, out of the hearty gratitude which had been\nawakened in her towards the younger brother since the adventure with\nthe bear--that Miss Bowen set off one fine morning, hoping to gain\nintelligence of her neighbours by the round-about medium of Emma\nThornycroft.\n\nBut that excellent matron had had two of her children ill with some\ninfantine disease, and had in consequence not a thought to spare for any\none out of her own household. The name of Harper never crossed her lips\nuntil Agatha, using a safe plural, boldly asked the question, \"Had Emma\nseen anything of them?\"\n\nMrs. Thorny croft could not remember.--Yes, she fancied some one had\ncalled--Mr. Harper, perhaps; or no, it must have been the Major, for\nsomebody had said something about Mr. Nathanael's being ill or out of\ntown. But the very day after that the measles came out on James, and\npoor little Missy had just been moved out of the night-nursery into the\nspare bed-room, etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe rest of Emma's information concerning her babies was, as they say\nin the advertisements of lost property, \"of no value to anybody but the\noriginal owner.\"\n\nAgatha bestowed a passing regret on young Nathanael, whether he were ill\nor out of town; she would have liked to have seen more of him. But that\nMajor Harper should contrive to saunter up to the Regent's Park to visit\nthe Thornycrofts, and never find time to turn a street-corner to say\n\"How d'ye do\" to _her_! she thought neither courteous nor kind.\n\nThere was little inducement to spend the day with Emma, who, in her\npresent mood and the state of her household, was a mere conversational\nDr. Buchan--a walking epitome of domestic medicine. So Miss Bowen\nextended her progress; took an early dinner with Mrs. Hill, and stayed\nall the afternoon at that good old lady's silent and quiet lodgings,\nwhere there was neither piano nor books, save one, which Agatha\npatiently read aloud for two whole hours--\"The life of Elizabeth Fry.\"\nA volume uninteresting enough to a young creature like herself, yet\nsometimes smiting her with involuntary reflections, as she contrasted\nher own aimless, useless existence with the life of that worthy\nQuakeress--the prison-angel.\n\nHaving tired herself out, first with reading and then with singing--very\nprosy and lengthy ballads of the old school, which were the ditties Mrs.\nHill always chose--Agatha departed much more cheerful than she came.\nSo great strength and comfort is there in having something to do,\nespecially if that something happens to be, according to the old\nnursery-rhyme--\n\nNot for ourself, but our neighbour.\n\nAnother day passed--which being rainy, made the Doctor's dull house seem\nmore inane than ever to the girl's restless humour. In the evening, at\nhis old-accustomed hour, Major Harper \"dropped in,\" and Agatha forgot\nhis sins of omission in her cordial welcome. Very cordial it was, and\nunaffected, such as a young girl of nineteen may give to a man of forty,\nwithout her meaning being ill-construed. But under it Major Harper\nlooked pathetically sentimental and uncomfortable. Very soon he moved\naway and became absorbed in delicate attentions towards the sick and\nsuffering Jane Ianson.\n\nAgatha thought his behaviour rather odd, but generously put upon it\nthe best construction possible--viz. his known kind-heartedness. So she\nherself went to the other side of the invalid couch, and tried to make\nmirth likewise.\n\nAsking after Mr. Harper, she learnt that her friend had been acting as\nsick-nurse, to his brother for some days.\n\n\"Poor fellow--he will not confess that he is ill, or what made him so.\nBut I hope he will be about again soon, for they are anxiously expecting\nhim in Dorsetshire. Nathanael is the 'good boy' of our family, and as\nworthy a creature as ever breathed.\"\n\nAgatha smiled with pleasure to see the elder brother waxing so\ngenerously warm; but when she smiled, Major Harper sighed, and cast his\nhandsome eyes another way. All the evening he scarcely talked to her\nat all, but to Mrs. and Miss Ianson. Agatha was quite puzzled by this\npointed avoidance, not to say incivility, and had some thoughts\nof plainly asking him if he were vexed with her; but womanly pride\nconquered girlish frankness, and she was silent.\n\nAfter tea their quartett was broken by a visitor, whom all seemed\nastonished to see, and none more so than Major Harper.\n\n\"Why, Nathanael, I thought you were safely disposed of with your sofa\nand book. What madness makes you come out to-night?\"\n\n\"Inclination, and weariness,\" returned the other, indifferently, as,\nwithout making more excuses or apologies, he dragged himself to the\narm-chair, which Miss Bowen good-naturedly drew out for him, and slipped\ninto the circle, quite naturally.\n\n\"Well, wilful lads must have their way,\" cried his brother, \"and I am\nonly too glad to see you so much better.\"\n\nWith that the flow of the Major's winning conversation recommenced; in\nwhich current all the rest of the company lay like silent pebbles, only\ntoo happy to be bubbled round by such a pleasant and refreshing stream.\n\nThe younger Harper sat in his arm-chair, leaning his forehead on his\nhand, and from under that curve now and then looking at them all,\nespecially Agatha.\n\nAt a late hour the brothers went away, leaving Mrs. and Miss Ianson in\na state of extreme delight, and Miss Bowen in a mood that, to say the\nleast, was thoughtful--more thoughtful than usual.\n\nAfter that lively evening followed three dull days, consisting of\na solitary forenoon, an afternoon walk through the squares, dinner,\nbackgammon, and bed; the next morning, _de capo al fine_, and so on; a\ndance of existence as monotonous as that of the spheres, and not half so\nmusical. On the fourth day, while Miss Bowen was out walking, Nathanael\nHarper called to take leave before his journey to Dorsetshire. He stayed\nsome time, waiting Agatha's return, Mrs. Ianson thought; but finally\nchanged his mind, and made an abrupt departure, for which that young\nlady was rather sorry than otherwise.\n\nThe fifth day, Emma Thornycroft appeared, and, strange to say, without\nany of her little ones; still stranger, without many references to them\non her lips, except the general information that they were all getting\nwell now.\n\nThe busy woman evidently had something on her mind, and plunged at once\n_in m\u00c3\u00a9dias res_.\n\n\"Agatha, dear, I came to have a little talk with you.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Agatha smiling; calmly and prepared to give up her\nmorning to the discussion of some knotty point in dress or infantile\neducation. But she soon perceived that Emma's pretty face was too\nominously important for anything short of that gravest interest of\nfeminine life--matrimony; or more properly in this case--match-making.\n\n\"Agatha, love,\" repeated Emma, with the affectionate accent that was\nalways quite real, but which now deepened under the circumstances of\nthe case, \"do you know that young Northen has been speaking to Mr.\nThornycroft about you again.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for it,\" was the short answer.\n\n\"But, my dear,'isn't it a great pity that you could not like the young\nman? Such a good young man too, and with such a nice establishment\nalready. If you could only see his house in Cumberland Terrace--the real\nTurkey carpets, inlaid tables, and damask chairs.\"\n\n\"But I can't marry carpets, tables, and chairs.\"\n\n\"Agatha, you are _so_ funny! Certainly not, without the poor man\nhimself. But there is no harm in him, and I am sure he would make an\nexcellent husband.\"\n\n\"I sincerely hope so, provided he is not mine. Come, Tittens, tell Mrs.\nThornycroft what _you_ think on the matter,\" cried the wilful girl,\ntrying to turn the question off by catching her little favourite. But\nEmma would not thus be set aside. She was evidently well primed with a\nstronger and steadier motive than what usually occupied and sufficed her\neasy mind.\n\n\"Ah, how can you be so childish! But when you come to my age\"---\n\n\"I shall, in a few more years. I wonder if I shall be as young-looking\nas you, Emma?\" This was a very adroit thrust on the part of Miss Agatha,\nbut for once it failed.\n\n\"I hope and trust so, dear. That is, if you have as good a husband as\nI have. Only, be he what he may, he cannot be such another as my dear\nJames.\"\n\nAgatha internally hoped he might not; for, much as she liked and\nrespected Emma's good spouse, her ideal of a husband was certainly not\nMr. James Thornycroft.\n\n\"Tell me,\" continued the anxious matron, keeping up the charge--\"tell\nme, Agatha, do you ever intend to marry at all?\n\n\"Perhaps so; I can't say. Ask Tittens!\"\n\n\"Did you ever think in earnest of marrying? And\"--here with an air of\nreal concern Emma stole her arm round her friend's waist--\"did you ever\nsee anybody whom you fancied you could like, if he asked you?\"\n\nAgatha laughed, but the colour was rising in her brown cheek. \"Tut, tut,\nwhat nonsense!\"\n\n\"Look at me, dear, and answer seriously.\"\n\nAgatha, thus hemmed in, turned her face full round, and said, with\nsome dignity, \"I do not know, Emma, what right you have to ask me that\nquestion.\"\n\n\"Ah, it is so; I feared it was,\" sighed Emma, not in the least offended.\n\"I often thought so, even before he hinted\"------\n\n\"Who hinted--and what?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you; I promised not. And of course you ought not to know.\nOh, dear, what am I letting out!\" added poor Mrs. Thornycroft, in much\ndiscomfiture.\n\n\"Emma, you will make me angry. What ridiculous notion have you got\ninto your head? What on earth do you mean?\" cried Miss Bowen, speaking\nquicker than her usual quick fashion, and dashing the kitten off her\nknee as she rose.\n\n\"Don't be vexed with me, my poor dear girl. It may not be so--I hope\nnot; and even if it were, he is so handsome, so agreeable, and talks so\nbeautifully--I am sure you are not the first woman by many a dozen that\nhas been in love with him.\"\n\n\"With whom?\" was the sharp question, as Agatha grew quite pale.\n\n\"I must not say.--Ah, yes--I must. It may be a mere supposition. I wish\nyou would only tell me so, and set my mind at rest, and his too. He is\nquite unhappy about it, poor man, as I see. Though, to be sure, he could\nnot help it, even if you did care for him.\"\n\n\"Him--what 'him?'\"\n\n\"Major Harper.\"\n\nAgatha's storm of passion sank to a dead calm. She sat down again\ncomposedly, turning her flushed cheeks from the light.\n\n\"This is a new and very entertaining story. You will be kind enough,\nEmma, to tell me the whole, from beginning to end.\"\n\n\"It all lies in a nutshell, my dear. Oh, how glad I am that you take it\nso quietly. Then, perhaps it is all a mistake, arising from your hearty\nmanner to every one. I told him so, and said that he need not scruple\nvisiting you, or be in the least afraid that\"----\n\n\"That I was in love with him? He _was_ afraid, then? He informed you so?\nVery kind of him! I am very much obliged to Major Harper.\"\n\n\"There now--off you go again. Oh, if you would but be patient\"\n\n\"Patient--when the only friend I had insults me!--when I have neither\nfather, nor brother,--nobody--nobody\"----\n\nShe stopped, and her throat choked; but the struggle was in vain; she\nburst into uncontrollable tears.\n\n\"You have me, Agatha, always me, and James!\" cried Emma, hanging about\nher neck, and weeping for company; until, very soon, the proud girl\nshut down the floodgates of her passion, and became herself again.\nHerself--as she could not have been, were there a mightier power\ndwelling in her heart than pride.\n\n\"Now, Emma, since you have seen how the thing has vexed me, though\nnot\"--and she laughed--\"not as being one of the many dozens of fools in\nlove with Major Harper--will you tell me how this amusing circumstance\narose?\"\n\n\"I really cannot, my dear. The whole thing was so hurried and confused.\nWe were talking together, very friendly and sociably, as the Major and\nI always do, about you; and how much I wished you to be settled in life,\nas he must wish likewise, being the trustee of your little fortune, and\nstanding in a sort of fatherly relation towards you. He did not seem to\nlike the word; looked very grave and very\"--\n\n\"Compassionate, doubtless! Said 'he had reason to believe, that is to\nfear, I did not regard him quite as a father!' That was it, Emma, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I am glad to see you laughing at it I don't remember his\nprecise words.\"\n\n\"Probably these: 'My dear Mrs. Thornycroft, I am greatly afraid\npoor Agatha Bowen is dying for love of me.' Very candid--and like a\ngentleman!\"\n\n\"Now you are too sarcastic; for he is a gentleman, and most kind-hearted\ntoo. If you had only seen how grieved he was at the bare idea of your\nbeing made unhappy on his account!\"\n\n\"How considerate!--and how very confidential he must have been to you!\"\n\n\"Nay, he hardly said anything plainly; I assure you he did not. Only\nsomehow he gave me the impression that he was afraid of--what I had\nfeared for a long time. For as I always told you, Agatha, Major Harper\nis a settled bachelor--too old to change. Besides, he has had so many\nwomen in love with him.\"\n\n\"Does he count their names, one by one, on his fingers, and hang their\nlocks of hair on his paletot, after the Indian fashion Nathanael Harper\ntold us of?--Poor Nathanael!\" And on her excited mood that pale \"good\"\nface rose up like a vision of serenity. She ceased to mock so bitterly\nat Nathanael's brother and her own once-honoured friend.\n\n\"I don't like your abusing Major Harper in this way,\" said Emma,\ngravely; \"we all know his little weaknesses, but he is an excellent man,\nand my husband likes him. And it is nothing so very wonderful if he has\nbeen rather confidential with a steady married woman like me--just the\nright person, in short. It was for your good too, my dear. I am sure I\nasked him plainly if he ever could think of marrying you. But he shook\nhis head, and answered, 'No, that was quite impossible.'\"\n\n\"Quite impossible, indeed,\" said Agatha, her proud lips quivering. \"And\nshould he favour you with any more confidences, you may tell him that\nAgatha Bowen never knew what it was to be 'in love' with any man.\nLikewise, that were he the only man on earth, she would not condescend\nto fall in love with or marry Major Frederick Harper.--Now, Emma, let us\ngo down to lunch.\"\n\nThey would have done so, after Mrs. Thornycroft had kissed and embraced\nher friend, in sincere delight that Agatha was quite heart-whole, and\nready to make what she called \"a sensible marriage,\" but they were\nstopped on the stairs by a letter that came by post.\n\n\"A strange hand,\" Miss Bowen observed, carelessly. \"Will you go\ndown-stairs, Emma, and I will come when I have read it.\"\n\nBut Agatha did not read it. She threw it on the floor, and turning the\nbolt of the door, paced her little drawing-room in extreme agitation.\n\n\"I am glad I did not love him--I thank God I did not love him,\" she\nmuttered by fits. \"But I might have done so, so good and kind as he was,\nand I so young, with no one to care for. And no one cares for me--no\none--no one!\"\n\n\"Young Northen\" darted through her mind, but she laughed to scorn the\npossibility. What love could there be in an empty-headed fool?\n\n\"Never any but fools have ever made love to me! Oh, if an honest, noble\nman did but love me, and I could marry, and get out of this friendless\ndesolation, this contemptible, scheming, match-making set, where I and\nmy feelings are talked of, speculated on, bandied about from house to\nhouse. It is horrible--horrible! But I'll not cry! No!\"\n\nShe dried the tears that were scorching her eyes, and mechanically took\nup her letter; until, remembering how long she had been upstairs, and\nhow all that time Emma's transparent disposition and love of talk might\nhave laid her and her whole affairs open before the Iansons, she\nquickly put the epistle in her pocket unread, and went down into the\ndining-room.\n\nIt was not till night, when she sat idly brushing out her long curls,\nand looking at her Pawnee face in the mirror--alas! the poor face now\nseemed browner and uglier than ever!--that Agatha recollected this same\nletter.\n\n\"It may give me something to think about, which will be well,\" sighed\nshe; and carelessly pushing her hair behind her ears, she drew the\ncandle nearer, and began leisurely to read.\n\n[Illustration: She began leisurely to read  p036]\n\nThe commencement was slightly abrupt:\n\n\n\"A month ago--had any one told me I should write this letter, I\ncould not have believed it possible. But strange things happen in our\nlives--things over which we seem to have no control; we are swept on by\nan impulse and a power which most often guide us for our good. I hope it\nmay be so now.\n\n\"I came to England with no intention save that of seeing my family, and\nno affection in my heart stronger than for them. Living the solitary\nlife that Uncle Brian leads, I have met with few women, and have never\nloved any woman--until now.\n\n\"You may think me a 'boy;' indeed, I overheard you say so once; but I am\na man--with a heart full of all a man's emotions, passionate and strong.\nInto that heart I took _you_, from the first moment I ever saw your\nface. This is just three weeks ago, but it might have been three\nyears--I know you so well. I have watched you continually; every trait\nof your character--every thought of your mind. From other people I have\nfound out every portion of your history--every daily action of your\nlife. I know you wholly and completely, faults and all, and--I love you.\nNo man will ever love you more than I.\n\n\"That you should have the least interest in me now, is, I am aware,\nunlikely; indeed, almost impossible; therefore I shall not expect\nor desire any answer to this letter, sent just before I leave for\nDorsetshire.\n\n\"On my return, a week hence, I shall come and see you, should you not\nforbid it. I shall come merely as a _friend_, so that you need have no\nscruple in my visiting you, once at least. If afterwards, when you know\nme better, you should suffer me to ask for another title, giving to you\nthe dearest and closest that man can give to woman--then--oh! little you\nthink how I would love you, Agatha!\n\n\"Nathanael Locke Harper.\"\n\n\nAgatha read this letter all through with a kind of fascination. Her\nfirst emotion was that of most utter astonishment. It had never crossed\nher mind that Nathanael Harper was the sort of being very likely to fall\nin love with anybody--and for him to love her! With such a love, too,\nthat despite its suddenness carried with it the impression of quiet\ndepth, strength, and endurance irresistible. It was beyond belief.\n\nShe read over again fragments of his own words. \"I took you into my\nheart from the first moment I ever saw you;\"--\"I love you--no man will\never love you more than I.\" \"Little you think how I would love you,\nAgatha!\"\n\nAgatha--who a minute before had been pondering mournfully that no one\ncared for her--that she was of no use to any one--and that no living\nsoul would miss her, were her existence blotted out from the face of\nearth that very night!\n\nShe began to tremble; ay, even though she felt that Nathanael had\njudged correctly--that she did not now love him, and probably never\nmight--still, overwhelmed with the sudden sense of _his_ great love,\nshe trembled. A strange softness crept over her; and for the second time\nthat day she yielded to a weakness only drawn from her proud heart by\nrare emotions--Agatha wept.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTo say that Agatha Bowen slept but ill that night would be unnecessary;\nsince there is probably no girl who did not do so after receiving a\nfirst love-letter. And this was indeed her first; for the commonplace\nand business-like episode of young Northen had not been beautified by\nany such compositions. A second harmless adventure of like kind had\nfurnished her with a little amusement and some vexation,--but never till\nnow had her girlish heart been approached by any wooing which she could\ninstinctively feel was that of real love. It touched her very much; for\na time absorbing all distinct resolutions or intentions in a maze of\npleasant, tender pity, and wonderment not unmixed with fear.\n\nHalf the night she lay awake, planning what she should do and say in the\nfuture; writing in her head a dozen imaginary answers to Mr. Harper's\nletter, until she recollected that he had expressly stated it required\nnone. Nevertheless, she thought she must write, if only to tell him that\nshe did not love him, and that there was not the slightest use in his\nhoping to be anything more to her than a friend.\n\n\"A friend!\" She recoiled at the word, remembering how sorely her pride\nand feelings had been wounded by him she once held to be the best friend\nshe had. She never could hold him as such any more. Her impulsive anger\nexaggerated even to wickedness the vanity of a man who fancied\nevery woman was in love with him. She forgot all Major Harper's good\nqualities, his high sense of honour, his unselfish kindheartedness, his\ngenerous, gay spirit She set him down at once as unworthy the name of\nfriend. Then--what friend had she? Not one--not one in the world.\n\nIn this strait, strangely, temptingly sweet seemed to come the words,\n\"_I love you; no man will ever love you better than I._\"\n\nTo one whose heart is altogether free, the knowledge of being deeply\nloved, and by a man whose attachment would do honour to any woman, is\na thought so soothing, so alluring, that from it spring half the\nmarriages--not strictly love-marriages--which take place in the world;\nsometimes, though not always, ending in real happiness.\n\nAgatha began to consider that it would seem very odd if she wrote to Mr.\nHarper, in his home, among his family. Perhaps his sisters might notice\nher handwriting--a useless fear, since they had never seen it; and at\nall events it would be a pity to trouble his happiness in that pleasant\nvisit, by conveying prematurely the news of his rejection. She would\nwait, and give him no answer for at least a day or two; it was such a\nbitter thing to inflict pain on any human being, especially on one so\ngentle and good as Nathanael Harper.\n\nWith this determination she went to sleep. She woke next morning, having\na confused sense that something had happened, that some one had grieved\nand offended her; and--strange consciousness, softly dawning!--that some\none loved her--deeply, dearly, as in all the days since she was born she\nhad never been loved before. That even now some one might be thinking of\nher--of her alone, as his first object in the world. The sensation was\nnew, inexplicable, but pleasant nevertheless. It made her feel--what\nthe desolate orphan girl rarely had felt--a sort of tenderness for, and\nhonouring of, herself. As she dressed, she once looked wistfully, even\npensively, in the looking-glass.\n\n\"It is certainly a queer, brown, Pawnee face! I wonder what he could see\nin it to admire. He is very good, very! I wish I could have cared for\nhim!\"\n\nHer heart trembled; all the woman in her was touched. But Agatha was\nresolved not to be sentimental, so she fastened her morning-dress rather\nmore tastefully than usual, and descended to breakfast.\n\nBeside her plate lay a letter, which was pretty closely eyed by\nthe Ianson family, as their inmate's correspondence had always been\nremarkably small.\n\n\"A black edge and seal. No bad news, I hope, my dear Miss Bowen?\" said\nthe doctor's wife, sympathetically.\n\nAgatha did not fear. Alas! in the whole wide world she had not a\nrelative to lose! And, glancing at the rather peculiar hand, she\nrecognised it at once. She remembered likewise, to account for the black\nseal, that one of the Miss Harpers had died within the year. So, whether\nfrom the spice of malice in her composition she wished to disappoint\nthe polite inquisitiveness of the Iansons, or whether from more generous\nreasons of her own, Miss Bowen left her letter unopened until the\nmeal was done; when, carelessly taking it up, she adjourned to her own\nsitting-room.\n\nThere was not the slightest necessity for any such precaution, as the\nmissive contained merely these lines:--\n\n\"In my letter of yesterday--which I doubt not you have received, since I\nposted it myself--I omitted to say that not even my brother is aware\nof it, or of its purport; as I rarely inform any one of my own private\naffairs. Though, of course, I presume not to lay the same restriction on\nyou. God bless you!\"\n\nThe \"God bless you!\" was added hastily in less neat writing, as if\nthe letter had been broken open to do it. The signature was merely\nhis initials, \"N. L. H.,\" and the date \"Kingcombe Holm,\" which Agatha\nsupposed was his father's house in Dorsetshire.\n\nThen, even there, amidst his dear home circle, he had thought of\nher! Agatha was more moved by that trifling circumstance, and by the\nself-restraint and silence that accompanied it, than she would have been\nby a whole quire of ordinary love-letters.\n\nHe did not write again during seven entire days, and while this pause\nlasted she had time to think much and deeply. She ceased to play and\ntalk confidentially with Tittens, and felt herself growing into a\nwoman fast. Great mental changes may at times be wrought in one week,\nespecially when it happens to be one of those not infrequent July weeks,\nwhich seem as if the sky were bent upon raining out at once the tears of\nthe whole summer.\n\nOn the Friday evening, when Miss Bowen, heartily tired of her\nweather-bound imprisonment, stood at the dining-room window, looking out\non a hazy, yellow glow that began to appear in the west, sparkled on the\ndrenched trees of the square, and made little bright reflections on the\nrain-pools of the pavement,--there appeared a gentleman from the house\nround the corner, carefully picking his steps by the crossing, and\nfinally landing at Doctor Ianson's door. It was Major Harper.\n\nAgatha instinctively quitted the window, but on second thoughts returned\nthither, and when he chanced to look up, composedly bowed.\n\nHe was come to spend the evening as usual, and she must meet him as\nusual too, otherwise he might think--supposing he had not yet seen Emma\nThornycroft, or even if he had,--might think--what made Agatha's cheek\nburn like fire. But she controlled herself. The first vehemence of\nher pride and anger was over now. She had discovered that the dawning\ninclination on which she had bestowed a few dreamings and sighings,\ntrying, in foolish girlish fashion, to fan a chance tinder-spark into\nthe holy altar-fire of a woman's first love--had gone out in darkness,\nand that her free heart lay quiet, in a sort of twilight shade, waiting\nfor its destiny; nor for the last few days had she even thought of\nNathanael. His silence had as yet no power to grieve or surprise her; if\nit struck her at all, it was with the hope that perhaps his wooing might\ndie out of itself, and save her the trouble of a painful refusal.\nShe had begun to think--what girls of nineteen are very slow to\ncomprehend--that there might be other things in the world besides love\nand its ideal dreams. She had read more than usual--some sensible prose,\nsome lofty-hearted poetry; and was, possibly, \"a sadder and a wiser\"\ngirl than she had been that day week.\n\nIn this changed mood, after a little burst of well-controlled temper, a\nscornful pang, and a slight trepidation of the heart, Miss Agatha Bowen\nwalked up-stairs to the drawing-room to meet Major Harper.\n\nHer manner in so doing was most commendable, and a worthy example to\nthose young ladies who have to extinguish the tiny embers of a month\nor two's idle fancy, created by an impressible nature, by girlhood's\nfrantic longing after unseen mysteries, and by the terrible misfortune\nof having nothing to do. But Miss Bowen's demeanour, so highly\ncreditable, cannot be set forward in words, as it consisted in the very\nsimplest, mildest, and politest \"How d'ye do?\"\n\nMajor Harper met her with his accustomed pleasantly tender air, until\ngradually he recollected himself, looked pensive, and subsided into\ncoldness. It was evident to Agatha that he could not have had any\ncommunication from Mrs. Thornycroft. She was growing vexed again,\nalternating from womanly wrath to childish pettishness--for in her heart\nof hearts she had a deep and friendly regard for the noble half of her\nguardian's character--when suddenly she decided that it was wisest to\nleave the room and take refuge in indifference and her piano. There she\nstayed for certainly an hour.\n\nAt length, Major Harper came softly into her sitting-room.\n\n\"Don't let me disturb you--but, when you have quite finished playing, I\nshould like to say a word to you.--Merely on business,\" he added, with\na slightly confused manner, unusual to the perfect self-possession of\nMajor Harper.\n\nAgatha sat down and faced him, so frigidly, that he seemed to withdraw\nfrom the range of her eyes. \"You do not often converse with me on\nbusiness.\"\n\nHe drew back. \"That is true. But I considered that with so young a\nlady as yourself it was needless.--And I hate all business,\" he added,\nimperatively.\n\n\"Then I regret that my father burdened you with mine.\n\n\"No burden; it is a pleasure--if by any means I can be of use to you.\nBelieve me, my dear Miss Bowen, your advantage, your security, is my\nchief aim. And therefore in this investment, of which I think it right\nto inform you\"----\n\n\"Investment?\" she repeated, turning round a childish puzzled face. \"Oh,\nMajor Harper, you know I am quite ignorant of these things. Do let us\ntalk of something else.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" he responded, evidently much relieved, and turned\nthe somewhat awkward conversation to the first available topic, which\nchanced to be his brother Nathanael.\n\n\"You cannot think how much I miss him in my rooms, even though he was\nsuch a short time with me. An excellent lad is N. L., and I hear they\nare making so much of him in Dorsetshire. They tell me he will certainly\nstay there the whole three months of his leave.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" observed Agatha, briefly. She hardly knew whether to be\npleased or sorry at this news, or by doubting it to take a feminine\npride in being so much better informed on the subject than the Harper\nfamily.\n\n\"No wonder he is so happy,\" continued the Major, with one of his\noccasional looks of momentary, though real sadness. \"Fifteen years is a\nlong time to be away. Though I fear, I myself have been almost as long\nwithout seeing the whole family together.\"\n\n\"Are they all together now?\"--Agatha felt an irresistible desire to ask\nquestions.\n\n\"I believe so; at least my father and my three unmarried sisters. Old\nbachelors and old maids are plentiful in the Harper family. We are all\nstiff-necked animals; we eschew even gilded harness.\"\n\nAgatha's cheek glowed with anger at this supposed benevolent warning to\nherself.\n\n\"I dare say your sisters are very happy, nevertheless; marriage is not\nalways a 'holy estate,'\" said she carelessly. \"But there was some other\nDorsetshire lady whom Mr. Harper told me of. Who is Anne Valery?\"\n\nMajor Frederick Harper actually started, and the deep sensitive colour,\nwhich not even his forty years and his long worldly experience could\nquite keep down, rose in his handsome face.\n\n\"So N. L. spoke to you of her. No wonder. She is an--an excellent\nperson.\"\n\n\"An excellent person,\" repeated Agatha mischievously. \"Then she is\nrather elderly, I conclude?\"\n\n\"Elderly--Anne Valery elderly! By Heavens, no!\" (And the excited Major\nused the solitary asseveration which clung to him, the last trace of\nhis brief military experience.) \"Anne Valery old! Not a day older than\nmyself! We were companions as boy and girl, young man and young woman,\nuntil--stay--ten--fifteen years ago. Fifteen years!--ah, yes--I suppose\nshe would be considered elderly now.\"\n\nAfter this burst, Major Harper sank into one of his cloudy moods. At\nlast he said, in a confidential and rather sentimental tone, \"Miss\nValery is an excellent lady--an old friend of our family; but she and I\nhave not met for many years. Circumstances necessitated our parting.\"\n\n\"Circumstances?\"\n\nAgatha guessed the truth--or fancied she did; and her wrathful pride\nwas up again. More trophies of the illustrious Frederick's unwilling\nslaughters--more heart's blood dyeing the wheels of this unconscious\nJuggernaut of female devotees! Yet there he sat, looking so pathetically\nregretful, as if he felt himself the blameless, helpless instrument of\nfate to work the sentimental woe of all womankind! Agatha was absolutely\ndumb with indignation.\n\nShe was a little unjust, even were he erring. It is often a great\nmisfortune, but it is no blame to a good man that good women--more than\none--have loved him; if, as all noble men do, he hides the humiliation\nor sorrow of their love sacredly in his own heart, and makes no boast\nof it. Of this nobility of character--rare indeed, yet not unknown or\nimpossible--Frederick Harper just fell short. Kind, clever, and amusing,\nhe might be, but he was a man not sufficiently great to be humble.\n\nNo more was said on the mysterious topic of Miss Anne Valery. Agatha was\ntoo angry; and the subject seemed painful to Major Harper. Though he did\nwhat was not his habit--especially with female friends--he endeavoured,\ninstead of encouraging, to throw off his momentary sentimentality, and\nbecome his usual witty, cheerful, agreeable self.\n\nMiss Bowen, even in her tenderest inclinings towards her guardian, had\nat times thought him a little too talkative--a little too much of the\nbrilliant man of the world. Now, in her bitterness against him, his\ngaiety was positively offensive to her. She rose, and proposed that they\nshould quit her own private room for the general drawing-room of the\nfamily.\n\nThe Iansons were all there, even the Doctor being prone to linger in his\ndull home for the pleasure of Major Harper's delightful company. There\nwas another, too, the unexpected sight of whom made both Agatha and her\ncompanion start.\n\nAs she and the Major entered, there arose, almost like an apparition\nfrom his seat in the window-recess, the tall, slight figure of\nNathanael.\n\n\"N. L.! Where on earth have you dropped from? What a _very_\nextraordinary fellow you are!\" cried the elder brother.\n\n\"Perhaps unwelcome also,\" said the quiet voice.\n\n\"Unwelcome--never, my dear boy! Only next time, do be a little more\nconfidential. Here have I been telling a whole string of apparent fibs\nabout your movements--have I not Miss Bowen? Do you not consider this\nbrother of mine the most eccentric creature in the world?\"\n\nAgatha looked up, and met the young man's eyes. Their expression could\nnot be mistaken; they were _lover's eyes_--such as never in her life she\nhad met before. They seemed constraining her to do what out of pity or\nmechanical impulse she at once did--silently to hold out her hand.\n\nNathanael took it with his usual manner. There was no other greeting\non his part or hers. Immediately afterwards he slipped away to the very\nfarthest corner of the room.\n\nIt would be hard to say whether Agatha felt relieved or disappointed at\nhis behaviour; but surprised she most certainly was. This was not the\nsort of \"lover's meeting\" of girlish imaginings; nor was he the sort of\nlover, so perfectly unobtrusive, self-restrained, and coldly calm.\nShe was glad she had not been at the pains to write the romantically\npitiful, tender refusal, which she had concocted sentence by sentence\nin her deeply-touched heart, during that first wakeful night He did not\nseem half miserable enough to need such wondrous compassion.\n\nFreed in a measure from constraint, she became her own natural self, as\nwomen rarely, indeed never, are in the presence of those they love,\nor of those by whom they believe themselves loved. Neither unpleasant\nconsciousness rested heavily on Agatha now; her demeanour was therefore\nvery sweet, candid, and altogether pleasing.\n\nMajor Harper even forgot his benevolent precautions on Miss Bowen's\naccount, and tried to render himself as agreeable as heretofore, talking\naway at a tremendous rate, and with most admirable eloquence, while his\nbrother sat silent in a corner. The contrast between them was never\nso strong. But once or twice Agatha, wearied out with laughing and\nlistening, stole a look towards the figure that she felt was sitting\nthere; and encountered the only sign Nathanael gave,--the unmistakeable\n\"lover's eyes.\" They seemed to pierce into her heart and make it\nquiver--not exactly with tenderness, but with the strange controlling\nsense by which the love of a strong nature, reticent, and self-possessed\neven in its utmost passion--at times appears to enfold a woman--and\nany true affection, whether of lover or friend, to those who have never\nknown it, and are unconsciously pining for lack of it, comes at first\nlike water in a thirsty land.\n\nMiss Bowen's frank gaiety died slowly away, and she fell into more\nthan one long reverie, which did not escape the benign notice of her\nguardian. He grew serious, and made an attempt to remove from her his\nown dangerous proximity.\n\n\"Come, N. L., it is time we vanished. You have never told me the least\nfragment of news from home--that is, from Kingcombe.\"\n\n\"You were too much engaged, brother. But we have plenty of time.\"\n\n\"Kingcombe; is that the place your father lives at?\" said Mrs. lanson,\nwho took a patronising interest in the young man. \"What a pretty name!\nWere you aware of it, Miss Bowen?\"\n\nAgatha, for her life, could not help changing colour as she answered\n\"Yes,\" knowing perfectly well who was watching her the while, and that\nhe and she were thinking of the same thing, namely, the brief note whose\ndate was her only information as to the family residence of the Harpers.\n\n\"Kingcombe is as pretty as its name,\" observed the elder brother,--\"a\nname more peculiar than at first seems. It was given by a loyal Harper\nduring the Protectorate. It had been St. Mary's Abbey, but he, with\npretended sanctimoniousness, changed the name, and called it _Kingcombe\nHolm_; as a gentle hint from the Dorsetshire coast to Prince Charles\nover the water. Ah! a clever fellow was my great-great-grandfather,\nGeoffrey Harper!\"\n\nAll laughed at the anecdote, and the Iansons looked with additional\nrespect on the man who thus carelessly counted his grandfathers up to\nthe Commonwealth. But Mrs. Ianson's curiosity penetrated even to the\nHarpers of Queen Victoria's day.\n\n\"Indeed we can't let you two gentlemen away so early. If you have family\nmatters to talk over, suppose we send you for half-an-hour to Miss\nBowen's drawing-room! or, if they are not secrets, pray discuss them\nhere. I am sure we are all greatly interested; are we not, Miss Bowen?\"\n\nAgatha made some unintelligible answer. She thought Nathanael's quick\neyes darted from her to Mrs. lanson and back again, as if to judge\nwhether, young-lady-like, she had told his secret to all her female\nfriends. But there was something in Agatha's countenance which marked\nher out as that rare character, a woman who can hold her tongue--even in\na love affair.\n\nAfter a minute she looked at Mr. Harper gravely, kindly, as if to say,\n\"You need not fear--I have not betrayed you;\" and meeting her candid\neyes, his suspicions vanished. He drew nearer to the circle, and began\nto talk.\n\n\"Mrs. lanson is very kind, but we need not hold any such solemn\nconclave, Frederick,\" said he, smiling. \"All the news that I did not\nunfold in my letter of yesterday, I can tell you now. I would like every\none here to be interested in our good sisters and in all at home.\"\n\n\"Yes--oh, yes,\" responded the other, mechanically. \"Any messages for\nme?\"\n\n\"My father says he hopes to see you this autumn at Kingcombe. He is\ngrowing an old man now.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!--An admirable man is my father, Miss Bowen. Quite a\ngentleman of the old school; but peculiar--rather peculiar. Well, what\nelse, Nathanael?\"\n\n\"Elizabeth, since Emily's death, seems to have longed after you very\nmuch.--You were the next eldest, you know, and she fancies you were\nalways very like Emily. She says it is so long since you have been to\nKingcombe.\"\n\n\"It is such a dull place. Besides I have seen them all elsewhere\noccasionally.\"\n\n\"All but Elizabeth; and, you know, unless you go to Kingcombe, you never\ncan see Elizabeth,\" said the younger brother, gently.\n\n\"That is true!--Poor dear soul!\" Frederick answered, looking grave.\n\"Well, I will go ere long.\"\n\n\"Perhaps at Eulalie's wedding, which I told you of?\"\n\n\"True--true. Eulalie is the youngest Miss Harper, as we should explain\nto our kind friends here--whom I hope we are not boring very much with\nour family reminiscences. And Eulalie, contrary to the usual custom of\nthe Harpers, is actually going to be married. To a clergyman, is he not,\nN. L.?--late Curate of Kingcombe parish?\"\n\n\"No--of Anne Valery's parish. By the way, you have not yet asked a\nsingle question about Anne Valery.\"\n\nThe Major's aspect visibly changed. In all the years of his acquaintance\nwith the world he had not yet learnt the convenient art of being a\nphysiognomical hypocrite. \"Well, never mind--I ask a dozen questions\nnow. How could I forget so excellent a friend of the family?\"\n\n\"She is indeed,\" said Nathanael, earnestly, while a glow of pleasure or\nenthusiasm dyed his pale features, and he even ceased his close watch\nover Agatha. \"Though I was such a boy when I left, I find I have kept a\ntrue memory of Anne Valery. She is just the woman I always pictured\nher, from my own remembrance, and from Uncle Brian's chance allusions;\nthough, in general, it was little enough he said of England or home. I\nwas quite surprised to hear from Elizabeth what a strong friendship used\nto exist between Uncle Brian, yourself, and Anne Valery.\"\n\nMajor Harper's restlessness increased. \"Really, we are indulging our\nfriends with our whole genealogy--uncles, aunts, and collateral branches\nincluded--which cannot be very interesting to Mrs. and Miss Ianson,\nor even to Miss Bowen, however kindly she may be disposed towards the\nHarper family.\"\n\nThe Iansons here made polite disclaimers, but Agatha said nothing.\nImmediately afterwards, Nathanael's conversation likewise ebbed away\ninto silence.\n\nThe next time Agatha heard him speak was in answer to a sudden\nquestion of his brother's as to what had made him return to London so\nunexpectedly. \"I thought you would have stayed at least three months.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said in a low tone; \"by that time I shall be far enough away.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"From circumstances which have lately arisen\"--he did not look at\nAgatha, but she felt his meaning--\"I fear I must return to America at\nonce.\"\n\nHe said no more, for his brother asked no more questions. But the\ntidings jarred painfully on Agatha's mind.\n\nHe was then going away, this man of so gentle, true and noble\nnature--this, the only man who loved her, and whom, while she thought of\nrejecting, she had still hoped to retain as an honoured and dear friend.\nHe was going away, and she might never see him more. She felt grieved,\nand her lonely, unloved position rose up before her in more bitterness\nand more fear than it was wont to do. She became as thoughtful and\nsilent as Nathanael himself.\n\nMr. Harper never attempted to address her or attract her attention\nduring all that strange, long evening, which comprised in itself so many\nslight circumstances, so many conflicting states of feeling. Almost the\nonly word this very eccentric lover said to her was in a whisper, just\nas his hand touched hers in bidding good-bye.\n\n\"As I am leaving England so soon, may I come here again to-morrow?\"\n\n\"No, not to-morrow;\" and then, her kind heart repenting of the evident\npain she gave, she added, \"Well, the day after to-morrow, if you like.\nBut\"----\n\nWhatever that forbidding \"but\" was meant to hint, Nathanael did not stay\nto hear. He was gone in a moment.\n\nHowever, that night a chance word of Mrs. Ianson's did more for the suit\nof the unloved, or only half-loved lover, than he himself ever dreamed\nof.\n\n\"Well,\" said that lady, with sly, matronly smile, as, showing more\nattention than usual, she lighted Agatha's candle for bed--\"Well, my\ndear Miss Bowen, is the wedding to be at my house?\"\n\n\"What wedding?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know; you know! I have guessed it a long while, but\nto-night--surely, I may congratulate you? Never was there a more\ncharming man than Major Harper.\"\n\nAgatha looked furious. \"Has he then\"--\"told you the lie he told to\nEmma\"--she was about to say, but luckily checked herself. \"Has he then\nbeen so premature as to give you this information?\"\n\n\"No! oh, of course not. But the thing is as plain as light.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Mrs. Ianson. He is one of my very kindest friends;\nbut I have never had the slightest intention of marrying Major Harper.\"\n\nWith that she took her candle, and walked slowly to her own room. There,\nwith her door locked, though that was needless, since there was\nno welcome or unwelcome friendship likely to intrude on her utter\nsolitude,--she gave way to a woman's wounded pride. Added to this, was\nthe terror that seizes a helpless young creature, who, all supports\ntaken away, is at last set face to face with the cruel world, without\neven the steadfastness given by a strong sorrow. If she had really loved\nFrederick Harper, perhaps her condition would have been more endurable\nthan now.\n\nAt length, above the storm of passion there seemed floating an audible\nvoice, just as if the mind of him who she knew was always thinking of\nher, then spoke to her mind, with the wondrous communication that has\noften happened in dreams, or waking, between two who deeply loved. A\ncommunication which appears both possible and credible to those who have\nfelt any strong human attachment, especially that one which for the sake\nof its object seems able to cross the bounds of distance, time, life, or\neternity.\n\nIt was a thing that neither then or afterwards could she ever account\nfor, and years elapsed before she mentioned the circumstance to any\none. But while she lay weeping across her bed, Agatha seemed to hear\ndistinctly, just as if it had been a voice gliding past the window,\nhalf-mixing with the wind that was then rising, the words:\n\n\"_I love you! No man will ever love you like me._\"\n\nThat night, before she slept, her determination was taken.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nNext morning Miss Bowen astonished every one, and excited once more Mrs.\nIanson's incredulous smile, by openly desiring the servant who waited to\ntake a message for her to Major Harper's. It was to the effect that she\nwished immediately to see that gentleman, could he make it convenient to\nvisit her.\n\nThe message was given by her very distinctly, and with most creditable\ncalmness, considering that the destinies of her whole life hung on the\nsentence.\n\nMajor Harper appeared, and was shown into Miss Bowen's drawing-room. She\nwas not there, and the Major waited rather uneasily for several minutes,\nunaware that half of that time she had been standing without, her hand\non the lock of the door. But her tremulousness was that of natural\nemotion, not of fluctuating purpose. No physiognomist studying Agatha's\nmouth and chin would doubt the fact, that though rather slow to\nwill--when she had once willed, scarcely anything had power to shake her\nresolution.\n\nShe went in at last, and bade Major Harper good morning. \"I have sent\nfor you,\" she said, \"to talk over a little business.\"\n\n\"Business!\"--And the hesitation and discomfort which seemed to arise in\nhim at the mere mention of the word again were visible in Major Harper.\n\n\"Not trust business--something quite different,\" said Agatha, scarcely\nable to help smiling at the alarm of her guardian.\n\n\"Then anything you like, my dear Miss Bowen! I have nothing in the world\nto do to-day. That stupid brother of mine is worse company than none\nat all. He said he had letters to write to Kingcombe, and vanished\nup-stairs! The rude fellow! But he is an excellent fellow too.\"\n\n\"So you have always said. He appears to love his home, and be much\nbeloved there. Is it so?\"\n\n\"Most certainly. Already they know him better than they do me, and care\nfor him more; though he has been away for fifteen years. But then he has\nkept up a constant correspondence with them; while I, tossing about in\nthe world--ah! I have had a hard life, Miss Bowen!\"\n\nHe looked so sad, that Agatha felt sorry for him. But his melancholy\nmoods had less power to touch her than of old. His gaiety so quickly\nand invariably returned, that her belief in the reality of his grief was\nsomewhat shaken.\n\nShe paused a little, and then recurred again, indifferently as it were,\nto Nathanael--the one person in his family of whom Major Harper always\nspoke gladly and warmly.\n\n\"You seem to have a great love for your younger brother. Is he then so\nnoble a character?\"\n\n\"What do you call a noble character, my dear young lady?\"\n\nThe half-jesting, half-patronising manner irritated Agatha; but she\nanswered boldly:\n\n\"A man honest in his principles, faithful to his word; just, generous,\nand honourable.\"\n\n\"What a category of qualities! How interested young ladies are in a\npale, thin boy! Well then\"--seeing that Agatha looked serious--\"well\nthen, I declare to Heaven that, even according to your high-flown\ndefinitions, he is as noble a lad as ever breathed. I can find no\nfault in him, except that, as I said, he is such a mere boy. Are\nyou satisfied? Did you want to try if I were indeed a heartless,\nunbrotherly, good-for-nothing fellow, as you appear to think me\nsometimes?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Agatha briefly, noticing with something like scorn the\nMajor's instinctive assumption that her questions must have some near\nor remote reference to himself, while he never once guessed their real\nmotive. That answered, she changed the conversation.\n\nAfter half-an-hour's chat, Major Harper delicately alluded to the\nsupposed business on which she had wished to see him, though in a tone\nthat showed him to be rather doubtful whether it existed at all.\n\nAgatha coloured, and her heart quailed a little, as any girl's would,\nin having to speak so openly of things which usually reach young maidens\nsoftly murmured amidst the confessions of first love, or revealed\nby tender parents with blessings and tears. Life's earliest and best\nromance came to her with all its bloom worn away--all its sacredness and\nmystery set aside. For a moment she felt this hard.\n\n\"I wished to inform you of something nearly concerning me, which, as\nthe guardian appointed by my father, it is right you should know. I\nhave had\"--here she tried to make her lips say the words without\nfaltering--\"I have had an offer of marriage.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" stammered out Major Harper, completely thrown off\nhis guard by surprise. A very awkward pause ensued, until, his natural\ngood feeling conquering any other, he said, not without emotion, \"The\nfact of your consulting me shows that this offer is--is not without\ninterest to you. May I ask--is it likely--that I shall have to\ncongratulate you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe rose up slowly, and walked to the window. Whether his sensations were\nmerely those of wounded vanity, or whether he had liked her better than\nhe himself acknowledged, certain it was that Major Frederick Harper was\na good deal moved--so much so, that he succeeded in concealing it. He\ncame back, very kind, subdued, and tender, sat down by her side and took\nher hand.\n\n\"You will not wonder that I am somewhat surprised--nay, affected--by\nthese sudden tidings, viewing you as I have always done in the light of\na--younger sister--or--or a daughter. Your happiness must naturally be\nvery dear to me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" murmured Agatha; and the tears came into her eyes. She felt\nthat she had been somewhat harsh to him; but she felt, too, with great\nthankfulness, that, despite this softening compunction, her heart was\nfree and firm. She had great liking, but not a particle of love, for\nMajor Harper.\n\n\"I trust the--the gentleman you allude to is of a character likely to\nmake you happy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Agatha, for she could only speak in monosyllables.\n\n\"Is he--as your friend and guardian I may ask that question--is he\nof good standing in the world, and in a position to maintain you\ncomfortably?\"\n\n\"I do not know--I have never thought about that,\" she cried, restlessly.\n\"All I know is that he--loves me--that I honour him--that he would take\nme\"--\"out of this misery,\" she was about to say, but stopped, feeling\nthat both the thought and the expression were unworthy Nathanael's\nfuture wife, and unfit to be heard by Nathanael's brother.\n\n\"That he would take me,\" repeated she firmly, \"into a contented and\nhappy home, where I should be made a better woman than I am, and live a\nlife more worthy of myself and of him.\"\n\n\"You must then esteem him very highly?\"\n\n\"I do--more than any man I ever knew.\"\n\nThe Major winced slightly, but quickly recovered himself. \"That is, I\nbelieve, the feeling with which every woman ought to marry. He who\nwins and deserves such an attachment is\"--and he sighed--\"is a happy\nman!--Happier, perhaps, than those who have remained single.\"\n\nAgain there ensued a pause, until Major Harper broke it by saying:\n\n\"There is one more question--the last of all--which, after the\nconfidence you have shown me, I may venture to ask: do I know this\ngentleman?\"\n\nAgatha replied by putting into his hands his brother's letter.\n\nThe moment she had done so she felt remorse for having betrayed her\nlover's confidence by letting any eyes save her own rest on his tender\nwords. Had she loved him as he loved her, she could not possibly have\ndone so; and even now a painful sensation smote her. She would have\nsnatched the letter back, but it was too late.\n\nMajor Harper's eyes had merely skimmed down the page to the signature,\nwhen he threw it from him, crying out vehemently:\n\n\"Impossible! Agatha marry Nathanael--Nathanael marry Agatha!--He is\na boy, a very child! What can he be thinking of? Send his letter\nback--tell him it is utter nonsense! Upon my soul it is!\"\n\nMajor Harper was very shortsighted and inconsiderate when he gave way to\nthis burst of vexation before any woman--still more before such a woman\nas Agatha.\n\nShe let him go on without interruption, but she lifted the letter from\nthe floor, refolded it, and held it tenderly--more tenderly than she\nhad ever until now felt towards it or its writer. Something of the grave\nsweetness belonging to the tie of an affianced wife began to cast its\nshadow over her heart.\n\n\"Major Harper, when you have quite done speaking, perhaps you will sit\ndown and hear what I have to say.\"\n\nStruck by her manner, he obeyed, entreating her pardon likewise, for he\nwas a gentleman, and felt that he had acted very wrongly.\n\n\"Yet surely,\" he began--until, looking at her, something convinced him\nthat his arguments were useless. He stretched out his hand again for the\nletter, but with a slight gesture which expressed much, Agatha withheld\nit. After a pause, he said, meekly enough, as if thoroughly overcome by\ncircumstances,--\"So, it is quite true? You really love my brother?\"\n\n\"I honour him, as I said, more than I do any man.\"\n\n\"And love him--are you sure you love him?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she answered, deeply blushing--\"No one but himself has a right\nto receive the answer to that question.\"\n\n\"True, true. Pardon me once more. But I am so startled, absolutely\namazed. My brother Nathanael--he that was a baby when I was a grown\nman--he to marry--marrying you too--and I----Well; I suppose I am really\ngrowing into a miserable, useless old bachelor. I have thrown away\nmy life: I shall be the last apple left on the tree--and a tolerably\nwithered one too. But no matter. The world shall see the sunny half of\nme to the last.\"\n\nHe laughed rather tunelessly at his own bitter jest, and after a brief\nsilence, recovered his accustomed manner.\n\n\"So so; such things must be, and I, though a bachelor myself, have no\nright to forbid marriages. Allow me to congratulate you. Of course you\nhave answered this letter? My brother knows his happiness?\"\n\n\"He knows nothing; but I wished that he should do so to-day, after I\nhad spoken to you. It was a respect I felt to be your due, to form no\nengagement of this kind without your knowledge.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said in a low voice.\n\n\"You have been good and kind to me,\" continued Agatha, a little touched,\n\"and I wished to have your approval in all things--chiefly in this. Is\nit so?\"\n\nHe offered his hand, saying, \"God bless you!\" with a quivering lip. He\neven muttered \"child;\" as though he felt how old he was growing, and\nhow he had let all life's happiness slip by, until it was just that he\nshould no longer claim it, but be content to see young people rejoicing\nin their youth. After a pause, he added, \"Now, shall I go and fetch my\nbrother?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Agatha, \"send for him, and do you stay here.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said Major Harper, a good deal surprised at this very\noriginal way of conducting a love affair. After courteously offering to\nwithdraw himself to the dining-room, which Agatha declined, he sat and\nwaited with her during the few minutes that elapsed before his brother\nappeared.\n\nNathanael looked much agitated; his boyish face seemed to have grown\nyears older since the preceding night. He paused at the door, and\nglanced with suspicion on his brother and Miss Bowen.\n\n\"You sent for me, Frederick?\"\n\n\"It was I who sent for you,\" said Agatha. And then steadfastly regarding\nhim whom she had tacitly accepted as her husband, the guide and ruler\nof her whole life--her self-possession failed. A great timidity,\nalmost amounting to terror, came over her. Vaguely she felt the want of\nsomething unknown--something which in the whirl of her destiny she could\ngrasp and hold by, sure that she held fast to the right. It was the one\nemotion, neither regard, liking, honour, or esteem, yet including and\nsurpassing all--the _love_, strong, pure love, without which it is so\ndangerous, often so fatal, for a woman to marry.\n\nAgatha, never having known this feeling, could scarcely be said to have\nsacrificed it; at least not consciously. But even while she believed she\nwas doing right in accepting the man who loved her, and whom she could\nmake so happy, she trembled.\n\nMajor Harper sat looking out of the window in an uncomfortable silence,\nwhich he evidently knew not how to break. It was a very awkward and\nsomewhat ridiculous position for all three.\n\nNathanael was the first to rise out of it. Slowly his features settled\ninto composure, and his strong, earnest purpose gave him both dignity\nand calmness, even though all hope had evidently died. He looked\nsteadily at his brother, avoiding Agatha.\n\n\"Frederick, I think I understand now. She has been telling you all.\"\n\n\"It was right she should. Her father left her in my care. She wishes you\nto learn her decision in my presence,\" said Major Harper, unwittingly\ntaking a new and even respectful tone to the younger brother, whom he\nwas wont to call \"that boy.\"\n\nNathanael grasped with his slight, long fingers, the chair by which he\nstood. \"As she pleases. I am quite ready. Still--if--yesterday--without\ntelling you or any one--she had said to me--But I am quite ready to hear\nwhat she decides.\"\n\nDespite his firmness, the words were uttered slowly and with a great\nstruggle.\n\n\"Tell him everything, Miss Bowen; it will come better from yourself,\"\nsaid Frederick Harper, rising.\n\nAgatha rose likewise, walked across the room, and laid her hand in that\nof him who loved her. The only words she said were so low that he alone\ncould hear them:\n\n\"I have been very desolate--be kind to me!\"\n\nNathanael made no answer; indeed for the moment his look was that of a\nman bewildered--but he never forgot those words.\n\nAgatha felt her hand clasped--softly--but with a firm grasp that seemed\nto bind it to his for ever. This was the only sign of betrothal that\npassed between them. In another minute or two, unable to bear the scene\nlonger, she crept out of the room and walked up-stairs, feeling with\na dizzy sense, half of comfort, half of fear--yet, on the whole, the\ncomfort stronger than the fear--that the struggle was all over, and her\nfate sealed for life.\n\nWhen she descended, an hour after, the Harpers had gone; but she found a\nlittle note awaiting her, just one line:\n\n\"If not forbidden, I may come this evening.\"\n\nAgatha knew she had no right to forbid, even had she wished it, now. So\nshe waited quietly through the long, dim, misty day--which seemed the\nstrangest day she had ever known; until, in the evening, her lover's\nknock came to the door.\n\nShe was sitting with Jane Ianson, near whom, partly in shy fear, partly\nfrom a vague desire for womanly sympathy, she had closely kept for the\nlast hour. As yet, the Iansons knew nothing. She wondered whether from\nhis manner or hers they would be likely to guess what had passed that\nmorning between herself and Mr. Harper.\n\nIt was an infinite relief to her when following, nay preceding,\nNathanael, there appeared his elder brother, with the old pleasant smile\nand bow.\n\nBut amidst all his assumed manner, Major Harper took occasion to whisper\nkindly to Agatha; \"My brother made me come--I shall do admirably to talk\nnonsense to the Iansons.\"\n\nAnd so he did, carrying off the restraint of the evening so ingeniously\nthat no one would have suspected any deeper elements of joy or pain\nbeneath the smooth surface of their cheerful group.\n\nNathanael sat almost as silent as ever; but even his very silence was\na beautiful, joyful repose. In his aspect a new soul seemed to have\ndawned--the new soul, noble and strong, which comes into a man when he\nfeels that his life has another life added to it, to guard, cherish, and\nkeep as his own until death. And though Mr. Harper gave little outward\nsign of what was in him, it was touching to see how his eyes followed\nhis betrothed everywhere, whether she were moving about the room, or\nworking, or trying to sing. Continually Agatha felt the shining of\nthese quiet, tender eyes, and she began to experience the\nconsciousness--perhaps the sweetest in the world--of being able to make\nanother human being entirely happy.\n\nOnly sometimes, when she looked at her future husband--hardly able\nto believe he was really such--and thought how strangely things had\nhappened; how here she was, no longer a girl, but a woman engaged to\nbe married, sitting calmly by her lover's side, without any of the\ntremblingly delicious emotions which she had once believed would\nconstitute the great mystery, Love--a strange pensiveness overtook her.\nShe felt all the solemnity of her position, and, as yet, little of its\nsweetness. Perhaps that would come in time. She resolved to do her\nduty towards him whom she so tenderly honoured, and who so deeply loved\nherself; and all the evening the entire gentleness of her behaviour\nwas enough to charm the very soul of any one who held towards her the\nrelation now borne by Nathanael Harper.\n\nAt length even the good-natured elder brother's flow of conversation\nseemed to fail, and he gave hints about leaving, to which the younger\ntacitly consented. Agatha bade them both good-night in public, and crept\naway, as she thought, unobserved, to her own sitting-room.\n\nThere she stood before the hearth, which looked cheerful enough this\nwet July night,--the fire-light shining on her hands, as they hung down\nlistlessly folded together. She was thinking how strange everything\nseemed about her, and what a change had come in a few days, nay, hours.\n\nSuddenly a light touch was laid on her hand. It startled her, but she\ndid not attempt to shake it off. She knew quite well whose hand it was,\nand that it had a right to be there.\n\n\"Agatha!\"\n\nShe half turned, and said once more \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"Good-night, _my_ Agatha.\"\n\nAnd for a minute he stood, holding her hand by the fire-light, until\nsome one below called out loudly for \"Mr. Harper.\" Then a kiss, soft and\ntimid as a woman's, trembled over Agatha's mouth, and he was gone.\n\nThis was the first time she had ever been kissed by any man. The feeling\nit left was very new, tremulous, and strange.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nThe next morning was Sunday. Under one of the dark arches in Bloomsbury\nChurch--with Mrs. Ianson's large feathers tossing on one side, and\nJane's sickly unhappy face at the other--Agatha said her prayers in due\nsabbatical form. \"Said her prayers\" is the right phrase, for trouble\nhad not yet opened her young heart to pray. Yet she was a good girl, not\nwilfully undevout; and if during the long missionary-sermon she secretly\ngot her prayer-book and read--what was the most likely portion to\nattract her--the marriage service, it was with feelings solemnised\nand not unsacred. Some portions of it made her very thoughtful, so\nthoughtful that when suddenly startled by the conclusion of the sermon,\nshe prayed--not with the clergyman, for \"Jews, Turks, Infidels, and\nHeretics\"--but for two young creatures, herself and another, who perhaps\nneeded Heaven's merciful blessings quite as much.\n\nWhen she rose up it was with moist eyelashes; and then she perceived\nwhat until this minute she had not seen,--that close behind her, sitting\nwhere he had probably sat all church-time, was Nathanael Harper.\n\nIf anything can touch the heart of a generous woman, when it is still\na free heart, it is that quiet, unobtrusive, proudly-silent love which,\ngiving all, exacts nothing. Agatha's smile had in it something even of\nshy tenderness when at the church-door she was met by Mr. Harper.\nAnd when, after speaking courteously to the Iansons, he came, quite\nnaturally as it were, to her side, and drew her arm in his, she felt\na strange sense of calm and rest in knowing that it was her betrothed\nhusband upon whom she leant.\n\nAt the door he seemed wishful enough to enter; but Mrs. Ianson\ninvariably looked very coldly upon Sunday visitors.\n\nAnd something questioning and questionable in the glances of both that\nlady and her daughter was very painful to Miss Bowen.\n\n\"Not to-day,\" she whispered, as her lover detained her hand. \"To-morrow\nI shall have made all clear to the Iansons.\"\n\n\"As you will! Nothing shall trouble you,\" said he, with a gentle\nacquiescence, the value of which, alas! she did not half appreciate.\n\"Only, remember, I have so few to-morrows.\"\n\nThis speech troubled Agatha for many minutes, bringing various thoughts\nconcerning the dim future which as yet she had scarcely contemplated.\nIt is wonderful how little an unsophisticated girl's mind rests on the\ncommon-sense and commonplace of marriage,--household prospects, income,\nlong or short engagements, and the like. When in the course of that\ndrowsy, dark Sunday afternoon, with the rain-drops dripping heavily on\nthe balcony, she took opportunity formally to communicate her secret to\nthe astonished Mrs. Ianson, Agatha was perfectly confounded by the two\nsimple questions: \"When are you to be married? And where are you going\nto live?\"\n\n\"And oh! my dear,\" cried the doctor's wife, roused into positive\nsympathy by a confidence which always touches the softest chord in every\nwoman's heart--\"oh, my dear, I hope it will not be a long engagement.\nPeople change so--at least men do. You don't know what misery comes out\nof long engagements!\" And, lowering her voice, she turned her dull grey\neyes, swimming with motherly tears, towards the corner sofa where the\npale, fretful, old-maidish Jane lay sleeping.\n\nAgatha understood a little, and guessed more. After that day, however\nill-tempered and disagreeable the invalid might be, she was always very\npatient and kind towards Jane Ianson.\n\nAfter tea, when her daughter was gone to bed, Mrs. Ianson unfolded\nall to the Doctor, who nearly broke Miss Bowen's fingers with his\ncongratulatory shake; John the footman, catching fragments of talk,\nprobably put the whole story together for the amusement of the lower\nregions; and when Agatha retired to rest she was quite sure that the\nwhole house, down to the little maid who waited on herself, was fully\naware of the important fact that Miss Bowen was going to be married to\nMr. Locke Harper.\n\nThis annoyed her--she had not expected it. But she bore it stoically as\na necessary evil. Only sometimes she thought how different all things\nwere, seen afar and near; and faintly sighed for that long ago lost\npicture of wakening fancy--the Arcadian, impossible love-dream.\n\nShe sat up till after midnight, writing to Emma Thorny-croft, the\nonly near friend to whom she had to write, the news of her\nengagement--information that for many reasons she preferred giving\nby pen, not words. Finishing, she put her blind aside to have one\nfreshening look at the trees in the square. It was quite cloudless now,\nthe moon being just rising--the same moon that Agatha had seen, as a\nbright slender line appearing at street corners, on the Midsummer night\nwhen she and Nathariael Harper walked home together. She felt a deep\ninterest in that especial moon, which seemed between its dawning and\nwaning to have comprised the whole fate of her life.\n\nQuietly opening the window, she leant out gazing at the moonlight, as\nfoolish girls will--yet who does not remember, half pathetically, those\ndear old follies!\n\n\"Heigho! I wonder what will be the end of it all!\" said Agatha Bowen;\nwithout specifying what the pronoun \"it\" alluded to.\n\nBut she stopped, hearing a footstep rather policeman-like passing up and\ndown the railing under the trees. And as after a while he crossed the\nstreet--she saw that the \"policeman\" had the very unprofessional\nappearance of a cloak and long fair hair:--Agatha's cheek burned; she\nshut down the window and blind, and relighted the candle. But her heart\nbeat fast--it was so strange, so new, to be the object of such love.\n\"However, I suppose I shall get used to it--besides--oh, how good he\nis!\"\n\nAnd the genuine reverence of her heart conquered its touch of feminine\nvanity; which, perhaps, had he known.\n\nNathanael would have done wiser in going to bed like a Christian, than\nin wandering like a heathen idolater round his beloved's shrine. But,\nhowever her pride may have been flattered, it is certain that Agatha\nwent to sleep with tears, innocent and tender enough to serve as mirrors\nfor watching night-angels, lying on her cheek.\n\nThe next morning she waited at home, and for the first time received\nher betrothed openly as such. She was sitting alone in her little\ndrawing-room engaged at her work; but put it down when Mr. Harper\nentered, and held out her hand kindly, though with a slight restraint\nand confusion. Both were needless: he only touched this lately-won\nhand with his soft boyish lips--like a _preux chevalier_ of the olden\ntime--and sat down by her side. However deep his love might be, its\nreserve was unquestionable.\n\nAfter a while he began to talk to her--timidly yet tenderly, as friend\nwith friend--watching her fingers while they moved, until at length the\ngirl grew calmed by the calmness of her young lover. So much so, that\nshe even forgot he was a young man and her lover, and found herself\noften steadfastly looking up into his face, which was gradually melting\ninto a known likeness, as many faces do when we grow familiar with them.\nAgatha puzzled herself much as to who it could be that Mr. Harper was\nlike--though she found no nearer resemblance than a head she had once\nseen of the angel Gabriel.\n\nShe told him this--quite innocently, and then, recollecting herself,\ncoloured deeply. But Nathanael looked perfectly happy.\n\n\"The likeness is very flattering,\" said he, smiling. \"Yet I would only\nwish to be--what you called me once, the first evening I saw you. Do you\nremember?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ah--well--it was not probable you should,\" he answered, as if\npatiently taking upon himself the knowledge which only a strong love can\nbear--that it is _alone_ in its strength. \"It was merely when they were\ntalking of my name, and you said I looked like a Nathanael. Now, do you\nremember?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I think so still,\" she replied, without any false shame. \"I\nnever look at you, but I feel there is 'no guile' in you, Mr. Harper.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, with much feeling. \"Thanks--except for the last word.\nHow soon will you try to say 'Nathanael?'\"\n\nA fit of wilfulness or shyness was upon Agatha. She drew away her hand\nwhich he had taken. \"How soon? Nay, I cannot tell. It is a long name,\nold-fashioned, and rather ugly.\"\n\nHe made no answer--scarcely even showed that he was hurt; but he never\nagain asked her to call him \"Nathanael.\"\n\nShe went on with her work, and he sat quietly looking at her for some\nlittle time more. Any Asmodeus peering at them through the roof would\nhave vowed these were the oddest pair of lovers ever seen.\n\nAt last, rousing himself, Mr. Harper said: \"It is time, Agatha\"--he\npaused, and added--\"dear Agatha--quite time that we should talk a\nlittle about what concerns our happiness--at least mine.\"\n\nShe looked at him--saw how earnest he was, and put down her work. The\nsoftness of her manner soothed him.\n\n\"I know, dear Agatha, that it is very wrong in me; but sometimes I can\nhardly believe this is all true, and that you really promised--what I\nheard from your own lips two days ago. Will you--out of that good heart\nof yours--say it again?\"\n\n\"What must I say?\"\n\n\"That you love--no, I don't mean that--but that you care for me a\nlittle--enough to trust me with your happiness? Do you?\"\n\nFor all reply, Agatha held out the hand she had drawn back. Her lover\nkept it tight in that peculiar grasp of his--very soft and still, but\nfirm as adamant.\n\n\"Thank you. You shall never regret your trust. My brother told me all\nyou said to him on Saturday morning. I know you do not quite love me\nyet.\"\n\nAgatha started, it was so true.\n\n\"Still, as you have loved no one else--you are sure of that?\"\n\nShe thought a minute, then lifted her candid eyes, and answered:\n\n\"Yes, quite sure!\"\n\nHe, watching her closely, betrayed himself so far as to give an inward\nthankful sigh.\n\n\"Then, Agatha, since I love you, I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" she answered, and a tear fell, for she was greatly moved. Her\nbetrothed put his arm round her, softly and timidly, as if unfamiliar\nwith actions of tenderness; but she trembled so much that, still softly,\nhe let her go, only keeping firm hold of her hand, apparently to show\nthat no power on earth, gentle or strong, should wrest that from him.\n\nA few minutes after, he began speaking of his affairs, of which Agatha\nwas in a state of entire ignorance. She said, jestingly--for they had\nfallen into quite familiar jesting now, and were laughing together like\na couple of children--that she had not the least idea whether she were\nabout to marry a prince or a beggar.\n\n\"No,\" answered her lover, smiling at her unworldliness, and thereby\nbetraying that, innocent as he looked, his was not the innocence of\nignorance. \"No; but I am not exactly a prince, and as a beggar I should\ncertainly be too proud to marry _you_.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Why?\"\n\n\"Because I understand you are a very rich young lady (I don't know\nhow rich, for I never thought of the subject or inquired about it till\nto-day), while I am only able to earn my income year by year. Yet it is\na good income, and, I earnestly hope, fully equal to yours.\"\n\n\"I don't know what mine is. But why are you so punctilious?\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian, impressed upon me, from my boyhood, that one of the\ngreatest horrors of life must be the taunt of having married an heiress\nfor her money.\"\n\n\"Has he ever married?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And is he a very old man?\" Miss Bowen asked, less interested in money\nmatters than in this Uncle Brian, whose name so constantly floated\nacross his nephew's conversation.\n\n\"Fifteen years in the colonies makes a man old before his time. And he\nwas not very young, probably full thirty, when he went out But I could\ngo on talking of Uncle Brian for ever; you must stop me, Agatha.\"\n\n\"Not I--I like to hear,\" she answered, beginning to feel how sweet it\nwas to sit talking thus confidentially, and know herself and her words\nesteemed fair and pleasant in the eyes of one who loved her. But as she\nlooked up and smiled, that same witching smile put an effectual stop to\nthe chronicle of Brian Harper.\n\n\"And I have to go back to Canada so soon!\" whispered Nathanael to\nhimself, as his gaze, far less calm than heretofore, fell down like a\nwarm sunshine over his betrothed, \"The time of my stay here will soon be\nover, and what then--Agatha?\"\n\nShe did not wholly comprehend the question, and so let it pass. She was\nquite content to keep him talking about things and people in whom her\ninterest was naturally growing; of Kingcombe Holm, the old house on the\nDorset coast, where the Harpers had dwelt for centuries; of its present\nowner, Nathanael Harper, Esquire, of that venerable name so renowned in\nDorsetshire pedigrees, that one Harper had refused to merge it even in\nthe blaze of a peerage. Of the five Miss Harpers, of whom one was dead,\nand another, the all-important \"married sister,\" Mrs. Dugdale, lived in\na town close by. Of Eulalie, the pretty _cadette_ who was at some\nfuture time going to disappear behind the shadows of matrimony; of\nbusy, housekeeping Mary, whom nobody could possibly do without, and who\ncouldn't be suffered to marry on any account whatever. Last of all, was\nthe eye, ear, and heart of the house, kept tenderly in its inmost nook,\nfrom which for twenty years she had never moved, and never would move\nuntil softly carried to the house appointed for all living--Elizabeth,\nthe eldest--of whom Nathanael's soft voice grew softer as he spoke. His\nbetrothed hesitated to ask many questions about Elizabeth. The one of\nwhom she had it in her mind always to inquire, and whose name somehow\nalways slipped past, was Miss Anne Valery.\n\nAll this conversation--wherein the young lover bore himself much more\nbravely than in regular \"love-making\"--a manufacture at which he was not\n_au fait_ at all, caused the morning to pass swiftly by. Agatha thought\nif all her life were to move so smoothly and pleasantly, she need never\nrepent trusting its current to the guidance of Nathanael Harper. And\nwhen, soon after he departed, Emma Thorny-croft came in, all smiles,\nwonderings, and congratulations, Miss Bowen was in a mood cheerful\nenough to look the happy _fianc\u00c3\u00a9e_ to the life; besides womanly and\ntender enough to hang round her friend's neck, testifying her old\nregard--until Master James testified his also, and likewise his general\nsympathy in the scene, by flying at them both with bread-and-buttery\nfingers.\n\n\"Ah, Agatha, there is nothing like being a wife and mother! you see what\nhappiness lies before you,\" cried the affectionate soul, hugging her\nunruly son and heir.\n\nMiss Bowen slightly shuddered; being of a rather different opinion;\nwhich, however, she had the good taste to keep to herself, since\noccasionally a slight misgiving arose that either she was unreasonably\nharsh, or that the true type of infantile loveableness did not exist in\nthe young Thornycrofts.\n\nAs a private penance for possible injustice, and also out of the general\nsunniness of her contented heart, she was particularly kind to Master\nJames that day, and moreover promised to spend the next at the Botanic\nGardens--not the terrific Zoological!--with Emma and the babies.\n\n\"And,\" added the young matron, with a gracious satisfaction, \"you\nunderstand, my dear, we shall--now and always--be most happy to see Mr.\nHarper in the evening.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nWhether Mr. Harper, being a rather proud and reserved individual, was\nnot \"so happy to be seen in the evening\" as an attendant planet openly\nfollowing his sphered idol, or whether, like all true lovers, he was\nvery jealous over the lightest public betrayal of love's sanctity, most\ncertainly he did not appear until he had been expected for at least two\nhours. Even then his manner was somewhat constrained. Emma's smiling,\nhalf-jesting congratulations were nipped in the bud; she felt as she\nafterwards declared--\"quite frightened at him.\"\n\nAgatha, too, met him rather meekly, fearing lest she had led him into\na position distasteful to his feelings. She was relieved when,\ntaking little notice of herself, he fell into conversation with Mr.\nThornycroft--a serious discussion on political and general topics. Once\nor twice, glancing at him, and noticing how well he talked, and how\nmanly and self-possessed he looked, Agatha began to feel proud of her\nbetrothed. She could not have endured a lover who--in not unfrequent\nlover-like fashion--\"made a fool of himself\" on her account.\n\nWhile the two gentlemen still talked, Miss Bowen stood secretly\nlistening, but apparently watching the rich twilight that coloured the\nlong sweep of the Regent's Park trees--a pretty sight, even though in\nthe land of Cockayne.\n\n\"There's a carriage at our door!\" screamed Missy from the balcony,\nreceiving a hurried maternal reproof for ill-behaviour. Mrs. Thornycroft\nwondered who the inopportune visitor could be.\n\nIt was a lady, who gave no name, but wished to know if Mr. Locke Harper\nwere there, and if so, would he come to the carriage and speak to her a\nmoment?\n\nNathanael did so, looking not less surprised than the rest of the party.\nAfter five minutes had elapsed, he was still absent from the room.\n\n\"Very odd!\" observed Emma, half in jest, half earnest; \"I should inquire\ninto the matter if I were you. Let me see--I fancy the carriage is still\nat the door. It would be rude to peep, you know, but we can inquire of\nthe maid.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Agatha, gently removing Mrs. Thornycrofts hand from the\nbell; \"Mr. Harper will doubtless tell me all that is necessary. He is\nperfectly able to conduct his own affairs.\"\n\nIt was speech implying more indifference than she really felt, for this\nmysterious interview did not quite please her. She tried vainly to go on\ntalking with Mrs. Thornycroft, and actually started when she heard the\ncarriage drive off, and Nathanael come up-stairs.\n\nHis countenance was a good deal troubled, but he did not give the\nslightest explanation--not even when Mrs. Thornycroft joked him about\nhis supposed \"business.\"\n\n\"With a lady, too! Not, I hope, a young lady?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\" he asked, absently, his eyes fixed afar off on\nAgatha.\n\n\"I hope your visitor in the carriage was not a young lady?\"\n\n\"No.\" The answer was in a tone that put an end to any more jesting.\n\nNathanael sat down, and tried to take up the thread of politics just\ndropped with Mr. Thornycroft, but only for a few minutes. Then, stealing\nround by Miss Bowen's side, he whispered:\n\n\"I want to speak to you: would you mind coming home soon?\"\n\n\"At once, if you wish it,\" she answered, perceiving that something was\nwrong, and feeling towards him too much of kindness and too little of\njealous love, to be in any way displeased at his strange behaviour.\n\n\"Will you do it, then, dear Agatha? Do it for me.\"\n\nAgatha was ill at contrivance, but she managed somehow to get away; and\nbefore it was dark she and her betrothed were out in the broad terrace.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, taking his arm kindly, \"if anything is amiss, you can\ntell me all as we walk home. Better walk than ride.\"\n\n\"No, we must ride; I would not lose a minute,\" Nathanael answered, as\nhe hurried her into a conveyance, and gave the order to drive to Bedford\nSquare.\n\nMiss Bowen felt a twinge of repugnance at this control so newly\nexercised over the liberty of her actions; but her good-heartedness\nstill held out, and she waited patiently for her lover to explain.\nHowever, he seemed to forget that any explanation was necessary. He\nleaned back in the corner quite silent, with his hand over his eyes.\nHad she loved him, or not known that he was her lover, Agatha would soon\nhave essayed the womanly part of comforter, but now timidity restrained\nher.\n\nAt length timidity was verging into distrust, when he suddenly said,\njust as they were entering the square:\n\n\"I have used the dear right you lately gave me, in taking a strange\nliberty with you and your house. I have appointed to meet me there\nto-night one whom I must see, and whom I could not well see in any other\nway--a lady--a stranger to you. But, stay, she is here!\"\n\nAnd as they stopped at the door, where another carriage had stopped\nlikewise, Nathanael unceremoniously leaped out, and went to this\n\"mysterious stranger.\"\n\n\"Go in, dear Agatha,\" said he returning; \"go to your own sitting-room,\nand I will bring her to you.\"\n\nAgatha, half reluctant to be so ordered about, and thoroughly bewildered\nlikewise, mechanically obeyed. Nevertheless, with a sort of pleasure\nthat this humdrum courtship was growing into something interesting at\nlast, she waited for the intruding \"lady.\"\n\nThat she was a lady, the first glimpse of her as she entered the\nroom leaning rather heavily on Nathanael's arm, brought sufficient\nconviction. She was tall, and a certain slow, soft way of moving,\ncast about her an atmosphere of sweet dignity. Her age was not easily\ndistinguishable, but her voice, in the few words addressed to Mr.\nHarper, \"Is your friend here?\" seemed not that of a very young woman.\n\nIn her presence, Miss Bowen instinctively rose.\n\n\"Yes, she is here,\" said Nathanael, answering the stranger. \"You could\nnot have learnt what I wrote yesterday to my father and to Elizabeth.\nShe is Agatha Bowen, my--my wife that will be. Agatha, this lady is Miss\nAnne Valery.\"\n\nIt would be hard to say which of the two thus suddenly introduced to\neach other was most surprised. However, the elder lady recovered herself\nsoonest.\n\n\"I was not aware of this; but I am very glad. And I need not now\napologise for thus intruding.\"\n\nShe went up to the young betrothed, and took her by the hand warmly,\nseeming at once and without further explanation to comprehend all; while\non Agatha's side, her look, her voice, her touch, communicated a sudden\ntrust and pleasure. It was one of those instinctive, inexplicable\nattractions which almost every one has experienced more or less during\nlife. She could not take her eyes off Miss Valery; the face and manner\nseemed at once familiar and strange. She had never been so impressed by\nany woman before.\n\nTo show all hospitable attentions, to place an arm-chair for her guest,\nand even, as she appeared weary, to entreat her to put aside her bonnet\nand mantle--seemed quite natural to Miss Bowen, just as if they had\nbeen friends of years. Anne thanked her courteously, let her do what she\nwould--but all the while looked anxiously at Nathanael.\n\n\"You know we have much to say. Is she aware of what I told you?\"\n\n\"Not yet; I could not tell her; it shocked me so. Oh, my poor uncle!\"\n\nAgatha, who was unfastening her guest's cloak, turned round.\n\n\"What, your Uncle Brian? Has anything happened? You speak almost as if\nhe were dead.\"\n\nAnne Valery shivered.\n\n\"Dead! God forbid!\" cried the young man, more deeply moved than his\nbetrothed had ever seen him. \"But we have had ill news. He went as\ninterpreter on a Government mission, as he had often done before; he was\nso popular among the Indians. But from some treachery shown them, the\ntribe grew enraged and carried him off prisoner. Heaven only knows if\nthey have spared his life. But I think--I feel they will. He was so just\nto the red men always. He is surely safe.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is safe,\" repeated Miss Valery, as if any alternative but that\nwere utterly incredible and impossible.\n\nNathanael continued: \"The tidings reached Kingcombe yesterday, and our\nfriend here, coming to London, volunteered to bring them, and consult\nwith me. If there is any good deed to be done, it is sure to be done by\nAnne Valery,\" added Nathanael, stretching out his hand to hers.\n\nShe took it without speaking, being apparently much exhausted. And now\nthat her bonnet was off, and she sitting near the lamp, Agatha discerned\nthat Miss Valery was by no means young or beautiful. At all events, she\nwas at that time in an unmarried woman's life when it ceases to signify\nwhether she is handsome or not. Her hair at first seemed brown, but on\nlooking closer, there appeared on either side the parting broad silvery\nlines, as if two snow-laden hands laid on the head had smoothed it down,\nleaving it shining still.\n\nAgatha turned from her passing examination of Miss Valery to the subject\nin question, evidently so painful to her betrothed.\n\n\"You two wish to consult together? Do so. Pray stay here. I am very\nsorry for your trouble, Mr. Harper. Anything that I can do for you or\nyour friend, you know\"--and her voice dropped softly--\"it is my duty\nnow.\"\n\nNathanael looked at her, as if longing to clasp her to his heart and\nsay how happy he was; but he restrained himself and let his eyes alone\ndeclare what he felt. They were very eloquent.\n\nWhile this passed between the young people, the elder lady arose from\nher chair; quietness seemed painful to her.\n\n\"Nathanael, every minute is precious to anxiety such as you must feel.\nHave you thought what had better be done, since you are the right person\nto do it?\"\n\n\"As yet I have thought of nothing. And, alas! what _can_ be done?\"\n\n\"Sit down, and let us consider,\" said she, laying her hand on his, with\na force soft yet steady as that of her words.\n\nAgatha was gliding out of the room, but her lover's quick movement and\nMiss Valery's look stopped her.\n\n\"Do not go, Miss Bowen; you are not so unknown to me as I am to you. I\nhad much rather you stayed.\"\n\nSo she took up her position a little distance off, and listened while\nthe two friends consulted; pondering the while on what a rare kind of\nman Mr. Brian Harper must be to win such regard.\n\n\"You say the news came accidentally?\" Mr. Harper observed. \"It may not\nbe true, then.\"\n\n\"It is. I had it confirmed to-day.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I went to the Colonial Office myself.\" (\"Kind Anne Valery!\" murmured\nthe young man.) \"It was best to do so before I told you anything. You,\nknowing the whole facts, would then decide more readily.\"\n\n\"You are right and wise as ever. Now, tell me exactly what you heard.\"\n\n\"While a treaty was going forward for the Government purchase of Indian\nlands, there arose a quarrel, and two red men were upon slight grounds\npunished cruelly. Then the whole tribe went off in the night, carrying\nas prisoners two Englishmen--one by force. The other is believed to have\noffered himself willingly as a hostage, until the reparation of what he\nconsidered an injustice shown by his countrymen to the Indians. You may\nguess who he was.\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian, of course,\" cried Nathanael, pacing the room. \"Just like\nhim! He would do the maddest things for the sake of honour.\"\n\nAnne Valery's eyes flashed in the dark a momentary brightness, as if\nthey were growing young again.\n\n\"But his life is surely safe: all over the Indian country they respect\nthe very name of Brian Harper. No harm can touch him--it is quite\nimpossible!\"\n\n\"I think so too.\" And Miss Valery drew a long breath. \"Still, such\ndanger is very terrible--is it not?\" And she turned slightly, to include\nAgatha in their conversation.\n\n\"Oh, terrible!\" the girl cried, deeply interested. \"But could he not\nbe sought for--rescued? Could not a party be despatched after him? If I\nwere a man I would head one immediately.\"\n\nMiss Valery, faintly smiling, patted Agatha's hand. It was easy to\nsee that this good heart opened itself at once to Nathanael's young\nbetrothed.\n\n\"That is what I had in my own mind, and should have spoken of to his\nnephew here--a party of search which the Canadian Government, if urged,\nwould no doubt consent to. Nathanael could propose it--plan it. He is\nboth ingenious and wise.\"\n\n\"Ah, he is; he seems to know everything!\" cried Agatha warmly. \"Surely,\nMr. Harper, you could think of something--do something?\"\n\n\"I could,\" said the nephew, slowly waking from a long interval of\nthought. \"I could do--what perhaps I ought, and will--for him who has\nbeen more than a father to me.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" Agatha asked, while Miss Valery regarded him silently.\n\n\"To go back to America--head a search; or, if that is refused me, search\nfor him myself alone, and never give up until I find him--living or\ndead.\"\n\n\"Ah, do so! that will be right, generous, noble--you could not fail.\"\n\n\"There is no saying, Agatha; only, if done, it must be done without\ndelay. I must start at once--in a week--nay a day--leaving England,\nhome, you, everything. That is hard!\"\n\nHe uttered the last words inaudibly, and his left hand was suddenly\nclenched, as he turned and walked once up the room and down again.\n\nAgatha knew not what to say. Only a great love conscious of the extent\nof its own sacrifice, would have had boldness to urge the like sacrifice\nupon him.\n\nMiss Valery's voice broke the troubled pause:\n\n\"You cannot start yet, Nathanael; you would have to apply to the\nGovernment here. It would be impossible for you to leave under at least\na fortnight.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he sighed, momentarily relieved, which was but natural \"Yet, how\nwrong I am! for my poor uncle's sake I ought not to lose a day. Surely\nthere would be some way of hastening the time, if inquiries were to be\nset on foot.\"\n\n\"I have made all that could be made; still, try yourself, though I fear\nit is useless. The suspense is bitter, but what is inevitable must be\nborne,\" said Anne, with the smile of one long used to the practice of\nthat doctrine. \"And in a fortnight--a fortnight is a long time, Miss\nBowen?\"\n\nThe smile, flitting to Agatha, took a cheerfulness which hitherto in\nthe sad subject of her talk Miss Valery had not displayed. A certain\nbenevolent meaning, which Agatha rather guessed at than discerned, was\nlikewise visible there.\n\n\"Come,\" said she, \"for this night we can do nothing; but having settled\nwhat we shall do, or rather what Mr. Harper will do, let us make\nourselves at rest. Be content, my dear Nathanael. Heaven will take care\nof him for whom we fear.\"\n\nHer voice trembled, Agatha fancied; and the young girl thought how full\nand generous was this kind woman's sympathy! likewise how good Nathanael\nmust be to have awakened so deep a regard in such an one as Miss Anne\nValery.\n\nThe clock struck ten. \"We are early folk in Dorsetshire; but as my\nold servant Andrews has secured my lodgings close by (I am a very\nindependent woman, you see, Miss Bowen), if you will allow me, I should\nlike to sit another half-hour, and become a little better acquainted\nwith you.\"\n\nAgatha gave her a delighted welcome, and astonished the Ianson family\nby ordering all sorts of hospitalities. The three began to converse upon\nvarious matters, the only remarkable fact being that no one inquired for\nor alluded to a person, doubtless familiar to all--Frederick Harper. On\nAgatha's part this omission was involuntary; he had quietly slipped\nout of her thoughts hour by hour and day by day, as her interest in him\nbecame absorbed in others more akin to her true nature.\n\nBut though every one tried to maintain the conversation on indifferent\ntopics, the feelings of at least two out of the three necessarily\ndrew it back to one channel. There they sat, running over the slight\nnothings, probable and improbable, which in hard suspense people count\nup; though still the worst Nathanael seemed to fear was the temporary\nhardship to which his uncle would be exposed.\n\n\"And he is not so young as he used to be. How often have I urged him to\nbe content with his poverty and come home. He _shall_ come home now. If\nonce I get him out of these red fellows' hands, he shall turn his face\nfrom their wild settlements for ever. He can easily do it, even if I\nmust stay in Canada.\"\n\nThe young man looked at his newly-betrothed wife, and looked away again.\nIt was more than he could bear.\n\n\"Agatha,\" said Miss Valery, after a pause, during which she had closely\nobserved both the young people--\"I may call you _Agatha_, for the sake\nof my friend here, may I not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the low answer.\n\n\"Well then, Agatha, shall you and I have a little talk? We need not mind\nthat foolish boy; he was a boy, just so high, when I first knew him. Let\nhim walk up and down the room a little, it will do him good.\"\n\nShe moved to the sofa, and took Agatha by her side.\n\n\"My dear\"--(there was a rare sweetness in the way Miss Valery said the\nusually unsweet words _my dear_)--\"I need not say, what, of course, we\ntwo both think, that she will be a happy woman who marries Nathanael\nHarper.\"\n\nAgatha, with her eyes cast down, looked everything a young girl could be\nexpected to look under the circumstances.\n\n\"Your happiness, as well as your history, is to me not like that of an\nentire stranger. I once knew your father.\"\n\n\"Ah, that accounts for all!\" cried Agatha, delighted to gain this\nconfirmation of her strange impression in favour of Miss Valery. \"When\nwas this, and where was I?\"\n\n\"Neither born nor thought of.\"\n\nAgatha's countenance fell. \"Then of course it was impossible--yet I felt\ncertain--I could even believe so now--that I have seen you before.\"\n\nWhile the girl looked, a quick shadow passed over Anne Valery's still\nfeatures, for the moment entirely changing their expression. But soon\nreturned their ordinary settled calm.\n\n\"We often fancy that strangers' faces are familiar. It is usually held\nto be an omen of future affection. Let me hope that it will prove so\nnow. I have long wished, and am truly glad, heart-glad to see you, my\ndear child.\"\n\nShe bent Agatha's forehead towards her, and kissed it. Gradually her\nlips recovered their colour, and she began to talk again, showing\nherself surprisingly familiar with the monotonous past life of the young\ngirl, and likewise with her present circumstances.\n\n\"How kind of you to take such an interest in me!\" cried Agatha, her\nwonder absorbed in pleasure.\n\n\"It was natural,\" Anne said, rather hastily. \"A woman left orphan\nfrom the cradle as I was, can feel for another orphan. And though my\nacquaintance with your father was too slender to warrant my intruding\nupon you--still I never lost sight of you. Poor child, yours has been a\ndesolate position for so young a girl.\"\n\n\"Ay, very desolate,\" said Agatha; and suddenly the recollection\ncrossed her mind of how doubly she should feel that desolation when her\nbetrothed husband was gone, for how long, no one could tell! A regret\narose, half tenderness, half selfishness; but she deemed it wholly the\nlatter, and so crushed it down.\n\n\"How long have you been engaged to Nathanael?\" asked Miss Valery, in a\nmanner so sweet as entirely to soften the abruptness of the question,\nand win the unhesitating answer.\n\n\"A very short time--only a few days. Yet I seem to have known him for\nyears. Oh, how good he is! how it grieves me to see him so unhappy!\"\nwhispered Agatha, watching his restless movements up and down.\n\n\"It will be a hard trial for him, this parting with you. Men like\nNathanael never love lightly; even sudden passions--and his must have\nbeen rather sudden--in them take root as with the strength of years. I\nam very sorry for the boy.\"\n\nAnd Miss Valery's eyes glistened as they rested on him whom probably\nfrom old habit she thus called.\n\n\"Well, have you done your little mysteries?\" said he, coming up to the\nsofa, with an effort to be gay. \"Have you taken my character to pieces,\nAnne Valery? Remember, if so, I have little enough time to recover it. A\nfortnight will be gone directly.\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\"Come, make room; I _will_ have my place. I _will_ sit beside you,\nAgatha.\"\n\nThere was a sort of desperation in his \"I will\" that indicated a\ngreat change in the reserved, timid youth. Agatha yielded as to an\nirresistible influence, and he placed himself by her side, putting his\narm firmly round her waist, quite regardless of the presence of a third\nperson--though about Anne there was an abiding spirit of love which\nseemed to take under its shadow all lovers, ay, even though she herself\nwere an old maid. But perhaps that was the very reason.\n\n\"I was doing you no harm, Nathanael,\" said she, smiling. \"And I was\nthinking, like you, how soon a fortnight will be gone, and how hard it\nis for you to part from this little girl that loves you.\"\n\nThe inference, so natural, so holy, which Miss Valery had unconsciously\ndrawn, Agatha had not the heart to deny. She knew it was but right that\nshe should love, and be supposed to love, her betrothed husband. And\nlooking at him, his suffering, his strong self-denial, she almost felt\nthat she did really love him, as a wife ought.\n\n\"If,\" said the soft voice of the good angel--\"if you had not known\neach other so short a time, and been so newly betrothed, I should have\nsaid--judging such things by what they were when I was young,\"--here she\nmomentarily paused--\"I should have said, Nathanael, that there was\nonly one course which, as regarded both her and yourself, was wisest,\nkindest, best.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" cried he, eagerly.\n\n\"To do a little sooner what must necessarily have been done soon--to\ntake one another's hands--thus.\"\n\nAgatha felt strong, wild fingers grasping her own; a dizziness came\nover her--she shrank back, crying, \"No, no!\" and hid her face on Miss\nValery's shoulder. Nathanael rose up and walked away.\n\nWhen he returned, it was with his \"good\" aspect, tender and calm.\n\n\"No, Anne, I was wrong even to think of such a thing. Assure her I will\nnever urge it. She is quite right in saying 'No'--What man could expect\nsuch a sacrifice?\"\n\n\"And what woman would deem it such?\" whispered Miss Valery. \"But I\nknow I am a very foolish, romantic old maid, and view these things in\na different light to most people. So, my dear, be quite at rest,\" she\ncontinued, soothing the young creature, who still clung to her. \"No one\nwill urge you in any way; _he_ will not, he is too generous; and I had\nno right even to say what I did, except from my affection for him.\"\n\nShe looked fondly at the young man, as if he had been still a little\nchild, and she saw him in the light of ancient days. These impelled her\nto speak on earnestly.\n\n\"Another reason I had; because I am old, and you two are young. Often,\nit seems as if the whole world--fate, trial, circumstance--were set\nagainst all lovers to make them part. It is a bitter thing when they\npart of their own free will. Accidents of all kinds--change, sorrow,\neven death--may come between, and they may never meet again. Agatha,\nNathanael--believe one who has seen more of life than you--rarely do\nthose that truly love ever attain the happiness of marrying one another.\nOne half the world--the best and noblest half--thirst all their lives\nfor that bliss which you throw away. What, Agatha, crying?\"\n\nAnd she tried to lift up the drooping head, but could not.\n\n\"Nay, dear, I was wrong to grieve you so. Please God, you two may meet\nagain, and marry and be happy, even in this world. Come, Nathanael, you\ncan say all this much better than I. Tell her you will be quite content,\nand wait any number of years. And, as to this parting, it is a right and\nnoble sacrifice of yours; let her see how nobly you will bear it.\"\n\n\"Ay, Agatha, I will,\" said the young lover firmly, as he stood before\nher, half stooping, half kneeling--though not quite kneeling, even then.\nBut his whole manner showed the crumbling away of that clear but icy\nsurface with which nature or habit had enveloped the whole man.\n\nAgatha lifted her head, and looked at him long and earnestly.\n\n\"I will,\" he repeated; \"I promise you I will. Only be content--and in\ntoken that you are so, give me your hand.\"\n\nShe gave him both, and then leaned back again on Miss Valery's shoulder.\n\n\"Tell him--I will go with him--anywhere--at any time--if it will only\nmake him happy.\"\n\nThe same night, when Nathanael and Anne Valery had left her, Agatha sat\nthinking, almost in a dream, yet without either sorrow or dread--that\nall uncertainty was now over--that this day week would be her\nwedding-day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\"I wish, as I stated yesterday, that Miss Bowen's property should be\nsettled entirely upon herself. This is the only course which to my\nthinking can reconcile a man to the humiliation of receiving a large\nfortune with his wife.\"\n\n\"An odd doctrine, truly! Where did you learn it?\" laughed Major Harper,\nwho was pacing the Bedford Square drawing-room with quick, uneasy steps;\nwhile his brother stood very quiet, only looking from time to time at\nthe closed door. It was the Saturday before the marriage; and Agatha's\ntrustee had come to execute his last guardianship of her and her\nproperty. There was lying on a corner-table, pored over by a lawyer-like\nindividual--that formidable instrument, a marriage-settlement.\n\n\"Where did I learn it?\" returned Mr. Harper, smiling. \"Why, where I\nlearned most of my opinions, and everything that is good in me--with\nUncle Brian. Poor Uncle Brian!\" and the smile faded into grave anxiety.\n\n\"Are you really going on that mad expedition?\" said the elder brother,\nwith the air of a man who, being perturbed in his own mind, is ready to\ntake a harsh view of everything.\n\n\"I do not think it mad--and anything short of madness I ought to\nundertake, and shall--for him.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" muttered the other, \"there it is, Brian always made everybody love\nhim.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Nathanael, \"as I said last night to Miss Bowen, I shall\ndo nothing foolishly. We must hold ourselves prepared for the worst;\nstill, if better tidings should come--though that is scarcely possible\nnow--then perhaps\"----\n\n\"You would not go!\" cried Major Harper, eagerly. \"Which would of course\ndelay your marriage. How very much better that would be.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" said the bridegroom, with a piercing look.\n\nFrederick appeared confused, but threw it off with a laugh.\n\n\"Oh, women like a little longer courtship. They are never caught all in\na minute, unless they are quite indifferent as to who catches them. And\neven then--'marry in haste'--you know the proverb--nay, don't be angry,\"\nhe added, as his brother turned abruptly away. \"I was only jesting; and\na happy fellow like you can afford to be laughed at by a miserable old\nbachelor like me.\"\n\nThe momentary annoyance passed. Nathanael was, indeed, too happy to be\nseriously vexed at anything.\n\n\"Still, for some reasons,\" continued Major Harper, \"I wish my fair ward\nwere not becoming my sister in such a terrible hurry. So much to be done\nin one week, and by a man like me who hates the very name of business;\nit is next to impossible but that some things should he slurred and\nhurried over. For instance, there was no time, Grimes said, to draw up\na long deed of settlement, showing precisely where her money was\ninvested.\"\n\n\"I told you I wanted nothing of the kind. I scarcely understand your\nEnglish law. But can it not be stated in plain legal form--a dozen lines\nwould surety; do it--that every farthing Agatha has is settled upon\nherself exclusively from the day she becomes my wife.\"\n\n\"That is done. I--I--in fact, Mr. Grimes had already advised such a\ncourse as being the shortest.\"\n\n\"Then what is the use of saying any more about it?\"\n\n\"But, brother,\" observed Major Harper, in whose manner was perceptible a\ncertain vague uneasiness, \"if--though I assure you Grimes has transacted\nall these matters, and he is a sharp man of business, while I am\nnone--still, if it would be any satisfaction to you to know particulars\nconcerning where Miss Bowen's money is invested\"--\n\n\"In the funds; and to remain there by her father's will, to I think you\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Precisely. It _was_ invested there,\" returned the brother, with an\naccent so light on the past tense that Nathanael, preoccupied with other\nthings than money matters, did not observe it.\n\n\"Well, then, so let it stay. Don't let us talk any more about this\nmatter. I trust entirely to you. To whom should I trust, if not to my\nown brother?\"\n\nAt these hearty words Major Harper's face, quick in every mobile\nexpression of feeling, betrayed much discomposure. He walked the room in\na mood of agitation, compared to which the bridegroom's own restlessness\nwas nothing. Then he went to the farther end of the apartment, and\nhurriedly read over the marriage-settlement.\n\n\"Faugh, Grimes! what balderdash is this?\" he whispered angrily.\n\"Balderdash?--nay, downright lies!\"\n\n\"Drawn up exactly as you desired, and as we arranged, Major Harper,\"\nanswered Mr. Grimes, formally. \"Settling upon the lady and her heirs for\never all her property now in the 'Three per Cent. Consols.'\"\n\n\"Just heavens! and there's not a penny of it there!\"\n\n\"But there will be by the time the marriage is celebrated, or soon\nafter--since you are determined to sell out those shares.\"\n\n\"I wish I could--I wish to Heaven I could!\" cried the poor Major, in a\ndespair that required all the warnings of his legal adviser to smother\nit down, so as to keep their conference private. \"I've been driven\nnearly mad going from broker to broker in the City to-day. I might\nas well attempt to sell out shares in the Elysian Fields as in that\nconfounded Wheal Caroline.\"\n\n\"Fluctuations, my dear sir; mere fluctuations! 'Tis the same in all\nCornish mines. Yet, as I said, both concerning your own little property\nand Miss Bowen's afterwards, I would wish no better investment. I have\nthe greatest confidence in the Wheal Caroline shares.\"\n\n\"Confidence!\" echoed the Major, ruefully. \"But where is my brother's\nconfidence in me, when I tell him?--'Pon my life, I can't tell him!\"\n\n\"There is not the slightest need; I have accurate information from the\nmine, which next week will raise the shares to ten per cent, premium,\nand then, since you are so determined to sell out that most promising\ninvestment\"--\n\n\"I will, as sure as I live. I vow I'll never be trustee to any young\nlady again, as long as my name is Frederick Harper. However, if this\nmust stand\"--and he read from the deed--\"'all property now invested\nin the Three per Cents.'--Oh, oh!\" Major Harper shook his head, with a\ndeep-drawn sigh of miserable irresolution.\n\nYet there lay the parchment, sickening him with its prevaricating if\nnot lying face; and his invisible good angel kept pulling him on one\nside--nay, at last pulled him halfway across the room to where, absorbed\nin a reverie--pardonable under the circumstances--his brother sat.\n\n\"Nathanael, pray get out of that brown study, and have five minutes'\ntalk with me. If you only knew the annoyance I have endured all this\nweek concerning Agatha's fortune! How thankful I shall be to transfer it\nfrom my hands into yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said the lover, rather absently.\n\n\"And I hope it will give you less trouble and more reward than it has\ngiven me,\" continued the elder brother, still anxiously beating about\nthe bush, ere he came to a direct confession. \"I declare, I have been as\nanxious for the young lady's benefit as if I had intended marrying her\nmyself.\"\n\nThe bridegroom's quick, fiery glance showed Major Harper that he had\ngone a little too far, even in privileged jesting.\n\nBut happily Nathanael had heard the door open. He hastily went forward\nand met his bride. With her were Mr. and Mrs. Thornycroft, Dr. and Mrs.\nIanson, and another lady. The latter quickly passed out of the immediate\ncircle, and sat down in a retired corner of the room.\n\nAgatha looked pale and worn out, which was no wonder, considering that\nfor several days she had endured, morning, noon, and night, all the\nwearisome preparations which the kind-hearted Emma deemed indispensable\nto \"a really nice wedding.\" But her betrothed noticed her paleness with\ntroubled eyes.\n\n\"You are not ill, my darling?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Agatha, abruptly, blushing lest any one should hear the\ntender word, which none had ever used to her before, and blushing still\ndeeper when, meeting Major Harper's anxious looks fixed on them both,\nshe fancied he had heard. A foolish sensitiveness made her turn away\nfrom her lover, and talk to the first person who came in her way.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Thornycroft and Dr. Ianson, with a knowledge that time was\nprecious, had gone at once to the business of the meeting, and were\ndeep in perusal of the marriage-settlement of which they were to be\nwitnesses.\n\n\"Why, Miss Bowen, you are a richer girl than I knew,\" said Emma's worthy\nhusband, coming forward, with his round pleasant face. \"I congratulate\nyou; at this particular crisis, when hundreds are being ruined by last\nyear's mania for railway speculation, it is most fortunate to have safe\nfunded property.\"\n\nMajor Harper's conscience groaned within, and it was all over. He\nresigned himself to stern necessity and force of circumstances--hoping\neverything would turn out for the best.\n\nThen they all gathered round the table, and Mr. Grimes droned out the\nnecessary formalities. The bride-elect listened, half in a dream--the\nbridegroom rather more attentively.\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said he, pausing, with the pen in his hand, and\ncasting his eyes keenly over the document--\"are you quite sure this\ndeed answers the purpose I intended? This is the total amount of\nproperty which Mr. Bowen left?\"\n\nAnd he looked from his brother to the lawyer with an anxiety which long\nafterwards recurred bitterly to Agatha's mind.\n\nMr. Grimes bowed, and assured him that all was correct. So the young\nbridegroom signed with a steady hand, and afterwards watched the rather\ntremulous signature of his bride. Then an inexpressible content diffused\nitself over his face. Putting her arm in his, he led her away proudly,\nas though she were already his own.\n\nConfused by her novel position, Agatha looked instinctively for some\nwomanly encouragement, but Emma Thorny-croft was busily engaged in\nadmiring observation of some wedding presents, and Mrs. Ianson was worse\nthan nobody.\n\n\"Miss Valery!--what has become of Miss Valery? said the bride, her eyes\nwandering restlessly around. Other eyes followed hers--Major Harper's.\nIncredulously these rested on the silent lady in the background, whose\nwhole mien, figure, and attire, in the plain dark dress, and close\nmorning cap, marked her a woman undeniably and fearlessly middle-aged.\n\n\"Is it possible!\" he exclaimed. \"Can that be Anne Valery?\"\n\nThe lady arose, and met him with extended hand. \"It is Anne Valery, and\nshe is very glad to see you, Major Harper.\"\n\nThey shook hands; his confused manner contrasting strongly with\nher perfect serenity. After a moment Miss Bowen, who could not help\nwatching, heard him say:\n\n\"I, too, am glad we have met at last. I hope it is as friends!\"\n\n\"I was never otherwise to you,\" she answered, gently; and joined the\ncircle.\n\nThis rather singular greeting, noticed by none but herself, awakened\nAgatha's old wrath against Major Harper, lest, as her romantic\nimagination half suggested, the secret of Anne Valery's always\nremaining Anne Valery, was, that his old companion had been first on\nthe illustrious Frederick's long list of broken hearts. If so, never was\nthere a broken heart that made so little outward show, or wore such a\ncheerful exterior, as Miss Valery's.\n\nBut Agatha's own heart was too full of the busy trembling fancies\nnatural to her position to speculate overmuch on the hearts of other\npeople. Very soon Major Harper quitted the house, and the Thornycrofts\nalso. She was left alone with her lover and with Anne--Anne, who ever\nsince her arrival had seemed to keep a steady watch over Nathanael's\nbride. They had rarely met, and for brief intervals; yet Agatha felt\nthat she was perpetually under this guardianship, gentle, though\nstrong--holding her fluctuating spirit firm, and filling her with all\ncheerful hopes and tender thoughts of her future husband. She seemed to\ngrow a better woman every time she saw Anne Valery. It was inexpressibly\nsweet to turn for a few moments each day from the lace and the ribbons,\nthe dresses and the bridecake, and hear Anne talk of what true marriage\nreally was--when two people entirely and worthily loved one another.\n\nOnly Agatha had not the courage to confess, what she began to hope was\na foolish doubt, that the \"love\" which Miss Valery seemed to take for\ngranted she felt towards Nathanael, was a something which as yet she\nherself did not quite understand.\n\nThat Saturday afternoon, nevertheless, she was calmer and more at ease.\nSigning the settlement had removed all doubts from her mind, and made\nher realise clearly that she would soon be Mr. Harper's wife. And he\nwas so tender over her, so happy. Her marriage with him appeared to make\nevery one happy. That very day he had brought her a heap of letters from\nDorsetshire; her first welcome from his kindred--her own that would be.\n\nThey seemed to know all about her--from Anne Valery doubtless--and to\nbe delighted at Nathanael's choice. There was a kind but formal missive\nfrom the old father, implying his dignified satisfaction that at\nlast one of his sons would marry to keep up the family name. From\nthe daughters there were letters varying in style and matter, but all\ncordial except, perhaps, Eulalie's, who had years to wait before\n_she_ married, and was rather cross accordingly. One note, in neat and\ndelicate writing, made Agatha's heart beat; for it was signed, \"Your\naffectionate _sister_, Elizabeth.\"\n\nShe, who had longed for a sister all her life! Heaven was very good to\nher, to give her all ties through one! It seemed, indeed, right and holy\nthat she should be married to Nathanael.\n\nOne only unutterable terror she had, which by a fortunate chance was\nnever alluded to by any one, and she was too much occupied to have it\noften forced on her mind. This was, the thought of having to cross the\nseas to Canada.\n\n\"Oh!\" she sighed, as she sat, with the letters on her lap, listening to\nwhat her lover said of his sisters and his family--\"oh! that we could\ndo as your father seems to wish, and go and live in Dorsetshire, near\nKingcombe Holm.\"\n\n\"I wish it too, if it would please you, dear; but it seems impossible.\nHow could I live in England without a profession?--even supposing Uncle\nBrian did consent to return and settle at home. Sometimes, but very\nrarely, he has hinted at such a possibility.--He has indeed, Anne,\"\ncontinued the young man, noticing how keenly Miss Valery's eyes were\nfixed on him.\n\n\"I am glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"But he always said he would never return till he was grown either\nvery rich or very old. Alas; the latter chance may come, but the former\nnever! Poor Uncle Brian! If he comes at all, it is sure not to be for\nmany years.\"\n\n\"Not for many years!\" repeated Miss Valery, who was crossing over to\nAgatha's side with a piece of rich lace she had been unfolding. As she\nwalked, her hand was unconsciously pressed upon her chest, a habit she\nhad after any quick movement. And, leaning over Agatha, she breathed\npainfully and hard.\n\n\"My dear?\" The young girl looked up. \"Your sisters that are to be\ndesired me to give you from them a wedding-present. It was to be your\nveil. But I had a whim that I would like to give you your veil myself.\nHere it is. Will you accept it, with my love?\"\n\n[Illustration: Will you accept it, with my love  p090]\n\nSo saying, she laid over the bride's head a piece of old point lace,\nmagnificent in texture. Agatha had never seen anything like it.\n\n\"Oh, Miss Valery, to think of your giving me this! It is fit for a\nqueen!\" And she looked at Mr. Harper, hesitating to accept so costly a\ngift.\n\n\"Nay, take it,\" said he smiling. \"Never scruple at its costliness; it\ncannot be richer than Anne's heart.\" And he grasped his old friend's\nhand warmly.\n\nMiss Valery continued, with a slight colour rising in her cheek. \"This\nwas given me twenty years ago for a wedding-veil. It has been wasted\nupon me, you see, but I wish some one to wear it, and would like it to\nbe worn by a Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\n\nAgatha blushed crimson. Nathanael looked delighted. Neither noticed\nAnne Valery; who, her passing colour having sunk into a still deeper\npaleness, quietly returned to her seat, and soon after quitted the\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nIt was a most unconscionably early hour on the wedding morning when Mrs.\nThornycroft, who had insisted on mounting guard overnight in Bedford\nSquare, to see that all things were made ready to go off \"merry as a\nmarriage bell,\" came into Agatha's room and roused the bride.\n\n\"I never knew such a thing in all my life! Well, he is the most\nextraordinary young man! What is to be done, my dear?\"\n\n\"What--what?\" said Agatha, waking, with a confused notion that something\nvery dreadful had happened, or was going to happen. She recollected that\nthis day on which she so early opened her eyes was some day of great\nsolemnity. It seemed so like that of her father's funeral.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, love. Nothing has occurred; only there is Mr.\nHarper in the parlour below, wanting to speak with you. I never heard of\nsuch a request from a bridegroom. It is contrary to all rules of common\nsense and decorum.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Agatha, trying to collect her thoughts. \"Tell me exactly\nhis message.\"\n\n\"That he wished to speak with you at once, before you dress for church;\nand will wait for you in the dining-room. What--you are not going to\ndo as he desires?--I wouldn't! One should never _obey_ till after\nmarriage.\"\n\nAgatha made no answer, but composedly began to dress. In a few minutes\nshe had once more put on the mourning, laid aside as she thought for\never the night before, and had gone down-stairs to her bridegroom.\n\nHe was standing in the only available corner of the room not occupied\nby a chaotic mass of hymeneal preparations, and gazing vacantly out\ninto the square, where the trees cast the long shadows of early morning,\nwhile the merry little sparrows kept up a perpetual din.\n\nAs the door moved, Mr. Harper turned round. He had a sickly, worn look,\nas if he had scarcely slept all night, and in his manner was a strange\nmingling of trouble and of joy.\n\n\"Agatha--how kind! I ought to apologise,\" he began, taking both her\nhands. \"But no! I cannot.\"\n\n\"Nothing is wrong? No misfortune happened?\"\n\n\"Misfortune? God forbid! Surely I do not look as if it were a\nmisfortune? I am only too glad--too happy. Whatever results from it, I\nam indeed happy!\"\n\n\"Then so am I, whatsoever it may be,\" returned Agatha, softly. \"Still,\ndo tell me.\"\n\nHer bridegroom, as he pressed her to his bosom, looked as if he had for\nthe moment forgotten all about his tidings; but afterwards, when her\nsecond entreaty came, he took out a letter and bade her read, holding\nher fast the while with a light firm hand on her shoulder. He seemed\nalmost to fear that at the news he brought she would glide out of his\ngrasp like snow.\n\n\"It is an odd hand--strange to me,\" said Agatha. \"Is it\"--and a sudden\nthought struck her--\"is it\"----\n\n\"Yes--thank God.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, he is safe--I am so glad--so glad!\" cried Agatha, in the\ntrue sympathy of her heart. But her very gladness appeared to\naffect contrariwise the troubled mood of her lover. His hand dropped\nimperceptibly from her shoulder--he sat down.\n\n\"Read the letter, which came late last night. I thought you would be\npleased--that was why I thus disturbed you.\"\n\nAgatha, who had not yet learned the joy or pain of reading momently the\nchanges of a beloved face, immediately perused the letter. It was rather\neccentric of its kind:\n\n\n\"Lodge of O-me-not-tua.\n\n\"My dear Boy,\n\n\"If ever you get into the hands of those red devils, be not alarmed: it\nisn't so bad as it seems. If you saw me now, in the big buffalo-cloak of\na medicine man, after smoking dozens of pipes of peace with every one\nof the tribe, sitting at the door of my lodge, with miles of high\nprairie-grass rolling in waves towards the sunset, you would rather\nenvy me than otherwise, and cry out, as I have often done, 'Away with\ncivilisation!'\n\n\"I am not scalped--I thought I should not be; the tribe (it wastes\nvaluable paper to write their long name, but you will have heard it)\nthe tribe know me too well. I make a capital white medicine-man. I might\nhave escaped any day, but, pshaw! honour!--So I choose to see a little\nof the great western forests, until I know how my two red friends have\nbeen treated on Lake Winnipeg shore. But in no case is any harm likely\nto come to me, except those chances of mortality which are common to\nall.\n\n\"You will receive this (which a worthy psalm-singing missionary conveys\nto New York) almost as soon as the news of our adventure reaches Europe.\nI send it to relieve you, dear nephew, and all friends, if I have any\nleft, from further anxiety concerning me, and especially from useless\nsearch, as under no circumstances whatever shall I consent to return to\nMontreal until it seems to me good.\n\n\"Therefore, stay in Europe as long as, or longer than, you planned, and\nGod prosper you, Nathanael, my good boy.\n\n\"Your affectionate uncle,\n\n\"Brian Locke Harper.\n\n\"I trust earnestly that this scrawl will reach Kingcombe Holm. Possibly,\nno more news of me may ever reach there.--Yet I fear not, for He who is\neverywhere is likewise in the wild western prairies; and life is not so\nsweet that I should dread its ending. Still, if it does end, remember me\nto my brother, my nieces, and all old friends, including Anne Valery. If\nliving, I shall reappear sometime, somewhere. B. L. H.\"\n\n\n\"This is indeed happy news;--so far;\" said Agatha, \"though he seems in\nno cheerful mood.\"\n\n\"Melancholy was always his way at times.\"\n\n\"What a strange man he must be!\" she continued, still thinking more\nof the letter than of anything else. \"But\"--and she turned to\nNathanael--\"your mind is now at rest? You will not need to go to\nAmerica?\"\n\n\"Not just yet.\"\n\nShe looked at him a moment in surprise, for there was something peculiar\nin his manner. She felt half angry with him for sitting so still, and\nspeaking so briefly, while she herself was trembling with delight. \"Have\nyou told Miss Valery?\" He shook his head. \"Ah, then, go at once and tell\nher, so happy as she will be! Do go.\"\n\n\"Presently. Come and sit down here. I want to talk to you, Agatha.\"\n\nShe let him place her by his side. He took her hands, and regarded her\nearnestly.\n\n\"Do you remember what day this was to have been?\"\n\n\"Was to have been?\" she repeated, and instinctively guessed what he had\ndoubtless come to say. Her heart began to beat violently, and her eyes\ndropped in confusion.\n\n\"I say '_was_,' because, if you desire it, it shall not be. I see the\nvery idea is a relief to you. I saw it in your sudden joy.\"\n\nAgatha was amazed--she had till this moment never thought of such a\nthing. Mr. Harper's whole manner of speech and proceeding was so very\nincomprehensible--like a lover's--that she told the entire truth in\nsimply saying \"that she did not understand him.\"\n\n\"Let me repeat it in plainer words.\" But the plainer words would\nnot come; after one or two vain efforts, he sat with averted face,\nspeechless. At last he said abruptly, \"Agatha, do you wish to defer our\nmarriage?\"\n\nAs he spoke, his grasp of her hand was so fierce that it positively hurt\nher. \"Oh, let me go--you are not kind,\" she cried, shrinking from the\npain, which he did not even perceive he had inflicted--so strange a\nmood was upon him. He loosed her hand at once, and stood up before her,\nspeaking vehemently.\n\n\"I meant to be kind--very kind--just in the way that I knew would most\nplease you. I meant to tell you that I wish you to hold yourself quite\nfree, both as to this day or any other days: that you have only to say\nthe word, and--What a fool I am making of myself!\"\n\nMuttering the last words, he turned and walked quickly to the far end\nof the room, leaving Agatha to meditate. It was a new thing to see\nsuch passion in him; and while half frightened she was interested and\ntouched. She would have been more so, but for a certain something in\nhim which roused her pride, until she could not do as she had at first\nintended--follow him, and ask why he was angry. The humility of love was\nnot yet hers.\n\nSo she sat without moving, her eyes fixed on her hand, where the red\nmark left by her lover's grasp was slowly disappearing; until a minute\nafter, he approached.\n\n\"Was that the mark of my fingers on your wrist? Did I hurt you, my poor\nAgatha?\"\n\n\"Yes, a little.\"\n\n\"Forgive me!\" And sitting down beside her, he bent his lips to where\nhis rude grasp had been, kissing the little wrist over and over again,\nthough he did not speak.\n\nHis humility in this, the first ripple which had ever stirred their\ncalmest of all calm courtships, moved Agatha even more than his sudden\ngust of passion. It is a curious fact, that some women--and they not of\nthe weaker or more foolish kind--like very much to be ruled. A strong\nnature is instinctively attracted by one still stronger. Most certainly\nAgatha had never so distinctly felt the cords--not exactly of love, but\nof some influence akin thereto--which this young man had netted round\nher, as when he began to draw them with a tight, firm hand, less that of\na submissive lover than of a dominant husband. She had never liked him\nhalf so well as when, taking her hand once more into his determined\nhold, he said--gently, indeed, but in a tone that would be answered--\n\n\"Now, tell me, what do you wish?\"\n\n\"What do I wish?\" echoed she, feeling as though some hard but firm\nsupport were about to relax from her, leaving her trembling and insecure\nto the world's open blasts. \"I do not know--I cannot tell. Talk to me a\nlittle; that will help me to judge.\"\n\nHis eye brightened, though faintly. \"I will speak, but you shall decide,\nfor all lies in your own hands. I thought this right, and came here\ndetermined on telling you so.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Agatha, expectantly.\n\n\"You promised me this hand to-day, believing I was to leave England at\nonce. My not leaving frees you from that promise--at least at present.\nIf you would rather wait until you know me better, or love me better,\nthen\"--\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"We will quite blot out this day--crush it--destroy it, no matter what\nit was to have been. We will enter upon to-morrow, not as wife and\nhusband, but mere lovers--friends--acquaintances--anything you like.\nNay--I am growing a fool again.\"\n\nHe put his hand to his forehead, sighed heavily, and then continued with\nless violence.\n\n\"If this is what you wish--as from your silence I conclude it is--be\nassured, Agatha, that I shall consent. I will take no wife against her\nwill. The kisses of her lips would sting me, if there were no love in\nher heart.\"\n\nAgatha was still silent.\n\n\"Well then, it must be so,\" said he, in slow, measured speech. \"I must\ngo away out of this house, for I am no bridegroom. You may tell the\nwomen to put away this white finery till it is wanted--which may\nbe--never!\"\n\nShe looked up questioningly.\n\n\"I repeat--_never_. The currents of life, so many and so fierce, may\nsweep us asunder at any moment. I may become mercenary, and choose a\nricher wife even than yourself; or you may turn from me to some one more\npleasing, more winning--my brother, perhaps\"--\n\nAgatha recoiled, while the angry blood flashed from brow to throat. Her\nlover saw it, and for the moment a strange intentness was in his gaze.\nBut immediately he smiled, as a man would at some horrible phantom of\nhis own creating, and continued with a softened manner:\n\n\"Or, if our own wills hold secure, many things may happen, as Anne\nValery forewarned us, to prevent our union. Even ere a month or two--for\nif you are ever mine it must be as soon as then--but even within\nthat time one or other of us may have gone away where no loving, no\nregretting, can ever call us back any more.\"\n\nTerrible was the imagined solitude of a world from which had passed\nthe only being who cherished her--the only being whom she thoroughly\nhonoured. Agatha drew closer to Nathanael.\n\n\"Still, for all that,\" continued he, striving to keep even in his mind\nthe balance of honour and generous tenderness against the arguments of\nselfish passion, \"if for any reason you wish to postpone this day for\nweeks, months, or years, I will take the chance. All shall be as\nyou deem best for your own happiness. As for mine--I will try to be\ncontent.\"\n\nHe paused a little, but it was a pause which no woman could\nmisunderstand. Then, turning back to her, he said in a low tone,\n\n\"When am I to go away, Agatha?\"\n\nHer brow dropped slowly against his arm, as, much agitated, yet not\nunhappy, she whispered the one word \"_Never_.\"\n\nFor one moment Agatha felt against her own the loud convulsive throbs of\nthe heart that loved her--an embrace which, in its fierce rapture, was\nlike none that came before it, or after. When she learned to count and\nchronicle such tokens of love, as one begins to count each wave when\nthe sand grows dry, this embrace remained to her as a truth, a reality,\nwhich no succeeding doubts could explain away or gainsay.\n\nIt lasted, as such moments can but last, a space too brief to be\nreckoned, dying out of its own intensity. Agatha slid from her lover's\narms, and swiftly passing out at the door, met Emma coming in. The\nunlucky bridegroom was left to make his own explanation to Mrs.\nThornycroft, and how he performed that feat remains a mystery to this\nday.\n\nSolemnly, and much affected, the bride went up-stairs to put on her\nwedding-garments.\n\nAnne Valery had just arrived. She sat alone in Miss Bowen's\ndressing-room, playing with the orange-wreath. Her face wore a\nthoughtful, sickly, sad look, but the moment she heard some one at the\ndoor this expression vanished.\n\n\"So, my dear, you have a rather unconscionable bridegroom, Mrs.\nThornycroft tells me. He has been here already.\"\n\nSuddenly all that had happened recurred to Agatha. She forgot her own\nagitation in the joy of being the first to bring good news.\n\n\"Ah, you little know why he came. Uncle Brian--there is a letter from\nUncle Brian.\"\n\nAnd in her warm-heartedness of delight she threw her arms round Miss\nValery's neck. She was very much surprised that Anne did not speak a\nsingle word, and that the cheek against which her young glowing one was\npressed felt as cold as marble.\n\n\"Are you not glad, Miss Valery?\"\n\n\"Yes, very glad. Now will you go down-stairs and fetch me the letter?\"\n\nAnd, gently putting the young girl from her, Anne sat down! As Agatha\nleft the room, she fancied she heard a faint sound--a sigh or gasp; but\nMiss Valery had not moved. She sat as at first--her hands clasped on her\nlap, the veil of her bonnet falling over her face. And coming back some\nminutes after, Agatha found her in precisely the same position.\n\n\"Thank you, dear.\" She held out her hand for the letter, and then\nretired with it to a far window. It took a good while to read. All the\ntime that the young bride was being dressed by Emma and the maid, Miss\nValery stood in that recess, her back turned towards them, apparently\nreading or pondering over that strange scrawl from the Far West.\n\nAt last Mrs. Thornycroft gently hinted that there was hardly time for\nher to return home and dress for the wedding.\n\n\"Dress for the wedding,\" repeated Anne, absently. \"Oh, yes; I remember,\nit was to be early. No fear! I will be quite ready.\"\n\nShe crossed the room, walking slowly, but at the door turned to look at\nthe bride, on whose head Emma was already placing the orange-blossoms.\n\n\"Doesn't she look pretty?\" appealed the gratified matron-ministrant.\n\n\"Yes; very pretty.--God bless her!\" said Miss Valery, and kissed her on\nthe forehead. Agatha quite started--the lips were so cold.\n\n\"Well!\" cried Emma Thornycroft, as the door closed, \"I do wish, my dear,\nthat little Missy had been grown up enough to be your bridesmaid instead\nof that very quiet ordinary-looking old maid. But, after all, the\ncontrast will be the greater.\"\n\nAt nine o'clock the bride's half of the wedding-party were all safely\nassembled in Doctor Ianson's drawing-room, and everything promised to\ngo off successfully--to which result Emma, now all in her glory, prided\nherself as having been the main contributor--and no doubt the kind,\nactive, sensible little matron was right.--When, lo!--there came an\nunlucky _contretemps_.\n\nMajor Harper, who of course was to give away the bride, sent word that\non account of sudden business he could not possibly be at the church\nbefore eleven. At that hour he promised faithfully to meet his brother\nthere. The note which he sent over was a very hurried and disjointed\nscrawl. This was all that the vexed bridegroom knew of the matter.\n\nSo for two long hours Agatha sat in her wedding-dress, strangely quiet\nand silent--sometimes playing with the wreath of orange-blossoms which\nher lover had sent her, and which, being composed of natural flowers,\naccording to a whim of Mr. Harper's, was already beginning to fade.\nStill she refused to put it aside, though the prudent Emma warned her it\nwould be quite withered before she reached the church; \"as was sure to\nbe the case when people were so ridiculous as to wear real flowers.\"\n\nThe good soul went about, half scolding, half crying; hoping nothing\nmight happen, or consoling herself with looking alternately at her\npretty peach-coloured dress, and her \"James,\" who walked about,\nindulging in gay reminiscences of his own wedding, and looking the most\ncomfortable specimen imaginable of a worthy middle-aged \"family man.\"\nNevertheless, in spite of Mr. Thornycroft's efforts to cheer up the\ndreariness of the group, it was a great relief to everybody when, at the\nearliest reasonable time, the bride's small party started, and were at\nlength assembled under the dark arches of Bloomsbury Church--darker than\nusual today, for the morning had gloomed over, and become close, hot,\nand thundery.\n\nPunctually at eleven, but not a minute before, which--Emma\nwhispered--was certainly not quite courteous in a bridegroom, Mr. Harper\ncame in. There was no one with him.\n\n\"My brother not here?\" he said in anxiety.\n\nSome one hinted that Major Harper was never very punctual.\n\n\"He ought to be, this day at least,\" observed Mr. Thorny-croft. \"And I\nam confident I saw him not half-an-hour ago walking homeward round the\nother side of Bedford Square. Do not be alarmed about him, pray.\" This\nlast remark was addressed to Agatha, who, overpowered by the closeness\nof the day, and by these repeated disasters, had begun to turn pale.\n\nNathanael watched her with a keen anxiety, which only agitated her the\nmore. Every one seemed uneasy and rather dull;--a circumstance not very\nremarkable, since, in spite of the popular delusion on that subject,\nvery few ever really look happy at a wedding. It makes clearer to each\none the silent ghost sitting in every human heart, which may take any\nform--bliss long desired, lost, or unfulfilled--or, in the fulfilling\nchanged to pain--or, at best, looked back upon with a memory\nhalf-pensive if only because it is the past.\n\nFor forty interminable minutes did the little party wait in the dreary\nchurch aisles, until the clock, and likewise the beadle, warned them it\nwas near the canonical hour.\n\n\"What are we to do?\" whispered the bridegroom, looking towards Anne\nValery. She took his hand, and drawing it towards Agatha's which hung on\nher arm, said earnestly:\n\n\"Wait no longer--life's changes will not wait Marry her _now_--nothing\nshould come between lovers that love one another.\"\n\nAnne's manner, so faltering, so different from her usual self,\nirresistibly impressed the hearers. Silently the little group moved to\nthe altar; the clergyman, weary of delay, hurried the service, and in\na few minutes the young creatures who eight weeks before had scarcely\nheard each other's names, were made \"not two, but one flesh.\"\n\nIt was all like a dream to Agatha Bowen; she never believed in its\nreality until, signing that name, \"Agatha Bowen,\" in the register-book,\nshe remembered she was so signing it for the last time. A moment after,\nEmma's husband, who had assumed the office of father to the bride,\ncordially shaking her hand, wished all happiness to _Mrs. Harper_.\n\nAgatha started, shivered, and burst into tears. It was a natural thing,\nafter so many hours of overstrained excitement; nor were her tears those\nof unhappiness, yet they seemed, every drop, to burn on her bridegroom's\nheart. To crown all, while these unlucky tears were still falling, some\none at the vestry door cried out, \"There's Major Harper.\"\n\nIt was indeed himself. He entered the church hurriedly--very pale--with\nbeads of dew standing on his brow.\n\n\"Are they married? Am I too late--are they married?\" cried he.\n\nSome uncontrollable feeling made Nathanael move to his wife's side, and\nsnatch her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, meeting his brother's eye, \"we are married.\"\n\nMajor Harper sank into one of the vestry-chairs, muttering something,\ninaudible to all ears save those which seemed fatally gifted with\npreternatural acuteness--the young bridegroom's. Nathanael fancied--nay,\nwas certain--that he heard his brother say, \"_Oh, my poor Agatha._\" He\nlooked suddenly at his bride, whose weeping had changed into silent but\nviolent trembling. He dropped her hand, then with a determined air again\ntook possession of it, saying sharply to his brother:\n\n\"What is the reason of all this? Is anything amiss?\"\n\n\"No, nothing--have I said anything?\"\n\n\"Then why startle us thus? It is not right, Frederick.\"\n\n\"Hush--perhaps he is ill,\" whispered Anne Valery.\n\nMajor Harper looked up, and among the many inquiring eyes, met hers. It\nseemed to fix him, sting him, rouse him to self-command.\n\n\"I am quite well,\" he cried, with a hoarse attempt at laughter. \"A gay\nbachelor always feels doubly cheery at a wedding. So it is all over,\nNathanael? I beg your pardon for being too late; but I have been running\nabout town on important business, till I am half-dead. Still, let me\noffer my congratulations to the bride.\"\n\nHe came forward jauntily, seized Agatha's hand and was about to kiss\nit, but for a slight shrinking on her part. The colour rushed to her\nface--his darkened with an expression of uncontrollable pain. At least\nso it appeared to one who never for a moment relaxed his watch--the\nyounger brother.\n\n\"Really,\" said Mr. Thornycroft, who, during the few minutes thus\noccupied, had bustled in and out of the vestry--\"really, are we never\nintending to come home? Somebody must make a diversion here. Major\nHarper, will you take my wife? Miss Valery, allow me.\"\n\nThis fortunate interference effected a change. All moved away a little\nfrom the bridegroom, who was still standing by his wife's chair.\n\n\"Agatha--will you come?\"\n\nShe mechanically rose; Mr. Harper drew her arm in his, and led her down\nthe aisle. There were a few stray lookers-on at the church-door, who\npeered at them curiously. An inexplicable shadow hung over them. Never\nwere a newly-married couple more silent or more grave.\n\nOnly, as they stood on the entrance-steps that were wet with a past\nshower of thunder-rain, and Agatha in her thin white shoes was walking\nright on, her husband drew her back.\n\n\"It will not hurt me. Do let me go,\" she said.\n\n\"No, you must not; you are mine now,\" was the answer, with a look that\nwould have made the tone of control sound in any loving bride's ear the\nsweetest ever heard.\n\nHe left Agatha in the church, and hurried a little in advance. His\nbrother and Mrs. Thomycroft were standing at the porch outside, Emma\nlaughing and whispering. And while waiting for the carriage, it so\nchanced that Nathanael caught what they were saying.\n\n\"Why, Major Harper, you look as dull as if you had been in love with\nAgatha yourself! And after what you confessed to me, I did positively\nbelieve she was in love with you.\"\n\n\"Agatha in love with me! really you flatter me,\" said Major Harper,\nlooking down and tapping his boot, with his own self-complacent,\nregretful smile.\n\n\"I did indeed think it, from her agitation when I hinted at such a\nthing. And I never was more amazed in my life than when she told me she\nwas going to marry your brother. I do hope, poor dear Agatha\"--\n\n\"Don't speak of her,\" cried Major Harper, in a burst of real emotion.\n\"And she liked me so well, poor child! Oh, I wish to Heaven I had\nmarried her, and saved her from\"--\n\nHere a voice was heard calling \"Mr. Harper--Mr. Harper,\" but the\nbridegroom was nowhere to be seen. Some one--not her husband--put Agatha\ninto the carriage. Several minutes after, Nathanael appeared.\n\n\"Where have you been? Your wife is waiting.\"\n\n\"My wife?\" He looked round bewildered, as if the words struck him with\nthe awful irrevocable sense of what was done. Hurriedly he ran down the\nsteps, sprang into the carriage beside Agatha, and they drove away.\n\nThrough many streets and squares they passed, for the breakfast was\nto be at Emma's house. Agatha sat for the first time alone with her\nhusband. The sun just coming out threw a soft crimson light through the\nclosed carriage blinds; the very air felt warm and sweet, like love.\nAgatha's heart was stirred with a new tenderness towards him into whose\nkeeping she had just given her whole life.\n\nFor a little while she sat, her eyes cast down, wondering what he would\nsay or do, whether he would take her hand, or draw her softly to his\nbreast and let her cry her heart out there, as she almost longed to\ndo--poor fatherless, motherless, brotherless, sisterless girl, who in\nher husband alone must concentrate every earthly tie.\n\nBut he never spoke--never moved. He leaned back in the carriage as pale\nas death, his lips rigidly shut together, his eyes shut too, except that\nnow and then they opened and closed again, to show that he was not in a\nstate of total unconsciousness. But towards his young wife no look ever\nonce wandered.\n\nAt length he started as from a trance and saw her sitting there, very\nquiet, for the pride of her nature was beginning to rise at this strange\ntreatment from him to whom she had just given herself--her all. She was\nnervously moving the fingers of her left hand, where the newly placed\nring felt heavy and strange.\n\nNathanael snatched the hand with violence.\n\n\"Agatha,--are you not my Agatha? Tell me the truth--the whole truth. I\nwill have it from you!\"\n\n\"Mr. Harper!\" she exclaimed, half frightened, half angry.\n\nHis long, searching gaze tried to read her every feature--her pale\ncheeks--her lips proud, nay, almost sullen--her eyes, from which the\nsoftness so lately visible had changed into inquietude and trouble.\nThere was in her all maidenly innocence--no one could doubt that; but\nnothing could be more unlike the shy tenderness of a bride, loving, and\nmarried for love.\n\nSlowly, slowly, the young bridegroom's gaze fell from her, and his\nthoughts settled into dull conviction. All his violence ceased, leaving\nan icy composure, which in itself bore the omen of its lasting stay.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said, in a kind but cold voice, while his vehement\ngrasp relaxed into a loose hold. \"You are my dear wife now, and I will\ntry to be a good husband to you, Agatha.\"\n\nStooping forward, his lips just touched her cheek--which shrank from\nhim, Agatha scarcely knew why.\n\n\"I see!\" he muttered to himself \"Well, be it so! and God help us both!\"\n\nThe carriage stopped. Honest Mr. James Thomycroft was at the door,\nbidding a gay and full-hearted welcome to the bridegroom and bride.\n\nWhat a marriage-day!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\"Are you quite warm there, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Yes, thank you, quite warm,\" she said, turning round a little, and then\nturning back. She sat working, or seeming to work, at a large bay window\nthat fronted the sea at Brighton. Already there had come over her the\nslight but unmistakable change which indicates the wife--the girl no\nlonger. She had been married just one week.\n\nHer husband sat at a table writing, as was his habit during the middle\nof the day, in order that they might walk out in the evening. He had\noften been thus busy during the week, even though it was the first week\nof the honeymoon.\n\nThe honeymoon! How different the word now sounded to Agatha! Yet she had\nnothing to complain of. Mr. Harper was very kind; watchful and tender\nover her to a degree which she felt even more than she saw. In the\nmornings he read to her, or talked, chiefly upon subjects higher and\nwithal pleasanter than Agatha had ever heard talked of before; in the\nevenings they drove out or walked, till far into the starry summer\nnight. They were together constantly, there never passed between them a\nquick or harsh word, and yet--\n\nAgatha vainly tried to solve the dim, cloudy \"yet\" which had no tangible\nform, and only arose now that the first bewilderment of her changed\nexistence was settling into reality, and she was beginning to recognise\nherself as Agatha Harper, no longer a girl, but a married woman. The\nsole conclusion she could come to was, that she must be now learning\nwhat she supposed every one had to learn--that a honeymoon is not quite\nthe dream of bliss which young people believe in, and that few married\ncouples are quite happy during the first year of their union.\n\nAnd Mrs. Harper (or Mrs. Locke Harper, as her husband had had printed on\nthe cards, omitting the name which she had once stigmatised as \"ugly,\")\nwas probably not altogether wide of the truth, though in this case\nshe judged from mistaken because individual evidence. It is next to\nimpossible that two lives, unless assimilated by strong attachment and\nrare outward circumstances, if suddenly thrown together, should at once\nmingle and flow harmoniously on. It takes time, and the influence of\nperfect love, to melt and fuse the two currents into one beautiful\nwhole. Perhaps, did all young lovers believe and prepare for this, there\nwould be fewer disappointed and unhappy marriages.\n\nThough sitting at the open window, with the sharp sea-breeze blowing\nin upon her--it happened to be a sunless and gloomy day--Agatha had\nanswered that she was \"quite warm.\" Nevertheless her heart felt cold.\nNot positively sad, yet void. A great deal of passionate devotion is\nnecessary to make two active human beings content with one another's\nsole company for eight entire days, having nothing to occupy them but\neach other.\n\nWanting this--yet scarcely conscious of her need--the young wife sat, in\nher secret soul all shivering and a-cold. At last, wearied with the long\ngrey sweep of undulating sea, she closed the window.\n\n\"I thought the breeze would be too keen for you,\" said Mr. Harper, whom\nher lightest movement always seemed to attract.\n\n\"Oh no; but I am tired of watching the waves. How melancholy it must be\nto live here. I have a perfect terror of the sea.\"\n\n\"Had I known that, I would not have proposed our coming to-day from\nLeamington to Brighton. But we can leave to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I did not mean that,\" she answered quickly, dreading lest her husband\nmight have thought her speech ungracious or unkind. \"We need not\ngo--unless you wish it.\"\n\nThe bridegroom made no immediate reply: but there was a melancholy\ntenderness in his eyes, as, without her knowing it, he sat watching his\nyoung wife. At length he rose, and putting her arm in his, stood a long\ntime with her at the window.\n\n\"I think, dear Agatha, that you are right. The sea is always sad. How\ndreary it looks now--like a wide-stretched monotonous life whose ending\nwe see not, yet it must be crossed. How shall we cross it?\"\n\nAgatha looked inquiringly.\n\n\"The sea I mean,\" he continued, with a sudden change of tone. \"Shall we\ngo over to France for a week or two?\"\n\n\"Oh no\"--and she shuddered. \"It would kill me to cross the water.\"\n\nHe looked surprised at her unaccountable repugnance, which she had\nscarcely expressed than she seemed overpowered by confusion. Her husband\nforbore to question her further; but the next day told her that he had\narranged for their quitting Brighton and making a tour through the west\nof England, proceeding from thence to London.\n\n\"Where--as my brother, or rather my brother's solicitor, writes me\nword--some business about your fortune will require our return in\nanother fortnight. Are you willing, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--quite willing,\" she cried; for now that her changed life was\nfloating her far away from her old ties, she began to have a yearning\nfor them all.\n\nSo the honeymoon dwindled to three weeks, at the close of which Mr. and\nMrs. Locke Harper were again in London.\n\nIt seemed very strange to Agatha to come back to the known places, and\nroll over the old familiar London stones, and see all things going on as\nusual; while in herself had come so wide a gap of existence, as if those\none-and-twenty days of absence had been one-and-twenty years.\n\nShe had become a little more happy lately; a little more used to her new\nlife. And day by day something undefinable began to draw her towards\nher husband. It was in fact the dawning spirit of love, which should\nand might have come before marriage, instead of being, as now, an\nafter-growth. Beneath its influence Nathanael's very likeness altered;\nhis face grew more beautiful, his voice softer. Looking at him now, as\nhe sat by her side, Mr. Harper hardly appeared to her the same man who,\nreturning from the church as her bridegroom, had impressed her with such\nshrinking awe.\n\nHe too was more cheerful. All the long railway journey he had tried to\namuse her; the humorous half of his disposition--for Nathanael had, like\nmost good men, a spice of humour about him--coming out as it had never\ndone before. However, as they neared London, he as well as his wife had\nbecome rather grave. But when, abruptly turning round, he perceived\nher earnestly, even tenderly regarding him (at which Agatha was foolish\nenough to blush, as if it were a crime to be looking admiringly at one's\nhusband), he melted into a smile.\n\n\"Here we are in the old quarters, Agatha. The question is, Where shall\nwe go to, since we have no lodgings taken?\"\n\n\"You should have let me write to Emma, as I wished.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, shortly; \"it was a pity to trouble her.\"\n\n\"She would not have thought it so, poor dear Emma.\"\n\n\"Were you very intimate with Mrs. Thornycroft? Did you tell her\neverything in your heart, as women do?\"\n\nAgatha was amused by the jealous searching tone and look, so replied\ncarelessly: \"Oh yes, all I had to tell, which was not much. I don't\ndeal in mysteries, nor like them. But the chief mystery now seems to be,\nwhere are we to go? If Emma may not be troubled, surely Mrs. Ianson, or\nyour brother\"--\n\n\"My brother is out of town.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" And Agatha looked as she felt, neither glad nor sorry, but\npurely indifferent. Her husband, observing it, became more cheerful.\n\n\"Nay, my dear Agatha, you shall not be inconvenienced. We will go first\nto some quiet lodgings I know of, where Anne Valery always stays\nwhen she is in London--though she has returned home now, I think. And\nafterwards, if you find the evening very dull\"--\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the young wife, smiling a beautiful negative.\n\n\"We will go and take a sentimental walk through those very squares we\nstrolled through that night--do you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nHow strange seemed that recollection!--how little she had then thought\nshe was walking with her future husband!\n\nYet, when a few hours after she trod the well-known streets, with her\nwifely feelings, sweet and grave, and thought that the arm on which she\nnow leaned was her own through life, Agatha Harper was not unhappy, nor\nwould she for one moment have wished to be again Agatha Bowen.\n\nThe next day, by the husband's express desire--the declaring of which\nwas a great act of self-denial on his part--word was sent to the\nThornycrofts of the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Locke Harper.\n\nVery trembling, shy, and bewitching the bride sat, waiting for the\nmeeting; and when Emma did really come, very tragico-comic, half\npleasure, half tears, was the hearty embrace between the two women. Mr.\nHarper stood and looked on--he played the young husband as composedly\nas he had done the lover and the bridegroom, except for a slight jealous\nmovement as he saw the clinging, the kisses, the tears, which, with\nthe warmth of a heart thrilled by new emotions and budding out into all\nmanner of new tendernesses, Agatha lavished on her friend.\n\nYet, whatever he felt, no one could observe but that Nathanael was\nextremely polite and kind to Mrs. Thorny-croft. She on her part admired\nhim extremely--in whispers.\n\n\"How well he looks! Really quite changed! No one would ever think of\ncalling him a 'boy' now. You must be quite proud of your husband, my\ndear.\"\n\nAgatha smiled, and a light thrill at her heart betrayed its answer.\nVery soon she ceased to be shy and shame-faced, and sat talking quite at\nease, as if she had been Mrs. Locke Harper for at least a year.\n\nEmma Thornycroft was a person not likely to waste much time on\nthe sentimentalities of such a meeting; she soon dashed into the\ncommon-sense question of what were their plans in London? and when they\nwould come and dine with herself and \"James\" \"Quite friendly. We will\nask no one, except of course Major Harper.\"\n\n\"He is out of town,\" said Nathanael.\n\n\"What a pity--Yet, no wonder; London is so terribly hot now. Is he quite\nwell?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" Agatha answered for her husband, who had moved off.\n\n\"Because James has met him frequently of late, rushing about the City as\npale as a ghost, and looking so miserable. We were afraid something was\nwrong with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope not,\" exclaimed Agatha, eagerly.\n\n\"My brother is quite well,\" Mr. Harper again observed, from his outpost\nby the window; and something in his tone unconsciously checked and\nchanged the conversation.\n\nWhether by Agatha's real inclination, or by some unnoticed influence of\nNathanael's, who, gentle as his manners were, through a score of\nother opposing wills seemed always silently to attain his own, Mrs.\nThornycroft's hospitable schemes were overruled. At least, the\n_venue_ was changed from Regent's Park to the Harpers' own temporary\nhome--where, as if by magic, a multitude of small luxuries had already\ngathered round the young wife. She took all quite naturally, never\npausing to think how they came.\n\nIt was with a trepidation which had yet its pleasure, that she arrayed\nherself for this, the first time of her taking her place at the head of\nher husband's table. She put on a high white gown, which Mr. Harper had\nonce said he liked--she was beginning to be anxious over her dress and\nappearance now. Glancing into the mirror, there recurred to her mind\na speech she had once heard from some foolish matron--\"Oh, it does not\nsignify what I wear, or how I look--I'm married!\" Agatha thought what a\nvery wrong doctrine that was! and laughed at herself for never having\nmuch cared to seem pleasing until she had some one to please. Nay, now\nfor the first time she grumbled at the Pawnee-face, wishing it had been\nfairer!\n\nBut fair or not, when it came timidly and shone over Nathanael's\nshoulder, he sitting leaning thoughtfully on his hand, the result was\nsuch as materially to relieve any womanly doubts about her personal\nappearance. He kissed her in unwonted smiling tenderness.\n\n\"I like that dress; and your curls--softly touching them--your curls\nfall so prettily. How well you look, Agatha! Happy, too! Is it really\nso? Are you getting more used to me and my faults, dear?\" There was\nsomething inexpressibly tender in the way he said \"Dear,\" the only\ncaressing word he ever used.\n\n\"Your faults?\" re-echoed she in a merry incredulous tone. But before she\ncould say more, the guests most inopportunely arrived. And Agatha, very\nnaturally, darted from her husband to the other side of the room like a\nflash of lightning.\n\nIf the Thornycrofts had expected to find a couple of turtle-doves cooing\nin a cage, they were certainly disappointed. Mr. and Mrs. Locke Harper\nhad apparently settled down into an ordinary husband and wife, resuming\nserenely their place in society, and behaving towards each other, and\nthe world in general, just like sensible old married people. Their\nfriends, taking the hint, treated them in like manner; and thus, now and\nfor ever, vanished Agatha's honeymoon.\n\nAfter dinner, Emma, anxious about Agatha's proceedings, and still more\nanxious to have a hand in the same, for she was never happy unless busy\nabout her own or other people's affairs, made inquiries as to the future\nplans of the young couple.\n\nAgatha could give no answer, for, to her great thankfulness, her husband\nhad hitherto avoided the subject. She looked at him for a reply.\n\n\"I think, Mrs. Thornycroft, it will probably be three months before\nI\"--he smilingly corrected himself, and said \"_we_ return to Canada.\"\n\n\"Then what do you intend to do meanwhile? Of course, Agatha dear, you\nwill remain in London?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied, accustomed to decide for herself, and forgetting\nat the moment that there was now another to whose decision she was bound\nto defer. Blushing, she looked towards her husband, who was talking to\nMr. Thornycroft. He turned, as indeed he always did when he heard her\nspeaking; but he made no remark, and the \"Yes\" passed as their mutual\nassent to Emma's question.\n\n\"I know a place that would just suit you,\" pursued the latter; \"that is,\nif you take a furnished house.\"\n\n\"I should like it much.\"\n\n\"It is but a cottage--rather small, considering your means; by-the-by,\nAgatha, how close our friend the Major kept all your affairs. No one\nimagined you were so rich.\"\n\n\"Neither did I, most certainly. But--the cottage.\"\n\n\"The prettiest little place imaginable. Such a love of a drawing-room!\nI went there to call on young Northen's sister when she married, last\nyear. Poor thing--sad affair that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Agatha, who now felt an interest in all stories of\nmarriages.\n\n\"It happened a fortnight ago, soon after your wedding. They\nquarrelled--she got through a window, and ran away home to her father.\nIt seems she had never cared a straw for her husband, but had married\nhim out of spite, liking some one else better all the time. His own\nbrother, too, they say.\"\n\n\"What a wicked--wicked thing!\" cried Agatha warmly. So warmly, that she\ndid not see, close by her chair, her husband--watching her intently,\nnay wildly. As she ceased, he rose from his stooping attitude. His\ncountenance became wonderfully beautiful, altogether glowing.\n\n\"Really you seem to have comprehended the matter at once,\" said Mr.\nThornycroft, startled in the winding-up of a long harangue about the\nCorn Laws by the exceedingly bright look which his hearer turned towards\nhim.\n\n\"Yes, I think I shall soon comprehend everything,\" was the answer, as\nMr. Harper placed himself on the arm of his wife's chair in the gay\nattitude of a very boy. She, moving a little, made room for him and\nsmiled. Nay, she even leant silently against his arm, which he had\nthrown round the back of her chair.\n\n\"Come, Agatha, I want to hear about that wonderful house which your\nfriend is persuading you to take. You know, I happen to have a little\nconcern in the matter likewise. Have I not, Mr. Thornycroft?\"\n\n\"Certainly; since you have turned out to be that no less wonderful\npersonage which my wife has been perpetually boring me about for the\nlast two years--Agatha's Husband,\" said Mr. Thornycroft, patiently\nresigning the Corn Laws to their inevitable doom--oblivion.\n\nBut Emma, plunging gladly into her native element, discussed the whole\nhouse from attic to kitchen. Mr. Harper listened with a complaisant and\namused look. Beginning to discern the sterling good there was in the\nlittle woman, he passed over her harmless small-mindedness; knowing well\nthat in the wide-built mansion of human nature there must be always a\ncertain order of beings honourable, useful, and excellent in themselves,\nto form the basement-story.\n\nThe twilight darkened while Emma talked, the faster perhaps that her\n\"James,\" whose respected presence always restrained her tongue, was\ndiscovered to be undeniably asleep. But the young couple were excellent\nlisteners. Nathanael still sat balancing himself on the arm of his\nwife's chair; his hand having dropped playfully among her curls. He\njoined with gaiety in all the discussions. More than once, in talking of\nthe various arrangements of their new household, his voice faltered, and\nthe hearts of the husband and wife seemed trembling towards one another.\n\nThe conversation ended in Emma's receiving _carte-blanche_ to take the\nhouse, if practicable, that the Harpers might settle there for three\nmonths certain.\n\n\"Come, this is better than I expected,\" cried the worthy little woman.\n\"We shall be neighbours, and I can teach Agatha house-keeping. She\nwill have a nice little _m\u00c3\u00a9nage_, and can give a proper 'At Home' and\ncharming wedding parties. Shall she not, Mr. Harper?\"\n\n\"If she wishes.\"\n\nBut Agatha's whispered \"No,\" and kind pressure of the hand, brought to\nhim a most blissful conviction that she did _not_ wish, and that she\nwould be, as she said, \"happier living quietly at home.\" _Home_! what a\nword of promise that sounded in both their ears!\n\nWhen the lights came, Mr. Thornycroft woke up; with many apologies, poor\nman; only, as his wife said, \"Everybody knew how hard James worked, and\nhow tired he was at night.\" The two gentlemen fraternised once more.\nThey began one of those general arguments on the history of the times,\nwhich when spoken, are intensely interesting, and being written as\nintensely prosy. The ladies listened in a most wife-like and pleased\nsubmission.\n\n\"How well my husband talks--doesn't he?\" whispered Emma, with sparkling\neyes.\n\nAgatha agreed, and indeed Mr. Thornycroft's strong sense and acute\njudgment were patent to every one. But when Mr. Harper spoke, his\nclear views on every point, his trenchant but pleasant wit, by which\nhe rounded off the angularities of argument, and above all his keen,\nfar-seeing intellect, which dived into wondrous depths of knowledge, and\ninvariably brought something precious to light--these things were to the\nyoung wife a positive revelation.\n\nShe sat attentive, beginning to learn, what strange to say was no\npain--her own ignorance, and her husband's superior wisdom. She had\nnever before felt at once so humble and so proud.\n\nWhen the Thornycrofts departed, and Mr. Harper returned up-stairs from\nbidding them good-bye, he found his wife in a thoughtful mood.\n\n\"Well, dear, have you had a pleasant evening? Are you content with our\nplans?\"\n\n\"Yes--indeed, more so than I deserve. Oh, how good you are!\" she\nwhispered; and her shortcomings towards him grew into a great burden of\nregret.\n\n\"Hush!\" he answered, smiling; \"we will not begin discussing one\nanother's goodness, or you know the subject would be interminable. And\nI would like us to hold a little serious consultation before to-morrow.\nYou are not sleepy?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Stretch yourself out on the sofa, and let me sit beside you. There--are\nyou quite comfortable?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" she said, and thought for the hundredth time how sweet it was\nto have some one to take care of her.\n\n\"Now, my wife, listen! You seemed to long for that cottage very much,\nand you shall have it. Nay, you ought, because at present you are the\nrich lady; while I, so long as I remain in England, receive none of my\nsalary from Montreal, and am, comparatively speaking, poor. In fact,\nnothing but that very secondary character, Agatha's Husband.'\"\n\nThough he laughed, there was a little jarring tone in this confession;\nbut Agatha was too simple to notice it. He continued quickly,\n\n\"Nevertheless, this question is only temporary; I shall be quite your\nequal in Canada.\"\n\n\"In Canada!\" she echoed dolefully. \"Oh, surely--surely we need not go?\"\n\n\"Are you in earnest, Agatha?\"\n\n\"I am indeed,\" said she, gathering up courage to speak to him of what\never since her marriage had been growing an inexpressible dread.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"I--I am afraid to tell.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you? You cannot bear to leave your old friends? You fear\nto go into a new country, entirely among strangers, with only your\nhusband?\"\n\nHis suddenly suspicious tone stopped the frank denial that was bursting\nto his wife's lips. She only said a little hurt, \"If that were true, I\nwould have told you. I always speak exactly what I think.\"\n\n\"Is it so? is it indeed so?\" he cried, with a lightening of countenance\nas sudden as its shade. \"Oh, Agatha, forgive me,\" and his heart\nseemed melting before her. \"I am not good to you--but you do not quite\nunderstand me yet.\"\n\n\"I feel that. Yet what can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothing! Only wait I will try to cure myself without paining you. But,\nfor the sake of our whole life's happiness, henceforward always be open\nwith me, Agatha! Don't hide from me anything! Set your frank goodness\nagainst my wicked suspiciousness, and make me ashamed of myself, as\nnow.\"\n\nHe had not spoken so freely or with so much emotion since they were\nmarried; and his wife was deeply touched. She made no answer, but half\nraising herself, crept to his arms, almost as if she loved him. So she\ntruly did, in a measure, though not with the spontaneous, self-existent\nlove, which, once lit in a woman's breast, is like the central\nfire hidden in the earth's bosom, enduring through all surface\nvariations--through summer and winter, earthquakes, floods, and\nstorms--utterly unchangeable and indestructible. And, however wildly\nextravagant this simile may sound--however rare the fact it illustrates,\nnevertheless such Love is a great truth, possible and probable, which\nhas existed and may exist--thank God for it!--to prove that He did not\nfound the poetry of all humanity upon a beautiful deceit.\n\nSomething of this mystery was beginning to stir in the wife's heart;\nthe girl-wife, married before her character was half formed--before\nthe perfecting of real love, which, taking, as all feelings must, the\nimpress of individual nature, was in her of slow development.\n\nAs Agatha lay, her head hidden on her husband's shoulder, guessing out\nof her own heart something of what was passing in his, there came to her\nthe first longing after that oneness of spirit, without which marriage\nis but a false or base union, legal and sanctified before men, but, oh!\nhow unholy in the sight of God!\n\nThe young wife felt as if now, and not until now, she could unfold\nto her husband all the secrets of her heart, all its foolishness,\nignorance, and fears.\n\n\"If you will listen to me, and not despise me very much, I will tell you\nsomething that I have never told to any one until now.\"\n\nShe could not imagine why, but at this soft whisper he trembled;\nhowever, he bade her go on.\n\n\"You wonder why it is I am so terrified at leaving England? It is not\nfor any of the reasons you said, but for one so foolish that I am half\nashamed to confess it. I dare not cross the sea.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Mr. Harper cried, and the unutterable dread which had\nactually blanched his cheek disappeared instantaneously. He felt himself\nanother man.\n\n\"Wait, and I'll tell you why this is,\" continued Agatha. \"When I was\na little child, somewhere about four years old, I was at some seaport\ntown--I don't know where nor ever did, for there was no one with me but\nmy nurse, and she died soon after. One day, I remember being in a\nlittle boat going to see a large ship. There were other people with us,\nespecially one lady. Somehow, playing with her, I fell overboard.\" Here\nAgatha shuddered involuntarily. \"It may be very ridiculous, but even\nnow, when I am ill or restless in mind, I constantly dream over again\nthat horrible drowning.\"\n\nHer husband drew her closer to him, murmuring, \"Poor child!\"\n\n\"Ah, I was indeed a poor child! When, after being brought to life\nagain--for I fancy I must have been nearly dead--my nurse forbade me\never to speak of what had happened, no one can tell into what a terror\nit grew. I never shall overcome it, never! The very sight of the sea is\nmore than I can bear. To cross it---to be on it\"--\n\n\"Hush, dear, quiet yourself,\" said her husband, soothingly. \"Now, tell\nme all you can remember about this.\"\n\n\"Scarcely anything more, except that when I came to myself I was lying\non the beach, with the stranger lady by me.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\n\"I have not the slightest idea. Being so young, I recollect little about\nher--in fact, only one thing: that just as she was leaving me to go on\nin the little boat, my nurse called out, 'The ship is gone!' and the\nlady fell flat down--dead, as I thought then. They carried me away, and\nI never saw or heard of her again.\"\n\n\"How strange!\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Agatha, gathering courage as she found her husband did\nnot smile at this story, and beginning to speak with him more freely\nthan she had ever done with any person in her life, \"but you have no\nidea what a vivid impression the circumstance left on my mind. For years\nI made of this lady--to whom I feel sure I owed in some way or other the\nsaving of my life--a sort of guardian angel I believe I even prayed to\nher--such a queer, foolish child I was--oh, so foolish!\"\n\n\"Very likely, dear; we all are,\" said Mr. Harper, gaily. \"And you are\nquite sure you never saw your angel?\"\n\n\"No, nor any one like her. The person most like, and yet very unlike,\ntoo, in some things, was--don't laugh, please--was Miss Valery. That, I\nfancy, was the reason why I liked her so from the first, and was ready\nto do anything she bade me.\"\n\n\"Then when you consented to be married it was not for love of me but\nof Anne Valery?\" And beneath Nathanael's smile lingered a little sad\nearnest.\n\nHis wife did not answer--even yet she was too shy to say the words, \"I\nlove you.\" But she took his hand, and reverently kissed it, whispering,\n\n\"I am quite content. I would not have things otherwise than they are.\nAnd all I mean by telling such a long foolish story is this--teach\nme how to conquer myself and my fears, and I will go with you\nanywhere--even across the sea.\"\n\n\"My own dear wife!\" His voice was quite broken; so sudden, so unexpected\nwas this declaration from her, and by the tremblings which shook her all\nthe while he saw how great her struggle had been.\n\nFor many minutes, holding her little head on his arm, the young husband\nsat silent, buried in deep thought; Agatha never saw the changes,\nbitter, fierce, sorrowful, that by turns swept over the face under which\nher own lay so calmly, with sweet shut eyes. Strange difference between\nthe woman and the man!\n\n\"Agatha,\" he said at last, \"I have quite decided.\"\n\n\"Decided what?\"\n\n\"That I will give up my office at Montreal, and we will live in\nEngland.\"\n\nShe was so astonished that at first she could not speak; then she burst\ninto joyful tears, and hung about him, murmuring unutterable thanks. For\nthe moment he felt as if this reward made his sacrifice nothing, and yet\nit had cost him almost everything that his manly pride held dear.\n\n\"Then you will not go? You will never cross the terrible Atlantic\nagain?\"\n\n\"I do not promise that: for I must go, soon or late, if only to persuade\nUncle Brian to return with me to England.--Uncle Brian! what will he\nsay when he learns that I have given up my independence, and am living\npensioner on a rich wife?\"\n\nAgatha looked surprised.\n\n\"But,\" continued he, trying to make a jest of the matter, \"though I do\nrenounce my income in the New World, I am not going to live an idler on\nyour little ladyship's bounty. I intend to work hard at anything that I\ncan find to do. And it will be strange if, in this wide, busy England,\nI cannot turn to some honourable profession. If not, I'd rather go into\nthe fields and chop wood with this right hand\"--\n\nAnd suddenly dashing it down on the table, he startled Agatha very much;\nso much that she again clung to him, and innocently begged him not to be\nangry with her.\n\nThen, once more, Nathanael took his wife in his arms, and became calm in\ncalming her. Thus they sat, until the silence grew heavenly between\nthe two, and it seemed as if, in this new confidence, and in the joy of\nmutual self-renunciation, were beginning that true marriage, which makes\nof husband and wife not only \"one flesh,\" but one soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nIt had been arranged with Emma Thornycroft that Mrs. Harper should take\nthe benefit of that lady's superior domestic and worldly experience--for\nAgatha herself was a perfect child in such matters--and that they two\nshould go over the intended house together. Accordingly, in the course\nof the following day Mrs. Thornycroft appeared to carry away the young\nwife, and give her the first lesson in household responsibilities.\n\nFrom this important business, Mr. Harper was laughingly excluded, as\nbeing only a \"gentleman,\" and required merely to pronounce a final\ndecision upon the niceties of feminine choice.\n\n\"In fact,\" said Emma, gaily assuming the autocracy of her sex, \"husbands\nought to have nothing at all to do with house-choosing or house-keeping,\nexcept to pay the rent and the bills.\"\n\nAgatha could not help laughing at this, until she saw that Mr. Harper\nwas silent.\n\nA few minutes before they started he took his wife aside, and showed her\na letter. It was the formal renunciation of the appointment he held at\nMontreal.\n\n\"How kind!\" she cried in unfeigned delight. \"And how quickly you have\nfulfilled your promise!\"\n\n\"When I have once decided I always like to do the thing immediately.\nThis letter shall go to-day.\"\n\n\"Ah!--let me post it,\" whispered Agatha, taking a wilful, childish\npleasure in thus demolishing every chance of the future she had so\ndreaded.\n\n\"What! cannot you yet trust me?\" returned her husband. \"Nay, there is no\nfear. What is done is done. But you shall have your way.\"\n\nAnd walking with them a little distance, he suffered Agatha with her own\nhands to post the decisive letter.\n\nAfter he left them, she told Mrs. Thornycroft the welcome news,\nenlarging upon Mr. Harper's goodness in resigning so much for her sake.\n\n\"Resigning?\" said Emma, laughing. \"Well, I don't see much noble\nresignation in a young man's giving up a hardworking situation in the\ncolonies to live at ease on his wife's property in England. My dear,\nhusbands always like to make the most of their little sacrifices. You\nmustn't believe half they say.\"\n\n\"My husband never said one word of his,\" cried Agatha, rather\nindignantly, and repented herself of her frankness to one whose\nideas now more than ever jarred with her own. Three weeks' constant\nassociation with a man like Nathanael had lifted her mind above the\nordinary standard of womanhood to which Emma belonged. She began to half\nbelieve the truth of what she had once with great astonishment heard\nAnne Valery declare--ay, even Anne Valery--that if the noblest moral\ntype of man and of woman were each placed side by side, the man would be\nthe greater of the two.\n\nBut this thought she kept fondly to herself, and suffered Emma to talk\non without much attending to her conversation. It was chiefly about\nsome City business with which \"her James\" had been greatly annoyed of\nlate--having to act for a friend who had been ruined by taking shares\nin a bubble company formed to work a Cornish mine. Agatha had often\nbeen doomed to listen to such historiettes. Mrs. Thornycroft had a\ngreat fancy for putting her harmless fingers into her husband's business\nmatters, for which the chief apology in her friend's eyes was the good\nlittle wife's great interest in all that concerned \"my James.\" So Agatha\nhad got into a habit of listening with one ear, saying, \"Yes,\" \"No,\" and\n\"Certainly;\" while she thought of other things the while. This habit she\nto-day revived, and, pondered vaguely over many pleasant fancies\nwhile hearing mistily of certain atrocities perpetrated by \"City\nscoundrels\"--Emma was always warm in her epithets.\n\n\"The 'Company,' my dear, is a complete take-in--all sham names,\nsecretaries, treasurers, and even directors. The whole affair was got\nup among two or three people in a lawyer's office; and who do you think\nthat lawyer is, Agatha?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Harper, feeling as perfectly indifferent as if\nhe were the man in the moon.\n\n\"I am not sure that I ought to tell you, for James only found it out, or\nrather guessed it, this morning at breakfast-time. And if the thing can\nonly be proved, it will go very suspiciously against the people who\nhave been mixed up in the affair, and especially against this Mr.\nGrimes.--There, I declare I've let the cat out of the bag at last, for\nall James cautioned me not!\"\n\n\"Well, be content,\" said Agatha, awaking from a reverie as to how many\ndays her husband intended to stay at Kingcombe Holm, whither they were\nthis week going on a formal invitation, and whether the new house would\nbe quite ready on their return--\"Be content, Emma; I really did not\ncatch the name.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" said the gossiping little woman--though she looked\nextremely sorry. \"Of course, if Major Harper had known--why, you would\nhave heard.\"\n\n\"Heard what\" asked Agatha, her curiosity at last attracted by\nher brother-in-law's name. But now Emma seemed wilfully bent upon\nmaintaining a mysterious silence.\n\n\"That's exactly what I can't tell you, my dear, except thus much--that\nmy husband is afraid Major Harper has been losing a good deal of money,\nsince more than two-thirds of the shares in Wheal Caroline were in his\nname, and now the vein has failed--that is, if ever there was a vein or\na mine at all--and the other shareholders declare there has been a great\ndeal of cheating somewhere--and--you understand.\"\n\nAgatha did not understand one jot. All she drew from this confused\nvolubility was the fact that Major Harper had somehow lost money, for\nwhich she was very sorry. But to her utter ignorance of financial or\nbusiness matters the term \"losing money\" bore very little meaning.\nHowever, she recurred with satisfaction to her own reputed wealth, and\nthought if Major Harper were in any need he would of course tell his\nbrother, and she and Nathanael could at once supply what he wanted.\nShe determined to speak to her husband the first opportunity, and so\ndismissed the subject, as being not half so interesting as that of \"the\nnew house.\"\n\nAt the gate of this the two ladies now stood, and Emma, with a matronly\nimportance, introduced the gratified young wife to all its perfections.\n\nIf there be one instinct that lurks in a woman's breast, ready to\nspring up when touched, and bloom into all sorts of beautiful and\nhappy feelings, it is the sense of home--of pleasant domestic sway and\ndomestic comfort--the looking forward to \"a house of one's own.\" Many\nordinary girls marry for nothing but this; and in the nobler half\nof their sex even amidst the strongest and most romantic personal\nattachment there is a something--a vague, dear hope, that, flying beyond\nthe lover and the bridegroom, nestles itself in the husband and the\nfuture home.--The home as well as the husband, since it is given by him,\nis loved for his sake, and made beautiful for his comfort, while he is\nthe ruler, the guide, and the centre of all.\n\nMrs. Harper, as she went through the rooms of this, the first house\nshe had ever looked on with an eye of interest, admiring some things,\nobjecting to others, and beginning to arrange and decide in her own\nmind,--felt the awakening of that feeling which philosophers call \"the\ndomestic instinct\"--the instinct which makes of women good wives, fond\nmothers, and wise mistresses of pleasant households. She wondered that,\nas Agatha Bowen, she had thought so little of these things.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, brightening up as she listened to Emma's long-winded\ndiscourse upon furniture and arrangements, and learning for the first\ntime to appreciate the capital good sense of that admirable domestic\noracle and young housekeeper's guide--\"Yes, I think this will just do.\nAnd, as you say, we easily manage to buy it, furniture and all, so as to\nmake what improvements we choose. Oh, how delicious it will be to have a\nhouse of one's own!\"\n\nAnd the tears almost came into her eyes at thought of that long vista of\nfuture joy--the years which might pass in this same dwelling.\n\n\"My husband,\" she said to the person who showed them over the place--and\nher cheeks glowed, and her heart dilated with a tender pride as she used\nthe word--\"my husband will come to-morrow and make his decision. I think\nthere is very little doubt but that we shall take the house.\"\n\nSo anxious was she to conclude the matter and let Mr. Harper share in\nall her pleasant feelings, that she excused herself from staying at\nEmma's until he came to fetch her, and determined to walk back to meet\nhim.\n\n\"What, with nobody to take care of you?\" said Emma.\n\n\"The idea of anybody's taking care of me! We never thought of such a\nthing three months ago. I used to come and go everywhere at my own sweet\nwill, you know.\" Nevertheless, it was a sweet thought that there _was_\nsomebody to take care of her. Her high spirit was beginning to learn\nthat there are dearer pleasures in life than even the pleasure of\nindependence.\n\nPondering on these things--and also on the visit to Kingcombe Holm which\nher husband had that morning decided--she walked through the well-known\nsquares, her eyes and her veil lowered, her light springy step\nrestrained into matronly dignity. Agatha had a wondrous amount of\ndignity for such a little woman. Her gait, too, had in it something very\npeculiar--a mixture of elasticity, decision, and pride. Her small figure\nseemed to rise up airily between each footpress, as if unaccustomed to\ncreep. There was a trace of wildness in her motions; hers was anything\nbut a dainty tread or a lazy drawing-room glide; it was a bold, free,\nIndian-like walk--a footstep of the wilderness.\n\nNo one who had once known her could ever mistake Agatha, be she seen\never so far off; and as she went on her way, a gentleman, crossing\nhastily from the opposite side of the square, saw her, started, and\nseemed inclined to shrink from recognition. But she, attracted by his\nmanner, lifted up her eyes, and soon put an end to his uncertainty.\nThough a good deal surprised by the suddenness of the _rencontre_, there\nwas no reason on earth why Mrs. Harper should not immediately go up and\nspeak to her husband's brother.\n\nShe did so, holding out her hand frankly.\n\nMajor Harper's response was hesitating to a painful degree. He looked,\nin the common but expressive phrase, \"as if he had seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"Who would have thought of meeting you here, Miss Bowen--Mrs. Harper I\nmean?\" he added, seeing her smile at the already strange sound of her\nmaiden name. What could have possessed Major Harper to be guilty of such\nuncourteous forgetfulness?\n\n\"You evidently did not think I was my real self, or you would not have\nbeen going to pass me by; I--that is, _we_\"---at the word Nathanael's\nwife cast off her shyness, and grew bravely dignified--\"we came back to\nLondon two days ago.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Your brother,\" she had not yet quite the courage to say \"my husband,\"\nwhen speaking of him, especially to Frederick Harper--\"your brother\nthought you were out of town.\"\n\n\"I?--yes--no. No, it was a mistake. But are you not going in? Good\nmorning!\"\n\nIn his confusion of mind he was handing her up the steps of Dr.\nIanson's door, which they were just passing. Agatha drew back; at first\nsurprised, then alarmed. His strange manner, his face, not merely\npale but ghastly, the suppressed agitation of his whole aspect, seemed\nforewarnings of some ill. It was her first consciousness that she was\nno longer alone, in herself including alike all her pleasure and all her\npain.\n\n\"Oh, tell me,\" she cried, catching his arm, \"is there anything the\nmatter? Where is my husband?\"\n\nThe quick fear, darting arrow-like to her heart, betrayed whose image\nlay there nearest and dearest now. Major Harper looked at her, looked\nand--sighed!\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said kindly; \"all is well with your husband, for\naught I know. He is a happy fellow in having some one in the world to be\nalarmed on his account.\"\n\nAgatha blushed deeply, but made no reply. She took her brother-in-law's\noffered arm, offered with a mechanical courtesy that survived the great\ndiscomposure of mind under which he evidently laboured, and turned with\nhim towards home. She was at once puzzled and grieved to see the state\nhe was in, which, deny it and disguise it as he would--and he tried\nhard to do so--was quite clear to her womanly perception. His laugh was\nhollow, his step hurried, his eyes wandering from side to side as if he\nwere afraid of being seen. How different from his old cheerful lounge,\nfull of a good-natured conceit, apparently content with himself, and\nwilling that the whole street should gaze their fill at Major Frederick\nHarper.\n\nSo old he looked, too; as if the moment his merry mask of smiles was\nthrown off, the cruel lurking wrinkles appeared. Agatha pitied him, and\nfelt a return of the old liking, warm and kind, such as it was before\nthe innuendoes of foolish friends had first lured her to distrust the\nnature of her own innocent feelings, and then changed them into positive\ncontempt and aversion.\n\nShe said, with an air of gentle matronly freedom, half sisterly, too,\nand wholly different from the shy manner of Agatha Bowen to Major\nHarper:\n\n\"You must come home with me. I fear you are ill, or in anxiety. Why did\nyou not tell your brother?\" And suddenly she thought of Emma's statement\nof the morning. But Agatha, in her unworldliness, never supposed such a\ntrivial loss as that of money could make any man so miserable as Major\nHarper seemed.\n\n\"I ill? I anxious? I tell my brother?\" he repeated, sharply.\n\n\"Nay, as you will. Only do come to us. He will be so glad to see you.\"\n\n\"Glad to see me?\" He again repeated her words, as though he had none\nof his own, or were too bewildered to use them. Nevertheless, through\na certain playful influence which Agatha could exert when she liked,\nmaking almost everybody yield to her, Major Harper suffered himself to\nbe led along; his companion talking pleasantly to him the while, lest he\nmight think she noticed his discomposure.\n\nArrived at home, they found that Nathanael had walked to the Regent's\nPark to fetch his wife, according to agreement.\n\nMrs. Harper looked sorry. She had already learned one little secret of\nher husband's character--his dislike to any unpunctuality, any altered\nplans or broken promises. \"Still, you must come in and wait for him.\"\n\n\"Wait for whom?\" said Major Harper, absently.\n\n\"Your brother.\"\n\n\"My brother!--I, wait to see my brother! Impossible--I--I'll write. Good\nmorning--good morning.\"\n\nHe was leaving the hall--more hurried and agitated than ever--when Mrs.\nHarper, now really concerned, laid her hand upon his arm.\n\n\"I will not let you go. Come in, and tell me what ails you.\"\n\nThe soft whisper, the eyes of genuine compassion--womanly compassion\nonly, without any love--were more than Major Harper could resist.\n\n\"I will go,\" he muttered. \"Better tell it to you than to my brother.\"\nAnd he followed her up-stairs.\n\nThe cool shadow of the room seemed to quiet his excitement; he drank a\nglass of water that stood by, and became more like himself.\n\n\"Well, my dear young lady,\" he said, with some return of the paternal\nmanner of old times, \"when did you come back to London?\"\n\n\"Two days since, as I told you. And, as you will soon hear, your\nbrother's plans are all changed--we are going to live in London.\"\n\n\"To live in London?\"\n\n\"He has given up his appointment at Montreal. We have taken a house, or\nshall take it to-day, and settle here. He intends entering at the bar,\nor something of the sort; but you must persuade him not. What is the use\nof his toiling, when I--that is we--are so rich?\"\n\nWhile Agatha thus talked, chiefly to amuse her brother-in-law and make\nhim feel that she was really his sister, one and the same in family\ninterests--while she talked, she was astonished to see Major Harper's\nface overspread with blank dismay.\n\n\"And--Nathanael has really given up his appointment?\"\n\n\"He has, and for my sake. Was it not good of him?\"\n\n\"It was madness! Nay--it is I that have been the madman--it is I that\nhave done it all Agatha, forgive me! But no--you never can!\"\n\nAs they stood together by the fireplace he snatched her hand, gazing\ndown upon her with unutterable remorse.\n\n\"Poor Bowen's daughter that he trusted to me! Such a mere child too! Oh,\nforgive me, Agatha!\"\n\nShe thought some extraordinary delusion had come upon him--perhaps the\nforerunner of some dreadful illness. She tried to take her hand away,\nthough kindly, for she firmly believed him to be delirious. Nothing\ncould really have happened to herself that Mr. Harper did not know. With\nhim to take care of her, she was quite safe. And in that moment--for all\npassed in a moment--Nathanael's wife first felt how implicitly she was\nbeginning to put her trust in him.\n\nWhile she remained thus--her hand still closed tightly in her\nbrother-in-law's grasp, half terrified, yet trying not to show her\nterror--the door opened, and her husband entered.\n\nAt first Mr. Harper seemed petrified with amazement; then he turned\ndeadly white. Crossing the room, he laid a heavy hand on his brother's\nshoulder:\n\n\"Frederick, you forget yourself; this is my wife,--Agatha!\"\n\nThe searching agony of that one word, as he turned and looked her full\nin the face, was unutterable. She scarcely perceived it.\n\n\"Oh, I am so glad you are come,\" was all she said. He drew her to his\nside--indeed, she had sprung there of her own accord--and wrapped his\narms tightly round her, as if to show that she was his possession, his\nown property.\n\n\"Now, brother, whatever you wished to say to my wife, say it to us\nboth.\"\n\nMajor Harper could not speak.\n\n\"He was waiting to see you; he is ill--very ill, I think,\" whispered\nAgatha to her husband. \"Shall I leave you together?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, releasing her, but only to draw her back again,\nwith the same wildly questioning look, the meaning of which was to her\ninnocence quite inexplicable.--\"My wife?\"\n\n\"My dear husband!\"\n\nAt that whisper, which burst from her full heart in the comfort of\nseeing him and of knowing that he would take on himself the burden of\nall her anxiety, Nathanael let her go. She crept away, most thankful to\nget out of the room, and leave Major Harper safe in his brother's hands.\n\nBut when a quarter of an hour--half-an-hour--passed by, and still the\ntwo gentlemen remained shut up together, without sending for her to join\ntheir conference, or, as she truly expected, to tell her that poor Major\nHarper must be taken home in the delirium of brain fever--Agatha began\nrather to wonder at the circumstance.\n\nShe apprehended no evil, for her even course of existence had never been\ncrossed by those sudden tragedies, the impression of which no one ever\nentirely overcomes, which teach us to walk trembling along the ways of\nlife, lest each moment a gulf should open at our feet. Agatha had read\nof such misfortunes, but believed them only in books; to her the real\nworld, and her own fate therein, appeared the most monotonous thing\nimaginable. It never entered her mind to create an adventure or a\nmystery.\n\nShe waited another fifteen minutes--until the clock struck five, and the\nservant came up to her to announce dinner, and to know whether the same\ninformation should be conveyed to the gentlemen in the drawing-room.\nServants seem instinctively to guess when there is something\nextraordinary going on in a house, and the maid--as she found her\nmistress sitting in her bed-chamber, alone and thoughtful--wore a look\nof curiosity which made Mrs. Harper colour.\n\n\"Go down and tell your master--no, stay, I will go myself.\"\n\nShe waited until the maid had disappeared, and then went down-stairs,\nbut stopped at the drawing-room door, on hearing within loud voices,\nat least one voice--Major Harper's. He seemed pleading or protesting\nvehemently: Agatha might almost have distinguished the words, but--and\nthe fact is much to her credit, since her brother-in-law's apparently\nsane tones having suppressed her fears, she was now smitten with very\nnatural curiosity--but she stopped her ears, and ran up-stairs again.\nThere she remained, waiting for a lull in the dispute--in which,\nhowever, she never caught one tone of Nathanael's.\n\nAt last, feeling rather humiliated at being thus obliged to flutter up\nand down the stairs of her own abode, and crave admittance into her own\ndrawing-room, Mrs. Harper ventured to knock softly, and enter.\n\nFrederick Harper was sitting on the sofa, his head crushed down upon\nhis hands. Nathanael stood at a little distance, by the fireplace. The\nattitude of the elder brother indicated deep humiliation, that of the\nyounger was freezing in its sternness. Agatha had never seen such an\nexpression on Nathanael face before.\n\n\"What did you want?\" he said abruptly, thinking it was the servant who\nentered.\n\nShe could not imagine what made him start so, nor what made the two\nbrothers look at her so guiltily. The fact left a very uncomfortable\nimpression on her mind.\n\n\"I only came\"--she began.\n\n\"No matter, dear.\" Her husband walked up to her, speaking in a low\nvoice, studiously made kind, she thought \"Go away now--we are engaged,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"But dinner,\" she added. \"Will not your brother stay and dine with us?\"\n\nMajor Harper turned with an imploring look to his brother's wife.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Harper emphatically; held the door open for Agatha to\nretire, and closed it after her. Never in all her life had she been\ntreated so unceremoniously.\n\nThe newly-married wife returned to her room, her cheeks burning with no\ntrifling displeasure. She began to feel the tightening pressure of that\nchain with which her life was now eternally bound.\n\nBut, after five minutes of silent reflection, she was too sensible to\nnourish serious indignation at being sent out of the room like a mere\nchild. There must have been some good reason, which Mr. Harper would\nsurely explain when his brother left. The whole conversation was\nprobably some personal affair of the Major's, with which she had nothing\nto do. Yet why did her brother-in-law regard her so imploringly? It was,\nafter all, rather extraordinary. So, genuine female curiosity getting\nthe better of her, never did Blue Beard's Fatima watch with greater\nanxiety for \"anybody coming\" than did Agatha Harper watch at her window\nfor somebody going--viz., Major Harper. She was too proud to listen,\nor to keep any other watch, and sat with her chamber-door resolutely\nclosed.\n\nAt length her vigil came to an end. She saw her late guardian passing\ndown the street--not hastily or in humiliation, but with his usual\nmeasured step and satisfied air. Nay, he even crossed over the way to\nspeak to an acquaintance, and stood smiling, talking, and swinging his\ncane. There could not be anything very wrong, then.\n\nAgatha thought, having been once sent out of the room, she would not\nre-enter it until her husband fetched her--a harmless ebullition of\nannoyance. So she stood idly before the mirror, ostensibly arranging her\ncurls, though in reality seeing nothing, but listening with all her\nears for the one footstep--which did not come. Not, alas! for many, many\nminutes.\n\nShe was still standing motionless, though her brows were knitted in deep\nthought, and her mouth had assumed the rather cross expression which\nsuch rich, rare lips always can, and which only makes their smiling the\nmore lovely--when she saw in the mirror another reflection beside her\nown.\n\nHer husband had come softly behind her, and put his arms round her\nwaist.\n\n\"Did you think I was a long time away from you? I could not help it,\ndear. Let us go down-stairs now.\"\n\nAgatha was surprised that, in spite of all the tenderness of his manner,\nhe did not attempt the slightest explanation. And still more surprised\nwas she to find her own questions, wonderings, reproaches, dying\naway unuttered in the atmosphere of silentness which always seemed to\nsurround Nathanael Harper. This silentness had from the very beginning\nof their acquaintance induced in her that faint awe, which is the most\nominous yet most delicious feeling that a woman can have towards a\nman. It seems an instinctive acknowledgment of the much-condemned,\nmuch-perverted, yet divine and unalterable law given with the first\nhuman marriage--\"_He shall rule over thee_.\"\n\nAfter all that Agatha had intended to say, she said--nothing. She only\nturned her face to her husband, and received his kiss. Very soft it\nwas--even cold--as though he dared not trust himself to the least\nexpression of feeling. He merely whispered, \"Now, come down with me;\"\nand she went.\n\nBut on the staircase she could not forbear saying, \"I thought you two\nwould never have done talking. Is it anything very serious? I trust not,\nsince your brother walked down the street so cheerfully.\"\n\n\"Did he?--and--were you watching him?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" returned Agatha, for she had no notion of doing anything\nthat she would be afterwards ashamed to confess. \"But what put him into\nsuch a state of mind, and made him behave to me so strangely?\"\n\n\"How dared he behave?\" asked the husband, with quickness, then stopped.\n\"Forgive me. You know, I have never inquired--I never shall inquire\nabout anything.\"--Again he paused, seeing how his mood alarmed her. \"Do\nnot be afraid of me! Poor child--poor little Agatha!\"\n\nWaiting for no reply, he led her in to dinner.\n\nWhile the servants waited, Mr. Harper scarcely spoke, except when\nnecessary. Only in his lightest word addressed to Agatha was a certain\ntremulousness--in his most careless look a constant tender observance,\nwhich soothed her mind, and quite removed from thence the impression\nof his hasty and incomprehensible words. She laid all to the charge of\nMajor Harper and his unpleasant business.\n\nAt dessert, Nathanael sat varying his long silences with a few\ncommonplace remarks which showed how oblivious he was of all around\nhim, and how sedulously he tried to disguise the fact, and rise to the\nsurface of conversation. Agatha's curiosity returned, not unmingled with\na feeling tenderer, more woman-like, more wife-like, which showed itself\nin stray peeps at him from under the lashes of net brown eyes. At length\nshe took courage to say:\n\n\"Now--since we seem to have nothing better to talk about, will you tell\nme what you and your brother were plotting together, that you kept poor\nlittle me out of the room so long?\"\n\n\"Plotting together? Surely, Agatha, you did not mean to use that word?\"\n\nShe had used it according to a habit she had of putting a jesting form\nof phrase upon matters where she was most in earnest. She was amazed to\nsee her husband take it so seriously.\n\n\"Well, blot out the offending word, and put in any other you choose;\nonly tell me.\"\n\n\"Why do you wish to know, little Curiosity?\" said he, recovering\nhimself, and eagerly catching the tone his wife had adopted.\n\n\"Why? Because I am a little Curiosity, and like to know everything.\"\n\n\"That is both presumptuous and impossible, your ladyship! If one-half\nthe world were always bent on knowing all the secrets of the other half,\nwhat a very uncomfortable world it would be!\"\n\n\"I do not see that, even if the first half included the wives, and the\nsecond the husbands; which is apparently what you mean to imply.\"\n\n\"I shall not plead guilty to anything by implication.\"\n\nThey went on a few moments longer in this skirmish of assumed gaiety,\nwhen Agatha, pausing, leant her elbows on the table, and looked\nseriously at her husband,\n\n\"Do you know we are two very foolish people?\"\n\n\"Wherefore?\"\n\n\"We are pretending to make idle jests, when all the time we are both of\nus very much in earnest.\"\n\n\"That is true!\" And he sighed, though within himself, as though he did\nnot wish her to hear it. \"Agatha, come over to me.\" He held out both his\nhands; she came, and placed herself beside him, all her jesting subdued.\nShe even trembled, at the expectation of something painful or sorrowful\nto be told. But her husband said nothing--except to ask if she would\nlike to go anywhere this evening.\n\nAgatha felt annoyed. \"Why do you put me off in this manner, when I know\nyou have something on your mind?\"\n\n\"Have I?\" he said, half mournfully.\n\n\"Then tell it to me.\"\n\n\"Nay. I always thought it was wisest, kindest, for a man to bear the\nburden of his own cares.\"\n\nNathanael had spoken in his most gentle tone, and slowly, as if impelled\nto what he said by hard necessity. He was not prepared to see the sudden\nchildish burst of astonishment, anger, and resistance.\n\n\"From this, I understand, what you might as well have said plainly, that\nI am not to inquire what passed between you and your brother?\"\n\nHe moved his head in assent, and then sunk it on his left hand, holding\nout the other to his wife, as though talking were impossible to him, and\nall he wished were silence and peace. Agatha was too angry for either.\n\n\"But if I do not choose at nineteen to be treated like a mere child--if\nI ask, nay, _insist_\"--She hesitated, lest the last word might have\nirritated him too far. Vague fears concerning the full meaning of the\nword \"obey\" in the marriage service rushed into her mind.\n\nNathanael sat motionless, his fingers pressed upon his eyelids. This\nsilence was worse than any words.\n\n\"Mr. Harper!\"\n\n\"I hear.\" And the grave, sad eyes--and without any displeasure--were\nturned upon her. Agatha felt a sting of conscience.\n\n\"I did not mean to speak rudely to my husband; but I had my own reasons\nfor inquiring about Major Harper, from something Emma said to-day.\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"How eager you look! Nay, I can keep a secret too. But no, I will not.\"\nAnd the generous impulse burst out, even accompanied by a few childish\ntears and childish blushes. \"She told me he had probably lost money. I\nwished to say that if such a trifle made him unhappy he might take as\nmuch as he liked of mine. That was all!\"\n\nHer husband regarded her with mingled emotions, which at last all melted\ninto one--deep tenderness. \"And you would do this, even for him? Thank\nGod! I never doubted your goodness, Agatha. And I _trusted_ you always.\"\n\nWondering, yet half-pleased, to see him so moved, Agatha received his\noffered hand. \"Then all is settled. Now tell me everything that passed\nbetween you.\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\nGentle as the tone was, there was something in it which implied that\nto strive with Nathanael would be like beating against a marble wall.\nA great terror came over Agatha--she, who had lived like a wild bird,\nknowing no stronger will than her own. Then all the combativeness of her\nnature, hitherto dormant because she had known none worthy to contend\nagainst, awoke up, and tempted her to struggle fiercely with her chain.\n\nShe unloosed her hands and sprang from him. \"Mr. Harper, you are\nteaching me early how men rule their wives.\"\n\n\"I only ask my wife to trust me. She would, if she knew how great was\nthe sacrifice.\"\n\n\"What sacrifice? How many more mysteries am I to be led through\nblindfold?\"\n\nAnd her crimson cheek, her quick wild step across the room, showed a new\npicture to the husband's eyes--a picture that all young wives should be\nslow to let any man see, for it is often a fatal vision.\n\nNathanael closed his eyes--was it to shut it out?--then spoke, steadily,\nsorrowfully:\n\n\"We have scarcely been married a month. Are we beginning to be angry\nwith one another already?\"\n\nShe made him no answer.\n\n\"Will you listen to me--if for only two minutes?\"\n\nShe felt his step approaching, his hand fastening on hers, and replacing\nher in her chair. Resistance was impossible.\n\n\"Agatha, had I trusted you less than I do, I might easily have put off\nyour questions, or told you what was false. I shall do neither. I shall\ntell you truth.\"\n\n\"That is all I wish.\"\n\nNathanael said, with a visible effort, \"To-day I learnt from my\nbrother several rather painful circumstances--some which I was ignorant\nof--one\"--his voice grew cold and hard--\"one which I already knew, and\nknew to be irremediable.\"\n\nHis wife looked much alarmed; seeing it, he forced a smile.\n\n\"But what is irremediable can and must be borne. I can bear things\nbetter, perhaps, than most people. The other cares may be removed by\ntime and--silence. To that end I have promised Frederick to keep his\nconfidence secret from every one, even from my own wife, for a year to\ncome. A sacrifice harder than you think; but it must be made, and I have\nmade it.\"\n\nAgatha turned away, saying bitterly; \"Your wife ought to thank you! She\nwas not aware until now how wondrously well you loved your brother.\"\n\nThere was a heavy silence, and then Mr. Harper said, in a hoarse voice,\n\"Did you ever hear the story of a man who plunged into a river to save\nthe life of an enemy, and when asked why he did it, answered, 'It was\nbecause he _was_ an enemy?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" cried Agatha.\n\n\"No\"--her husband returned, hastily--\"better not. A foolish, meaningless\nstory. What were we talking about?\"\n\nHe--when her heart was bursting with vexation and wounded feeling--he\npretended to treat all so lightly that he did not even remember what\nthey were saying! It was more than Agatha could endure.\n\nHad he been irritated like herself--had he shown annoyance, pain--had\nthey even come to a positive quarrel--for love will sometimes quarrel,\nand take comfort therein--it would have been less trying to a girl of\nher temperament. But that grave superior calm of unvarying kindness--her\npoor angry spirit beat against it like waves against a shining rock.\n\n\"We were talking of what, had I considered the matter a month ago,\nI might possibly have saved myself the necessity of discussing or\npractising--a wife's blind obedience to her husband.\"\n\n\"Agatha!\"\n\n\"When I married,\" she recklessly pursued, \"I did not think what I was\ndoing. It is hard enough blindly to obey even those whom one has known\nlong--trusted long--loved long--but you\"--\n\n\"I understand. Hush! there needs not another word.\"\n\nAgatha began to hesitate. She had only wished to make him feel--to shake\nhim from that rigid quietude which to her was so trying. She had not\nintended to wound him so.\n\n\"Are you angry with me?\" she asked at length.\n\n\"No, not angry. No reproaches of yours can be more bitter than my own.\"\n\nShe was just about to ask him what he meant--nay, she even considered\nwhether her woman's pride might not stoop to draw aside the\ntight-pressed hands, entreating him to look up and forgive her and love\nher, when in burst Mrs. Thornycroft.\n\n\"Oh--so glad to catch you--have not a minute to spare, for James is\nwaiting. Where is your husband?\"\n\nMr. Harper had risen, and stood in the shadow, where his face was not\neasily visible. Agatha wondered to see him so erect and calm, while her\nown cheeks were burning, and every word she tried to utter she had to\ngulp down a burst of tears.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, it was you I wanted--to ask your decision about the\nhouse. A mere formality. But I thought I would just call as we went\nto grandmamma's, and then I can settle everything for you to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, but\"--\n\n\"Oh, perhaps you would rather see the house yourself! Quite right. Of\ncourse you will take it!\"\n\n\"I fear not.\"\n\nAgatha, as well as Mrs. Thornycroft, was so utterly astonished, that\nneither of them could make any observation. To give up the house, and\nall her dear home-visions! She was aghast at the idea.\n\n\"Bless me, what does your husband mean? Mr. Harper, what possible\nobjection?\"------\n\n\"None, except we have changed our plans. It is quite uncertain how long\nwe may stay at Kingcombe Holm, or where we may go from thence.\"\n\n\"Not to America, surely? You would not break your word to poor dear\nAgatha?\"\n\n\"I never break my word.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Harper, I declare I can't understand you,\" cried Emma,\nsharply. \"I only hope that Agatha does. Is all this with your knowledge\nand consent, my poor child?\"\n\nShe said this, eyeing the husband with doubt and the wife with\ncuriosity, as if disposed to put herself in the breach between the two,\nif breach there were.\n\nAgatha heard Nathanael's quick breathing--caught her friend's look of\npatronising compassion. Something of the dignity of marriage, the shame\nlest any third party should share or even witness aught that passes\nbetween those two who have now become one--awoke in the young girl's\nspirit. The feeling was partly pride, yet mingled with something far\nholier.\n\nShe put Emma gently aside.\n\n\"Whatever my husband's decision may be, I am quite satisfied therewith.\"\n\nMrs. Thornycroft was mute with amazement However, she was too\ngood-natured to be really angry. \"Certainly, you are the most\nextraordinary, incomprehensible young couple! But I can't stay to\ndiscuss the matter. Agatha, I shall see you to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes; I will bring her to you to-morrow,\" said Mr. Harper, cheerfully,\nas their visitor departed.\n\nThe husband and wife regarded one another in silence. At last he said,\ntaking her hand:\n\n\"I owe you thanks, Agatha, for\"--\n\n\"For doing my duty. I hope I shall never forget that.\"\n\nAt the word \"duty,\" so coldly uttered, Mr. Harper had let her hand fall\nHe stood motionless, leaning against the marble chimney-piece, his face\nas white as the marble itself, and, in Agatha's fancy, as hard.\n\n\"Have you, then, quite decided against our taking the house?\" she asked\nat length.\n\n\"I find it will be impossible.\"\n\n\"Why so? But I forget; it is useless to ask _you_ questions.\"\n\nHe made no reply.\n\n\"Pardon my inquiry, but do you still keep to your plan of leaving next\nweek for Dorsetshire?\"\n\n\"If you are willing.\"\n\n\"I willing?\" And she thought how, two hours before, she had rejoiced\nin the prospect of seeing her husband's ancestral home--her\nfather-in-law--her new sisters. Her heart failed her--the poor girlish\nheart that as yet knew not either the world or itself. She burst into\ntears.\n\nInstantly Mr. Harper caught her in his arms.\n\n\"Oh, Agatha, forgive me!--Have patience with me, and we may still\nbe happy; at least, you may. Only trust your husband, and love him a\nlittle--a very little--as much as you can.\"\n\n\"How can I trust you, whom I do not thoroughly understand? how can\nI--love\"--\n\nHer hesitation--her pride warring with the expression of that feeling\nwhich her very anger taught her was there--seemed to pierce her husband\nto the soul.\n\n\"I see,\" he said, mournfully. \"We are both punished, Agatha; I for the\nselfishness of my love towards you, and you--Alas! how can I make you\nhappier, poor child?\" Her tears fell still, but less with anger than\nemotion. \"I know now, we ought never to have been married. Yet, since we\nare married\"--\n\n\"Ay, since we are married, let us try to be good to one another, and\nbear with one another. I will!\"\n\nShe kissed his hand, which held up her drooping head, and Nathanael\npressed his lips on her forehead. So outward peace was made between\nthem; but in sadness and in fear, like a compact sealed tremblingly over\na newly-closed grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\"And this is Dorsetshire! What a sharp bleak wind!\" said Agatha,\nshivering.\n\nHer husband, who was driving her in a phaeton which had met them at the\nrailway station, turned to wrap a cloak round her.\n\n\"Except in the height of summer it is always cold across these moors.\nBut we shall soon be safe at Kingcombe Holm. Are you very tired?\"\n\nShe answered \"No,\" which was hardly the truth. Yet her heart was more\nweary than her limbs.\n\nDuring the few days that elapsed between Major Harper's visit and their\nquitting London, she had scarcely seen her husband. He had been\nout continually, coming home to dinner tired and exhausted, though\nafterwards he always tried to talk and be cheerful. To her surprise,\nMajor Harper never again called, nor, except in the brief answer to\nher question, \"that Frederick was gone from home,\" did Nathanael ever\nmention his brother's name.\n\n\"This is Kingcombe,\" said Mr. Harper, as they drove through a little\ntown, which Agatha, half blinded by the wind, scarcely opened her eyes\nto look at. \"My sister, Mrs. Dugdale, lives here. I thought they might\nhave met us at the station; but the Dugdales are always late. Ah, there\nhe is!\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"My brother-in-law, Marmaduke Dugdale--or 'Duke Dugdale,' as everybody\nabout here calls him. Holloa, Duke!\"\n\nAnd Agatha, through her blue veil, \"was ware,\" as old chronicles say,\nof a country-looking gentleman coming down the street in a mild, lazy,\ndreamy fashion, his hat pushed up at a considerable elevation from his\nforehead, leaving a mass of light hair straggling out at the back, his\neyes bent thoughtfully on the pavement, and his hands crossed behind\nhim.\n\n\"Holloa, Duke!\" cried Nathanael, for the second time, before he caught\nthe attention of this very abstracted personage.\n\n\"Eh--is it you? You don't say so! E--h!\"\n\nAgatha was amused by the long, sweet-sounding drawl of the last\nmonosyllable, which seemed formed out of all the five vowels rolled\ninto one. It was said in such a pleasant voice, with such a simple,\nchild-like air of delighted astonishment, that Agatha, conquering her\nshyness at this first meeting with one of her husband's family, peeped\nbehind Nathanael's shoulder at Mr. Dugdale.\n\nShe saw--what to her keen sense of beauty was a considerable shock--the\nvery plainest man she thought she had ever beheld!\n\n\"Mr. Dugdale--my wife.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Very glad to see her.\" And Agatha who was intending merely to\nbow, felt her hand buried in another thrice its size, which gave it a\nshy, gentle, but thoroughly cordial shake. \"And really, now I think of\nit, I was coming to meet you. The Missus told me to do it.\"\n\n\"How is 'the Missus?'\" asked Mr. Harper.\n\n\"Quite well--they're all waiting for you. So make haste--the Squire is\nvery particular as to time, you know!\"\n\nNodding to them both with a smile which diffused such an extraordinary\nlight over the uncomely face that Agatha was quite startled and began to\nreconsider her first impression regarding it,--\"Duke\" Dugdale turned to\nwalk on; but just as the horse was starting, came back again.\n\n\"Nathanael, you are here just in time--general election coming. You're a\nFree-trader of course?\"\n\n\"Why, I never thought much about the matter.\"\n\n\"Eh!--What a pity! But we'll convert you, and you shall convert your\nfather. Ah, yes--I think we'll get the Squire on our side at last\nGood-bye.\"\n\n\"Who is 'the Missus' and who is 'the Squire'\" asked Agatha, as they\ndrove off.\n\n\"'The Missus' is his wife--my sister Harriet, and 'the Squire' is my\nfather,\" said Nathanael, smiling. His face had worn a pleasant look ever\nsince he caught sight of Duke Dugdale's. \"When I first came home I was\nas much amused as yourself at these queer Dorsetshire phrases, but I\nlike them now; they are so simple and patriarchal.\"\n\nAgatha agreed; yet she could hardly help laughing. But though this\nbrother-in-law of Mr. Harper's--and she suddenly remembered that he\nwas her own brother-in-law too--used provincial words, and spoke with a\nslight accent, which she concluded was \"Dorset,\"--though his dress and\nappearance had an anti-Stultzified, innocent, country look, still there\nwas something about Marmaduke Dugdale which bespoke him unmistakably the\ngentleman.\n\n\"I am glad we met him,\" said Mr. Harper, looking back down the street.\n\"There he is, talking to a knot of people at the market-hall--farmers,\nno doubt, whom he will try to make Free-traders of, and who would listen\nto him affectionately, even if he tried to make them Mahometans. The\ngood soul! There isn't a better man in all Dorsetshire.\"\n\nIt was evident that Nathanael greatly liked \"Duke Dugdale.\"\n\nAgatha would have asked a score of questions; about his age, which\ndefied all guessing, and might have been anything from thirty to\nfifty-five--also about his \"Missus,\" for he looked like a man who never\ncould have made love, or thought of such a thing, in all his life. But\nher curiosity was restrained, partly by that of the old servant behind,\nwho kept up a close though reverential observance of all the sayings\nand doings of \"Ma-a-ester\" Nathanael's wife. She did not like even\naccidentally to betray how very little of Kingcombe her reserved husband\nhad told her, and how she knew scarcely more of his family than their\nnames.\n\nHaving parted from his brother-in-law, and gradually lost the benign\ninfluence which Duke Dugdale seemed to impart, Mr. Harper's face\nre-assumed that gravity, almost sadness, which, except when talking with\nherself, his wife now continually saw it wear.\n\nThey drove on, pushing against a fierce wind, that appeared like an\ninvisible iron barrier to intercept their way. Every now and then,\nAgatha could not help shivering and creeping closer to her husband;\nwhenever she did so, he always turned round and wrapped her up with most\nsedulous care.\n\n\"It is a dreary day for you to see our county for the first time,\nAgatha. If the sun were shining, these wide bleak sweeps of country\nwould look all purple with heather, and that dun-coloured, gloomy range\nof hills;--we must call them hills out of compliment, though they are so\nsmall--would stand out in a clear line against the sky. Beyond them lies\nthe British Channel, with its grand sea-coast.\"\n\n\"The sea--ah! always the sea.\"\n\n\"Nay, dear, don't be afraid, how don't'ee--as we Dorset people would\nsay. Kingcombe Holm lies in a valley. You would never know you were so\nnear the ocean. It is the same at Anne Valery's house.\"\n\n\"Where is that!\" said Agatha, brightening up at the mention of the name.\n\n\"Why, this animal seems inclined to show me--even if I did not know\nit of long habit,\" answered Mr. Harper, bestowing a little less of his\nattention on his wife, and more on the obstreporous pony, who, in regard\nto a certain turn of the road, had grown peculiarly wrong-headed.\n\n\"Don't'ee give in, sir! T'Squire bought he o' Miss Valery, and she do\ngi' un their own way, terrible bad,\" hinted the groom.\n\n\"Unfortunately, his own way happens to be a wrong one,\" said Nathannael,\nquietly, as he drew the reins tighter, and set himself to do that which\nit takes a very firm man to do to conquer an obstinate and unruly horse.\nAgatha remembered what she had heard or read somewhere about such a\ncase being no bad criterion of a man's character, \"lose your temper, and\nyou'll lose your beast,\" ay, and perhaps your own life into the bargain.\nShe was considerably frightened, but she sat quite still, looking from\nthe struggling animal to her husband, in whose fair face the colour\nhad risen, while the boyish lips were set together with a will, fierce,\nrigid, and man-like. She could hardly take her eyes from him.\n\n\"Agatha, are you afraid? Will you descend?\" asked he, suddenly.\n\n\"No--I will stay with you.\"\n\nThe struggle between man and brute lasted a minute or two longer, at the\nend of which, all danger being over, they were speeding on rapidly to\nKingcombe Holm. Agatha sat very thoughtful.\n\n\"I fear,\" she said--when he tried to draw her out of her contemplative\nmood, showing her the wild furzy slopes and the fir-trees, almost the\nonly trees that grow in this region--standing in black clumps on the\nhill-tops, like sentinel-ghosts of the old Romans, who used to encamp\nthere--\"I fear you have made _me_ as much in awe of you as you have the\npony.\"\n\nHe smiled, and was quoting something about \"love casting out fear,\" when\nhe suddenly corrected himself, and grew silent. In that silence they\nswept on to the gates of Kingcombe Holm.\n\nIt was a place--more like an ancient manorial farm than a gentleman's\nresidence--nestled snugly in one of those fairy valleys which are found\nhere and there among the bleak wastes of Dorsetshire coast scenery--the\nricher for the barrenness of all around. Before and behind the house\nrose sudden acclivities, thick with autumn-tinted trees. On another side\nwas a smooth, curving, wavy hill, bare in outline, with white dots of\ngrazing sheep floating about upon its green. The Holm, with its garden\nand park, lay on a narrow plain of verdurous beauty, at the bottom of\nthe valley. Nothing was visible beyond it, save a long, bare, terraced\nrange of hill, and the sky above all. There was no other habitation in\nsight, except a tiny church, planted on one acclivity, and two or three\nlabourers' cottages, in the doors of which a few rolypoly, open-eyed\nchildren stood, poking their fingers in their mouths, and staring\nintensely at Agatha.\n\n\"Oh, what a delicious nest,\" she cried--overcome with excitement at her\nfirst view of Kingcombe Holm, where, however, there was not a creature\nvisible but the great dog, that barked a furious welcome from the\ncourtyard, and the peacock, that strutted to and fro before the blank\nwindows, sweeping his draggled tail. \"Are they at home, I wonder? Will\nthey all be waiting for us?\"\n\n\"In the drawing-room, most likely. It is my father's way. He receives\nthere all strangers--new-comers, I mean. We shall see nobody till then.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure of that, brother Nathanael,\" said a quick, lively\nvoice. \"So, ho! Dunce, hold still, do'ee! You used to be as precise as\nthe Squire himself, bless his heart! Now then, N. L. Jump down!\"\n\nThe speaker of all this had come flying out of the hall-door--a vision\nof flounces, gaiety, and heartiness, had given the pony a few pats, or\nrather slaps, _en passant_, and now stood balancing herself on one of\nthe spokes of the wheel, and leaning over into the carriage.\n\n[Illustration: Arrival at Kingcombe Holm  p148]\n\n\"Is that you, Harrie? Agatha, this is my sister Mrs. Dugdale.\"\n\nAnd Agatha found herself face to face (literally speaking, too, for\n\"Harrie\" kissed her) with a merry-looking, pretty woman, of a style a\nlittle too _prononc\u00c3\u00a9e_ perhaps, for her features were on a similar mould\nto Major Harper's. Still, there could be no doubt as to the prettiness,\nand the airy, youthful aspect--younger, perhaps, than her years. Agatha\nwas perfectly astounded to find in this gay \"Harrie\" the wife of the\ngrave and middle-aged Duke Dugdale!\n\n\"You see, my dear--ahem! what shall I call you?--that I can't be formal\nand polite, and it's no use trying. So I just left my father sitting\nstately in the drawing-room with Mary on one side, as mistress of the\nhousehold; Eulalie on the other, looking as bewitching and effective as\nshe can, and both dying with curiosity to run out and see you. But I'm\nnot a Miss Harper now; so, while they longed to do it, I--did it. Here I\nam! Welcome home, Mrs. Locke Harper!\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" stammered the young bride, hardly knowing whether to laugh\nor to cry. Her husband was scarcely less agitated than herself, but\nshowed it only in the nervous trembling of his upper lip, and in the\nextreme brevity of his words. He lifted his wife down from the carriage,\nand Mrs. Dugdale, throwing back the blue veil, peered curiously into the\nface of her new sister.\n\n\"E--h!\" she said, in that long musical ejaculation just like her\nhusband--the only thing in which she was like him. Never was a pair\nwho so fully exemplified the theory of matrimonial opposites. \"E--h,\nNathanael!\" And her quick glance at her brother indicated undisguised\nadmiration of \"the Pawnee-face.\"\n\nHe himself looked restless, uncomfortable, as if his sister slightly\nfidgeted him; she had indeed, with all her heartiness, a certain\nquicksilverishness of manner, jumping here, there, and everywhere like\nmercury on a plate, in a fashion that was very perplexing at first to\nquiet people.\n\n\"Come along, my dear,\" continued Harrie, tucking the young wife under\nher arm--\"come and beautify a little--the Squire likes it. And run\naway to your father, N. L., my boy!\" added she to her younger\nbrother--younger--as a closer inspection of her fresh country face\nshowed--possibly by some five or six years.\n\nMr. Harper assented with as good a grace as he could, and resigned his\nwife to his sister.\n\nFor the next ten minutes Agatha had a confused notion of being taken\nthrough many rooms and passages, hovered about by Mrs. Dugdale, her\nflounces, and her lively talk--of trying to answer a dozen questions per\nminute, and being so bewildered, that she succeeded in answering none,\nsave that she had met Mr. Dugdale--that she did _not_ think him \"a\nbeauty,\" and (she hastily and in terror added this fact) that there was\nnot the least necessity for his being so.\n\n\"Not the least, my dear. I always thought the same! You'll love him\nheartily in a week--I did! Bless him for a dear, good, ugly, beautiful\nold soul!\"\n\nHere Agatha, who stood listening, and nervously arranging the long curls\nthat _would_ fall uncurled and untidy, felt a renewal of her old girlish\nenthusiasm for all true things; her eyes brightened, and her heart\nwarmed towards \"Harrie.\" She would have liked to stay talking longer,\nbut for a vision of Mr. Harper waiting uncomfortably down-stairs.\n\n\"So you have finished adorning, and want to go! You can't bear to be ten\nminutes away from your husband, that's clear! Well, my dear, you'll get\nwiser when you have been married as long as I have. But I don't know,\"\nadded Mrs. Dugdale laughing; \"I'm always glad enough to get rid of Duke\nfor an hour or two; yet somehow, when he is away, I'm always wanting\nhim. By-the-by, did he happen to say what time he was coming over\nhere--only to see you, you know? He has quite enough of 'the Missus.'\"\n\nAgatha laughingly asked how long \"the Missus\" had borne that title.\n\n\"Couldn't possibly count! Look at Gus and Fred in jacket and trousers,\nand little Brian learning to ride. Frightful antiquity! And yet when\nI married I was a girl like you; only ten times wilder--the greatest\nharum-scarum in the county! I often wonder poor Duke was not afraid to\nmarry me! Heigho! Well, here we are down-stairs, and here--take your\nwife, most solemn brother Nathanael! If you were but a little more like\nFrederick! By the way, have you seen Fred lately?\"\n\n\"He has left town,\" said Mr. Harper, shortly, as he drew his young\nwife's arm through his own, and led her to his father's presence.\n\nAgatha was conscious of a tall, thin, white-haired gentleman--not unlike\nMajor Harper frozen into stately age--who rose and came to meet her.\n\n\"I am most happy to welcome my son's wife to Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\nAgatha felt the withered fingers touching her own--the kiss of welcome\nformally sealed on her forehead. She trembled exceedingly for a moment,\nbut recovered herself, and met old Mr. Harper's keen observant gaze with\none as clear and as composed as his own. One glance told her that he was\nnot the sort of man into whose fatherly arms she could throw herself,\nand indulge the emotion brimming over in her heart. But his examination\nof her was evidently favourable.\n\n\"You are most welcome, believe me. And my daughters\"--here he turned to\ntwo ladies, of whom Agatha at first distinguished nothing, save that\none was very pretty, the other much older, and plain--\"my daughters,\nreceive your new sister.\" Here the ladies aforesaid approached and shook\nhands, the plain one very warmly.--\"You also can tell her how truly glad\nwe are to receive--Mrs. Harper.\"\n\nHe hesitated a little before the latter word, and pronounced it with\nsome tremulousness, as though the old man were thinking how many years\nhad passed since the name \"Mrs. Harper\" had been unspoken at Kingcombe\nHolm.\n\nHis daughters looked at one another--even Harriet observing a grave\nrespect No one spoke, or took outward notice of the circumstance; but\nfrom that time the subject of much secret conjecture was set at rest,\nand Agatha was called by every one \"Mrs. Harper.\"\n\nDuring the somewhat awkward quarter of an hour that followed, in which\nthe chief conversation was sustained by \"the Squire,\" and occasionally\nby Nathanael--Mrs. Dugdale having vanished--the young girl observed\nher two sisters-in-law. Neither struck her fancy particularly, perhaps\nbecause there was nothing particular to strike it. The Misses Harper\nwere, like most female branches of \"county families,\" vegetating on\ntheir estates from generation to generation in uninterrupted gentility\nand uniformity. Of the two, Agatha liked Mary best; for there was great\ngoodnature shining through her fearless plainness--a sort of placid\nacknowledgment of the fact that she was born for usefulness, not\nornament. Eulalie, on the contrary, carried in her every gesture a\ndisagreeable self-consciousness, which testified to her long assumption\nof one character--the beauty of the family. Despite Agatha's admiration\nof handsome women in general, she and the youngest Miss Harper eyed one\nanother uncomfortably, as if sure from the first that they shall never\nlike one another.\n\nAll this while Nathanael spoke but little to his wife, apparently\nleaving her to nestle down at her own will among his family. But he kept\ncontinually near her, within reach of a word or glance, had she given\nhim either; and she more than once felt his look of grave tenderness\nreading her very soul. She could not think why, in spite of all his\nefforts to the contrary, he should be continually so serious, while she\nwas quite ready to be happy and at ease.\n\nThere was one thing, however, which gave her keen satisfaction--the\ngreat honour in which her husband was evidently held by his family.\n\nVery soon a heterogeneous post-prandial repast was announced for the\nbenefit of the travellers; to which Mr. Harper graciously bade them\nretire--even leading his daughter-in-law to the dining-room door.\n\n\"He'll not come further in,\" whispered Mrs. Dugdale, who made herself\nmost active about Agatha. \"You arrived at seven, and my father would\nas soon think of changing his six o'clock dinner hour as he would of\nchanging his politics; for all Duke says to the contrary.\"\n\nAgatha was not sorry, since the idea of dining under the elaborate\nkindness and dignified courtliness of old Mr. Harper was rather\nalarming. Besides, she was so hungry!\n\nThe moment her father-in-law had closed the door, the sisters came\ngathering like bees round herself and her husband, Mary busy over every\npossible physical want, Harrie, sitting at, or rather, on the table. She\nhad a wild and not ungraceful way of throwing herself about--rattling on\nlike a very Major Harper in petticoats, and flinging away _bon mots_ and\nwitty sayings enough to make the fortune of many a \"wonderfully clever\nwoman,\"--the very last character which this light-spirited country-lady\nwould probably have imagined her own. For Eulalie, she had relaxed\ninto a few words, and fewer smiles, the quality of neither being of\nsufficient value to make one regret the quantity. Nobody minded her much\nbut Mary, who was motherly, kind, and reverential always to the inane\nbeauty.\n\nSuch were Agatha's first impressions of her new sisters. With a shyness\nnot unnatural she had taken little notice of her husband. He had chatted\namong his sisters, with whom he seemed very popular: but always in the\nintervals of talk the pale, grave, tired look came over him.\n\nIn quitting the dining-room--where Agatha, irresistibly led on by Mrs.\nDugdale's pleasantness, had begun to feel quite at home, and had laughed\ntill she was fairly tired out--he said, in a half whisper:\n\n\"Now, dear, I think we ought to go and see Elizabeth.\"\n\nIn the confusion of her arrival, Agatha had forgotten that there was\nanother sister--in truth, the Miss Harper of the family--Mary, its head\nand housekeeper, being properly only \"Miss Mary.\" She noticed that as\nNathanael spoke, the other three looked at him and herself doubtfully,\nas if to inquire how much she knew--and anxiously, as though there\nwere something painful and uncomfortable in a stranger's first seeing\nElizabeth.\n\nMrs. Harper felt her cheeks tingle nervously, but still she put her arm\nin her husband's, and said, \"I should much like to go.\"\n\nMary sent for lights, and prepared to accompany them herself, the other\ntwo moving away into the drawing-room.\n\nThrough the same sort of old-fashioned passages, but, as it seemed, to\nquite a different part of the house, Agatha went with her husband and\nhis sister. The strangeness and gloom of the place, the doubt as to what\nsort of person she was going to see--for all she had heard was that from\nsome great physical suffering Elizabeth never quitted her room--made\nthe young girl feel timid, even afraid. Her hand trembled so that her\nhusband perceived it.\n\n\"Nay, you need not mind,\" he whispered. \"You will see nothing to pain\nyou. We all dearly love her, and I do believe she is very happy--poor\nElizabeth!\"\n\nAs he spoke Mary opened a door, and they passed from the dark staircase\ninto a large, well-lighted, pleasant room--made scrupulously pleasant,\nAgatha thought. It was filled with all sorts of pretty things,\nengravings, statuettes, vases, flowers, books, a piano; even the paper\non the walls and the hangings at the window were of most delicate\nand careful choice. No rich drawing-room could show more taste in its\narrangements, or have a more soothing effect on a mind to which the\nsense of \u00c3\u00a6sthetic fitness is its native element.\n\nAt first, Agatha thought the room was empty, until, lying on a\nsofa--though so muffled in draperies as nearly to disguise all form--she\nsaw what seemed at first the figure of a child. But coming nearer, the\nface was no child's face. It was that of a woman, already arrived at\nmiddle age. Many wrinkles seamed it; and the hair surrounding it in\nsoft, close bands, was quite grey. The only thing notable about the\ncountenance was a remarkable serenity, which in youth might have\nconveyed that painful impression of premature age often seen in similar\ncases, but which now in age made it look young. It was as if time\nand worldly sorrow had alike forgotten this sad victim of Nature's\nunkindness--had passed by and left her to keep something of the child's\nparadise about her still.\n\nThis face, and the small, thin, infantile-looking hands, crossed on the\nsilk coverlet, were all that was visible. Agatha wondered she had so\nshrunk from the simple mystery now revealed.\n\nNathanael led her to the sofa, and placed her where Elizabeth could see\nher easily without turning round.\n\n\"Here is my wife! Is she like what you expected, sister?\"\n\nThe head was raised, but with difficulty; and Agatha met the cheerful,\nsmiling, loving eyes of her whom people called \"poor Elizabeth.\" Such\nthorough content, such admiring pleasure, as that look testified! It\ntook away all the painful constraint which most people experience on\nfirst coming into the presence of those whom Heaven has afflicted thus;\nand made Agatha feel that in putting such an angelic spirit into that\npoor distorted body, Heaven had not dealt hardly even with Elizabeth\nHarper.\n\n\"She is just what I thought,\" said a voice, thin, but not unmusical.\n\"You described her well. Come here and kiss me, my dear new sister.\"\n\nAgatha knelt down and obeyed, with her whole heart in the embrace. Of\nall greetings in the family, none had been like this. And not the least\nof its sweetness was that her husband seemed so pleased therewith,\nlooking more like himself than he had done since they entered his\nfather's doors.\n\nThey all sat down and talked for a long time, Elizabeth more cheerfully\nthan any. She appeared completely versed in the affairs of the whole\nfamily, as though her mind were a hidden gallery in which were clearly\ndaguerreotyped, and faithfully retained, all impressions of the external\nworld. She seemed to know everybody and everybody's circumstances--to\nhave ranged them and theirs distinctly and in order, in the wide, empty\nhalls of her memory, which could be filled in no other way. For, as\nAgatha gradually learned, this spinal disease, withering up the form\nfrom infancy, had been accompanied with such long intervals of acute\nphysical pain as to prevent all study beyond the commonest acquirements\nof her sex. It was not with her, as with some, that the intellect\nalone had proved sufficient to make out of a helpless body a noble\nand complete human existence; Elizabeth's mind was scarcely above the\naverage order, or if it had been, suffering had stifled its powers. Her\nonly possession was the loving heart.\n\nShe asked an infinitude of questions, her bright quick eyes seeming to\nextort and gain more than the mere verbal answers. She talked a good\ndeal, throwing more light than Agatha had ever before received on the\nmanners, characters, and history of the Harper family, the Dugdales, and\nAnne Valery. But there was in her speech a certain reticence, as though\nall the common gossip of life was in her clear spirit received, sifted,\npurified, and then distributed abroad in chosen portions as goodly and\npleasant food. She seemed to receive the secrets of every one's life and\nto betray none.\n\nAgatha now learnt why there had been such a mystery of regret,\nreverence, and love hanging over the very mention of the eldest Miss\nHarper.\n\nWhen the tumult of this strange day had resolved itself into silence,\nAgatha, believing her husband fast asleep, lay pondering over\nit, wondering why he had not asked her what she thought of his\nfamily--wondering, above all, what was the strange weight upon him which\nhe tried so hard to conceal, and to appear just the same to every one,\nespecially to her. Her coming life rose up like a great maze, about\nwhich all the characters now apparently mingled therein wandered mistily\nin and out. Among them, those which had gained most vivid individuality\nin a fancy not prone to catch quick interests, affecting her alternately\nwith a sense of pensive ideal calm, and cheerful healthy human liking,\nwere Elizabeth Harper, the \"Missus,\" and Duke Dugdale.\n\nLikewise, as an especial pleasure, she had discovered the one to whom\nshe clung as to a well-known friend among all these strangers, lived\nwithin eight miles of Kingcombe Holm.\n\n\"And\"--she kept recurring to a fact spread abroad in the house just\nbefore bed-time, and apparently diffusing universal satisfaction--\"and\nAnne Valery is sure to be here to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nOn the morning--her first morning at Kingcombe Holm--Mrs. Harper woke\nrefreshed to a bright day. All the terraced outline of the hills was\npencilled distinctly against the bluest of blue skies, which hung like\na tent over the shut-up valley. She stood at the window looking at it,\nwhile Mary Harper made the breakfast and Eulalie curiously examined\nAgatha's dress, supposed to be the latest bridal fashion from London.\nNathanael sat writing letters until breakfast was ready, and then took\nhis father's place at the foot of the table.\n\n\"Elizabeth bade me ask you,\" said Mary, addressing him, \"if you had any\nletters this morning from Frederick? You know she likes to look at all\nfamily letters--they amuse her. Shall I take this one?\"\n\nNathanael put his hand upon a heap, among which was plainly\ndistinguishable Major Harper's writing. \"No, Mary--not now. If\nnecessary, I will read part of it to Elizabeth myself.\"\n\nAgatha, who had before vainly asked the same question, was annoyed by\nher husband's reserve. His silence in all his affairs, especially those\nrelating to his brother, was impenetrable.\n\nBut this was rousing in her, day by day, a strong spirit of opposition.\nHad not the presence of his sisters restrained her, for her external\nwifely pride grew as much as her inward antagonism--she would have again\nboldly put forward her claim to read the letter. As it was, she had\nself-control enough to sit silent, but her mouth assumed that peculiar\nexpression which at times revealed a few little mysteries of her\nnature--showing that beneath the quietude and simplicity of the girl lay\nthe strong, desperate will of a resolute woman.\n\nAfter breakfast, when Mr. Harper, with some slight apology, had gone to\nhis letters again, she rose, intending to stroll about and explore\nthe lawn. She had never been used to ask any one's permission for her\nout-goings and in-comings, so was departing quite naturally, when Mary\nstopped her.\n\n\"I hope you will not mind it, but we always stay in the house until my\nfather comes down-stairs. He likes to see us before he begins the day.\"\n\nAgatha submitted--with a good grace, of course; though she thought\nthe rule absolute was painfully prevalent in the Harper family. But as\nhalf-an-hour went by, and the morning air, so fresh and cool, tempted\nher sorely, she tried to set aside this formal domestic regulation.\n\nMary looked quite frightened at her overt rebellion.--\"My dear Mrs.\nHarper--indeed we never do it. Do we, Nathanael?\" said she, appealingly.\n\nHe listened to the discussion a moment.--\"My dear wife, since my father\nwould not like it, you will not go, I know.\"\n\nThe tone was gentle, but Agatha would as soon have thought of\noverleaping a stone wall as of opposing a desire thus expressed. She\nsat quietly down again--or would have done so, but that she saw Eulalie\nsmile meaningly at her sister. Intercepting the young wife, the smile\nchanged into affected condolence.\n\n\"Nathanael will have his way, you see. If you only knew what he was as\na little boy,\" and the Beauty shrugged her shoulders pathetically.\n\"Really, as Harrie says, most men would never get wives at all, did\ntheir lady loves know them only half as well as their sisters do.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the good-natured Mary, \"but Harrie also says that men, like\nwine, improve with age, especially if they are kept cool and not\ntoo much shaken up. She has no doubt that even her Duke was a very\ndisagreeable boy. So, Mrs. Harper, let me assure you\"------\n\n\"There is no need; I am quite satisfied,\" said Mrs. Harper, with no\nsmall dignity; and at this momentous crisis her father-in-law entered\nthe room.\n\nHe entered dressed for riding--looking somewhat younger than the night\nbefore, more cheerful and pleasant too, but not a whit less stately. He\nsaluted Agatha first, and then his daughters, with a gracious solemnity,\npatting their cheeks all round, something after the fashion of a\ngood-humoured Eastern bashaw. The old gentleman evidently took a secret\npride in his womenkind. Then he shook hands with \"my son Nathanael,\"\nand threw abroad generally a few ordinary remarks, to which his two\ndaughters listened with great reverence. But in all he did or said was\nthe same benignant hauteur; he seemed frozen up within a conglomerate\nof reserve and formal courtesy; he walked, talked, looked perpetually as\nNathanael Harper, Esquire, of Kingcombe Holm, who never allowed either\nhis mind or his body to appear _en d\u00c3\u00a9shabille_. Agatha wondered how he\ncould ever have been a baby squalling, a boy playing, or a young man\nwooing; nay, more (the thought irresistibly presented itself as she\nnoticed the extreme feebleness which his dignity but half disguised),\nhow he would ever stoop to the last levelling of all humanity--the\ngrave-clothes and the tomb.\n\n\"Any letters, my dear children? Any news to tell me before I ride\nto Kingcombe?\" said he, looking round the circle with a patronising\ninterest, which Agatha would scarcely have believed real, but for the\nkindly expression of the old man's eye.\n\n\"There were plenty of letters for Elizabeth, as usual; one for Eulalie\n\"--here Eulalie looked affectedly conscious--\"no others, I think.\"\n\n\"Except one to Nathanael from Frederick,\" observed the Beauty.\n\nAt the name of his eldest son the Squire's mien became a little\ngraver--a little statelier. He said coldly, \"Nathanael, I hope you have\npleasant news from your brother. Where is he now?\"\n\n\"In the British Channel, on his way to the Continent.\"\n\n\"My son going abroad, and I never heard of it! Some mistake, surely. He\nis not really gone?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, for a year, or perhaps more--but certainly a year.\"\n\nThe old gentleman's fingers nervously clutched the handle of his\nriding-whip. \"If so, Frederick would certainly have shown his father the\nrespect of informing _him_ first. Excuse me if I doubt whether my son's\nplans are quite decided.\"\n\n\"They are indeed, sir,\" said Nathanael gently. \"And I was aware of,\nindeed advised, this journey. He bids me explain to you that when this\nletter arrives he will be already gone.\"\n\nThe father started--and broke the whip he was playing with. He stood\na minute, the dull red mounting to his temples and lying there like\na cloud. Then he took the fragments of the riding-whip from his son's\nready hand--thanked him--bade good morning to the womenkind all round,\nand left them.\n\n\"Shall I ride with you, father?\" said Nathanael, following him to the\nhall-door, with a concerned air.\n\n\"Not to-day--I thank you! Not to-day.\"\n\nMary and Eulalie looked at one another. \"This will be a sad blow to\npapa,\" said the former. \"Frederick was always a great anxiety to him.\"\n\nAgatha inquired wherefore.\n\n\"Because papa abhors a gay 'vagabondising' life, and always wished\nhis eldest son to settle down in the county. I know--though he says\nnothing--that this has been a sore point between them for nearly twenty\nyears.\"\n\n\"And I know,\" added Eulalie, mysteriously, \"that papa was going to make\na last effort, and have Frederick proposed as member for Kingcombe. A\npretty fight there would have been--papa and Frederick against Marmaduke\nand his pet candidate!\"\n\n\"'Tis well that is prevented! Everything happens for the best,\" said\nMary, sagely. \"But here comes Nathanael. Don't tell him, Mrs. Harper, or\nhe would say we had been gossiping.\"\n\nMrs. Harper was standing moralising on the ins and outs of family life,\nfrom which her own experience had hitherto been so free. Her eyes were\nwandering up the road, where her father-in-law had just disappeared,\nriding slowly, but erect as a young man. While she looked, there came up\none of those delicious little country pony-carriages, which a lady can\ndrive, and make herself independent of everybody.\n\n\"It is Anne Valery!\" was the general cry, as all ran to meet her at the\ndoor--Agatha being the first.\n\n\"My dear--my dear!\" murmured Anne Valery, leaning out of her little\ncarriage to pat the brown curls. \"Are you quite well?--quite happy? And\nyour husband?\" She glanced from one to the other, with a keen inquiry.\n\"Is all well, Nathanael?\"\n\nNathanael, smiling at his wife, whose look of entire pleasure brought,\nas usual, the reflection of the same to him also, answered, warmly,\n\"Yes, Anne, all is well!\"\n\nShe seemed satisfied, and took his hand to dismount from her carriage.\nAgatha noticed that she walked more feebly, in spite of the bright\ncolour which the wind had brought to her cheeks; and that soon after she\ncame into the house this tint gradually faded, leaving her scarcely even\nso healthy-looking as she had appeared a month ago--the last time they\nhad seen her. But her talk was full of cheerfulness.\n\n\"I am come to stay the whole day with you, by your father's desire--and\nmy own. May I, Mary?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! We shall be so glad, especially Elizabeth, who was wondering\nand longing after you.\"\n\n\"I have not been well. London never suits me,\" said Anne carelessly.\n\"But come, now I am about again, let me see what is to be done to-day.\nIn the first place, I must have a long talk with Elizabeth. Is she risen\nyet, Eulalie?\"\n\nEulalie did not know; but Mary added, that she feared this was one of\nElizabeth's \"hard days,\" when she could not talk much to any one till\nevening.\n\nAnne continued, after a pause--\"I want to drive over to Kingcombe about\nsome business. I have had so much on my hands since poor Mr. Wilson's\ndeath.\"\n\n\"Anne's steward,\" whispered the Beauty importantly to her sister-in-law.\n\"You know that half Kingcombe belongs to Anne Valery?\" And Agatha\nnoticed, with some amusement, what an extreme deference was infused into\nthe usually nonchalant, contemptuous manner of the youngest Miss Harper.\n\n\"So poor Wilson is dead! And who have you to manage all your property?\"\nasked Mr. Harper suddenly.\n\n\"No one at present I am very particular in my choice. As I am only a\nwoman, my steward has necessarily considerable influence. I would\nwish him always to be what Mr. Wilson was: if possible a friend, but\nundoubtedly a gentleman.\"\n\nAs Miss Valery spoke, Nathanael listened in deep thought; then, meeting\nher eyes, he coloured slightly, but quickly recovering himself, said, in\na low tone, \"Some time to-day, Anne, I would like to have a little talk\nwith you.\"\n\nShe assented with an inquiring look. But she seemed to understand\nNathanael well enough to content herself with that look, asking no\nfurther questions.\n\n\"And, for the third important business which should be done to-day,\nand perhaps the sooner the better, I must certainly take Agatha up Holm\nHill, and show her the view of the Channel.\"\n\nAgatha drew back from the window. \"Ah, not the sea!--I cannot bear the\nsea.\" Anne Valery watched her with peculiar earnestness.\n\n\"Were you ever on the sea, my dear?\"\n\n\"Once, long ago.\"\n\n\"Nay, I must teach you to admire our magnificent coast. On with your\nbonnet, and come along that great hill-terrace--do you see it?--with\nNathanael and me.\"\n\n\"But you will be tired,\" Mrs. Harper said, reluctant still, yet loth to\nresist Anne Valery.\n\n\"Tired? no! The salt breeze gives me strength--health. I hardly live\nwhen I am not in sight of the Channel. Make haste, and let us go,\nAgatha.\"\n\nShe seemed so eager, that no further objection was possible. So they\nsoon started--they three only, for Mary had occupation in the house, and\nthe Beauty was mightily averse to exercise and sea-air.\n\nThey climbed the steep road, overhung with trees, at whose roots grew\nclusters of large primrose leaves, showing what a lovely walk it must\nbe in spring; then higher, till all this vegetation ceased, leaving\nonly the short grass cropped by the sheep, the purple thistles, and the\nfurze-bushes, yellow and cheerful all the year round. They then drove\nalong a high ridge for a mile or two, till they got quite out of sight\nof Kingcombe Holm. Miss Valery talked gaily the whole way; and, as\nthough the sea-breeze truly gave her life, was the very first to propose\nleaving the carriage and walking on, so as to catch the earliest glimpse\nof the Channel.\n\n\"There!\" she said, breathlessly, and quitting Mr. Harper's arm, crossed\nover to his wife. \"There, Agatha!\"\n\nIt was such a view as in her life the young girl had never beheld. They\nstood on a high ridge, on one side of which lay a wide champaign of\nmoorland, on the other a valley, bounded by a second ridge, and between\nthe two sloping greenly down, till it terminated in a little bay.\nParallel to the valley ran this grand hill-terrace--until it likewise\nreached the coast, ending abruptly in precipitous gigantic cliffs,\nagainst which the tides of centuries might have beat themselves in vain.\nBeyond all, motionless in the noonday dazzle, and curving itself away\nin a mist of brightness where the eye failed, was the great, wide,\nimmeasurable sea.\n\nThe three stood gazing, but no one spoke. Agatha trembled, less with\nher former fear than with that awestruck sense of the infinite which is\nalways given by the sight of the ocean--that ocean which One \"holdeth\nin the hollow of his hand.\" Gradually this awe grew fainter, and she\nwas able to look round her, and count the white dots scattered here and\nthere on the dazzling sheet of waves.\n\n\"There go the ships,\" said Nathanael. \"See what numbers of\nthem--numbers, yet how few they seem!--are moving up and down on this\nhighway of all nations. Look, Agatha, at that one, a mere speck, dipping\nin the horizon.\n\n\"Do you remember Tennyson's lines?--they reached Uncle Brian and me even\nin the wild forests of America:\n\n     \"'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail\n     Which brings our friends up from the under world;\n     Sad as the last which reddens over one\n     That sinks, with all we love, below the verge.'\"\n\n\"There! it is gone now,\" cried Agatha, almost with a sense of loss. She\nfelt Anne Valery's fingers tighten convulsively over her arm, and saw\nher with straining eyes and quivering lips watching the vanishing--nay,\nvanished--ship, as if all her soul were flying with it to the \"under\nworld.\"\n\nThe sight was so startling, so moving--especially in a woman of Miss\nValery's mature age and composed demeanour--that Nathanael's wife\ninstinctively turned her eyes away and kept silence. In a minute or two\nAnne had returned to Mr. Harper's arm, and the three were walking on as\nbefore; until, ere long, they nestled themselves in a sheltered nook,\nwhere the sea-wind could not reach them, and the sun came in, warm as\nsummer.\n\nNathanael began to show his wife the different points of\nscenery--especially the rocky island of Portland, beyond which the line\nof coast sweeps on ruggedly westward to the Land's End.\n\n\"But I believe,\" he said, \"that there is nowhere a grander coast than we\nhave here--not even in Cornwall.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Cornwall,\" Miss Valery said, closely observing Nathanael,\n\"I lately heard a sad story about some mines there.\"\n\nMr. Harper seemed restless. \"The speculation had failed, having been\nill-managed, or, as I greatly fear, a cheat from the beginning. As I had\nproperty near in the county--what, did you not know that, Nathanael--I\nwas asked to do something for the poor starving miners of Wheal\nCaroline. Have you heard the name, Agatha?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Agatha, innocently, not paying much attention, except to the\nlovely view.\n\n\"Not heard? That is strange. But you, Nathanael\"--\n\n\"I know all,\" he said hastily. \"It is a sad history--too sad to be\ntalked of here. Another time\"--\n\nHis eye met hers--and both turned upon Agatha, who sat a little apart,\nenjoying the novel scene, and rejoicing above all that the sea--vague\nobject of nameless terror--could ever appear so beautiful.\n\n\"Poor child!\" murmured Miss Valery.\n\n\"Hush, Anne!\" Nathanael whispered, so imploringly--nay, commandingly,\nthat Anne was startled.\n\n\"How like you are to\"--\n\n\"What were you saying?\" asked Agatha, turning at last.\n\n\"I was saying,\" Miss Valery replied hastily--\"I was saying how like\nNathanael looked just then to his Uncle Brian.\"\n\n\"Did he indeed? Was that all you were speaking of?\"\n\n\"Not quite all; but I find your husband knows the story; he will tell\nyou, _as he ought_,\" added Anne pointedly.\n\n\"Surely I will, one day,\" said Nathanael. \"But in this case, as in many\nothers, where there has been misfortune or wrong, I consider the best,\nwisest, most charitable course is not to spread it abroad until the\nwrong has had a chance of being remedied. Do you not think so, Anne?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, her eyes fixed upon the resolute young face\nthat seemed compelling her to silence almost against her will. It was\nmarvellous to see the influence Nathanael had, even over Anne Valery.\n\n\"And now,\" continued Mr. Harper, \"while I am alone with you and my\nwife\"--here he drew Agatha within the circle of talk, and made her lean\nagainst his knee, his arm shielding her from the wind--\"I wanted to\ntalk with you, Anne, about some plans I have.\"\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"I have given up--as Agatha wrote you word--all idea of our settling at\nMontreal. It is necessary that I should at once find some employment in\nEngland.\"\n\n\"Not yet--not just yet,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I must, dear. It is right--it is necessary. Anne herself would say so.\"\n\nMiss Valery assented, much to Agatha's surprise.\n\n\"The only question then is--what can I do? Nothing in the\nprofessions--for I have acquired none; nothing in literature--for I\nam not a genius; but anything in the clear, straightforward,\nman-of-business line--Uncle Brian used to accuse me of being so very\npractical.--Anne,\" he added, smiling, \"I wish, instead of having to puff\noff myself thus, Uncle Brian were here to advertise my qualifications.\"\n\n\"Qualifications for what?\" inquired Agatha, Miss Valery being silent\n\n\"For obtaining from my friend here what I would at once have applied for\nto any stranger; poor Wilson's vacant post as her overseer, land-agent,\nsteward, or whatever the name may be.\"\n\n\"Steward!\" cried Mrs. Harper. \"Surely you would never dream of being a\nsteward?\"\n\n\"Why not? Because I am unworthy of the situation, or--as I fear my proud\nlittle wife thinks--because the situation is not worthy of me? Nay, a\nman never loses honour by earning his bread in honourable fashion;\nand Miss Valery herself said that for this office she required both a\ngentleman and a friend. Will she accept me?\"\n\nAnd he extended, proudly as his father might--yet with a frank\nindependence nobler than the pride of all the Harpers--his honest right\nhand. Anne Valery took it, the tears rising in her eyes.\n\n\"I could never have offered you this, Nathanael; but since you are so\nsteadfast, so wise----Yes! it is indeed, considering all things, the\nwisest course you can pursue. Only, I will agree to nothing unless your\nwife consents.\"\n\n\"I will not consent,\" said Agatha, determinedly.\n\nThere was an uncomfortable pause.\n\n\"I see in your plan no reason--no right,\" continued she, forgetting\nin her annoyance even the outward deference with which her sense of\nconjugal dignity led her invariably to treat her husband. \"Why was I\nnever told this before?\"\n\n\"Because I never thought of it myself until this morning.\"\n\nThe exceeding gentleness of his tone surprised her, and restrained many\nmore words, not over-sweet, which were issuing from her angry lips.\n\n\"The fact is, Agatha--I may speak before Anne Valery whom we both\nlove\"--\n\n\"And who loves you both as if you had been her own kindred.\"\n\nThese words, so tremulously said, swept away a little bitterness that\nwas rising up in Agatha's heart against Miss Valery.\n\n\"It is necessary,\" Mr. Harper went on--\"imperatively so, for my\ncomfort--that I should at once do something. And in choosing\none's work, it always seemed to me there was great wisdom in the\nrule--'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.' Many\nthings I could not do; this I can, well and faithfully, as Anne will\nfind. Nor need I feel ashamed of being steward to Miss Valery.\"\n\nAgatha felt her spirit of opposition quaking on its throne. \"But your\nfather--your sisters. What will they all say at Kingcombe Holm?\"\n\n\"Nothing that I cannot combat. My father will be glad of our settling\nnear him in Dorsetshire.\"\n\n\"In Dorsetshire!\" echoed Mrs. Harper dolefully; and thereupon fled her\nlast visions of a gay London home. Yet she already liked her husband's\ncounty and people well enough to bear the sacrifice with tolerable\nequanimity.\n\n\"And whatever he says, whatever any one else says, I have no fear, if\nmy wife will only stand by me, and trust that I do everything for the\nbest.\"\n\nHis wife listened, not without agitation, for she remembered their first\ndispute, only a few days ago. Here was rising another storm. Yet either\nshe felt weaker to contend, or something in Nathanael's manner lured\nher to believe him in the right. She listened--only half-convinced, yet\nstill she listened.\n\nAnne Valery did the same, though she took no part in the argument Only\ncontinually her eyes wandered to Nathanael, less with smiling heart-warm\naffection than with the pensive tenderness with which one watches a dead\nlikeness revived in a living face.\n\nAt last, when he had expressed all he could--everything except entreaty\nor complaint--Mr. Harper paused. \"Now, Agatha, speak.\"\n\nShe felt that she must yield, yet tried to struggle a little longer. She\nhad been so unused to control.\n\n\"You should have consulted with me--have explained more of your reasons,\nwhich as yet I do not comprehend. Why should you be so wondrously\nanxious to begin work? It is unreasonable, unkind.\"\n\n\"Am I unkind to you, my poor Agatha?\" His accent was that of unutterable\npain.\n\n\"No! no! that you never are! Only--I suppose because I am young and\nlately married--I do not half understand you. What must I do, Miss\nValery?\"\n\nAnne looked from one to the other--Nathanael, who, as was his habit\nin all moments of great trial, assumed an aspect unnaturally hard--and\nAgatha whose young fierce spirit was just bursting out, wrathful, yet\nhalf repentant all the while. \"What must you do? You must try to learn\nthe lesson that every woman has to learn from and for the man she\nloves--to have faith in him.\"\n\n\"We women,\" she continued softly, \"the very best and wisest of us,\ncannot enter thoroughly into the nature of the man we love. We can only\nlove him. That is, when we once believe him worthy of affection. Firmly\nknowing that, we must bear with all the rest; and where we do not quite\nunderstand, we must, as I said, _have faith in him_. I have heard of\nsome women whose faith has lasted all their life.\"\n\nAnne's serious smile, and the beautiful steadfastness of her eyes, which\nvaguely turned seaward--though apparently looking at nothing--made a\ndeep impression on the young wife.\n\nShe answered, thoughtfully, \"I believe in my husband too, otherwise\nI would not have married him. Therefore, since our two wills seem to\nclash, and he is the older and the wiser--let him decide as he thinks\nbest--I will try to 'have faith in him.'\"\n\nNathanael grasped her hand, but did not speak--it seemed impossible to\nhim. Soon after, they all rose and turned homeward, leaving the breezy\nterrace and the bright sunshiny sea. None turned to look back at either,\nexcepting only--for one lingering, parting glance--Anne Valery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nThe same afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Harper and Miss Valery drove to\nKingcombe, to see if in that quaint little town there was a house\nsuitable for the young couple. They had not said a word to either of\nthe Miss Harpers concerning this sudden arrangement, agreeing that the\nfather of the household ought to be shown the respect of receiving the\nfirst information.\n\n\"And then,\" said Nathanael, \"I trust mainly to Anne Valery to overcome\nhis scruples. Anne can do anything she likes with my father. Don't you\nremember,\" he continued, leaning over to the front seat where the two\nladies were, and looking quite cheerful, as though a great load had\nbeen taken off his mind--\"don't you remember--I do, though I was such\na little boy--how there was one day a grand family tumult because\nFrederick wanted his commission, and my father refused it--how you\nwalked up and down the garden, first with one and then with the other,\npersuading everybody to be friends, while Uncle Brian and I\"--\n\n\"There, that will do,\" said Miss Valery. \"Never mind old times, but let\nus look forward to the future. Here we are at Kingcombe. Agatha, how do\nyou like the place?\"\n\nAnd Agatha, on this glowing autumn afternoon, eagerly examined her\nfuture home.\n\nIt was a rather noteworthy country town; small, clean, with an air of\nsober preservation, reminding one of a well-kept, dignified, healthy\nold age. It wore its antiquity with a sort of pride, as if its quaint\nstreets, intersecting one another in cruciform shape, still kept\nthe impress of mediaeval feet, baron's or priest's, in the days when\nKingcombe had sixteen churches and a castle to boot--as if the Roman\nwalls which enclosed it lay solemnly conscious that, at night, ghosts\nof old Latin warriors glided over the smooth turf of those great earthen\nmounds where the town's-children played. Even the very river, which came\nup to the town narrow and slow, with perhaps one sailing-barge on it\nvisible far across the flat country, and looking like a boat taking an\ninsane pedestrian excursion over the meadows--even the river seemed to\nrun silently, as if remembering the time when it had floated up Danish\nships with their fierce barbarian freight, and landed them just under\nthat red sand-cliff, where the lazy cows now stood, and the innocent\nblackberry-bushes grew.\n\nIt was a curious place Kingcombe, or so Agatha thought.\n\n\"How strange it is,\" Mr. Harper observed. \"All these old spots seem to\nme like places beheld in a dream. Uncle Brian often used to talk about\nthem. I think to this day he remembers everything and everybody about\nKingcombe.\"\n\n\"Does he?\"\n\n\"And that some day or other he will come back again I do most firmly\nbelieve. Do not you, Anne?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" As she spoke, her hand involuntarily was pressed upon her side.\nAgatha wondered she responded so coldly and with so melancholy a look,\nto such a joyous prospect as Uncle Brian's return would surely be to all\nthe family.\n\nBut here they were in Kingcombe streets--very quiet, sleepy streets,\nwhich seemed to have taken an undisturbed doze for a few centuries, to\natone for the terrible excitements there created successively by\nDanish, Roman, Saxon, and baronial ruffians. The poor little town seemed\ndetermined to spend its old age in peace and solitude, for you might\nhave planted a cannonade at the market-place, and swept down East\nStreet, West Street, North Street, and South Street, without laying\nmore than a dozen official murders on your soul. There was indeed great\nreason for Mrs. Harper's innocent inquiry--\"Where are all the people\ngone to?\"\n\n\"Except on market-days, we rarely see more street passengers than now in\nKingcombe,\" Aline Valery answered, smiling. \"You will get accustomed to\nthat and many other things when you are a country lady. Now, shall we\ndrive to the Dugdales, or look first at the two houses I told you of?\"\n\nMr. Harper preferred the latter course, under fear, his wife merrily\ndeclared, of being circumvented by Mrs. Dugdale. The brother and\nsister, she had already discovered, seemed on as pleasant terms as fire\nand water, since, as Harrie punningly averred, one invariably \"put out\"\nthe other. They did not squabble--Nathanael Harper never squabbled--but\nthey always met with a gentle hissing, like water sprinkled on coals.\nAgatha, who was quite new to these harmless fraternalities, always\noccurring in large families, was mightily amused thereat.\n\nThe first house the little party looked over was, as Emma Thornycroft\nwould have phrased it, \"a love of a place!\" Dining-room, drawing-rooms,\nconservatory, gardens--quite a gentleman's mansion. Agatha set her heart\nupon it at once, and it blotted out even her lingering regret over the\nlost home in the Regent's Park. She ran over the rooms with the glee\nof a child, and only came back to her husband to urge him to take it,\ngiving her this thing and that thing necessary to its beautification.\n\nHe patted her cheek with a pleased yet sad look.\n\n\"Dear, I will give you all I can; be quite sure of that. But\"--\n\n\"Nay, no buts; I must have this house. Besides, Miss Valery says it is\nthe only house to let in Kingcombe.\"\n\n\"Except the one I showed you as we passed.\"\n\n\"Oh, that mean little cottage--impossible. We could never think of\nliving there.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, let us look at it. You know we are but just beginning the\nworld, and 'small beginnings make great endings' as Uncle Brian would\nsagely observe. Come along, my little wife.\"\n\nShe tried to slip from his hand and appeal to Miss Valery, but Anne\nhad moved forward, and left them alone. There was no resource; and even\nwhile Agatha's spirit was rather restive under the coercion, she could\nnot but acknowledge the pleasantness with which it was enforced.\n\n\"Well, I'll go with you, but I hereby declare rebellion. I will not have\nthat miserable nutshell of a house,\" said she, laughing.\n\nYet it was a pretty nutshell--quite after the \"love in a cottage\"\nfashion--though adorned and perfected by the late Mr. Wilson, an old\nbachelor.\n\n\"Did he die here?\" asked Agatha.\n\n\"No; in Cornwall,\" Anne answered. \"He had gone over to look at some\nproperty I have lately bought there. The people on it, miners thrown\nout of work, gave him more anxiety than he could bear, for he was not\nstrong. He said their misery broke his heart.\"\n\nMiss Valery spoke softly, but the words caught Nathanael's ear. He\nlooked greatly shocked--and said, in a low tone, \"Anne, don't talk of\nthis. If I live, the wrong shall be atoned for.\"\n\nAgatha wondered for the moment what wrong there was which made her\nhusband look so pained and humbled. But she forbore to ask questions,\nand again turned her attention to the house.\n\n\"It must have been a charming nest for an old bachelor, and I would have\nliked it very much myself had I been an old maid. But it would never do\nfor _us_, you know.\"\n\nNathanael smiled, so loth to contradict her, or thwart her pretty ways.\n\n\"Don't you see, Miss Valery;\" Agatha continued, gathering apprehensions\nfrom his silence, smiling though it was--\"Don't you see how different\nthe cases are? This little house might do very well for Mr. Wilson,\nbut then if my husband takes his place as your steward, it is only for\namusement. We are rich people, you know.\"\n\n\"My poor child!\" began Anne Valery, looking regretfully, nay,\nreproachfully at Mr. Harper. But he whispered as he passed:\n\n\"Not yet, Anne--for my father's sake--the whole family's--nay, her own.\nNot just yet!\"\n\nSuch was his earnestness, such his air of command, that, for the\nsecond time, Anne, looking in his face and reading the old likeness\nthere--obeyed him.\n\nAgatha, wondering, uncomfortable, recommenced what she jestingly called\n\"her little rebellion.\" \"I see, Mr. Harper, your heart is inclining to\nthis place, though why or wherefore I cannot tell. But do incline it\nback again! We must have the other house--that delicious Honeywood.\"\n\n\"My dear little wife! Nobody could live at Honeywood under a thousand a\nyear.\"\n\n\"Well, and have we not that? I am sure I thought I had more money than\never I could do with. How much have I?\"\n\nHe hesitated--she fancied it was at the thoughtless \"I,\" and generously\nchanged the expression.\n\n\"How much have _we?_\"\n\n\"Enough--I will make it enough--to keep you from wanting anything, and\ngive you all the luxuries to which you were born. But not enough to\nwarrant us in living at Honeywood. I cannot do it--not even for your\nsake, Agatha.\"\n\n\"I do not see the matter as you do.\"\n\n\"You cannot, dear! I know that. But in this one thing--when, on various\naccounts, I can judge better than she can--will not my wife trust me?\"\n\nAnd Anne Valery's glance seemed to echo, \"Trust him.\"\n\nAgatha, tried to the utmost of her small stock of patience, grew more\nbitter than she could have believed it possible to be with her husband\nand Anne Valery.\n\n\"You expect too much,\" she said, sharply. \"I cannot trust, even though I\nmay be compelled to obey.\"\n\nMr. Harper turned round anxiously. \"Agatha, what must--what can I\ndo? No,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can do nothing.\" He walked to the\nwindow, and stood looking out mutely on the little garden--tiny, but so\npretty, with its green verandah, its semicircle of arbutus trees\nserving as a frame to the hilly landscape beyond, its one wavy acacia,\nwoodbine-clasped, at the foot of which a robin-redbreast was hopping and\nsinging over the few fallen leaves.\n\nWhile they all thus stood, there came a light foot and a flutter of\ndraperies to the door.\n\n\"My patience! what are you all doing here? So, Agatha--Anne! How d'ye\ndo, my worthy brother? Why didn't you all come to our house?\"\n\n\"We were coming directly,\" Agatha said. \"But how did you find out we\nwere at Kingcombe?\"\n\n\"You little London-lady! As if anybody, especially the much-beloved Anne\nValery (saving her presence) and the much-wondered-at Mr. and Mrs. Locke\nHarper, could drive through Kingcombe without the fact being speedily\ncirculated throughout the whole town? Why, my dear, if you must know,\nthe grocer told Mrs. Edwards' nursemaid, and Mrs. Edwards' nursemaid\ntold it to Mrs. Jones at the Library, and Mrs. Jones told Miss\nTrenchard, who was coming to call on me; so I asked Duke to give the\nchildren their dinner, and off I started, tracking you as cleverly as\none of Nathanael's Red Indians. And here I am.\"\n\nShe stopped, breathless, her flounces, veil, and shawl flying abroad in\nall directions. But she looked so hearty, natural, and good-humoured,\nthat her entrance was quite a relief to Agatha--more especially as, for\na great wonder, she asked no questions.\n\n\"So, I hear you have been showing Honeywood to Mrs. Harper. Pretty\nplace, isn't it! A pity it's not on your property, Anne, or you would\nnot let it go to ruin unlet. And here is poor Mr. Wilson's old house,\nwith all the furniture just as it was. How melancholy!\"\n\nShe said \"How melancholy!\" just in the tone that she would have\nsaid \"How entertaining!\" From circumstances, or from natural\npeculiarity--that light easy temper which dances like a feather over the\ntroubled waters of life--she had evidently never learnt the meaning of\nthe word sorrow.\n\n\"But now,\" Harriet continued, \"what I come for, is to carry you all off\nto lunch--the children's dinner. My dear, you must see my boys, your\nnephews.\"\n\nAgatha stood aghast at the idea of having nephews!\n\n\"And such boys!\" Miss Valery added, interposing. \"'The Missus' has\ngood right to be proud of them. If there is one thing in which Harrie\nsucceeds better than another, it is in the management of her children.\"\n\n\"Bah! they manage themselves; I just leave them to nature,\" cried Mrs.\nDugdale; but her eye--the mother's eye--twinkled with pleasure all the\ntime, which greatly improved its expression, Agatha thought. She walked\noff gaily with her sister-in-law, Nathanael following. Anne stayed\nbehind, conversing with the old woman who showed the house. She and Mr.\nHarper had pointedly avoided any private speech with one another.\n\n\"I declare there is Duke!\" cried Mrs. Dugdale suddenly. \"Just look at\nhim, meandering up and down the town.\" (Agatha laughed at the word;\n\"meandering\" seemed so perfectly expressive of Duke Dugdale.) \"But\nmy husband always turns up everywhere, except where he's wanted. Does\nyours? I beg your pardon--since you are watching him as if you thought\nhe were running away. Nonsense, Agatha--(I always call everybody by\ntheir Christian names)--Nonsense! He's only shaking hands with his\nbrother-in-law, both looking as pleased as ever they can look.\"\n\nThe next moment Harrie and Agatha came up with the two gentlemen at\nthe door of Mr. Dugdale's house. They were talking politically and\nearnestly, as men will do--Nathanael having apparently forgotten the\nbitter cloud of a few minutes since, which yet lay heavy on his wife's\nheart. At least it seemed so, and his indifference made her angry.\n\nNeither spoke to their wives--being busy laying their heads together\nover a newspaper--until Harrie very unceremoniously began to pull at her\nhusband's coat, which he bore for a time in perfect obliviousness. At\nlast he turned and patted her with his great hand, just as some sage,\nmild Newfoundland dog would coax into peace the attacks of a wild young\nkitten.\n\n\"Nay, now, Missus--don't'ee, love; I'm busy.--And you see, Nathanael,\nas your brother is sure not to canvass or try for the town, and as Mr.\nTrenchard is such a fine fellow, your father's friend too, don't you\nthink we could coax him round? By conviction, of course: Trenchard\nwouldn't take any man's votes except upon conviction.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he?\" said Nathanael, smiling at the simple-minded politician,\nwho believed that everybody's politics were as honest as his own. At\nwhich unpropitious moment a number of half-drunken men, with \"Vote\nfor Trenchard!\" stuck round their broken hats, came round the corner\nshouting:\n\n\"Hurrah for Free-trade! Duke Dugdale for ever! Bravo!--and give us a\nshilling! Amen!\"\n\n\"You see now what comes of your politics,\" cried his wife, trying to\npull him into the hall. But the good man still stood, bareheaded, a\nperplexed expression troubling his face.\n\n\"It's very odd, now: I made Trenchard promise not to give them a penny\nfor drink. Poor fellows! if they only knew better! But I'll tell'ee what\nit is, Nathanael,\" and he used the slight Dorset accent, which always\nbroadened when he was very earnest, \"those lads drink because they are\nstarving--drink drowns care. If they had Free-trade they wouldn't be\nstarving: if they were not starving they wouldn't drink. Therefore,\nhurrah for Free-trade, and, my poor fellows, here's your shilling!\nOnly don't'ee let it go for more drink'; and, hark'ee, remember it's no\nbribery money o' Mr. Trenchard's, its _mine_.\n\n\"Thank'ee, zir, thank'ee; hurrah for Duke Dugdale and Free-trade!\"\nshouted the men as they staggered off.\n\nMr. Dugdale stood looking after them with that mild benevolent smile\nwhich made his ugly face quite beautiful--at least Agatha thought\nso;--which was very generous in her, seeing he had not taken the least\nnotice of her all this while; when he did, it was in the most passing\nway.\n\n\"Eh--what, Missus? did you say Mrs. Harper was here?\" He shook hands\nwith her, looking in another direction;--then again turned to Nathanael.\n\n\"Utterly useless!\" cried Harrie, laughing. \"He's more misty than usual\nto-day. Let us leave the men alone, stupid bears as they are! and come\nup-stairs to the children.\"\n\nAll this time no one asked or looked for Miss Valery, who had lingered\nbehind, bidding them go forward. It seemed the habit of the family that\nshe should be left to go about in her own fashion, interfered with by\nnobody, and attended by nobody, save when she came among them to do them\ngood. It was not wonderful; since, having passed that time of youth when\na pleasant woman is everybody's petted darling, she had lived to feel\nherself alone in the world--wife, sister, and child to no one. It always\ntakes a certain amount of moral courage to meet that destiny.\n\nAided by the beneficial influence of dinner, which in the Dugdales'\nhouse seemed to have the mysterious property of extending over an\nindefinite time, Agatha had succeeded in making friends with her\n\"nephews\" to say nothing of a lovely little niece, who would persist in\nputting chubby arms round \"Pa's\" neck, and dividing his attention sorely\nbetween Free-trade and rice-pudding. Mr. Harper had taken another child\non his knee, and was cutting oranges and doing \"Uncle Nathanael\" to\nperfection. His wife stole beside him with affection. Why would he not\nbe always as now? Why was he so good, so gentle to others, yet so hard\nto be understood by her? Was it her own fault? She almost believed so.\n\nOn this group, all happy, all united together by those lovely links in\nthe chain of happiness--little children--Anne Valery entered. She passed\nround the table, having a word, or smile, or kiss for all. Then she\nwent to an arm-chair, looking tired, though joining all the while in the\nconversation, particularly with Mr. Dugdale, who seemed to have a great\nregard for her.\n\n\"Ah, Miss Valery, I wish you were a man, and could vote for us!\" said\nhe, peering from underneath the baby-hands which made a pointed Norman\narch over \"Pa's\" eyes. \"You'd be sure to vote on the right side. Didn't\nwe make a convert of you, Brian and I, years before people talked of\nFree-trade; long before he went out, and I got married to mamma there?\nEh, Brian, my lad\"--and he patted his youngest boy, throned on\nMr. Harper's knee--\"if you only grow up such a wise man as your\ngrand-uncle!\"\n\nAgatha was amused to see how the idea and recollection of Uncle Brian\nhad permeated through every branch of the Harper family. Almost every\nfamily has some such personage, mythical, sublime, exciting the wonder\nand hero-worship of all the young people. Little Brian opened wide his\nlarge grey eyes at the mention of his honoured namesake.\n\nBut while he gazed, his papa's pudding-laden spoon stopped half-way on\nits journey to the baby-mouth that was waiting for it--Duke Dugdale was\nin a reverie. He did not even hear the little clamourer on his knee.\n\n\"Really, now, that's very odd, very odd indeed.\" And he felt anxiously\nin his pocket. \"No, I had another coat on that day--mamma, where's my\ngrey overcoat?\"\n\n\"Duke--what on earth are you talking about? Now, Agatha, confess--isn't\nmy husband the very vaguest, mistiest man you ever knew? Oh, you dear\nold visionary, what do you want with grey overcoats at dinner-time?\"\n\nHe smiled patiently--perhaps he did not even hear--put down his little\ngirl, and walked out of the room, his wife anxiously jumping up and\nfollowing with some pathetic exclamation about \"Duke's being so cross!\"\nWhich seemed to Agatha the most amusing exaggeration possible.\n\nIn a minute or two this most opposite couple--opposite, but fitting like\na dovetailed joint--came in merrily together, Harrie holding a letter.\n\n\"Would you believe, he got it last week, has been carrying it about ever\nsince, and never thought of it! There, Nathanael, it's yours! Devour\nit!\"\n\n\"From Uncle Brian!\" cried the young man. At which name there ran a great\nsensation throughout the family, in all but Miss Valery, who still kept\nher chair.\n\n\"News! news!\" cried Harrie, Agatha and the boys gathering round. Mr.\nDugdale walked up and down the room--his hands behind him--smiling in\nbenevolent content at everybody and at nobody. Brian and his tiny sister\nconsoled themselves for the little attention they got by slily climbing\non the table and embedding their fingers in the rice-pudding.\n\nNathanael read the letter aloud, as seemed to be the family custom with\nUncle Brian's correspondence.\n\n\n\"My dear Boy,\" I find the Western solitudes are no nearer heaven than\ncivilisation. My two red friends having escaped and got back, which they\ndid on purpose to tomahawk me--I gave the tribe the slip, and am here in\nNew York. There I accidentally received your letter.\n\n\"You are a foolish boy. When I was young, I think I would rather have\ndied than have married a rich woman, even if she loved me, which no\nwoman ever did. Nevertheless, I hope you will fare better than you\ndeserve.\n\n\"Shall you ever come back to America? Not on my account, I pray, though\nI miss you, and am getting old and lonely. Perhaps it is as well that\nyou left me, and have married and settled. That seems to me now the\nhappier, worthier life for a man to lead. I should like to come and see\nyou, if I could come not quite the beggar I am now. Therefore, I often\nthink I shall go to California.\"\n\nThere was a light movement among the listening group, as Miss Valery was\nfound quietly to have joined them, and to be leaning over Nathanael's\nshoulder. He pointed his finger to the letter that she might read it\nwith him. She moved her head in thanks, and he continued:\n\n\"If in this or any other form of the mad gold-fever I can heap up a\nlittle of that cursed--I mean blessed dust, you may possibly see me in\nEngland. Till then--or till death--which seems equally likely, I remain,\n\n\"Your affectionate Uncle,\n\n\"Brian Locke Harper.\n\n\"P.S.--I send this through Marmaduke Dugdale's late agent in New York.\nTell my old friend Duke that I congratulate him on having given up\nmerchandising, so that my brother at Kingcombe Holm can no longer\nreproach him with being the only one of the Harper connection who\n_earns_ a livelihood.\"\n\n\nThis letter, which was trying to read, being sharp and stinging on many\npoints to more than one person present, Nathanael went steadily through,\nthough several times his colour changed. No one made any comment\nexcept Agatha, who observed \"that Uncle Brian must be rather bitter and\nsarcastic at heart.\"\n\n\"No--not bitter,\" Anne Valery said,--\"only sorrowful. It is often so,\nwhen after a hard life men feel themselves growing old. What shall you\ndo, Nathanael?\"\n\n\"About what? His going to California? Nay, I cannot prevent that. What\nuse in my writing when he gives me such lectures about my marriage?\"\n\n\"He would not if he knew Agatha. Besides, in this doctrine he is a\nlittle wrong. It is of small moment on which side lies the wealth;--love\nmakes all things even.\"\n\nMr. Harper turned away with one of those uneasy looks which Agatha had\nalready begun to notice and speculate over. She made up her mind that\nat the first possible opportunity she would muster up courage, and claim\nher right as a wife to know her husband's whole heart.\n\nThe epistle produced a considerable change on the family group. The boys\nwere clamorous to know all about California, and whether Uncle Brian\nwould not come home in a gold ship with silver sails; on which subject\nNathanael was too full of his own thoughts to give much satisfactory\ninformation. Mr. Dugdale had walked out of the window into the garden\nbehind, where Miss Valery followed him, and they two were seen strolling\nup and down in close conversation. As they passed the window, Agatha\nnoticed that. Anne Valery's cheeks were slightly flushed, and that Mr.\nDugdale's \"mistiness\" of manner had assumed an unusual clearness. He was\nshaking his companion warmly by the hand.\n\n\"Anne, what a wise woman you are! Such a plan would have been years in\ncoming into _my_ head. And it's just the very thing. It will give him\noccupation and independence without hurting his pride. Moreover\"--and a\nsudden thought dilated his whole countenance with pleasure--\"I shouldn't\nwonder if it brought him home.\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'll remember, we must be very particular. By-the-by,\nAnne\"--here a bright idea seemed to strike the worthy man--\"what a help\nhe would be to us against the Protectionists! Wouldn't _he_ see the\nblessing of Free-trade?\"\n\nAnne smiled, with her finger on her lip to stop the conversation; and\nthey stepped in at the window;--Mrs. Harper taking care to glide away,\nlest they should suspect what she had so unintentionally heard. It was\ndoubtless one of Miss Valery's numerous anonymous charities, which fell\nas abundant and unnoticed as rain.\n\n\"Now\"--and Anne startled her godchild Brian by turning up his little\nrosy chin and kissing him--\"now, who will come back with us to that\ngrand family-dinner which the Squire has set his heart upon, and Aunt\nMary is so busy-about to-day at Kingcombe Holm?\"\n\nAll soon started; Agatha being kidnapped, not much against her will,\nby her gay sister-in-law, and driven across the moors at such a\nhelter-skelter pace that Nathanael, who had insisted upon following them\non horseback, received his wife at the door with an evident thanksgiving\nthat she had reached home alive.\n\nMiss Valery's little equipage came leisurely on behind. Nobody asked\nwhat she and Duke Dugdale had conversed about; but Harrie shrewdly\nsuspected he had been talking poor dear Anne to death about the votes\nof her Kingcombe tenantry, and the probable chances of Mr. Trenchard and\nFree-trade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTo see the elder Mr. Harper sitting at the head of his own dinner-table\nwas a real pleasure. He never looked so well at any other time. His\ngrandiose air was then so mixed with genuine kindliness that it only\nenriched his courtesies, like the \"body\" in mellow old wine. He leaned\ngraciously back in the arm-chair peculiarly his own, surveying the long\ntable shone over by soft wax-lights, and circled by smiling faces, most\nof them women, as the old gentleman liked best. Even the plain Mary,\ntaking the foot of the table, looked well and mistress-like in her black\nvelvet dress: Eulalie and Mrs. Dugdale kept up the good appearance of\nthe family; while Miss Valery and the young Mrs. Harper took either side\nof the host, and were duly honoured by him.\n\nAgatha wore her wedding-dress, of white silk, rich and plain, She looked\nvery pretty, her girlish _abandon_ of manner softened by a certain\nwifely dignity, which grew upon her day by day. She filled her position\nwell, though often with secret trembling, and shy glances over to her\nhusband to see if he were satisfied with her--a fact which no one but\nherself could doubt.\n\n\"Now, my children,\" said the Squire, when the servants had withdrawn,\nand dessert and wines foretold the chatty hour after dinner of which he\nwas so fond--\"now, my children--I may call you all so?\" and he smiled at\nAnne Valery--\"let me tell you how glad I am to see you, and especially\nthe youngest of you\"--here he softly patted Agatha's hand, on the table.\n\"And since we always drink healths here--a good old fashion that I\nshould be loth to renounce--let me give you the first toast--Mr. and\nMrs. Nathanael Locke Harper!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Mr. Dugdale vaguely from the bottom of the table,\nat which indecorum--probably occasioned by a county meeting that was\nrunning in his head--his father-in-law looked extremely severe. But the\nseverity was soon drowned in the nods and smiles that circled round.\nAfter which Nathanael said briefly but with feeling:\n\n\"Father, my brother and sisters, and Anne--my wife and I thank you all\"\n\n\"What do you think of this our old-fashioned custom?'\" said the Squire,\nturning to his daughter-in-law. \"A remnant of my young days, when every\nlady used to be called upon to give the health of a gentleman, and every\ngentleman of a lady. It was always so at your grandfather's table,\nAnne, where many a time when you were a baby in long-clothes I had the\npleasure of giving yours.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Anne, smiling. She was evidently a great favourite\nwith the old gentleman.\n\n\"You should know, my dear daughter-in-law, that my acquaintance with\nthis lady dates almost from her birth. And for nineteen years I held\nover her the right which I understand my eldest son\"--he paused a\nmoment--\"which Major Harper had the honour to hold over you. Her\ngrandfather left me his executor and sole guardian of his infant\nheiress. I was a young man then, but I tried to deserve his trust. Did\nI, Anne?\"\n\nAgain she smiled--most affectionately.\n\n\"And I had the pleasure of seeing my ward at twenty-one the richest\nheiress and the truest gentlewoman in the west of England. She did me\ninfinite credit, and I had fulfilled to my friend one of the most sacred\ntrusts a man can receive. Your excellent grandfather Anne--let us drink\nhis memory.\"\n\nReverently and in silence the old Squire raised the glass to his lips--a\nglass filled with only water--he never took wine.\n\n\"You see, my dear young lady, how this old custom brings back all lost\nor absent friends. We never forget them, and like to talk of them and\nof old times. Thus, always at this hour, we gather round us innumerable\npleasant recollections, and remember all who are dear to us or to our\nguests at Kingcombe Holm.--Now, Mrs. Harper, we wait your toast.\"\n\nAgatha coloured, felt nervous and ashamed, glanced at her husband, but\nmet nothing except an encouraging smile. She thought--remembering\nher own few ties--that she would gratify Nathanael by naming some one\nnearest to him. So she looked up timidly, and gave \"Uncle Brian.\"\n\nEvery one applauded--the Squire graciously acknowledging the compliment\nto his brother.\n\n\"The youngest and only surviving brother of many, and as such, much\nregarded by me,\" he explained to his daughter-in-law. \"In spite of\nthe great difference in our ages, and some trifling opposition in our\ncharacters, I cherish the highest esteem for my brother Brian.\" And\nhereupon he asked for the letter received that day; which was duly read\naloud by his son--saving the wise omission of the postscript.\n\n\"Go to California?\" said old Mr. Harper, knitting his brows. \"I do not\nlike that--it is unbecoming a gentleman. Though he was wild and daring\nenough, Brian never yet forgot he was a gentleman. Was it not so, Anne?\"\n\nAnne assented.\n\n\"He was a fine generous fellow, too. Do you remember how a week before\nhe left us so suddenly he rode fifty miles across the country to get\nsome ice for you in your fever? You were very ill then, my poor girl.\"\nIt was touching to hear him call Miss Valery a \"girl\"--she whom the\nyoung Agatha regarded as quite an elderly woman.\n\n\"And though he did leave us so abruptly--wherefore, remains to this day\na mystery, unless it was a young man's whim and love of change--still I\nhave the greatest dependence on Brian Harper,\" continued the Squire, who\nseemed as a parental right to monopolise all the talk at table.\n\n\"Brian Harper!\" exclaimed Mr. Dugdale, waking from a trance. \"Yes--Brian\nwould surely be able to furnish those statistics on Canadian wheat. His\njudgment was always as sound as his politics.\"\n\n\"What was your remark, Marmaduke\" said the old Squire, testily.\n\n\"O, nothing--nothing, father!\" Harrie quickly answered, with a half\nmerry, half warning frown at her lord. Mr. Dugdale folded himself up\nagain into silence, with the quiet consciousness of one who has a pearl\nin his keeping--the undoubted value of which there is no need either to\nput forward or to defend.\n\nMiss Valery here came to the rescue, and turned the conversation into\na merry channel Agatha was surprised to find what a wondrous power of\nunfeigned home-cheerfulness there was in this woman, who had lived to be\ncalled even by those that loved her, \"an old maid.\" And when at last the\nSquire gracefully allowed the departure of his women-kind, who floated\naway like a flock of released birds, they all clustered around Anne, as\nthough she were in the constant habit of knowing everybody's business,\nand of thinking and judging for everybody.\n\nAgatha sat a little way off, watching her, and wondering what could be\nthe strange influence which always made her take delight in watching\nAnne Valery.\n\nThere is something very peculiar in this admiration which one woman\noccasionally conceives for another, generally much older than herself.\nIt is not exactly friendship, but partakes more of the character of\nlove--in its idealisation, its shyness, its enthusiastic reverence, its\nhopeless doubt of requital, and, above all, its jealousies. For this\nreason, it generally comes previous to, or for want of, the real love,\nthe drawing of the feminine soul towards its masculine half, which\nmakes--according to the Platonic doctrine--a perfect being. Of\ncourse, this theory would be almost universally considered\n\"sentimentalism\"--Agatha's little infatuation being included therein;\nbut the frequency of such infatuations existing in the world around us\nargues some truth at their origin.\n\nTo the young girl--still so girlish, though she was married--there was\nan inexplicable attraction in all Anne Valery said or did. The very\nsweep of her dress across the floor--her slow soft motions, which might\nhave been haughty when she was young, but now were only gracious and\nself-possessed; the way she had of folding her hands on one another, and\nlooking straight forward with a kind observant smile, free alike from\nsentiment, crossness, or melancholy; her tone and manner, neither showy\nnor sharp; her habit of saying the wisest things in the most simple way,\nso that nobody recognised them as wisdom till afterwards--all filled\nAgatha with a sense of satisfied admiration. She wished either that she\nhad been a man, to have adored and married Anne years ago--or that her\nown marriage had been delayed for a little, until she had grown wiser\nand more fit for life's destiny by learning from and loving such a woman\nas Miss Valery.\n\nMoreover, with the dawning jealousy that all strong likings bring, she\nwished to appropriate her--and was quite annoyed that Anne sat so long\ndiscussing winter mantles with Eulalie and Mary, afterwards diverging\nto a Christmas clothing fund to be started at Kingcombe under Mrs.\nDugdale's eye; finally listening to a whispered communication on the\npart of the Beauty--which had reference to a certain \"Edward\"--about\nwhose position in the family there could be no mistake. At last, to\nAgatha's great satisfaction, Miss Valery rose, and proposed that they\ntwo--Mrs. Harper and herself--should go and visit Elizabeth.\n\nPassing through the galleries, Anne seemed tired, and walked slowly,\nstopping one minute at a window to show her companion the moonlight over\nthe hills.\n\n\"Is it not a beautiful world? If we could but look at it always as we\ndo when we are young!\" The half sigh, the momentary shadow sweeping over\nher quiet face like a cloud over the moon--surprised and touched Agatha.\n\n\"Do you know I have stood and looked out of this same window ever since\nI was the height of its first pane. No wonder I have a weakness for\nstopping here and looking out for a minute at my dear old moon. But let\nus pass on.\"\n\nShe took up her candle again, and led Agatha by the hand, like a\npet-child, to Elizabeth's door.\n\nMiss Harper was lying as usual, but had a writing-case before her, and\nit was astonishing what neat caligraphy those weak childish-looking\nfingers could execute. It resembled the writer's own mind--clear,\ndelicate, well-arranged, exact.\n\n\"We are not come to stay very long; but do we interrupt you, Elizabeth?\"\n\n\"Never, Anne, dear! I was only writing to Frederick. He is gone abroad,\nyou are aware?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I want to know why he went? Has Nathanael told either of you?\" said\nElizabeth, fixing her quick eyes on both her visitors.\n\nBoth answered in the negative--Miss Valery saying, with attempted\ngaiety, \"You know, one might as well question a stone wall as Nathanael.\nHe can be both deaf and dumb.\"\n\n\"Not to me. Everybody tells me everything, or I find it out. I found out\nthat this little lady had a chance of being my sister-in-law before ever\nshe herself was certain of the fact. Ah, Agatha, you should have seen\nNathanael when he came down to us that week.\"\n\n\"What did he do?\" the young wife asked, not without some painful\ncuriosity--for sometimes, in the moments when she could not \"make out\"\nher husband's rather peculiar character, a wicked demon had whispered\nthat perhaps Mr. Harper had never truly loved her, or that his devotion\nwas too sudden to be a lasting reality.\n\n\"What did he do?--Oh, nothing. He was very quiet, very self-possessed.\nYou could hardly tell he was in love at all. Nobody ever guessed it but\nI--not even Anne. But in love or not, I saw that he was determined to\nhave you; and when Nathanael determines on a thing--Oh, I knew you would\nbe married to him! You could not help it!\"\n\n\"Nor did she wish--nor need she,\" said Anne, gently, as she saw Agatha's\nconfusion. \"But we shall soon cease teasing our young couple. I hear\nthat at Christmas we shall have another marriage in the family. Edward\nThorpe has got the living--the richest one.\"\n\n\"So, of course, Eulalie will marry him.\" The deduction reached Agatha as\nrather sarcastic, though perhaps more through the interpretation of her\nown feeling than that of the speaker. She asked, with one of her usual\nplain speeches:\n\n\"Does Eulalie love Mr. Thorpe very much?\"\n\nThe remark was addressed to both; but after a pause Elizabeth said,\n\"Answer that question, Anne.\"\n\n\"What sort of an answer do you want, my dear?\"\n\n\"One perfectly plain. I like simplicity. Is Eulalie much attached to the\nman she is to marry?\"\n\n\"Women marry with many forms of love; Eulalie's will do exceedingly well\nfor Mr. Thorpe. He is a very worthy young clergyman, who takes a wife as\na matter of necessity. As for love--have you noticed, Agatha, how many\nwomen one sees, wives and mothers, who live creditably through a long\nlife, and go down to their graves without ever having known the real\nmeaning of the word?\"\n\nAnne was talking more than usual to-night, and Agatha liked to listen.\nThe subject came home to her. \"Will Eulalie be one of these?\"\n\n\"I think so. She may make a very good, attentive wife, but she will\nnever know what is real love.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what is that sort of love--the right love--which one ought to\nbring to one's husband?\"\n\nMiss Valery looked surprised at the young girl's eager manner. \"Are you\nseriously asking that question? and of me, who never had a husband?\"\n\n\"Oh, one likes to hear various opinions. What do you call 'loving?'\"\n\n\"Almost every human being loves in a different way.\"\n\n\"Well, then, your way I mean.\" But noticing the momentary reticence\nwhich Anne's manner showed, she added, \"I mean the kind of love you have\nmost sympathy with in other people.\"\n\n\"I have sympathy in all. My neighbours will tell you hereabouts that\nAnne Valery is the universal confidante, and the greatest marriage-maker\n(not match-maker) in all Dorset. I don't repudiate the character. It is\npleasant to see young people loving one another.\"\n\n\"Still, you have not told me what _you_ call loving.\"\n\n\"Do you really wish to hear?\" said Anne, seriously. Then speaking in a\nlow voice, she added: \"I would have every woman marry, not merely liking\na man well enough to accept him as a husband, but loving him so wholly,\nthat, wedded or not, she feels she is at heart his wife and none\nother's, to the end of her life. So faithful, that she can see all his\nlittle faults (though she takes care no one else shall see them), yet\nwould as soon think of loving him the less for these, as of ceasing to\nlook up to heaven because there are a few clouds in the sky. So true,\nand so fond, that she needs neither to vex him with her constancy, nor\nburden him with her love, since both are self-existent, and entirely\nindependent of anything he gives or takes away. Thus she will marry\nneither from liking, esteem, nor gratitude for his love, but from the\nfulness of her own. If they never marry, as sometimes happens\"--and\nAnne's voice slightly faltered--\"God will cause them to meet in the next\nexistence. They cannot be parted--they belong to one another.\"\n\nAll were silent--these three women--one to whom love must have been\nonly a name; the other who spoke of it quietly, seriously, as we talk\nof things belonging to the world to come; and the third, who sat\nthoughtful, wondering, doubting, afraid to believe in a truth which\nbrought with it her own condemnation.\n\n\"You talk, Miss Valery, as people do in books. Some would call it\nromance.\"\n\n\"Would they? And do you?\"\n\n\"Not quite. I used to think the same sometimes; but perfect love, like\nperfect beauty, is a thing one never meets with in real life.\"\n\n\"Yet one does not the less believe in it, and desire to find\napproximations thereto. No, my child, I do not talk romance, I am too\nold for that, and have seen too much of the world. Nevertheless, despite\nall I have seen--the false, foolish, weak attachments--the unholy\nmarriages--the after-life of marriage made unholier still by struggling\nagainst what was inevitable--still I believe in the one true love which\nbinds a woman's heart faithfully to one man in this life and, God grant\nit! in the next. But you have no need to hear all this--little wife? You\ndo not wish to be taught how to love Nathanael?\"\n\nAgatha tried to smile--to conceal the pain rising in her heart.\n\n\"Come then, I will teach you how to love him--in better words than\nmine, and from a woman who, though writing out of the deep truth of her\npoet-heart, would scorn to write mere 'romance.'\"\n\n\"Any woman would,\" answered Agatha, running her eyes over a book\nwhich Miss Valery had lifted from the silk coverlid, and which \"poor\nElizabeth\" looked after fondly, as sick people do after the face of a\nfriend.\n\n\"Listen, with your heart open. It is sure to find entrance there,\" said\nAnne, merrily, until, turning over the pages, she grew serious. She was\nnot quite too old to be insensible to the glamour of poetry. Her voice\nwas hardly like itself--at least, not like what Agatha had ever heard\nit--when she began to read:\n\n\"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth,\nand breadth, and height My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of Being and Ideal Grace. I love thee to the level of every\nday's Most quiet need; by sun and candle-light. I love thee freely, as\nmen strive for right: I love thee purely, as they turn from praise:\nI love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my\nchildhood's faith: I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost\nsaints; I love thee with the breath, Smiles, tears, of all my life! and,\nif God choose, I shall but love thee better after death.\"\n\nThere was a pause of full-hearted silence, and then Agatha heard a sigh\nbehind her.\n\nHer husband had come to the door, and, hearing reading, had stolen in,\nno one noticing him but his sister. Agatha saw nothing; her eyelids were\nclosely, fiercely shut, over the tears that rose at this vision of a\nlost or impossible paradise.\n\n\"Agatha!\" She looked up, and saw him stand, wearing his palest, coldest\naspect--that which always seemed to freeze up every young feeling within\nher. The pang it gave found vent in but one expression--scarcely meant\nto pass her lips--and inaudible to all save him:\n\n\"Oh, why--why did I marry!\"\n\nThe moment after, she felt how wrong it was, and would have atoned; but\nMr. Harper had moved quickly from her side. Elizabeth called him; he\nseemed not to hear; Anne, closing her book, addressed him:\n\n\"Are you come to talk with us, or to fetch your wife away?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" he said, bitterly. But recovering himself--\"Nay, Anne, I came\nfor you. My father wishes to see you. He will hear nothing I can urge.\nYou must come down and talk with him, or I do not know what will be\ndone.\"\n\nAgatha had until now forgotten that her husband had intended after\ndinner to tell his father his plans concerning the stewardship. It had\nbeen apparently a harder task than he thought, to strive with the old\nSquire's prejudices. Seeing his extreme perturbation, Agatha repented\nherself deeply of any unkindness towards him.\n\nShe went to his side. \"What is the matter? Tell me! Let me help you.\"\n\n\"You!\" he echoed; then added, with an accent studiously kind, \"Thank\nyou, Agatha. You are very good always.\"\n\nHe let her take his arm and stand talking with himself and Miss Valery.\n\n\"I feared it would be so,\" the latter said. \"Your father has a strong\nwill; still he can be persuaded. We must try.\"\n\n\"But only persuasion--no reasons. Understand me, Anne--no reasons!\"\n\nMiss Valery looked at the young man very earnestly.\n\n\"Nathanael, if I did not know you well, and know too whose guidance\nformed your character, it would be hard to trust you.\"\n\n\"Anne!\" Again the peculiar manner which sometimes appeared in him,\nmaking him seem much older than his years, had its strange influence\nwith Miss Valery, guiding her by an under-current deeper even than her\njudgment.\n\n\"Ay,\" she said in a whisper, \"I will trust you. Let us go down.\" And she\nturned with him to say good-bye to Miss Harper.\n\nThe excitement of talking had been too much for \"poor Elizabeth.\" One\nof her \"dark hours\" was upon her. The eyes were closed, and the face\nsharpened under keen physical pain. Agatha could hardly bear to see her;\nbut Nathanael bent over his sister with that soothing kindness which in\na man is so beautiful.\n\n\"Shall we stay with you? at least, shall I?\"\n\nElizabeth motioned a decided negative.\n\n\"I know,\" Miss Valery said, apart, \"she had rather be alone. No one can\ndo her good, and it is too much for this child, who is not used to it as\nwe are.\"\n\nCalling Elizabeth's maid from the inner room, Anne hurried Agatha away.\nShe, clinging to her husband's arm, heard him say, half to himself:\n\n\"And yet we think life hard, and murmur at that we have, and grieve for\nthat we have not! We are very wicked, all of us. Poor Elizabeth!\"\n\nThe three went very silently down-stairs.\n\nAt the dining-room door Mrs. Harper let go her husband's arm.\n\n\"Why are you leaving me, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Because I thought--I imagined, perhaps you wished\"--\n\n\"I wish to have you with me always. Anne knows,\" and he looked pointedly\nat Miss Valery, \"that I shall never respond to, and most certainly never\nvolunteer, any confidence to either her or my father that I do not share\nwith my wife. She has the first claim, and what is not hers no other\nperson shall obtain.\"\n\nAnne looked puzzled. At last she said, in an under tone, \"I think I\nunderstand, and you are quite right. I shall remember.\"\n\nThe old Squire was sitting in his arm-chair, the dessert and wine still\nbefore him. The cheerfulness of the dinner-circle over, he looked very\naged now--aged and lonely too, being the only occupant of that large\nroom. He raised his head when Miss Valery entered, but seemed annoyed at\nthe entrance of his daughter-in-law.\n\n\"Mrs. Harper! I did not mean to encroach on _your_ leisure.\"\n\n\"No, father; it was I who wished her to come. Forgive me, but I could\nnot bring Miss Valery into our family councils and exclude my own wife.\nShe is not a stranger now.\"\n\nSaying this, Nathanael placed Agatha in a chair and stood beside her,\ntaking her cold hand, for with all her power she could not keep herself\nfrom trembling. She had never known anything of those formidable affairs\nwhich are called \"family quarrels.\"\n\n\"Now, father,\" he continued in a straightforward but respectful manner,\n\"Anne will answer any question to prove what I have already told\nyou--that it is at my own request she takes me for her steward.\"\n\n\"Her friend and adviser,\" Anne interposed.\n\n\"I never doubted, Nathanael, that it was at your own request. Otherwise\nit were impossible that Miss Valery would so far have insulted my\nfamily.\"\n\nAt these words Anne coloured, and moved a step or two with something of\nthe pride of her young days. \"I did not think, Mr. Harper, that it\nwould have been either an insult to offer, or a disgrace to accept, the\nposition which your son desires to hold. Far be it from me in any way to\nwrong any member of your family, especially the son whom your wife left\nin my arms--and Brian's--when she died.\"\n\nAgatha had never before heard Miss Valery say \"Brian.\" She was evidently\nspeaking as people do when much moved, using a form of phrase and\nalluding to things not commonly referred to.\n\nThe old Squire sat silent a minute, and then stretched out his hand. \"I\nknow your goodness, Anne! But I cannot renounce all my rights. Even a\nyounger son must not throw discredit on his family. Except in one brief\ninstance, for centuries there has never been a Harper who worked for his\nliving.\"\n\n\"Then, father, let me be the first to commence that act of inconceivable\nboldness and energy,\" said Nathanael, with a good-humoured persuasive\nsmile. \"Let me, being likewise a younger son, take a leaf out of Uncle\nBrian's book, and try to labour, as he once did, in my own county, with\nthe honour of my own race about me.\"\n\n\"And what did he effect? Was he not looked down upon, humiliated,\ncheated? I never ride past his old deserted clay-pits without being\nthankful that he went to Canada, rather than have disgraced us by what\nhis folly must have come to at last. He would have lost the little he\nhad--have been bankrupt, perhaps dishonoured.\"\n\n\"Mr. Harper!\"--Anne rose from her chair--\"I think you speak rather\nhardly of your brother. It never could be said, or will be said, that\nBrian Harper was _dishonoured._\"\n\nAt these words, spoken with unusual warmth, Nathanael gratefully clasped\nher hand. The Squire observed, with added dignity, that no one could be\nmore sensible than himself of his brother's merit, and that he thanked\nMiss Valery for extending her kind interests to every branch of the\nHarper family.\n\n\"And now,\" he continued, \"we will cease this conversation. My son\nknows my sentiments, and will doubtless act upon them. I never maintain\narguments with my children.\" And the sentence implied that what \"I never\ndo,\" was consequently a thing unnecessary and impossible to be done. The\nold gentleman leant on each arm of his chair, and feebly tried to rise.\n\n\"Father,\" cried Nathanael, detaining him, \"I would do much rather than\ntry you thus; but it cannot be helped. I must work.\"\n\n\"I do not see the necessity.\"\n\n\"But if there be a necessity; if my own feelings, my conscience--other\nreasons, which here I cannot urge\"--and involuntarily his eye glanced\ntowards his wife.\n\nAn instinct of delicacy brightened the old man's perceptions. He bowed\nto Agatha. \"We need not apologise for these discussions before a lady\nwho has done my son the honour of uniting her fortune to his ancient\nfamily.\" (And he evidently thought the honour bestowed was quite as\nmuch on the Harper side.) \"She, I am sure, will agree with me that this\nproceeding is not necessary.\"\n\nAgatha hesitated. Much as she longed to do it, a sense of right\nprevented her from openly siding against her husband. She kept silence;\nNathanael answered with the tone of one who sets a strong guard upon his\nlips, almost stronger than he can bear:\n\n\"I have already told my wife all the reasons I have just given you,\nthat, since I am resolved to be independent, there is no way but this. I\nhave been brought up abroad, and have learnt no profession; my health is\nnot robust enough for a town life, or for hard study. Many, almost all\nthe usual modes in which a man, born a gentleman, can earn his living\nare thus shut out from me. What Anne Valery offers me I _can_ do,\nand should be content in doing. Father, do not stand in the way of my\nwinning for myself a little comfort--a little peace.\"\n\nThrough his entreaty, earnest and manly as it was, there ran a sort of\nmelancholy which surprised and grieved Agatha. Could this be the lover\non whom, in giving him herself, she believed she had bestowed entire\nfelicity? Had he too, like herself, found a something wanting in\nmarriage, a something to fill up which he must needs resort to an active\ncareer of worldly toil? Would she never be able to make either him or\nherself truly happy? and if so, what was the cause?\n\nThe Squire keenly regarded his son, who stood before him in an attitude\nso respectful yet so firm. Something seemed to strike him in the pale,\ndelicate, womanish features; perhaps he saw therein the wife who had\ndied when Nathanael was born, and whose death, people said, had chilled\nthe father's heart strangely against the poor babe.\n\n\"My son,\" he said, \"you have been away from me nearly all your life--and\nwhere I have given little, I can require little. But I am an old man.\nDo not let me feel that you too are setting yourself against my grey\nhairs.\"\n\n\"God knows, father, I would not for worlds! But what can I do? Anne,\nwhat can I do?\"\n\nAnne rose, and leant over Mr. Harper's chair, like a privileged eldest\ndaughter who secretly strengthened with her judgment the wisdom that\nwas growing feeble through old age; doing it reverently, as we all would\nwish our children to do when our own light grows dim. For, alas! the\nwisest and firmest of us may come one day to mutter in the ears of\na younger generation the senile cry, \"I am old and foolish--old and\nfoolish.\"\n\n\"Dear friend--if Nathanael follows out this plan, it will be for the\ncomfort and not the disquiet of your grey hairs. Think how pleasant\nalways to have a son at hand, and a young, pretty Mrs. Harper to\nbrighten Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\nThis was a wise thrust--the old gentleman looked in his\ndaughter-in-law's fair face, and bowed complacently.\n\n\"Then, too, your son will live in the country, lead the life that he\nloves, and that you love--the very life which all these years you have\nbeen vainly planning for his brother.\"\n\nThe Squire turned sharply round. \"On that subject, if you please, we\nwill be silent. Anne, Anne,\" he added, \"do you want again to turn my\nplans aside? Would you take from me my other son also?\"\n\nShe drew back, much wounded.\n\n\"No, no, my dear, I did not mean that. It was not your fault--you\ntwo were not suited for each other. Nevertheless, in spite of your\nwilfulness, in nothing but the name did I lose a daughter. Forgive me,\nAnne!\"\n\n\"My dear old friend,\" she whispered, and stole her fingers into the\nwithered palm of the Squire. He kissed them with the grace of an old\ncourtier: the tenderness of a father. She, though moved at his kindness,\nbetrayed no stronger emotion; and Agatha, who had watched intently\nthis little episode, confirmatory of an old suspicion of her own, was\nconsiderably puzzled thereby. If Anne Valery's life contained any sad\nsecret, it was evidently not this. She had not remained an old maid for\nlove of Major Harper.\n\n\"Nathanael,\" said the old man, returning with dignity to the former\nconversation, \"I would not be harsh or unjust. There is but one way to\nreconcile our opposing wills, since you are determined on this scheme of\nindependence. You have told me your plan--will you accept mine?\"\n\n\"Let me hear it, father,\" answered Nathanael respectfully.\n\n\"You have hitherto had nothing from me--your Uncle Brian insisted on\nthat--nor will you ever have much; I must keep my property intact for\nthe next heir of Kingcombe Holm. Nothing shall alienate the rights of\nmy eldest son, with whom rests the honour of our family and name.\"\n\nAgatha noticing the determined pride with which her father-in-law said\nthis, wondered that her husband listened with a lowered aspect and made\nno response. She thought it unbrotherly, unkind.\n\n\"But,\" continued Mr. Harper, \"though the chief of all I possess must\nremain secure for Frederick, I have a little besides, saved for my\ndaughters' portions. If, with their consent, I lend you this, and you\nwill embark in some profession\"--\n\n\"No, father, no! I will never take one farthing from you or my sisters!\nI will not again be burdened with other people's property! Oh for the\ndays when I earned my own solitary bread from hand to mouth, and was\nfree and at rest!\"\n\nHe spoke excitedly, and was only conscious of the extent of what he had\nsaid by feeling his wife's hand drop slowly from his own.\n\n\"Nay, Agatha, I did not mean\"--and he tried to draw it back again.\n\"Forgive me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we have both need to forgive one another.\"\n\nNo one heard this mournful whisper between the young husband and wife;\nthey stood as if it had not been uttered--for both their consciences\nfelt duty to be a bond as strong as love.\n\nAnd then, on the painful silence which sank over all four, smote ten\nheavy strokes of the hall-clock, warning the swift passage of time--too\nswift to be wasted in struggle, regret, and contention. Anne rose, her\npale face seeming to have that very thought written thereon.\n\n\"My dear friends, listen to me a minute. Here is one who all this time\nhas not spoken a word, and yet the question concerns her more than any\nof us. Let Agatha decide.\"\n\nThe old man hesitated. Perhaps in his heart he was desirous of a\ncompromise. Or else he judged from ordinary human nature, that the pride\nof the young wife would ally her on his side, and so win over a will\nwhich any father looking into Nathanael's face could see was not to be\nthreatened into concession.\n\n\"_Pas aux dames,_\" said Mr. Harper, with a pleasantly chivalric air.\nThen more seriously: \"My daughter-in-law, choose. But remember that you\nstand between your husband and his father.\"\n\nAgatha, thrust into so new and important a position, felt a rush of\ntemptations to follow her own impulse. She turned appealingly to Miss\nValery, but Anne's eyes were fixed on the floor. She looked at her\nhusband, and met a gaze of doubt, anxiety, mingled with a certain\ndesperation.\n\n\"He knows my feeling about this matter; perhaps he thinks me a wilful\nchild, ready to take advantage of the liberty given me. He is sure of\nwhat I shall say.\"\n\nAnd she had half a mind to say it, as a condemnation for his so unkindly\njudging her; but the girlish pettishness and recklessness went away, and\na better spirit came. She sat, her right hand nervously pushing backward\nand forward the still unfamiliar wedding-ring, until in accidentally\nfeeling the symbol, she suddenly remembered the reality.\n\n\"I am a wife,\" she thought. \"Under _all_ circumstances I will do a\nwife's duty.\" And with that determination all the pleasant little\nfollies and temptations buzzing round her heart flew away, and left\nher--as one always is, having resolved to consider the right and nothing\nelse--resolute and at ease.\n\nShe said very simply--almost childishly--taking her father-in-law's hand\nthe while, \"If you please, and if you would not be angry, I would rather\ndo exactly as my husband likes. He knows best.\"\n\nIn these words she had exhausted all her boldness; and for a few minutes\nafter had a very indistinct notion of everything, save that the Squire\nhad walked off, not angrily, but in perfect silence, leaning on Miss\nValery's arm, and that she was left in the dining-room alone with\nNathanael.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\"So here is the result of family dinner-parties, and family-talks kept\nup till midnight!\" said Mary Harper, with a little natural acerbity.\n\"It is provoking for the mistress of a precise household to sit waiting\nbreakfast for a whole hour.\"\n\n\"Mary, be charitable! We did not know you were ready, and we were so\nbusy in my room. No laziness, was it, Agatha?\"\n\n\"No, indeed: I think Miss Valery is the very busiest woman I ever knew.\nHow can she get through it all?\"\n\n\"Only by first making up my mind, and then acting upon it. Your\nhusband's plan, too, I see. He and I shall get on as if we had worked\ntogether all our lives. Shall we not, my 'right-hand' Nathanael?\"\n\nHe answered pleasantly; he looked quite a new man this morning. \"Yes: I\nseem to understand your ways already. My first half-hour's business in\nthe memorable 'Anne's room' at Kingcombe Holm has been like a return of\nold times. What a woman you are! You might have been brought up as I was\nby Uncle Brian. You have just his ways.\"\n\nAnne smiled: and with a jest about the treble compliment he had\ncontrived to pay, let the conversation slip past to other things.\n\nMary and Eulalie talked excessively. They were both much scandalised by\ntheir brother's new position and intended course of life, to be put in\npractice immediately.\n\nBoth the Miss Harpers were that sort of feminine minds which are like\nsome kinds of flower-bells--the less fair the wider they open. Agatha\nwondered to see how very patient Miss Valery was over Mary's mild\nplatitudes and Eulalie's follies. But Anne's good heart seemed to cast\na shield of tenderness over everybody that bore the name of Harper. At\nlength the young wife got tired of the after-breakfast discussion, which\nconsisted of about a dozen different plans for the day--severally put\nup and knocked down again--each contradicting the other. The mild\n_laissez-faire_ of country life in a large family was quite too much for\nher patience; she longed to get up and shake everybody into common-sense\nand decision. But her husband and Miss Valery took everything\neasily--they were used to the ways at Kingcombe Holm.\n\n\"Oh, if your sister Harriet would but come in, or Mr. Dugdale!\" she\nwhispered to her husband, \"surely they would settle something.\"\n\n\"Not at all; they would only make matters worse. And, look!--'speaking\nof angels, one often sees their wings.'--Is that you, Marmaduke?\"\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\nMr. Dugdale walked in composedly through the sash-window, beaming around\nhim a sort of general smile. He never attempted any individual greeting,\nand Agatha offering her hand, was met by his surprised but benevolent\n\"Eh!\" However, when required, he gave her a hearty grasp. After which,\npeering dreamily round the room, he pounced upon a queer-looking folio,\nand buried himself therein, making occasional remarks highly interesting\nof their kind, but slightly irrelevant to the conversation in general.\nAgatha amused herself with peeping at the title of the book--some\nabstruse work on mechanical science--and then watched the reader,\nthinking what great intellectual power there was in the head, and what\nacuteness in the eye. Also, he wore at times a wonderfully spiritual\nexpression, strangely contrasting with the materiality of his daily\nexistence. No one could see that look without feeling convinced that\nthere were beautiful depths open only to Divinest vision, in the silent\nand abstracted nature of Marmaduke Dugdale. Nevertheless, he could be\neminently practical now and then, especially in mechanics.\n\n\"Nathanael, Nathanael! just look here. This is the very contrivance that\nwould have suited Brian in his old clay-pits. See!\"\n\nAnd he began talking in a style that was Greek itself to Agatha, but to\nwhich Nathanael, leaning over his chair-back, listened intelligently.\nIt was very nice to see the liking between the two brothers-in-law--the\nyoung man so tender over the oddities of the elder one, who seemed such\na strange mixture of the philosopher and the child. These were the sort\nof traits which continually turned Agatha's heart towards her husband.\n\n\"Talking of clay-pits,\" said Duke, with a gleam of recollection, \"I've\nsomething for you here!\" He drew out of the voluminous mass of papers\nthat stuffed his pockets one more carelessly scrawled than the rest.\n\"It's a plan of my own, for giving a little help to our own clay-cutters\nand to the stone-cutters in the Isle of Portland, who are shockingly off\nin the winter sometimes. Here's Trenchard's name down for a good sum--it\nwill make him and Free-trade popular, you know.\"\n\nAnd Mr. Dugdale smiled with the most amiable and innocent\nMachiavellianism.\n\nNathanael shook his head mischievously, greatly to the amusement of his\nwife, who had stolen up to see what was going on, and stood hanging on\nhis arm and peeping over at the illegible paper.\n\n\"Excellent plan, Marmaduke--very long-headed. You give them Christmas\ndinners, and they give you--votes.\"\n\n\"Bless you, no! That would be bribery. We\"--he reflected a minute--\"Oh,\nwe will only help those who have got no votes.\"\n\n\"Then the voters will all be against you.\"\n\nMr. Dugdale, much puzzled, pushed up his hair until it stood right aloft\non his forehead. Soon a dawn of satisfaction reappeared. \"All against\nus? Dear me, no! They would be pleased to see their poor neighbours\nhelped on in the world, as you or I would, you know. They'd side at once\nwith Trenchard and Free-trade. Come now, Nathanael, you'll assist? By\nthe way, somebody told me you were very rich--or at least that your wife\nwas an heiress. She looks a kind little soul She'll put her name down\nunder Anne Valery's here?\"\n\nAnd he turned to Agatha with that air of frank goodness by which\nMarmaduke Dugdale could coax everybody round to his own ends.\n\n\"Ay, that we will, though I suppose I am not so rich as Miss Valery.\nStill, we have enough to help poor people--have we not?\"\n\nShe appealed gaily to Mr. Harper, but he replied nothing. She persisted:\n\n\"We need not give much, since Mr. Trenchard and Miss Valery are both on\nthe list before us. We'll give--let me see--fifty pounds. Ah, now,\njust go up-stairs and fetch me down fifty pounds!\" said she, hanging\ncaressingly on her husband's arm.\n\nHe looked down on her, and looked away. He had become very grave. \"We\nwill talk of this some other time, dear.\"\n\n\"But another time will not do. I want it now. I fear,\" she whispered,\nblushing--\"I fear, before I married, I was very thoughtless and selfish.\nI would like to cure myself, and spend my money usefully, as Anne Valery\ndoes. Charity is such a luxury.\"\n\n\"Too dear a luxury for every one,\" said Nathanael sighing.\n\nShe looked up, scarcely believing him to be in earnest. Her\nopen-hearted, open-handed nature was much hurt. She said, with a bitter\nmeaning:\n\n\"I did not know I had such a very prudent husband.\"\n\nHe took no notice, but addressed himself to Mr. Dugdale. \"Nay, Duke, you\nand your benevolences are too hard upon us young married people. We must\ntighten our purse-strings against you this time.\"\n\nAgatha's cheek flamed. \"But if _I_ wish it\"--\n\n\"Dear, it cannot be, we cannot afford it.\"\n\nAgatha moved angrily from his side, and soon after, though not so soon\nas to attract notice to him or herself, she quitted the room. Scarcely\nhad she reached her own when she heard a step behind her.\n\n\"Are you angry with me, my wife, and for such a little thing?\"\n\nNathanael stood there, holding both her hands, and looking down upon her\nwith a face so kind, so regretful, so grave, that she felt ashamed of\nthe quick storm which had ruffled her own spirit The cause of this did\nseem now a very \"little thing.\" She hung her head, child-like, and made\nno answer.\n\n\"Why is it,\" said Mr. Harper, putting his arm round her--\"why is it that\nwe are always having these 'little things' rising up to trouble us?\nWhy cannot we bear with one another, and take the chance-happiness that\nfalls to our lot? It is not much, I fear\"--\n\nShe looked uneasy.\n\n\"Nay, perhaps that is chiefly my fault. I often wish Heaven had given\nyou a better husband, Agatha.\"\n\nAnd his countenance was so softened, mournful, and tender, that Agatha's\naffection returned. There was something childish and foolish in these\nsmall wranglings. They wore her patience away. For the twentieth time\nshe vowed not to make herself unhappy, or restless, or cross, but to\ntake Nathanael's goodness as she saw it, believing in it and him. Since\naccording to that wise speech of Harriet--which even Anne Valery smiled\nat and did not deny--the best of men were very disagreeable at times,\nand no man's good qualities ever came out thoroughly until he had been\nmarried for at least a year.\n\nWith a tear in her eye and a quiver on her lip, Agatha held up her young\nface to her husband. He kissed her, and there was peace.\n\nBut though he had made this concession, and made many others in the\ncourse of the next hour, to remove from her mind every thought of pain,\nstill he showed not the slightest change of will regarding the cause of\ndispute. And perhaps in her secret heart this only caused his wife to\nrespect him the more. It is usually the weak and erring who vacillate.\nFirmness of purpose, mildly carried out, implies a true motive at the\nroot. Agatha began to think whether her husband might not have some\nreason for his conduct; probably the very simple one of disliking to see\nhis name or her own paraded in a subscription-list, or mixed up with a\npolitical clique.\n\nNevertheless, he puzzled her. She could not think why, with all his\ntenderness, he so often put his will in opposition to her own, and\nprevented her pleasure; why he was so slow in giving her his confidence;\nwhy he more than once plainly stated that there was \"a reason\" for\nvarious disagreeable whims, yet had not told her what that reason was.\nAll these were trivial things--yet in the early sunrise of married life\nthe least molehill throws a long black shadow.\n\n\"I will be a wise woman. I will not disquiet myself in vain,\" said the\nlittle wife to herself, as her husband left her, in answer to repeated\ncalls from some feminine voice which had just entered the house, and\nwas immediately audible half over it. Harriet Dugdale's, of course. To\nher--sharp-sighted and merry-tongued woman that she was--Agatha would\nnot for worlds have betrayed anything; so, dashing cold water on her\nforehead to hide the very near approach to tears, she quickly descended.\n\nHarrie was in a state of considerable indignation, mixed with laughter.\n\"I never knew such people as you are! and certainly never was there the\nlike of my Duke there. He set off to fetch you all to Corfe Castle--his\nown proposition. I waited an hour and a half--then I took the pony to\nsee after you--and lo!--there he is, sitting quite at his ease. Oh,\nDuke--Duke!\"\n\nShe shook her riding-whip at him twice before she disturbed him from his\nbook.\n\n\"Eh, Missus--what do'ee want, my child?\"\n\n\"Want? Don't you see what a passion we're all in? Abuse him,\nAnne--Agatha--Nathanael! Do! I've no patience with him. Didn't he say\nhimself that he would take us all to Corfe Castle? Oh, you--you\"---- And\nHarrie looked unutterable things.\n\nMr. Dugdale gazed round placidly. \"Really, now, that's a pity! Never\nmind, Missus! I only forgot.\" And patting her hand with ineffable\ngentleness and good-humour, he opened his book again.\n\n\"Oh, you--you\"--here she put on a melodramatic scowl--\"you inconceivably\nprovoking, misty, oblivious, incomprehensible old darling!\"\n\nAnd springing upon the back of his chair, Harrie hugged him to a degree\nthat compelled the unfortunate philosopher to renounce his book. He took\nthe caresses very patiently, and smiled with superior love upon his\nmerry wife.\n\n\"That'll do, Missus! Eh--and before folk, too! Now don't'ee, my child!\"\n\nAnd shaking himself, hair and all, into something like order, he picked\nup the folio, tucked it under his arm, and wended his way through the\nwindow slowly down the lawn.\n\nAgatha glanced at her husband, who stood talking to Miss Valery. She\nwondered what Nathanael would say if _she_ were to take a leaf out of\nhis sister's book, and treat her own liege lord after the unceremonious\nfashion of Harrie Dugdale!\n\n\"There--off he goes, quite cross, no doubt.\" (He was smiling as\nbenevolently as if he could embrace the whole world.) \"But we must catch\nhim at the stables. I brought White-star galloping after me, and Duke\nwill rouse up when he sees his beloved horse. You shall take my pony,\nAgatha. Of course you can ride?\"\n\nAgatha could--in a London riding-school and London parks. She had her\ndoubts about the country, but felt strongly inclined to try; for Mrs.\nDugdale had entered Kingcombe Holm like a breath of keen fresh air,\nputting life and spirit into everybody. Nathanael made no opposition,\nonly he insisted on Mary's quiet grey mare being substituted for\nHarrie's skittish pony.\n\n\"I shall ride with you part way,\" said he, \"and then leave you in Mr.\nDugdale's charge, while I stay at Kingcombe.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"I have business there.\"\n\nStill the same weary \"business\" which he never explained or talked\nabout, yet which always seemed to rise up like a bugbear on their\npleasures, until Agatha was sick of the sound of the word!\n\nShe turned away, and put herself altogether under Mrs. Dugdale's care to\nbe equipped for the ride.\n\nAnne Valery, coming in with her quiet common sense, succeeded in making\nup the party, which, with one exception, Harrie had left to make itself\nup according to its own discretion. When Mrs. Harper descended, she\nfound all settled for the spending of a day at Corfe Castle, in picnic\nstyle--glorious and free--with a moonlight canter home in the evening.\nNo one was omitted except the Squire, who with considerable dignity\ndeclined such _al fresco_ amusements; and Anne Valery, who promised to\npeep in upon them as she passed the Castle on her way to her own house,\nafter spending a few hours with Elizabeth.\n\nAgatha had never been on horseback since she was married. It made her\nfeel like a girl again, and brought back all the wild spirits of her\nyouth, now repressed in propriety by her changed life--until sometimes\nshe hardly knew herself, or fancied she was growing into that object of\nher former scorn, an ordinary young lady. She cast the subdued and meek\n\"Mrs. Locke Harper\" to the winds, and dashed wildly back for this day at\nleast into \"Agatha Bowen.\"\n\nHer husband, putting her on her horse, with many injunctions, was\nsurprised to see her give him a careless nod and dart off delightedly,\nas if she and the grey mare had wings. The Dugdales followed, a wild\npair, for Marmaduke was quite another being on horseback.\n\n\"Look at him, Agatha,\"--and Harrie's laugh ringing on the wind caused\nthe mild grey mare to seem rather restless in her mind. \"Did you think\nmy Duke could ride as he does? He never looks so well as on horseback.\nHe is a perfect Thessalian!\"\n\nAgatha was amused to find classic lore in Harrie Dugdale, and she gave\nmost cordial admiration to Duke. \"He is a magnificent rider; he sits the\nhorse just as if he were born to it.\"\n\n\"Bless him! so he was. He rode his father's horses at four years old,\nand went hunting at fourteen. And he has such a beautiful temper, and\nsuch a firm will besides--that he could manage the wildest brute in the\ncounty. See there!\"\n\nWhite-star had become rather obstreperous, showing his spirit; his\nmaster carelessly lent down, giving him a box on each ear, just as if\nthe stately blood horse had been a naughty child; then composedly rode\nhim back to the two ladies.\n\n\"Harrie! Missus! do'ee come on! Nathanael is behind, all right. Come\nalong!\"\n\nHe gave his wife's pony a switch, and off they dashed, she laughing\nmerrily, and he galloping away with such ease and grace that Agatha\ncould not take her eyes off him.\n\nShe looked after them with a vague sense of envy,--this odd married\npair, in whose union so many things appeared unequal and peculiar,\nexcept for one thing--the love which hallowed and perfected all. When\nher own husband came up, she, unwilling to talk, and dreading above all\nthat his quick eye should detect anything amiss in her, pushed her horse\nforward, and calling to Nathanael to follow, rode on after the Dugdales.\n\nEre they had ridden far, all her wild spirits came back again, and all\nher wifely feelings too, for her husband seemed as happy as herself, and\nentered into all her frolics. They swept along like two children, across\nthe breezy moors, purple and fragrant, down by the hilly sheep-paths,\nlying bare in autumn sunshine. Nathanael proved himself almost as good a\nhorseman as Duke Dugdale: a great pleasure to Agatha, for of all things\nwomen do like a man to be manly. Nay, once, in the descent of a hill so\nsteep, that a Cockney equestrian would have been frightened out of his\nseven senses, Nathanael's prudent daring stood out in such bold relief\nthat Agatha was perforce reminded of the day when he snatched little\nJemmie from the bear, the first day when her liking and respect had been\nawakened towards him. She hinted this, and said how pleasant it was to\nfeel that one's husband was, as she expressed it, \"a man that could take\ncare of one.\"\n\n\"And how very foolish and helpless townfolk--drawing-room gentlemen,\nappear in the country! I wonder,\" and she could not help telling him the\ncomical idea, though not very complimentary to her husband's brother--\"I\nwonder how Major Harper would look on horseback?\"\n\n\"What did you say? The wind blew that sentence away.\"\n\nShe hardly liked to repeat it exactly, but said something about Major\nHarper and his coming down to Dorset.\n\nNathanael spurred his horse forward without replying. A minute\nafterwards he returned to his wife's side, bringing her a great bunch of\nheather, with yellow gorse mixed, and made jokes about the Dorsetshire\nsaying, \"When gorse is out of bloom kissing's out of season.\" And\nevermore he looked secretly at her, to notice if she laughed and was\nhappy, had roses on her cheeks, and pleasure in her eyes. Seeing this,\nthe husband appeared contented and at ease.\n\nThey and the Dugdales rode merrily into Kingcombe, much to that good\ntown's astonishment. The equestrian quartette at Marmaduke's door was\na sight that the worthy inhabitants of that sleepy street would not get\nover for a week. Everybody gathered at doors and windows, and a small\ngroup of farmers at the market quadrangle stared with all their eyes.\nThe sensation created was enormous, and likewise the crowd,--almost as\ndense as a wandering juggler gathers in a quiet suburban London street!\nAgatha, passing through it, laughed till she could laugh no longer.\n\nHer husband, pleased at her gaiety, came to lift her off her horse.\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" Mrs. Dugdale cried. \"Keep your seat, Agatha; no time\nto lose; on we go in a minute, when Duke has been to get his letters.\nHere, Brian, my pet.\"--There had rushed out round her horse a cluster of\ninfantine Dugdales.--\"Lift Brian up here, Uncle Nathanael, and I'll give\nhim a canter. Bravo! He's Pa's own boy, born for a rider! Come along,\nAuntie Agatha.\"\n\nAgatha would willingly have followed down the street. She was amused by\nthe daring of the mother and the boy, and amused especially by her new\ntitle of \"Auntie Agatha.\"\n\n\"Do let me go, Mr. Harper; I don't want to dismount, indeed.\"\n\n\"But I have something to say to you--just a few words. We must decide\nto-day about the house, you know.\"\n\n\"Never mind the house; I had rather not think about it.\" And the mere\nshadow of past vexation still vexed her. \"Ah!\" she added, entreatingly,\n\"do be good to me--do let me enjoy myself for once!\"\n\n\"I would not prevent you for the world.\" He dropped her bridle with a\nsigh, and turned back among his little nephews.\n\nFred had coaxed the horse from the groom, and Gus was bent on mounting;\nthere was a dreadful struggle, and angry cries for Uncle Nathanael. In\nthe midst of it Uncle Nathanael appeared, like an angel of peace, and\nsetting the boys one behind another on his horse's back, led the animal\nup and down carefully.\n\nAgatha looked after them, thinking how kind and good her husband was.\nShe wished she had not refused so hastily such a simple request; she\nbegan to think herself a wretch for ever contradicting him in anything.\n\nThe little party started again, increased by the arrival of the family\ncarriage from Kingcombe Holm, wherein sat Mary and Eulalie. To these\nwere speedily added the three young Dugdales, all in high glee. And it\nspoke well for the Miss Harpers, whom Agatha was disposed to like least\nof her husband's relatives, that they made very lenient and kindly aunts\nto those obstreperous boys.\n\nAgatha was crossing the bridge which bounded South Street, trying to\nmake her horse stand still while Mr. Dugdale pointed out the identical\nred cliff where the Danes drew up their ships, and laughing with Harrie\nat the notion of how terribly frightened the quiet souls in Kingcombe\nwould be at such an incursion now, when Nathanael came on foot to his\nwife's side.\n\n\"Why did you start without speaking to me?\"\n\n\"I could not help it; I thought you were gone. You will come after us\nsoon?\" And she felt angry with herself for having momentarily forgotten\nhim.\n\n\"I will come when I have settled this business of the house. You\nunderstand, Agatha, I am obliged to decide to-day? You will not blame\nme afterwards?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--no!\" His extreme seriousness of manner jarred with her youthful\nspirits. She did not think or care about what he did, so that for this\nday only he let her be gay and happy. From some incomprehensible cause,\nhis very love seemed to hang over her like a cloud, and so it had been\nfrom the beginning. She did so long to dash out into the sunshine of\nher careless, girlish life, and scamper over the beautiful country with\nHarrie Dugdale.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she repeated only wishing to satisfy him. \"Take any house you\nlike, and come onward soon; and oh, do let us be cheerful and merry!\"\n\n\"We will!\" His bright look as she patted his shoulder--a very\nventuresome act---gave her much cheer; and when, after she had cantered\na good way down the road, she turned and saw him still leaning on the\nbridge looking after her, her heart throbbed with pleasure. Despite all\nhis reserves and peculiarities, and her own conscious failings, there\nwas one thing to which she clung as to a root of comfort that\nwould never be taken away, and would surely bear blossom and fruit\nafterwards--the belief that her husband truly loved her.\n\n[Illustration: On horseback  p212]\n\n\"If so,\" she thought, \"I suppose all will come right in time, and Agatha\nHarper will be as happy as, or happier than, Agatha Bowen.\"\n\nSo on she went, yielding to the delicious excitement of being on\nhorseback. She was also much interested by the country round about,\nwhich appeared to her as old, desolate, and strange as if she had been\na Thane's daughter riding across the moors to the gates of that renowned\ncastle which, as Harrie declared, putting on the physiognomy of some\nschool-child drawling out a history-lesson, \"was celebrated for being\nthe residence of the ancient Saxon kings.\"\n\n\"And this was the place,\" continued she in the same tone, pointing to an\nold gate-post--\"this was the place where His Majesty's most illustrious\nhorse did stop when His Majesty's most sainted body was dragged along by\nthe leg, in the stirrup, on account of the wound given him when he was\na-drinking at the castle-door, by his stepmother, Queen Elfrida. All of\nwhich is to be seen to the present day.\"\n\nAgatha first laughed at this comical view of the subject, then she\nfelt a little repugnance at hearing that stern old tragedy so lightly\ntreated. As she walked her horse along the road which might have been,\nand probably was, the very same Saxon highway as in those times, she\nthought of the wounded horseman dashing out from between those green\nhills and of the murdered body dropping slowly, slowly from the saddle,\ndragged in dust, and beat against stones, until the woman that loved\nhim--for even a king might have had some woman that loved him--would not\nhave known the face she thought so fair.\n\nIt was an idle fancy, but beneath it her tears were rising; chiefly\nfor thinking, not of \"The Martyr,\" but of the woman--whoever she\nwas--(Agatha had not historical erudition enough to remember if King\nEdward had a wife)--to whom that day's tragedy might have brought\na lifetime's doom. She began to shudder--to feel that she too was a\nwife--to understand dimly what a wife's love might come to be--also\nsomething of a wife's terrors. She wished--it was foolish enough, but\nshe did wish that Nathanael had not been riding on horseback, or else\nthat, in picturing to herself the dead head of the Martyr dragged along\nthe road, she did not always see it with long fair hair. And then she\nwondered if these horrible fancies indicated the dawning of that feeling\nwhich she had deceived herself into believing she already possessed. Was\nshe beginning to find out the difference between that quiet response\nto secured affection, that pleasant knowledge of being loved, and\nthe strong, engrossing, self-existent attachment which Anne Valery\ndescribed--the passion which has but one object, one interest, one joy,\nin the whole wide world?\n\nWas she beginning really _to love_ her husband?\n\nThe answer to that question involved so much, both of what had been, and\nwhat was yet to come, that Agatha dared not ponder over it.\n\n\"Mrs. Harper! Mrs. Harper!\" She mused no longer, but hurried on after\nthe Dugdales.\n\nIt was not to point out the Castle that Harrie had been so vociferous,\nbut to show a place which she evidently deemed far more interesting.\n\n\"Do you see that white house far among the trees? That's where my Duke\nwas born. He lived there in peace and quietness till he got acquainted\nwith Uncle Brian, and came to Kingcombe Holm and fell in love with me.\"\n\n\"How did he do it? I want to know what is the fashion of such things in\nDorset.\"\n\n\"How did Duke fall in love with me? Really I can't tell. I was fifteen\nor so--a mere baby! He first gave me a doll, and then he wanted to marry\nme!\"\n\n\"But how did he make love, or 'propose' as they call it?\" persisted\nAgatha, to whom the idea of Marmaduke Dugdale in that character was\nirresistibly funny.\n\n\"Make love? Propose? Bless you, my dear, he never did either! Somehow it\nall came quite naturally. We belonged to one another.\"\n\nThe very phrase Anne Valery had used! It made Nathanael's wife rather\nthoughtful. She wondered what was the feeling like, when people\n\"belonged to one another.\"\n\nBut she had no time for meditation; for now the great grey ruin loomed\nin sight, and everybody, including the shouting boys in the carriage\nbehind, was eager to point it out, especially when Agatha made the\nlamentable confession that she had never seen a ruined castle in her\nlife before.\n\n\"And you might go all over England and not find such another as this,\"\nsaid Mr. Dugdale, riding up to her with a smile of great satisfaction.\n\"Nobody thinks much of it in these parts, and few antiquarians ever come\nand poke about it. Perhaps it's as well. They couldn't find out more\nthan we know already. But no!\"--and his eye, taking in the noble\nold ruin arched over by the broad sky, assumed its peculiar dreamy\nexpression--\"We don't know anything. Nobody knows anything about this\nwonderful world!\"\n\nAgatha looked around. On the top of a smooth conical hill, each side of\nwhich was guarded by other two hills equally smooth and bare, rose the\nwreck of the magnificent fortress, enough of the walls remaining to show\nits extent and plan. Its destroyer had been--not Father Time, who does\nhis work quietly and gracefully--but that worse spoiler, man. Huge\nmasses of masonry, hurled from the summit, lay in the moat beneath,\nfixed as they had been for centuries, with vegetation growing over them.\nSome of the walls, undermined and shaken from their foundations, took\nstrange, oblique angles, yet refused to fall. Marks of cannon-balls were\nindented on the stonework of the battered gateway, which still remained\na gateway--probably the very same under which Queen Elfrida, \"fair and\nfalse,\" had offered to her son the stirrup-cup.\n\nThe general impression left on the mind was not that of natural decay,\nsolemn and holy, but of sudden destruction, coming unawares, and\nstruggled against, as a man in the flower of life struggles with\nmortality. There was something very melancholy about the ruined fortress\nleft on the hill-top in sight of the little town close below, where its\ndesolation was unheeded. Agatha, sensitive, enthusiastic, and easily\nimpressed, grew silent, and wondered that her companions could laugh\nso carelessly, even when passing under the grey portal into the very\nprecincts of the deserted castle.\n\n\"We shall not find a soul here,\" said Harrie; \"scarcely anybody ever\ncomes at this season, except when our Kingcombe Oddfellows' Club have\na picnic on this bowling-green; or schoolboys get together and climb\nup the ivy to frighten the jackdaws--my husband has done it many a\ntime--haven't you, Duke?\"\n\n\"I see mamma,\" vaguely responded Duke, who was busy lifting his boys\ndown from the carriage, with a paternal care and tenderness beautiful\nto see. He then, with one little fellow on his shoulder, another holding\nhis hand, and a third clinging to his coat-tails, strode off up the\ngreen ascent, without paying the slightest attention to Mrs. Harper.\nWhich dereliction from the rules of politeness it never once came into\nher mind to notice or to blame.\n\n\"There they go! Nobody minds me; it's all Pa!\" said Mrs. Dugdale, with\nan assumption of wrath; a very miserable pretence, while her look was so\nhappy and fond. \"You see, Agatha, what you'll come to--after ten years'\nmatrimony!\"\n\nAgatha's heart was so full, she could not laugh but sighed, yet it was\nnot with unhappiness.\n\nHe and Harrie wandered over the castle together, for the two Miss\nHarpers did not approve of climbing. The little boys and \"Pa\" reappeared\nnow and then at all sorts of improbable and terrifically dangerous\ncorners, and occasionally Mrs. Dugdale made frantic darts after them.\nEspecially when they were all seen standing on one of the topmost\nprecipices, the father giving a practical scientific lesson on the\nmomentum of falling bodies; in illustration of which Harrie declared he\nwould certainly throw little Brian out of his arms, in a fit of absence\nof mind, thoroughly believing the child was a stone.\n\nAt last, when their excitement had fairly worn itself out, and even Mrs.\nDugdale's energetic liveliness had come to a dead stop in consequence\nof a fit of sleepiness and crossness on the part of Brian--Agatha roamed\nabout the old castle by herself; creeping into all the queer nooks with\na childish pleasure, mounting impassable walls so as to find the highest\npoint of view. She always had a great delight in climbing, and in\nfeeling herself at the top of everything.\n\nIt was such a strange afternoon too, grey, soft, warm, the sun having\nlong gone in and left an atmosphere of pleasant cloudiness, tender and\ndim, the shadowing over of a fading day, which nevertheless foretells no\nrain, but often indicates a beautiful day to-morrow. Somehow or other,\nit made Agatha think of Miss Valery; nor was she surprised when,\nas suddenly as if she had dropped out of the sky, Anne was seen\napproaching.\n\n\"Let me help you up these stones. How good of you to come, and how tired\nyou seem!\"\n\n\"Oh no, I shall be rested in a minute. But I am not quite so young as\nyou, my dear.\"\n\nShe came up and leaned against the ivy-wall that Agatha had climbed,\nwhich was on the opposite side of the hill to the bowling-green, the\ngathering-spot of the little party. It was a nook of thorough solitude\nand desolation, nothing being visible from it but the widely extended\nflat of country, looking seaward, though the sea itself was not in view.\n\n\"Why did you climb so high?\" said Agatha, as, earnestly regarding her\nfriend, she perceived more than ever before the difference in their\nyears, and felt strongly tempted to wrap her strong young arms round\nMiss Valery's waist, and support her with even a daughter's care.\n\n\"I shall be well presently,\" Anne repeated, with cheerfulness. \"I have\nnot climbed up to this spot for many years. I thought I would like to\ncome here once again.\"\n\nShe sat down on a flat stone raised upon two others.\n\n\"What a comfortable seat! It might have been made on purpose for you.\"\n\n\"So it was--long ago. No one has disturbed it since. Come, my dear.\"\n\nShe drew Agatha beside her--there was just room for two; and they sat in\nsilence, looking at the view, except that Agatha sometimes cast her eyes\nabout rather restlessly. It was a magical answer to her thoughts when\nAnne observed:\n\n\"I met your husband as I drove through Kingcombe. He desired me to\ntell you he was detained a little, but would be here ere long. How very\nthoughtful and good he is!\"\n\nAgatha said \"Yes\"--a mere \"Yes,\" quiet and low.\n\nMiss Valery made no further remark, but sat a long time, absently\ngazing over the low-lying sweep of country which gradually melted into a\ngreyness that looked like sea.\n\n\"Is it the sea?\" asked Mrs. Harper.\n\n\"No, it lies yonder, behind the hill opposite--where there is the smoke\nof the furze burning. From that spot I should think one could trace the\nline of coast almost to Weymouth. Do you remember ever seeing Weymouth?\"\n\n\"No! how could I?\" returned Agatha, surprised by the suddenness of the\nquestion, and its form. \"I never was in Dorsetshire before.\"\n\nAnne said something, either in jest or earnest, about one's often\nfancying one has seen places in a previous existence, and changed the\ntheme by pointing out the view on the other hand. \"My house, Thornhurst,\nlies in that direction. You must come and see me soon, and we will talk\nmore pleasantly than I can do to-day. It is so strange to be sitting\nhere with Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\n\n\"Why so? What makes you so often call me by that name?\"\n\n\"Only a whim I have. But is it not a good name--a beautiful name? Ah,\nyou child!--you poor little one! To think of _you_ becoming Mrs. Locke\nHarper!\"\n\nThere was a pathos--a kind of tender retrospection in Anne Valery's\nmanner as she touched the brown curls and smoothed the neat dress,\nwhich--riding hat and skirt having been laid aside or tucked up--made\na pretty mountain-maiden out of Nathanael's wife. Agatha never could\nunderstand the peculiar fondness with which Miss Valery sometimes\nregarded her--to-day especially. She seemed constantly on the point of\nsaying something--which she never did say. At last she rose from the\nstone seat.\n\n\"We will talk another day. We must go now.\" Yet she lingered. \"Just\nlet us stand here, in this exact spot; and look at the view.\" She\nlooked--her eyes absorbing it from every point, as one drinks in, for\nthe last time, a long-familiar draught of landscape beauty.. \"My dear!\"\n\nThe whisper was strangely soft--even solemn.\n\n\"You will remember, dear, it was I that brought you here first. You'll\ncome here sometimes, will you not?\"\n\n\"Oh, very often indeed! It is a delicious place.\"\n\n\"I thought so when I was your age. And you'll not forget the stone seat,\nAgatha? I hope no one will disturb it. Good-bye! poor old stone.\"\n\nSaying this in a whisper, she stooped and patted it with her hand--the\nthin white hand that might once have been so round, pretty, and young.\nThe act, natural even to childishness, might have made Agatha smile,\nbut for a certain something about Miss Valery that invested with dignity\neven her simplicities. So, merely echoing \"Goodbye, old stone!\" she\nfollowed Anne down the slope.\n\nAfter a loud-lamenting adieu, especially from the Dugdale boys, Miss\nValery mounted her little carriage and drove away into the gathering\nshadow--Agatha knew not where.\n\n\"What a good woman she is! I wish we were all like her!\" she said,\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"My dear, nobody can be, especially with a husband and four children. It\nis a blessing to society in general that Anne Valery never married.\"\n\n\"But people do marry late in life sometimes. So may she. Do you think\nshe will?\"\n\n\"Can't say! Don't know! Very mysterious!\" ejaculated Harrie. \"My brother\nFred once hinted--and Fred was a very fascinating young fellow when I\nwas a child--But all that belongs to the year One. I'll hold my tongue.\"\n\nAgatha had too much delicacy to inquire further. Still, it seemed very\nodd that there should be a general impression of Anne's early attachment\nto Major Harper, in contradistinction to the old Squire's regretful hint\nthat she had refused his eldest son. But these scraps of romance, so far\nback in the past, were useless searching.\n\n\"An excellent woman is Anne Valery,\" continued Harrie--\"really\nexcellent: but sometimes rather a bore to her friends who have families.\nMy Duke often forgets he has four children to provide for, when he\nlistens to her charitable schemes. 'Twas but the other day he and she\nwere mad about some starving Cornish miners that she sent poor Mr.\nWilson to look after.\"\n\n\"Ah, I remember,\" cried Agatha, now interested in things which she had\nbefore heard indifferently. She was thirsting for some opportunity of\ndoing good--of redeeming the long waste of idle years and unemployed\nfortune. \"Do tell me about those miners.\"\n\n\"Little to tell, my dear. Only philanthropic ideas about helping poor\nwretches that had been thrown out of work by some cheating speculators\nshutting up the mines. Anne sent Wilson to find out who the man was, and\nwhat could be done. After that I never heard any more of it, nor did my\nhusband either.--Stop--don't run and question him! For goodness' sake\nlet the nonsense drop out of his poor dear head.\"\n\nAgatha, thus rebuffed, ceased her inquiries, but she inwardly resolved\nto find out all about the Cornish miners, and consult with her husband\nabout assisting them. He could not object to this good deed--it should\nbe done as privately as ever he liked--she would take care not even to\nmake mention of it before anybody, as in the matter of the subscription.\nAnd surely, though he was strange and had his peculiar notions,\nNathanael was generous at heart, and would not thwart her in anything\nreally essential, especially when she only wished to follow in the steps\nof Anne Valery, and use worthily her large fortune.\n\nWith these thoughts elevating and cheering her mind, she sat and watched\nfor her husband until he came. She was so glad to see him that she quite\nforgot to inquire about the house. He seemed at first expectant of her\nquestions, and rather grave, but at last gave himself up to the general\nmerry mood.\n\nOnce only, when they were riding homeward side by side, the fading\nsunset before them, and the low moon hiding herself behind the great\nblack hill of Corfe, Nathanael suddenly said:\n\n\"My dear Agatha, perhaps you would like me to tell you\"--\n\n\"No,\" she cried, with a quick instinct of reluctance. \"Tell me nothing\nto-night. Let us be happy for this one day.\"\n\nHer husband sighed, and was silent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\"Agatha, will you come out and walk with me?\"\n\n\"Do you not see it is raining?\"\n\nHe had not indeed, though he had stood at the window in meditation ever\nsince breakfast-time. As for Agatha, she had been so tired with her\nexcursion the previous day that she had done nothing but sleep, and\nhad scarcely opened her lips to her husband or to any one. Now, on this\nrainy day, she felt the reaction of her high spirits--was dull, dreamy;\nwished her husband would come and talk to her, and \"make a baby\" of\nher. She could not think why he stood at that odious window, pondering,\ncounting rain-drops apparently, and then made the unaccountable\nproposition of a walk.\n\n\"Raining, is it?\" He looked up at the murky sky. \"What a change from\nlast night.\"\n\n\"I did not know you were so subject to elemental influences?\"\n\n\"We all are, more or less; but I was just then thinking about other\nthings than what I spoke of. My dear wife, I want to talk to you very\nmuch. Where shall we go, so as not to be interrupted?\"\n\n\"Anywhere you like,\" said she, resigning herself to her fate and to a\nlong argument, which she supposed was about the new house. She did\nnot remember about it clearly, but she had a floating suspicion that\nNathanael was determined to settle the matter soon, and that she\nshould have a hard struggle between the pretty house she liked, and Mr.\nWilson's cottage, which her husband so unaccountably preferred. This was\na matter in which she could not yield, come what might. Therefore\nthe \"anywhere you like\" was in rather an ungracious manner. He seemed\ndetermined not to observe this.\n\n\"Suppose we go into the conservatory;--you have never seen it. But put\non something to keep you warm.\"\n\nHe wrapped Mary's crimson garden-shawl over her head--clumsily enough,\nfor Mr. Harper was not a \"ladies' man;\" his whole character and habits\nof life being in curious opposition to the extreme delicacy which Nature\nhad externally stamped upon his appearance. Pausing, he held his wife at\narm's length, gazing at her admiringly.\n\n\"Will that do? What a gipsy you look, with your red shawl and brown\nface!\"\n\n\"Pawnee-face, you know! Do you remember how you once called me so, and\nhow your brother\"--\n\n\"Come, let us go,\" he said abruptly, and hurried her through the\ndrawing-rooms. Agatha was rather hurt that his aspect should change so\ncloudily, and that he should thus quench her little reminiscences of\ncourtship-days, so dear to every happy wife, and gradually becoming\ndearer even to herself. As they entered the conservatory, she shivered\nwith an uncomfortable sense of gloom.\n\n\"What a large, bare place! Even the vines look cheerless--and where have\nthey put all the flowers? What a shame to send them away, and turn it\ninto a billiard-room.\"\n\n\"It was done years ago, to please--my brother\"--(Agatha was amazed at\nthe hard tone of that tender fraternal word--so can the sense of words\nalter in the saying)--\"and my father will not have it removed.\"\n\n\"He must have been very fond of your brother,\" said Agatha, as, with\na woman's natural leaning to the injured side, she thought of Major\nHarper--his gaiety and his good-nature. She wondered why Nathanael was\nso rigid and cold in his forced and rare mentioning of his brother's\nname. As she pondered, her eyes took a serious shadow in their depths.\n\n\"What are you thinking about, Agatha?\"\n\nThe suddenness of the question--the consciousness that she might vex\nNathanael did she answer it--made her hesitate, blushing vividly--nay,\npainfully.\n\n\"No, don't tell me. I want to hear nothing, nothing, Agatha. I have\nbefore told you so. Do not be afraid.\"\n\n\"How strange you are! What should I be afraid of?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Forget I said anything. You are my wife now--mine--mine!\" and\nfor a moment he pressed her hand tightly. \"In time\"--he relinquished his\nhold with a sad smile--\"in time, Agatha, I hope we shall become used to\none another; perhaps even grow into a contented, sedate married couple.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" Alas! far more than this had been her thought--the\nthought which had dawned when she paused, shuddering over the tale of\nKing Edward the Martyr and the woman that loved him--the dim hope, daily\nrising, of an Eden not altogether lost, even though she had married so\nrashly and blindly--a hope that this might have been only the burying of\nher foolish girlish dream of love, which must needs die in order to be\nraised up again in a different form and in a new existence.\n\nSomewhat heavy-hearted, Agatha sat down on a raised bench that looked\ndown on the battered and decaying billiard-table, listening to the rain\nthat pattered on the glass roof above the vine-leaves--wondering how old\nwere the ragged-looking, flowerless, fruitless orange-trees that were\nranged on either side, the only other specimens of vegetation left.\nEvidently nobody at Kingcombe Holm cared much for flowers.\n\n\"I think we will quit this dull place. You do not seem to like it,\nAgatha?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I like it well enough. I like the rain falling, falling, and\nthe vine-branches crushing themselves against the panes. They'll never\nripen, never--poor things! They are dying for sun, and it will not--will\nnot shine!\"\n\n\"Agatha, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I don't clearly know what I mean. Never mind. Talk to me\nabout--whatever it was that you brought me to unfold. Be quick--I have\nnot a large stock of patience, you know of old.\"\n\n\"Do not laugh, for I am serious. I wanted to talk to you about our new\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Our new house! Where and what like is it to be, I wonder!\"\n\n\"Do you not recollect?\"\n\n\"No; the two we looked at would not do,\" said Agatha, determinedly. She\nguessed what was coming--that the discussion about Wilson's cottage,\nwhich Nathanael seemed so to have set his heart upon, was about to be\nrenewed. But she would never consent to that--never! \"The house I liked\nyou did not approve of,\" she continued, observing her husband's silence.\n\"The other I could not think of for a moment.\"\n\n\"But supposing there was no alternative, since we must settle at once?\"\n\n\"This is the first time you have condescended to inform me of that\nnecessity.\"\n\n\"If,\" he went on, taking no notice of her sharp speech, but speaking\nwith the extreme gentleness of one who himself feels tenfold the pain he\nis compelled to inflict--\"if, as I told you yesterday, we ought to form\nour plans immediately; and since, Kingcombe being such a small place,\nthere is at present no choice left us but those two houses\"--\n\n\"Build one! We are rich enough.\"\n\n\"Not quite.\" His eyes dropped, almost like those of guilt. After a\npause, he cried out violently:\n\n\"Agatha, a secret at one's heart is ten times worse to the keeper of it\nthan it can be to any one else. Have pity for me, have patience with me,\njust for a little while.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? What have you done?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said he. \"Nothing to harm your peace, my little wife. Believe\nme, I have committed no greater crime, than\"--\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Than having taken Wilson's cottage.\"\n\nHe tried by smiling to teach her to make light of it--perhaps because it\nwas a thing so light to him. But Agatha was enraged beyond endurance.\n\n\"You have absolutely taken it--that mean, wretched hovel that I told you\nI hated;--taken it secretly, without my knowledge or consent!\"\n\n\"You mistake there. I told you we were obliged to decide yesterday; you\nwere unwilling to consult with me, and at last--do you remember? you\nleft the decision in my hands. I merely believed your own words, and\nknowing the necessity of acting upon them, did so. I cannot think I was\nwrong.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Not at all!\" cried Agatha, laughing wildly. \"It was only like\nyou--under-handed in stealing my few pleasures--very frank and open when\nyou can rule. Never honest or candid with me, except to my punishment. A\nkind, generous husband, truly!\"\n\nThese and a torrent more of bitter words she poured out. She never knew\ntill now the passion, the galling sarcasm, there was in her nature. She\nfelt a longing to hate--a wish to wound. Every time she looked at her\nhusband, there seemed a demon rising up within her--that demon which\nlurks strangely enough in the heart's closest and tenderest depths.\n\n\"Cannot you speak!\" she cried, going up to him. \"Anything is better than\nthat wicked silence. Speak!\"\n\n\"Agatha!\"\n\n\"No--I'll not hear you. See what you have done--how you have made me\ndisgrace myself\" and she almost sobbed.--\"Never in my life was I in a\npassion before.\"\n\n\"Is it my fault then?\" said he, mournfully.\n\n\"Yes, yours. It is you who stir up all these bad feelings in me.. I was\na good girl, a happy girl, before you married me.\"\n\n\"Was it so? Then you shall be held blameless. Poor child--poor child!\"\n\nHis unutterable regret, his entire prostration, stung her to the heart,\nand silenced her for the moment; but speedily she burst out again:\n\n\"You call me a child--so perhaps I am, in years; but you should have\nthought of that before. You married me, and made me a woman. You took\naway my gay childish heart, and yet in all humiliating things you still\ntreat me like a child.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" He answered mechanically, out of thoughts that lay deep down,\nfar below the surface of his wife's bitter words. These last awoke\nin him not one ray of anger--not even when at last, in a fit of\nuncontrollable petulance, she tore his hand from before his eyes,\nbidding him look at her--if he dared.\n\n\"Yes, I dare.\" And the look she courted, arose steady, sorrowful, like\nthat of a man who turns his eyes upward, hopeless yet faithful, out of a\nwrecked ship. \"Whatever has been, or may come, God knows that, from the\nfirst, I did love you, Agatha.\"\n\nWherefore had he used the word \"did!\" Why could she not smother down\nthe unwonted pang, the new craving? Or rather, why could she not throw\nherself in his arms and cry out, \"Do you love me--do you love me now?\"\nPride--pride only--the restless wild nature upon which his reserve fell\nlike water upon fire, without the blending spirit of conscious love\nwhich often makes two opposite temperaments result in closest union.\n\nNevertheless, she was somewhat soothed, and began to compress the mass\nof imaginary wrongs into the one little wrong which had originated it\nall.\n\n\"What made you take a liking to that miserable house? I hate small\nrooms--I cannot breathe in them--I have never been used to a little\nhouse. Why must I now? I am not going to be extravagant--nobody could be\nif they tried, in a poor place like Kingcombe. Since you _will_\ninsist on our living there, and _will_ carry out your cruel pride of\nindependence\"--\n\n\"Cruel--oh, Agatha!\" He absolutely groaned.\n\n\"Wishing no extravagance, I do wish for comfort--perhaps some little\nelegance--as I have had all my life.\"\n\n\"You shall have it still, Agatha,\" her husband muttered. \"I will coin my\nheart's blood into gold but you shall have it.\"\n\n\"Now you are talking barbarously! Or else--how very very wrong am I!\nWhat can be the reason that we torture each other so?\"\n\n\"Fate!\" he cried, pacing wildly up and down. \"Fate! that has netted\nus both to our own misery--nay, worse--to make us the misery of one\nanother. Yet how could I know? You seemed a young simple girl, free to\nlove--I felt sure I could make you love me. Poor dupe that I was! Oh,\nwhy did I ever see you, Agatha Bowen?\"\n\nHe snatched his wife on his knee, and kissed her repeatedly--madly--just\nas he had done on the morning of their wedding-day; never since! Then he\nlet her go--almost with coldness.\n\n\"There--I will not vex you. I must not be foolish any more.\"\n\nFoolish! He thought it foolish to show that he loved her! Without\nreplying, Agatha sat down on the bench where her husband placed her. He\nmight say what he liked: she was very patient now.\n\nHe began to explain his reasons for taking the house; that he had\nnaturally more acquaintance with worldly matters than she had; that\nwhatever their income, it was advisable for young people to begin\nhousekeeping prudently, since it was easy to increase small beginnings,\nwhile of all outward domestic horrors there was nothing greater than the\nhorror of running into debt. When he talked thus, at once with wisdom\nand gentleness, Agatha began to forgive him.\n\n\"After all,\" said she, brightening, \"your prudence--which I might\ncall by a harder word, but I'll be good now--your prudence is only\nrestraining me in my little pleasures, and I don't much mind. But if you\never tried to restrain me in a matter of kindness, as you did yesterday,\nonly I guessed the motive\"--\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"There--don't look so startled and displeased. I saw you did not like\nthe _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of political charities. But another time, if I want to do\ngood--like Anne Valery, only in a very, very much smaller way--Hark!\nwhat is that noise?\"\n\nIt was a decent-looking working-man, standing out in the pouring rain,\nwatching them through the panes, and rattling angrily at the locked\nconservatory-door.\n\n\"What a fierce eye! It looks quite wolfish. What can he want with us?\"\n\n\"I will go and see. Some labourer wanting work, probably; but the fellow\nhas no business to come beckoning and interrupting. Stay here, Agatha.\"\n\n\"No--I will come with you.\" And she tripped after her husband, the\nmomentary content of her heart creating a longing to do good--a sort of\ntithe of happiness thankfully paid to Heaven.\n\nNathanael unfastened the glass-door, not without annoyance; for, unlike\nhis wife, _his_ joy-tithe was not yet due.\n\n\"What do you want, my good fellow?\"\n\n\"Some o' th' Harpers.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Are you after work? You don't look like one of the\nclay-cutters. Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"I be Darset, I be; but I comed fra Carnwall.\"\n\n\"From where?\" asked Agatha, puzzled by the provincialism, and attracted\nat once by the man's intelligent face, and by a keen, misery-stricken,\nhungry look, which she had truly called \"wolfish.\"\n\n\"I be comed fra the miners in Carnwall,\" reiterated the man, raising\nhis voice threateningly. \"They sent I back to Darset to see some o' th'\nHarpers.\"\n\n\"You must go in, Agatha; it is cold. I cannot have you standing here.\nGo--quick.\" And Agatha was astonished to see how pallid and eager her\nhusband looked, and how anxious he seemed to get her out of the way.\n\n\"No, thank you. I am not cold at all. I want to hear this man. Perhaps\nhe is one of the poor miners Miss Valery spoke of at Wheal--what was\nit?\"\n\n\"I be comed fra Wheal Caroline, Missus, and I do want one o' th'\nHarpers. There be the old 'un at the window! Thick's the man for we.\"\n\nAnd he was hurrying off to the bow-window of the Squire's room, which\nwas alongside of the conservatory. But Nathanael called him back\nimperatively.\n\n\"Stay, friend. My father has nothing to do with the mines--it is I. I'll\nspeak to you presently.--Some business of Anne's,\" he explained hastily\nto his wife. \"Leave us, dear.\"\n\n\"Why do you make me go in? I want to hear about the poor miners; I want\nto help them, as well as Anne Valery.\"\n\n\"Do'ee help we, Missus!\" implored the man, softened by a woman's kind\nlooks. \"Do'ee give we some'at to keep 'un fra starving!\"\n\n\"Starving!\" cried Agatha in horror. And even her husband's anxiety\nwas for the moment quelled in the deep pity which overspread his\ncountenance.\n\n\"It be nigh that, I tell'ee. Us be no cheats--there be other folk as has\ncheated we. Fine grand folk as knew nowt o' the mines, but shut 'un up,\nand paid no money.\"\n\n\"How wicked!\"\n\n\"But I be come to find 'un out,\" cried the man fiercely, as his eye lit\non Nathanael. \"For I do know thick fine folk. And I tell'ee\"--\n\n\"Silence! you forget you are speaking before a lady. Wait for me, and I\nwill talk with you.\"\n\n\"Will'ee, Mister? Don't'ee cheat, now!\" said the miner, with a rude\nattempt at a sneer.\n\nThe young man's cheek flushed, but he said very quietly--\n\n\"I promise you, I will speak with you here in half-an-hour. I am\nNathanael Harper--Mr. Harper's youngest son.\"\n\nAfter a minute's keen observation, the miner pulled off his cap\nrespectfully. \"Thank'ee, sir! You bean't _he_, I see. But you be th' old\nSquire's son, and--I be Darset, I be!\"\n\nAnother bow--the involuntary respect to the ancient county family from\nhonest labour born upon its ancestral sod, and the man leaned exhausted\nagainst the ragged stem of one of the old vines.\n\n\"Missus,\" he said, looking up hungrily--at the lady this time--\n\"Missus, do'ee gie 'un a bit o' bread!\"\n\nAgatha, full of compassion, was eager to send the servants or take him\ninto the kitchen, or even fetch him his dinner with her own hands. Mr.\nHarper interfered.\n\n\"I will bring him some food myself. Stay here, my man; don't stir hence.\nRemember, you have nothing to do with my father.\"\n\nThere was a warning severity in the tone which annoyed Agatha. Why did\nher husband speak harshly to the poor miner?\n\nStill she obeyed Mr. Harper's evident wish that she should go away; and\nspent the time in Elizabeth's room, telling her of this little incident.\n\nMiss Harper listened with all the quick intelligence of her bright eyes.\nThe only remark she made was:\n\n\"What could have led this miner to come back to Dorsetshire after our\nfamily?\"\n\nAgatha had never thought of this, indeed she did not want to think. Her\nheart was brimming with charity. She longed to empty it out in a torrent\nof benefactions, to which even Anne Valery's constant stream of good\ndeeds appeared measured and slow. Elizabeth watched her with a strange\npiercing expression--Elizabeth, who from her silent nest seemed to\nbehold all things clearer, like a spirit sitting halfway in upper air,\nto whose passionless wide vision distant mazes take form and proportion.\nOften, there was something almost supernatural in Elizabeth and her\nattentive eyes.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said at last, when Agatha paused for a response to her\nown enthusiasm, \"Man proposes--God disposes! Go and talk over these\nthings with your husband first.\" Agatha went.\n\nShe met Nathanael on the staircase, going up to their own room.\n\n\"Ah; is it you? I am so glad. Come and tell me what has been done about\nthe poor miner.\"\n\n\"He is gone. I have sent him back to Cornwall.\"\n\n\"What, so soon? Not to starve at that Wheal--Wheal something or other--I\nalways forget the name?\"\n\n\"Do forget it. Don't let the matter trouble my little wife. Let her run\ndown-stairs and think of something else.\"\n\nHe patted her head with assumed carelessness, and was passing her by;\nbut she stopped him.\n\n\"Ah! there it is--I am always to be a child! I am to run down-stairs\nand think of something else, while you go and shut yourself up to\nponder over this affair. But I will not be shut out; I will go with\nyou;--come!\"\n\nIn playful force she drew him to their room, and closed the door.\n\n\"Now, sit down, and tell me the whole story. Why, how grave and pale\nit has made you look! But never mind; we'll find out a plan to help the\npoor people.\"\n\nHe gave some inarticulate assent, which checked her by its coldness,\nsank on the chair she placed, and folded his fingers tightly in one\nanother, so that Agatha could not even strengthen herself in the bold\nprojects she was about to communicate, by stealing her own into her\nhusband's hand. However, she placed herself on the floor at his feet, in\nthe attitude of a Circassian beauty; or--she accidentally thought--not\nunlike a Circassian slave.\n\n\"Begin, please! I must hear about these mines.\"\n\n\"I doubt if you could understand,--at least with the few explanations I\nam able to give you at present.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I'll try. Why are the poor men starving in this way?\"\n\n\"You heard but now. Because the mines were first opened on a\nspeculation, worked carelessly--dishonestly I fear--till the\nspeculator's money failed, and the vein stopped. Then the miners being\nthrown out of employ were reduced to great distress, as this man tells\nme.\"\n\n\"But why should he have come here after your father?\"\n\n\"And,\" continued Nathanael, in a quick and rather inexplicable\ncorrelative, \"the mines were lately sold as waste land. Anne Valery\nbought them.\"\n\n\"Why did she do that?\"\n\n\"Out of charity; that she might begin some employment--flax-growing, I\nthink--to find food for the poor people. There the tale's ended, my Lady\nInquisitive. Will you go down to my sisters?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I want to talk to you a little--a very little longer. May I?\"\n\nAnd she drooped her head, blushing as the young will blush over the same\ncharitable feeling which the old and hardened ostentatiously parade.\n\nMr. Harper gazed hopelessly around, as if longing any means of escape\nand solitude. His wife saw him and was pained.\n\n\"What--are you tired of me?\"\n\n\"No, no, dear, Only I am so busy--and have so many things to think about\njust now.\"\n\n\"Tell me some of them.\"\n\n\"What--tell you all my business mysteries,\" he returned, playfully.\n\"Didn't you say to me once, before we were married, that you hated\nsecrets, and never could keep one in your life?\"\n\n\"It is true--quite true. I do hate them,\" cried Agatha.\n\n\"And for all your smiling, I know you are keeping back something from me\nnow.\"\n\n\"Foolish little wife!\"\n\n\"Foolish--but still a wife. Look at me and tell the truth. Is there\nanything in your heart which I do not know?\"\n\n\"Yes, Agatha, several things.\"\n\nThe sudden change from jest to deep earnest startled the wife so much\nthat she was struck dumb.\n\n\"Circumstances may happen,\" he continued, \"which a husband cannot always\ntell to his wife, especially a man of my queer temper and lonely ways.\nI always knew that the woman I married would have much to bear from me.\nDid I not tell her so, poor little Agatha?\" And he tried to take her\nhand.\n\n\"You are talking in this way to soothe me, but I know well what you\nmean. No husband ever really thinks himself in fault, but his wife. Emma\nalways said so.\"\n\nMr. Harper dropped the unwilling hand; but the next moment, by a strong\neffort, reclaimed it firmly.\n\n\"Agatha, are we beginning again to be angry with one another? Is there\nnever to be peace between us?\"\n\n\"Peace\" only? Nothing closer, dearer? Yet what was it that, as Agatha\nlooked at her husband, made her think even his \"peace\" better than any\nother's love?\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, after watching him long in silence--\"yes, there\nshall be peace. Whatever I am, I know how good you are. And,\" she added,\ngaily, \"now let me unfold a plan of mine for proving how good we both\nare.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I want some money--a good deal.\"\n\nMr. Harper turned away. \"Wherefore?\"\n\n\"Cannot you guess? I thought you would at once--nay, that you would be\nthe first to propose it. I am glad I am first. Now, do guess.\"\n\n\"I had rather not, if it is a serious matter. If otherwise, I am hardly\nquite merry enough for jests to-day. Tell me.\"\n\n\"It is a very simple thing, though it has cost me half-an-hour's\npuzzling. I never thought so much about business in all my life.\nWell,\"--she hesitated.\n\n\"Go on, Agatha.\"\n\n\"I want--it must come out--I want you to take half or all of my--_our_\nmoney which is in the Funds (as I believe Major Harper said, though I\nhave not the least idea what Funds are)--and with it to buy a new mine,\nand set the poor miners all working again; they'll like it a great deal\nbetter than flax-growing. And perhaps we could afterwards build schools\nand cottages, and do oceans of good. Oh! how glad I am I was born an\nheiress!\"\n\nShe rose, her eyes brightening; her little figure dilated; she had never\nlooked so lovely--so loveable. And yet the husband sat as it were stone\nblind and dumb.\n\n\"You cannot have any objection to this, I know,\" Agatha went on. \"It is\nnot like giving money openly away--making a show of charity. Nobody need\nknow but that we do it on our own account--just to increase our riches;\"\nand she laughed merrily at the idea. \"Think now--how much money would it\ntake?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"A great deal, probably, since you look so serious over it,\" said the\nwife, a little vexed. \"Perhaps my plan is foolish in some things; but I\nthink it is right, and I am very firm--firmer than you imagine--when\nI feel I am in the right. Surely, living so cheaply in that tiny\nhouse--and we will live cheaper still if you choose--we shall have\nplenty to spare. We must do this. Say that we shall.\"\n\nHer husband was silent.\n\nGradually the blush of enthusiasm deepened into that of annoyance--real\nanger. \"Mr. Harper, I wait until you answer me.\"\n\nAs she turned away, Nathanael looked after her. Such a flood of\ntenderness, reverence, sorrow, passion, rarely swept over a human face.\n\nThen he rose, paced up the room in his usual fashion, and down again;\npausing once at the window (a strange thing for him to notice just then)\nto let out a brown bee that, having come in for shelter from the rain,\nwanted to go out again with the sunshine. At last he came to Agatha's\nside.\n\n\"My dear wife, it grieves me to pain you by a refusal--grieves me more\nthan you can tell; but the plan you propose is utterly impracticable.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" Her colour flashed, darkened of a stormy red, and paled. She\nwas exercising very great self-restraint.\n\n\"I will ask less,\" she resumed, bitterly. \"I had forgotten the extreme\nprudence of your character. Give me just what _you_ think is sufficient\nfor charity.\" And her lip tried not to curl--her heart tried not to\ndespise her husband.\n\nNathanael gave no answer.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, three--four times lately you have denied me what I asked.\nThrice it was merely my own pleasure--which I relinquished. This time it\nis a matter of principle, and I will not yield. Will you--since I have\nmade you master of my fortune--will you allow me enough out of it for\nmy own slight gratification? That at least is but justice.\"\n\n\"Justice!\" echoed Nathanael, his features sinking gradually into the\nrigidity they sometimes wore--a warning of how much the gentleness of\nhis nature could bear.\n\n\"Hear me for one minute, Agatha. I know this is hard, very hard for you.\nI have prevented your living in London; I have taken a smaller house\nthan you like; I have restricted you in acts of charity. But for all\nthese things I have reasons.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me those reasons?\" It was a tone, not of entreaty, but\nof threatening--such as a man rarely hears from a woman without all the\npride within him recoiling into obstinacy.\n\nMr. Harper grew yet paler, though still his answer was soft--\"Agatha, do\nnot ask me. I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"You dare not! You are ashamed!\"\n\nHe walked away from her. When he returned, it was less the lover that\nspoke than the man. \"I am not ashamed of anything I do, and I have clear\nmotives for all. I only desire my wife to have patience for awhile, and\ntrust her husband.\"\n\n\"I trust my husband!\" she cried, in violent passion--\"When he acts\noutrageously, unjustly, insultingly--binds me hand and foot like a\nchild, and then smiles and tells me 'to be patient!' When he has secrets\nfrom me--when, for all I know, his whole conduct may have been one long\ndeceit towards me.\"\n\n\"Take care, Agatha.\" The words were said between his teeth, and then the\nlips closed in that strong straight line which made his face look all\niron.\n\n\"I say it may have been--I have heard of such things\"--and she laughed\nfearfully at the horrible thought a tempting devil was putting into her\nmind--\"I have heard of young girls--poor desolate creatures, cursed\nwith riches, and having no one to guard them--of some stranger coming\nand marrying them hastily, but not for love--oh, not for love!\" And her\nlaughter grew absolutely frightful in its mockery. \"How do I know but\nthat you thus married me?\"\n\nHer wild eyes fixed themselves on her husband. She saw his face change\nto very ghastliness, and guilt itself could not have trembled more than\nthe shudder which ran through his frame.\n\n\"I was right,\" she gasped, her passion subdued into cold horror--\"you\ndid marry me for my money!\"\n\nNo answer--not a breath--only an incredulous stare. Once more Agatha's\npassion rose, a sea of wrath, misery, despair, that dashed her blindly\non, she recked not where.\n\n\"I see it all now--all your wickedness. You never loved me, you only\nloved my riches. You have them now, and so you can stand there and gaze\nat me, as hard, as dumb as a stone. But I will make you hear--I will\nshriek it into your silence again--again--You married me for my money!\"\n\nStill no word. The silence she spoke of was awful. Nathanael stood\nupright, his hands knotted together, the lids dropping over his eyes.\nHe neither looked at her nor at anything. There was not the slightest\nexpression in his face--it might have been carved in granite. When at\nlast almost to see if he were living man, Agatha clutched his arm, it\nalso felt hard, immoveable, like a granite rock.\n\n\"Mr. Harper!\" she cried, terror mingling with the outburst of her rage.\n\nHe merely lifted his eyes and looked at the door.--Not once--oh! never\nonce at her!\n\n\"Ay, I will go,\" she answered--\"most gladly, most thankfully! I will run\nanywhere to escape your presence.\"\n\nShe crossed the room and tried to unfasten the door, which she had\nherself bolted a little while before, out of play; but her trembling\nfingers were useless. She was obliged to call her husband's help, and he\ncame.\n\nPerfectly silent, without a single glance towards her, he undid the\nfastening, and set the door open for her to pass. A pang of fear, nay\nremorse, came over Agatha.\n\n\"Speak,\" she cried--\"if only one word, speak!\"\n\nHis lips moved, as though framing an inarticulate \"No,\" and then closed\nagain in that iron line. He still stood holding the door.\n\nHardly knowing what she did, Agatha sprang past the threshold and\ntottered a few steps on. Then turning, she saw the door shut behind her,\nslowly, noiselessly, but _it was shut_. She felt as if the door of hope\nhad been shut upon her heart.\n\nShe turned again, and fled away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIt was late afternoon. The rain had ceased, and glowed into one of those\nsoft October days, so exquisitely sunny and fair. The light glimmered\nthrough the closed Venetian blinds of \"Anne's room,\" and danced on the\ncarpet and about Agatha's feet as she sat, quiet at last, and tried to\nremember how she had come and how long she had been there. She had seen\nno one; nobody ever came into \"Anne's room.\"\n\nThe dressing-bell rang--the only sound she had heard in the house for\nhours.\n\nShe started up, waking to the frightful certainty that all was\nreal--that the ways of the household were going on just as usual--that\nshe must rouse up, no matter staggering under what burden of misery, and\ngo through her daily part, as if nothing had happened, and nothing was\nabout to happen.\n\nNothing? when this day, perhaps this same hour, must decide one of two\nthings--whether she were a wretched wife, bound for life to a man\nwho married her solely for mercenary motives, or whether she were\na wife--perhaps in this even more wretched--who had so wronged and\ninsulted her husband that nothing ever could win his forgiveness or\nrestore his love. His love, which, as she now dimly began to see, and\nshuddered in the seeing, was becoming to her the most precious thing in\nexistence.\n\nNever, until she sat there, quite alone, and feeling what it was to be\nleft alone, after being so watched and cherished---never until now had\nshe understood what the world would be to her if doomed to question her\nhusband's honour or to outlive her husband's love.\n\n\"It must have been all a dream,\" she said, moving her cold fingers to\nand fro over her forehead. \"He never could have wronged me so, or I him.\nHe must surely explain, and I will ask his pardon for what I said in my\npassion--Unless, indeed, my accusation were true.\"\n\nBut she could not think of that possibility now--it maddened her.\n\n\"I shall meet him soon. I wonder how he will meet me. That will decide\nall.--Hark!\"\n\nShe listened--with a vague expectation of footsteps at the door. But no\none came.\n\n\"I suppose he is in his room still--our room.\" And all the solemn union\nof married life--the perpetual presence, the never parting night nor\nday, which makes estrangement in that tie worse than in any other human\nbond--rushed upon her with unutterable terror.\n\n\"If he has deceived and wronged me, how shall I endure the sight of him?\nIf I have outraged him, and he will not forgive me--oh, what will become\nof me?\"\n\nShe heard various bells ringing throughout the house, and knew that she\nhad no time to lose. She rose up feebly, with that aching numbed feeling\nwhich strong agitation leaves in the whole frame, and tottered to the\nmirror.\n\n\"I must look at myself, to see that there is nothing strange about me,\nin case I meet any one in the passages.--Oh, what a face!\"\n\nIt was sallow, blanched, with dark shadows round the eyes, and dark\nlines drawn everywhere. That first storm of wild passion--that agony of\nremorse following, had left indelible marks. She seemed ten years older\nsince she had last beheld herself, which was when she pulled out her\nlong curls in the morning. She pulled them out mechanically now, trying\nto make of them a screen to hide the poor face that she had used to\nfancy they adorned. Then she flew like a frightened creature along the\npassages, and without meeting any one, reached her chamber-door. It was\na little way open; she need not knock then--knock and wait trembling for\nthe answer. Perhaps Mr. Harper was not there, and so for a few minutes\nshe was safe from the dreaded meeting. She went in.\n\nThe room was empty, but her husband's handkerchief and riding-gloves\nwere lying about; he had apparently just gone down-stairs. Nevertheless,\nthough a relief, it was rather a shock to her to find the room deserted.\nShe felt a weight in its silence, forewarning her of she knew not what;\nshe looked round inquiringly, as if the walls could tell her what had\npassed within them since she left. At last she took up her husband's\ngloves and laid them by with a care foreign to her general habit, and\nwith a strange tenderness. When Mary's maid answered her summons,\nshe could not forbear asking, carelessly, but with an inward\nheart-beat--\"Where was Mr. Harper?\"\n\n\"Mr. Locke Harper, ma'am, is sitting reading to master in the library.\"\n\nHe then could sit and read quietly to his father. With him, too, all\nhousehold ways went on unaltered--with her only was the tempest--the\ndespair. Her remorse ebbed down--her pride and anger rose. Light--a\nfierce flashing light--came to her eyes, and crimson roses to her\ncheeks. She dressed herself with care, and went down--though not until\nthe last minute--to the drawing-room.\n\nMary met her at the door. \"I was just coming to fetch you. Nathanael\nsaid you had been sitting in Anne's room.\"\n\nHow could he know? Had he watched her?\n\nShe answered flippantly, \"'Tis very true. I have been enjoying my\nown company. Very good company too. Have I detained you, though? Is\neverybody here?\"\n\nEverybody was here. _He_ was here. Though she never glanced that way,\nshe saw him, and the look he wore. To others it might seem his ordinary\nlook, a little paler, a little more reserved, but she knew what it\nmeant. She knew likewise, now that her passion had subsided, how his\nwhole life--his stainless life--gave the lie to the accusation she had\ncast upon him. She had outraged him in the keenest point where a proud\nhonourable man can be outraged by his wife; her own hand had cleft a\ngulf between them which might never close.\n\nAt the thought her heart seemed dropping down--down in her bosom, like\na bird whose wing is broken, it knows not how. Sick, giddy, she clung to\nMary's arm for a moment.\n\n\"Nathanael, look here. What is the matter with your wife?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Agatha cried. \"I have only stupified myself with--with\nthinking. I will think no more--no more.\"\n\nShe tossed her head back with a fierce laugh. Her husband, who had\nhalf-risen at Mary's call, resumed his seat, making no remark.\n\nHe had never been used to show her much fondness or attention before\nhis family, so it did not appear strange that in the few minutes\nbefore dinner he should talk to his sisters, and leave his wife to\nthe courtesies of his father. For it was now an acknowledged fact at\nKingcombe Holm that the Squire was growing very fond of Agatha.\n\nDinner came, the long, dreadful dinner, with the brilliant light\nglimmering in her face, and showing every expression there; with old\nMr. Harper leaning forward to address her every time she relapsed\ninto silence; with the consciousness upon her that there was no medium\ncourse, that she must talk and laugh, fast and recklessly, or else fall\ninto tears; with the knowledge, worst of all, that there was one\nsitting at the bottom of the table whom she dared not look at, but whom\nnevertheless she perpetually saw.\n\nHer husband had taken his usual place, and sustained it in his usual\nmanner. There was the same brotherly chat with Mary and Eulalie,\nthe same answers to his father, and when once, in the dinner-table\ncourtesies, he addressed his wife, the tone was precisely as it had ever\nbeen.\n\nAgatha could have shrieked back her answer, betraying him to all the\nhousehold! This smooth outside of daily life--and with what below? It\nwas horrible.\n\nYet she felt herself powerless to burst through it. His perfect silence,\nleaving his honour, the honour of both, in her hands, was like a chain\nof iron wrapped round her; however she writhed and dashed herself\nagainst it, there it was.\n\nThe Squire seemed to remain at table longer than ever to-day. He would\nnot let his woman-kind depart. He had many toasts to give, and various\nold reminiscences to unfold to his daughter-in-law. She heard all in\na misty dream, and kept on vaguely smiling. At last the purgatory was\nended, and they rose.\n\nNathanael held the door open for his wife and sisters to retire--things\nwent on so formally even in the every-day life at Kingcombe Holm. In\npassing, Agatha felt as if she must burst through that icy barrier he\nhad drawn; she _must_ meet her husband's look, and compel him to meet\nhers. She gave him a look, proud, threatening, yet full of hidden\nmisery. He would surely answer that.\n\nNo! No response--not even anger. Some sorrow perhaps, but a sorrow that\nwas stern, hopeless, undemonstrative, as was his own nature. If any\nwreck had been, it had already sank down into those deep waters, of\nwhich the surface appeared perpetually calm.\n\nAgatha threw him back another look. Scorn was there and hatred--she felt\nas though she did really hate him at that moment. Her heart gave a\nleap, like a smitten deer, and then a \"laughing devil\" seemed to enter\ntherein, and dash her on--anywhere--to anything.\n\n\"Come, Mary--come Eulalie, we must be very merry tonight, and my husband\nmust join, for all his solemnity. Shake it off quick, Mr. Harper, or\nwe'll call you a deciever--a smooth-faced, smiling cheat.\"\n\nLaughing out loud--she caught his hand, wrung it violently, and struck\nit aside.\n\n\"How comical you are!\" said the languid Eulalie.\n\n\"But,\" whispered sensible Mary, \"are you quite sure Nathanael liked the\njoke.\"\n\n\"Who cares?\" Yet Agatha looked back.\n\nHe had merely drawn his hand in again to the other, and his colour\nfaintly rose. Otherwise the poor, mad, passionate girl might as well\nhave dashed herself against a rock. She grew still again, with a kind of\nfear. Her very limbs tottered as she went towards the drawing-room, and\nall the time that she lay there on the sofa, Mary bustling about her and\nchattering all kinds of domestic nothings, Agatha saw, as in a vision,\nher husband's face, so beautiful in its very sternness, so pure and\nrighteous-looking, whilst she felt herself so desperately, daringly\nwicked. All the \"black, ingrained spots,\" which had become visible\nin her soul, and she knew herself to be worse than any one knew\nher--appeared gathering in one cloud, until she sickened at her own\nlikeness. For beside it rose another image--and such an one! Yet there\nwas a time when she had thought it a great sacrifice and condescension\nthat Nathanael should be allowed to love her. Now--\n\nNo, she dared not hear the cry of her heart. She dared not do anything\nbut hate him, as he must surely hate her. Had he stood before her that\nminute, she would have flung away this softness, made her flashing eyes\nburn up their tears, and appeared all indifference. He might if he chose\nbe as cold as ice, as proud as Lucifer;--she would be the same. She\nwould never once let him suspect that which this day's misery had shown\nher was kindling in her heart. A something, before which the pleasant\nlittle vanity of being adored, the content of an easy unexacting liking\nin return, fell like straws in a flame. A something which she tried to\ncall wrath and hate, but which was truly the avenging angel, Love.\n\nIt seemed an age before Mr. Harper came up-stairs. When he did, his\nfather was leaning on his arm. The old gentleman looked tired, as\nif they had been talking much, yet seemed to regard with a lingering\ntenderness his son, once so little of a favourite. Why did he? Why did\nNathanael soon or late win every one's attachment? And how could he show\nthat reverent attention to his father, that cheerful kindness to his\nsisters, while _she_ sat there, jealous of every look and word? Each\ntime he addressed any of these three, Agatha felt as if some unseen\npower were lashing her into fury.\n\nIt is a strange and terrible thing, but nevertheless true, that a good\nman, a kind man, a generous man, may sometimes quite unconsciously drive\na woman nearly mad; make her feel as though a legion of fiends were\nstruggling for possession of her soul, goad her weakness into acts which\ntorture alone causes, and the after-blackness of which, presented to\nher real self, creates a humiliation which only drives her madder still.\nMen, that is, good men, who are stronger and better able to do and\nto bear--ought to be very gentle, very wise, in the manner they deal\ntowards women. No short-coming or wrong, however great, from the weaker\nto the stronger, can merit an equal return; and according to the law\nthat the more delicate the mental and physical organisation, the\nkeener is the power of suffering; so no man, be he ever so wise or\ntender-hearted, can rightly estimate the depth of a woman's agony.\n\nAgatha rose, and went away by herself into a smaller room that led\nout of the other, not unlike her own pet sitting-room in her maiden\ndays--the room where she had once stood by the firelight, and Nathanael\nhad come in and given her the first trembling, thrilling love-kiss. She\nstood in the same attitude now. Did she remember it? Was she, in that\nshadowy corner, with glimpses of light and fragments of talk pouring\nin from the other room, dreaming over that old time--old, though it\nhappened scarcely three months ago--dreaming it over, with oh! what\ndifferent emotions!\n\nAnd when she heard a step--her ears were very quick now. Did she turn,\nand think to see her lover of old--so little loved? Alas! without\nlifting her eyes, she felt the presence was no longer that of her timid\nyoung lover, but of her husband.\n\nMr. Harper came in, and for the first time since that fearful minute\nwhen she quitted him, the husband and wife were alone. Not quite so, for\nhe had left the door wide open--purposely, she thought. There was a full\nvision of Mary playing chess with her father, and of Eulalie lounging on\nthe sofa, gazing now and then with idle curiosity into the little room.\n\nIt was insulting! Why, if he came to speak healing words, did he let his\nwhole family peer into the mysteries which ought to be strictly sacred\nbetween the two whom marriage had made one? If only he had shut the\ndoor! If only she could do it, and then turn and cling round his neck,\nor even weep at his knees--for that frantic desire did strike her for a\nmoment--anything, to win from him pardon and peace!\n\n\"Agatha, are you quite at leisure?\"\n\nTo dream of answering such a tone with a flood of tears! or of clinging\nround a neck that lifted itself up in such a marble pride! It was\nimpossible.\n\n\"I am quite at leisure, Mr. Harper.\"\n\nAt such a crisis, and between two such characters, the fate of a\nlifetime may depend upon the first word. The first word had been spoken,\nand answered.\n\nAgatha turned to the fire again, and her husband to the shadow. Either\nit was fancy, or the effect of natural contact, but the one face seemed\nto flame, the other to darken--suddenly, hopelessly--as when the last\nglimmer of light fades out upon a wall.\n\n\"Can you speak with me for a few moments?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Shall it be here?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\nAgatha sat down; smoothed her dress, and held her folded hands tight\nupon her knees, lest he should see how they were trembling.\n\nMr. Harper resumed. His tone was gentle, though with a certain\nstrangeness in it, a want of that music which runs through all\ndeep-toned low voices, and which in his was very peculiar.\n\n\"It appears to me--though nothing shall be done against your\ndecision--that, considering all things, it would be better that our stay\nin my father's house were made as short as possible.\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.\" Two long pausing words, said beneath her breath.\n\n\"Accordingly I rode to Kingcombe this afternoon, and find that we can\nenter the cottage on Saturday. To-day is Thursday\"----\n\n\"Is it?--Oh yes. I beg your pardon. Proceed.\"\n\n\"If it would be agreeable and convenient to you, I think we had better\narrange matters so. I have already told my father it was probable we\nshould leave on Saturday. Are you willing?\"\n\n\"Quite willing.\"\n\n\"It is settled then. On Saturday evening we go home.\"\n\nGo home! To their first home! To that new bridal nest, which, be it the\npoorest dwelling on earth, seems--or should seem--holy, happy, and fair!\nWhat a coming home it was! Better, she thought, that he had cast her\nadrift, or torn himself from her and placed the wide world between them.\nRather any open separation than the mockery of such a union.\n\n\"Home!\" she cried. \"I will not go--I cannot. Oh, not home!\"\n\n\"To a house, then--call it by what name you please. To your own\nhouse, which we will merely _say_ is mine. Your comfort\"--he stopped a\nlittle--\"must always be the first consideration of your husband.\"\n\n\"My husband!\" she repeated, almost in a shriek--and the old fit of\nfierce laughter was coming back.\n\nAt this moment Eulalie's curious eyes were seen turning towards the\nlittle room. Nathanael moved so as to shield his wife from them. \"Hush!\"\nhe said, sorrowfully, even with a sort of pity--\"hush, Agatha. We are\nmarried. Between us two there must be, under all circumstances, honour\nand silence.\"\n\nHis manner was so solemn, free from bitterness or anger, that Agatha's\npassion was quelled. She was awed as by the sight of some dead face,\nwronged grievously in life, but which now only revenges itself by the\nhopelessness of its mute perpetual smile. She remained staring blankly\ninto the fire, plaiting and unplaiting the sash of her dress with\nheedless fingers. Eulalie might peer safely.\n\n\"There was another thing,\" resumed Nathanael, \"which, before telling\nthe rest of the household, I wished to say to you. I had business in\nWeymouth to-morrow; and--if\"--\n\n\"Well? I listen.\"\n\n\"If--I were to ride there to-night\"--\n\n\"Go.\" A soft, quick word--a mere motion of the lips--and yet it was the\none word of doom.\n\nAfter that, without saying more, Mr. Harper walked back slowly into the\ndrawing-room, and Agatha sat by the fireside alone.\n\nShe heard the rest talking--complaining--reasoning--heard one or two\npersuasive calls for \"Agatha\"--but she never moved. Then came the\nbell hastily pulled, and the old Squire's testy summons for \"Mr. Locke\nHarper's horse,\" and \"was it a fine night, and the moon risen?\" Then the\ndrawing-room door opened and closed. No--he was not gone--not without\nsaying adieu. He would surely pay his wife that deference. Outside the\nwall she heard his foot ascending the staircase, slowly, with heavy\npauses between each step. She crept close to the farther door--behind\nthe curtain, and listened.\n\n\"Agatha--where is she gone to?\" said Mary, peeping carelessly into the\ndark room.\n\n\"Oh, she has followed her husband up-stairs, of course. Think of all the\ncharges and farewells--the kissing and the crying. 'Tis a wonder she\ndid not insist on riding with him across the country, and coming back at\nmidnight, as I suppose Nathanael will do. La? what's to become of these\nvery devoted husbands and wives.\"\n\nAgatha crushed her hands against the wall She felt as if she could\nalmost have torn Eulalie's heart out--if she had a heart. While in her\nown bosom, leaping up in all its strength, ready at once for heroism,\nlove, and fury--for any nobleness or any crime--was that fountain of\nall her sex's actions, that mainspring of all her life--the fatal\nwoman-heart.\n\nShe waited until she heard Nathanael descend the stairs, and then, as\nhe passed into the drawing-room to his sisters, she, by the little\ncurtained door, passed out into the hall. There she remained until the\nrest came; the sisters trooping after Nathanael, and the old Squire\nfollowing likewise, to see that his son had the best and steadiest horse\nfor a night-ride, which ride, he took care to observe, pointedly, was a\nmost uncourteous proceeding, and warranted by nothing, save the fact of\nits being performed on the especial service of Anne Valery.\n\n\"Agatha--where is Agatha hiding herself?\" said Mary. \"She ought not to\nkeep her husband waiting a minute.''\n\n\"Oh, no?\" And the little figure, all in white, glided out from some\nqueer corner of the hall, and stood like a ghost in the moonlight.\n\"Good night--good night.\" She threw out her hand with those of the\nothers--threw it--not gave it.\n\nNathanael took the hand, but did not say good night--indeed he never\nspoke at all.\n\n\"Well, are you not going to embrace one another, stage-fashion? Don't\nlet Mary and me interrupt you, pray.\" And the two Miss Harpers drew back\na little from the young couple.\n\nMr. Harper bent coldly over his wife's brow, hid under the shadow of her\nheavy hair.\n\n\"No, no; not that,\" Agatha whispered, recoiling from his touch. \"Never\nthat again.\"\n\nHe opened the hall-door--saying adieu to neither father nor\nsisters--leaped on his horse, and was gone.\n\n\"Agatha, Agatha; where are you running? He is far down the road by this\ntime. Come in, do! Are you so very reluctant to be left for a few hours\nalone?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! Oh, no!\" And Agatha went back to the drawing-room with her\nsisters-in-law.\n\nAlone! The word she had repudiated rose up like a spirit, everywhere,\nall over the house. Not a room but what seemed empty, strange. Fast and\nbusily the Miss Harpers talked--yet all around was, oh! such silence.\nThe silence that we feel in a house when some voice and step has gone\nout of it, which no one misses except we, and which we miss as we should\nmiss the daylight or the sun.\n\nWhen all grew quiet, and Agatha sat in her own room--expecting nothing,\nfor she knew he would not come--but still sitting, with her hair falling\ndamp about her, and her eyes fixed on the mirror for company, yet\nhalf growing frightened as if it were a strange object on which she\ngazed--then, indeed, there was silence--then, indeed, she was _alone_.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nMr. Harper did not ride home by midnight, as his wife was well assured\nhe would not do, though with some idle hope put into her mind by\nEulalie, she sat at the window until the stars whitened in the dawn.\n\nAt noon--which seemed to come slowly, every hour a day--Mr. Dugdale\nappeared with a message, which by some wondrous good fortune he\nremembered to deliver--that Nathanael had returned from Weymouth to\nKingcombe, and was waiting there. Agatha gathered with difficulty that\nher husband wished her to return with Mr. Dugdale.\n\n\"I will not go.\"\n\n\"That's right! I wouldn't do it upon any account,\" said Eulalie, with\nnot the kindest of laughs. \"I wouldn't be sent for like a school-girl.\nLet Nathanael come himself and fetch you. What a rude fellow he is!\"\n\n\"Eulalie!--You forget you are speaking of your brother and my husband. I\nwill be ready in five minutes, Mr. Dugdale.\"\n\nDuke lifted his placid but observant eyes, and smiled. \"That's good.\nCome along, my child.\"\n\nHe had never spoken so kindly to her before. It was as if he read her\ntrouble. Her anger faded--she was near bursting in tears. In a little\nwhile she had taken the good man's arm--which Eulalie pointedly informed\nher was not the fashion at Kingcombe--and was walking with him to meet\nher husband.\n\nMarmaduke talked but little; marching on leisurely in a meditative mood,\nand leaving his young sister-in-law to follow his example. Once or twice\nshe felt stealing down upon her one of his kindly, paternal glances,\nand heard him saying to himself his usual winding-up of every mental\ndifficulty:\n\n\"Eh!--We know nothing! Nobody knows anything. But everything always\ncomes clear sometime.\"\n\nAt the verge of the town, apparently coming to meet them, she saw\nNathanael--saw him a long way off. Her heart leaped at the first vision\nof the tall slender figure and light hair; but when he approached she\nwas walking steadfastly along. Her eyes lowered, and her mouth firm set.\nHe came up, silently gave her his arm, and she took it as silently.\n\nMr. Dugdale and her husband immediately began to talk, so there was no\nneed for Agatha to do anything but walk on, trying to remember where she\nwas, and what course of conduct she had to pursue; trying above all to\nrepress these alternate storms of anger and lulls of despair, and deport\nherself not like a passionate child, but a reasonable woman--a woman\nwho, after all, might have been heavily wronged.\n\nSometimes she essayed to consider this--to recall, as is so difficult\nalways, the original cause of difference, the little cloud which had\nproduced this tempest--but everything was in an inextricable maze.\n\nEre long, Nathanael's silence warned her that they two were alone, Mr.\nDugdale having made himself absent, and being seen afar off, diving into\na knot of market-politicians. Arm-in-arm the husband and wife passed\non through the street. Agatha pulled her veil down, and caught more\nsteadfast hold of her husband's arm--he was her husband, and she would\nmaintain their honour in the world's sight. She felt how many curious\neyes were watching them from windows--how many gossiping tongues would\nbe passing comment on the looks and demeanour of Mr. and Mrs. Locke\nHarper.\n\n\"Shall we go over the house now, or would you like to call for my\nsister?\"\n\n\"No--we will go at once,\" returned Agatha.\n\nSteadfastly--mechanically--the young husband and wife looked over their\nfuture home, which was all but ready for habitation. It was not a mean\nabode now; to Mr. Wilson's furniture had been added various comforts\nand luxuries. Agatha asked no questions--scarcely noticed anything. She\nmerely moved about, trying to sustain her position in the eyes of the\nwork-people that showed her round the house; stopping a minute to speak\nkindly to the servant who was already installed there, and who, dropping\na dozen respectful curtsies, explained that she was the daughter of\n\"Master Nathanael's\" nurse.\n\nEverything seemed arranged for Mrs. Harper's comfort, as by invisible\nhands. She never inquired, or even thought, who was the origin of\nit all. She could not believe she was in her own home;--her married\nhome;--she felt as if each minute she should wake and find herself\nAgatha Bowen, in the old rooms in Bedford Square, with all things else a\ndream.\n\n\"Oh, that it were,\" she sighed within herself. \"Oh that I had never\"--\n\nShe paused here--she could not wish that she had never seen Nathanael.\n\nThey quitted the cottage and went out into the street, for country\nand town blended together in tiny Kingcombe. Mr. Harper closed the\nwicket-gate, and looked back upon the little house. There was an unquiet\nglitter in his eye, and his chest heaved violently for a few moments.\nThen, with all outward observance, he linked his wife's arm in his, and\nthey proceeded onwards.\n\nAt the end of East Street they met Harriet Dugdale--the Dugdales seemed\nalways wandering about Kingcombe after one another, and turning up at\nintervals at odd corners.\n\n\"Here you both are! I was looking for my husband. Has anybody seen Duke.\nOh, where on earth is Duke gone to? He said he would be back in five\nminutes--which means five hours.\"\n\n\"I left him at the market-place.\"\n\n\"That's an hour ago. He has been home two or three times since then. Do\nyou think he could get on for a whole hour without wanting the Missus?\nOh, there he is. Stop, and I'll catch him.\"\n\nHe was caught, and led forward prisoner by his pretty wife, who never\nonce let him go, lest he should slide away again, and become absorbed in\nthe mysterious electioneering groups that haunted the town.\n\n\"Now--Harrie--Missus, just wait--I'll be back in a minute.\"\n\n\"Not a minute! Anne has sent word that she wants you directly--you and\nNathanael. You'll go, brother!\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To Thornhurst, to meet Mr. Trenchard and some other folk. You must\nstart immediately.\"\n\nMr. Harper glanced towards his wife, who had dropped his arm; not\npointedly, but as though release were welcome.\n\n\"What, couldn't it leave its pet again?\" cried Harrie, laughing. \"Bless\nit, nobody demands that terrible sacrifice. Do you think Anne would\ninvite husbands without their wives? We are all to go--if you agree,\nAgatha.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" It was quite indifferent to her where she went, or what she\ndid.\n\nSo they all four started in one of those inimitable conveyances called\ndog-carts, which seem to offer every facility for \"accidental death,\"\neither by flying over the horse's head, tumbling under the wheels, or\nslipping off behind.\n\n\"Where will you sit, my dear? Beside your husband, I suppose? Mine\ndrives.\"\n\nAgatha answered by springing up beside Mr. Dugdale, with some vague jest\nabout husbands being no company at all. The dark fit had passed, and she\nwas now in a mood of desperation.\n\nThey dashed on quickly; Marmaduke was a daring driver.\n\nSometimes Agatha even thought he would overturn them in the road. Little\nshe cared! She was in that state of excitement when the utmost peril\nwould only have made her laugh. Passing under the three hills, and\nlooking up at the old castle, silent and grey, the daylight shining\nthrough the fissured apertures that had been windows, she turned round\nand recklessly proposed to Harrie their scrambling up the green slope\nand rolling down again.\n\n\"E--h, my child!\" said Duke Dugdale, turning his mild benevolent looks\non the flushed face beside him. \"Don't'ee try that, don't'ee, now! When\npeople once set themselves rolling down-hill they never stop till they\nget to the bottom. It's always so in this world.\"\n\nAgatha laughed more loudly. She wished her husband to hear how merry she\nwas. She talked incessantly to Mr. Dugdale or Harrie, and held herself\nvery upright, so that Nathanael, who sat behind her, might not\neven feel the touch of her shoulder. She, who had hitherto been so\nindifferent to everybody, so mild in her likings and dislikes--never\ntill now had she felt such strange emotions. Yet each and all carried\nwith them a fierce charm. It was like a person learning for the first\ntime what thirst was, and drinking fire, because, in any case, he must\ndrink. And with all her wrath there seemed a spell over heart, brain,\nand senses, which never for a moment allowed her to cease thinking\nof her husband. Every movement he made, every word he uttered, she\ndistinctly felt and heard.\n\nThe way grew unfamiliar; they were passing through a track of country,\nwilder, and more peculiar than any Mrs. Harper had yet seen in\nDorsetshire--a road cut through furzy eminences, looking down on deep,\nabrupt valleys, that might have been the bed of dried-up lakes or bays;\nlong heathery sweeps of undulating ground, with great stones lying here\nand there; cultivation altogether ceasing--even sheep becoming rare; and\never when they chanced to rise on higher ground, a sharp, salt, sea-wind\nblowing, not a human being to be seen for miles.\n\n\"Here's the gate. I'll open it. Now we get into Anne Valery's property,\"\nsaid Harrie, as she leaped down and leaped up again, mocking Nathanael's\n\"brown study.\"\n\n\"What a change!\" Agatha cried. \"I have not seen such trees in\nDorsetshire.\"\n\n\"They seem indeed to have grown on purpose for Anne. Her grandfather\nbuilt Thornhurst. A queer desolate spot to choose, but it's a perfect\nlittle nest of beauty. There!\"\n\nThe road opened upon a semicircular green plane, levelled among the\nhills, as it were on purpose, and planted round with a sheltering\nbulwark of trees--lime, chestnut, oak--rising higher and higher, until\nat the summit, where the sea-breeze caught them, grew nothing but the\nperpetual Dorsetshire fir. On the edge of the semicircle stood the\nhouse, this green plane before it, behind, a wide stretch of country,\nwhere the tide, running for miles inland, made strange-shaped lakes and\nbroad rivers, spread out glistening in the afternoon sun.\n\n\"Anne, must always be near the sea. I don't think she would live even\nhere unless she knew that just climbing those rocks would bring her in\nsight of the Channel. She has quite an ocean-mania.\"\n\n\"I'll learn it from her. I want a convenient little mania. Suppose I\ncure myself of my old grudge against the sea, and go from hatred into\nlove, or from love back again into hatred--as people do.\"\n\n\"What a comical girl you are!\"\n\n\"Very. Stay now. Wait till the horse is quiet, and I'll take a leap\ndown--just like a person leaping into\"--\n\n\"Hold, Agatha\"--and she felt her arm caught by her husband. It was the\nfirst time he had touched or addressed her since they left Kingcombe.\n\"Don't spring down--it is not safe. Stay till I lift you.\"\n\n\"I do not want your help.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, you do; you are not used to this sort of carriage.'\n\n\"Stand aside--I _will_ jump down,\" she cried, roused by the contest,\nslight as it was, but enough to show the clashing of the two wills.\n\"Stand aside,\" she repeated, leaning forward with glittering eyes,\ngiddy, and in so great confusion of mind as to be in real danger--\"we\nwill see who gives way.\"\n\n\"Are you in earnest?\" Nathanael whispered.\n\n\"Quite. Go!\"\n\n\"I would go if it were play. But when I see my wife about to do any\nfrantic thing to her own injury, I shall restrain her--thus.\"\n\nBalancing himself on the carriage-step, he clasped the little figure in\nhis arms--tight--strangely tight and close. Before Agatha could resist,\nhe had lifted her safely down, and set her free.\n\nShe stood passive--astonished. What could it be in that firm will, in\nthat sudden clasp, which made her feel--was it anger? No not anger,\nthough her cheeks glowed and her breast heaved. Why was it, that as\nNathanael walked onward towards the house, his wife looked after him\nwith such a mingling of attraction and repulsion? What could it be, this\nstrange power which gave him the preeminence over her--which taught her,\nwithout her knowing it, the mystery that causes man to rule and woman\nto obey; Very thoughtful--even unmoved by Harrie's loud laughter at\nthe \"excellent joke\"--Mrs. Harper suffered herself to be led on by her\nsister-in-law.\n\n\"Nonsense, child, don't look so serious. Men will have their\nway--especially husbands. Mine gets obeyed as little as any one; but now\nand then, when it comes to the point\"--here Harrie looked astonishingly\ngrave, for her--\"I'm obliged to give in to Pa; and somehow Pa's always\nright, bless him!\"\n\nHow every word of one happy wife went like a dagger into the other\nwife's heart! But there was no shield. Here they were in Anne Valery's\nhouse, obliged to appear as cheerful guests, especially the newest\nguest, the bride. Agatha tried, and tried successfully, to play her\npart:--misery makes such capital hypocrites!\n\n\"Isn't this a large house for a single woman?\" said Mrs. Dugdale, as the\ntwo ladies passed up-stairs. \"Yet Anne constantly manages to fill it,\nespecially in summer-time. The dozens of sick friends she has staying\nhere to be cured by sea-breezes! the scores of young people that come\nand make love in those green alleys down the garden! But then in the\nlulls of company the house is dull and silent--as now.\"\n\nIt was very silent, though not with the desolation which often broods\nover a large house thinly inhabited. The room--Anne's bedroom--lay\nwestward, and a good deal of sunshine was still glinting in. A few late\nbees were buzzing about the open window, cheated perhaps by the feathery\nseeds of the clematis, which had long ceased flowering. There was no\nother sound. But many fine prints, a few painted portraits, and several\nwhite-gleaming statuettes, seemed as the sunlight struck them to burst\nthe silence, with mute speech.\n\n\"Oh, you are looking at Anne's 'odds and ends' as I call them. Rather a\ncontrast, her walls and ours. I don't see the use of prints and plaster\nimages--always in the way where there are children. But Anne is so\ndreadfully fond of pretty things. She says they're company. No wonder! A\nsolitary old maid must find herself very dull at times.\"\n\n\"Must she?--then she is the more glad to see her visitors\"--a pleasant\nvoice, a silken-rustling step, which in Agatha's fancy seemed always to\nenter like daylight into a dusky room--and Miss Valery came to welcome\nher guests.\n\nShe addressed Mrs. Harper first, and then Harrie, who looked confused\nfor the moment. But it was not a trifle that could upset the equanimity\nof the honest-speaking Harrie Dugdale.\n\n\"Bless us, Anne, how softly you walk!' Listeners,' etc.--You know the\nsaying! But you might listen at every door in Dorsetshire, and never\nhear worse of yourself than I said just now.\"\n\n\"Thank you. When I want a good character I shall be sure to come to\nHarriet Dugdale.--And now, what is the news with the little wife! whom I\nhave yet to bid welcome to Thornhurst. Welcome Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\nAnne said the name, as she often did, with a peculiar under-tone of\nhesitation and tenderness; then, according to her frequent habit, she\nput her hand on her favourite's shoulder, and began to play with the\nbrown curls. \"Have you been quite well and happy since I saw you?\"\n\nThe question, so simple, so full of kindness, pierced Agatha's soul.\nAlas? how much had happened since she sat on the stone seat at Corfe\nCastle, and looked over the view with Anne Valery! How little did Anne\nor any one know that she was wretched--maddened--hating herself and the\nwhole world--believing in nothing good, nothing holy--not even in her\nwho spoke. The words, the smile, appeared the mocking hypocrisy of one\nwho had persuaded her to marry, and must ere long know of that hasty\nmarriage the miserable result This thought steeled her heart even\nagainst Anne Valery.\n\nShe burst into a sharp laugh. \"Well! Happy! Cannot you see? You are the\nbest person to answer your own question.\" And she moved away out of the\nroom.\n\nAnne looked after her, thoughtfully, rather sadly. Perhaps she was used\nto have her pets glide from her, dancing out indifferently into the\nmerry world. She made no attempt to follow Agatha, but led the way\ndown-stairs into the drawing-room.\n\n\"Mr. Trenchard, come and let me introduce you to Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\n\nAs Miss Valery said this, an elderly gentleman, dapper, dandy, and\nsmall, escaped from under the hands of Duke Dugdale--those big earnest\nhands that were laid upon him in all the apostleship of sincere\nargument--and came, nothing loth, as his eager bow showed, to do the\npolite to the young bride who had been lately brought to the county.\nFor Mr. Trenchard, besides the wondrously sweetening power of his\ncandidateship, came of a very ancient name in Dorsetshire. He was\nevidently a beau too--one of those harmless general adorers whom the\ninfluence of a graceful woman touches even unto old age.\n\nAgatha saw in his first look that he admired her, and she was in\nthat proud desperate mood when a girl is ready to catch hold of the\nattentions or conversation of any one--even an elderly gentleman. She\nwas very gracious to Mr. Trenchard--nay, altogether bewitching--though\nfor the first ten minutes she herself saw and heard nothing save a thing\nin black with white hair, talking to her of the beauties of Dorsetshire.\nMore distinctly than aught he said, she heard what was passing in the\ngroup at the other end of the room--especially her husband's voice,\nso quiet and deep, always a tone deeper than any other voices, falling\nthrough all the rest like a note of music. And she soon found out that\nAnne was listening also--to Nathanael, of course. She always did.\n\nMr. Trenchard followed the direction of the two ladies' eyes, and\ningeniously took up the text.\n\n\"I assure you, Mrs. Harper, it is a pleasure to all the neighbourhood\nthat your husband has come back from America. I remember him quite a\nchild, and his uncle a young man. And really, how like he is, in both\nfeature and voice, to what his uncle used to be at that time. As he\nstands there talking, I could almost fancy it was Mr. Locke Harper.\"\n\n\"Mr. Locke Harper,\" repeated Agatha. \"Was that the name Uncle Brian went\nby?\"\n\n\"Yes, save with those privileged people who called him Brian. But they\nwere few. He had not the fortune or misfortune of possessing a thousand\nand one intimate friends. Yet all respected him, and remember him still.\nIt will be a real satisfaction to have in the country a second Mr. Locke\nHarper,--Dear me, how like he is! Don't you see it, Miss Valery?\"\n\n\"There is a general likeness running through all the Harper family.\"\n\n\"Except the eldest son, though even to him I can trace some resemblance\nhere\"--and he bowed to Mrs. Dugdale. \"And this reminds me that I knew\nbeforehand I should probably have the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Harper in\nDorsetshire. Only two days ago I saw at Paris Major Frederick Harper.\"\n\n\"Is Major Harper at Paris?\" eagerly cried Agatha, caught by the name,\nwhich had so soon passed out of the daily interests of her life,\nthat its sound was already quite strange. It reached her now like a\ncomforting breath of old times--a something to catch hold of in the\nwide, dreary maze around her. Her former guardian seemed to rise up\nbefore her; with all his cheery, good-natured ways; his compassion\nwhen she had been newly made an orphan; his kindness of manner that\nremained--ay, to the very last.\n\nIn a rush of many feelings that softened her voice to positive\ntenderness, she cried, \"Oh do tell me all about Major Harper?\"\n\nAnd this time she did not notice that, in the political discussion going\nforward, it was Mr. Dugdale who spoke, his brother-in-law having ceased\nthe argument and become silent.\n\n\"Madam,\" returned the candidate, with a smile--perhaps a little too\nmeaning a smile--\"I will, with pleasure, tell you everything. I guessed\nfrom his anxious questions concerning you, and whether I had met you in\nDorsetshire, that before he was your brother-in-law Major Harper had the\nhappiness of being an intimate friend of yours.\"\n\n\"He was my guardian.\"\n\n\"That fact he did not inform me of. Indeed we had little time for\nconversation. We merely dined together, and parted almost immediately.\nHe seemed in the midst of a whirl of pleasant engagements, as Major\nHarper invariably is. Charming, agreeable man! An immense favourite with\nall ladies.\"\n\nAgatha answered \"Yes\" rather coldly. Her attention was wandering; she\nhad missed the sound of her husband's voice altogether. But the next\nmoment she heard him behind her.\n\n\"Mr. Trenchard?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear sir? Are you also come to ask questions about your\nbrother, whom, as I have been telling Mrs. Harper, I had the pleasure to\nmeet in Paris?\"\n\n\"So I have just heard you say. Where, and how was he living?\"\n\nAgatha thought this a strange question for Nathanael to put to a third\nparty concerning his own brother. She was glad to hear Miss Valery\nobserve, with genuine tact, that Major Harper was always careless in the\nmatter of giving addresses.\n\n\"He was living--let me see--at 102 Rue--, one of the handsomest and\npleasantest streets in Paris. I remember he said he was obliged to take\nthis _appartement_ for three months, after which he was going to act the\nhermit and economise. Very unlikely that, I should think, for a man of\nMajor Harper's social habits.\"\n\n\"Very,\" Agatha said, being looked to for a response. She was much\nsurprised to learn this of her brother-in-law; still more did she wonder\nat the rigid silence with which her husband heard the same.\n\n\"I think, Mrs. Harper, we may safely say that his determination will not\nlast. A mere fit of misanthropy after rather too much gaiety. In such\na pleasant fellow as Frederick Harper we must excuse a few broken\nresolutions.\"\n\n\"We ought,\" said Anne Valery, with that rare gentleness which makes men\nlisten to a woman even when she \"preaches.\" \"It is a very hard trial for\nany one to be thrown into the world with so many gifts as Major Harper.\nA man whom all men like, and not a few women are prone to love, goes\nthrough an ordeal so fierce, that if he withstand it he is one of the\ngreatest heroes on earth. If he fall\"--and Anne lowered her voice so\nthat Agatha could scarcely hear, though she felt sure Nathanael did--\"if\nhe fall, we ought, through all the wrong, clearly to discern the\ntemptation.\"\n\nIt was a new doctrine, the last Agatha would have expected to hear on\nthe lips of such a sternly good woman as she had painted Miss Valery.\nShe said so, adding, with her usual plainness, \"I thought, somehow, that\nyou did not like Major Harper?\"\n\n\"Nay, we were young together. But hush, my dear, your husband is\nspeaking.\"\n\nHe was saying, with quite an altered expression, something about \"my\nbrother Frederick.\" But after that mention Major Harper's name died out\nof the conversation, as out of Agatha's memory. Alas, not the unfrequent\nfate of the Major Harpers of society--meteors, never thought of but\nwhile they are shining, and forgotten as soon as they have burnt\nthemselves out.\n\nBy this time the two or three stray visitors--gentlemen-farmers, Anne's\ntenants, as Mrs. Dugdale whispered--had disappeared, and Mr. Trenchard\nwas the sole stranger left in the drawing-room. Miss Valery did the\nhonours of her house with a remarkably simple grace.\n\n\"I give no state dinner parties,\" she said, smiling, to Mr. Trenchard.\n\"It is a whim of mine that I never could see the use of friends meeting\ntogether merely to eat and drink, or of offering them more and richer\nfare than is customary or necessary. But if you will stay and dine with\nme, and with these my own people, country fashion, even though you have\nbeen a ten years' resident in London\"--\n\n\"But have never forgotten Dorset, and good Dorset ways,\" said the old\ngentleman, as he bowed over the hostess's hand. Then, obeying Anne's\nsignal, he offered his arm to Mrs. Harper to lead her in to dinner;--the\ninnocent daylight dinner, with real China-roses looking in at the\nwindow, and an energetic autumn-robin singing his good-night before the\nsun went down.\n\nAgatha could have been happy, merry--she was still so young, and\nthe weight on her heart was the first that ever had fallen there. At\nintervals she struggled to forget it--almost succeeded; and then the\nfirst glimpse of her husband's face, the first tone of his voice,\nbrought the burden back again. Her spirits grew wilder than ever, lest\nany one should guess she was so very, very miserable.\n\nAfter dinner, dreading Anne's eyes, she rushed off into the garden with\nHarrie Dugdale; tossing back her hair, and inhaling by gasps the cold\nevening wind, that it might bring calm and clearness to her brain. Even\nyet she felt as though she were dreaming.\n\nReturning, she found lights in the drawing-room. Mr. Trenchard, in a\npatient attitude, was listening to Marmaduke Dugdale; some distance\noff, Nathanael sat talking to Miss Valery. Anne was leaning back in an\narm-chair: the lamp shining full on her face showed how very pale and\nworn it was. Her voice, too, sounded feeble, as Agatha caught the words:\n\n\"In two months, you think? That is a long time.\"\n\n\"It cannot be sooner, Marmaduke says. I met him on board the ship\nat Weymouth; when he told me of this innocent little scheme he was\ntransacting.\"\n\n\"But you will not tell\"--\n\n\"Uncle Brian? No, of course not. Yet I think it would do Uncle Brian\ngood to know how dearly Marmaduke and all his friends here care for him.\nYet he might not believe it--I think he never did.\"\n\nAnne was silent.\n\n\"He used to say,\" continued Nathanael, who was sitting where he\ncould not see his wife, and for once heard not her soft step over the\ncarpet--\"Uncle Brian used to say, that it was wisest neither to love\nnor need love. I think different. It is a cruel, hardening, embittering\nthing for a man to feel that no one loves him.\"\n\n--\"Love--love! Have you two sage ones been discussing that folly? Now,\nmay I have the honour to hear?\"\n\n\"If Anne will talk; I have done speaking,\" said Mr. Harper, as he gave\nAgatha his chair, and slowly moved away to the other circle.\n\nThus, ever thus, he went from her, escaping the chance of either being\nwounded or healed. Agatha was nearly wild. With all her might she flung\nherself into conversation with Mr. Trenchard, and tried to conjugate\nthat verb--hitherto a mystery to her innocent mind--_to flirt_. She\nwished to make herself beautifully hateful--bewitchingly foul; or rather\nshe did not care what she made herself, if she only made _him_--who had\nnow in her thoughts sank to the namelessness, which proves that one name\nis fast filling up the whole world--made him stir from that mountain\nheight of impassive calm--melted him into repentance--shook him into\nfrenzied jealousy. Anything--anything--so that he no longer should stand\nbefore her like a serene Alp, which nothing human could disturb, and\nwhich--ah, in all her madness, she saw that but too clearly!--which\nhad always such a heavenly light shining on its forehead--a purity\n\"God-given,\" like his name.\n\nHis name, which she had once so disliked, but which now caught a strange\nbeauty. Lately, she had looked out its meaning in a list of Bible names;\nand many a time, the night before, she had said it to herself, crying\nit out into the dark, until its soft Hebrew vowels grew musical, and its\nholy Hebrew meaning grew divine. \"Nathanael--Nathanael--_God-given_.\"\nMight he not indeed be a husband given unto her of God--to lead her in\nthe right way, and make a true noble woman of her; such as a woman is\nalways made by the love of, and the loving of, a noble man.\n\nBut these were sacred night-time thoughts which vanished in the\ndaylight, or only came in snatches and rifts, careering through the\nblackness that surrounded her.\n\nAnd still she talked to the fortunate Mr. Trenchard; made herself more\nagreeable than she had ever believed possible. The elderly beau was\nfascinated, and even Mr. Dugdale turned from election-papers, to look at\nhis fair sister-in-law with genuine admiration--now and then nodding to\nHarrie, as if to see what she thought of this new light that had shot\nacross their country hemisphere. At which Mrs. Dugdale once or\ntwice pretended to be mightily jealous, until her husband, with his\ninconceivable sweet smile, his way of patting her knees with his big\ngentle hand, and the utterly inexpressible tone of his \"Nay, now Missus\"\nmade matters quite straight, and plunged back into his politics.\n\nAll this while Anne Valery sat in her arm chair--speaking little,\nlooking from one to the other of her guests with a wandering, thoughtful\neye, that, for once, noticed little the things around her, because her\nmental vision was afar off.--Whither--\n\nAnd Marmaduke went on with his benevolent schemes for improving\nDorsetshire and the world; and his Harrie had her dreams too--possibly\nabout the advantage an M.P.'s interest might prove in future days to\n\"the children;\" and the young couple, in all the whirl of their misery,\nstill clung to hope and youth and life, so little of which way they had\ntrod, and so much of which lay before them. No one thought of her who\nsat apart, looking smilingly on them all, but to whom they and the\nthings surrounding them were day by day growing more dim--who was\nfading, fading, even while she smiled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nWhen, late at night, the party reached Kingcombe, it was resolved that\nthe Harpers should remain there until morning. Agatha, worn out with\nbodily fatigue and the great tension of her mind during so many hours,\nlaid her head down on her pillow, closed her aching eyes, and never\nopened them till near upon broad noon. Then she found breakfast was long\nover in the early house of the Dugdales, and that Nathanael had left her\nand gone out some hours before.\n\n\"He would not let me come and wake you--he said you slept so heavily\nand looked so tired. Certainly, he is the very kindest husband! Who ever\nwould have believed that stiff, cold disagreeable Nathanael, who came\nhome from America some months ago, puzzling us all, would have turned\nout so well. It is your ladyship's doing, I suppose.\"\n\nSo ran on Mrs. Dugdale, nor noticed how beneath her words her\nsister-in-law writhed, as though they had been sharp swords. Harrie was\nnot a penetrating woman; Agatha had already discerned that, and thought,\nwith a bitter smile, that it was well they were coming to live at\nKingcombe, and that Mrs. Dugdale would be a very safe and amusing\ncompanion.\n\n\"Now, what is to be done to-day?\" said she, as she ate the breakfast\nwhich Harrie brought her, and looked round the strange bed-room, which\nmade her feel more bewildered than ever. So many phases, so many lives\ndid she seem to have passed through since she was married.\n\n\"The first thing to be done, my dear, is to take you back to Kingcombe\nHolm, to do respectful to your papa-in-law. Very punctilious is the\nSquire. If Nathanael had not ridden over there at some unearthly hour\nthis morning, he never would have forgiven your not returning at\nnight--the last night too, for I see your husband is determined to be\nsettled at the cottage this evening.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is well.\" Agatha breathed more freely. She was so glad to hide\nherself under any roof that was her own. And perhaps a vague thought\ncrept up, that some time--not for days yet, but when she could bend her\npride to soften him--when they were living quite alone together--all\nmight be gradually explained, nay, healed, between her and her husband.\nShe was on the whole not sorry to go \"home.\"\n\n\"I see you two are quite agreed,\" laughed Harrie. \"Marvellous union,\nMrs. Locke Harper. You'll be really a pattern couple soon, and throw\nDuke and me cruelly in the shade. Now, dress like lightning, and I'll\ndrive you and the children over to grandpapa's. Most likely well meet Pa\nand Nathanael somewhere about the town.\"\n\nBut, with the general vagueness of the Dugdale habits, that meeting did\nnot arrive, nor was Mr. Harper anywhere to be seen.\n\n\"I dare say he is at the cottage, where I was bid not to take you upon\nany account. Charming little mysteries, I suppose, attendant on bringing\nhome the bride. Very nice. Heigh-ho! I remember how happy I was when my\npoor dear Duke brought me home for the first time!\"\n\n\"Where was that?\" They were dashing over the moors, Agatha sitting\nrather silent, and Harrie's tongue galloping as fast as Dunce, her\nsteed. Little Brian was perched on his mother's knee, holding the\nreins--a baby Phaeton, though with small danger of setting the world on\nfire--at least just yet.\n\n\"Where was it, my dear? Why, to the same old house we live in, empty\nand gloomy then, though it's full enough now. And I had been\nmarried--(hold your tongues, Fred and Gus! you can't have the whip,\nsimpletons!)--married only three weeks, and it was queer coming back to\nmy native place; and my father was rather cross that I had married Duke\nat all, and--I was foolish enough to cry.\"\n\nHere Harrie laughed, and gave Dunce a lash that quite discomposed his\npony faculties, and made Brian scream with delight.\n\n\"And what did your husband say?\"\n\n\"Say? Nothing. He never speaks when he's vexed or hurt; only, a little\nwhile afterwards he came beside me, and said something about my being\nsuch a young girl, so gay-hearted and pretty--(bah!--though I was pretty\nthen)--too young, he said, to marry such an elderly man, etc. etc. etc.\"\n\n\"And what did _you_ say?\"\n\n\"Likewise nothing. I just jumped on his knee, and took him round the\nneck, and--But that isn't of the slightest consequence to anybody. Tuts!\nOn with you, Dunce!\" And Harrie leaned forward, her eyelashes glittering\nwet in spite of her fun.\n\n\"I know I don't deserve him,\" she continued. \"I never did. Nobody could.\nThere are a lot of bad men in the world, but when a man is really good,\nthere's hardly a woman alive that is good enough for him. And I'm not\nhalf good enough for Duke--but--I love him! That's all. Bless thee,\nBrian! thee is Pa's own boy all over!\"\n\nAnd Harrie kissed the little fellow passionately, with something more\neven than a mother's love.--Agatha could have lifted up her arms and\nshrieked with misery.\n\nIt was a strange long day at Kingcombe Holm; many things to be arranged,\nmany questions to be parried, many prying eyes to be avoided. But\nthe general conclusion seemed to be, that this sudden movement was a\nmysterious whim of Nathanael--and Nathanael was supposed by one-half of\nhis family to be mightily prone to mysteries and whims.\n\nAt length, when the day was nigh spent, and Agatha had dressed for the\nlast of those formal dinners to which she had never been able quite to\nreconcile herself, she took refuge in Elizabeth's room. Thither she\nhad of late absented herself; there was something so formidable in the\nkeenness of Elizabeth's silent eyes. Hesitating before the door, she\nremembered when she had last quitted it. It required all her bravery to\ncross the threshold once more.\n\n\"Come in. I hear your foot, Agatha.\" There was no stepping back now.\n\nThe same atmosphere of peace and sanctity pervading the pretty room; the\nsame lights dancing through the painted window on the silk coverlet; the\nsame face, which had all the colourless reality of death, without any\nof its ghastliness--a smiling repose, such as is seen only at the\nbeginning and end of life's tumult--in the cradle and in the coffin. Its\neffect upon Agatha was instantaneous. Her trembling ceased; she stepped\nlightly, as one does in entering a holy place.\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" It seemed a beautiful name, a saint's name, and as such\ncame quite naturally, though she had rarely before been so familiar with\nany one of her new sisters. She kneeled down and kissed Elizabeth.\n\n\"That is right. You are good to come. And where have you been, my little\nsister?--I have not seen you for three days.\"\n\n\"Is it so long?\"\n\n\"Yes--though it may seem longer to me here. You remember you came and\ntold me a long story about a Cornish miner. How did the tale end? What,\nno answer?\"\n\nNone. She tried to hide herself--crush herself into the very floor where\nshe sat, out of reach of Elizabeth's eyes.\n\n\"Ah, well, dear! I shall not ask.\"\n\n\"Perhaps my husband will tell you some day. Talk to me of something\nelse, Elizabeth. And oh! however I may look and speak, don't notice me.\nLet me feel that I need not make pretences with you.\"\n\n\"You need not. Nothing that happens here goes beyond these four walls.\nEverybody tells me everything.\"\n\nElizabeth might well say this. There was that about her which made\npeople fearless and free in their confidence; it did not seem like\ntalking to a mortal woman, mixed up continually in the affairs of life,\nbut to one removed to a different sphere, where there was no chance of\nbetrayal.\n\nHer room was a safe confessional, and she was a sort of general\nconscience in the house.\n\n\"Everybody tells you everything,\" repeated Agatha. \"Does my husband?\"\n\n\"Not yet; at least not in words.\"\n\n\"Then I will not. Only let me come here, and\"--\n\nShe covered her face, and for a few moments wept fully and freely, as\none weep's before one's own heart and before God. Then she dried her\neyes, and the storm was over.\n\nElizabeth only said, \"Poor child--poor child. Wait!\" But the one word\nstruck like a sun-ray through darkness. No one ever \"waited\" but had\nsome hopeful ending to wait for.\n\n\"Now,\" said Agatha, overcoming her weakness--\"now let us talk. What have\nyou been doing all day?\"\n\n\"Little else than read this, and think over it. You know Frederick's\nhand, I see? He does not usually write such long letters, even to me.\nAll is not right with him, I fear.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"--and Agatha met unsuspiciously the keen look of Elizabeth.\n\"Yet he is well and in the midst of gaieties; Mr. Trenchard said so\nyesterday. They met in Paris.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" Elizabeth lay musing for a good while; then suddenly said,\nobserving her young sister, \"Agatha, you are listening? There's some one\nat the door?\"\n\nIt was Nathanael. Any one might have known that by the quick flush\nthat swept over his wife's features. But when this passed she was again\ncomposed--not at all like the young creature who had wept by Elizabeth's\ncouch. She merely acknowledged her husband's presence, and leaving her\nplace vacant for him, took up a book.\n\nHe said, \"I did not know my wife was here. Were you and she talking?\nShall I leave you?\"\n\nElizabeth smiled. \"Then you must take your wife also, for I will not be\nthe sundering of married people. But nonsense! Sit down both of you. We\nwere speaking about Frederick. Has he written to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In this letter\"--Nathanael's eyes fell on it and froze there--\"he\ngives me no address. Agatha says he is living in Paris. Do you remember\nwhere?\"\n\n\"I do not.\",\n\n\"Perhaps your wife does.\"\n\nAgatha had a useful memory for such things. She repeated the address\ngiven by Mr. Trenchard, exactly.\n\n\"Good child! When I write I shall tell Frederick how you remembered\nhim. But he has been equally mindful of you. He asks many questions, and\nseems very anxious about you.\"\n\n\"Does he? He is very kind,\" said Agatha, somewhat moved. She felt all\nkindness deeply now.\n\n\"He is kind,\" Miss Harper continued, thoughtfully. \"When he was a\nboy, there never was a softer heart. Poor Frederick!\" And the name was\nuttered with a fondness that Agatha had never noticed in any other of\nMajor Harper's family towards him. It led her to look sympathisingly\ntowards Elizabeth.\n\n\"Are you uneasy about him? Oh! I do hope nothing is wrong with poor\nMajor Harper.\" And she almost forgot her own feelings in thinking\nhow unbrotherly it was of Nathanael to sit there like a stone, saying\nnothing. Elizabeth also seemed hurt; the elder brother was clearly her\nfavourite--clung to as sisters cling, through good report and evil. She\nlooked gratefully at Agatha.\n\n\"Thank you. You are a warm-hearted girl. But you ought to keep a warm\nheart for Frederick. You do not know how tenderly he always speaks of\nyou.\"\n\nAgatha coloured, she hardly knew why, except because she saw her husband\nstart and look at her--one of those keen, quick looks that only last a\nmoment. Under it she blushed still deeper--to very scarlet.\n\nMr. Harper stood up. \"I think, Elizabeth, we must go now. Agatha shall\ncome to you again in a day or two--and you and she can then talk over\nboth your sisterly loves for Frederick.\"\n\nHe spoke lightly, but Agatha heard a jarring tone--she was growing so\nfamiliar with his every tone now. Why did he thus speak, thus look,\nwhenever she uttered or listened to his brother's name? Could it be\npossible that Emma had told him--No, she threw that thought from her in\nscorn--the scorn with which she had once met the insinuation that\nshe had been \"in love\" with Major Harper. Emma could not have been so\nfoolish, so wicked, or, if she had, any manly honour, any honest pride,\nwould have made Nathanael speak of it before their marriage. Since, she\nfelt certain that Mr. Harper had not interchanged a single word alone\nwith Mrs. Thornycroft.\n\nIn disgust and shame that her vanity--oh! not vanity, but a feeling\nthat, holy as it was, her proud heart still denied--had led her to\nform the suspicion, Agatha cast it from her. She who had no secrets, no\njealousies, felt it to be impossible that Nathanael should bury within\nhis breast that foul thing--a secret jealousy of his brother.\n\nEspecially now, when it seemed as if his love itself were dying or\ndead--when on quitting Elizabeth's room, he walked with her, silent, or\nmaking smooth brief speeches, as he would to any other lady--any lady he\nhad met for the first time, and was handing courteously down to dinner.\nHer heart boiled within her! Was she to pour it out before him in\ncomplaint--repentance? Was she to accuse him of jealousy, and be met\nwith a calm contemptuous smile?--to betray the growing passion of her\nheart, in order to light up the few stray embers that might yet be\nlingering feebly in his? Never! She walked on haughtily, carelessly,\ndumb.\n\nThe evening slid on, hardly noticed by her. Night came; when, after\nmany ceremonious family adieux, which she responded to without ever\nhearing--after one frantic rush along the dim passages to Elizabeth's\ndoor, where she drew back and left the tearful good-bye unspoken, for\n_he_ was standing there--after all this the Squire put her into the\nfamily coach, with Mrs. Dugdale at her side and Nathanael opposite.\nBidding her farewell, the old man gave, with less stateliness than\ntenderness, his fatherly blessing upon her and her new home. They\nreached it. Again she laid her head upon a strange pillow in a strange\nroom, and slept, as she always did when very wretched, the heavy,\nstupifying sleep which lasts from night till morning--deadening all\ncare, but making the waking like that of one waking in a tomb.\n\nAgatha woke with the sunshine full in her eyes, and the early\nchurch-bells ringing.\n\n\"Oh, where am I? What day is this? Where is my husband?\"\n\nThe new maid, Nathanael's foster-sister, was standing by, smiling all\nrespectful civilities, informing her in broad Dorset that it was Sunday,\ntime for \"missus\" to get up, and that \"master\" was walking in the\ngarden.\n\nThey \"mistress\" and \"master,\" head and guide of their own\nhousehold!--they, two young creatures, who so little time ago had been a\nyouth and a girl, each floating adrift on life, without duties or ties.\nIt had seemed very strange, very solemn, under any circumstances, but\nnow--\n\n\"God help me, poor helpless child that I am! Oh, what shall I do?\"\n\nSuch was the inward sob of Agatha's heart. She almost wished that she\ncould have turned her face again on the pillow, and slept there safely\nfor eternity.\n\nBut the matin church-bells ceased--it was nine o'clock. She must rise,\nand appear below for the first time as mistress in her own house. Also,\nshe remembered faintly something which Mrs. Dugdale had said about the\ncustom at Kingcombe--an irrefragable law of country etiquette---of a\nbride's going to church for the first time, ceremoniously, in\nbridal dress. And no sooner had she descended--wrapped in the first\nmorning-frock she could lay her hands upon, than Harrie entered.\n\n\"So--I am your first visitor you see. Many welcomes to your new home!\nAnd may it prove as happy, as merry--and some day, as full--as ours.\nBless you, my dear little sister!\"\n\nShe pressed Agatha in her arms with more feeling than Harrie usually\nshowed. But, for Agatha's salvation, or she would have burst into sobs,\nit was only momentary.\n\n\"Come, no sentiment! Call in Nathanael, and eat your breakfast quickly,\nyou atrociously lazy folks! Don't you know you have only half-an-hour\nand you must go to church, or all Kingcombe would be talking.\"\n\n\"I meant to go--I shall be ready in two minutes.\"\n\n\"My patience! ready--in such a gown! Come here Nathanael. Are you aware\nit's indispensable for your wife to appear at church in wedding costume,\njust as she did on that blissful day, when\"--\n\n\"Hush! I'll do anything you like, only hush!\" whispered Agatha. Harrie\nlaughed, and said something about \"sparing her blushes.\" There were none\nto spare--she was as pale as death. What, appear before her husband,\ndressed as on the morning when if not altogether a happy bride, she at\nleast had the hope of making her bridegroom happy, and the comfort of\nbelieving that he loved her and would love her always! The mere thought\nof this sent a coldness through all her frame.\n\nNathanael said, \"You told me this before, Harriet. It is an idle custom;\nbut neither my wife nor myself would wish to go against the world, or\nthe ways of our own people. Arrange it, as Agatha says, according as you\nlike.\"\n\nHe had then heard her whisper--he had seen her paleness. How had he\ninterpreted both?\n\nThe church-bells began to ring again, and Harrie prepared to vanish,\nthough not until she had dressed Agatha, scanned her from top to toe,\nvowed the bonnet did not become her a bit, and that she looked as\nwhite as if she were again about to go through the formidable\nmarriage-service.\n\n\"A sad pity!--because to-day you'll be looked at a great deal more than\nthe clergyman. We are a terribly inquisitive town; and weddings are\nscarce at Kingcombe.--Take your wife, Nathanael. There you go--a very\nhandsome, interesting young couple. Nay, don't cheat the townsfolk by\ntaking the garden way.\"\n\n\"Do, pray?\" entreated Agatha of her husband. \"Don't let the people see\nus.\"\n\n\"You foolish child!\" cried Harrie, as she made herself invisible through\nthe front-door, throwing back her last words as an unconscious parting\nsting. \"Folks will think you are ashamed of your husband.\"\n\nAgatha took no notice, nor did Nathanael. Silently they walked to\nchurch, the garden way, which led them out opposite the eastern door.\nEntering with his wife on his arm, his bare head erect, though the eyes\nwere lowered, his whole face still and steadfast, but looking much\nolder since his marriage.--Mr. Harper was a man of whom no one need\nbe ashamed. His wife glanced at him, and, in spite of all her sorrow,\nwalked proudly up the aisle--prouder far than on her wedding-day. She\nnever thought of herself or of the people looking at her. And--Heaven\nforgive her, poor child!--for the moment she never thought of Whose\ntemple she was entering, until the clergyman's serious voice arose,\nproclaiming those \"sacrifices\" which are \"a broken spirit.\" Then her\nspirit sank down broken within her, and under her thick white veil, and\nupon her white velvet bridal Prayer-book, fell tears, many and bitter.\nThe poorest charity-girl that stared at her from the gallery would not\nthat day have envied the bride.\n\nService over, out of the church they went as they had come, arm-in-arm;\nthe congregation holding back; all watching, but from some mysterious\netiquette which must be left to the Kingcombeites to elucidate, no one\nventuring to speak to Mr. and Mrs. Locke Harper. The Squire's household\ndid not attend this church, nor the Dugdales either; so that the young\npeople walked home without speaking to a soul, and scarcely to each\nother. They were both very grave. A word, perhaps, from either would\nhave unlocked a heart flood; but the word was not spoken. They met at\nthe gate of the cottage Mrs. Dugdale and her boys. Soon all the solemn\ninfluences of the temple passed away. They were in the world once\nmore--the hard, bitter, erring world.\n\n\"We are come in to see Auntie Agatha and Uncle Nathanael,\" said Harrie,\nas the children stood rather awe-struck by Mrs. Harper's dazzling\nappearance. \"And we are going to take both back with us for dinner, as\nyou promised. Early country dinner, my dear, which can't by any means be\neaten in those fine clothes.\"\n\n\"I will take them off.\" And her foot was on the stairs.\n\n\"Stay; don't you see your husband looking at you. Let me look too--we\nare never likely to see you dressed as a bride again.\"\n\nAgatha paused, but Mr. Harper had already turned away. His gaze--would\nshe had seen it! but she did not--was ended.\n\nShe ran up-stairs, she looked in the glass once more at the vision\nwhich, from the age of childhood, almost every girl beholds herself in\nfancy--the dazzling white silk, orange-flowers, and lace, trappings\nof a day, never to be again worn. Then she tore them off,\nwildly--desperately; wishing one minute that she could bury them in the\nearth out of her sight, and again wrapping them up tenderly, as we wrap\nup clothes that are now nothing but empty garments, from which the form\nthat-filled them has vanished evermore.\n\nAfterwards she dressed herself in ordinary matronly garb, and came down\nwith matronly aspect to Harry and the little boys.\n\nA mid-day country dinner, eaten in peace and quietness, where people\nkeep Sunday in Christian fashion--at least externally--where no visitors\ncome in, and no gay evening reunions put an unholy close to the holy\nday; when the father of the family gathers his children round him in\nthe long, sleepy afternoons, or takes a walk with them in the\nsummer-twilight while all the neighbours are safe in church; after\nwhich, as a great treat, the elder ones sit up to supper, and the little\nones are put to bed by mamma's own hands; then pleasant weariness,\nperhaps some brief evening prayer, sincere without cant--the household\nseparates--the house darkens--and the day of rest ends.\n\nThis was the way they kept Sunday at the Dugdales'. It was something new\nto Agatha, and she liked it much. She threw herself into the domestic\nways as if she had been used to them all her life, and specially made\nherself popular with the father and the little ones. Marmaduke looked\nbenevolently upon his sister-in-law, seemed quite to forget she was \"a\nyoung lady,\" and even was heard to call her \"my child\" four times,--at\nwhich she was very pleased and proud. Over and over again, with youth's\nwild thirst to be happy, she tried to forget the weight on her life,\nand plunge into a temporary gaiety. Sometimes she even caught herself\nlaughing outright, as she played with the children; for no one can be\nmiserable always, especially at nineteen. But whenever she looked up,\nor was silent, or paused to think, the image of her husband came like a\ncloud between her and her mirth. No--she never could be really happy.\n\nNathanael was all day very quiet and abstracted. He did not romp with\nhis little nephews, and only smiled when Harrie teased him for this\nunusual omission of avuncular privilege. Once, Agatha saw him sitting\nwith the youngest little girl fast asleep against his shoulder, he\nlooking over her baby-curls with a pensive, troubled eye, an eye which\nseemed gazing into the future to find there--nothing! A strange thrill\nquivered through Agatha's heart to see him so sitting with that child.\n\nAfter tea Mrs. Dugdale proposed turning out of doors all the masculine\nhalf of the family, except the infant Brian, before whom loomed the\nterrific prospect of bed. So off they started. Gus being seen to snatch\nfrantically at Pa's hand, and Fred, sublime in his first jacket, walking\nalongside with an air and grace worthy of the uncle whose name he bore.\n\n\"There they go,\" cried Mrs. Dugdale, looking fondly after them. \"Not\nbad-looking lads either, considering that Pa isn't exactly a beauty. But\npshaw! what does that signify? I think my Duke's the very nicest face I\nknow. Don't you, Agatha?\"\n\nAgatha warmly acquiesced. She had entirely got over the first impression\nof Duke's plainness. And moreover she was learning day by day that\nmysterious secret which individualises one face out of all the world,\nand makes its very deficiencies more lovely than any other features'\ncharm. She could fully sympathise with Harrie's harmless weakness, and\nagreed--looking at Brian, who in fact strongly resembled his father,\nangelicised into childhood, keeping the same beautiful expression, which\nneeded no change--that if Mr. Dugdale's sons grew up like him in all\npoints, the world would be none the worse, but a great deal the better.\n\nThus talking--which little Brian seemed actually to understand, for he\nstood at her knee gazing up with miraculously merry eyes--Agatha watched\nher sister-in-law's Sunday duty, religiously performed, of putting the\nyounger two to bed, while the nurses went to church, or took walks with\ntheir sweethearts. For, as Harrie sagely observed, \"'the maidens' as\nwe call them in Dorsetshire, 'the maidens' will fall in love as well as\nwe.\"\n\nSo chattering merrily--while she dashed water over Miss Baby's white,\nround limbs, and let Brian caper wildly about the nursery, clad in all\nsorts of half-costumes, or no costume at all--Mrs. Dugdale\ninitiated Agatha into various arcana belonging to motherhood and\nmistress-of-a-family-hood. The other listened eagerly, so eagerly that\nshe could have laughed at herself, remembering what she was six months\nbefore. To think that to-morrow she must begin her house-keeping--she,\nwho knew no more of such things than a child! She snatched at all sorts\nof knowledge, talked over butchers, and bakers, and house expenses, and\nKingcombe ways of marketing, taking an interest in the most commonplace\nthings. For pervading everything was the consciousness, \"It is _his_\nhome I have to make comfortable.\" That thought sanctified and beautified\nall.\n\n\"You are quite right, my dear,\" said Harrie, pausing in her walk up and\ndown, patting and singing to Baby, who stared with open eyes over her\nshoulder, and obstinately declined going to sleep. \"You will turn out a\nnotable woman, I see. It's a curious and melancholy fact, which we don't\never learn till we are married, that all the love in the world is thrown\naway upon a man unless you make him comfortable at home. A neat house\nand a creditable dinner every day go more to his heart than all the\nsentimental devotion you can give. It's all very well for a man in love\nto live upon roses and posies, and kisses and blisses, but after he is\nmarried he dearly likes to be comfortable.\"\n\nAgatha was silent for a moment, hardly venturing to believe, and yet\nafraid she must. \"I heard Miss Valery once say that no man's love after\nmarriage is exactly as it was before it; that the thing attained soon\nloses its preciousness, and that the wife has to assume a new character,\nand win another kind of love. I wonder if this is true. I wonder\"--and\nsuddenly she changed her seriousness for the tone of raillery she always\nused with Harrie Dugdaie--\"I wonder whether our husbands adore us first,\nand afterwards expect us to adore them.\"\n\n\"So they do; I assure you they do! And a pretty amount of adoring\nand waiting upon your husband will require. I wouldn't for the whole\nuniverse have my Duke such an awfully exacting, particular, provoking,\ndisagreeably good, or inexplicably naughty animal as my brother\nNathanael.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Dugdaie!\" Agatha hardly knew whether to laugh or to be indignant.\nShe only knew that she felt ready to spring up like a chained tigress\nwhen anybody said a word against Mr. Harper.\n\n\"There now, don't waken the baby. Keep yourself quiet, do. See, there's\nits husband coming down the street to comfort it. He is looking up here,\ntoo. Run down, do'ee now; and if she'll be a good girl she shall\nhave the neatest household and the best husband in Kingcombe--always\nexcepting mine.\"\n\nAgatha did not run down; but she leant over the landing, and heard the\nfootsteps and voices in the hall--steps and voices which always seem to\nput new life into a house where its ruler is dear to the hearts of wife\nand children. Troubled as she was--laden with even a new weight since\nthe talk with Mrs. Dugdale--Agatha listened, and felt that in spite of\nall, the house seemed brighter for the entrance of _her_ husband. She\ntried to catch what he was saying, but only heard the voice of Mr.\nDugdaie.\n\n\"Of course, as you say, it's necessary. But really tomorrow--so\nsoon--and for such a long time too! Couldn't both go together?\"\n\nNathanael made some inaudible reply.\n\n\"To be sure, you know best. But--poor young thing!--I wonder what my\nHarrie would have said to me. Poor, pretty little thing!\"\n\nThe words, the manner, startled Agatha; She could not make them out. She\ndescended, looking alarmed, uneasy--a look which did not wear off all\nthe rest of the evening.\n\nIn leaving she wondered why Mr. Dugdale woke from his dreaminess to bid\nher good-night with a fatherly air, addressing her more than once by his\nsuperlative of kindness, \"My child.\" When she took her husband's arm\nto go out of the lighted hall-into the night, Agatha trembled, as if\nsomething were going to happen--she knew not what.\n\nThe street was very dark, for Kingcombe people were economisers in gas;\nand besides kept such primitive hours, that at ten o'clock you might\nwalk from one end of the town to the other and not see a light in any\nhouse. There was not a soul abroad except these two, and their feet\nechoed loudly along the pavement. At first Agatha, blinded by coming out\nof light into darkness, saw nothing, but stumbled on, clinging tightly\nto her husband. At length she perceived whereabouts they were--the\nblack, quaintly-gabled houses, the market-cross, and, far above the\nsleepy town and its deserted streets, the bright wonderfully bright\nstars.\n\nAgatha took comfort when she saw the stars.\n\n\"Have we far to go? I am rather tired,\" she said to her husband, chiefly\nfor the sake of saying something.\n\n\"Tired, are you? Then you must have a quiet day tomorrow. It will be\nvery quiet, I doubt not;\" and he sighed.\n\n\"Why so? What is to be done to-morrow? Shall you have to ride over to\nThornhurst?\"\n\n\"No; I saw Anne Valery yesterday. I shall not see her again for a good\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"There is business requiring me in Cornwall. To-morrow I am going away.\"\n\n\"Going away!\" The words were little more than a sigh. She felt all cold\nand numb for the moment. Then a sudden flood of the old impetuous pride\ncame over her. Going away! Leaving his young wife! Leaving her alone in\nher new home--alone the second day, to be wondered at, and pointed\nat, and pitied! Perhaps he did it to humble and punish her. It was\ncruel--cruel! And again the demon or angel--which took such various\nforms that she hardly knew the true one--rose up rampant within her.\n\n\"Mr. Harper, this is sudden--will look strange. You ought to have told\nme before.\"\n\n\"I did not know it myself until last night. That my going to Cornwall is\nnecessary, on business grounds, I have already made clear to Marmaduke.\nHe will tell his wife, and Harriet will tell all the world. I have so\narranged that you will have no difficulty of any kind. This house will\ngo on as usual, or you can visit at Thornhurst and at my father's. There\nwill be no loss to you of anything or anybody--except one, whose absence\nmust be welcome.\" \"Welcome!\" she repeated in an accent of bitter scorn.\n\n\"You said so yourself. Hush! do not say it again. When we part, let it\nbe in peace!\"\n\nHe spoke in a smothered, exhausted voice, and holding the gate open\nfor her to pass, leaned upon it as if he could hardly stand. But Agatha\nperceived nothing--she was dizzy and blind.\n\n\"Peace?\" she repeated, driven mad by the mockery of the word. She\nsaw the door half-open, the warm light glimmering within the hall--so\nsoft--so home-like. The torture was too strong--her senses began to give\nway.\n\nWithout knowing what she did, without any settled purpose except to\nescape from the misery of that sight, Agatha pushed her husband from\nher, turned and fled--fled anywhere, no matter where, so that it was\ninto night and darkness, away from her home and from him.\n\nShe did not know the way; she only knew that she ran up one street and\ndown another like the wind. Her state of mind was bordering on insanity.\nAt length she paused from sheer exhaustion, and leaned against a\ndoorway--like any poor outraged homeless wretch.\n\nThe good man of the house came softly out to look up into the quiet\nnight before he bolted his door. He stood musing, contemplating the\nstars. It was a minute or more before he noticed the bowed human form\nbeside him. When he did, there was no mistaking the compassionate voice.\n\n\"Eh, poor soul! What's wrong wi'ee?\"\n\nAgatha sprang up with a cry. There were two standing by her, from whose\npresence she would gladly have run to the world's end--Mr. Dugdale and\nher husband. The one remained petrified with astonishment--the other\nsaid but three words, in a dull mechanical voice, as if every feeling\nhad been struck out of the man by some thunderbolt of doom.\n\n\"Agatha, come home.\"\n\nAgain she tried to burst from him and fly, but her arm was caught, and\nMarmaduke Dugdale's grave look--the look he fixed upon his own\nchildren when they erred, constraining them always into repentance and\ngoodness--was reading her inmost soul.\n\n\"Go home, poor child! I'll not tell of you or him. Go home with your\nhusband.\"\n\nShe felt her hand laid, or grasped--she knew not which--in that of\nNathanael; who held it with invincible firmness. There was no resisting\nthat clasp. She rose up and followed him, as if led by an invisible\nchain. Her madness had passed, and left only a dull indifference to\neverything. The die was cast; she had laid open the miseries of their\nhome, had disgraced him and herself before the world. It signified\nlittle where she went or what she did; they were utterly separated now.\n\nWithout again speaking, or taking notice of Mr. Dugdale, she suffered\nNathanael to lead her away, passing swiftly down the silent streets.\nNeither husband nor wife uttered a single word.\n\nThe moment she entered the house she walked up-stairs, slowly, that he\nmight not see her tottering; went into her own room, and locked her\ndoor with a loud, fierce turning of the key, that seemed to shriek as it\nturned.\n\nThere, for almost an hour, she sat motionless. The maid, half asleep,\ncame to the door with a light, but Agatha bade her set it down, and sat\nin the dark. Dark--altogether dark, within and without; with no hope\nor repentance, or even the heroism of suffering; wrathful, sullen,\nmiserable; wronged--yet conscious that she had sinned as much as she\nwas sinned against; seeing her husband and herself stand as it were\non either edge of a black gulf, hourly widening, yet neither having\nstrength to plunge it to the other's side.\n\nHere she sat, upright and still, body and soul wrapped in a leaden,\nshroud-like darkness, until gradually a stupor possessed her brain.\n\n\"I am so tired,\" she murmured, \"I must go to sleep. He will not leave\ntill to-morrow. But it does not signify. Nothing signifies. I must go to\nsleep.\"\n\nShe unlocked the door and drew in the candle, flaring in its socket.\nShe had to press her fingers on her eyeballs before they could bear the\nlight, all was so very dark. She Sotted her hair up anyhow, took off her\nclothes, and crept to bed, almost as if she were creeping to her tomb.\nThe fragment of candle went out, sinking instantaneously, like a soul\nquenched out of existence, and all was total darkness. In that darkness\na heavy hand seemed to lay itself on Agatha's brain, and press down her\neyelids. Scarcely two minutes after, she was asleep.\n\nHour after hour of the night went by, and there was not a sound, not\na breath in the room. The late moon rose, and gave a little glimmer of\nlight through the curtains. Now and then there was a faint noise of some\none moving in the house, but Agatha never stirred. She slept heavily as\nsome people invariably sleep under the pressure of great pain.\n\nTowards morning, when moonlight and dawn were melted together, and the\nroom was growing light enough to discern faces, there was a step at the\ndoor, and a ray flashing through the opening, for Agatha had left it\najar.\n\nNathanael set down the candle outside and came in softly. He was dressed\nfor a journey--evidently just ready to start. He looked very ill,\nsleepless, and worn.\n\nStanding a minute at the door, he listened to his wife's breathing, low\nand regular as that of a child. Nature and repose had soothed her; she\nslept now as quietly and healthfully as if she had never known trouble.\nHer husband crept across the room very carefully, and remained watching\nher. Oh! the contrast between the one who _watched_ and the one who\nslept!\n\nAt first he stood perfectly upright, rigid, and motionless.\n\nThen his hands twisted themselves together, and his eyes grew hot,\nbursting. His lips moved as in speaking, though with never a sound. It\nwas the dumbness--the choking dumbness of that emotion which made it\nso terrible. Such silence could not last--he seemed to feel it could\nnot--and so moved backward out of hearing. There he stood for a little\nwhile, leaning against the wall, his hand bound tightly over his\nforehead, and sighing, so bitterly sighing!--that gasp which bursts from\nmen who have no tears.\n\nAt length he became calmer, but still stood without the door. He even\nmoved the candle further off, as though afraid its glare, might disturb\nthe sleeper--forgetful that the room was now growing all bright with\ndaybreak. At this moment the clock striking in the hall below made him\nstart.\n\nHastily he took out a paper that he had hid somewhere about him. It\nwas in his own handwriting, all sealed and endorsed. \"Not to be opened\nexcept in case of my death.\" Nevertheless he tore it open--tore likewise\nan under-cover addressed to his wife, and began to read:\n\n\"I know you never loved me. From something I overheard on our\nmarriage-day--from other words afterwards let fall in anger by my\nbrother, I also know that you loved\"--\n\nHe crushed the paper, his eyes seeming literally to flame. Then all the\nfury died out of them, and left nothing but tenderness. He listened for\nthe soft breathing within--soft and pure.\n\n\"No!\" he murmured. \"I will not leave her honour to the chance of written\nwords. No other human being must ever know what I knew. If I live, it\nis not worse than it was before; and should any harm come to me, let her\nthink I died in ignorance. Better so.\"\n\nHe tore the paper into small strips, and deliberately burnt them one\nby one in the candle, making a little pile of the ashes, but afterwards\nscattering them about the fireplace. Then putting out the light--for\nthe house was now filled with the soft grey dawn--Nathanael stepped once\nmore into his wife's room.\n\nAnd still she was sleeping--sleeping at the very crisis of her fate. Her\nface was composed and sweet, though her hands were still clenched, and\none of them almost buried in her loose hair.\n\nHer husband stood and looked at her, trying long to keep himself firm\nand self-restrained, as though she were aware of his presence. But at\nlast the holy helplessness of sleep subdued him. From standing upright\nhe sank gradually down--down--till he was crouching on his knees.\nShudder over shudder came over him--sigh after sigh rose up, and was\nsmothered again in his breast. At last even the strong man's strength\ngave way, and there fell a heavy, silent, burning rain.\n\nAnd all the while the wife slept, and never knew how he loved her!\n\nAfter a while this ceased. Nathanael opened his eyes and tried to look\nonce more calmly on his wife. She stirred a little in sleep, and began\nto smile--a very soft, meek, innocent smile, that softened her lips into\ninfantine sweetness. She was again Agatha, the merry Agatha, as she had\nbeen when he first saw her, before he wooed her, and shook her roughly\nfrom her girlish calm into all the struggles of life. He could have\ncursed himself--and yet--yet he loved her!\n\nKneeling, he put his arm softly over her. Another moment and he would\nhave yielded to the frantic impulse, and snatched her to his heart for\none--just one embrace--heedless of her waking. But how would she wake?\nonly to hate and reproach him. He had better leave her thus, and carry\naway in his remembrance that picture of peace, which blotted out all\nher bitter words, all her cruel want of love--made him forget everything\nexcept that she had been the wife of his bosom and his first love.\n\nHe drew back his arm, gradually and noiselessly. He did not attempt to\nkiss her, not even her hand, lest he should disturb her; but kneeling,\nlaid his hand on the pillow by hers, and pressed his lips to her hair.\n\n\"I am glad she sleeps--yes, very glad! She is quite content now, she\nwill be quite happy when I am gone, God love thee and take care of\nthee--my darling--my Agatha.\"\n\n[Illustration: A husband's farewell  p280]\n\nKissing her hair once again, he rose up and went away.\n\nAs he departed, the first sunbeam came in and danced upon the bed,\nshowing Agatha fast asleep, sleeping still. She never woke until it had\nbeen broad day for a long time, and the sun creeping over her pillow\nstruck her eyes.\n\nThen she started up with a loud cry--she had been dreaming. Tears were\nwet upon her cheek. She called wildly for her husband. It was too late.\n\nHe had been gone at least three hours.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\"Mrs. Harper--Missus--there's a carriage at the door.\"\n\n\"Say I am not at home.\"\n\nShe had given the same sullen answer to every visitor for four weeks,\nshutting herself up in stern seclusion, determined that, whatever cruel\ncomments they made, the neighbourhood should have no power of spying\ninto the mystery of \"that poor Mrs. Locke Harper who did not live happy\nwith her husband.\" For so she felt sure had been the result of that\nfatal betrayal to her brother-in-law. Since, as Harrie had once said,\n\"Duke never could keep a secret in his life!\" But even his own wife\ncould not thoroughly fathom the good heart of Marmaduke Dugdale.\n\n\"Not at home?\" repeated Dorcas, who had been very faithful to her young\nmistress. \"Not when it's Miss Valery, who has been so ill? Oh, Missus,\ndo'ee see Miss Valery.\"\n\nMrs. Harper hesitated, and during that time her visitor entered\nuninvited.\n\n\"So, Agatha, as you did not come to see me, I have come at last to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"I am sorry\"--\n\n\"What, to see me?\" said Anne, smiling. But the voice was weak, and the\nsmile had a sickly beauty. Agatha was struck by a change, slight, yet\nperceptible, which had come over Miss Valery.\n\n\"I hear you have been ill--will you take the arm-chair? Are you better\nto day?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" returned Anne, briefly; she was never much in the habit of\ntalking about herself. \"But you, my dear, how have you been this long\ntime? Come and let me look at you.\"\n\n\"It is not worth while. Never mind me. Talk of something else.\"\n\n\"Of your husband, then. When did you hear from him?\"\n\n\"Last week.\"\n\n\"And is he quite well? Will you give a message to him from me when you\nwrite again?\"\n\n\"I never write.\"\n\nMiss Valery looked surprised, pained. Evidently to her sick-room had\nreached the vaguest possible hints of what had happened. Or else Anne\nmust have refused to hear or credit what she was persuaded was an\nimpossible falsehood. In all good hearts scandal unrepeated, unbelieved,\ndies a natural death.\n\nTo Mrs. Harper's brief, sharp sentence there was no reply; her guest\nturned to other topics.\n\n\"Harriet Dugdale comes home to-morrow. It is not often she takes it into\nher head to pay a three weeks' visit from home. You must have missed her\na good deal.\"\n\n\"No, I did not. I have never been outside the garden.\"\n\n\"Was that quite right, my dear? And your sisters-in-law complain\nbitterly that you will not go to Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\n\"They should have taken more trouble in coming to ask me.\n\n\"Nay, in this world we should not judge too harshly. We cannot see into\nany one's motives. There may have been reasons. I know the Squire has\nnot been at all well; and Mary has spent her whole time in watching him,\nand in coming to Thornhurst to nurse me.\"\n\n\"Have you been so very ill, then? I wish--I wish--\"\n\n\"That you also had come to see me? Well, you will come now. Not to-day;\nfor I am going to use this lovely autumn morning in taking a journey.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To Weymouth, opposite the Isle of Portland.\"\n\nAfter this answer both were silent. Agatha was thinking of the night\nwhen her husband rode to Weymouth. Anne was thinking--of what?\n\nAt length she put her thoughts aside, and turned to watch the young\nwife, who had fallen into a sullen, absent mood.\n\n\"Does your house please you, Agatha? It is very pretty, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes, very. I do not complain. Would you like to look over it? Or shall\nI give you some cake and wine? That is the fashion, I believe, when a\nvisitor first comes to see a bride in her new home.\"\n\nThe bitterness, the sarcasm of her manner were pitiful to see. Anne\nValery watched her, sadly, yet not hopelessly. There was in the calm of\nthat pale face a clearness of vision which pierced through many human\ndarknesses to the light behind.\n\nShe only said, \"Thank you, I will take some wine; I like to keep up\ngood old customs,\"--and waited while Mrs. Harper, with a quick excited\nmanner, and a countenance that changed momentarily, did the first\nhonours of her household. So sad it was to see her doing it all alone!\nMore widow-like than bride-like.\n\nAs she came up with the wine-glass, Miss Valery caught her hand, holding\nit firmly in defiance of Agatha's slight effort to get free.\n\n\"Wait a minute for my good wishes to the bride. May God bless you! Not\nwith fortune, which is oftentimes only a curse\"--\n\n\"That is true,\" muttered Agatha, bitterly.\n\n\"Not with perfect freedom from care, for that is impossible, or, if\npossible, would not be good for you. Every one of us must bear our own\nburden; and we can bear it, if we love one another.\"\n\nAgatha's lips were set together.\n\n\"If,\" continued Anne, firmly--\"If we love any one with sincerity and\nfaithfulness, we are sure to reap our reward some time. If any love us,\nand we believe it and trust them, they are sure to come out clear from\nall clouds, our own beloved, true to the end. Therefore, Agatha, above\nall blessings, may God bless you with _love_! May you be happy in your\nhusband, and make him happy! May you live to see your home merry\nand full--not silent!--may you die among your children and your own\npeople--not alone!\"\n\nThe sudden solemnity of this blessing, enhanced by the feebleness of\nthe voice that uttered it, awoke strange emotions in Agatha. She threw\nherself on her knees by the armchair, where Anne lay back--now faint and\npale.\n\n\"Oh, if you had been near me--if I had known you always, and you had\nbrought me up, and made a good woman of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I ought,\" murmured Anne, thoughtfully. \"But, just then, it\nwould have been so hard--so hard!\"\n\n\"What are you saying? Say it again. All your words are good words. Tell\nme.\"\n\n\"Nothing, dear. Except\"--here Miss Valery raised herself with a sudden\neffort mental and bodily--\"Agatha, will you go with me to Weymouth?\"\n\n\"If you like. Anywhere to be with you. I am sick of myself.\"\n\n\"We all are at times, especially when we are young, and do not quite\nunderstand ourselves or others. The feeling passes away. But as to\nWeymouth--do you still dislike to go near the sea?\"\n\n\"Yes--no! I will try to bear it; I think I could, by your side. And you\nshall not go alone on any account.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Anne, taking her hand. So they went.\n\nAn innocent line of railway darted past Kingcombe, in the vain hope of\nwaking that somnolent town. It was a pleasant whirl across the usual\nbreezy flats of moorland, by some meadows where a network of serpentine\nstreams flashed in the sun. Agatha felt more like her own self; with\nher, the spirit of Nature was always an exorciser of internal demons;\nand Anne's conversation aided the beneficent work.\n\nAt Dorchester they took a carriage, and drove across the country to\nWeymouth.\n\n\"Are you not getting weary? you looked so but lately,\" said Agatha to\nMiss Valery.\n\n\"Not at all, I feel strong now.\" Her eyes and cheeks were indeed very\nbright; she leaned forward and gazed eagerly around.\n\n\"This Weymouth seems familiar to you, Miss Valery?\"\n\n\"Yes; we used to come here every summer--Mr. and Mrs. Harper and the\nchildren and I, until she died. She was as good as a mother, or an elder\nsister\"--here Anne hesitated, but repeated the words--\"like an elder\nsister--to me. We were all very happy in those times. It is a great\nblessing, Agatha, to have had a happy childhood. Where did you spend\nyours?\"\n\nAgatha looked uneasy. \"Chiefly in London--I told you.\"\n\n\"But before then, when you were a very little girl?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Don't let us talk about that.\"\n\n\"Not if you do not wish it.\" Anne's eyes, which had watched her closely,\nturned away, and after a few minutes were riveted on a line of blue sea\nsweeping round a distant headland, and curving off to the horizon. As\nshe looked she became very pale, and shivered. Agatha hardly noticed\nher, being so busy examining the new regions into which they now\nentered--the ordinary High Street of an ordinary country town. The sea\nview had vanished.\n\nSuddenly the carriage turned a corner, and they burst upon the shore of\nWeymouth Bay. A great, blue, glittering bay, with two white headlands\nshutting it in; the tide running high, the waves dashing themselves\nfuriously against the sea-wall of the esplanade, breaking into showers\nof spray, and curling back into the foaming whirl below.\n\nAgatha started, and put her hands before her eyes. \"I know that sight--I\nremember that sound. Oh! where is this place? why did you bring me\nhere?\"\n\nAt this cry Miss Valery, roused from her momentary fit of abstraction,\ntook hold of Agatha's hand. The girl was trembling violently.\n\n\"My dear, I did not expect this, or you should not have come here. This\nis Weymouth. Now do you remember?\"\n\n\"How should I? Was I ever here before?\" She peered from under her hand at\nthe sparkling sea. \"No, it is not like that sea; it is too bright. Yet I\nhear the same roll against the same wall. It is very foolish, but I wish\nwe could get away.\"\n\n\"Presently,\" said Anne's soothing voice. \"We must drive along this\nshore, and then we will get out at an inn I know, and rest.\"\n\nHer manner, her expression, as she fixed her eyes full upon her, struck\nAgatha with an indescribable feeling. She looked eagerly at Miss Valery,\ntrying to read in that worn face some likeness to the one which had\nimpressed her childish memory with almost angelic beauty.\n\n\"Tell me--you say you have been often here--did you ever one stormy day\nfollow a ship that was outward bound? You were in a little boat, and the\nship was standing out to sea, round that point--and\"--\n\nShe stopped, for Anne's face was livid to the very lips. Agatha forgot\nher own question and its purport.\n\n\"Stop the carriage. Let me hold you. Dear--dear Miss Valery, you are\nworn out--you are fainting.\"\n\n\"No--I never faint--I am only tired. Don't speak to me for a minute or\ntwo, and I shall be well.\"\n\nWith a long sigh she forcibly brought life back to her cheeks--a feeble\nlife at best. Agatha, watching her, was smitten by a dread which\nnow entered her mind for the first time, driving thence all personal\nfeelings, and making her gaze with sorrowful anxiety on the friend\nbeside her who had been all day so cheerful and kind. And she thought\nwith a remorse amounting to positive horror, that she herself during\nthat day had more than once spoken sharply even to Anne Valery.\n\nA great awe came upon her, reflecting how often we unconsciously walk\nhand-in-hand, and talk of our own petty earthly trials, with those whose\nsouls' wings are already growing, already stirring with the air that\ncomes to bear them to the unseen land.\n\nIt was a relief indescribable, when leisurely strolling along the\npavement, she saw among many strange faces one that seemed familiar. The\nhands knotted loosely at his back, the light hair straggling out from\nunder the hat, that was pushed far up from the forehead--no, she could\nnot be mistaken. She uttered a cry of pleasure.\n\n\"Look, look! there he is; I am certain it is he.\"\n\nAnne started violently.\n\n\"Mr. Dugdale, Mr. Dugdale!\" Agatha called out.\n\nHe came up to the carriage with the most lengthened \"E--h!\" that she had\never heard him utter. \"What brought you two here? This bleak day too.\nVery wrong of Anne!\"\n\n\"But she would come. She said she wanted a breath of sea-air, and I\nthink, besides, she has business.\"\n\n\"No,\" interrupted Anne, \"no business, except bringing Agatha to see\nWeymouth. Now shall we rest, and have some tea at the inn. You'll come\nwith us, Mr. Dugdale?\"\n\n\"Yes, I want to speak to you, Anne. I've got news about--that little\naffair you know of. That was why I came to Weymouth to-day. Eh,\nnow--just look there!\"\n\nWith a countenance brimful of pleasure he came to Miss Valery's side,\nand pointed to a steamer that lay in the offing.\n\n\"It's the _Anna Mary_. She made the passage from New York in no time.\nI've been aboard her already. I fancied I might find him there. Now,\nwhat do you think, Anne?\"\n\n\"Is he come?\" said Anne, in a steady voice. She had quite recovered\nherself now.\n\n\"No--not this time. But he will sail, for certain, by the next New York\npacket to Havre.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" It was a very low answer--just a sigh, and nothing more.\n\n\"And we have satisfactorily ended all that business which you first put\ninto my head,\" continued Duke, rubbing his hands with great glee. \"It\nwas a risk certainly, but then it was for him. My children will never be\na bit the poorer.\"\n\n\"No,\" murmured Anne Valery to herself.\n\n\"And think what an election we shall have! With him to make speeches for\nTrenchard, and argue in this wonderful way about Free-trade, and tell\nthe farmers all about Canadian wheat! Glorious!\"\n\n\"What are you both talking about?\" cried Agatha, who had been\nconsiderably puzzled. \"Do let me hear, if it is not a secret.\"\n\n\"No secret,\" said Anne, turning round, speaking clearly and composedly,\nand not at all like a sick person. \"Mr. Brian Harper is coming home.\"\n\nAgatha clapped her hands for joy.\n\nWhen they dismounted from the carriage, and had ordered tea at the\ninn, Anne still seemed quite strong. She said it was the sea-breeze that\nbrought life to her, and stood at the open window gazing over the bay.\nAgatha thought she had never seen Miss Valery's face so near looking\nbeautiful as now; it was the faint reflex of girlhood's brightness, like\nthe zodiacal light which the sun casts on the sky long after he has gone\ndown.\n\nAfter tea,--at which meal Mr. Dugdale did not appear, a fact that nobody\nwondered at, since he was left to wander about Weymouth at his own sweet\nwill, without Harrie to catch him and remind him that there was such\na thing as time, likewise such sublunary necessities as eating and\ndrinking--after tea Miss Valery and Mrs. Harper sat at the window\ntogether.\n\nIt was only an inn-window, the panes scribbled over with many names, and\nit lighted an ordinary inn-parlour, looking on the esplanade. Yet it\nwas a pleasant seat; quiet, too, for the town was almost deserted as\nwinter-time came on. The bay, smoothed by the ebbing tide, lay like\ncrystal under a sky where sunset and moonlight mixed. Agatha ventured to\nlook at the sea now. She beheld with a curious interest a sight till now\nso unfamiliar, taking a childish pleasure in watching the great white\narm of moon-rays stretch further and further across the water, changing\nthe ripples into molten silver, and making ethereal and ghostlike every\nlittle boat that glided through them.\n\nBy-and-by came a group of wandering musicians, playing very respectably,\nas German street-musicians always do. They converted the dark esplanade\nand the shabby inn-parlour into a fairy picture of visible and audible\nromance.\n\n\"It is quite like a scene in a play,\" said Agatha, laughing and\ntrying to make Miss Valery laugh. She could not see her clearly in the\nmoonlight, but she did not like her sitting so quiet and silent.\n\n\"Yes, very like a play, with '_Herz, mein Herz,_' for a serenade. What a\nsweet old tune it is!\"\n\n\"I used to sing it once.\" And Agatha began following the instruments\nwith her voice. \"No, I can't sing. I could sooner cry.\"\n\n\"Why? Are you sorrowful?\"\n\n\"No--happy. Yet all feels strange, very strange.\" She crept to Miss\nValery, wrapped her arms round her waist, and laid her head timidly on\nher shoulder. Anne drew her nearer, with a more caressing manner than\nshe ever used to any one. Agatha Harper seemed that night of all nights\nto lie very near her heart.\n\n\"_Herz, mein Herz,_\" died faintly away down the esplanade; there was\nnothing but the glitter of the bay, and the moon climbing higher and\nhigher above the Isle of Portland.\n\nAnne spoke at last, amidst the half-playful, half-tender caresses that\nwere so dear to Agatha, who had never known what it was to be calmly and\nsafely in a mother's arms. Lying thus seemed most like it.\n\n\"Do you think I care for you, Agatha, my child?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell. Perhaps not, for I am not good enough to deserve it.\"\n\n\"Do you know what first made me care for you?\"\n\n\"No--unless it was for the sake of my husband.\"\n\nAnne gave no reply, and her husband's name plunged Agatha into such a\nmaze of painful thought, that she was for a long time altogether silent.\n\n\"Shall I tell you a story, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Anything--anything, to keep me from thinking.\"\n\n\"If I do, it is one you must not tell again, unless to Nathanael, for I\nwould put no secrets between husband and wife.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is right--that is kind. Would that _he_ had thought the same!\"\n\n\"What did you say, dear?\"\n\n\"Nothing! Nothing of any consequence. Don't mind me. Go on.\"\n\n\"It is a history which I think it right and best to tell you. You will\nboth need to keep it sacred for a little while--not for very long.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a shudder passed through Anne's frame. Was it the\ninvoluntary shrinking of mortality in sight of immortality?\n\nShortly afterwards she began to talk in her usual sweet tone--perhaps a\nshade more serious.\n\n\"'There were once two _friends_--three I should say, but the third far\nless intimate than the other two. Something happened--it is now too long\nago to signify what--which made the elder of the first two angry with\nhis dearest friend and the other. He went away suddenly, writing word to\nhis friend--his own--that he should sail next day, leaving England for\never.\"\n\n\"That was wrong!\" cried Agatha. \"People ought never to be passionate and\nunjust in friendship. It was very wrong.\"\n\n\"Hush! you do not know all the circumstances; you cannot judge,\" Anne\nanswered hastily. \"His friend, who greatly honoured him, and knew what\npain his loss would bring to many, wished to prevent his going. She\"--\n\n\"It was a woman, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And were they _only_ friends?\"\n\n\"They were friends,\" repeated Miss Valery, in a tone which, doubtful as\nthe answer was, made Agatha feel she had no right to inquire further.\n\n\"She never knew how much he cared for her until that last letter he\nwrote, just after he had gone away. On receiving it, she followed\nhim--which she had a right to do--to the place he mentioned, a seaport\nfrom which he was to sail. When she reached it, the vessel had already\nheaved anchor and was standing out to sea. She saw it--the very ship he\nwas on board--in the middle of the bay.\"\n\n\"The bay! Was it then\"--\n\n\"Hush, dear, just for a little,--I cannot speak long. It was a stormy\nday, and few boats would go out. However, there was on the beach a woman\nwho was also very eager to catch the vessel. Together they managed to\nget a boat, and embarked--this lady I speak of--the woman and a little\ngirl.\"\n\nAgatha listened with painful avidity.\n\n\"It was not the woman's own child, or she could not have been so\ncareless of it It was tossed into the bottom of the boat, and lay there\ncrying. The lady felt sorry for it, and took it in her arms. They had\ngone but a little way from the shore when it was playing about her,\nquite happy again. While playing--she looking at the ship, and not\nwatching the little thing as she ought to have done--the child fell\noverboard.\"\n\nA loud sob burst from Agatha.\n\n\"Hush, still hush, my darling! The child was saved. The ship sailed\naway, but the child--you _know_ that she was saved. I am thankful to God\nit was so!\"\n\nAnne wrapped her arms tightly round the sobbing girl, and after a few\nmoments she also wept.\n\n\"I remember it all now,\" cried Agatha, as soon as she found words--\"the\nshore, the headlands, the bay. I was that little child, and it was you\nwho saved me!\"\n\nAnne made no answer but by pressing her closer.\n\n\"I felt it the first moment I ever saw you. I never forgot you--never!\nBut how did you know me?\"\n\n\"Was I likely ever to lose sight of that little child? And also, years\nbefore, I had once or twice met your father--though this would have\nbeen nothing. But from that day I felt that you belonged to me. And now,\nsince you are become a Harper, you do.\"\n\nAgatha embraced her, and then suddenly looked mournful.--\"But yourself?\nTell me, did you ever again meet your--your friend?\"\n\nNo answer. A slight movement of the lips sufficed to explain the whole.\n\n\"And it was all through me,\" cried Agatha, to whom that soft smile was\nagony. \"And what have I done in requital? I have lived a useless, erring\nlife; I have suffered--oh, how I have suffered! Far better I had been\nleft lying at the bottom of that quiet bay. Why did God let you save\nme?\"\n\n\"That you might grow up a good and noble woman, fulfilling worthily the\nlife He spared, and giving it back into His hands, in His time, as a\ntrue and faithful servant. Dare not to murmur at His will--dare not to\nask why He saved you, Agatha Harper.\"\n\nSaying this, as sternly as Anne Valery could speak--she tried to put\nAgatha from her breast, but the girl held her too fast.\n\n\"Oh, do not cast me away. I have nobody in the world but you. Forgive\nme! Guide my life which I owe you, and make it worth your saving. Love\nme--teach my husband to love me. If you knew how miserable I am, and may\nbe always.\"\n\n\"No one is miserable always,\" returned Anne faintly, as she leaned back,\nher hands dropping down cold and listless. \"We grow content in time. We\nshall all be--very happy--some day.\"\n\nShe spoke with hesitation and difficulty. The next minute, in spite\nof her declaration that she never fainted, Miss Valery had become\ninsensible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\"What, up and dressed already, without sending for me? Did you not\npromise last night that I should do everything for you just as if I were\nyour child? How very naughty you are, Miss Valery.\"\n\nAgatha spoke rather crossly; it was a relief to speak so. Anne turned\nround--she was sitting at the window of the inn bed-chamber looking on\nWeymouth Bay.\n\n\"Am I naughty? And you have assumed the right to scold me? That is quite\na pleasure. I have had no one to scold me for a great many years.\"\n\nThere was a certain pathos running through her cheerfulness which made\nAgatha's heart burst. She had lain awake half the night thinking of Anne\nValery, and had guessed, or put together many things, which made her\ncome with uncontrollable emotion into the presence of her whose fate had\nbeen so knotted up with her own. For that this circumstance had in\nsome way or other brought about Anne's fate--the one fate of a woman's\nlife--Agatha could not doubt. Neither could she doubt who was this\n\"friend.\" But she said nothing--she felt she had no right.\n\n\"Don't look at the sea, please. Look at me. Tell me how you feel this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Well--quite well. We will go home to-day. What did you tell Mr. Dugdale\nlast night?\"\n\n\"Only what you desired me--that, being wearied, you felt inclined to\nstay the night at Weymouth.\"\n\n\"That was right.--Look, Agatha, how beautiful the sea is. I must teach\nyou not to be afraid of it any more. Next year\"--\n\nShe paused, hesitated, put her hand to her heart, as she often did, and\nceased to speak; but Agatha eagerly continued the sentence:\n\n\"Next year we will come and stay here, you and I; or perhaps, as a very\ngreat favour, we'll admit one or two more. Next year, when you are quite\nstrong, remember. We will be very happy, next year.\"\n\nShe repeated the words strongly, resolutely, dinning them into Miss\nValery's ear, but she only won for answer that silent smile which went\nto her heart like an arrow. She rushed for safety to the commonplaces of\nlife, to the quick, hasty speeches which relieved her. She began to be\nvery cross about some delay in breakfast.\n\n\"Never mind me, dear,\" said Anne's quieting tones. \"I am quite well, and\nwant nothing. Only let us sit still, and look at the sea.\" And she drew\nher from her eager bustling about the inn-parlour to the place where\nthey had both sat the previous night. Agatha balanced herself on the arm\nof the chair, determined she would not be serious for an instant, and\nwould not let Anne talk. Yet both resolutions were broken ere long.\nPerhaps it was the bright stillness of the sea view, sliding away round\nthe headland into infinity, which impressed her in spite of herself.\nStill she struggled against her feelings.\n\n\"I will not have you so grave, Miss Valery. Mind, I will not.\"\n\n\"Am I grave? Nay, only quiet; and so happy! Do you know what it is to be\nquite content with everything in one's life--past, present, and to come,\nknowing that all is overruled for good, forgiving everybody and loving\neverybody?\"\n\nAgatha linked her arms tighter round Miss Valery's neck.\n\n\"Don't talk in that way, or look in that way--don't. Be wicked! Speak\ncross! I will not have you an angel. I will not feel your wings growing.\nI'll tear them out. There.\"\n\nShe laughed--laughed with brimming eyes--until she sobbed again. Her\nfeelings had been on the stretch for hours, and now gave way. Anne bent\ndown from her serenity to notice and soothe the wayward child.\n\n\"Poor little thing, she wants taking care of as much as anybody. When\nwill her husband come home?\"\n\n\"Never--never!\" cried Agatha, hardly knowing what she said. \"I shall\nlose him--you--all.\"\n\nMiss Valery smiled--the composed smile of one who ascending a mountain,\nsees the lowland mazes around laid out distinct and clear, and looks\nover them to their ending.\n\n\"Yes, my child, he will come back. Absence breaks slender ties, but it\nrivets strong ones. Have faith in him. People like him, if they once\nlove, love always. He will come back.\"\n\nThere was a great light in Miss Valery's countenance, which irresistibly\nattracted Agatha. She dried her eyes, forgot her own personal cares, and\nlistened to the comforter.\n\n\"Think how much we love those that are away. Once perhaps we used to\nvex and slight them and be cross with them, but now we carry them in our\nhearts always. We forget everything bitter, and remember only the sweet;\nhow good they were, and how dearly we loved them. Our thoughts and\nprayers follow them continually, flying over and about them like\nwandering angels, that must be laden with good. And all this loving--all\nthis waiting--all this praying, year after year--I mean day after\nday\"--she suddenly turned to Agatha. \"Be content, my child. He will come\nback.\"\n\nAgatha made no reply. She was not thinking of herself just then. She\nwas thinking of the life, compared to which her own nineteen commonplace\nyears sank into nothingness; of the love beside which that feeling she\nhad so called, looked mean and poor; of the patient endurance--what was\nher patience? And yet she had fancied that never was woman so tried as\nAgatha Harper.\n\nWith a resolve as sudden as brave, and in her present state of mind\nto be brave at all it must needs be sudden, Agatha determined to put\nherself and her troubles altogether aside, and think only of those whom\nshe loved.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, and rose up strong in the courage of self-denial. \"We\nwill indulge in no more dreariness; it is not good for you, and I won't\nallow it, my patient. You shall be patient, in every sense, for a little\nwhile longer, and then we'll all be very happy--_all_, I say, next\nyear.\"\n\nWith this declaration she made ready to carry her friend off to\nKingcombe--to her own little house--where she was bent on detaining Anne\nprisoner. Miss Valery declared herself quite willing to be thus bound\nfor a day or two, until she was strong enough to go to Kingcombe Holm.\n\n\"But I'll not let you go--I'll be jealous. Why must you be wandering off\nto that dreary place?\"\n\n\"Its not dreary to me; I always loved Kingcombe Holm; and I must pay it\none last visit before--before winter.\"\n\n\"But there is plenty of time,\" returned Agatha, hastily. \"Why go just\nnow?\"\n\n\"Because\"--Miss Valery spoke after a moment's pause, very\nsteadfastly--\"Because I have reasons for so doing. My old friend, Mr.\nHarper, has a few strong prejudices, some of them to the hurt of his\nbrother, and I wish to talk to him myself before Mr. Brian Harper comes\nhome.\"\n\nWhile Miss Valery said this name, Agatha had carefully bent her eyes\nseaward. In answering, her colour rose--her manner was more troubled and\nhesitating by far than that of her companion.\n\n\"Go, then. I will not hinder you. Nobody can feel more interest than I\ndo in Uncle Brian. When do you think he will be here?\"\n\n\"In three weeks, most likely.\"\n\nAnne made no other remark, nor did Agatha. In a short time they were\ndriving homeward along the margin of the bay. That well-remembered bay,\nthe sight of which even now made Agatha feel as if she were dreaming\nover again the one awful event of her childhood. And Anne--what felt\nshe? No wonder that she did not talk.\n\nThey came to a spot where the formal esplanade merged into a lonely\nsea-side walk, leading towards the widening mouth of the bay, and\ncommanding the farthest view of the Channel as it curved down westward\ninto the horizon. Agatha turned pale.\n\n\"I remember it--that line of coast with the grey clouds over it. I lay\non these sands, and afterwards when you fell, I sat and cried over\nyou. This was the place, and it was over that point that the ship\ndisappeared.\"\n\nAnne was speechless.\n\nAgatha clasped her hand:--they understood one another. The next minute\nthe carriage turned. Miss Valery breathed a quick sigh, and bent\nhurriedly forward; but the glitter of the ocean had vanished--she had\nseen the last of Weymouth Bay.\n\nIt was a weary journey, for Anne seemed very feeble. Her young nurse was\nthankful when the flashing network of streams told how near they were\nwhirling towards Kingcombe. As the train stopped, Mrs. Dugdale was\nvisible on the platform; Duke also, not at the station--that being a\ndegree of punctuality quite impossible--but a little way down the road.\n\n\"Well, Miss Anne Valery and Mrs. Locke Harper! To be gallivanting about\nin this way! I declare it's quite disgraceful. What have you to say for\nyourselves? Here have I been running up to every train to meet you, and\ntell you\"--\n\n\"What?\" Agatha's cheek flushed with expectation. Anne grew very white.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Harper, you need not be so hasty--'tisn't your husband.\nA great blessing if it were. All the town is crying shame on him for\nstaying away so long.\"\n\nAgatha threw a furious look at her sister, and dragged Miss Valery\nalong, nor stopped till she saw the latter could hardly breathe or\nstand.\n\n\"Stay, my child. Harriet, you should not say such things. Nathanael is\nonly absent on business--my business; he will come home soon.\"\n\nThese words, uttered with difficulty, calmed the rising storm. Harrie\nlaughingly begged pardon, and was satisfied.\n\n\"Well, the sooner Nathanael comes, the better. There was a gentleman\nlast night wanting him.\"\n\n\"What gentleman?\"\n\n\"Can't tell. He left no name. A little wiry shrimp of a fellow who\nseemed to know all about our family, Fred included; so Duke, in his\nultra hospitality, took the creature in for the night, and this morning\ndrove him over to Kingcombe Holm. There, don't let us bother ourselves\nabout him. How do you feel now, Anne? Quite well, eh?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" Anne echoed in her cheerful voice that never had a tone\nof pain or complaining. But it seemed to strike Mr. Dugdale, who had\nlounged up to her side. His peculiarly gentle and observant look rested\non her for a moment, and then he offered her his arm, an act of courtesy\nvery rare in the absent Duke Dugdale. Agatha walked on her other hand;\nHarrie fluttering about them, and talking very fast, chiefly about the\nwonderful news of yesterday, which her husband had just communicated.\n\n\"And a great shame not to tell me long before. As if I did not care\nfor Uncle Brian as much as anybody does. What a Christmas we shall\nhave--Uncle Brian, Nathanael, and Fred.\"\n\n\"Is Major Harper coming?\" The question was from Anne.\n\n\"Elizabeth hopes so. He surely will not disappoint Elizabeth. And he\nmust come to see Uncle Brian; they were such friends, you know. All the\nmiddle-aged oddities in Kingcombe are on the _qui vive_ to see\nUncle Brian and Fred. They two were the finest young fellows in the\nneighbourhood, people say, and to think they should both come back\nmiserable old bachelors! Nobody married but my poor Duke! Hurra!\"\n\nSo she rattled on until they reached Agatha's door. One of the Kingcombe\nHolm servants stood there with the carriage. Mrs. Locke Harper was\nwanted immediately, to dine at her father-in-law's.\n\n\"I will not go. I will not leave Miss Valery. They don't often ask\nme--indeed, I have never been since--No, I will not go,\" she added\nobstinately.\n\n\"Do!\" entreated Anne, who had sat down, faint with a walk so short that\nno one thought of its fatiguing her--not even Agatha.\n\n\"T' Squire do want'ee very bad, Missus. Here!\" And the old coachman,\nalmost as old as his master, gave to Mrs. Harper a note, which was only\nthe second she had ever received from her husband's father. It was a\ncrabbed, ancient hand, blotted and blurred, then steadied resolutely\ninto the preciseness of a school-boy--one of those pathetic fragments of\nwriting that irresistibly remind one of the trembling failing hand--the\nhand that once wrote brave love-letters.\n\n\"You are highly favoured; my father rarely writes to any one. What does\nhe say?\" cried Harrie, rather jealous.\n\nAgatha read aloud:\n\n     \"My dear Daughter-in-law,\n\n     \"Will you honour me by dining here to-day, without fail?\n\n     \"I remain, always your affectionate Father,\n\n     \"Nathanael Harper.\"\n\n\"'Your affectionate Father,'\" repeated Mrs. Dugdale. \"He hardly ever\nsigned that to me in his life, though I am his very own daughter, and\nhis eldest too. He never signed so to anybody but Fred. Bah! what a big\nblot He is almost past writing, poor dear man! Come, Agatha, you cannot\nrefuse; you must go.\"\n\n\"She must indeed,\" echoed Anne Valery.\n\n\"Even though the Squire has been so rude as never to ask me or Duke,\nthough Duke saw him this very morning, when he rode over to Kingcombe\nHolm to tell the news about Uncle Brian.--Bless us, Anne, don't look\nso. Is there anything astonishing in my father's letter? How very queer\neverybody seems to-day!\"\n\nAgatha felt Miss Valery draw her aside.\n\n\"You will surely go, my dear, since he wishes it.\"\n\n\"But if I don't wish it--if I had far rather stay with you! Why are you\nso anxious for my leaving you?\"\n\n\"Are you angry with me again, my child?\"--Agatha clung to her fondly.\n\"Then go. Behave specially well to your husband's father. And stay--say\nI am coming to see him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But you cannot--you are not strong.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, very strong,\" Anne returned hastily. \"Only go. I will stay\ncontentedly with Dorcas.\"\n\nAgatha went, very much against her will She had shut herself up entirely\nfor so long. It was a torment to see any one, above all her husband's\nfamily, who of course were constantly talking and inquiring about him.\nThe stateliness of Kingcombe Holm chafed her beyond endurance; Mary's\ngood-natured regrets, and Eulalie's malicious prying condolings; worst\nof all the penetration of Elizabeth. She fancied that they and all\nKingcombe were pointing the finger at \"poor Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\n\nPondering over all these things during the solitary drive, her good\nresolutions faded out from her, and her heart began to burn anew. It was\nso hard!\n\nShe crossed the hall--the same hall where she had alighted when\nNathanael first brought her home. It looked dusky and dim, as then.\nShe almost expected to see him appear from some corner, with his light,\nquick step and his long fair hair.\n\nIt was hard indeed--too hard! She hurried through, and never looked\nbehind.\n\nEulalie and Mary were sitting solemnly in the drawing-room.\n\n\"So you are come, Mrs. Harper. We never thought you would come again. We\nthought you would sit for ever pining in your cage till your mate came\nback again. What a naughty wandering bird he is!\"\n\n\"Don't, Eulalie. No teasing. I am sure we were all very sorry for your\nloneliness, dear Agatha.\"\n\n\"Thank you for giving yourselves that trouble.\"\n\n\"Oh, no trouble at all,\" said the well-meaning and simple Mary. \"And we\nwould have come to see you or fetched you here, but I had to go so\nmuch to Thornhurst while Anne was ill, and Eulalie--somehow--I don't\nknow--but Eulalie is always busy.\"\n\nEulalie, whose hardest toil was looking in the glass, and patting her\ndog's ears, assented apologetically. Perhaps she read something in her\nsister-in-law's face which showed her that Agatha was not to be trifled\nwith.\n\n\"Will you go up and see Elizabeth? She has often asked for you.\"\n\n\"Has she? I will go after dinner,\" briefly answered Agatha She would not\nbe got rid of in that way.\n\n\"Shall we sit and talk then, till my father comes in with that queer\nlittle man who has been with him all day? about whom Mary and I have\nbeen vainly puzzling our brains. Such an ugly little fellow, and,\nbetween you and me, not _quite_ a gentleman. I wonder at papa's asking\nhim to stay and dine. I shan't do the civil to him; you may.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the permission.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that is the very reason Papa sent for you,\" continued Eulalie,\nstretching herself out on the sofa. \"The person said he knew you,\nand asked Mary where you were living, and whether you were very happy\ntogether, you and your husband.\"\n\nAgatha rose abruptly, dashing down a heavy volume that lay on her\nknee--she certainly had not a mild temper. While she wavered between\nreining in her anger as she had last night vowed, and pouring upon\nEulalie all the storm of her roused passions--the door opened, and Mr.\nHarper entered with his much-depreciated guest.\n\nThe old gentleman was dressed with unusual care, and walked with even\nmore of slow stateliness than ordinary. He met Agatha with his customary\nkindness.\n\n\"Welcome. You have been somewhat of a stranger lately. It must not\nhappen again, my dear.\" And drawing her arm through his, he faced the\n\"little ugly fellow\" of Eulalie's dislike.\n\n\"Mr. Grimes, let me present you to my son's wife, Mrs. Locke Harper.\"\n\n\"You forget, sir,\" interrupted Grimes, importantly; \"I have long ago had\nthat honour, through Major\"--\n\nThe old Squire started, put his hand to his forehead--\"Yes, yes, I did\nforget. My memory, sir--my memory is as good as ever it was.\"\n\nThe sharp contradictory ending of his speech, the colour rising to the\nold man's cheek and forehead, whence it did not sink, but lay steadily,\na heavy, purple blotch, attracted Agatha's notice--certainly more than\nMr. Grimes did.\n\n\"I had the honour, Mrs. Harper,\" said the latter, bowing, \"to be present\nwhen your marriage settlement was signed. I had likewise the honour of\npreparing the deed, by the wish and according to the express orders of\nMajor Har\"--\n\n\"That is sufficient,\" interrupted the Squire. \"Sir, I never burden\nladies with the wearisomeness of legal discussion.--Did you drive or\nride here, Agatha?\"\n\n\"If you remember, you sent the carriage for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--of course,\" returned the old man. \"It was a pleasant drive,\nwas it? Your husband enjoyed it too?\"\n\n\"My husband is in Cornwall\"\n\n\"Certainly. I understand.\"\n\nWhich was more than Agatha did. She could not make him out at all. The\nwandering eye, dulled with more than mere age--for it had been his pride\nthat the Harper eye always sparkled to the last; the accidental twitches\nabout the mouth, which hung loosely, and seemed unable to control its\nmuscles; above all, the extraordinary and sudden lapse of a memory\nwhich had hitherto been wonderful for his years. There was something not\nright, some hidden wheel broken or locked in the mysterious mechanism\nthat we call human life.\n\nAgatha felt uneasy. She wished Nathanael had been at home: and began to\nconsider whether some one--not herself--ought not to write and hint that\nhis father did not seem quite well.\n\nMeanwhile, she closely watched the old man, who seemed this day to show\nher more kindness and attention than ever,--there was no mistaking that.\nHe kept her constantly at his side, talking to her with marked courtesy.\nOnce she saw his eyes--those poor, dull, restless eyes, fixed on her\nwith an expression that was quite unaccountable. Going in to dinner, his\nstep, which began measured and stately, suddenly tottered. Agatha caught\nhis arm.\n\n\"You are not well--I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Grimes, who was following close behind, with the very\nreluctant Miss Mary towering over his petty head. \"No wonder that Mr.\nHarper is not quite well to-day.\"\n\nThe Squire swerved aside, like an old steed goaded by the whip, then\nrose to his full height, which was taller than either of his sons--the\nHarpers of ancient time were a lofty generation.\n\n\"Mr. Grimes, I assure you I am quite well. Will you do me the honour to\ncease your anxiety about me, and lead in my daughter to her seat?\"\n\nGrimes passed on--quenched. There was something in \"the grand old\nname of gentleman\" that threw around its owner an atmosphere in which\nplebeian intruders could not breathe.\n\n\"A person, Agatha,\" whispered the Squire, as his eyes, bright with\nsomething of their old glow, followed the evidently objectionable\nguest--\"A person to whom I show civility for the sake of--of my\nfamily.\"\n\nAgatha assented, though not quite certain to what. Scanning Mr.\nGrimes more narrowly, she faintly remembered him, and the unpleasant,\nnasal-toned voice which had gabbled through her marriage settlement. She\nwondered what he had come to Nathanael for?--why Nathanael's father paid\nhim such attention?\n\nOn her part, the sensation of dislike, unaccountable yet instinctive\ndislike, was so strong, that it would have been a real satisfaction to\nher mind if the footmen, instead of respectfully handing Mr. Grimes his\nsoup, had handed himself out at the dining-room window.\n\nThe dinner passed in grave formality. Even Mr. Grimes seemed out of\nhis element, being evidently, as Eulalie had said, \"not _quite_ a\ngentleman,\" either by birth or breeding, and lacking that something\nwhich makes the grandest gentlemen of all--Nature's. He tried now and\nthen to open a conversation with the Miss Harpers, but Eulalie sneered\nat him aside, and Mary was politely dignified. Agatha took very little\nnotice of him--her attention was absorbed by her father-in-law.\n\nMr. Harper looked old--very old. His hands, blanched to a yellowish\nwhiteness, moved about loosely and uncertainly. Once the large diamond\nmourning ring which the widower always wore, \"In memory of Catherine\nHarper,\" dropped off on the table-cloth. He did not perceive the loss\nuntil Agatha restored it, and then his fingers seemed unable to slip it\non again, until his daughter-in-law aided him. In so doing, the clammy,\nnerveless feel of the old man's hand made her start.\n\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Harper,\" he said, acknowledging her assistance with\nhis most solemn bend. \"And Catherine--Agatha, I mean, if you would be so\nkind--that is\"--\n\n\"Yes? observed Agatha, inquiringly, as he made a long pause.\n\n\"To--remind me after dinner, my dear. I have duties now--important\nduties.--My friends!\" Here he raised himself in his chair, looked round\nthe dessert-laden table with one of his old smiles, half condescending,\nhalf good-humoured, then vainly put his hand on the large claret jug,\nwhich Agatha had to lift and guide to her glass--\"My friends, I am\ndelighted to see you all. And on this happy occasion let me have the\nhonour of giving the first toast. The Reverend Frederick Harper and\nMistress Mary Harper.\"\n\nMary and Eulalie drew back. \"That is grandfather and grandmother--dead\nfifty years ago. What does papa mean?\"\n\nBut the whisper did not reach the old man, who drank the toast with\nall solemnity. Mr. Grimes did the same, repeating it loudly, with the\naddition of \"long life, health, and happiness.\" The daughters each cast\ndown strange, shocked looks upon her untouched glass. No one spoke.\n\n\"Do you make a long stay in Dorsetshire?\" observed the Squire,\naddressing himself courteously to his guest.\n\n\"That depends,\" Grimes answered, with a meaning twinkle of the eye--an\neye already growing moistened with too good wine.\n\n\"Did you not say,\" Mary Harper continued, fancying her father looked at\nher to sustain the conversation--\"did you not say you were intending to\nvisit Cornwall?\"\n\n\"No ma'am. Would rather be excused. As Mr. Harper knows, the place would\nbe too hot to hold _me_ after certain circumstances.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" The old man tried hard to gather himself up into stern dignity,\nand collect the ideas that where fast floating from him. \"Sir,\" he\nrepeated, first haughtily, and then with a violence so rare to\nhis rigidly gentlemanly demeanour that his daughters looked\nalarmed--\"Sir--at my table--before my family--I beg--I\"--Here he\nsuddenly recovered himself, changed his tone, and bowed--\"I--beg your\npardon.\"\n\n\"Oh, no offence, Squire; none meant, none taken. I came with the best\nof all intentions towards you and yours. And if things have turned out\nbadly\"--\n\n\"Did you not say you were acquainted with Cornwall?\" abruptly asked\nAgatha, to prevent his again irritating her father-in-law, who had\nleaned back, sleepily. He would not close his eyes, but they looked\nmisty and heavy, and his fingers played lazily with one another on the\narm of his chair; Agatha laid her own upon them--she could not help\nit. She lost her fear of the repellent Mr. Harper in the old man, so\nhelpless and feeble. She wished she had come oftener to Kingcombe Holm,\nand been more attentive and daughter-like to Nathanael's father.\n\n\"As to Cornwall,\" said Grimes, in a confidential whisper, \"between you\nand me, Mrs. Harper, mum's the word.\"\n\nAgatha drew herself up haughtily; but looked at the old Squire and\ngrew patient. She even tried to eke out the flagging conversation, and\nluckily remembered the news which Duke Dugdale had that morning ridden\nover to communicate. She could not help thinking it very odd that no one\nin the house had hitherto mentioned Mr. Brian Harper's expected return.\n\n\"Shall you not be very glad, Mary, to see Uncle Brian. You have heard,\nof course, how soon he will be here?\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian here!--And nobody told us. Only think, papa\"--\n\n\"My dear Mary!\" There was a gentleness in the Squire's voice more\nstartling even than his violence.\n\n\"Did you know, papa, that Uncle Brian is coming home?\"\n\n\"I think--I--Yes\"--with a struggle at recollection--\"my son-in-law told\nme that some commercial business which Brian is transacting for him will\nbring my brother home. I shall be very happy to see him. You, too, will\nall be delighted to see your Uncle Brian.\"\n\n\"An uncle? The usual rich uncle from abroad, eh?\" whispered Mr. Grimes\nto Agatha. \"I ask merely for your own sake, ma'am, and that of my friend\nNathanael.\"\n\nAgatha curled her lip. That the fellow should dare to speak of \"my\nfriend Nathanael!\" She glanced at Mary that they might leave the\ndrawing-room, when seeing her father-in-law was about to speak she\npaused.\n\nThe old Squire rose in his customary manner of giving healths. His voice\nwas quavering but loud, as if he could scarcely hear it himself, and\ntried to make it rise above a whirl of sounds that filled his brain. \"My\nfriends and children--my\"--here he looked uncertainly at Agatha--\"Yes,\nI remember, my daughter-in-law--allow me to give one toast more--Health,\nlong life, and every blessing to my son--my youngest, worthiest, _only_\nremaining son and heir, Nathanael.\"\n\n\"_Only_ son!\"--Every one recoiled. The worn-out brain had certainly\ngiven way. Mary and Eulalie exchanged frightened glances. Agatha alone,\ntouched by the unexpected tribute to her husband, did not notice the one\nmomentous word.\n\n\"Now, Squire, that's hardly fair,\" cried Mr. Grimes, bursting into a\nhoarse vinous laugh. \"A man may go wrong sometimes, but to be thrown\noverboard for it, and by one's father, too--think better of it,\nold fellow. And ladies by way of an antidote, allow me to give a\ntoast--Success to my worthy and honourable--_exceedingly_ honourable\nclient, Major Frederick Harper.\"\n\nThe old Squire leaped up in his chair, with eyes starting from their\nsockets. His lips gurgled out some inarticulate sound scarcely human;\nhis right arm shook and quivered with his vain efforts to raise it;\nstill it hung nerveless by his side. Consciousness and will yet lingered\nin his brain, but physical life and speech had gone for ever. He\nfell down struck by that living death--that worse than death, of old\nage--paralysis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nThe whole household was in terror and disorder. Eulalie had rushed\nscreaming from the room--Mary went about, trembling like a leaf, trying\nto get restoratives--Agatha knelt on the floor, supporting the old\nman's head in her lap, speaking to him sometimes, as by the motion\nand apparent intelligence of his eyes she fancied he might possibly\nunderstand her.\n\n\"Oh, he is dead, he is dead!\" cried Mary, as she took up the senseless\nhand, and let it fall again with a burst of tears.\n\n\"No, he is not dead--he hears you;--take care,\" said Agatha, putting\nthe frightened daughter aside with a firmness which rose in her, as in\nsimilar characters it does rise, equal to the necessity. She looked on\nthe trembling Mary--on the servants gathering round with silent horror,\nand saw there were none who, so to speak, \"had their wits about them,\"\nexcept herself. Scarcely knowing how she did it, she instinctively\nassumed the rule. She, the young girl of nineteen, who had never till\nthen been placed in any position of trial.\n\n\"Send all these people away. Quick Mary! Bring some one who can carry\nhim to his room. And--stay, Eulalie, sit down there and be quiet. Don't\nlet any one go and alarm Elizabeth.\"\n\nShe gave these orders and everybody listened and obeyed; people are so\nready to obey any guiding spirit at such a crisis. Then she bent down\nagain over the poor corpselike figure that rested against her knee,\nkissed the old man's forehead, and tried to comfort him. She had heard\nof cases, when though deprived of speech and motion, the sufferer was\nstill conscious of all passing around him. Therefore she wished as soon\nas possible to remove her father-in-law out of the way of the terrified\nhousehold.\n\nHe was carried to his room through the hall where he had lately trod\nso stately,--the poor old man now helpless as the dead. Leaving the\ndining-room, Agatha thought she saw his eyes turn back, as if he knew\nthat he was crossing the doorway he would never cross more, and\nwanted to take a last look at the familiar things. Otherwise he seemed\ncontinually watching herself. She walked beside him till he was\nlaid upon his bed, and then tried again to speak to him. She did it\ncaressingly, as though the old dying man had been a sick child.\n\n\"Be content, now--quite content. I will take care of you, and see that\nall is done right. I shall, not be away two minutes; I am only going to\nsend for help--your own doctor from Kingcombe. We must try to get you\nwell. Lie here quiet.\"\n\nQuiet! It was like enjoining stillness to a corpse! Agatha shuddered\nwhen she had used the word. For a moment the dread of her position rose\nupon her. In that lonely house, at night too, with no help nearer than\nKingcombe: and even then no husband, no friend--for she dared not send\nto poor, sick Anne Valery! And she so young, so inexperienced.--But\nno matter! She would try to meet everything--do everything. She felt\nalready calm and brave.\n\nThe first thing necessary was to send for medical aid. This she did;\nhaving the forethought to write a few clear lines, lest the messenger\nshould fail. She despatched word likewise to the Dugdales. She felt\nquite composed; everything right to be remembered came clearly into\nher head. It was the grand touch-stone of her character; the crisis\nof danger which shows whether a woman has that presence of mind which\nexalts her into a domestic heroine, an angel of comfort; or the weakness\nwhich sinks her into a helpless selfish fool.\n\nThe latter was hardly likely to become a true picture of Agatha Harper.\n\nShe went about with Mary, giving some orders to the servants, for\nsickness always comes startingly upon an unprepared and unaccustomed\nhouse; and tried to find a few soothing words for the terrified Eulalie,\nwho clung crying about them both, forgetting all her affectations. If\nthe Beauty had any love left in her, it was for her father. Lastly,\nAgatha took a light, and went swiftly along the passages to the distant\nwing of the house which Elizabeth occupied.\n\n\"Miss Harper,\" her maid said, \"had gone quietly to rest, and was then\nfast sleeping.\"\n\nPoor Elizabeth! this seemed the hardest point of all.\n\n\"When did she see her father?\"\n\n\"This morning. The master always comes up every morning after breakfast\nto see Miss Harper.\"\n\nAnd they would never see one another again, this helpless father and\ndaughter--never, till they met bodiless, in the next world!\n\nFor the moment Agatha felt her courage fail She glided quickly from the\ndoor, but came back again. Elizabeth had waked, and called her.\n\n\"What is the matter? I know something is the matter.\"\n\n\"Do tell her,\" whispered the maid, \"She'll find it out anyhow--she finds\nout everything. And she has been so ill all day.\"\n\nAgatha entered. There was no deceiving those eyes.\n\n\"Elizabeth, dear Elizabeth--your father--it is very hard, but--your\nfather\"--She hesitated; it was so difficult to convey, even in gentlest\nwords, the cruel truth. Miss Harper regarded her keenly. The bearer\nof ill-tidings is always soon betrayed, and Agatha's was not a face to\ndisguise anything. Elizabeth's head dropped back on the pillow.\n\n\"I perceive. He is an old man. He has gone home before me. My dear\nfather!\"\n\nThe perfect composure with which she said this astonished Agatha. She\ndid not understand how near Elizabeth always lived to the unknown world,\nand how welcome and beautiful it was in her familiar sight.\n\n\"No; he is alive still. But, if he should not come in to see you\nto-morrow-morning\"--\n\n\"I shall go unto him; he shall not return unto me,\" murmured Elizabeth,\nas her eyelids fell, and a few tears dropped through the lashes. \"Tell\nme the rest, will you?\"\n\n\"He has been seized with paralysis, I think; he cannot speak or move,\nbut seems still conscious. I do not know how it will end.\"\n\n\"One way--only one way; I feared this long. My grandfather died so.\nAgatha\"--calling after her, for she was stealing away, she could not\nbear it--\"Agatha, you will take care of him?\"\n\n\"I will as his own daughter.\"\n\n\"And, if possible\"--here Elizabeth's voice faltered a little--\"give my\nlove to my dear father.\"\n\nAgatha fled away. She hid herself in the recess close by \"Anne's\nwindow,\" as it was called, and for a minute or two cried violently.\nIt did her good. With those tears all the selfishness, anger, and pain\nflowed out of her heart, leaving it purer and more peaceful than it had\nbeen for a long time. It was not a foolish, miserable girl, but a brave,\ntenderhearted, sensible woman, who entered the door of the sick-chamber\nwhere the poor old man lay.\n\nNo one was there but the coachman who had carried his master up-stairs.\nMany servants hovered about the door, but none dared enter. Either\nthey were afraid of the Squire--afraid even now, or else the motionless\nfigure that lay within the bed-curtains was too like death. Old John sat\nbeside it, with tears running down his cheeks.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Harper, look at th' Master. He be all alive in's mind. He do\nwant bad to speak to we. Look at 'un, Missus!\"\n\n\"Give me your place, John. I will try to understand him. Father!\"--She\nfaltered a little over the word, but felt it was the right word,\nnow. The old man moved his head towards her with a feeble smile. The\nexpression of his face was clearer and more natural, only for that\nterribly painful inarticulate murmur, which no one could comprehend.\n\n\"I have done all I could think of,\" Agatha continued, speaking softly\nand cheerfully. \"The doctor will be here soon; Mary and Eulalie are\ndown-stairs. I have myself told Elizabeth that you are ill;--she is\ncomposed, and sends her love to her dear father. Was all this right?\"\n\nMr. Harper appeared to assent.\n\n\"I will sit beside you till the doctor comes, and then I will write to\nmy husband. You would like him to come home?\"\n\nHe seemed slow of comprehension, troubled, or excited. Agatha vainly\ntried to analyse the dumb expression of the features. With all her\nquickness she could not make out what he wanted. At last, a thought\nstruck her. His eldest son, his favourite--\n\n\"Would you like me to send for Major Harper?\"\n\nNo words could tell the change which convulsed the old man.\nAbhorrence--anger--fear--all were written in his countenance. He rolled\nhis head on the pillow, he struggled to gasp out something--what, his\ndaughter-in-law could not guess. She was inexpressibly shocked. One\nthing only seemed clear, that for some cause or other the mere mention\nof Frederick's name worked up the father into frenzy.\n\n\"Hush! do not try to speak. I will send for no one but Nathanael. Will\nthat content you?\"\n\nHe made a motion of satisfaction, and became quiet. His features\ngradually composed themselves, and, he sank into torpor.\n\nAgatha still sat by the bed, holding his wrist, for she knew not moment\nby moment how soon the pulse might stop. The old man's own daughters\nwere too terrified to approach him. They came on tiptoe to the door,\nlooked in, shuddered, and went back. No one stayed in the room but the\nold coachman, who had been Mr. Harper's servant since they were both\nboys; and he sat in a corner crying like a child, though silently.\nAgatha might as well have sat there quite alone, the atmosphere around\nher was so still and solemn.\n\nShe had never before been in her father-in-law's room---the state\nbedroom, in which for centuries the Harper family had been born and\ndied. The great mahogany bed itself was almost like a bier, with its\ndark velvet hangings, and dusty plumes. Everything around was dusty,\ngloomy, and worn out; the Squire would have nothing changed from the\ntime when the last Mrs. Harper died there. In a little curtained alcove\nthe lace hung yellow and dusty over her toilet-table, just as she had\nleft it when she laid herself down to the pains of motherhood and\ndeath. Her portraits--one girlish, another matronly, but still merry\nand fair--hung opposite the bed. Between them was a longitudinal\nfamily-group, in the very lowest style of art--a string of children,\nfrom the big boy to the tottering baby, in all varieties of\nimpossible attitudes. Their names were written under (not\nunnecessarily)--Frederick, Emily, Harriet, Mary, Eulalie. The only names\nmissed were Nathanael and \"poor Elizabeth.\"\n\nMechanically Agatha observed all these things during the first half-hour\nof her vigil; involuntarily her mind floated away to musings concerning\nthem, until she forcibly impelled it back to consider the present. It\nwas in vain. Innumerable conjectures flitted through her brain, but not\none which she could catch hold of as a truth. Of one thing only she felt\nsure, that something very serious must have happened--some great mental\nshock, too powerful for the Squire's feeble old age. And this shock was\ncertainly in some way or other connected with Major Harper.\n\nAn hour later, when she was beginning to count every beat of the old\nman's pulse, and look forward with dread to a midnight vigil beside that\nbreathing corpse, the doctor came.\n\nAgatha waited for his dictum--it needed very little skill to decide\nthat. A few questions--a shake of the head--a solemn condolatory sigh;\nand all knew that the old Squire's days were numbered.\n\n\"How long?\" whispered Mrs. Harper, half closing the door as they came\nout.\n\n\"I cannot say. Some hours--days--possibly a week. We never know in these\ncases. But, I fear, certainly within a week.\"\n\n_What_ would be \"within a week?\" Why is it that every one dreads to say\nthe simple word \"_die_?\"\n\nAgatha paused. She had never yet stood face to face in a house\nwith death. The sensation was very awful. She glanced within at the\nheavy-curtained bed, and then at the fair, girlish portrait which\npeered through the folds at its foot--the painted eyes, eternally young,\nseeming to keep watch smilingly. The old man and his long-parted wife,\nto be together again--\"within a week.\" It was strange--strange.\n\n\"His sons should be sent for,\" hinted the doctor. \"Mr. Locke Harper is\nin Cornwall, I believe; but the other--Major Harper\"----\n\n\"Frederick--Yes, we must send for Frederick,\" sobbed Mary. \"My father\ncares more for him than for any of us. Oh, poor Frederick!\"\n\n\"But,\" Eulalie said--they were all whispering together at the door--\"I\ndon't think any one of us, not even Elizabeth, knows Frederick's address\njust now. A week ago he was passing through London, but he does make\nsuch a mystery of his comings and goings. Oh, if he were only here!\"\n\n\"Ask my father,\" cried Mary--\"ask him if he would like to see\nFrederick.\"\n\nAs she said this rather too loudly, there was a strange smothered sound\nfrom the bed. Agatha ran. The old Squire was gasping, choking, with the\nfrightful effort to speak. His face was purple--his eyes wild--yet the\npoor bound tongue refused to obey his will.\n\n\"Hush! be composed,\" said his daughter-in-law, soothingly. \"You shall\nsee no one. No one shall be sent for. Will that do?\"\n\nHe grew calmer, but restless still.\n\n\"Shall my husband come? He will do you good--he does everybody good.\nWould you like to see Nathanael?\"\n\nA faint assent--scarcely intelligible--and then the Squire dropped\noff again into sleep. Agatha left him and went to his daughters, who\nlingered outside.\n\n\"I think Major Harper has somehow vexed him. He will only see my\nhusband. A messenger must be sent to Cornwall. Who will write?\"\n\n\"Who but yourself,\" said Eulalie, hardly able even then to repress a\nlook, beneath which Agatha's cheek glowed fiery red; \"who so fit as\nyourself to tell this to your husband?\"\n\n\"You are right;\" and she smothered down her swelling heart into a grave\ndignity. \"Get the messenger ready--I will write here--in this room.\"\n\nShe turned-within--closed the door--looked once more at the old man,\ntrying by that mournful sight to still the earthly anger that was again\nrising in her heart,--and sat down to write.\n\nIt was a hard task. She scribbled the date, and paused. This, strangely\nenough, was the first letter she had ever written to him. She did not\nknow how to begin it. Her heart beat--her fingers trembled. To tell such\nnews to the dearest friend and husband that ever woman had, would be a\ndifficult and painful thing, and for her to tell it to him, as they were\nnow! For the first letter he ever had from her to be this! And how could\nshe write it?--she who till to-day would almost have cut off her right\nhand rather than have humbled herself to write to him at all. Yet now\nall the wrath was melting out of her, and tenderness swelling up afresh.\nWe always feel so tender over those that are in trouble.\n\n\"Yes, I will do it,\" muttered Agatha. And she wrote firmly the\nwords--\"_My dear husband_\" They seemed at the same time to imprint\nthemselves on her heart as a truth--invisible sometimes, yet when\nbrought near to the fire of strong emotion or suffering, found\nineffaceably written there.\n\nThe letter was a mere brief explanation and summons; but it bore the\nwords, duty-words certainly--yet which no duty would have forced Agatha\nto write had they been untrue--\"_My dear husband_\"--\"_Your affectionate\nwife._\"\n\nShe despatched it, and re-entered the sick-room. All was quiet\nthere--the very hopelessness of the case produced quiet. There was\nnothing to be done, watched, or waited for. Doctor Mason sat by his\npatient, as he had declared his intention of doing through the night.\nHe sat mournfully, for he was a kind, good man--the family doctor for\nthirty years.\n\n\"Let all go to bed,\" he said to Agatha, seeming to understand at once\nthat she was the moving spirit in the family. \"Make the house perfectly\nquiet, and then\"--\n\n\"I will come and sit up with you.\"\n\nDoctor Mason looked compassionately at the slight girlish figure, and\nthe face already wan with the re-action after excitement. \"My dear Mrs.\nHarper, would not a servant do as well?\"\n\n\"No, I am his son's wife. What should I say to my husband if--if\nanything happened, and he not there, nor I?\"\n\n\"Good. Then stay,\" said the doctor, kindly grasping her hand. He was a\nman of few words.\n\nIt took some time and patience to quiet the house, and persuade Mary and\nEulalie to retire. When all was done, and Agatha passed swiftly, lamp in\nhand, through the dark, solitary rooms, she felt frightened. The house\nseemed so silent--already so full of death.\n\nThere was one thing more to be done--to write a line ready for Anne\nValery's waking, otherwise she would expect her home, as she had\npromised, in the early morning. How would she tell all these horrors,\neven in the gentlest way, to the feeble Anne, for whom, however\nunknown to others, and disguised by the invalid herself, Agatha felt an\never-present dread that she in vain tried to believe was only born of\nstrong attachment. We never deeply love anything for which we do not\nlikewise continually fear. Agatha almost recoiled from the idea of\nmentioning danger or death to Anne Valery.\n\nShe went into the dining-room to write. Everything there appeared\njust as when this great shock struck the household into confusion; the\ndessert was not removed--the wine in which he had drunk Nathanael's\nhealth, remained yet in Mr. Harper's glass. Agatha shrank back. She half\nexpected to see some shadowy form--not himself but Death, rise and sit\nin the arm-chair whence the old man had fallen.\n\nBrave she was, but she was still a girl, and a girl of strong\nimagination. Her heart beat audibly; she put the lamp down in the middle\nof the room, where it might cast more light, and render less ghastly the\nlast flicker of one wax-candle, the fellows of which had been left to\nburn out in their sockets. Then she sat down, covered her eyes, and\ntried to think connectedly of all that had happened this night.\n\nSomething touched her. She leaped up--would have screamed, but that\nshe remembered the room overhead--the room. She crouched down--again\ncovering her eyes.\n\nAnother touch, and a stirring in the window-curtain near which she\nsat. There was something--every one knows that horrible\nsensation--_something_ else in the room besides herself.\n\n\"Who is it?\" she said, still not looking up, frightened at her own\nvoice.\n\n\"It's me, ma'am--only me.\"\n\nEverybody in the house had forgotten Mr. Grimes.\n\nHalf-intoxicated at the time of Mr. Harper's seizure, he had stayed\nbehind in the dining-room, drunk himself stupid, and slept himself\nsober--or partly so. They say drink is a great unfolder of truth; if\nso, the old lawyer's sharp face betrayed that, in spite of all his past\ncivility, he had not the kindest feeling in the world towards the Harper\nfamily.\n\n\"So, young lady, I frightened you? You did not expect to find me here.\"\n\n\"I did not, indeed; I had quite forgotten your very existence,\" said\nMrs. Harper, point-blank. She had conceived a great dislike to Mr.\nGrimes, and Agatha was a girl who never took much trouble to disguise\nher aversions.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am. You are polite, like the rest of the Harpers. But\nwords, fair or foul, won't pay anything. Where's the Squire? He and I\nhave not yet settled the little business I came about.\"\n\n\"Mr. Grimes, perhaps you are not aware that my father-in-law is\ndangerously ill--can enter upon no business, and see no person.\"\n\n\"In-deed?\" His thorough insolence of manner brought Agatha's dignity\nback. She remembered that she was a lady belonging to the house, and\nthat this fellow, whose behaviour made his grey hairs so little worthy\nof respect, was her father-in-law's invited guest.\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, drawing up her little figure, and trying to look as\nmuch Mrs. Locke Harper as possible, \"you must be aware that in the\npresent state of the house a stranger's presence is undesirable. It is\nnot too late to order the carriage. Will you favour me by going to sleep\nat Kingcombe?\"\n\nMr. Grimes looked disposed to object; but she had her hand on the bell,\nand her manner, though perfectly civil, was resolute--so resolute, that\nhe became humble.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Harper, I'm willing to oblige a former client, but I should\nlike to put to you a few questions before leaving.\"\n\n\"Put them.\"\n\n\"First--what's wrong with the old gentleman?\"\n\n\"He has had a paralytic stroke--probably caused, the doctor says, by\nsome great shock, which was too much for him, being an old man.\"\n\nThe other old man looked uneasy, as though some touch of nature smote\nhim for the moment.\n\n\"You don't think\"--here he crept backward, shambling and cowardly--\"you\ndon't think I had any hand in causing this--this very melancholy\noccurrence.\"\n\n\"You?\" There was undisguised scorn in Agatha's lip. As if any Mr. Grimes\ncould do harm to a Harper! \"Nothing of the kind--pray do not disquiet\nyour conscience unnecessarily.\"\n\n\"But I did bring him unpleasant news, for which I'm rather sorry now.\nI had much better have told his son. When shall I be likely to see my\nfriend Nathanael?\"\n\nHis friend Nathanael! Agatha could have crushed him and stamped upon\nhim, had he been worth it.\n\n\"Mr. Locke Harper,\" she said, trying hard to keep her temper--\"Mr. Locke\nHarper will be at home to-morrow night. You can then make to him any\ncommunications you please. At the present, the greatest benefit you can\nconfer on this sad house is to absent yourself from it.\"\n\n\"'Pon my life, Mrs. Harper, you might waste a little more breath on me,\nlest I might think it worth while to spend a little too much breath on\nyou and yours. Do you know what claim I have upon your family?\"\n\n\"That of being Major Harper's lawyer, I believe, and possibly mine\nbefore my marriage. It is not likely that my husband has continued to\nuse your services afterwards.\"\n\nAgatha said this sharply, for she was annoyed to feel herself in such\ntotal darkness regarding her husband's affairs. For a moment she felt\nhalf alarmed at the expression, \"My friend Nathanael.\" Could they be\nallied, he and this disagreeable man? Could Grimes have acquired any\npower over him, that he was smiling in such a sinister, mysterious way?\n\n\"My services? Really, Mrs. Harper, this is very amusing. You surely must\nbe aware that your husband has not the slightest occasion for anybody's\nservices in the management of his affairs. One can't make something out\nof nothing, and when there is not a halfpenny left\"--\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"My dear young lady, is it possible you don't know the unfortunate\ncircumstance, at least one of the unfortunate circumstances which\nbrought me here? Why, Mr. Locke Harper knew it months ago. He and I had\nseveral conferences together on the subject. But we husbands are\nobliged to be uncommunicative, as my wife would tell you, if you had the\npleasure of knowing Mrs. Grimes\"--\n\n\"Will you keep to the point, sir?\" said Agatha, sternly. She felt\nvery stern--very bitter. The old wound was reopening sorer than ever.\nNathanael had \"held conferences\" with this fellow--confided to him\nsecrets which he had not told to her--his own wife! Here was a new\npang--a new indignity. In its sharpness she forgot everything else; even\nthe silent room overhead. She had just self-possession and pride enough\nnot to question; she would have been more than human had she not paused\nto hear.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Grimes!\" she said, confronting him, her hand still on the\ndoor, where she had placed it as a mute signal which he refused to\nunderstand.\n\n\"I own, Mrs. Harper, it is a hard case. At the time I really felt as\nsorry for you as if you had been my own daughter. All to happen so soon\nafter your marriage, too! Some persons might blame me for consenting to\nkeep back the facts, but I assure you Major Harper compelled me to draw\nup the settlement exactly according to his orders.\"\n\n\"Sir--will you hasten--my time is occupied.\"\n\n\"So is mine, madam; fully occupied. I shall waste no more of it in\ngiving advice to young women who are as proud as peacocks, and as poor\nas church-mice. If it wasn't for that highly respectable young man, your\nhusband, I should say it served you right.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Agatha, beneath her breath.\n\n\"Mr. Locke Harper found out, a month after his marriage, that somebody\nhad made ducks and drakes of all his wife's property. So, as I hear,\nthe poor young man has had to turn land-steward just to keep his kitchen\nfire burning. That's all. Very odd you don't know it.\"\n\n\"I do now.\"\n\n\"Well, you take it quietly enough. You seem quite satisfied.\"\n\n\"I am so.\"\n\nMr. Grimes regarded her in perfect bewilderment. She showed no token of\ndismay or grief, but stood calmly by the open door.\n\n\"I'm not satisfied though,\" cried he, at last growing heated--\"I'm\nnot going to have shareholders coming down upon me, and be hunted from\nLondon and from my profession, just because Major Harper\"--\n\n\"I would rather not hear of Major Harper, or any one else, to-night.\nOnce more--will you oblige me by leaving?\"\n\nHer thorough self-possession, her air of command--controlled the man in\nspite of himself. He moved away, bidding her a civil good-night.\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Grimes; I will light you to the door.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" He gave a grunt--seemed inclined to hesitate--looked up at Mrs.\nHarper, and--obeyed.\n\nAgatha came slowly back through the hall, feeling all stunned and\nstupified. She sat down, smoothed her hair back with her hands, heaved\none or two weary sighs, and tried to think what had happened to her.\n\n\"So, I am no heiress. I have lost all my money, and am quite poor. He\nknows it--knew it a long time ago, and did not tell me. Why did he not\ntell me, I wonder?\"\n\nHere was a pause. For a moment she felt inclined to doubt the fact\nitself; truthful people have little suspicion of chicanery or falsehood,\nand when she came to think, innumerable circumstances confirmed Grime's\nstatement. Yes, it must be true. This, then, was Nathanael's secret. Why\nhad he kept it from her.\n\n\"As if he thought I cared for money! As if\"--and a choking filled her\nthroat--\"as if I would have minded being ever so poor did he only love\nme!\"\n\nThe thought burst out naturally, like water forcing its way through\nmuddy reeds--showing how, deep down, there lay the living spring.\n\n\"Now, let me consider. He must have had some strong reason for keeping\nthis secret. It cost him much; he said so. But I never heeded that.\nHow I wearied him about not taking the house; how angry I was at his\nacceptance of the stewardship. And it was for me he wished to toil--for\nme, and for our daily bread! Yet he would not tell me. And all the while\nhe must have had numberless cares and anxieties without, and his\nown wife blindly tormenting him at home. Last of all I called him\n_mercenary_. And what did he answer? Nothing! Not one reproach--not one\nword of anger. Yet still--he kept his secret Why?\"\n\nHere she paused again. All was mystery.\n\n\"It might have been through tenderness--to save me pain. Yet no--for he\ncould not but see how his silence stung me. Then since he kept not this\nsecret for love of me--and I am hardly worth such loving--it must have\nbeen from some motive, perhaps higher than love--some bond of honour\nwhich he could not break. Did he not say something to that effect once?\nLet me think.\"\n\nAgain she sat down, and so far as her excited feelings would allow,\ntried to recall the story of their acquaintance, courtship, marriage--a\nsix-month's tale--how brief, yet how full. Amidst its confusion,\namidst all the variations of her own feelings, stood out one steadfast\nimage--her husband.\n\nHis character was peculiar--very peculiar. Its strength, reticence,\npower of silentness and self-control were beyond her comprehension;\nbut its uprightness, truth, and rigid immaculate honour--she could\nunderstand those. It must have been his sense of honour and moral\nright that in some way impelled this concealment, even at the hazard of\nwounding the wife he loved--if he ever had loved her.\n\nFor a minute or so Agatha's mind almost lost its balance, rocking on\nthis one point of torture--then it settled. \"_God knows I did love\nyou, Agatha_.\" He had said so--he who never uttered a falsehood. It was\nenough.\n\n\"Yet he '_did_' love me; that means he does not now. I have wearied\nhim out with my folly, my coldness, and at length with that one last\ninsulting wrong. I--to tell him he 'married me for my money'--when all\nthe while I was a beggar on his hands! Yet he never betrayed a word. Oh,\nno wonder he despises me. No wonder he has ceased loving me. He never\ncan love me any more.\"\n\nShe burst into a passion of tears, and so remained for long. At last a\nsudden thought seemed to dart through her sorrow. She leaped upright,\nclasping her hands above her head in the rapturous attitude of a child.\n\n\"There is a better thing than love--goodness. And whether he loves me or\nnot, he is all good in himself. I know that now. It is I only that have\nbeen wicked, and have lost him. No matter. Anne was right. My noble\nhusband! I would not give my faith in him even for his love for me!\"\n\nShe said this in a delirium of joy--a woman's pure joy, when she can set\naside the selfish craving for love, and live only in the worthiness of\nthe object beloved. It was beautiful to see Agatha as she stood, her\nfeatures and form all radiant. One person, creeping in, did see her.\n\nOld John the coachman, stood in the doorway with his mournful face.\n\nAgatha awoke to realities. Death all but present in the\nhouse--misfortune following--and she had given way to that burst of joy!\n\nShe drew her hand across her forehead--sat down at the table--wrote the\nthree lines she had intended to Anne Valery, and then went her way, to\nwatch all night long beside her husband's father.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nA night and a day had passed, and the household had grown somewhat\naccustomed to the cloud that hung over it. It was but natural. How soon\ndo most families settle themselves after a great shock!--how easily-does\nany grief become familiar and bearable! Likewise, saddest thought\nof all--how seldom is any one really missed from among us, painfully\nmissed, for longer than a few days--a few hours!\n\nBy evening, when all Kingcombe was yet talking over the \"shocking event\"\nat Kingcombe Holm, the \"afflicted family\" had subsided into its usual\nways--a little more grave perhaps, but still composed. Some voluble\nfresh grief arose when Anne Valery came--Anne, ever foremost in entering\nthe house of mourning--and took her place among the daughters of the\nfamily, ready to give sympathy, counsel, and comfort. It was all she was\nstrong enough to do now. The chief position in the household was still\nleft to Agatha.\n\nDr. Mason gave his directions and went away. There was nothing more to\nbe done or hoped for. The form which lay in the Squire's bedroom might\nlie there for days, weeks, months--without change. The old coachman and\nhis wife watched their master alternately; but he took little notice\nof them. In every conscious moment his whole attention was fixed upon\nAgatha. His eyes followed her about the room; when she talked to him he\nfeebly smiled. She could not imagine why this should be, but she felt\nglad. It was so sweet to know herself in any way a comfort to the father\nof Nathanael.\n\nShe sat for hours by the old man's bedside, trying to think of nothing\nbut him. What were all these worldly things, loss of fortune or youth,\nor even love itself, to the spirit that lay on the verge of a closed\nlife--passing swiftly into eternity?\n\nSo she sat and strove to forget all that had happened, or was happening\nto herself; ay, though every now and then she would start, fancying\nthere was a voice in the hall, or a step at the door. And she would\nhesitate whether to run away and hide herself from her husband's\npresence or wait and let him find her in her right place--beside his\ndying father.\n\nAnd then--how would he meet her? how look--how speak? Yet these\nconjectures were selfish. Most likely he would scarcely notice her--his\nheart would be so full of other thoughts. What right had she, his erring\nwife, to obtrude herself upon his feelings at such a time? She could\nonly look at him, and watch him, and silently help him in everything.\nAlas, she might not even dare to comfort him!\n\nTowards evening the suspense of expectation grew less, from the mere\nfact of its having lasted so many hours. Agatha went down in the course\nof dinner. The dining-table looked as usual, only fuller, from the\npresence of the Dugdales and Miss Valery. Mary had of necessity taken\nher father's place, but not his chair--it was put aside against the\nwall, and nobody looked that way.\n\nAgatha seated herself next to Miss Valery, quietly--they were all so\nvery quiet. Anne whispered, \"How is he?\" and the rest listened for the\nanswer--the usual answer, which all foreboded. Then Harriet made an\nattempt to speak of other things--of how the rain pattered against the\nwindow-panes, and what an ill night it was for Nathanael's journey. She\neven began to doubt whether he would come.\n\n\"He is sure to come,\" said Miss Valery.\n\nAnd while she was yet speaking there swept round the house a wild burst\nof storm, in the midst of which were faintly discerned the sound of a\nhorse's feet. They all cried out--\"He is here!\"\n\nA minute more and he was in the room--drenched through--flushed with\nriding against wind and rain. But it was himself, his own self, and his\nwife saw him.\n\nWhen those who are much thought of return from absence, for the first\nminute they almost always seem unlike the image in our hearts.--It\nwas not thus that Agatha had remembered her husband. Not thus--abrupt,\nagitated: anything but the calm and grave Nathanael.\n\nHe looked eagerly round the room--all rose: but Miss Valery was the\nfirst to take his hand.\n\n\"Thanks, Anne, I knew you would be with them. Is he\"--\n\n\"Just the same--no change.\"\n\nThe young man breathed hard. \"Are you all here?\" He took his three\nsisters and kissed them one after the other, silently, brotherly--Anne\nlikewise. There was one left out--his wife, who had hidden behind the\nrest. But soon she heard her name.\n\n\"Is Agatha with you?\"\n\nShe approached. Her husband took her hand--paused a moment--and then\ntouched her cheek with his lips, as he had done to his sisters. He did\nnot look at her or speak--it seemed as if he were not able.\n\nThey drew round Nathanael, nearly all weeping. There was, as is natural\nat such times, an unusual outburst of family tenderness. And, as was\nnatural also, no one seemed to think of the young wife--the stranger in\nthe circle. Agatha slid away from the group and disappeared.\n\nShortly after, she had taken her usual place in the sickroom. It had\nstruck her that the old man ought to be prepared for his son's coming,\nso she had at once proceeded to his bedside. But it was useless--he was\nsleeping. She sat down noiselessly in her old seat, and watched, as she\nhad done for many an hour in this long day, the smiling portrait at the\nfoot of the bed--her husband's mother, whom he never saw.\n\nWhile she sat, footsteps entered the room. Agatha turned quickly round\nto motion the intruder to silence, and perceived that it was Nathanael.\n\nShe fancied--nay, was sure--that he started when he saw her. Still, he\ncame forward. She rose, and would have given him her seat, but he put\nhis hand on her shoulder, and gently pressed her down again. The old\nservant who watched near her went respectfully to the further end of the\nroom.\n\nIt was a solemn scene; the dim light--the total silence, broken only by\nthe feeble breathing of the old man, who lay passive as death, without\ndeath's sanctity of calm. Over all, that gay youthful portrait which\nthe lamp-light, excluded from the bed, kindled into wonderfully vivid\nlife--far more like life than the sleeper below.\n\nThe young man stood mournfully watching his father, until startled by\na flash of fire-light on the canvas, his eyes wandered to the painted\nsmile of his unknown mother, and then turned back again to the\npillows--the same pillows where she died.. His fingers began to twitch\nnervously, though his features remained still. Slowly, Agatha saw large\ntears rise and roll down his cheeks. Her heart yearned over her\nhusband, but she dared not speak. She could but weep--not outwardly, but\ninwardly, with exceeding bitter pangs.\n\nAt length the old man stirred. Agatha remembered her duty as nurse, and\nhastily whispered her husband:\n\n\"I think you should move aside for a minute. Don't let him see you\nsuddenly--it will startle him.\"\n\n\"That is thoughtful of you. But who will tell him?\"\n\n\"I will--he is used to me. Are you awake, father?\"\n\nNathanael caught the word, and looked surprised.\n\n\"Dear father,\" she continued, soothingly, \"will you not try to wake now?\nHere is some one come to see you--some one you will be glad to see.\"\n\nThe Squire's eyes grew wild; he uttered a thick, painful murmur.\n\n\"Some one who was sure to come when he knew you were ill--your son.\"\nShe paused, shocked at the frenzied expression of the old man's face.\n\"Nay--your younger son--Nathanael--may he come?\"\n\nShe perceived some faint assent, beckoned to her husband, saw him take\nher place at the bedside, and then stole away, leaving the son alone\nwith his father.\n\nAgatha rejoined the rest of the family. They were all sitting talking\ntogether as Nathanael had left them. After her leaving, they said, he\nhad hardly spoken at all, but had gone up directly after her.\n\nIn about half-an-hour he re-appeared--greatly agitated. His sisters all\nturned to him as he entered, but he avoided their eyes. Agatha never\nlifted hers; she sat in a dim corner behind Miss Valery.\n\n\"What do you think of him, Nathanael?\" asked Mary, in a low voice.\n\n\"I cannot yet tell; I want to hear how he was seized. Which of you saw\nmost of him yesterday?\"\n\n\"No one, unless it was Agatha. He was shut up in his study until she\ncame.\"\n\n\"And who has been most with him since?\"\n\n\"Agatha.\"\n\nA soft expression dawned in the young man's eyes as they sought the dim\ncorner.\n\n\"Will Agatha tell me what _she_ thinks of my father's state?\"\n\nThis appeal, so direct--so unexpected--could not be gainsaid.\n\nYet, when Nathanael addressed her, Agatha's agitation was so visible\nthat it attracted observation--especially Mrs. Dugdale's.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said Harrie, compassionately, \"how pale she looks!\"\n\n\"No wonder,\" Mary added. \"She is more worn out than any of us. She sat\nup all last night.\"\n\nNathanael's eyes were on his wife again, full of ineffable gentleness.\n\"Agatha, come over and rest in this armchair. I want to talk to you\nabout my father.\"\n\nShe obeyed. He spoke in a low voice:\n\n\"I feel deeply your having been so kind to him.\"\n\n\"It was right. I was glad to do it.\"\n\n\"What do you think caused his illness?\"\n\n\"Doctor Mason said it was probably some severe mental shock.\"\n\nNathanael looked alarmed. \"Indeed! and did the rest of the family know\nanything?--guess anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nHer husband fixed on her a penetrating gaze; she returned it steadily.\n\n\"Agatha,\" he hurriedly said, \"you are a sensible girl--more so than any\nof my sisters. I want to consult with you alone. Come and walk up and\ndown the room with me where they cannot overhear us.\"\n\nShe did so. How strange it was!\n\n\"Do you think my father had any sudden ill news? Did he see any person\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"A stranger came to him. Your brother's lawyer, Mr. Grimes.\"\n\n\"Grimes? Oh, my poor father!\"\n\nHe sat down abruptly. Agatha wondered at his mingling the two names.\nWhat should Grimes have to do with his father?\n\n\"Did any one else see Grimes?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"What did he say to you? Was it\"--he dropped his head, and spoke half\ninaudibly--\"Was it anything about my brother?\"\n\nAgatha marvelled, even with a sort of pain. Father, brother, every one\nbefore her! \"He never named Major Harper, that I can remember. But he\nsaid\"--\n\n\"What?\"\n\nAgatha drew back. How could she speak of such petty things as money and\nfortune then! She answered softly, and with a full heart:\n\n\"Never mind. It was a mere trifle, not worth telling, or even thinking\nof now. Another time.\"\n\nNathanael regarded his wife doubtfully, but she bore the look. She was\nspeaking the simple truth. Loss of fortune did seem \"a mere trifle\" now,\nwhen he was safe back again, and she sat in his presence, he talking to\nher as gently as in the olden time. Her simplicity in worldly things\nwas so extreme that even Nathanael passed it over as impossible. He only\nsaid:\n\n\"Well, all must come out ere long. We cannot think of it now. Tell me\nmore about my poor father.\"\n\n\"There is little more to tell. His manner was rather strange, I thought,\nall dinner-time. He drank healths as usual--especially yours. His mind\nwas wandering then, for he called you his _only_ son. Then Mr. Grimes\ngave another toast--Major Harper. At that moment your father fell from\nhis chair.\"\n\nNathanael started up--\"I knew it would be so. He could not bear such\nshame--my poor old father!\"\n\n\"Nathanael,\" cried Harrie, from the fireside group, \"come and give us\nyour opinion. I say that he ought to be sent for at once.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Frederick\"\n\nNathanael cried out violently, as if self-control were no longer\npossible.\n\n\"Never! Here have I used every effort, smothered every feeling, made\nevery sacrifice, to save my poor father from knowing all this--and in\nvain! You may talk as you like, but I say Frederick shall never enter\nthese doors. He is as good as his father's murderer.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" cried Anne Valery, going to him while the others stood aghast.\nShe only knew what fearful storms can be roused in these quiet natures.\n\n\"I will not hush. I have been silent too long over his wrong-doing.\"\n\n\"But some\"--breathed Anne scarce audibly--\"some whom he wronged have\nbeen silent for a lifetime.\"\n\nNathanael paused; Anne's reasoning was from facts unknown to him; but he\nsaw the agony in her face. She continued in a whisper:\n\n\"Be slow to judge him, if only for his sisters' sakes--his dead\nmother's--the honour of the family.\"\n\n\"I have thought only too much of all these things.\"\n\n\"Then, for his father's sake--his father, who is going away to the\nother world leaving a son unforgiven. Beware how you not only take your\nbrother's birthright, but seal your brother's curse.\"\n\n\"God forbid. Oh, Anne--Anne!\"\n\nHe pressed his hand over his eyes, and leaned back a moment--leaning,\nthough he did not know it, against his wife, who had stolen behind his\nchair. No one else came near; they all shrank from their brother as if\nhe were suddenly gone mad. Looking up, he saw only Miss Valery.\n\n\"Forgive me, Anne; I cannot control myself as I used to do: I have been\nvery ill lately, but don't tell my wife.\"\n\nAnne took no notice; perhaps she wished the wife should learn the\nhusband's real heart as she--his old friend--knew it.\n\n\"Don't think I would harm Frederick. Not for worlds. Do you know,\" and\nhis voice lowered, \"I dare not trust myself even to be just over his\nmisdeeds, lest I should be slaying my enemy.\"\n\n\"Your enemy? It is too hard a word.\"\n\n\"No! it is true.\" He glanced round, perceiving no one near but Miss\nValery. \"Anne,\" he whispered, \"do you remember the parable of Nathan?\nWhy did he do it--the cruel rich man who had enjoyed so much all his\nlife? Why did he steal my one little ewe-lamb?\"\n\n\"Stay!\" cried Anne, with a sudden suspicion waking in her. \"I don't\nclearly understand. Tell me again.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he said recovering himself. \"I have nothing to tell--But we\nare wasting time. Anne, it shall be as you say.\" And he drew a long hard\nbreath. \"Which of us had best write to my brother?\"\n\nRising, he found out who had been behind him. He looked horrified.\n\n\"Agatha!--did you overhear me?\"\n\nThe suspicion wounded her to the core. Her pride and sense of justice\nwere alike roused.\n\n\"Have no fear, Mr. Harper,\" said she; \"I shall not betray your secrets.\nI do not even comprehend them; except that I think it very wicked for\nbrothers to be such enemies.\"\n\nHe made no answer.\n\n\"And,\" continued Agatha, growing bolder, as she was prone to do on the\nside of the mysteriously wronged, \"I would have sent for Major Harper\nmyself, had not your father seemed unwilling. But the eldest son ought\nto be here.\"\n\n\"He shall be--your husband will write,\" interposed Miss Valery.\n\nThe husband moved away. He had thoroughly frozen up again into the\nNathanael of old, whose coldness jarred against every ardent impulse of\nAgatha's temperament--rousing, irritating her into opposition.\n\n\"There is no need for him to trouble himself. What was right to be done\nhas luckily not waited for _his_ doing it. Elizabeth herself informed\nher brother.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"This afternoon. I sent the letter myself to Mr. Trenchard's, where I\nfound out he had been staying.\"\n\nAs Mrs. Harper said this, her husband's eyes literally glared.\n\n\"You knew where he was staying?--Agatha--Agatha?\"\n\nBut Agatha's look was fixed on the door, to which her sisters-in-law had\ngathered hastily. There was a talking outside--a welcome as it seemed.\nShe forgot everything except her sense of right and justice to one\nunwarrantably and unaccountably blamed.\n\n\"It is surely he,\" she cried, and ran eagerly forward.\n\n\"Nathanael!\"\n\n\"Frederick!\"\n\nThe two brothers, elder and younger, stood confronting each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\"Elizabeth sent for me--Elizabeth only showed me that kindness. Oh, it\nwas very cruel of you all--you should have told me my father was dying.\"\n\nIt must have been a hard heart that could have closed itself altogether\nagainst Frederick Harper now.\n\nHe leant against the doorway, the miserable ghost of his gay self. Born\nonly for summer weather, on him any real blast of remorse or misfortune\nfell suddenly, entirely, overthrowing the whole man.\n\n\"Elizabeth says it happened yesterday; and must have been\nbecause--because Grimes--Oh, God forgive me! it is I that have killed my\nfather!\"\n\nEvery one shrank back. None of his sisters understood what he meant; but\nthe mere expression seemed to draw a line of demarcation between them\nand the self-convicted man. Agatha only approached him--she felt so very\nsorry for her old friend.\n\n\"You must not talk in this way, Major Harper. If you did vex him in any\nway, it is very sad; but he will forgive you now. You cannot have done\nany real harm to your father.\"\n\nHer kind voice, her perfectly guileless manner, struck each of the\nbrothers with various emotion. The eyes of both met on her face:\nFrederick dropped his, and groaned; Nathanael's brightened. For the\nfirst time he addressed his brother:\n\n\"Frederick, she is right; you must not talk thus. Compose yourself.\"\n\nIt was in vain; his easy temperament was plunged into depths of childish\nweakness. \"Oh, what have I done? You said truly, it would kill him to\nhear _that_. And my heedlessness drove Grimes to go and tell him. Yes,\nyour prophecy was true: I have been the disgrace of our house--the\ndestruction of my father. What shall I do, Nathanael?\"\n\nAnd he held out his hands to his younger brother in the helplessness of\ndespair.\n\n\"The first thing, Frederick, is for you to be silent Anne, take my\nsisters away; my brother and I have something to say to one another.\nWhat? no one will go? Then, brother, come with me.\"\n\nThe other rose mechanically; Agatha likewise. She began to put\ncircumstances together, and guess darkly at what was amiss. Probably she\nherself had to do with it. She remembered in what strict honour the\nold Squire held the duty of a guardian, as he had shown in what he said\nabout his own relation to Anne Valery. Perhaps some carelessness of his\nson's had caused her own loss of fortune. Yet that was not a thing to\nbreak his father's heart, or harden his brother's against him. Mere\nchance it must have been; ill-luck, or at the worst carelessness. There\ncould not be any real dishonour in Major Harper. And after all what was\nmoney, when they could be so much happier without it? She determined to\ngo to her husband and openly say so, telling all that had come to her\nknowledge of their secrets. They should no longer be angry with one\nanother--if it were on her account.\n\nSo she followed after them, with her soft, noiseless step; and when the\ntwo brothers stood together in their father's deserted study, there she\nwas between them.\n\n\"Agatha!\" They both uttered her name--the elder in much confusion. He\nhad seemed all along as though he could scarcely bear the sight of her\ninnocent face.\n\n\"Don't send me away,\" she said, laying a hand on either. \"I know I am\na young ignorant thing, and you are wise men; but perhaps a\nstraightforward girl may be as wise as you. Why are you angry with one\nanother?\"\n\nBoth looked uncomfortable. Major Harper tried to throw the question off.\n\n\"Are we angry with one another? Nay, I am sure\"--\n\n\"Don't deceive me--this is no time for making pretences of any kind.\nWhat is this quarrel between you two?\" And she turned from one to the\nother her fearless eyes.\n\nMajor Harper could not meet them; Nathanael did, calmly, but\nsorrowfully.\n\n\"Agatha, I cannot tell you.\"\n\n\"But I can tell _you_; and I will, for it is right. Major Harper, do not\nbe unhappy. Believe me, I care not one jot for all the money I ever\nhad. If you have lost it, I am sure it was accidentally. You would not\nwilfully wrong me of a straw.\"\n\nAgain Major Harper groaned. Nathanael stood speechless with amazement.\nAt length he said, very gently:\n\n\"How did you find this out, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Mr. Grimes told me.\"\n\n\"Was that all he told?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMajor Harper looked relieved. Nathanael watched him sternly. After a\nwhile he said:\n\n\"Frederick, this is the right time to explain all. Do not start; you\nneed not fear _me_; in any case I shall hold to my promise. But if you\nwould explain--for my sake, for others' sake\"--\n\nThe other shrank away. \"No, not now,\" he whispered; \"oh! brother, not\nnow. Give me a little time. Don't disgrace me before her--before them\nall.\"\n\nNathanael's stature rose. Without again speaking, he shook his brother's\nhand from off his shoulder with a gesture, slight yet full of meaning,\nand turned towards Agatha. He seemed to yearn over her, though he\nchecked every expression of feeling except the softness of his voice.\n\n\"I am glad you have found out we are poor--that in some things my wife\nmay see I have not been so cruel to her as she thought.\"\n\nAgatha's cheeks crimsoned with emotion. Why--why were they not alone\nthat she need not have smothered it down, and stood so quiet that he\nbelieved she did not feel? He went on, rather more sadly:\n\n\"But this is not a time to talk of our own affairs; you shall know all\nere long. Will you be content until then?\" And he held out his hand.\n\nShe took it, looking eagerly into his face. There was something there\nso intrinsically noble and true! Though his conduct yet seemed\nstrange--unreasonable towards her, harsh towards his brother, still,\nin defiance of all, there was that in his countenance which compelled\nfaith. And there was that in her own heart, a something neither reason\nnor conviction, but transcending both, which leaped to him as through\nintervening darkness light leaps to light. She felt that she must\nbelieve in her husband.\n\nHe seemed partly to understand this, and smiled--a pale, faint smile,\nthat quickly vanished.\n\n\"Now, Agatha,\" he said, opening the door for her, \"go and see how my\nfather is, and then you must go to bed. I will sit up with him to-night.\nI cannot have my poor wife killing herself with watching.\"\n\nHis voice sunk tenderly; he even put out his hand, as if to stroke her\nhair after his old habit, but drew it back--Major Harper was looking on.\nAgain the dark fire, lit so fatally on his marriage-day, and since then\nsometimes fiercely raging, sometimes smothered down to a mere spark,\nyet never wholly extinguished, rose up in the young man's strong,\nself-contained, strangely silent heart. Would his pride never let it\nburst forth, that, mingling with the common air, it might burn itself to\nnothingness! But how many a whole life has been tortured and consumed\nby just such a little flame, a mere spark, let fall by some evil tongue\nwhich is set on fire of hell.\n\nWhile they paused--the wife waiting, she knew not for what, except that\nit seemed so easy to follow and so hard to quit her husband--there was a\ncry heard on the staircase at the foot of which they stood. Mrs. Dugdale\ncame running down in terror.\n\n\"Nathanael--Agatha--I have told my father that Fred is here. Oh, come to\nhim, do come!\"\n\nNo time for pitiful earthly passions, jealousies, and regrets. Nathanael\nran quick as lightning, his wife following. But at the door of the\nsick-room even she recoiled.\n\nThe old man sat up in bed, raised on pillows; either the paralysis\nhad not been so entire as was at first supposed, or he had slightly\nrecovered from it. His right arm moved feebly; his tongue was loosed,\nthough only in a half-intelligible jabber. But his countenance showed\nthat, however lay the miserable body, the poor old man was in his right\nmind. Alas! that mind was not at peace, not lighted with the holy glow\ncast on the dying by the world to come, It was filled with rage and\ntorment.\n\nNathanael ran to him, \"Father, father, you will destroy yourself. What\nis it you want?\"\n\nThe answer was unintelligible to his son, but Agatha gathered from it\nthat the chamber-door was to be shut and bolted. She did so; yet even\nthen the sick man's fury scarce abated. Broken words--curses that the\nhelpless lips refused to ratify; terrible outbursts of wrath, mingled\nwith the piteous moan of senility. Last of all came the name, once given\nproudly by the young father to his first-born, and now gasped out with\nmaledictions from the same father's dying lips--\"Frederick.\"\n\nNathanael and Agatha looked at one another with horror. They both knew\nthat the old Squire was bent on driving from his death-bed his own, his\nfirst-born son.\n\nAgatha instinctively held down the palsied hands, which were trying to\nlift themselves towards heaven--not in prayers!\n\n\"Father, don't say--don't even think such terrible things. Whatever he\nhas done, forgive him!--for the love of God, forgive him!\"\n\nThe old man regarded her, and his excitement seemed redoubled. Agatha\nfancied it was the father's pride, dreading lest she, a stranger, knew\nthe cause of his anger.\n\n\"No, no!\" she cried, \"I scarcely understand anything; my husband would\nnot tell me. Whatever has happened can all be hushed up. We would\nforgive anything to a brother--oh, would we not?\" And she appealed to\nNathanael, who stood motionless, great drops lying on his forehead,\nthough his features were so still.\n\n\"It is true, father,\" he whispered. \"No one knows anything but me, and I\nhave kept your honour safe that he might redeem it some time. Perhaps he\nmay. And remember, he is your son--the first-born of his mother. Hush,\nAgatha!\" Nathanael continued, as he saw a sudden change come over\nthe old man's face. \"Don't say any more now. Leave me to talk with my\nfather.\"\n\nWith the grave tenderness that he always showed her, he took his wife by\nthe hand, led her to the door, and closed it. Greatly moved, yet\nfeeling satisfied he would do what was right, Agatha obeyed and went\ndown-stairs.\n\nThe sisters and brother were assembled in the study. Marmaduke was there\ntoo, but took little part in the family lamentation, except in keeping a\nperpetual tender watch over the grief of his own Harrie. Anne Valery was\nabsent.\n\nFrederick Harper sat apart. A sullen gloom had succeeded to his\nmisery--with him no feeling ever lasted long, at least in the same form.\nHarriet and Eulalie were inspecting with great curiosity their elder\nbrother, whose presence among his long-estranged household seemed\naccompanied with such a mysterious discomfort. They eyed him doubtfully,\nas if he had done something very wrong that nobody knew of. Mary only,\nwho was next eldest to himself, ventured to address some kind words, and\nbestir herself about his comfort.\n\nThus the family sat, Agatha among them, for more than an hour. No one\nthought of going to bed. All remained together, in a strangely quiet,\nsubdued state, Major Harper being with them all the time, though he\nhardly spoke, or they to him. He seemed a stranger in his father's\nhouse.\n\nOnce when he had gone for a few minutes to Elizabeth's room--he had been\nwith Elizabeth long before his coming was known to any of the rest, it\nwas believed--Mary began in her lengthy wandering way to tell anecdotes\nof his boyish doings; how handsome he was, and how naughty too; and\nhow, when he got into disgrace, she, by the scheming of Elizabeth, used\nsecretly to carry bread-and-honey and apples to his bedroom. And she\nwiped her eyes, the good, plain-looking sister Mary, saying over and\nover again,\n\n\"Poor Fred!\" She never thought of him, like the world, as \"Major\nFrederick Harper,\" but only as \"Poor Fred!\"\n\nSeveral times Agatha stole up-stairs to the door of the room which\nenclosed the sorrow-mystery of the house. It was always shut, but she\ncould hear Nathanael's voice within--his soft, kind voice, talking\nquietly by the bedside.\n\n\"I never see anything like 'un,\" said the coachman's wife, who sat\nwithout the door. \"He do manage th' Squire just as the poor dear\nMissus did. He do talk just like his mother.\" And that was evidently the\nperfection of everything in the old woman's eyes.\n\nAgatha sat down beside her on the staircase, listening to the wind\nwithout, that swept fiercely over the hollow in which Kingcombe Holm\nlay, as if ready to bear away on its pinions a departing soul. It was\nan awful night to die in. Agatha listened, sensitive to every one of its\nterrors. But above them all--above the shadow of coming death, fear of\nthe future, anxiety in the present--rose one thought--the thought of her\nhusband.\n\nIt gave her no pain--it gave her no joy--yet there it was, a visible\nimage sitting strong and calm in the half-lighted chamber of her heart,\nevery feeling of which crept to its feet and lay there, like priestesses\nin the twilight before a veiled god.\n\nNathanael at last opened the door. He looked like one who has struggled\nand conquered not only with things without, but things within. His face\nhad all the pallor, but likewise all the peace of victory. Agatha rose\nto meet him.\n\n\"Have you been waiting for me this long while? Good child!\" And he\nsmiled, but solemnly, as with an inward sense of the Presence which\nmakes all things equal--softens all asperities and calms all passions.\n\n\"Do you know where my brother is?\" asked Nathanael.\n\n\"Down-stairs, with the rest.\"\n\n\"Will you go and fetch him?\"\n\nAgatha looked up at her husband half incredulously. \"Have you then\nsucceeded? Is all made right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, how good--how good you are!\" She grasped his hands and kissed them,\nher eyes floating in tears; then, lest he should be displeased, ran\nquickly away.\n\nMiss Valery met her at the stairhead, coming from the gallery where were\nElizabeth's rooms. They exchanged the usual question, \"How is he now?\"\nand then Agatha said:\n\n\"Be glad with me! I am sent to fetch Major Harper.\"\n\nAnne pressed her hand. \"Go and tell him. He is with Elizabeth.\"\n\nAnd there Agatha found him overcome with grief--the gay, handsome Major\nHarper! steadfast neither in good nor evil. He sat, his head bent, his\nhair falling disordered, its greyness showing, oh! so plain. Plainer\nstill were the wrinkles which a life of smiles had carved only the\ndeeper round the mouth--token of how near upon him was creeping a\ndesolate unhonoured age. By his side, talking softly, with his hand\nin hers, lay the crippled sister, perhaps the only living creature who\nreally loved him.\n\n\"Major Harper,\" Agatha spoke softly, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\nThe poor broken-down man, dropping into old age! there was no fear of\nhis thinking she was in love with him now.\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I am sent to fetch you to your father.\"\n\nHe looked incredulous;--Agatha repeated her message.\n\n\"My husband sent me. Your father wishes very much to see you. Come.\"\n\n\"Elizabeth!\" He turned to her as if she could make him understand this\nincomprehensible news.\n\nElizabeth clasped his hand and loosed it. She said nothing, but Agatha\nsaw she was weeping for joy. Her brother rose and went through the long\ngallery they passed, his sister-in-law carrying the light, and leading\nhim. He had quite forgotten his courteous manners now. Agatha thought of\nthe days in London--when he had escorted her to operas, and murmured\nover her in drawing-rooms, making her so happy and honoured in his\nnotice. Poor Major Harper! How vain were all the shows of his brilliant\nlife, the men who had courted him, the women who had flattered and\nadmired him! Agatha forgave him all his follies--ay even all the hearts\nhe had broken. There was not one of those poor hearts, not one, on which\nhe could rest his tired head now!\n\nAt the door of their father's room Nathanael met him, a new and more\nrighteous Jacob dealing with a more desolate Esau. And like Esau's was\nthe cry that broke from Frederick Harper as he went in and flung himself\non his knees by the bed.\n\n\"_Bless me--even me also--O' my father._\"\n\nThere was no answer. The words of forgiveness were denied his hearing.\nThe old Squire could but look at his son, and move his lips in an\narticulate murmur.\n\nAgatha ran to Major Harper's side. It was pitiful to see the shock he\nhad received, and the frenzied way in which he called upon his father to\nspeak--if only one word.\n\n\"He cannot speak, you know, but he does indeed forgive you. Be sure that\nhe forgives you!\"\n\nHer husband drew her away to the little curtained alcove which had\nbeen Mrs. Harper's dressing-room. There they stood, close together--for\nNathanael did not let her go, and she clung to him in tears--while the\nfather and son had their reconciliation.\n\nIt was silent throughout, for after the first burst, Major Harper was\nnot heard to speak. Now and then came a sound like the smothered sob of\na boy. No one saw the faces of father and son; they were bent together,\njust as when, years upon years ago, the proud father had sometimes\ncondescended to let his baby son, his first-born and heir, go to sleep\nupon his shoulder.\n\nThus, after many minutes, Nathanael found them lying.\n\nHe held the curtain aside to see his father's countenance; it was very\npeaceful now, though with a dimness gathering in the open eyes. Agatha\nhad never before seen that look--the unmistakable shadow of death. She\nshrank back, trembling violently. Her husband put his arm round her.\n\n\"Do not be afraid, my child,\" he whispered, using the old word and tone.\nShe rested on him, and was quieted.\n\n\"I think we had better call them all in now.\"\n\n\"Shall I fetch them?\" said his wife, and went out, flitting once more\nthrough the still, ghostly house. But she thought of her husband, of his\nlast word and look, and had no fear.\n\nThey came in, all that were now living of the old man's children--save\none--the poor Elizabeth. They stood round the bed, a full circle, his\ntwo sons, his three daughters, his son-in-law and daughter-in-law, and\nlastly Anne Valery. She was the palest and most serene of all.\n\nThus for an hour or more they waited--so slow was the last closing\nof the long-drawn-out life. There was no pain or struggle; merely the\nebbing away of breath. The palsied hands, white and beautiful to the\nlast, lay smooth on the counterpane; and when occasionally one or other\nof his daughters knelt down and kissed him, the old man feebly smiled.\nBut whenever he opened his eyes, they travelled no farther than to the\nface of his eldest son--rested there, brightened and closed.\n\nAnd thus, lying quietly in the midst of his children, at daybreak the\nold Squire died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nThe old man was gathered to his fathers.\n\nIt was the day after that on which he had been borne to the place\nappointed for all living. A new coffin rested beside that of Catherine\nHarper in the family vault; the portrait still smiled, but on an empty\nbed. There was no separation now.\n\nAt Kingcombe Holm the house had awakened from its sleep of mourning;\nthe shutters were opened, and the sunshine came in familiarly on the\nfamiliar rooms--where was missed the presence of him who had abided\nthere for threescore years and ten. But what were they? Counted only as\n\"labour and sorrow\"--they had all passed away, and he was gone.\n\nThe family met--a large table circle. They looked melancholy, all\nin their weeds, but otherwise were as usual. A certain gravity and\nunder-tone in speaking alone remained. Mary had again begun to busy\nherself over her housekeeping; and Eulalie, looking prettier than ever\nin her black dress, was listening with satisfaction to the Reverend\nMr. Thorpe, a worthy, simple young man, who had come at once to pay the\nfamily of his affianced the respect of attending the funeral, and\nto plan another ceremony, when the decent term of mourning should be\nexpired.\n\nMajor Harper, now recovering something of his old elasticity of\nmanner, took the place at the foot of the breakfast-table, whence\nMary, presiding as usual, cast over to him glances sometimes of pride,\nsometimes of doubtful curiosity, as if speculating on what sort of a\nruler the future head of the house would be.\n\nA very courteous and graceful one, most surely!--to judge by the way in\nwhich he was doing the agreeable to his sister-in-law. Quite harmlessly,\nonly it seemed as necessary for Major Harper to warm himself in the fair\nlooks of some woman or other, as for a drenched butterfly to dry its\nwings in the sunshine. He was indeed a poor helpless human butterfly,\nnot made for cloudy weather, storm, or night!\n\nBut he fluttered in vain; Agatha took no notice of him whatsoever. Her\nwhole nature had deepened down to other things--things far beneath the\nshallow ken of Major Harper.\n\nDuring this week, when the numerous duties of the brothers of the family\nleft its womenkind nearly alone, shut up in the house of mourning, with\nnothing outwardly to do or to think of beyond the fold of crape or a\ngown, or the make of a bonnet--Agatha had learnt strange secrets. They\nwere not of Death, but of Love.\n\nShe had seen very little of her husband. Either by necessity or design,\nhe had been almost constantly away; at Thornhurst, arranging business\nfor Miss Valery, who had gone home; sometimes at Kingcombe, in his\nown house--his lonely house; and for two days and nights, to the\nastonishment and slight scandal of his sisters, he had been absent in\nCornwall. But wherever he was, or whatever he had to do, he either saw\nor wrote to his wife every day; kind, grave words, or kinder letters;\nbrother-like in their wisdom and tenderness--just the sort of tenderness\nthat he seemed to believe she would wish for from him.\n\nAgatha accepted all--these brief meetings--these constant letters; saw\nthe wounding curiosity of his sisters relax, and even Harriet Dugdale\nacknowledged how mistaken had been her former notions, and on what\nexcellent terms her brother and his wife now evidently were; she really\nnever thought Nathanael would have made such an attentive, affectionate\nhusband! And Agatha smiled outwardly a proud satisfied smile; while\ninwardly---oh, what a crushed, remorseful, passionate heart was there!\n\nA heart which now began to know itself--at once its fulness and its\ncravings. A heart thirsting for that love, wanting which, marriage is\nbut a dead corrupting body without the soul--love, the true life-union,\nconsisting of oneness of spirit, sympathy, thought, and will--love which\nwould have been the same had they lived twenty thousand miles apart, ay,\nhad they never married at all, but waited until eternity united those\nwhom no earthly destinies could altogether put asunder. Now out of her\nown soul she learnt--what not one human being in a million learns,\nand yet the truth remains the same--the unity, the immortality, the\ndivineness of Love, to which the One Immortal and Divine gave His own\nname.\n\nShe sat in her usual quiet mood, she did everything in such a quiet,\nself-contained fashion now--sat, idly talked to by Major Harper, whom\nshe did not hear at all. She only heard, at the further end of the\ntable, Nathanael talking to Mary. Sometimes she stole a glance, and\nthought how cordial his manner to his sister was, and how tender his\neyes could look at times. And she sighed. At her sigh, her husband would\nturn, see her listening to Frederick with that absent downcast look--and\nbecome silent.\n\nNot an angry jealous silence now--his whole manner showed how much he\nhonoured and trusted his wife--but the hush of a deep, abiding pain, a\nsense of loss which nothing could ever reveal or remove.\n\nBut men must keep up worldly duties; it is only women, and not all of\nthese, who can afford the luxury of a broken heart. Mr. Harper rose,\nnerved for the day's task--a painful one, as all the family knew. The\nelder brother had shrunk from it, and it had been left to Nathanael, who\nin all things was now the thinker and the doer. The impression of this\nhad fixed itself outwardly, effacing the last remnant of his boyish\nlooks. As he stood leaning over Mary, Agatha thought he had already the\naspect of middle age.\n\n\"It will not take me long, Mary, since you say my father kept his papers\nin such order. Probably I shall have done by the time the Dugdales come.\nYou are quite sure there was a will?\"\n\n\"Quite sure; you will probably find it in the cabinet. I saw him looking\nthere the very afternoon of the day he died. I was calling him\nto dinner, but his back was turned, and I could not make him\nunderstand--poor father!\"\n\nMary's eyes filled, but the younger brother said a few kind words, and\nher grief ceased The rest were silent and serious, until Nathanael,\ngoing away, addressed Frederick rather formally. All speech between\nthem, though smooth, was invariably formal and rare.\n\n\"You are satisfied to leave this duty in my hands?--you do not wish to\nshare it?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" hurriedly answered the other, walking away in the sunny\nwindow-seat, and breathing its freshness eagerly, as if to drive away\nthe bare thought of death and the grave.\n\nNathanael went out--but ere he had closed the door a little hand touched\nhim.\n\n\"What do you want, Agatha?\"\n\n\"I should like to go with you, if you would allow--that is, if you would\nnot forbid me.\"\n\n\"Forbid you? Nay! But\"--\n\n\"I want--not to interrupt you, or share any family secrets--but just to\nsit near you in the room. This is such a strange, dreary house now!\" And\nshe shivered.\n\nHer husband sighed. \"Poor child--such a child to be in the midst of us\nand our trouble! Come with me if you will.\" And he took her into the\nstudy.\n\nNo one had been there since the father died; directly afterwards some\ncareful hand had locked the door, and brought the key to Nathanael;\nand it was the only room in the house whose window, undarkened, had met\nduring all that week the eye of day. It felt close with sunshine and\nwant of air. Mr. Harper opened the casement, and placed an arm-chair\nbeside it, where Agatha might look out on the chrysanthemum bed, and the\ntall evergreen, where a robin sat singing. He pointed out both to her,\nas if wishing to fortify her with a sense of life and cheerfulness, and\nthen sat down to the gloomy task of looking over his father's papers.\n\nThey were very few--at least those left open in the desk; merely\naccounts of the estate, kept with brevity and with much apparent labour;\nsixty years ago literature, nay, education, were at a low ebb among\nEnglish country gentlemen. But all the papers were so carefully\narranged, that Nathanael had nothing to do but to glance over them and\ntie them up--simple yearly records of the just life and honest dealings\nof a good man, who transferred unencumbered to his children the trust\nleft by his ancestors.\n\n\"I think,\" said Nathanael--breaking the dreary silence--\"I think there\nnever was one of the Harper line who lived a long life so stainlessly,\nso honourably, as my father.\"\n\nAnd somehow, as he tied up the packets, his finger slightly trembled.\nAgatha came and stood by him.\n\n\"Let me help you; I have ready hands.\"\n\n\"But why should I make use of them?\"\n\n\"Have you not a right?\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"Nay, I never claim as a right anything which is not freely given.\"\n\n\"But I give it. It pleases me to help you,\" said Agatha, in a low tone,\nafraid of her own voice. She took the papers from him, and tried to make\nherself busy, in her innocent way. It cheered her.\n\nNathanael watched her for a minute. \"You are very neat-handed, Agatha,\nand it is kind of you to help me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I would help any one.\" Foolish, thoughtless words! He said no more,\nbut went and looked over the cabinet.\n\nThis was a sadder duty. There were letters extending over more than a\nhalf century. The Squire received so few that he seemed never to have\nburnt one. The oldest--fifty years old--were love-letters, of the time\nwhen people wrote love-letters beginning \"Honoured Miss,\" and \"Dear\nand respected Sir,\" overlaying the plain heart-truth with no\nsentimentalisms of the pen. The signatures, \"Catherine Grey,\" and\n\"Nathanael Harper,\" in round, formal, girl and boy hand, told how young\nthey were when this correspondence began;--young still, when its sudden\nceasing showed that courtship had become marriage. From that time,\nfor nearly twenty years, there was scarcely a letter signed Catharine\nHarper.\n\n\"This looks,\" said Agatha, who unconsciously to both had come to stand\nby her husband and share in his task--\"this looks as if they were so\nrarely parted that they had no need for letter-writing.\"\n\n\"It was so: I believe my father and mother lived very happily together.\"\n\n\"I should like to read these letters all through, if I might? They are\nthe only love-letters I ever saw.\"\n\n\"Are they, indeed?\"\n\nThe sharp questioning look startled Agatha. She remembered that first\nletter of Nathanael's--perhaps he was vexed that she had apparently\nforgotten it--the letter which had been such a solemn epoch in her young\nlife. She coloured vividly and painfully.\n\n\"I mean--that is\"--\n\nHer husband looked another way. \"You shall have these letters if you so\nmuch desire it.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I would like to keep something of your mother's. And she was\nindeed so happy in her marriage?\"\n\n\"Very happy, Anne Valery says. My father's was not a perfect temper,\nbut she understood him thoroughly, and he trusted her. He had need; he\nknew--what is a rare thing in marriage now-a-days--that he had been his\nwife's first love.\"\n\nAgatha made no reply, and the conversation dropped.\n\nNext to Mrs. Harper's letters, and preserved with almost equal care, was\nanother packet. It began with a child's scrawl--double-lined, upright\nand stiff:\n\n\n\"My dear Father,\n\n\"Uncle Brian has ruled me this paper, and ruled Anne another. We are\nall very merry at Weymouth. We don't want to come home, except to\nsee\"--(here a word, apparently \"_ponies_\" had been carefully altered, by\na more delicate hand, into something like \"_Papa_\")--\"Anne's love, and\neverybody's, from your dutiful son,\n\n\"Frederick.\"\n\n\n\"'_Frederick?_'--I thought the letter was yours.\"\n\n\"No, if he had kept any it was sure to be my brothers. Frederick must\nhave them back.\"\n\n\"Let me tie them up,\" said Agatha stretching out her hand.\n\n\"No--no--are they so very precious? Why do you want to touch them?\" said\nhe, sharply, drawing them out of her reach.\n\n\"Only that I might help you.\"\n\nMr. Harper regarded her a moment, and then put back the letters into\nher lap. \"Forgive me, I did not mean to be cross with you. But this task\nconfuses me.\"\n\nHe leaned his elbow on the cabinet, covering his eyes, and stood\nthus for two or three minutes. Agatha remained silent--who could have\nintruded on the emotion of a son at such a time? None but a wife who\ncould have stolen into his heart with a closer, dearer claim, and she,\nalas! _she_ dared not. Weeks ago--when she believed herself wronged--it\nwould have been far easier. The higher he rose, the lower she sank,\nweighed down by the bitter humility that always comes with fervent love.\nShe watched him--her heart throbbing, bursting, yearning to cast itself\nat his feet--yet she dared not.\n\n\"Now let us look over some other letters. I wonder whether Mary was\nright, and it is here we shall find the will!\"\n\nHe, then, was only thinking of letters and wills! Agatha turned away,\nand went to sit by the window and watch the chrysanthemums.\n\nAt last she was attracted back by her husband's voice.\n\n\"This is the will, I see, by the endorsement. Take it, Agatha; we will\nnot touch it till the Dugdales come. And here are more letters to my\nfather. Do you think I ought to burn them or look them over first?\"\n\nThe confidential tone in which he spoke soothed Agatha. It was a sort of\ntacit acknowledgment of her wifely rights to his trust.\n\n\"I think, suppose you look them over\"--\n\n\"I cannot,\" said he, wearily. \"Will you?\" And he gave her a handful in\nher lap. Agatha felt pleased; she thanked him, and turned them over one\nby one.\n\n\"Here is a hand which looks like Miss Valery's.\"\n\n\"It is hers. Set them by.\"\n\nShe opened another, in a careless and very illegible hand, which she\ncould not recognise at all:\n\n\n\"My dear Brother,\n\n\"The approaching marriage in your family, of which you inform me,\nunfortunately cannot alter my plans. I must recover my lost fortunes\nabroad.\n\n\"Frederick told me yesterday his certainty of being accepted by Miss\nValery. He might have told me sooner, but perhaps thought me too much of\na crusty old bachelor to sympathise with his felicity. Possibly I am.\n\n\"You ask if Anne has communicated to me the coming change in her life?\nNo.\n\n\"Farewell, brother, and God bless you and yours.\n\n\"B. L. H.\"\n\n\n\"Why, this is Uncle Brian!\" cried Agatha, giving the letter to her\nhusband. He read it, laid it aside without comment, and sat thinking.\nShe did the same. Turning, their eyes met; and they understood each\nother's thoughts, but apparently neither liked to speak. At last\nNathanael said:\n\n\"It must have been so, though I never guessed it before.\"\n\n\"But I did, though she never openly told me.\"\n\n\"Well, it is a strange world!\" mused the young man. \"Poor Uncle Brian!\"\n\n\"When do you expect him home?\"\n\n\"Any day, every day. Thank God!\"\n\n\"Did you not think she seemed a little better yesterday,\" said Agatha\nhesitatingly. \"Just a very little, you know.\"\n\n\"A little better; is she ill? What, very ill?\"--Agatha's mute answer was\nenough. \"Oh, poor, poor Anne! And he is coming home!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Agatha, shocked to see her husband's emotion--\"perhaps\nif we take great care, and she is very happy,--people must live when\nthey are happy\"--\n\n\"Few would live at all then,\" was the answer, unwontedly bitter. \"Better\nnot--better not; poor Anne! It is a hard, cruel, miserable world.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that, Nathanael?\"\n\nHe started, and Agatha too, for opening the door, with a bright, clear\nlook, was she of whom they were just talking--Anne Valery.\n\n\"I knew I might come in. I heard what you were doing here,\" and a slight\nsadness crossed her face. \"Is it all done, now?\"\n\n\"Nearly,\" and Mrs. Harper hurriedly folded the letter, which lay still\non her lap. Miss Valery's eye caught the writing; Nathanael gave it to\nher.\n\nAnne read it; at first with a natural womanly feeling--nay, even\nagitation. Soon this ceased, absorbed in the infinite peace and content\nof her whole mien. \"I knew all this long ago,\" she said calmly. \"It was\na--a _mistake_ of Frederick's.\"--Then, still calmly; \"What do you think\nI have just heard from Marmaduke!--He\"--there could be but one she\nmeant--\"he has safely landed at Havre.\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian!\" the young people both cried, and then instinctively\nrepressed the joy. It seemed too sacred to be expressed in ordinary\nfashion. And passing naturally from one thought to another, Nathanael\nglanced round the room; the unused desk, the scattered papers left to be\nexamined by the unfamiliar hands of a younger generation. Had the\nabsent one come but a little sooner! \"Alas!\" he said, \"it seems as if the\nworld's universal sorrow lay in those words, '_Too late.'_\"\n\nMiss Valery sank on a chair, her temporary strength departing. Her hands\ndropped into that fold that was peculiar and habitual to them--a simple\nattitude, not unlike Chantrey's \"Resignation.\"\n\n\"You speak truly, Nathanael. But 'our times are in _His_ hand.'\"\n\nShe said no more, and shortly Mr. Harper, taking with him the sealed\npacket that was endorsed \"_My Will_\" led the way to where the family\nwere assembled. In doing so there grew over him the hard silence always\nvisible when he was much affected. But Agatha was not surprised or hurt:\nshe began to understand him better now.\n\nIn the dining-room were only the immediate family. Every one knew the\nprobable purport of the will, and how simple a document it was likely to\nbe; for the patriarchal old Squire hated the very mention of law, and\nit had been his pride that, though not entailed, the inheritance of\nKingcombe Holm had descended for centuries unbroken by a single legal\nsquabble. Therefore they all waited indifferently, merely to go through\na necessary form; Harriet Dugdale and her husband, Eulalie and her\n_fianc\u00c3\u00a9_, and the solitary Mary. Major Harper alone was rather restless,\nespecially when the three others came in from the study. It was\nnoticeable that, with all his smooth manner, Frederick never seemed\nquite at ease in the presence of Miss Valery. Nevertheless he tried, and\nsuccessfully, to assume his position as elder brother and present head\nof the family. He gave Anne a gracious welcome.\n\n\"I scarcely expected you would have honoured us so far. This is entirely\na family meeting.\"\n\n\"Shall I leave?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" cried everybody at once, \"Anne is so thoroughly one of the\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" responded Major Harper, bowing though his brows were knit.\nHe waited till Anne took her seat, and then sat down, silent. Many\nchanges, vivid, and various, passed over his flexible mouth. At last,\nleaning forward, he hid it with his hand. There was a brief hush in\nthe men, of solemnity--in the women, of mourning. More than one tear\nsplashed on the black dress of the tender-hearted Mary.\n\nNathanael stood--the will in his hand--hesitating.\n\n\"It seems to me, that as this is a family meeting, we might--not\nnecessarily, but still out of kindness and respect--postpone it for a\nfew days, that the only remaining member of the family may be present.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" said the elder brother.\n\n\"Uncle Brian.\"\n\nOne or two voices, especially the Dugdales, seconded this, and eagerly\nproposed to wait for Uncle Brian.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Major Harper said, hastily. \"I have engagements. I cannot\nwait for any one.\"\n\n\"But\"--\n\n\"Nathanael--don't argue. Remember, I am the elder brother. Give me my\nfather's will.\" Nathanael paused a moment, and gave it. \"The seal has\nbeen broken and re-fastened,\" Frederick added, breaking it with rather\nnervous hands. He tried to glance over it, but his eyes wandered\nunsteadily. \"There, take it and read. I hate business.\"\n\nAnd he threw himself back in his seat, which happened to be the old\nSquire's especial chair. Agatha thought it was thoughtless of him to use\nit.\n\nNathanael read the will aloud. It was dated ten years back, and was in\nthe Squire's own hand, drawn up simply, but with perfect clearness. The\ndivision of fortune was as they all expected: a moderate funded sum to\neach of the daughters and to Nathanael; the estate, with all real and\npersonal property, to go to the eldest son. There were a few small\nbequests to servants, and one gift of the late Mrs. Harper's jewels.\n\n\"I meant them,\" the old man wrote, \"for my eldest son's wife.\nDisappointed in this, I leave them to Anne Valery.\"\n\nMajor Harper moved restlessly in his chair. Anne sat quiet. The young\nAgatha looked at them, and wondered if people grew callous as they grew\nold.\n\n\"Is it all read?\" said Frederick.\n\n\"Yes. Stay, here are a few lines; a codicil, I fancy, affixed with seals\nto the body of the will I can hardly make it out.\"\n\nAnd as Mr. Harper perused it, his wife observed his countenance change.\nHe let the paper drop, and sat silent.\n\n\"What is it? Read,\", cried Harrie Dugdale.\n\n\"I cannot--Anne, will you? God knows, brothers and sisters\"--and he\nlooked all round the circle with an eagerly appealing gaze--\"God knows\nI never knew or dreamed of this. Anne, read.\"\n\n\"Shall I read, Major Harper?\"\n\nHe was gazing out of the window with an absent air. At the sound of her\nvoice he started, and gave some mechanical assent.\n\nAnne read the date--of only twelve days back.\n\n\"That was the very day that he was taken ill, you know,\" whispered Mary.\n\nThe codicil began:\n\n\"I, Nathanael Harper, being in sound mind and body, do hereby make\nmy last will and testament, utterly revoking all others, in so far\nas relates to my two sons. I leave to my younger son, Nathanael Locke\nHarper, all my landed, real, and personal estate, praying that he may\nlong live and maintain our name in honour at Kingcombe Holm. To my\neldest son--having no desire to expose to ruin the family estate, or\nlink the family name with more dishonour than it already bears--to my\neldest son, Frederick Harper, I leave the sum of One Shilling.\"\n\nAnne's reading ceased. Dead silence, utter, frightened silence,\nfollowed. Then arose a chorus of women's voices--\"Oh, Frederick!--oh,\nFrederick!\"\n\nFrederick rose, feebly smiling. \"It is a mistake--all a mistake. My\nfather was not in his right mind.\"\n\nThe sisterly tide turned. \"Oh, hush, Frederick! How wicked of you to say\nso!\"\n\n\"Well read it over again,\" said Marmaduke Dugdale, waking up into the\ninterests of the world around him. Anne gave him the paper, and he read\nit with his ponderous, manly voice, rounding out every bitter word which\nAnne had softened down. All was undoubtedly legal, signed in his own\nhand, and witnessed by two of his servants. There could be no doubt it\nwas done immediately before the paralytic attack, when he was perfectly\nin his senses; indeed, he could not be said ever to have lost them.\n\nThe family sat, awed by their father's deed; to question which never\nstruck them for a moment--legal chicanery was not rife at Kingcombe\nHolm. They looked at the disinherited brother with a sort of shrinking\nwonder, as if he had done some great unknown wickedness. He might have\nsat there ever so long, conscience-stricken and stupified, but this\nfamily gaze stung him into violence.\n\n\"I say it is a cheat--how or by whom contrived I know not--but it is a\ncheat. My father loved me--the only one of you who ever did. If there\nwas a coolness between us, he forgave me when he died. You all saw\nthat.\"\n\nThere was no denying it. Every one remembered how the father's last\ndying look of love had been on his eldest son. Again the tide of family\nfeeling changed. They threw doubtful glances towards Nathanael, except\nhis wife. But she drew closer to him, and trembled and doubted no more.\n\nHe stood, meeting the eyes of all his family. In his aspect was great\ndistress, but entire composure--not a shadow of hesitation or confusion.\nNor, on the other hand, was there any triumph. When he spoke--they\nseemed expecting him to speak--his voice was low and steady:\n\n\"You know, brother, and all the rest of you know, that I have had no\nhand in this matter.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of the sort,\" cried Frederick. \"I only know that I have\nbeen defrauded--disgraced.--Not by any act of my father's, or he would\nnot lie quiet in his grave. My father always loved me.\" And the quick\nfeeling natural to Major Harper made him hesitate--unable to proceed.\nBut soon he continued, vehemently:\n\n\"I will find out this. Evil speakers, malicious, underhand hypocrites,\nhave turned my father against me. I declare to Heaven that I never\nwronged any\"--\n\nFrederick stopped--interrupted not by words, for there was perfect\nsilence--but by a certain quiet look of Anne Valery's, which fastened on\nhis face. He turned crimson--he had so much of the woman in him, though\nof womanhood in its weakest form. He glanced from Miss Valery to Agatha,\nand then back again.\n\n\"Anne--Anne Valery, tell me do you know anything?\"\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"You--even you!\" For the moment, he cowered in such emotion as was\npitiful to see; but it passed and he grew desperate.\n\n\"I say, I will contest this will. It shall be proved invalid. My lawyer\nGrimes\"--\n\n\"Mr. Grimes has been here, and is now gone to America,\" Anne whispered.\n\"I urged and assisted him to go, that he should not throw disgrace on\nthe family.\"\n\nAgain Frederick cowered down, then rose, goaded to the last degree.\n\"Nevertheless, this will shall not stand. I will throw it into Chancery.\nI will leave for London this very day.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Nathanael, starting from deep thought, and intercepting him\nas he was quitting the room. \"One word, Frederick.\"\n\n\"Not one! You are all against me, but I will brave you all. I will have\nmy rights--ay, even if I plead my father's insanity.\"\n\n\"Oh, horrible!\" cried his sisters.\n\n\"Frederick, you know that to be impossible,\" said Nathanael, sternly.\n\n\"Then I will plead what may prove a deeper disgrace to the family\nthan madness, or even--what I am supposed to have done,\" catching his\nbrother's arm, and hissing out the words in his face--\"I will plead\nthat the will is _a forgery_.\"\n\nNathanael wrenched away his hold, thereby throwing Frederick back almost\nto the floor. The two stood for a moment glaring at one another, in that\ndeadly animosity, most deadly when it arises between brothers,--and then\nthe younger recovered himself. It might be because, instantaneously as\nthe struggle had begun and ended, he had heard a woman's cry of terror,\nand the name uttered was not \"Frederick,\" but \"Nathanael.\" Also, as he\nstood, he felt two little hands steal from behind and tighten over his\nown. He grew very calm then.\n\n\"Frederick, you must unsay that word. There are some things which a man\ncannot bear even from his brother. No doubt can exist that this is my\nfather's own writing, and no forgery. You know that as well as I do.\"\n\n\"As well as you do! Exactly what I meant to observe,\" said Major Harper,\nwith his keenest and politest sneer.\n\nNathanael moved back. A man's roused passions are always terrible;\nbut there is something ten times more awful in fury that is altogether\ncalm--molten down as it were to a white heat. Never but once--that\nuneffaceable _once_--had Agatha seen her husband look as he looked now.\n\n\"Pause one minute, Frederick. If you had waited and heard me speak\"----\n\n\"I dare you to speak!\"\n\n\"It would be better not to dare me. I am at my last ebb of patience.\nI have kept faithfully my promise to you. None of our family know--not\neven my own wife--all that is known by you and me, and our father whom\nwe buried yesterday. I would have saved him from the knowledge if I\ncould, but it was not to be. Now, take care. If you drive me to it\"--\n\nHe hesitated. Agatha felt his hand--the thin boyish hand--grow cold as\nice and rigid as iron. She uttered a faint cry.\n\n\"Agatha, my wife,\" with the old sweetness in the whisper, \"go and sit\ndown. Leave me to reason with my brother.\"\n\n\"No, let _me_ do that,\" said one coming between. It was Anne Valery.\n\nShe had risen from the chair where, during almost all this time, she\nhad sat like a statue, only none watched her, not even Agatha. When she\nrose, it was with a motion so slow and gliding, her soft black dress\nscarcely rustling as she moved, that Frederick Harper might well start,\nthinking a supernatural touch was on his arm.\n\n\"Anne, is it you? I had forgotten you. No\"--he muttered, half to\nhimself, turning from the contest with his brother to gaze on her--\"no,\nI never did--never do forget you.\"\n\n\"I believe that. Come and speak to me here.\"\n\nUnresisted, she put her arm in his, and led him away to the deep\nbay-window, circled with a low-cushioned sill, such as delights\nchildren. Anne sat down.\n\n\"Are you determined on this cruel course?\"\n\n\"I must recover my rights,\" was the sullen answer. \"Any man would.\"\n\n\"And when you have done this--supposing it practicable--what further do\nyou purpose?\"\n\n\"What further?\" He looked puzzled, but at last perceived her meaning.\nWith an impulse eagerly caught, as Major Harper caught all impulses,\ngood and ill, he cried--\"Yes, I understand you. My first act, on coming\nto my property shall be to right poor Agatha.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Anne, kindly. \"But you will not be able. There\nare others whose claims will be upon you the instant you have money\nto satisfy them--the shareholders. They know nothing of Agatha Bowen.\nRemember you expended her fortune as you worked the mine--_in your own\nname._\"\n\nMajor Harper looked confounded with shame. \"And you knew all this,\nAnne--you! For how long?\"\n\n\"For some months--ever since I bought Wheal Caroline.\"\n\n\"And you never betrayed me!\"\n\n\"We were playfellows, Frederick.\" She spoke softly, and turned her face\nto the other side of the bay-window.\n\nHe forgot she was old now--he remembered only the familiar voice and\nattitude, the same as when in her girlish days she used to sit on the\ncushioned window-sill and talk with him for hours.\n\n\"Playfellows! Was that all, Anne? Only playfellows?\"\n\n\"Only playfellows,\" she repeated firmly. \"Never anything more. You\nknew that always.\" And, perhaps unconsciously, Anne looked down on a\nring--plain, not unlike a childish keepsake--which she always wore on\nthe wedding-finger of her left hand.\n\nMajor Harper sighed, not one of his sentimental sighs, but one from the\ndeeps of his heart. A smile, hollow and sad, followed it. \"I suppose it\nis idle talking now, but--but--you were my first-love, Anne! If things\nhad gone differently, I might have been a different man.\"\n\n\"Not so. God ordained your fate, not I. No man need be ruined for life\nbecause a woman cannot love him. Human beings hang not on one another\nin that blind way. We have each an individual soul; on another soul\nmay rest all its hopes and joys, but on God only rests its worth,\nits duties, and its nobility. We may live to do His work, and rejoice\ntherein, long after we have forgotten the very sound of that idle\nword--happiness.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Go on; you talk as you always used to do.\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Anne, with a faint smile; \"I am hardly strong enough.\nFrederick,\" and her eyes had their former lovely, earnest look--earnest\nalmost to tears, save that girl-tears had from them long been\ndried,--\"Frederick, for the sake of our olden days--of your mother whom\nwe both loved--of your father who has gone to her--listen to me for a\nlittle. Trust to your brother--he will not act unjustly. Do not create\ndissensions in your family; do not let people say that the moment Mr.\nHarper's head was laid in the grave his children quarrelled over his\nproperty.\"\n\n\"I do not quarrel--I but take my right,\" cried Major Harper, becoming\nagain the \"man of the world,\" as he saw, the curious glances that from\ntime to time reached the bay-window. \"Thank you for this good advice;\nfor which my brother owes you even more than I. But I am not a child\nnow, nor a boy in love, to be talked over by a woman.\"\n\nMiss Valery rose, rather proudly. \"Nor am I that woman, Major Harper.\nBut I have been so long united in affection with your family; I could\nnot bear to think it would be brought to dishonour. Surely--surely _you_\nwill not be the one to do it.\"\n\nAgain as he turned to go, she drew him back by those earnest eyes.\n\n\"Frederick, it would grieve me so, ay, break my heart, to see them\nbrought into open shame, the old familiar home, and the name--the dear,\ndear name.\"\n\nMajor Harper's bitter tongue burst its control and stung. \"I now see\nyour motive. Everybody knows how very dearly Anne Valery has all her\nlife loved the Harper name.\"\n\nAnne rose to her full height, and a blush, vivid as a girl's, dyed her\ncheek. \"I have,\" she said--\"I have loved it, and I am not ashamed.\"\n\nThe blush paled--she sank back on the window-sill. Major Harper was\nalarmed.\n\n\"Anne--how ill you look! What have I done to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered; and, catching his arm, drew herself upright\nonce more.\n\n\"Frederick, we were children together, and you loved me; some day you\nwill remember that. Afterwards we grew up young people, and, still\nthinking you loved me--but it was only vanity then--you did me a great\nwrong; I will not say how, or when, or why, and no one knows the fact\nsave me--but you did it. You did the same wrong to another lately.\"\n\n\"How--how?\"\n\n\"You said to Mrs. Thornycroft--you see I have learnt all, for I wrote\nand asked her--you said that you 'feared' poor little Agatha loved you,\nand\"--\n\n\"I know--I know.\"\n\n\"You know, too, that vanity misled you; that it was not true. But it was\na wicked thing to say; trifling with a woman's honour--torturing those\nwho loved her--bringing on her worlds of suffering. Still, she is young,\nand her suffering may end in joy;--mine\"--\n\nAnne paused; the human nature struggled hard within her breast--she was\nnot quite old yet. At length it calmed down--that last anguished cry of\nthe soul against its appointed destiny.\n\nShe took her old playmate by the hand, saying gently,\n\n\"I am going away soon--going _home_. Before I go, I would like to say,\nas I used to do when you were unkind to me as a child, 'Good-night, and\nI forgive Fred everything.'\"\n\n\"Oh, Anne--Anne.\" He kissed her hand in strong emotion.\n\n\"Hush! I cannot talk more,\" she went on quickly. \"You will do as I ask?\nYou will wait until--until\"--\n\nShe stopped speaking, and put her handkerchief to her lips. Slowly,\nslowly, red drops shone through its folds. Major Harper called wildly\nfor his sisters.\n\n\"I knew how it would be,\" cried Mary Harper. \"It has happened twice\nbefore, and Doctor Mason said if it happened again\"--\n\n\"Oh, God forgive me!\" groaned Frederick, as his brother carried Anne\nValery away. \"She will die--and I shall have killed her!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nAnne Valery did not die. Agatha had said she would not; and the young\nheart's creed was true. It had its foundation in a higher law than that\nof physical suffering.\n\nAfter a few days she was able to be moved to her own house, according to\nher earnest desire; after a few more, the energy of her mind seemed to\nput miraculous strength into her feeble body.\n\n\"I knew you would get well,\" said Agatha joyfully, as she watched her\npatient returning to ordinary household ways; only lying down a little\nmore than Anne was used to do, and speaking seldom and low always, for\nfear of the bleeding at the lungs. \"I knew you must get well, but I\nnever saw anybody get well so fast as you.\"\n\n\"I had need,\" Anne answered. \"I have so much to do.\"\n\n\"That you always have. What a busy rich life--rich in the best\nsense--yours has been! How unlike mine!\"\n\n\"I hope so--in many things,\" said Anne, to herself. \"But I must not\nspeak much. I talked my last talk with poor Frederick in the bay-window.\nWhere is Frederick?\"\n\n\"He has been riding up and down the country day after day--he seems to\nfind no rest.\"\n\nAnne looked sorry. \"And we are so quiet here!\"\n\nIt was indeed very quiet, that sombre house at Thorn-hurst, through\nwhose wintry rooms no one wandered but Agatha, excepting the old,\nattached servants. Yet this was of her own will. She had been jealous\nthat any one should attempt to nurse Anne but herself. She left even her\nown home to do it. Yet--the bitter thought followed her ever--this last\nwas small renunciation. No one would miss her there!\n\nDuring the days when Miss Valery lay ill, the world without had been\nshut from Agatha's view. Woman-like, she lived within the four walls and\nbeside the sick couch, and had only seen her husband for a few minutes\neach day, when, though he talked to her only of Anne, his manner had a\nsoft, reverent tenderness, and a troubled humility, as if he began to\nsee a different image in his young wife. She was different, and he too.\nNeither knew how or when the change came--but it was there.\n\nShe did so miss him, when, having taken them safe to Thornhurst, and\ntold her \"that she might stay there as long as Anne needed her, but no\nlonger\"--ah, that happy \"but!\"--he went away to his own little house at\nKingcombe, and busied himself there for three days.\n\n\"Do you think Nathanael will come and see us this morning?\" said Anne,\nlooking up from the papers with which she was occupied, towards Agatha,\nwho stood at the window watching down the road.\n\n\"Did you want my husband!\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I can do my business myself now. But I think he will come.\"\n\n\"Why do you think so?\"\n\n\"Why?--Child, come here.\" And as Agatha knelt by the sofa, Miss Valery\nleaned over her, twisting her curls and stroking down the lids over\nher brown eyes in the babyish, fondling ways which all good people can\ncondescend to at times, especially when recovering from sickness.\n\n\"She is a foolish child! Did she fancy nobody loved her? Did she think\neverybody believed she was wicked (and so she was, now and then, very\nwicked). Does she suppose nobody sees her poor little goodnesses? Oh,\nbut they do! They will find all out without my telling. It is best to\nleave things alone.\"\n\n\"You must not speak; it will do you harm.\"\n\n\"Not thus whispering. Nay, lay the head down again. Imagine it only a\nlittle bird in the air talking to my child. Some kind of characters--I\nonce knew the like well!\"--and Anne's whisper came through a half\nsigh--\"are very proud and jealous over the thing they love. They\ncannot bear a breath to rest on it, or to go from it to any other than\nthemselves. They are very silent, too; would die rather than complain.\nThey are strong-willed and secret--and as for persuading them to\nanything against their will, you might as well attempt to cleave with\nyour little hand to the heart of a great oak. You must shine over it,\nand rain softly on it, and cling close round it, and it will take\nyou into its arms, and support you safe, and hang you all round with\nbeautiful leaves. But you must always remember that it is a noble\nforest-oak, and that you are only its dews, or its sunshine, or its ivy\ngarland. You must never attempt to come between it and the skies.\"\n\nAnne ceased. Agatha looked up with moistened eyelids.\n\n\"I understand; I will try--if you will stay with me. I cannot do\nanything right without you.\"\n\nAnne smiled. \"Poor little Agatha! Not even with the help of her\nhusband?\"\n\n\"My husband! Oh, teach me to be a good wife, such a wife as you would\nhave been--as you may be\"--\n\nAgatha felt a soft finger closing her lips, and knew that on _that_\nsubject there must still be, as ever, total silence. She hid her face,\nand obeyed.\n\nAt length Miss Valery started. \"There is a horse coming down the road, I\nthink. Go, look. It may be your husband.\"\n\nAgatha rose, and ran to the window.\n\nAnne half rose too. \"I fancy I hear two horses. Is anybody with\nNathanael?\"\n\n\"Only Mr. Dugdale.\"\n\n\"Ah! well!\" There was the slightest possible compression of eyelids and\nmouth, and Anne resumed her place again. \"It is very kind of Marmaduke.\"\n\nThe visitors came in softly. Duke Dugdale was the kindest, gentlest\nsoul to any one that was ill--wise as a doctor, merry as a child. But\nnow--though he strove to hide it--his countenance was overcast.\n\n\"It's no use, Anne,\" he said, after a brief greeting, during which\nhe felt her pulse in quite a professional way, and pronounced it\n\"stronger--much stronger--and too quick almost.\"\n\n\"What is of no use?\"\n\n\"Brian Harper won't come home! All his abominable, con--yes, I'll out\nwith it--his confounded pride.\" And Duke tried to look very savage, but\ncouldn't manage it.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Somewhere near Havre; we can't make out where. He will not write. Ask\nNathanael.\"\n\n\"I am afraid it is too true,\" said Nathanael, leaving his wife, to whom\nhe had been talking by the window. \"I shall have to hunt him out, and\nuse all my persuasions before he will come home; because he is too proud\nto return poor as he went out. What shall I say to him, Anne? I shall\nstart to-morrow.\"\n\nAgatha turned quickly round. Her husband did not see her anxious\nlook--he was watching Miss Valery.\n\n\"Tell him, Nathanael, that his brother is dead, and his presence needed\nin the family. Once make him understand that it is right to come, and he\nwill come. No one was ever more able to do or to suffer _for the right_,\nthan Brian Harper.\"\n\nMarmaduke shook her hand heartily. \"Anne, you are as wise as a man,\nand as faithful as a woman. If poor Brian were going to be hanged for\nmurder, I do believe-his old friend would find a good word to say for\nhim!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Nathanael, after a silence, \"I shall go to Havre to-morrow.\nYou can spare me, Anne? And for my wife\"--\n\nAgatha hung her head. A vague dread smote her. She would have given\nworlds to have courage enough to beg him not to go.\n\n\"Havre is across the sea,\" she murmured. \"Surely Uncle Brian would come\nhome in time, if you waited.\"\n\nWaited! she caught a sight of Anne's bent profile, marble-like, with the\nshut eyes. Waited!\n\nAgatha crept to her husband's side. \"No--no waiting,\" she whispered.\n\"Go. I would not keep you back an hour. Bring him. Quick--quick.\"\n\nCould Anne have heard, that she wakened up into such a life-like smile?\n\"No, dear, you must not send your husband away so hastily. Let him\nsail from Southampton to-morrow; that will do. He wants to talk to you\nto-day.\"\n\nNathanael looked surprised. \"It is true, I did; and I told my brother to\nmeet me here this afternoon. Did you know that too?\"\n\n\"I guessed it. You are doing right, quite right. I knew you would. I\nknew _you_, Nathanael.\"\n\nShe held out her hand to him, warmly.\n\n\"Dear Anne! But you forget--it is not I only who have to do it.\"\n\n\"Not a word! Go and tell her all. Let her be the first to hear it. Away\nwith you! the sun is coming out. Run and talk in the garden-alleys,\nchildren!\"\n\nHer manner, so playful, yet full of keen penetration, drove them away\nlike a battery of sunbeams.\n\n\"What does she mean?\" said Agatha, looking up puzzled, as they stood in\nthe hall.\n\n\"She reads people's minds wonderfully clear; she always did, but clearer\nthan ever now. It is strange. Agatha, do you think\"--\n\n\"I think all sorts of things about her--different and contrary every\nhour. But the chief thought of all is, that you must go to Havre at\nonce. I long for Uncle Brian's coming. How soon can you return?\"\n\n\"As soon as practicable, you may be sure of that. But you must relax\nyour interest even in Uncle Brian just now; I want to talk to you. Shall\nwe go, as Anne said, into the garden-alleys?\"\n\n\"Anywhere that is sunny and warm,\" said Agatha, with a light shiver. Her\nhusband regarded her with that serious pathetic smile which was one of\nhis frequent moods.\n\n\"Must you always have sunshine, Agatha? Could you not walk a little\nwhile in the shade? Not if I were with you?\"\n\nShe cast her eyes down, trembling with a vague apprehension of ill; then\ngazed in the kind face that grew kinder and dearer every day. She put\nher hand in her husband's without speaking a word. He folded it up\nclose, the soft little hand, and looked pleased.\n\n\"Come now, let us go into the garden.\"\n\nAgatha wrapped a shawl about her, gipsy-fashion, and met him there. It\nwas one of those mild days that sometimes come near upon Christmas, as\nif the year had repented itself, and just before dying, was dreaming of\nits lost springtide. The arbutus-trees were glistening with sunshine,\nand under the high wall a row of camellias, grown in great bushes in\nthe open air, the pride of Anne's gardener and of the whole county of\nDorset, were beginning to show buds, red, white, and variegated, as\nbeautiful as summer roses.\n\n\"I used to be so fond of this walk when I was a little lad,\" said\nNathanael, \"I remember, after I had the scarlet-fever, being nursed well\nhere; and how every day when my brother came, he used to carry me up and\ndown this sunny walk on his back. Poor Fred! he was the kindest fellow\nto children.\"\n\n\"Kindness seems his nature. I think that if your brother did any harm\nit would never be through malice or intention, but only weakness of\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"I perceive,\" Mr. Harper said, abruptly--\"you have no bitter feeling\nagainst my brother Frederick.\"\n\n\"How could I? He never did me wrong. Except, perhaps, it was his\ncarelessness that made me poor.\" Here Agatha hesitated, for she was\ntouching upon a dangerous subject--one so fraught with present emotion\nand with references to past suffering, that hitherto both husband\nand wife had by tacit consent abstained from it. There had been no\nconfidential talk of any kind between them.\n\n\"Go on,\" her husband said; \"we must speak of these things some time; why\nnot now?\"\n\n\"Though he made me poor,\" she continued, \"it was probably through\naccident. And I have no fear of poverty\"--how simply and ignorantly she\npronounced that terrible word!--\"I do not mind it in the least, if you\ndo not.\"\n\n\"Was there any need for that _if_, Agatha?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, and was silent. Shame and remorse gathered over her\nlike a cloud. She thought of those wicked words she had spoken--words\nwhich to this day he had neither answered nor revenged. He had even\nsuffered the smooth surface of daily kindnesses to grow over that gaping\nwound of division. Was it there still? Did he remember it? Could she\ndare to allude to it, if only to implore him to forgive her? She would\nin a little time--perhaps when they were by themselves in their\nown house, when she would throw herself at his knees and weep out a\nconfession that was beyond all words--words could but insult him the\nmore. There are some wounds that can only be healed by love and silence.\n\n\"I think it is time,\" said the husband--\"full time that you heard all,\nor nearly all, connected with this painful matter. It is mere business,\nwhich I will try to make intelligible if possible. You ought not to\nbe quite so ignorant of worldly matters as you are, since, if anything\nhappened to me--But I have provided against almost everything.\"\n\n\"What are you talking of?\" said Agatha, holding him tight, with a faint\nintuition of his meaning.\n\n\"Of nothing painful. Do not be afraid. Only that I think it right to\nexplain to you what has occurred to us since our marriage--in worldly\nthings I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes. I am listening.\"\n\n\"Before we married,\" he continued, distinctly, and rather proudly, \"I\nknew nothing whatever of your fortune--not even its amount. I made no\ninquiries, interfered in no way, except reading the settlement I signed.\nThe settlement stated that your property was safe in the Funds. This\nwas a\"--his brow darkened--\"it was--_not true_. The whole had been taken\nout, contrary to your father's expressed will, and embarked in a mining\nspeculation in Cornwall.\"\n\n\"Those miners whom Miss Valery aided? Was it my money that was wasted\nat Wheal Caroline? Was it me from whom the poor miner came to seek\nredress?\"\n\n\"No; the transaction was more blameable even than that. It was all\ncarried on in my brother's name. He was made what they call 'managing\ndirector' of the company: Grimes being solicitor. There were a few\nshareholders--his clients--widows and unmarried women who had put by\ntheir savings, and such like poor people who wanted large interest,\nand some richer ones, important enough to make public their ruin--for\neverybody lost all.\"\n\n\"But the poorer shareholders--the widows--the old maids?\"\n\n\"Ay, there's the pity--there's the wickedness,\" said Nathanael, beneath\nhis breath. \"People tell me such things are common in England, but I\nwould have starved rather than have been mixed up in such a transaction,\neven in the smallest way, and with property that was bona fide my own.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Agatha, slowly understanding, \"this property was not Major\nHarper's own. Also, his doing the thing secretly afterwards, and leading\nyou to believe what was--not quite true. I must say it, I think it was\nvery wrong of your brother.\"\n\n\"Don't let us talk of him more than we can help. Remember--a brother,\nAgatha!\"\n\nMore light dawning on his strange conduct, his self-command, his secrecy\neven with her. His wife clung to his arm, her heart brimming with\nemotion that she dared not pour out. For he seemed inclined to be\nreserved even now.\n\n\"You see,\" he added, as they walked along, \"I have had some few things\nto try me.\"\n\nAgatha pressed his arm. Oh that she could break through that awe of him\nand his goodness, that shame of her own foolish erring self!\n\n\"Agatha,\" he said, stopping suddenly, \"the thing that hurt me was my\nfather. If only he had died a month ago, and never heard of this!\"\n\nIf only now Agatha could speak! But she felt choking. They walked past\nthe windows and looked in. \"There is Anne sitting by herself as she used\nto sit, watching Fred and me in the garden. He was such a handsome,\ngay young man. I felt so proud of being his little brother. And my poor\nfather--he had not a hope in the world that did not rest on Frederick.\"\n\nHe walked on rapidly back into the shadiest and darkest walk. There\nhe stopped. \"Agatha,\" taking both her hands, and reading her features\nclosely--\"Agatha, would you be very unhappy if we went back and lived,\npoor, in the little cottage?\"\n\n\"Unhappy? I?\"\n\n\"I would try that you should not be. I can earn quite enough to give\nyou many comforts. We should not be any more content if we claimed our\nrights and lived in prosperity at Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Besides, I am not sure that these are our rights, morally speaking. I\nthink, if my father had lived long enough, he would have undone what he\ndid in a moment of passion, and let the first will stand. This is what I\nhave said to myself, when considering that I have duties towards my wife\nas well as towards others, and that this would restore what was taken\nfrom her. 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' But, Agatha, we\nwould not urge that law?\"\n\n\"Never! God forbid! And Major Harper was so kind to me when I was an\norphan.\"\n\n\"_Only_ kind? Did he never--No, I am getting foolish. Say on, Agatha.\nCome, sit here; we can talk, and nobody can see or hear us.\" And he led\nhis wife to a sheltered arbutus-bower. \"Well, was my brother so kind to\nyou?\"\n\n\"He was, indeed. For the sake of that time I would forgive him anything;\nI have already forgiven him a good deal.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Tell me or not, as you choose; I urge no right to pry into your\nsecrets.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't look, don't speak in that way! Why should I not tell you?\nI would have told you before, had you asked. It was nothing--indeed\nnothing. But I was a proud girl, and he made me angry with him.\"\n\n\"For what cause?\"\n\nShe grew confused--hesitated; the shamefacedness of girlhood came over\nher. \"I will tell you,\" she said at last boldly. \"It is surely no\nharm to tell anything to my husband:--Major Harper once said to Emma\nThornycroft, that he thought I was 'in love' with him.\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"It was cruel, it was wicked, it insulted my pride. And more than\nthat--it wounded me to the heart that _he_ should say so.\"\n\n\"Was it--don't speak if you don't like--was it _true_?\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Agatha, the blood rushing in a torrent over her face. \"No,\nit was not true. I liked, I admired him, in a free girlish way; but I\nnever, never loved him.\"\n\nThere was a minute's hush in the arbutus-bower, and then Nathanael sank\ndown to his wife's side--down, lower yet, to her very feet. He wrapped\nhis arms round her waist, laying his head in her lap. His whole frame\nshook convulsively.\n\n\"Oh Heaven! You surely did not think _that?_\" cried Agatha, appalled.\n\n\"I did, ever since the day we were married. I heard him say so in the\nchurch.--He repeated it to me afterwards.--And it was a lie! Curse\"--\n\n\"No, no, forgive him!\" And Agatha sobbed on her husband's neck, clasped\nby him as she never thought he would clasp her in this world.\n\nAt last he rose, pale and sad. \"There is other forgiveness needed. I\nhave been very cruel to you, Agatha. I had made him a promise, and to it\nI sacrificed myself and you too, without remorse. But now you see how it\nwas. I could have judged my brother that I loved; I dared not _slay my\nenemy._\"\n\nThe only answer was a soft hand-pressure.\n\n\"I hardly know what I am about, Agatha,--not even whether or no my wife\nloves me; she did not when we were first married, I fear?\"\n\nAgatha drooped her head.\n\n\"Never mind, she shall love me yet; I am quite fearless now.\" He stood\nup, holding her tight in his arms, as if daring the whole world to wrest\nher from him. His whole aspect was changed. It was like the breaking up\nof an Arctic winter, when the trees bud, and the rivers pour sounding\ndown, and the sun bursts out, reigning gloriously. For a long time they\nremained thus, clasped together, so motionless that the little robin of\nthe arbutus-trees hopped on to a bough near them and began a song.\n\n\"We must go in now,\" said Agatha.\n\n\"Ay; we must not forget Anne, or anybody. One can do so much good when\none is happy!\"\n\n\"I feel so.\" She rose, hanging on his arm, but trembling still, almost\nfrightened by the insanity of his joy, whirled dizzily in the torrent of\nhis overwhelming love.\n\n\"You understand now what I had to say to you! You can guess how I mean\nto act as regards my brother?\"\n\n\"I think I can.\"\n\n\"And you will give your consent? Without it I would have done nothing. I\nwould not have taken from my wife these worldly goods, and left her only\nme and my love, unless she willed it so.\"\n\n\"I do will it.\"\n\n\"God bless her.\" He lifted Agatha from her feet, rocking her in his\narms like a baby. \"I always said God bless her! even when I was most\nwretched--most mad. I knew she was one of His angels--a woman worthy of\nall love, though she had none for me. I was not very cruel to her, was\nI?\"\n\n\"No--no.\"\n\n\"I will never be cruel to her any more. I will smother down all my\npride, my reserve, the horrible suspiciousness which is rooted in my\nnature. I will never doubt or wound her--only love her--only love her.\"\n\nBreathless, Agatha trembled to her feet again. Her husband stood by her\nside--calmer now, and radiant in the beauty of his youth. Manly as he\nwas, there was something about him which could only be expressed by the\nword \"beautiful\"--a something that, be he ever so old, would keep up his\nboyish likeness--his look of \"the angel Gabriel.\"\n\n\"Let us go into the house now.\"\n\nThey went--those two young hearts thrilling and bounding with life and\njoy--into the darkening house, the hushed presence of Anne Valery.\n\nShe was lying on her sofa, very still and death-like. The white cap tied\nunder her chin, the hands folded--the perfect silence in and about the\nroom--it was like as if she had lain down to rest, calmly and alone, in\nher solitary house, and in her sleep the spirit had flown away;--away\ninto the glorious company of angels and archangels, never to be alone\nany more.\n\nBut it was not so. Hearing footsteps, Anne opened her eyes, and\nroused herself quickly. She looked from one to the other of the young\npeople--at the first glance she seemed to understand all A great joy\nflashed across her; but she said nothing. She as well as they were long\nused to that peculiarity of nature--which especially belonged to\nthe Harper family--a conviction of the uselessness of talk and the\nsacredness of silence.\n\n\"Has my brother arrived?\" said Nathanael.\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Marmaduke is gone?\"\n\n\"Yes; he wanted to get up a Free-trade dinner for the welcoming\"--here\nshe smiled--\"of one whom he says all Dorset will be delighted to\nwelcome--your Uncle Brian. Worthy Duke! It is his hobby, and one likes\nto indulge him in it.\"\n\n\"Most certainly. And where is the dinner--Uncle Brian's grand dinner--to\ntake place?\"\n\n\"I persuaded him to change it into a public meeting, and give the\nclay-cutters--many of them Mr. Locke Harper's former people, and some\nnow old and poor--a New Year's feast instead. You will see to\nthat, Nathanael?\" And she laid her hand on his arm with rather more\nearnestness than the simple request warranted.\n\nNathanael assented hastily, and spoke of something else.\n\n\"I am rather sorry I asked my brother to meet me here; I forgot he has\nnot been to Thornhurst for so many years.\"\n\n\"It is time then that he came,\" said Anne, gently. \"I shall be very glad\nto see him.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking, her old servant entered, with the announcement\nof \"Major Harper.\"\n\nJust the Major Harper of old--well-dressed, courtly, with his singularly\nhandsome face, and his short dark moustache, sufficient to mark the\nmilitary gentleman without degrading him into the puppy; Major\nHarper with his habitual good-natured smile and faultless bearing, so\ngracefully welcomed, so gaily familiar in London drawing-rooms.--But\nhere?--\n\nHe paused at the door, glanced hastily round the old familiar room, with\nthe known pictures hanging on the walls, and the windows opening on the\nstraight alley of arbutus-trees. His smile grew rather meaningless--he\nhesitated.\n\n\"Will you come to this chair near me? I am very glad to see you, Major\nHarper.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Valery.\"\n\nHe crossed the room to her sofa, Nathanael making way for him. He\njust acknowledged his brother's presence and Agatha's, then took Miss\nValery's extended hand, bowing over it with an attempt at his former\ngrace.\n\n\"I hope I find your health quite re-established? This change to your\nown pleasant house--pleasant as ever, I see\"--he once more glanced round\nit--paused--then altogether broke down. \"It seems but a day since we\nwere children, Anne,\" he said, in a faltering voice.\n\nAgatha and her husband moved away. They respected the one real feeling\nwhich had outlasted all his sentimentalism. For several minutes they\nstood at the far window apart. When Anne called them back, Major Harper\nhad recovered himself, and was sitting by her.\n\n\"Nathanael, our old friend here says you wished to speak with me?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Make haste, then, for I am going to London to-night I have made up my\nmind. I cannot settle here in Dorsetshire.\"\n\n\"Not if it were your father's wish--his last longing desire?\"\n\n\"Anne, for God's sake don't speak of my father.\" He leant his elbow on\nthe table and covered his eyes.\n\nNathanael and Agatha exchanged looks, then both smiled--the happy smile\nof a clear conscience and a heart at rest. \"Tell him now,\" whispered the\nwife to her husband.\n\n\"Brother!\"\n\nMajor Harper lifted up his head.\n\n\"My elder brother!\" And Nathanael offered the hand of peace, which, in\nspite of all outward and necessary association, neither had offered or\ngrasped since Frederick's return to Dorset.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that you are my elder brother--my father's favourite always. If\nhe had lingered but another day he would doubtless have proved that, and\nhave done--what I intend to do, just as if he had himself accomplished\nit. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"No!\" And Major Harper looked thoroughly amazed.\n\n\"Do you see this? which you, either from forgetfulness, or trust in\nme--I had rather believe the latter--left in my hands on that day.\"\nAnd he drew from his pocket the will which had been read. \"You spoke\nof throwing it into Chancery, and there would be scope for a century of\nChancery business here. But I choose rather to respect the honour and\nunity of the family. Therefore, with my wife's entire consent in her\npresence, Anne's and yours, I here do what my father, had he lived,\nwould certainly have done.\"\n\nHe took up the codicil, separated it from the will to which it was\nfastened by seals, and quietly, as if it had been a fragment of\nworthless paper, put it into the fire.\n\n\"Now, Frederick, the original will stands.\"\n\nFrederick sat motionless. He seemed hardly to believe the evidence of\nhis own eyes. He watched the curling, crackling paper with a sort of\nchildish curiosity. When at last it was completely destroyed, he shut\nhis eyes with a great sigh of satisfaction.\n\nMiss Valery softly touched him. \"Major Harper, every brother would not\nhave acted thus.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Just Heavens, no!\" he cried, as the whole fact burst on\nhim, touching his impressible nature to the quick. \"My dear Nathanael!\nMy dear Agatha! God bless you both.\"\n\nHe wrung their hands fervently, and walked to the window, strongly\naffected. The husband and wife remained silent. Anne Valery lay on her\nsofa, and smoothed her thin fingers one over the other with a soft,\ninward smile.\n\n\"How nobly you both act towards me! and I--how have I acted towards\nyou?\" said the elder brother, in deep and real compunction. \"I would\ngive half I possess to undo what has been done, and all through my\ncursed folly and weakness. Do you know that I have lost every penny of\nyour fortune, Agatha?\"\n\n\"Mr. Grimes told me so lately.\"\n\n\"What, only lately? Did you not know before? Did not your husband\"--\n\n\"No,\" she cried, eagerly. \"My husband never betrayed you, even by a\nsingle word. I am glad he did not. I had far rather he had broken my\nheart than his own honour.\"\n\nAnne turned to look at the young face, flushed with feeling; and her\nown, caught something of the glow, though still she spoke not.\n\n\"But,\" said Major Harper, eagerly, addressing his sister-in-law--for\nNathanael sat in one of those passive moods which those who knew him\nwell alone could interpret--\"but my honour must not be broken either. I\nmust redeem all I lost; and I will, to the very last farthing. Only wait\na little, and you shall have no cause to blame me, my poor Agatha!\"\n\n\"Nay, _rich_ Agatha,\" was the murmur that Nathanael heard, as two little\nhands came from behind and alit on his shoulders, like two soft white\ndoves. He caught them, and rose contented, cheerful and brave.\n\n\"No, Frederick, you must dismiss that idea. It is untenable, at least\nfor a long time. My wife and I are going to play at poverty.\" He smiled,\nand drew her nearer to him.\n\n\"Besides,\" said Miss Valery, putting in her quiet voice, to which every\none always listened now, \"I think there are perhaps stronger claims than\nAgatha's on Major Harper.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Anne, tell me what I can do. Anything,\" he added, much moved,\n\"so that my old friends may think well of me. Speak!\"\n\nShe did so, raising herself, though with some exertion, and re-assuming\nthe sensible, straightforward, business-like ways which through her long\nlife of solitary independence had caused Anne Valery to be often called,\nas Duke Dugdale called her, \"such a wise woman!\"\n\n\"I should like very much to see all things settled in the Harper family.\nYour sisters are provided for; Eulalie will be married next year; and\nyou will keep Mary and Elizabeth always with you at Kingcombe Holm.\nPromise that, Frederick.\"\n\nHe assented most energetically.\n\n\"There is no need to fear for these,\" looking affectionately at\nNathanael and his wife. \"Work is good for young people; and I--or\nothers--will always see that they have work enough supplied to bring in\nwherewithal to keep the wolf from their door. For the present, they are\na great deal better poor than rich.\"\n\n\"Thank you, prudent Miss Valery,\" said Nathanael laughing.\n\nShe responded cheerfully, and then turning to Major Harper, went on with\nseriousness:\n\n\"In other instances, much suffering has been caused by your means; and\nI would not have it said that any suffered through the Harper family.\nI have done what I could to prevent this. Matters are mending at Wheal\nCaroline. Nathanael tells me I shall have--that is, there will be--a\nfine flax-harvest there next year.\"\n\nSpeaking of \"next year,\" Anne's voice faltered, but the momentary\nfeebleness passed.\n\n\"Still, there is one thing, Frederick, which nobody can do but you; and\nit is necessary not only to save yourself but to redeem the honour of\nyour house. It will not cost you much--only a few years' retrenchment,\nliving with your sisters at Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\nAgain Major Harper protested there was nothing in the world he would not\ndo for the sake of virtue, and Anne Valery. She drew her desk to her,\nand gave him paper and pen.\n\n\"Write here, that you will pay gradually to certain shareholders I know\nof, the money they lost through trust in your name, and in that of the\nfamily. It is hardly a legal claim, or if it be, they are too poor to\nurge it--but I hold it as a bond of honour. Will you do this, Frederick?\nThen I shall be happy, knowing there is not a single stain on the Harper\nname.\"\n\nIn speaking, she had risen and come beside him, looking faded, wan, and\nold, now that she stood upright, in her black dress, and close cap. Her\nbeauty was altogether of the past, but the moral influence remained.\n\nFrederick Harper took the pen, hesitated, and laid it down. \"I do not\nknow what to write.\"\n\nAnne wrote for him a few plain words, such as a man of honour must\ninevitably hold as binding. He watched idly the movement of the hand\nthat wrote, and the written lines.\n\n\"You have the same slender fingers, Anne, and your writing looks just as\nit used to do,\" he said, in a subdued voice.\n\n\"There, now--sign.\"\n\n\"Sign!--It is like witnessing a will,\" said Major Harper, laughing.\n\n\"I wish you to consider it so,\" returned Anne, in a low voice. \"Consider\nit my last will--my last desire, which you promise to fulfil for me?\"\n\nHe looked at her, took the pen, and signed, his hand trembling; then\nkissed hers.\n\n\"Anne, you know, you were my first love.\"\n\nThe words--said half jesting, yet with a certain mourn-fulness--were\nscarcely out of his lips, than he had quitted the room. They soon heard\nthe clatter of his horse along the avenue. Major Harper was gone out\ninto the busy world again. He never set foot in quiet Thornhurst more.\n\nThe three that were left behind breathed freer--perhaps they would\nhardly have acknowledged it, but it was so.\n\n\"Well, now it is all done,\" said Nathanael, as he drew closer to\nthe sofa where Anne lay--with Agatha performing all sorts of little\nunnoticed cares about her. \"And now I must think about going.\"\n\nNo one asked him where, but Agatha glancing out of the window, thought,\nwith a shiver, of the dreadful sea curving over into boundlessness from\nbehind those hills.\n\n\"I find I must start at once,\" he continued, \"if I would catch the next\nboat to Havre. It sails from Southampton to-morrow morning. I have just\ntime to ride back to Kingcombe and catch the mail train. No, I'll\nnot let you come home with me,\" he added, answering a timid look of\nAgatha's, which seemed to ask, should she come and help him? \"No, dear, I\ncan help myself--such a useful-handed fellow doesn't want a wife even to\npack up for him. And, possibly, if you were with me, I should only find\nit the harder to go. It is rather hard.\"\n\n\"But it is right\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Anne--they had not known she was listening--\"I think it\nis right, or I would not let Nathanael go. And Heaven will take care of\nhim, and bring him safe home to you, Agatha. Be content.\"\n\n\"I was content,\" she said, somewhat lightly. It was a strange thing, but\nyet human nature, that her husband's fits of passionate tenderness only\nseemed to make her own feelings grow calm. Whether it was the shyness of\nher girlhood, or the variableness of a love not spontaneous but\nslowly responsive, or whether--a feeling wrong, yet alas! wondrously\nnatural--it was the mere wilfulness of a woman who knows herself to be\ninfinitely beloved, certain it was that Agatha appeared not quite the\nsame as a few hours before. Affectionate still, and happy, happier\nthan it is the nature of deep love to be; yet there was a something\nwanting--some strong stroke to cleave her heart, and show beyond all\ndoubt what lay at its core. The heart often needs such teaching; and if\nso, surely--most surely it will come.\n\nAgatha followed her husband to the hall. He was grave with his\nleave-taking of Anne Valery, who had looked less cheerful, and had\nbreathed rather than spoken the last \"God bless you!--Come back soon.\"\nThe young man did not again say, even to himself, anything about his\njourney being \"hard.\"\n\nBut as he stood in the hall with his wife, he lingered. Youth is youth,\nand love is love, and each seems so real--life's only reality while\nit lasts. No human being, while drinking the magic cup, ever looks or\nlistens to those who have drank, and set it down empty. Be the history\never so sad, each one thinks, smiling, \"Oh, but I shall be happier than\nthese.\"\n\nNathanael took his wife in his arms to bid her good-bye. She stood,\nlooking down; bashful, reserved, but so fair! And so good likewise--all\nher girlish whims could not hide her heart-goodness. In her whole\ndemeanour was the germ of that noble womanhood which every good man\nwishes his wife to possess, that she may become his heart of hearts,\nthe desired and honoured of his soul, and remain such, long after all\npassion dies. There was one thing only wanting in her--the light which\nplayed waveringly in and out--sometimes flashing so true and warm and\nbright, and then disappearing into clouds and mist. The husband could\nnot catch it--not though his eyes were thirsting for the blessed ray.\n\n\"These few days will seem a long time, Agatha.\"\n\n\"Will they?\"\n\nNathanael took the smiling face between his hands, and looked down, far\ndown, into the brown depths of her eyes.\n\n\"Do you\"--He hesitated. \"I never asked the question before, knowing it\nvain; but now, when I am going away--when\"--\n\nHe paused, the deep passion quivering through his voice.--\"Do you love\nme, Agatha?\"\n\nShe smiled--some insane, wicked influence must have been upon her--but\nshe smiled, hung her head in childish fashion, and whispered, \"I don't\nquite know.\"\n\n\"Well--well!\" He sighed, and after a brief silence bade her good-bye,\nkissed her once, and went towards the door.\n\n\"Ah--don't go yet. I was very foolish. I never, never can be half so\nwise as you. Forgive me.\"\n\n\"Forgive you, my child? Ay, anything.\" And he received her as she ran\ninto his arms, kissing her again tenderly, with a sad earnestness that\nalmost increased his love.\n\n\"Now I must go, my darling wife. Take care of yourself, and good-bye.\"\n\nSo they parted. Agatha went in dry-eyed; then locked herself in the\nlibrary, and cried violently and long.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\"They are sure to be home to-morrow; nothing can prevent their being\nhome to-morrow,\" said Agatha, as she read over neither for the first\ntime, nor the second, nor the third, her husband's letter, received from\nHavre.\n\nIt was night now, and they were sitting by the fire in Miss Valery's\ndressing-room. It had been one of Anne's best days; a wonderfully good\nday; she had walked about the house, and given several orders to her\ndelighted servants, who, old as they were, would have obeyed the most\nonerous commands for the pleasure of seeing their mistress strong enough\nto give them. Some, however, wondered why she should be so particular\nabout the order of a house that never was in disorder, and especially\nwhy various furniture arrangements which had gradually in the course of\ntime been altered, should be pertinaciously restored, so that all things\nmight look just as they did years and years ago. Also, though it was\na few days in advance of the orthodox day, she would have the house\nadorned with \"Christmas,\" until it looked a perfect bower.\n\n\"It do seem, Mrs. Harper,\" said the old housekeeper, confidentially--\"it\ndo seem just as on the last merry Christmas, afore the family was broke\nup, and Mr. Frederick turned soldier, and Mr. Locke Harper--that's his\nuncle--went away with little Master Nathanael, Mr. Locke Harper as is\nnow.\"\n\nAnd Agatha had laughed very heartily at the idea of her husband being\n\"little Master Nathanael;\" but she had not told this conversation to\nAnne Valery.\n\nAll afternoon the house had been oppressively lively, thanks to a visit\nfrom the Dugdale children; which little elves were sent out of the way\nwhile their mother performed the not unnecessary duty of putting her\nestablishment in order. For Harrie was determined that her house,\nand none other, should have the honour of receiving Uncle Brian. As\nNathanael had taken for granted the same thing, and as Mary Harper had\nlikewise communicated her opinion, that it was against all etiquette for\nher poor father's only brother to be welcomed anywhere but at Kingcombe\nHolm, there seemed likely to be a tolerable family fight over the\npossession of the said Uncle Brian.\n\nThe little Dugdales had talked of him incessantly all day, communicating\ntheir expectations concerning him in such a funny fashion that Agatha\nwas ready to die with laughing, and even Anne, who had insisted on\nhaving the children about her, was heard to laugh sometimes. She let\nlittle Brian climb about her sofa, and answered all sorts of eccentric\nquestions from the others, never seeming weary. At last, when the sound\nof merry, young voices had died out of the house, and its large, lofty\nrooms grew solemn with the wailing of the wind, Anne had retreated to\nher dressing-room, where she sat watching the fire-light, or answering\nin fragments to Agatha's conversation.\n\nThis conversation was wandering enough; catching up various topics, and\nthen letting them drop like broken threads, but all winding themselves\ninto one and the same subject \"They will be home to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I hope, nay, I am sure of it, God willing!\" said Anne, softly. \"He\noften puts hindrances in our way, but in the end He always works things\nround, and we see them clearly afterwards. Still we ought hardly to\nsay even of the strongest love or dearest wish we have, 'It _must_\nbe!' without also saying 'God willing.'\"\n\nAgatha replied not. This was a new doctrine for her. How rarely in her\nyoung, passionless, sorrowless life, she had thought of the few words,\noft used in cant, and Agatha hated all cant--\"the will of God.\" She\npondered over them much.\n\n\"What sort of a night is it\" said Anne, at length.\n\n\"Very dreary and rainy, and the wind is high.\"\n\n\"No matter, it will not reach them. The _Ardente_ will be safe in\nSouthampton-water by this time.\"\n\nAgatha recurred to the perpetual letter; \"Yes, so my husband tells me\nhere.\"\n\n\"And therefore,\" Miss Valery continued, laying her hand over the paper,\n\"his good little wife shall fold up this, and not weary herself any more\nwith anxiety about him. Those who love ought above all others to trust\nin the love of God.\"\n\nAfter this they sat patient and content--nay, oftentimes quite merry,\nfor Agatha strove hard to amuse her companion. And the wind sang its\nsong without--not threateningly, but rather in mirth; and the fire\nburnt brightly, within. And no one thought of them but as friends and\nservants--the terrible Wind, the devouring Fire.\n\nIt was growing late, and Agatha began to use the petty tyranny with\nwhich Miss Valery had invested her, insisting on her friend's going to\nbed.\n\n\"I will presently; only give me time--a little time. I am not so young\nas you, my child, and have not so many hours to waste in sleeping. There\nnow, I'll be good. Wait--you see I am already pulling down my hair.\"\n\nShe did so, rather feebly. It fell on her shoulders longer and thicker\nthan any one would have believed--it was really beautiful, except for\nthose broad white streaks.\n\n\"What soft fine hair,\" cried Agatha, admiringly. \"Ah, you shall go\nwithout caps in the spring--I declare you shall.\"\n\n\"Not at my age.\"\n\n\"That cannot be so very ancient. I shouldn't mind asking you the direct\nquestion, for I am sure you are not one of those foolish women who are\nashamed to tell their age, as if any number of years matters while we\nkeep a young warm heart.\"\n\n\"I am thirty-nine or forty, I forget which,\" said Anne, as she drew\nher fingers through the long locks, gazing down on them with some\npensiveness. \"I myself never liked hair of this colour, neither brown\nnor black; but mine was always soft and smooth, and some people used to\nthink it _pretty_ once.\"\n\n\"It is pretty now. You will always be beautiful, dear, dear Anne! I\nwill call you Anne, for you are scarcely older than I, except in a few\ncontemptible years not worth mentioning,\" continued the girl, sturdily.\n\"And I will have you as happy, too, as I.\"\n\nAnne sat silent a minute or two, the hair dropping over her face. Then\nshe raised it and looked into the fire with a calm sweet look that\nAgatha thought perfectly divine.\n\n\"I have been happy,\" she said. \"That is I have not been unhappy--God\nknows I have not. I have had a great deal to do always, and in all my\nlabour was there profit. It comforted me, and helped to comfort others;\nit made me feel that my life was not wholly thrown away, as many an\nunmarried woman's is, but as no one's ever need be.\"\n\n\"But some are. Think of Jane Ianson, of whom Emma wrote me word\nyesterday. If ever any woman spent a mournful, useless life, and died of\na broken heart, it was poor Jane Ianson.\"\n\n\"Her story was pitiful, but she somewhat erred,\" Anne answered,\nthoughtfully. \"No human being _ought_ to die of a 'broken heart' (as the\nphrase is) while God is in His heaven, and has work to be done upon His\nearth. There are but two things that can really throw a lasting shadow\nover woman's existence--an unworthy love, and a lost love. The first\nought to be rooted out at all risks; for the other--let it stay! There\nare more things in life than mere marrying and being happy. And for\nlove--a high, pure, holy love, held ever faithful to one object,\"--and\nas she spoke, Anne's whole face lightened and grew young--\"no fortune or\nmisfortune--no time or distance--no power either in earth or heaven can\nalter _that_.\"\n\nThere was a pause, during which the two women sat silent and grave. And\nthe wind howled round the house, and the fire crackled harmlessly in the\nchimney, but they noticed neither--the fierce Wind--the awful Fire.\n\n\"It is a wild night,\" said Agatha at last. \"But they are landed at\nSouthampton long ago. Last night was lovely--such a moon! and they were\nsure to sail, because the _Ardente_ only plies once a week, and there\nis no other boat this winter-time. Oh, yes! they are quite safe in\nSouthampton. I shouldn't wonder if they were both here to breakfast\nto-morrow.\"\n\nAnd Agatha, with her little heart beating quick, merrily, and fast,\nnever thought to look at her companion. Anne's eyes were dilated, her\nlips quivering--all her serenity was gone.\n\n\"To-morrow--to-morrow,\" she murmured, and as with a sudden pain, put\nher hand to her chest, breathing hard and rapidly. \"Agatha, hold me\nfast--don't let me go--just for a little while.--I _cannot_ go!\"\n\nShe clung to the young girl with a pallid, frightened aspect, like one\nwho looks down into a place of darkness, and shudders on its verge.\nNever before had that expression been seen in Anne Valery. Slowly it\npassed away, leaving the calmness that was habitual to her. Agatha hung\nround her neck, and kissed her into smiles.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, rising, \"let us both go to bed. You look tired, my\nchild, and we must have your very best looks when you make breakfast for\n_them_ in the morning. That is, if they both come here.\"\n\n\"They will come--my husband says so. He knows, and is determined that\nUncle Brian shall know--everything.\"\n\nAnne sat still--so still, that her young companion was afraid she had\nvexed her.\n\n\"No, dear--not vexed. But no human being can know everything! It lies\nbetween him and me--and God.\"\n\nSo saying, she rose, fastened up the long hair in which the last\nlingering beauty of her youth lay--put on her little close cap, and was\nagain the composed gentle lady of middle age.\n\nShe rung for the housekeeper, and gave various orders for the morning,\ndesiring a few trivial additions to the breakfast, which would have made\nAgatha smile, but that she noted a slight hesitation in the voice that\nordered them.\n\n\"Is there anything your husband would like especially? I don't quite\nunderstand his ways.\"\n\nAgatha blushed as she answered--\"Nor I.\"\n\n\"You will not answer so in a few months hence,\" said Anne, when they\nwere alone. \"It is a very unromantic doctrine, but few young wives know\nhow much the happiness of a home depends on little things--that is, if\nanything can be little which is done for _his_ comfort, and is pleasant\nto _him_. There's a lecture for you, Mistress Agatha. Now go to bed, and\nrise in the morning to begin a new era, as the happiest and best wife in\nall England.\"\n\n\"I will,\" cried Agatha, laughing, though with a tear or two in her eyes.\nTo think how much Anne had guessed of the wretched past, yet, with true\ndelicacy, how entirely she had concealed that knowledge!\n\nThey embraced silently, and then Miss Valery went into her own room,\nwhere, year after year, when all the duties and cheerfulness of the day\nwere done, the solitary woman had shut herself in--alone with her own\nheart and with God. The young wife stood and looked with thoughtful\nreverence at the closed door of that room.\n\nIt was eleven o'clock, yet somehow Mrs. Harper did not feel inclined to\ngo to bed. She had too many things to think of, too many plans to make\nand resolutions to form. Her life must settle itself calmly now. Its\ntrouble, tumult, and uncertainty were over. She felt quite sure of her\nhusband's goodness--of his deep and tender love for herself--nay, also\nof her own for him--only that was a different sort of feeling. She\nthought less on this than on the other side of the subject--how sweet it\nwas to be so dear to him. She would try and deserve him more--be to him\na faithful wife and a good house-wife, and make herself happy in his\ndevotion.\n\nShe smiled as she passed through the hall where he had stood and said,\n\"Do you love me?\" She wished she had frankly answered \"Yes,\" as was\nindeed the truth; only his strong love had lately made her own seem so\npoor and weak.\n\nLingering on the spot which his feet had last pressed, she tried to\nfancy him beside her, and acted the scene over again, \"making believe,\"\nchildish fashion, that she stood on tiptoe attempting to reach up to\nhis mouth--a very long way!--and there breathing out the \"Yes\" in a\nperfectly justifiable and unquestionable fashion. And then she laughed\nat her own conceit--the foolish little wife!--and tripped off into the\ndrawing-room, lest the old butler, who always went round the house at\nmidnight to see that all was safe, might catch her at her antics.\nStill, were they not quite natural? Was she not a very happy and\nfondly-worshipped wife? and was not her husband coming home the next\nmorning?\n\nEntering the drawing-room, her high spirits were somewhat sobered\ndown; its atmosphere felt so gloomy and cold. The fire had nearly died\nout--the ill-natured fire, that did not know there was a cheerful little\nwoman coming to sit beside it and dream of all sorts of pleasant things.\n\n\"I wish fires would never go out,\" said Agatha, rather crossly; and\nshe stirred it, and blew it, and cherished it, as if it were the only\npleasant companion in this dreary room.\n\n\"How I do love fire,\" she said at last, as she sat down on the\nhearth-rug and warmed her little feet and hands by the blaze, and would\nnot look in the dark corners of the room, but kept her face turned from\nthem, as during her life she had kept it turned away from all gloomy\nsubjects. Passionate anguish of her own making, she had known; but that\nstern, irremediable sorrow which comes direct from the unseen Mover of\nall things and lays its heavy hand on the sufferer's head, saying, \"Be\nstill, and know that I am God\"--this teaching, which must come to every\nhuman soul that is worth its destiny, had never yet come to Agatha\nHarper.\n\nWas it this unknown something even now tracking her, that made her long\nfor the familiar daylight, and feel afraid of night, with its silence,\nits solitude, and its dark?\n\n\"I will go to bed and try to sleep,\" she said. \"It is but a few hours.\nMy husband is certain to be here in the morning.\"\n\nShe rose, laughed at herself for starting on some slight noise in the\nquiet house--old Andrews locking up the front door, probably--snuffed\nher candle to make it as bright as possible, and prepared to go\nup-stairs.\n\nA light knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in, Andrews. The fire is all safe, and I shall vanish now.\"\n\nShe said this without looking round. When she did look she was somewhat\nsurprised to see, not the butler, but Marmaduke Dugdale. It was odd,\ncertainly, but then Duke had such very odd ways, and was always turning\nup at impossible hours and in eccentric fashion. He looked eccentric\nenough now, being thoroughly drenched with rain, with a queer, scared\nexpression on his face.\n\nAgatha was amused by it. \"Why, what a late visitor! The children are\ngone home hours ago, though they waited ever so long for 'Pa.' Have you\nbeen all this while at Mr. Trenchard's?\"\n\n\"I haven't been there at all.\"\n\nAgatha smiled.\n\n\"Don't'ee laugh--now don't'ee, Mrs. Harper.\" And Duke sat down, pushing\nthe dripping hair from his forehead, pulling his face into all sorts of\ncontortions, until at last it sunk between his hands, and those clear,\nhonest, always beautiful eyes, alone confronted her. There was that in\ntheir expression which startled Agatha.\n\n\"What did you come for so late, Mr. Dugdale?\"\n\n\"What did I come for?\" he vaguely repeated. \"Now don't'ee tremble so. We\nmust hope for the best, my child.\"\n\nAgatha felt a sudden stoppage at the heart which took away her.\nbreath. \"Tell me--quick; I shall not be frightened;--he is coming home\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear child!\" muttered Duke again, as he held out his hands to her,\nand she saw that tears were dropping over his cheeks.\n\nAgatha clutched at the hands threateningly--she felt herself going wild.\n\"Tell me, I say. If you don't--I'll\"------\n\n\"Hush--I'll tell you--only hush!--think of poor Anne! And there's hope\nyet. Only they have not come into Southampton-roads--and last night\nthere was a fire seen far out at sea--and it might have been a ship, you\nknow.\"\n\nThus disconnectedly Marmaduke broke his terrible news. Agatha received\nthem with a wild stare.\n\n\"It's impossible--totally impossible,\" she cried, uttering sounds\nthat were half shrieking, half laughter. \"Absolutely, ridiculously\nimpossible. I'll not believe it--not a word. It's impossible--\n_impossible!_\"\n\nAnd gasping out that one word, over and over again, fiercely and fast,\nshe walked up and down the room like one distraught. She was indeed\nquite mad. She had not any sense of anything. She never once thought\nof weeping, or fainting, or doing anything but shriek out to earth\nand Heaven that one denunciation--that such a thing was and must\nbe--\"_impossible!_\"\n\nMarmaduke caught her--she flung him aside.\n\n\"Don't touch me--don't speak to me! I say it's _impossible!_\"\n\n\"Child!\" And his look became more grave and commanding than any one\nwould have believed of the Dugdale. \"Dare not to say impossible! It is\nsinning against God.\"\n\nAgatha stopped in her frenzied walk. Of a sudden came the horrible\nthought that _it might be_--that the hand might have been lifted--have\nfallen, striking the whole world from her at one blow.\n\n\"Oh God!--oh merciful God!\"\n\nIn that cry, scarcely louder than a moan, yet strong and wild enough to\npierce the heavens, Agatha knew how she loved her husband. Not calmly,\nnot meekly, but with that terrible love which is to the heart as life\nitself.\n\nOf the next few minutes that passed over her no one could write--no one\nwould dare. It was utter insanity, yet with a perfect knowledge of\nits state. Madness, stone-blind, stone-deaf--that uttered no cry, and\npoured out no tears. She walked swiftly up and down the room, her hands\nclenched, her features rigid as iron. Mr. Dugdale and old Andrews could\nonly watch pitifully, saying at times--which may all good Christians say\nlikewise!--\"God have mercy upon her.\"\n\nNo one else came near--the servants were all asleep, and Miss Valery's\nroom was in another part of the house. Possibly she slept too--poor\nAnne!\n\n\"Now,\" said Agatha, in a cold, hard voice, clutching Marmaduke's arm,\n\"I want to know all about it. I don't believe it, mind you!--not one\nword--but I would like to hear. Just tell me. How did you get the news?\"\n\n\"From Southampton, to-night. It happened last night A steamer saw the\nburning ship, and went, but the fire had already reached to the water's\nedge. There was not a soul in or near the wreck when it went down.\"\n\nAgatha shuddered, and then said, in the same hard voice: \"It was some\nother ship--not the _Ardente_.\"\n\nMarmaduke shook his head, drearily. \"They found a spar with 'Ardente'\nupon it. But they saw no boats, and some people think, as there were but\nfew passengers, they all got safe off, and may reach the shore.\"\n\n\"Of course they will!--I was sure of that;\" returned Agatha, in the same\nwild, determined tone. \"Let me see! it was a quiet night. I stood a long\ntime looking at the moon--Ah!\"\n\nThe ghastly thought of her standing there looking up at the moon, and\nthe pitiless moon looking down on the sea and on him! Agatha's senses\nreeled--she burst into the most awful laughter.\n\nMarmaduke held her fast--the whimsical absent Marmaduke--now roused into\nhis true character, kind, as any woman, and wiser than most men.\n\n\"Agatha, you must be quiet. It is wicked ever to despair. There is a\nchance--more than a chance, that your husband has been saved. He has\ninfinite presence of mind, and he is a young, strong, likely lad. But\nBrian--poor Brian! my dear old friend!\"\n\nDuke Dugdale's bravery gave way--he was of such a gentle, tender heart.\nThe sight of his emotion stilled Agatha's frenzy, and made it more like\na natural grief, though it was hard yet--hard as stone.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, taking his hand, and smiling piteously--\"come--don't\ncry. I can't!--not for the world. Let us talk. What are you going to\ndo?\"\n\n\"I am going right off to Southampton--whence they have sent steamers out\nin all directions to pick up the boats, if they are drifting anywhere\nabout the Channel. Fancy--to be out in the open sea, this winter-time,\nwith possibly no clothes or food!\"\n\n\"Hush!\"--shuddered Agatha's low voice--\"hush! or I shall go quite mad,\nand I would rather not just yet--_afterwards_, I shall not mind.\"\n\n\"Poor child!\"\n\n\"Don't now,\" and she shrank from him. \"Never think of me--_that_ does\nnot signify. Only something must be done. No weeping--no talking--_do_\nsomething!\"\n\n\"I told you I should. I am going\"--\n\n\"Go then!\" Her quick speech--the wild stamp of her foot--poor child, how\nmad she was still!\n\nMr. Dugdale took no notice except by a compassionate look--perhaps\nhe, too, felt there was no time to lose. He went towards the door--she\nfollowing.\n\n\"I am off now--I shall catch the train in two hours,\" said he,\nspringing on his horse in the dark wet night. \"Harrie will be with you\ndirectly--only she thought I had better come first. Go in--go in--my\npoor child.\"\n\nAgatha obeyed mechanically, for the moment She walked about the house,\nin at one room and out at another, meeting no person--for Andrews had\ngone to call up some of the servants. The heavy quiet around stifled\nher. Faster and faster she walked--clutching her hands on her throat for\nbreath--sometimes uttering, with a sort of laughing shriek, the one word\nin which seemed her only salvation--\"Impossible!--utterly and entirely\nimpossible!\"\n\nShe sat down for a moment, trying to think over more clearly the chances\nof the case--but to keep still was beyond her power. She resumed that\nrapid walk as if she were flying through an atmosphere of invisible\nfiends. It felt like it.\n\nOnce, by a superhuman effort, she drove her mind to contemplate the\n_possible_--the winds, the flames, the waves, and him struggling among\nthem. She saw the face which she had last seen so life-like--as a _dead\nface_, with its pale, pure features and fair hair. And even that face\nnever to be again seen by her through any possible chance! For him to\nbe blotted out altogether from the world, and she left therein! \"Oh,\nGod--oh, God!\" The despairing, accusing shriek that she sent up to His\nmercy!--May His mercy have received and forgiven it!\n\nShe began to count up the hours that must pass before she could receive\nany tidings, good or ill. To stay quietly in the house and wait for\nthem!--you might as well have told a poor wretch to sit still and wait\nfor the bursting of a mine. No rest--no rest. The very walls of the\nhouse seemed to press upon her and hem her in. She saw a bonnet and\nshawl hanging up in the hall, caught both, and ran out at the front\ndoor.\n\nOut--out under the stars. She walked with her face lifted right up to\nthem, her eyes flashing out an insane defiance to their merciless calm.\nThe rain fell down thick, and it was very cold, but she never thought\nof putting on the bonnet or the shawl; or, if she thought at all, it was\nwith a sort of longing that the rain might come and cool her through and\nthrough, or the sharp wind pierce to her breast and kill her. Once she\nhad a thought of running a mile or two across the hills, and leaping\nfrom some cliffs into the sea; so that, whichever way this suspense\nended, she might be safely dead beforehand--dead, too, in the same\nocean, washed by the same wave. All the foolish Romeo-and-Juliet-like\ntraditions of people killing themselves on some beloved's tomb, seemed\nto her now perfectly real, possible, and natural. Nothing was unnatural\nor impossible--save living.\n\nHow to live, even for a day, an hour, in this horrible, deathly\nstagnation, she did not know. At last, walking on blindly through the\nnight, she came to the termination of the Thornhurst estate. Was she to\ngo back and lull herself into the stupor of patience?--to be kissed\nand wept over, and preached resignation to?--left to sit mutely in\nthat quiet house, while he was dashed about, fighting with the sea for\nlife?--or watching the clock's travelling round hour after hour, not\nknowing but that every peaceful minute might be the terrible one in\nwhich he died?\n\n\"No,\" she said to herself, while the awful but delirious joy which has\nstruck many in a similar position, struck her suddenly, \"he is not dead.\nIf he had died, he would have told me--me whom he so loved He could\nnot die anywhere, or at any time, but in some way or other I should\ncertainly have known it.\"\n\nAnd as she stood in the dark road--quite alone with the hills and stars,\ncalmed down into a supernatural awe, Agatha almost expected to see her\nhusband stand before her in the old familiar likeness. She would not\nhave been afraid.\n\nBut no apparition came. All nature, visible and invisible, was silent\nto her misery. If she went back to the house, all there would be silent\ntoo.\n\nShe took her resolution--though it could hardly be called a resolution,\nbeing merely the blind impulse of despair. She climbed over the\ngate--she had not wit enough to unfasten it--and ran, swift and silent\nas some wild animal, along the road to Kingcombe.\n\nThe rain ceased, and her dripping clothes dried of themselves, so as not\nto encumber her movements. By some happy chance her feet were well shod,\nand now, gathering her wits as she went, she put on the shawl--not the\nbonnet, her head burned so, and felt so wild Just then, far into the\ndarkness, she heard wheels rolling and rolling. It was Mrs. Dugdale\ndriving along rapidly towards Thornhurst--but without one slash of the\nwhip or one word of conversation with Dunce. When she stopped to open a\ngate the glare of the chaise-lamps showed the little black figure by the\nroadside. Harrie screamed--she thought it was a ghost.\n\n\"Any news? any news?\"\n\n\"Gracious! is it you, child? No news--none! Get up, quick, and come\nhome.\"\n\nBut Agatha fled on and on, noticing nothing, except once, when with a\nstart she saw the great black outline of Corfe Castle looming against\nthe night-sky.\n\n[Illustration: Along the road page 394]\n\nWhen she reached Kingcombe, it was still dark. She could not even have\nfound her way, save for the faint sky brightness lent by the overcast\nmoon; and the distance she had traversed was all but miraculous.\nIt seemed as if she had not walked by natural feet, but some unseen\ninfluence had drawn and lifted her the whole way. When she stood in\nKingcombe streets she hardly believed her senses--save that nothing\nwas hard of belief just then, except the one horror--incredible,\nunutterable.\n\nMr. Dugdale was walking up and down Kingcombe railway station, waiting\nfor the early train. One or two sleepy porters were eyeing him with\na sort of pitying curiosity, for ill news spreads fast in a country\nneighbourhood. There was no one else about. Nobody perceived a little\nfigure creeping up the road and coming on the platform. Even Marmaduke\ndid not lift his eyes or relax his melancholy walk until something\ntouched him on the arm. He stood astonished.\n\n\"It is I, you see. You are not gone yet.\"\n\n\"How did you come--you poor child?\"\n\n\"From Thornhurst--I walked. But how soon shall you start?\"\n\n\"Walked from Thornhurst!--at this time of night!\" said one of the\nrailway-men, who knew the family--as indeed did every one in the\nneighbourhood. \"Lord help us--it's that poor Mrs. Harper!\"\n\nMr. Dugdale tried to remove Agatha from the platform, but she resisted.\n\n\"I am come to go with you to Southampton.\"\n\n\"What need of that? Go back to my house, poor child. If anything is to\nbe done I can do it. If nothing--why\"--\n\n\"I _will_ go.\"\n\nThe determination was so calm, the grasp of the little hand so strong,\nthat her brother-in-law urged no more. He went in his quiet way to take\nher ticket, the railway folk moving respectfully aside, and whispering\namong themselves something about \"poor Mrs. Harper, that was going to\nSouthampton to see after her husband.\"\n\nComing back, Duke attempted not to talk to her, but stood by her\nside--she would stand--sometimes feeling at her damp shawl, or wrapping\nher up in the tender careful fashion that he used to his own little\nones. At last the great fiery eye, accompanied by the iron beast's\nsnorting gasps, appeared far in the dark. Agatha drew a long breath,\nlike a sob.\n\nMr. Dugdale lifted her in the carriage, almost without a word. One of\nthe railway-men brought from somewhere--nobody ever learned where--a rug\nfor her feet, and a pillow for her head to lean on. A minute more, and\nthey were whirled away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nEvery one knows that story, perhaps the most terrible of its kind for\nmany years--and Heaven grant! for many more to come--when a noble ship,\nwith her full complement of human beings, fought at once with winds, and\nwaves, and fire, until came down upon it, and upon all the homes which\nthat one hour desolated, the certain doom. One shudders even at writing\nof such things, save that they must of necessity happen, and not rarely.\nBut for one such tale as that of the _Amazon_, which convulses a whole\nkingdom with horror, there must be many unknown chronicles of equal\ndread, save that the little vessel sinks unnoticed into its sea grave,\nand the destruction carried with it passes not beyond its own immediate\nsphere. Such was the case with the Ardente.\n\nWhen the train neared Southampton it was already bright morning.\nEverybody was moving about on the solid, safe, sunshiny earth--nobody\nthought of shipwrecks and disasters at sea. Many a one looked lazily\nat the glittering Southampton-water; no one dreamed how, far beyond the\ncurving line of horizon, human beings--husbands and brothers--might be\nfloating about without food or water, frozen, thirsting, dying or dead,\nunder the same sunny sky.\n\nPassing the spot where the wide reach of bay opens, Marmaduke quickly\ndrew down the carriage-blind. He would not for worlds that the poor\nAgatha should look at that merry-glancing, cruel sea. She seemed to\nnotice the movement, and stirred from the corner where she had sat\nduring all the journey, motionless, save for her perpetually open eyes.\n\n\"How light it is! quite morning!\"\n\nMarmaduke turned, felt her pulse, and began softly chafing her cold\nhand.\n\n\"Don't, now,\" she said piteously. \"Don't be kind to me--please don't!\nTalk a little. Tell me what you think it best to do first.\"\n\nThe sharp-lined, worn face, not pallid, or without consciousness--some\npeople, to their misery, never can lose consciousness--mournfully did\nworthy Duke regard it! But he did not say a word of sympathy; he knew\nshe could not bear it. Her physical powers were so tightly strung that\nthe least soft touch would make them give way altogether.\n\nMr. Dugdale stated briefly, and as if it had been the most\nmatter-of-fact thing in the world, how he meant to go to the owners of\nthe _Ardente_ and get the first tidings of her there; how, if neither\nthat nor any rumours he could catch in and about the docks, were\nsatisfactory, he should hire a small steamer and beat up and down\nChannel, calling in at all the ports where it was likely boats might\nhave been picked up.\n\n\"They would be, probably, in twenty-four hours or so. If we don't hear\nin three days--three days at this time of year\"--he stopped with a\nperceptible shudder--\"then, Agatha,\" and Duke's gentle voice grew\ngentler, and solemn like a psalm, \"then, my child, we'll go home.\"\n\nAgatha bowed her head. Bodily exhaustion calmed her mind, and soothed\nher into a feeling which made even the last dread alternative less\nfearful. She felt a conviction that such \"going home\" would only be a\nprelude to the last going home of all, when she should never part from\nher husband more. She did not much mind now, even if all were to end so.\nPerhaps it would be best.\n\nThey got out of the carriage. All her limbs were cramped--she could\nhardly stand. Mr. Dugdale took her unresisting, to a quiet inn he knew,\nand there made her lie down and take food. Somehow, even in the last\nextremity, Duke Dugdale could win people over to do his pleasure, which\nwas always for their own good.. He sat by her and talked, but only for\na few minutes--he had no thought of wasting even in kindness the time on\nwhich might hang life or death.\n\n\"I am going now, and you must stay here till my return, which is sure\nnot to be for at least two hours.\"\n\n\"Two hours!--Oh, take me with you!\"\n\nDuke shook his head. \"You would only hinder me, I fear. See there, now!\"\n\nTrying to rise and cross the parlour, she had nearly fallen. A drowsy\nweakness stole over her--she let her good brother have his own way\nentirely. Very soon she found herself alone in the parlour, lying in the\ndusky light of closed blinds, with the dull murmur creeping up from the\nstreet--lying quietly in a state of passive patience.\n\nNo human brain can endure a great strain of mental anguish long. A\nmerciful numbness usually seizes it, in which everything grows hazy\nand unreal, and consequently painless. Agatha felt convinced she was\nhalf-asleep, and that she should wake up in her own room at Thorn-hurst\nor at Kingcombe, and find out everything to be a dream. Or even granting\nits reality, she seemed to view the whole story like some unconcerned\nperson, or some being from whom this troubled world had passed away, and\ngrown less than nothing and vanity. She gazed down upon herself as it\nwere from a great height, thinking how sad a story it was, and how\nit would have grieved herself to hear it of any one else. But all her\nthoughts were disconnected and unnatural. The only tangible feeling\nwas a sort of comfort in remembering the last day they had spent\ntogether--in thinking how he loved her, and that, living or dying, he\nwould know how she loved him now.\n\nIn this state she lay for an indefinite time--a period that had no human\nmeasurement. It seemed at once a day and a moment. No counted time could\never appear so like eternity.\n\nAt last there was a hand upon the door. Mr. Dugdale had come back.\nAgatha started up, and sat frozen. For her life she could not have\nuttered a sound. He took her hand, saying, gently:\n\n\"My dear child!\"\n\nSurely he could not have spoken so, if--No, in that case his lips would\nhave been paralysed, like her own.\n\n\"We must bear up yet, little sister. There is a chance.\"\n\nThe flood broke forth. Agatha flung herself on the sofa-cushions,\nsobbing, weeping, and laughing at once. Duke patted her on the shoulder,\nwalked round her, stood eyeing her with his mild, investigating look, as\nif he were pondering some great new problem in human nature. Finally, he\nsat down beside her, and cried likewise.\n\nAgatha for the first time spoke naturally. \"Thank you, brother--you are\na very good brother to me. Now, tell me everything.\"\n\n\"Everything is but little. It's like hanging on a thread--but we'll hold\non.\"\n\n\"We will,\" said Agatha, setting her lips together, and sitting down\nfirmly to listen. She was in her right senses now. She had undergone the\nshock, and risen from it another woman.\n\n\"I wish you would make haste and tell me. You don't know how quiet I am\nnow, nor how much I can bear--only tell me.\"\n\nMarmaduke began, speaking in fragments hurriedly put together, looking\nsteadily down on his hands, using a brief business tone--just as if\nevery syllable had not been planned by him on his way back, so that the\ntidings might fall most gradually on the poor wife's ear.\n\n\"It was indeed the Ardente. Four sailors were picked up yesterday, in\none of her boats. They say it's likely that others may have got off in\nthe same way.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" That wild sob of thanksgiving! Marmaduke seemed to dread it more\nthan despair. He hastily added:\n\n\"But they had many things against them. The fire happened at midnight.\nWhen it broke out there was no one on deck but one passenger, walking\nup and down. He was a young man, the sailors say, tall, with long light\nhair.\"\n\nThe speaker's voice faltered; he could not bear to see the misery he\ninflicted. At last Agatha motioned to hear more.\n\n\"One sailor remembers him particularly, because during all the tumult he\nwas almost the only person who seemed to have his wits about him. He was\nseen everywhere--getting out the boats, quieting the passengers--doing\nit all, the man says, as steadily as if he had been in his own house on\nshore, instead of in a burning ship. If there was any one likely to have\nsaved his own life and the lives of others, the sailors think it must be\nthat young man.\"\n\n\"When did they see him last?\"\n\n\"Not five minutes before the ship went down. He was in a boat with\nseveral more. They think it was he because of his light hair. He was\nleaning over towards a floating spar, helping in a woman and child.\"\n\n\"Ah, then it was he! It was my husband!\" cried Agatha, clasping her\nhands, while her countenance glowed like that of some Roman wife, who,\ndearer even than his life, esteemed her husband's honour.\n\n\"I believe,\" she said, as that rapture faded, and the natural pang\nreturned--\"I firmly believe that he has been saved. God would not let\nhim perish. He must have got safe off from the wreck in that boat. Don't\nyou think he has?\"\n\nDuke could not meet those eager eyes; he fidgeted in his seat, looked\ndown on his hands, and told them over, finger by finger. At last\nhe said, with that peculiar upward look which, amidst all his\neccentricities, showed the beautiful serenity of a righteous man--a man\nwho \"walked with God:\"\n\n\"Child, we can none of us be certain either way. We can only do all that\nlies in human power, and leave the event in the hand of One who is wiser\nand more loving than us all.\"\n\nAgatha bowed her head, and her heart with it, almost to the dust. She\nremembered Anne Valery's saying--how much those who loved have need to\ntrust in God. Poor Anne! Never until this minute had any one thought of\nAnne at home at Thornhurst. Shocked at the selfishness that often comes\nwith great misery, Agatha cried eagerly:\n\n\"Did you hear anything about Uncle Brian?\"\n\n\"No--nothing.\" The quick, husky tone, as Marmaduke turned and walked\naway, betrayed how keenly the good man suffered, though he never spoke\nof any sufferings but Agatha's. She was deeply touched.\n\n\"Take hope,\" she said earnestly. \"He will be saved. My husband would\nnever forsake Uncle Brian.\"\n\n\"I know that; but then Nathanael is young, and has something to live\nfor, while Brian is getting on in years--older than I am.--I should like\nto have seen him again, and have shown him little Brian; but--well\nit's a strange world! Heaven's mercy is sure to give us a life to come,\nperhaps many lives--if only to make clear the hard mysteries of this. I\nshould like to have talked that matter over once again with poor Brian.\"\n\nAnd Duke seemed wandering into his mild, dreamy philosophies, till\nAgatha recalled him.\n\n\"Now, what is to be done? You said, if we heard nothing, the boats must\nbe drifting about somewhere in the Channel\"--she shivered--\"and then we\nwould take a little steamer, and go and look for them?\"\n\n\"I know. She's getting ready.\"\n\n\"That is right. Then we will go on board at once,\" said Agatha, with\ndecision. She, who a week ago would have been terrified at the bare\nthought of setting her foot on the deck of any vessel!\n\n\"Poor little delicate thing,\" muttered Duke, watching her. \"It will be\na rough sea to-night, and we may be a day or two in getting round the\ncoast. You had better go home, Agatha.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Somebody once told me you had never been at sea in your life; and in\nwinter-time this Dorset coast is rough always, sometimes dangerous.\"\n\n\"Dangerous! and he is there!\" She began tying on her bonnet, hastily,\nbut steadily, as steadily as if preparing for an every-day walk. \"Now, I\nam quite ready. Let us start.\"\n\nHer brother made no more objections, but took her through the busy\nSouthampton streets. Once, on the quay, two lounging sailors touched\ntheir hats to Mr. Dugdale, and Agatha heard a whisper of \"Belongs to\nsome o' the poor fellows as went down in the _Ardente_.\" She shuddered,\nas if there were already upon her the awful sign of widowhood.\n\n--The wide Southampton harbour, with the crafts of all nations gliding\nto and fro upon it--the bustle of the landing and embarking place--the\nhurrying crowd, eager after their own business, none thinking of the\none little vessel suddenly whelmed in that wondrous sea-highway, ever\nthronged, yet ever lonely, or of the wrecked crew drifting hither and\nthither, no one knew where. The tale had been a day's talk, a day's\npity--then forgotten.\n\nAgatha stood in the midst of all, but saw nothing. Nothing but the grey,\nbleak, merciless sea, howling and dancing to her feet like a victorious\nenemy, or sweeping off into the silence of the wintry horizon, there\ngrimly folding up its mystery, as if to say, \"Of me thou shalt know\nnothing.\" But Agatha felt as if, to win that secret, she was ready to\npierce into nethermost hell.\n\n\"Quick, let us go,\" she said, and almost bounded into the little vessel.\nShe stood on the deck, trembling with excitement, watched the paddles\ncrash into obedience the cruel waves, ride over them, on--on--to the\nmouth of the bay. And now for the first time she was out on the open\nsea.\n\nIt was one of those gloomy winter days when the whole ocean looks\nsullen--heavy with brooding storms. No blue foamy sweeps, no lovely\nsea-green calms; nothing but leaden-coloured hills of water, swelling\nand sinking, with black valleys between. Agatha remembered a story she\nhad read or heard in her childish days, of some wrecked sailor lad,\ndoomed to death by his mates because the boat was too full for safety,\nwho asked leave to sit on the gunwale until after the curl of the wave,\nand then quietly dropped off into the smooth hollow below.\n\nIt was horrible! She could not look at the sea--it made her mad. She\ncould only look skywards, and try to find a break in the dun clouds; or\nelse over to the horizon, to see something--ever so faint and small a\nsomething--breaking the line of water and sky.\n\nThe men on board apparently knew Mr. Dugdale, and he them. They worked\nwith a respectful solemnity, as if aware of their sad errand. The boat\nwas a little steam-tug, and she cut her way over the heavy seas like\na bird. Two men, and Marmaduke, kept watch constantly with the glass,\nshorewards and seawards. Sometimes they went so far out that the hazy\ncoast-line almost vanished, and then again they ran in-shore under the\ngigantic cliffs that lock the south of England coast.\n\nHour after hour, the poor wife remained on deck, sometimes walking about\nrestlessly, sometimes lying wrapped in sails and rugs, her face turned\nseaward in a dumb hopelessness that was more piteous than any moans. The\nseamen, if they happened to come near, looked at her with a sort of awe,\nmingled with that compassionate gentleness which sailors almost always\nshow towards women. More than once, great rough hands brought her\nfood, or put to use half-a-dozen clever nautical contrivances for the\nsheltering of \"the poor lady.\"\n\nLate at night she went down below; by daybreak she was on deck again.\nShe found Mr. Dugdale in his old place by the compass and the telescope.\nHe had slept by snatches where he sat, never giving up his watch for a\nsingle hour.\n\n\"E--h!\" he said, when she came and touched him. \"I was dreaming of the\nMissus and the little ones at home!\"\n\n\"Do you want to go home?\"\n\n\"No--no!--not while there's a hope. Keep heart, my child!\"\n\nBut they looked at each other's faces in the dawn, and saw how pale and\ndisconsolate both were. And still the little lonely boat kept rocking\nover the sea--the pitiless sea, that returned neither answer nor sign.\n\nAnother day--another night: just the same. Once or twice they came on\nthe track of some vessel; a ship outward or homeward bound, and told\ntheir story; shouting it out, in brief business-like words--how horrible\nthey sounded! And the ship's people would be seen to come to her side,\nstand a while looking at the melancholy little steamer on its\nhopeless search--then pass on. All the world seemed passing on slowly,\nslowly--leaving them to that blank sea and sky, and to their own\ndespair.\n\nOn the evening of the third day, Marmaduke, who had kept aloof for\nseveral hours, came and stood by his sister-in-law. She was leaning at\nthe stern, looking shorewards at two columns of rock, which the watery\nwear of ages had parted from the cliffs, leaving them set upright in\nthe sea, a little distance from one another, with the breakers boiling\nbetween.\n\n\"There's 'Old Harry and his wife,' as the Dorset people call them. We\nare near home now, Agatha.\"\n\n\"Home!\" She gasped the word in an agony, and turned her face again\nseawards--towards the grey desolate line where the Channel melted away.\n\n\"The steamer can't run on much longer without putting in-shore,\" said\nDuke, after an interval.\n\nAgatha almost shrieked; \"You are not going to land? We have been out\nsuch a little--little while! And you said yourself the boats would live\na long time in the open Channel.\"\n\n\"But that was three days ago.\"\n\n\"Three days--oh, Heaven!--three days.\"\n\nAnd the black, black cloud fell over her; the near vision of an\nexistence wherein _he_ was not--the going home a widow--or worse,\nbecause she could never have the certainty of widowhood. To be\nincessantly watching by day, and starting up at night, with the thought\nthat he was come! Never to know when, where, or in what manner he died;\nto have no last blessing--no last kiss! At the moment, Agatha would have\ngiven her whole future life--nay, her immortal soul--to cling for one\nminute round her husband's neck and tell him how she loved him--with\nthe one perfect love which nothing now could ever alter, weaken, or\nestrange.\n\nMr. Dugdale moved aside. He knew that for this burst of anguish there\nwas no consolation. After a time, he came and said those few soothing\nwords which are all that people can say, without being those \"miserable\ncomforters\" who only torture the more.\n\nEven then, in that last moment of anguish, there was power in the good\nand soothing influence so peculiar to Marmaduke Dugdale. Agatha grew\ncalmer--at least more passive. Soon, she saw that the little steamer's\nhead was turned to the shore. A convulsion passed over her, but she did\nnot rebel.\n\n\"There is a faint hope even yet,\" said Duke, with a melancholy voice\nthat almost gave the lie to his words. \"They may have drifted safe\nashore somewhere--though it would be almost a miracle. Or they may have\nbeen carried far out to sea, and been picked up by some outward-bound\nship. It's just a chance--but\"--\n\nAgatha understood that \"but\" Nothing but strong conviction would have\nforced it from her brother-in-law's lips. Her last hope died.\n\nAn hour or two more they spent in gliding up the narrow channel of that\nsalt-water swamp, which at high tide appeared so glittering from the\nThornhurst road. When approached, it was a muddy chaos, desolate as an\nuninhabited world.\n\nThey went as far up-stream as the little steamer could run, and then\nlanded on the bank which abutted on some rushy meadows. It was a dark\nwinter's night--there was not a soul abroad, though some faint light\nshowed they were near the town. The bells of Kingcombe Church were\nringing merrily through the mist.\n\n\"I had quite forgotten,\" muttered Duke to himself. \"This must be\nChristmas-eve.\"\n\nWhat a Christmas-eve!\n\nHe half led, half lifted Agatha through the wet fields and along the\nroad.\n\n\"You will go to my house, and let the Missus and me take care of you, my\nchild?\"\n\n\"No, no; I will go home!\"\n\nSo, without any further argument, he took her to her own gate. There\nit was, the familiar gate, with its shiny evergreens glittering in the\nlamp-light; beyond it, the dusky line of Kingcombe Street.. The cottage\nwithin was all dark, except for the faintest ray creeping under the\nhall-door. Marmaduke opened it, and called Dorcas. She came, and when\nshe saw them, rushed forward sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, missus, missus--is it my missus?\"\n\nIt was indeed the sorrowful mistress, who stood like a spectre in her\ndesolate home. But Dorcas dragged her in, and opened the parlour-door.\n\nThere was an odour of warmth--bright light, which so dazzled Agatha that\nat first she saw nothing. Then she saw some one lying on the sofa.\nAnd lo! there--half-buried in pillows, haggard and death-like, yet\nalive--was a face she knew--a calm, sleeping face--falling round it the\nlong light hair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nIt was Christmas morning. All the good people of Kingcombe were going\nto church. One only household did not go to church--there was hardly\nneed, when all their life henceforward would be one long grateful psalm.\n\nAgatha came down much as she had done on her first Sunday morning in\nthe same house, and made breakfast in the little parlour. There was a\nstrange hush about her--a joy too solemn for outward expression. When\nshe had finished all her preparations, she stood by the window, looking\non the sunny little garden, and listening to the Christ-mas-bells. The\ntears sprang faster--faster--her lips moved. What she was uttering no\near heard--save One. Whatever the good Kingcombe people thought, He\nto whom the whole earth is a temple, and all time a long Sabbath of\npraise--would forgive her that she did not go to church that day.\n\nShe heard a foot on the stairs, and ran thither like lightning.\n\nNathanael appeared. He was extremely feeble--every motion seemed to give\nhim pain;--and his whole appearance was that of one rescued from the\nvery jaws of the grave. But he looked so happy--so infinitely happy!\n\nAgatha half-scolded him. \"Why did you not call me? Why not let me help\nyou to walk? I can do it, I know.\" And creeping under his arm, she tried\nto convert her little self into a marvellously strong support.\n\nHer husband only smiled, allowing himself to be led to the sofa, laid\ndown, and made comfortable with countless pillows. Then she stood and\nlooked at him.\n\n\"Are you content?\"\n\n\"Quite content,\" he murmured. \"So content, that I want nothing in this\nwide world.\"\n\nAnd by his look his wife knew that this was true.\n\n\"Agatha, darling, you have been crying? Come and sit here.\"\n\nShe came--making a minute's pretence of smiles, and then fell on his\nneck, weeping,\n\n\"Oh! I don't deserve to be so happy--so very happy!\"\n\n\"Child,\" he answered, with a grave tenderness, \"if we went by desert,\nwho among us would deserve anything? Should I, who was so hard and cold\ntowards my poor little wife, when, if I had said one word out of my real\nheart, and not kept it down so proudly--Ah! I was very wicked. I, too,\ndid not deserve that God should save me from death, and bring me home to\nmy dear wife's love. Darling! don't let us talk of deservings; only let\nus try to be good, and always, always love one another.\"\n\nOh, the heavenly silence of that embrace, the life of life, that was in\nit! Now for the first time the bond of full and perfect love was drawn\nround the husband and wife, sacredly shutting them in from the world\nwithout, which could never more come between them, or intermeddle with\ntheir sorrows or their joys.\n\nAt length Agatha freed herself gently from his clasp, saying, after\nher old habit of hiding emotion under a jest, something about the\nimpossibility that the mistress of a household could idle away her time\nin this way. She made her husband's breakfast, and insisted on watching\nhim finish it.\n\nDrinking, he said with a shudder, \"Oh, Agatha, you don't know what it is\nto be thirsty! The hunger was nothing to it.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of that, don't,\" murmured she, turning pale.\n\n\"I will not, dear. But was it not strange that we should have drifted\nashore at Weymouth?\"\n\n\"Very strange.\"\n\n\"Have you sent over the way this morning, to see after Uncle Brian?\"\n\n\"Not yet; but Harrie will take care of him. He is not near so much hurt\nas you, and I must look after my own husband first.\" And once again\nwistfully gazing at him, she threw her arms round his neck, murmuring,\n\"My own--my own!\"\n\nThe church-bells ceased, the breakfast was removed, and the husband and\nwife sat together.\n\n\"Somebody,\" said Nathanael, suddenly--\"somebody ought to go and see\nAnne Valery this Christmas-day.\n\n\"Does she know?\"\n\n\"She knew last night. Marmaduke said he should ride over and tell her.\"\n\n\"What news for her to hear--dear, dear Anne!\"\n\nAnd they fell into a silence.\n\nAgatha said at last, \"When am I to see Uncle Brian?\"\n\n\"Very soon, dear. Yet--stay--is not that some one at the door?\"\n\nIt certainly was. People walked into one another's houses so very\nunceremoniously at Kingcombe. This visitor, however, paused in the hall,\nand then opened the parlour-door.\n\nHe was a remarkably tall man, with grey hair, and features not unlike\nNathanael's, being regular and delicate. But their expression was much\nharsher, and indicative of a strong will and a settled bitterness, which\nonly passed over when he smiled. This smile was very beautiful, and\nseemed to steal from his worn and hard-lined aspect at least ten years.\nAgatha knew who he was immediately.\n\n\"Uncle Brian!\" Nathanael sprang up, despite his weakness, and they\ngrasped one another's hands as heartily as if they had not met for\nyears.\n\n\"Is this your wife?\"\n\n\"It is indeed; my own dear wife.\"\n\n\"God bless her.\" Mr. Locke Harper took Agatha by the hand, and looked at\nher keenly. The peculiar expression either of bitterness or melancholy\ncame over his face, but as he watched her it gradually faded off. There\nseemed an enchantment in the young wife's sweet looks.\n\n\"You two are very happy?\"\n\nThey exchanged a glance, which needed no words of confirmation; but\nAgatha said, with a shy blush, and a womanly grace that made her\nsweeter-looking than ever.\n\n\"We are all the happier now Uncle Brian has come home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear. Thank your husband too, for me. I would have been\nlying 'full fathom five' in the Channel now, if it were not for that\nboy.\"\n\n\"That boy\" sounded oddly enough, save for the world of tenderness in the\nphrase, and the look which accompanied it. Any one could see at once the\nstrong attachment subsisting between the uncle and nephew. No more was\nbetrayed, however, and they soon began a conversation as natural and\nunconcerned as if they had gone through no peril, and suffered no\nemotion. Certainly, however strong their feelings, the Harpers were not\na \"sentimental\" family.\n\nAgatha thought, as like a dutiful wife she sat still and listened, that\nshe had never seen any man--saving her husband of course--whose mien was\nso simple, yet so truly noble, as Brian Locke Harper's. She watched him\nwith a pathetic curiosity, thinking what he must have been as a young\nman, with many other thoughts besides, which came from the very depths\nof her woman's heart.\n\nUncle Brian talked, though in a rather fragmentary and brief fashion, of\nKingcombe and of the changes he found. He never by any chance mentioned\nany other place than Kingcombe, until Nathanael happened to ask him\nwhere Duke was this morning?\n\n\"He has ridden out.\"\n\n\"But I wanted to see him, and thank him for being so kind to my poor\nlittle wife. Where has he gone?\"\n\n\"To Thornhurst.\" The word came out sharp, low, yet with a certain\ntone that made it unlike other words. After saying it, Uncle Brian sat\nmoodily looking at the fire from under his eyebrows, until Agatha, with\nwomanly wisdom, broke the silence, by speaking to her husband.\n\n\"I think some time this afternoon I ought to go and see Anne Valery.\"\n\n\"You shall go, dear.\"\n\nUncle Brian observed, never moving his eyes from the fire, \"Harriet said\nthat she--Miss Valery--was not quite strong this winter. Was that true?\"\n\nAgatha answered, \"That it was only too true.\"\n\nSomething in her manner seemed to startle Mr. Locke Harper; he threw\ntowards her one of his flashing, penetrating looks.\n\n\"We have indeed been very anxious about poor Anne,\" she answered. \"But\nwinter is a trying season, and we hope, in the spring\"--\n\n\"Yes, in the spring,\" repeated Uncle Brian, hastily. \"What a gay garden\nyou have for Christmas.\" He opened the glass door, and immediately\nwent out. They saw him walking about, backwards and forwards, among\nchrysanthemum beds and arbutus-trees, passing hurriedly, and with a\nbent-down, abstracted gaze, which beheld nothing.\n\n\"Does he know about her?\" said Agatha to her husband. \"You said you\nwould tell him.\"\n\n\"I could not, his mood was too bitter. And there are some things in\nwhich not even I dare break upon the reserve of Uncle Brian. He is as\nsecret and as proud--as I am.\"\n\n\"Ah, but\"--\n\n\"I understand that 'but' my child. I know how much both he and I have\noften erred.\"\n\nHis wife pressed his hand fondly, to indicate how love had sealed its\nkiss of forgiveness upon all things. Nathanael smiled, and continued:\n\n\"I found Uncle Brian in such a strange mood at Havre. I dared not speak\nof anything just then, but thought the fit time would be when we came\nnear the Dorset coast, and his heart was softened at the sight of home.\nI was walking on deck, pondering how to tell him, when the fire began.\"\n\n\"Ah, don't.\" And Agatha forgot everything--it was natural she should--in\nrejoicing once more over the beloved saved. Suddenly, there was heard\na fluttering, and a chattering with Dorcas in the hall, marking an\nunmistakable approach--Mrs. Dugdale with her young flock.\n\nHarrie was in the best of spirits and heartiest of moods, though that\nmay be an unnecessary superlative regarding a lady who had never been\nseen either moody or out of spirits since her cradle. She embraced\nAgatha warmly, and even went through the same ceremony with her brother\nNathanael, which he bore with exemplary fortitude, but shook his hair\nafter it, like a boy who has been petted against his will. However, he\nkissed his little nephews good-humouredly, let Brian sit astride on\nhis sofa-pillows, benignly assured Fred's inquiring mind that Uncle\nNathanael had not been to the bottom of the sea and up again--and\nanswered Gus with a more serious voice, that it was not exactly \"funny\"\nto be drowned.\n\n\"Funny? No, indeed,\" exclaimed the mother. \"I am sure the shock was\ndreadful to us all. I don't know when _I_ shall get over it And that\nreminds me that Duke thinks it had been too much for poor Anne. She is\nworse,--keeping her bed. I don't understand sick people much, but if\nAgatha could go--Oh, there you are, Uncle Brian! Duke sent a message to\nyou. He says, he is afraid it will be some days before you can see your\nold friend Anne: she is very ill indeed.\"\n\nBrian stood silent, resting his hand on the glass-door. The colourless\nface, void of any expression, excepting the eyes, and they--never, while\nshe lived, did Agatha forget the look of those eyes! She whispered,\npassing him by,\n\n\"I am going to her now--I shall send word soon;\" and left the room.\n\nThere was a slight difficulty about her being driven to Thornhurst, as\nshe insisted on her husband's keeping quiet at home. Harrie made a\ndozen plans and counter-plans, until they were all frustrated by Brian\nHarper's rising from the corner, where he had sat motionless.\n\n\"If you will allow me, I will drive you there.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" There was no more said about it; they started.\n\nMr. Locke Harper scarcely spoke to his niece all the way, until just\nas they were passing the gate where, on that awful walk, Agatha had\nstartled Mrs. Dugdale.\n\n\"I hear you came all these miles on foot, in the middle of the night. It\nwas a very brave thing for a woman to do. I did not think any woman\ncould have love enough in her to do it.\"\n\n\"I know several who would do much more.\"\n\n\"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Harrie Dugdale, probably; and for certain, Anne Valery.\"\n\nBrian said no more until they reached the gates of Thornhurst. There\nhe helped her to descend, reins in hand, and waited. Just as Agatha was\ngoing he touched her arm:\n\n\"Ask how she is, will you?\"\n\nAgatha sent the message up-stairs, and remained with him for a minute\nor two. He stood motionless by the horse, his hat pulled down over his\nbrows--nothing visible but the sharp profile of his mouth. Old Andrews\ncalled him \"that gentleman\"--eyed him with some curiosity, then bowed,\nand wished him a \"merry Christmas, sir,\" country fashion.\n\nThe answer about the mistress of Thornhurst was brief; she was \"much the\nsame;\" the servants did not seem to apprehend any danger.\n\nBrian shook his niece's hand. \"I shall go back across the moors to\nKingcombe. Tell her, if, at any time, she would like to see an old\nfriend\"--\n\nHe stopped, threw down Dunce's reins, and started off towards the high\nground, striding over heather and furze, with his free backwoodsman's\nstep.\n\nAndrews looked after him. \"If that be any man alive it be Mr. Locke\nHarper! O Lord! and I didn't know 'un--my dear old master! Mr. Harper!\nSir! Mr. Locke Harper.\" He ran a little way in vain pursuit of the\nretreating figure; then Agatha saw him sit down on a stone, hide his\nface in his shaking old hands, and cry for joy.\n\nWhile, far over the hill-side, in very sight of the closed blinds of\nAnne's room, the returned wanderer strode away, and disappeared.\n\nIt was some time before Agatha could summon courage to walk up-stairs.\nAll things seemed so strange. She could hardly realise the fact that she\nhad been driven from Kingcombe by Uncle Brian's own self, and that she\nwas now going to tell Anne Valery that he was here.\n\nAt last, calmed by faith in heaven, and in that next holiest faith,\nlove, she opened the door of Anne's bedroom.\n\nIt was silent, solemn, and peaceful. There was a prayer-book by the\nbedside, open at one of the Christmas-day psalms. No one lingered in the\nroom, or about the couch, with sisterly or friendly care; all was serene\nbut lonely, as Anne's whole life had been. At the opening of the door, a\nfaint voice asked, \"Who is there?\"\n\n\"Only I! Oh, Anne, dearest Anne!\"\n\nThere was a pause of weeping silence, though one only wept. Miss Valery\nsoothed the girl in all sorts of tender ways.\n\n\"You have suffered much, my poor child, but it is over now. Forget it.\nYou will be very happy now.\"\n\n\"And you too--you too, Anne! But why do you lie here so drearily, with\nno one near you?\"\n\n\"I like it.\"\n\n\"But you will rise soon? You must get well now they are come home. You\nlittle think how anxious all are about you.\"\n\n\"That is kind. Everybody was always very kind to me.\"\n\nAfter a few moments, during which Anne lay with her eyes shut, and\nAgatha watched, with an unaccountable dread, the wonderful, spiritual\ncalm of her features, she suddenly said:\n\n\"You have seen him, have you not?\"\n\n\"Uncle Brian? Yes.\"\n\n\"How does he look? Was he harmed by that--that awful three days at sea?\n\n\"No; he seems quite well. He drove me to Thornhurst.\"\n\n\"Then he is here?\" And there came a slight trembling over the placid\nface.\n\n\"He had to go back to Kingcombe, I believe,\" said Agatha, hesitating.\n\"But he told me to say, if you liked to see an old friend--He does not\nknow how ill you have been,\" she added, with irrepressible vexation, \"or\nelse I should have felt very, very angry, even with Uncle Brian.\"\n\n\"Hush! You do not understand him yet,\" said Anne, gently, as she once\nmore closed her eyes. Many thoughts seemed to sweep over her, but none\nleft a trace of bitterness behind. She was past all restlessness or\nsuffering now.\n\n\"How are you all going to keep Christmas, Agatha? You ought to be very\nhappy. After such a week as this has been, everything seems happiness\nnow.\"\n\n\"Not everything--when you are not with us, Anne--I mean, not with us\nto-day.\"\n\n\"But I shall be with you, to-day and every day. I believe I shall never\nbe far away from Thornhurst and Kingcombe, and Kingcombe Holm.\"\n\nShe said this more to herself than to Agatha, who listened, her throat\nchoking; then answered abruptly, \"You are talking too much--you must be\nquiet.\"\n\nAnne smiled--one of her old smiles, so full of cheerfulness. \"I think I\nam quiet enough already, but I will obey.\"\n\nShe turned her face to the pillow, and lay for a long time without\nmoving. At length she said:\n\n\"Agatha, I want you to do something for me.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I would like to see your husband, and my old friend, Mr. Brian Harper.\nWill you go and fetch them?\"\n\n\"I will to-morrow, but\"--\n\n\"No--dear, not to-morrow; I must see them to-day--this very\nChristmas-day. Go--you will not be away long. And we will send the\ncarriage, so that the journey can do Nathanael no harm.\"\n\n\"You are always thinking of every one,\" said Agatha, as she turned\nto obey. She felt it was a solemn mission. All her bright plans about\nThornhurst grew dim; she could not look forward. Yet, warm in the\nstrength of youth and love, she cherished a faint hope still.\n\nWhen she reached Kingcombe, Brian had not come home. They sent\nmessengers for him in all directions, but in vain. At last they were\nforced to drive back without him--hopelessly peering through the dusk\nto see if they could discern his tall figure across the moors. When they\nwere dashing at full speed through Thornhurst-gate, some one rose up\nfrom the hedge beside it, and stopped the horses.\n\n\"Is anything the matter at the house? Speak, can't you, fellow?\"\n\nThe voice hoarse and commanding--the tall, spare figure, the grey\nhair--it could be none other than Brian Harper.\n\nNathanael called to him. \"Uncle Brian, we have been looking for you\neverywhere. Anne wants to see you. Come.\"\n\n\"I will.\" He walked away and was lost in the furze-bushes; but when the\ncarriage drove up to the door they found him already standing there.\nThey all entered the house together.\n\nAnne's maid met them with a delighted countenance. Her mistress was so\nwell--thank God! She was up, and sitting in the drawing-room!\n\nThere in truth she was, in her usual seat, wearing her ordinary dress.\nShe had taken off the invalid-cap, and her soft hair was arranged as\ncarefully as if no white lines marred its brownness. She looked less\nold than usual--nay, almost beautiful--so exquisitely peaceful was the\nexpression of her countenance.\n\nNathanael and his wife hung back, letting Mr. Harper meet her first.\n\nShe rose and held out both hands to him. \"Welcome home again--welcome\nhome!\"\n\nHe said nothing, but grasped the hands, and retained them fast. There\nwas a long, long look, eye to eye, face to face,--a look, in which\nwere gathered and summed up all the years since they were young,\ntogether,--and then the two old friends sat down side by side. Agatha\nthought it strange that they should meet in such a calm, commonplace\nway--but then she was young. She did not know how quietly flows\nthe outward surface of a tide that has flowed on, deep, solemn, and\nchangeless, for five-and-twenty years.\n\nIn a little while they were all sitting round the fire--the merry\nChristmas fire with its blazing pine-log--talking just as naturally and\nfamiliarly as though no emotion had stirred them. Anne Valery, resting\nin her arm-chair, looked on and smiled. She talked little, but listened\nto the rest, and by an inexplicable sweet calmness, made them all so\nmuch at ease, that it seemed to Agatha as if they four had known one\nanother for a whole lifetime, and been always as happy as now.\n\nAs the evening advanced, the Christmas dinner was announced.\n\n\"I am sorry I cannot sit at the head of my own table to-day, but\"--and\nMiss Valery gently laid her hand on Brian's arm--\"you will take my\nplace, old friend?\"\n\nHe made some unintelligible answer, and they all left the drawing-room.\nIt was a rather silent dinner; yet, somehow, no one looked sad. No one\ncould, with Anne's cheerful influence pervading the whole house.\n\nAgatha soon rose and rejoined her. She was sitting just as they had left\nher--but whether it was through the light being dimmer, or through a\ncertain thoughtfulness in her face, Agatha thought she did not look\nquite the same.\n\n\"Are you well?\" Are you sure you are not tired? And\"--here Agatha\nventured to wrap her arms round her and gaze up in her eyes with a\nfulness of meaning--are you happy?\"\n\n\"Ay, happy! perfectly happy!\" The look and tone were such as Agatha\nnever forgot. They expressed a bliss that of its intensity could not\nnecessarily endure for more than the briefest time in this changing\nworld. It belonged to the world everlasting.\n\n\"Will you go back, dear, and ask Brian to come to me? I would like to\ntalk a little, alone, with my old friend.\"\n\nAgatha obeyed. When she had delivered her message, Mr. Locke Harper rose\nwithout speaking. She saw him go into the drawing-room and close the\ndoor; then she came back to her husband.\n\nFor more than two hours Agatha and Nathanael sat, not liking to go in\nwithout being summoned. At last they ventured to pass the door. The\nsilence within was so death-like that it half frightened them.\n\n\"I wish she would call,\" Agatha whispered. \"She looked so strangely\nwhite when she spoke to me. Hush! is not that some one stirring? I must\nknock.\"\n\nShe did so, but there was no answer. At last, trembling all over, she\ncaught hold of her husband's hand and made him enter.\n\nThe room was quite still--dimly-lighted--for the fire had been suffered\nto burn itself almost out. Anne sat in her arm-chair, with Brian\nkneeling beside her, his arms clasping her waist, and hers linked behind\nhis neck. Neither moved, or seemed to notice anything; and the two\nyoung people, greatly moved by the scene, were gliding away, when a last\nglimmer of the fire showed them Anne Valery's face. They saw it--grasped\none another's hands with an awe-struck meaning--and stayed.\n\nIn a minute or two Anne faintly spoke.\n\n\"I think there is some one near? Is it Agatha?\"\n\nThe young girl flung herself on Anne's hand.--\"It is I--and my husband.\nMay we stay? We, too, loved you, dear, dear Anne?\"\n\n\"I know that! One minute, just one minute, Brian.\"\n\nShe loosed her clasp of him a little; the other two came near, she\nkissed them both, and bade \"God bless them.\" Then raising herself up and\nspeaking with all her strength, she said,\n\n\"You will bear witness, and say to them all, that if I had married, none\nbut Brian Locke Harper would ever have been my husband: and therefore I\nhave left to him Thornhurst, and all I have in the world, in token of my\nlove and reverence--just as if--I had been--his wife.\"\n\nWith the last words, uttered very feebly, Anne sank back into her old\nattitude. She lay there many minutes, her face beautiful in its perfect\nrest. The other face--his face--was altogether hidden. But they saw\nthat, as his arms grasped her round, every muscle was quivering. The\nconvulsion grew so strong that even Anne felt it. She opened her eyes,\nand tried to speak again.\n\n\"Brian, poor Brian? Be content! it is not for long--not for very long.\"\n\nHer fingers began to flutter feebly on his neck. She fringed the grey\nlocks round them in a childish, absent way, muttering to herself.\n\n\"How very soft it feels still! He used to have such beautiful hair!\"\n\nThen, as if she felt her mind wandering, and strove to recall it, that\nto the very last moment it might rest on him, she again forcibly opened\nher eyes and fixed them on Brian's face. They never left it afterwards.\nThe whole world seemed to have faded from her except that face. For\na minute or two longer she lay looking at him, her countenance all\nradiant, until, gradually and softly, her eyes closed.\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered Nathanael, as he drew his weeping wife closer to his\nbosom, and pointed out the beatitude of that dying smile. \"Hush--she is\nquite happy. She has gone home!\"\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Agatha's Husband, by \nDinah Maria Craik (AKA: Dinah Maria Mulock)\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AGATHA'S HUSBAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 21767-8.txt or 21767-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/1\/7\/6\/21767\/\n\nDavid Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1194,"split":"test"}
