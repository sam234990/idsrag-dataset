At the age of twenty-two, having borrowed money from the executor of his grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s estate, he sailed to America. This was the first of more than a dozen Atlantic crossings, often made by working his passage aboard a cattle boat. Between 1893 and 1899 Davies travelled the highways and railroads, tutored by hardened men of the road. He took advantage of the corrupt system of \"boodle jails\" in order to pass the winter in Michigan, staying a series of different jails. These were jails in which a tramp could make an illicit arrangement with a law enforcement officer to stay in the jail without being an actual prisoner. Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of \"card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk.\" Regular work was never an option and Davies subsisted largely by begging. After crossing the Atlantic one last time, from Britain to Canada, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, Davies fell while hopping a train. His foot was crushed and his leg had to be amputated below the knee. He later wrote of the effect the accident had on his life: \"All the wildness had been taken out of me and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking.\"\nThe book was praised by Osbert Sitwell for its \"primitive splendour and directness\", while Bernard Shaw himself commended the prose to \"literary experts for its style alone\", describing Davies as \"the incorrigible Supertramp who wrote this amazing book.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp, by William H.

DAVIES\n\nPRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n\n\n\nPreface by Bernard Shaw\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nI hasten to protest at the outset that I have no personal knowledge of\nthe incorrigible Super-tramp who wrote this amazing book. If he is to\nbe encouraged and approved, then British morality is a mockery,\nBritish respectability an imposture, and British industry a vice.\nPerhaps they are: I have always kept an open mind on the subject; but\nstill one may ask some better ground for pitching them out of window\nthan the caprice of a tramp.\n\nI hope these expressions will not excite unreasonable expectations of\na thrilling realistic romance, or a scandalous chronicle, to follow.\nMr. Davies' autobiography is not a bit sensational: it might be the\nPost Office Directory for the matter of that. A less simple minded\nsupertramp would not have thought it worth writing at all; for it\nmentions nothing that might not have happened to any of us. As to\nscandal, I, though a most respectable author, have never written half\nso proper a book. These pudent pages are unstained with the frightful\nlanguage, the debased dialect, of the fictitious proletarians of Mr.\nRudyard Kipling and other genteel writers. In them the patrons of the\ncasual ward and the dosshouse argue with the decorum of Socrates, and\nnarrate in the style of Tacitus. They have that pleasant combination\nof childish freshness with scrupulous literary conscientiousness only\npossible to people for whom speech, spoken or written, but especially\nwritten, is still a feat to be admired and shewn off for its own sake.\nNot for the life of me could I capture that boyish charm and combine\nit with the _savoir vivre_ of an experienced man of the world, much\nless of an experienced tramp. The innocence of the author's manner and\nthe perfection of his delicacy is such, that you might read his book\naloud in an almshouse without shocking the squeamishness of old age.\nAs for the young, nothing shocks the young. The immorality of the\nmatter is stupendous; but it is purely an industrial immorality. As to\nthe sort of immorality that is most dreaded by schoolmistresses and\nduennas, there is not a word in the book to suggest that tramps know\neven what it means. On the contrary, I can quite believe that the\nauthor would die of shame if he were asked to write such books as Adam\nBede or David Copperfield.\n\nThe manuscript came into my hands under the following circumstances.\nIn the year 1905 I received by post a volume of poems by one William\nH. Davies, whose address was The Farm House, Kennington S. E. I was\nsurprised to learn that there was still a farmhouse left in\nKennington; for I did not then suspect that the Farmhouse, like the\nShepherdess Walks and Nightingale Lanes and Whetstone Parks of Bethnal\nGreen and Holborn, is so called nowadays in irony, and is, in fact, a\ndosshouse, or hostelry where single men can have a night's lodging\nfor, at most, sixpence.\n\nI was not surprised at getting the poems. I get a gift of minor poetry\nonce a week or so; and yet, hardened as I am to it, I still, knowing\nhow much these little books mean to their authors, can seldom throw\nthem aside without a twinge of compunction which I allay by a glance\nat one of the pages in the faint but inextinguishable hope of finding\nsomething valuable there. Sometimes a letter accompanies the book; and\nthen I get a rapid impression, from the handwriting and notepaper as\nwell as from the binding and type in the book, or even from the\nreputation of the publisher, of the class and type of the author. Thus\nI guess Cambridge or Oxford or Maida Vale or West Kensington or Exeter\nor the lakes or the east coast; or a Newdigate prizeman, a romantic\nJew, a maiden lady, a shy country parson or whom not, what not, where\nnot. When Mr. Davies' book came to hand my imagination failed me. I\ncould not place him. There were no author's compliments, no\npublisher's compliments, indeed no publisher in the ordinary channel\nof the trade in minor poetry. The author, as far as I could guess, had\nwalked into a printer's or stationer's shop; handed in his\nmanuscript; and ordered his book as he might have ordered a pair of\nboots. It was marked \"price half a crown.\" An accompanying letter\nasked me very civilly if I required a half-crown book of verses; and\nif so, would I please send the author the half crown: if not, would I\nreturn the book. This was attractively simple and sensible. Further,\nthe handwriting was remarkably delicate and individual: the sort of\nhandwriting one might expect from Shelley or George Meredith. I opened\nthe book, and was more puzzled than ever; for before I had read three\nlines I perceived that the author was a real poet. His work was not in\nthe least strenuous or modern: there was in it no sign that he had\never read anything later than Cowper or Crabbe, not even Byron,\nShelley or Keats, much less Morris, Swinburne, Tennyson, or Henley and\nKipling. There was indeed no sign of his ever having read anything\notherwise than as a child reads. The result was a freedom from\nliterary vulgarity which was like a draught of clear water in a\ndesert. Here, I saw, was a genuine innocent, writing odds and ends of\nverse about odds and ends of things, living quite out of the world in\nwhich such things are usually done, and knowing no better (or rather\nno worse) than to get his book made by the appropriate craftsman and\nhawk it round like any other ware.\n\nEvidently, then, a poor man. It horrified me to think of a poor man\nspending his savings in printing something that nobody buys: poetry,\nto wit. I thought of Browning threatening to leave the country when\nthe Surveyor of Taxes fantastically assessed him for an imaginary\nincome derived from his poems. I thought of Morris, who, even after\nThe Earthly Paradise, estimated his income as a poet at a hundred a\nyear. I saw that this man might well be simple enough to suppose that\nhe could go into the verse business and make a living at it as one\nmakes a living by auctioneering or shopkeeping. So instead of throwing\nthe book away as I have thrown so many, I wrote him a letter telling\nhim that he could not live by poetry. Also, I bought some spare\ncopies, and told him to send them to such critics and verse fanciers\nas he knew of, wondering whether they would recognise a poet when they\nmet one.\n\nAnd they actually did. I presently saw in a London newspaper an\nenthusiastic notice of the poems, and an account of an interview with\nthe author, from which I learnt that he was a tramp; that \"the farm\nhouse\" was a dosshouse; and that he was cut off from ordinary\nindustrial pursuits by two circumstances: first, that he had mislaid\none of his feet somewhere on his trampings, and now had to make shift\nas best he could with the other; second, that he was a man of\nindependent means--a _rentier_--in short, a gentleman.\n\nThe exact amount of his independent income was ten shillings a week.\nFinding this too much for his needs, he devoted twenty per cent of it\nto pensioning necessitous friends in his native place; saved a further\npercentage to print verses with; and lived modestly on the remainder.\nMy purchase of eight copies of the book enabled him, I gathered, to\ndiscard all economy for about three months. It also moved him to offer\nme the privilege (for such I quite sincerely deem it) of reading his\nautobiography in manuscript. The following pages will enable the world\nat large to read it in print.\n\nAll I have to say by way of recommendation of the book is that I have\nread it through from beginning to end, and would have read more of it\nhad there been any more to read. It is a placid narrative, unexciting\nin matter and unvarnished in manner, of the commonplaces of a tramp's\nlife. It is of a very curious quality. Were not the author an approved\npoet of remarkable sensibility and delicacy I should put down the\nextraordinary quietness of his narrative to a monstrous callousness.\nEven as it is, I ask myself with some indignation whether a man should\nlose a limb with no more to-do than a lobster loses a claw or a lizard\nhis tail, as if he could grow a new one at his next halting place! If\nsuch a thing happened to me, I should begin the chapter describing it\nwith \"I now come to the event which altered the whole course of my\nlife, and blighted, etc., etc.\" In Mr. Davies' pages the thing\nhappens as unexpectedly as it did in real life, and with an effect on\nthe reader as appalling as if he were an actual spectator. Fortunately\nit only happened once: half a dozen such shocks would make any book\nunbearable by a sensitive soul.\n\nI do not know whether I should describe our supertramp as a lucky man\nor an unlucky one. In making him a poet, Fortune gave him her\nsupremest gift; but such high gifts are hardly personal assets: they\nare often terrible destinies and crushing burdens. Also, he chanced\nupon an independent income: enough to give him reasonable courage, and\nnot enough to bring him under the hoof of suburban convention, lure\nhim into a premature marriage, or deliver him into the hands of the\ndoctors. Still, not quite enough to keep his teeth in proper repair\nand his feet dry in all weathers.\n\nSome flat bad luck he has had. I suppose every imaginative boy is a\ncriminal, stealing and destroying for the sake of being great in the\nsense in which greatness is presented to him in the romance of\nhistory. But very few get caught. Mr. Davies unfortunately was seized\nby the police; haled before the magistrate; and made to expiate by\nstripes the bygone crimes of myself and some millions of other\nrespectable citizens. That was hard luck, certainly. It gives me a\nfeeling of moral superiority to him; for I never fell into the hands\nof the police--at least they did not go on with the case (one of\nincendiarism), because the gentleman whose property I burnt had a\nstrong sense of humour and a kindly nature, and let me off when I made\nhim a precocious speech--the first I ever delivered--on the\nthoughtlessness of youth. It is remarkable what a difference it makes,\nthis matter of the police; though it is obviously quite beside the\nethical question. Mr. Davies tells us, with his inimitable quiet\nmodesty, that he begged, stole, and drank. Now I have begged and\nstolen; and if I never drank, that was only an application of the\nprinciple of division of labour to the Shaw clan; for several members\nof it drank enough for ten. But I have always managed to keep out of\nthe casual ward and the police court; and this gives me an ineffable\nsense of superior respectability when I read the deplorable\nconfessions of Mr. Davies, who is a true poet in his disregard for\nappearances, and is quite at home in tramp wards.\n\nAnother effect of this book on me is to make me realise what a slave\nof convention I have been all my life. When I think of the way I\nworked tamely for my living during all those years when Mr. Davies, a\nfree knight of the highway, lived like a pet bird on titbits, I feel\nthat I have been duped out of my natural liberty. Why had I not the\nluck, at the outset of my career, to meet that tramp who came to Mr.\nDavies, like Evangelist to Christian, on the first day of his American\npilgrim's progress, and saved him on the very brink of looking for a\njob, by bidding him to take no thought for the morrow; to ask and it\nshould be given to him; to knock and it should be opened to him; and\nto free himself from the middle class assumption that only through\ntaking a ticket can one take a train. Let every youth into whose hands\nthis book falls ponder its lesson well, and, when next his parents and\nguardians attempt to drive him into some inhuman imprisonment and\ndrudgery under the pretext that he should earn his own living, think\nof the hospitable countrysides of America, with their farm-houses\noverflowing with milk and honey for the tramp, and their offers of\nadoption for every day labourer with a dash of poetry in him.\n\nAnd then, how much did I know about hotels until I read this book! I\nhave often wondered how the poor travel; for it is plain that the\nRitzes and Metropoles, and even the hotels noted by Baedeker as\n\"unpretending,\" are not for them. Where does the man with sixpence in\nhis pocket stay? Mr. Davies knows. Read and learn.\n\nIt is to be noted that Mr. Davies is no propagandist of the illusions\nof the middle-class tramp fancier. You never suspect him of having\nread Lavengro, or got his notions of nomads from Mr. Theodore Watts\nDunton. He does not tell you that there is honour among tramps: on the\ncontrary, he makes it clear that only by being too destitute to be\nworth robbing and murdering can a tramp insure himself against being\nrobbed and murdered by his comrade of the road. The tramp is\nfastidious and accomplished, audacious and self-possessed; but he is\nfree from divine exploitation: he has no orbit: he has the endless\ntrouble of doing what he likes with himself, and the endless\ndiscountenance of being passed by as useless by the Life Force that\nfinds superselfish work for other men. That, I suppose, is why Mr.\nDavies tramps no more, but writes verses and saves money to print them\nout of eight shillings a week. And this, too, at a moment when the\nloss of a limb has placed within his reach such success in begging as\nhe had never before dared to dream of!\n\nMr. Davies is now a poet of established reputation. He no longer\nprints his verses and hawks them: he is regularly published and\nreviewed. Whether he finds the change a lucrative one I venture to\ndoubt. That the verses in The Soul's Destroyer and in his New Poems\nwill live is beyond question; but whether Mr. Davies can live if\nanything happens to his eight shillings a week (unless he takes to the\nroad again) is another matter. That is perhaps why he has advised\nhimself to write and print his autobiography, and try his luck with it\nas Man of Letters in a more general sense. Though it is only in verse\nthat he writes exquisitely, yet this book, which is printed as it was\nwritten, without any academic corrections from the point of view of\nthe Perfect Commercial Letter Writer, is worth reading by literary\nexperts for its style alone. And since his manner is so quiet, it has\nbeen thought well by his friends and his publishers to send a\ntrumpeter before him the more effectually to call attention to him\nbefore he begins. I have volunteered for that job for the sake of his\npoems. Having now done it after my well known manner, I retire and\nleave the stage to him.\n\n    G. B.

It was kept by my\ngrandfather, native of Cornwall, a retired sea captain, whose pride it\nwas, drunk or sober, to inform all strangers that he had been master\nof his own ship, the said ship being a small schooner. In those days\nthere was a steam packet, called the _Welsh Prince_, trading regularly\nbetween N----and Bristol, and in the latter town we had relatives on\nmy grandmother's side. The fact of the matter was that my grandmother\nbelonged to Somerset, and she often paid a visit to three maiden\nsisters, first cousins of hers, living, I believe, near Glastonbury,\nwho had a young relative that had gone on the stage, and was causing\nsome stir under a different name from his own, which was Brodrib. My\ngrandmother held very strong opinions about the stage, and when these\nfirst cousins met, no doubt the young man, in those early days, was\nmost severely discussed, and, had he not been a blood relation, would\nhave been considered a sinner too far advanced for prayer.\n\nMy earliest recollection is of being taken as a small boy with an\nelder brother to Bristol on the _Welsh Prince_ by my grandfather. I\nbelieve the frequency of these trips was mainly owing to the\nfriendship existing between the two captains, as my grandfather seldom\nleft the bridge, taking a practical part in the navigation of the ship\nand channel--except at times to visit the saloon cabin for a little\nrefreshment.\n\nOn one trip we had a very stormy passage, and on that occasion the\nwinds and the waves made such a fool of the _Welsh Prince_ that\nshe--to use the feminine gender, as is the custom of every true\nmariner, of one of whom I am a proud descendant--often threatened to\ndive into the bowels of the deep for peace. It was on this occasion\nthat my grandfather assisted the captain of the _Welsh Prince_ to such\npurpose that people aboard acclaimed him as the saviour of their\nlives, and blessed him for the safety of the ship. It is not therefore\nto be wondered at when the old man ashore, returning at midnight from\nthis rough voyage with me and my brother, would frequently pause and\nstartle the silent hour with a stentorian voice addressed to\nindifferent sleepers--\"Do you know who I am? Captain Davies, master\nof his own ship.\" Whether the police were awed by this announcement,\nor knew him to be an honest, respectable man with a few\nidiosyncrasies, I cannot say; but it was apparent to me in those young\ndays that they assisted him home with much gentleness, and he was\npassed on carefully from beat to beat, as though he were a case of new\nlaid eggs.\n\nAlas! the _Welsh Prince_ became childish in her old age. She would\noften loiter so long in the channel as to deceive the tide that\nexpected her, and to disappoint a hundred people who assembled on the\nbridge--under which she moored--to welcome her. What with her missing\nof tides, her wandering into strange courses, her sudden appearance in\nthe river after rumours of loss, her name soon became the common talk\nof the town. Her erratic behaviour became at last so usual that people\nlost all interest as to her whereabouts, or whither she had wandered,\nand were contented to know that she arrived safe, though late. They\nwere not curious to know if she had been dozing in a fog or had rested\nfor a day or two on a bank of mud; whatever she had done, she had been\ntoo wary to collide, and, being too slow to dash through the waves,\nhad allowed them to roll her over with very little power of\nresistance. These things happened until she was condemned and sold,\nand her mooring place to this day is unoccupied by a successor. When\nI now cross the bridge and look down on her accustomed place, I think\nwith tender emotion of the past. After the _Welsh Prince_ had been\ndeposed in her old age, accused of disobeying captain and crew,\ncharged with being indifferent to her duties, and forgetful of her\nresponsibilities--her captain, losing his beloved ship, idled a few\nmonths ashore and died. No doubt he had grown to love her, but she had\ngone beyond the control of living man, and a score of the best seamen\nbreathing could not have made her punctual to her duties; therefore he\ncould not reasonably answer the charges made against her. Some other\ncompany, it was rumoured, had chartered her for the Mediterranean,\nwhich would certainly be much better for her time of life; the\nMediterranean being so large a body of water as compared with the\nBristol Channel, would allow her more scope for manoeuvres. But all\nthis was idle talk, probably a profane sneer at her old age, for it\nwas told me by an eye-witness, that she was run ashore in an isolated\npool at the mouth of the river, stripped unceremoniously of her iron,\nand her wood-work burned. It is only a few years ago since the river\nwas hers, but her name is seldom mentioned at the present day.\n\nIt was through being born in a public house that I became acquainted\nwith the taste of drink at a very early age, receiving sups of mulled\nbeer at bed time, in lieu of cocoa or tea, as is the custom in more\ndomestic houses. So that, after my school days were over, I required\nbut very little inducement to drink.\n\nAt last the old people, being tired of business and having a little\nproperty, retired into private life; my father, whom I cannot\nremember, being dead, and my mother marrying the second time, much to\nthe old folks' annoyance. Their own children having all died, they\nkindly offered to adopt us three children, the only grandchildren they\nhad; and mother, knowing that such would be to our future benefit, at\nonce agreed. When we were settled in private life our home consisted\nof grandfather, grandmother, an imbecile brother, a sister, myself, a\nmaidservant, a dog, a cat, a parrot, a dove, and a canary bird. I\nremember those happy days, and often wish I could speak into the ears\nof the dead the gratitude which was due to them in life, and so ill\nreturned.\n\nMy school days began, but I played truant day after day, and the\nmaidservant had to lead me as a prisoner to school. Although small of\nfigure I was a good athlete, and so often fighting that some of my\nrelatives thought that prize fighting was of a certainty to be my\nfuture vocation. Mother's father and brothers all took great interest\nin pugilism, and they knew the game well from much practice of their\nown. They were never so much delighted as when I visited them with a\nblack eye or a bloody nose, at which time they would be at the trouble\nto give cunning points as to how to meet an opponent according to his\nweight and height. \"He certainly has the one thing essential,\" they\naffirm, one to the other, \"and that is the heart. Without that\nexperience would be of no account, but with that it will be the making\nof him.\" If I took off my coat to battle in the streets, the shirt\nitself came off in the lanes and fields. When attending school I would\naccompany a dozen or more boys \"following the leader.\" Needless to\nsay, I was the leader; and, being a good jumper, would leap over\nditches that would try every nerve in my body. Two or three would\nfollow a little less successfully, and then we would bully and\nthreaten the less active to make the attempt. Often we had to drag\nthem out by the hair of the head, and it was in this condition that\nthey were led back to school late--always late. The dirtiest boy, who\nhad had the most pressure put upon him, and was truly the most gentle\nand least guilty of us all--would be punished the most severely for\nthese escapades, owing to his dirtier condition; and most likely\nreceive more punishment afterwards at home. Strange that I was not a\nbad scholar, and that I passed all my standards with ease. In the last\nyear of my school days I became captain of the school's football team,\nand was honoured and trusted by being allowed to take charge of the\nball, but owing to making private use of the same, and practising in\nsecret with boys of other schools, I was requested by the Committee to\nforfeit my trust, although I might still continue captain as\naforesaid. If I had been contented with these innocent honours, and\nhad not been so ambitious to excel in other and more infamous parts,\nall would have been well, and my schooldays would have been something\nof a credit to me. But unfortunately, at this time, I organised a band\nof robbers, six in number, and all of good families and comfortable\nhomes. It was our wont to enter busy stores, knowing that small boys\nwould not be attended to until the grown people had finished their\npurchases. Then we would slyly take things up for a curious\nexamination, at the same time watching a favourable opportunity to\nsurreptitiously appropriate them. When accosted by the shopman as to\nour wants we would innocently ask the price of some article we had\nagreed on, and receiving answer, would quietly leave the premises.\nThis went on for some time, and I had nefariously profited by a large\nassortment of miscellaneous articles, such as paints, brushes, books,\nbottles of scent and various other items that could not be preserved,\nsuch as sweets and confectionery. How this continued for six weeks\nspeaks well for our well laid plans, and our dexterity in the\nperformance of them. My girl, Maggie, who had, during our early\nacquaintance, received only presents of wild flowers and birds' eggs,\nand occasionally a handful of nuts, was now the happy possessor of\nvaluable presents in the shape of purses, pocket books, bottles of\nscents, pencils of silver, not to mention having received a hundred\ndifferent sorts of sweets and cake that was superior to her mother's.\nTime after time she promised not to betray me; or any of my\nconfederates. The latter often warned me against reposing confidence\nin the other sex. One produced a book, at that very moment, which told\nhow a woman betrayed a gang of robbers; and it was his firm opinion\nthat the other sex could not be trusted farther than they could be\nseen.\n\nAt home I was cured of thieving by what I thought at that time to be a\nvery remarkable incident--no more or less than the result of\nwitchcraft. One day my grandmother happened to be standing before the\nfire cooking, and above the fireplace was a large mirror, towards\nwhich her eyes were turned. Thinking this a favourable opportunity to\nrifle the sugar basin, I lost no time in making the attempt; but my\nfingers had scarcely closed on a large lump when the old lady, without\nin the least turning her head, cried in a shrill voice, \"You dare!\"\nFor my life I could not account for this discovery, and it sent such a\nshock through me that I never again attempted in the old lady's\npresence to be other than honest. She could close her eyes in the arm\nchair and even breathe audibly, but I never had the confidence to\nmake another attempt. But this incident at home had no detrimental\neffect on my courage abroad.\n\nOne day I and my lieutenant played truant from school, and making our\nway up town, began to execute various little plans that had been\nconcocted the night before. After several desperate sorties on\nconfectionery, with our usual success, we began to meditate on higher\ngame. We blundered at a cigar case in a chemist shop, and had to leave\nour spoils behind. Although fearful, we entered a large grocery store,\nand were having great success, when my lieutenant dropped a bottle of\nscent, and not having the presence of mind to stand his ground and\nmake it appear an accident, made a guilty rush through the open door.\nI followed him at once, and catching him up, got clear ahead. But the\nhue and cry was out, and every one shouted, \"Stop thieves!\" This\nterrible cry, taken up by one and another, took all the strength out\nof our legs, and our own sheer terror brought us to a halt. In five\nminutes we were captured and crying over our ill luck in a prison\ncell. We made a confession of everything, and the rest of the gang\nwere soon under arrest. Our houses were visited by detectives and\nsearched, and different articles found in cupboards, drawers, desks,\nand chests which were soon identified by the shopkeepers. Maggie, at\nthe instigation of her mother, gave several articles to the police,\nwith information, proving to me, even in those early days, how little\nher sex was to be trusted. The unfortunate part of this was that we\nall had good homes. My grandfather would most certainly have paid a\nfine of twenty or thirty pounds to save me from punishment, and\noffered, I believe, to do the same. Alas! the magistrates were\ninexorable, and I and my lieutenant were sentenced each to twelve\nstrokes with the birch rod, whilst the other four, not being caught\nred-handed, received six strokes each. I do not at present feel much\nremorse for those desperate times, but often think of the disgrace to\nparents. The kindly admonishment of my schoolmaster made me shed the\nreal tears of repentance, not being forced from me by any thought of\npunishment. This ended my schooldays; and after the breaking up of our\ngang, I was not allowed much liberty, our elders being afraid of a\nreorganisation. When I was allowed out for an hour's play, strict\ninjunctions were given me not to leave our own door, and this was not\nmuch to my liking. In the dark winter evenings I would sit with my\ngrandfather, my brother and sister, painting ships or reading before a\nlarge fire that was never allowed to burn below its highest bar. My\ngrandfather, with his old habits, would pace slowly up and down the\nhalf dark passage, shutting himself out in the cold. Every now and\nthen he would open the front door to look at the stars or to inform\nhimself from what latitude the wind blew. The wind never changed\nwithout his knowledge; for this wary mariner invariably surprised it\nin the act of doing so. Three or four times in the evening he would\nopen the kitchen door to see that his family were comfortable, as\nthough he had just made his way from the hurricane deck to enquire\nafter the welfare of passengers in the cabin. When this was done, the\nold lady would sometimes say, rather peevishly, \"Francis, do sit down\nfor a minute or two.\" Then he would answer gruffly, but not\nunkindly--\"Avast there, Lydia,\" closing the door to begin again his\nsteady pacing to and fro.\n\nAt this time I had a boy companion, named Dave, who was a great\nreader, had enough self-confidence to recite in public, and was a\nwonderful raconteur of tales. Great things were expected of him in\nafter years. I have heard since that intemperance prevented their\nfulfilment, but we were too innocent in those days to think that such\nwould be the case. Through him I became a reader, in the first place\nwith an idea of emulating his cleverness, which led to a love of\nliterature for its own self. Of course I began with the common penny\nnovel of the worst type, but acquired a taste for better work in a\nshorter time than boys usually do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nYOUTH\n\n\nLife was very irksome to me at this period, being led to chapel\nmorning and evening on Sundays, and led back; having the mortification\nof seeing other boys of the same age enjoying their liberty. The only\nway to alter these conditions was to apply for work. This was soon\ndone, hiring myself out to an ironmonger, at a weekly wage of five\nshillings. The old people now began to take a pride in me, advising me\nto study my master's interests, and without doubt succeed to his\nbusiness at his decease. My brother, two years my senior, who, as I\nhave said before, was odd in his behaviour, took example by me, and\nsucceeded in being employed at a large clothing establishment. It was\nthere and then that he began and finished his life's work in half a\nday. Having been sent to the dock with a large parcel valued at two\npounds ten shillings, he found on arrival that the _Betsy Jane_ was\nmoored in the middle of the dock. My brother, seeing this, and not\nbeing blessed with inventive faculties, placed the parcel on the quay\nand returned to his master. Naturally the shopkeeper thought it was\nsafely delivered, until the captain of the _Betsy Jane_, coming\nstraight from his ship, entered the shop to make enquiries about his\ngoods. My brother, having a clear conscience, explained matters in his\nsimple way to the open eyed astonishment of his hearers. The result\nwas a summary dismissal, and a letter to my grandfather requesting him\nto make good the loss of the parcel; which was duly done, my\ngrandfather being extremely afraid of the law. The old people would\nnever admit that my brother was different from other boys, although it\nwas apparent not only to grown folk, but to the smallest child in the\nstreet. Some days before the affair just mentioned my grandmother,\nhaving to answer the door, ordered my brother to watch some fish,\nwhich was being prepared for dinner. When she returned, the cat was\nenjoying a good meal under the sofa. To the old lady's cry of\n\"Francis, did I not tell you to watch the fish,\" my brother answered\ntruthfully: for he always told the truth and did what he was told--\"So\nI did, grandmother, and the cat took it.\" If she had explained to him\nproperly why she wanted the fish watched, at the same time making\nspecial mention of a cat's partiality for fish, no doubt he would have\nwatched to better purpose.\n\nNothing could have happened better than this instance of the loss of\nthe ship's goods to undeceive my grandfather as to my brother's state\nof mind. A sudden blaze of intelligence broke in on the old man's\nmind, which was not of the most brilliant kind. \"Lydia,\" said he to\nhis wife, \"there's something wrong with the boy; to think he did not\nhave sense enough to shout, Ship ahoy.\" I ventured to say, to show my\ncleverness, that there might have been several ships in the middle of\nthe dock, and they would have all answered to Ship ahoy. Would it not\nhave been better to cry, _Betsy Jane_, ahoy? The old man paused\nthunderstruck. \"Avast there,\" he cried, \"drop anchor: will ye have\nmore pudding?\"\n\nIn our street almost every woman had some one connected with the sea,\nand it was my grandfather's pleasure by day to parade the street and\ninform the women as to what winds and tides were favourable to their\nhusbands or sons. One woman had a husband that had sailed away in a\nbarque, which was never sighted or hailed after leaving port, and was\nnow three months overdue. My grandfather feared to meet this sailor's\nwife, and would often peep around his door, trying to escape\nconsultation from her, knowing well his own forebodings as to the fate\nof the barque and her crew.\n\nI have mentioned Dave, who was a very studious lad, and who became my\none companion and the sharer of my dreams. He had received an old copy\nof Byron, and we both became fascinated by the personality of that\npoet. His influence on Dave was so great that it was publicly shown\nto all the boys and girls in the chapel's schoolroom, where we had\ngathered for childish games, under the supervision of the elders.\nWhile we were playing kiss in the ring, singing and laughing, dancing\nwith merriment, when small white teeth, red lips and bright eyes were\nall the rage--Dave would lean his figure (not so tall as he would like\nit) against a pillar, biting his lips and frowning at our\nmerry-making. None but myself knew that his troubles and sorrows were\npurely imaginary, but they certainly succeeded in causing some\nsensation, even the notice of the elders being drawn to him. Some time\nafter this we had more trouble with Dave, when we went for a day's\ntrip to the sea-side. On this occasion he took his own path across the\nsands, a solitary figure, with his head bowed, and when we called him\nhe would not heed us. That night, when it was time to return Dave\nstood perilously near the edge of the pier, gazing with melancholy\neyes on the water. Several women hastened towards him, and drawing him\ngently away, enquired as to his trouble. On which Dave stood erect,\nwas motionless, frowned, bit his lip, and stalked away into the\ndarkness, without uttering a word. He came back in time to catch the\nboat. Dave soon got tired of these doings, but the influence of Byron\nwas more lasting on me. It was the first time for me to read verse\nwith enjoyment. I read Shelley, Marlowe, and Shakespeare, indifferent\nto Wordsworth, but giving him since the attention of wiser days.\n\nMy grandmother had only read one novel in her life, called \"The\nChildren of the Abbey,\" and had been severely punished by her mother\nfor doing so. She therefore continually warned me against reading such\nworks, but strongly recommended Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and Young's\n\"Night Thoughts\"; her favourite quotation being from the\nlatter--\"Procrastination is the thief of time.\" It pleased her to\ntears when a friend saw a likeness between John Bunyan and myself, and\nshe regretted that she saw no prospect of ever tracing a resemblance\nbetween our hearts.\n\nI was now bound apprentice to the picture frame trade, but owing to my\npassion for reading, could not apply myself sufficiently to that\nbusiness so as to become a good workman. The fact of the matter was\nthat I was reading deep into the night and, having to be up early for\nwork, was encroaching on Nature's allowance of sleep. Owing to being\nyoung and conceited and not being satisfied at having knowledge\nconcealed, I showed at this time some parts that made older and wiser\npeople of both sexes prophesy good results in manhood. Having no\nknowledge of metre and very little of harmony, I composed and caused\nto be printed a poem describing a storm at night, which a young friend\nrecited at a mutual improvement class, making after mention of the\nauthor's name, when I was publicly congratulated. Some time after this\nI--having surreptitiously visited the playhouse on more than one\noccasion--boldly read out an article to the same class entitled--\"In\ndefence of the Stage.\" This daring performance caused some commotion\namong the full grown sheep, who thought they detected a wolf in lamb's\nclothing; but the young lamb--my companions--bleated for pride and\njoy. My grandmother was told of this, and as she did not take the\ntrouble to enquire the subject of my address, and it was not told unto\nher, she was satisfied to know I had surprised several members of the\ncongregation and in particular a deacon, for whom she had great\nrespect.\n\nIt has always been a wonder to me where my conversational power has\ngone: at the present time I cannot impress the most ordinary men. It\nmust be through associating so many years with companions uncongenial\nto my taste, a preference for indulging in my own thoughts, and\nforcing myself to comment on subjects uninteresting to me. I remember\nat one time being in a lodging house where one man stood out as an\nauthority on books, disease, politics, military tactics, and more\nespecially the meaning and right pronunciation of words. Several times\ndifferent men have said to me, \"That man is a scholar; he is not an\nignoramus, as the likes of you and me.\" It was a secret satisfaction\nto know that this gentleman to whom they referred, often paid the\ncompliment of knowing more than himself by asking information, which,\non my part, was imparted with much secrecy, as I did not wish to\nappear in any way superior to those with whom I was forced by\ncircumstances to associate. Yet, in those happy days of my\napprenticeship, I rarely visited a house but what a second invitation\nwas assured, although a painful shyness marred the beginning. We\nenjoyed ourselves so much one evening at a friend's house, where the\nlady had been all day indisposed, that her husband said, on leaving,\n\"My wife has been laughed out of her sickness, and you have certainly\nsaved me an item on the doctor's bill.\" Instead of this giving more\nconfidence and overcoming my shyness, when I received from them an\ninvitation for a second party I became so overpowered at the thought\nof what would be expected of me, that for the life of me I could not\naccept it, knowing I would have made an ass of myself. It is not\naltogether shyness that now makes me unsuccessful in company.\nSometimes it is a state of mind that is three parts meditation that\nwill not free the thoughts until their attendant trains are prepared\nto follow them. Again, having heard so much slang my thoughts often\nclothe themselves in that stuff from their first nakedness. That being\nthe case, shame and confusion in good company make me take so long to\nundress and clothe them better, in more seemly garments, that other\npeople grow tired of waiting and take upon themselves the honour of\nentertainers. It was in the second year of my apprenticeship that I\nmet a young woman living in a small village adjoining this town of my\nbirth, who was very clever, a great reader of fine literature; and it\nwas to her hands, after I had enjoyed her conversation on several\noccasions, that I submitted a small composition of my own. Her\nencouragement at that early time has been the star on which these eyes\nhave seldom closed, by which I have successfully navigated the deeps\nof misery, pushing aside Drink, my first officer, who many a day and\nmany a night endeavoured to founder me. She was the first to recognise\nin my spirit something different from mere cleverness, something she\nhad seen and recognised in her books, but had never before met in a\nliving person. I had known her only six months when she died, but her\nwords of encouragement have been ringing in my ears ever since they\nwere uttered.\n\nMy grandfather had also died; a straightforward, honest, simple man,\nwith a mortal dread of being in debt, and always well prepared to pay\nhis rates and taxes. He had a horror of being a principal in the\npolice courts, but appeared there three times for no offence of his\nown. Called upon once to examine a rope supposed to be stolen from a\nship he proved the rope was of the land, and different from a ship's\nrope--discharge of the prisoner. On another occasion, Sunday morning,\nand grandfather being in bed, a detective, disguised as a poor working\nman that was almost dying for a drink, wheedled the old man's daughter\nto sell him some liquor over the back wall--the result being a summons\nfor supplying drink during closed hours, followed by a heavy fine,\nwhich was at once paid. The third time was at my trial with five other\ndesperadoes, as described in the preceding chapter. There was nothing\nfalse about this man, and he had the heart of a lion. He claimed to\nhave beaten the champion of Portsmouth, but undoubtedly this was some\ndrunken fellow who had taken on himself this much coveted title.\nGrandfather's pet yarn, which I have heard him recount a hundred\ntimes, took place in a public house, where a thin partition divided\nhim from another person who was loudly extolling himself to the\nadmiration of others. Grandfather allowed this man to continue for\nsome time, but at last, losing patience, he looked around the\npartition and cried in a stern voice, \"Avast there, Captain Jones: I\nknew thee when thou wert glad to eat barley bread without butter.\"\nCaptain Jones looked disconcerted at this remark and then, quickly\nputting his own head around the partition, whispered: \"Hush, hush,\nCaptain Davies; there's nothing like making one's self look big in a\nstrange place.\"\n\nI was now in the last year of my apprenticeship, and was running a\nbit wild, taking no interest in my trade, and determined in a few\nmonths to throw off all restraint. When my time had expired, my master\nwanted me to continue working for him, which I did for a short time;\nand, for one who had not yet reached his twenty-first year, received a\nvery fair wage. In three or four months I found some excuse for\nleaving. I was eager to start for the new world; but my grandmother\nwould not, on any account, supply money for that purpose; so I applied\nfor work at Bristol, was accepted, and worked there six months, being\nthen called home through the death of the good old lady. The licence\nindulged in during these six months, being in a strange town and\nunknown, was sufficient to wreck the brains and health of any man\nbeyond recovery, and for the time being deadened all literary\nambition. It could not have continued this way much longer, and no\ndoubt, it was her death that prevented the collapse of my life, by a\nchange of circumstances. Her estate was in the hands of a trustee, and\nits profits were to be divided weekly among her three grandchildren.\nShe was a good old soul, and I have lived long enough to cherish every\nhair of her head. She was a Baptist, stoutly opposed to other\ncreeds--called the stage the Devil's Playground--abhorred second\nmarriages--and thought as much of me in life as I think of her in\ndeath. Many of the little kindnesses that were given to her in life\nwere done more out of a sense of duty than from the gratitude of\nwhich she was so worthy. But the good old soul died without suspecting\nany other than gratitude. Mine is the shame and sorrow that she did\nnot receive it, as I am even now, thirteen years after her death,\nliving on her bounty. When my grandmother died, I joined home with\nmother and her second family, but after a month or two of\nrestlessness, I sought the trustee, got an advance from him of some\nfifteen pounds, and full of hope and expectation embarked for\nAmerica.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMANHOOD\n\n\nOn arriving at Liverpool, I made the acquaintance of a man who had\nbeen in America some years previously, and not having his hopes\nrealised at that time, had returned desperate to England, taken in a\nfresh cargo of hopes, and was now making a second attempt with as much\nenthusiasm, if not more, than others in making their first. In him I\nplaced implicit confidence, and received such an extraordinary\ndescription of that country, the number of stories of some of its\nhighest buildings which were called skyscrapers; the houses of wood\nwhich could be moved from one street to another without in any way\ninterfering with the comfort of the people within, cooking, sweeping\nand washing going on without hindrance; the loneliness of its prairies\nand deserts; engineering triumphs over high mountains; and how the\nglorious South was flushed with roses what time the North could not\nsave a blade of green from the snow; all this happening under the one\nwide spreading flag: this made such an impression on me that I at once\nwent to the steerage cabin and wrote a full description of the\ncountry, that very first evening aboard; telling of my arrival in\nAmerica, and the difference between the old and the new world. This\nletter was given to the steward at Queenstown, and was written to save\nme the trouble of writing on my arrival, so that I might have more\ntime to enjoy myself. Several years elapsed before it occurred to me\nhow foolish and thoughtless I had been. The postmark itself would\nprove that I had not landed in America, and they would also receive\nthe letter several days before it would be due from those distant\nshores. I can certainly not boast a large amount of common sense.\n\nIt was in the month of June, when we made this voyage, and the great\nAtlantic was as smooth as an inland river. Every one sought to escape\nthe thoughts of home, and to do so, we often worked ourselves into a\nfrenzy of singing and dancing. Sometimes our attention would be drawn\nto an iceberg on the port side, very innocent and beautiful to the\neyes of passengers, but feared by mariners, who saw into its depths.\nAnd then a ship full sail; or another great Atlantic liner on the\nstarboard bow. There was a total lack of ceremony aboard, strangers\nfamiliar with strangers, and the sexes doing each other little\nkindnesses, who had never met before and probably would never meet\nagain, parting without even enquiring or giving each other a name. As\nwe neared the coast we had a thunderstorm, and I was surprised and\nsomewhat awed at the sound of its peals, and at the slower and larger\nflashes of lightning. Nature, it seemed, used a freer and more\npowerful hand in this country of great things than is her wont among\nour pretty little dales, and our small green hills. I thought the\nworld was coming to an end, and in no way felt reassured when an\nAmerican, noting my expression, said that it was nothing to what I\nwould see and hear if I remained long in God's own country of free and\nlaw abiding citizens.\n\nMy impression of Americans from the beginning is of the best, and I\nhave never since had cause to alter my mind. They are a kind,\nsympathetic race of people and naturally proud of their country. The\nIrish-American is inclined to be the most bitter, remembering from his\nyouth the complaints of his parents, who were driven through unjust\nlaws from their own beloved land; and such a man is not to be idly\naggravated, for life is a serious subject to him. This man is not to\nbe aggravated, especially under the consideration that our conscience\nis not too clean in this respect, and that we are apt to be very slow\nin making that open confession which is good for the soul. The most\npleasing trait in Americans, which cannot for long escape us, is their\nrespect for women and the way in which the latter do their utmost to\ndeserve it. No sight of a woman behind the saloon bar listening to the\nribald jests of drunken men, and no woman at the bar's front drinking\nglass for glass with her associates. However weak in this respect a\nwoman may be in private, she is certainly too strong to make a public\nexhibition of her weakness. Husband and wife may be unhappy, but you\nseldom hear of a woman carrying the marks of a man's brutality as\nwitnesses against him which is so common in the police courts of old\nEngland. A man in a fit of ungovernable passion may kill his wife; and\nbetter so, I should say, than to leave her half killed at the foot of\nthe stairs every Saturday night and holidays for twenty or thirty\nyears, and blacken her eyes before they can recover their natural\ncolour, the brutality that shamed me so much in after years in the\nslums of London, hearing it so often recorded as a jest.\n\nI was so anxious to see the different states of America that I did not\nstay long in New York before I succumbed to the persuasion of my\nLiverpool acquaintance to visit with him some friends in a small town\nin the state of Connecticut, at which place we soon arrived, with\nsomething like ten dollars between us. America, at this time, was\nsuffering from a depression in trade, and people were daily returning\nto the old country, most of them with the intention of returning again\nto America at a more favourable time. Not being able to get employment\nat once, and resolved to be independent of the bounty of strangers, I\nwalked out alone, and sat on a seat in the park, trying to conceive\nsome plans for the future. My box, full of clothes, books, brushes,\netc., would amply compensate, I thought, for the week's lodging which\nI had had. Yes, I would see Chicago: and, suddenly becoming aware of a\nman occupying the other end of the seat, I enquired of him the way to\nChicago, as though the distance was a paltry ten miles, instead of a\nhundred times greater. This man looked at me in astonishment, and at\nlast asked me if I intended to beat my way. Seeing my lack of\nunderstanding, he enquired as to my financial resources. On shaking my\nhead in the negative, implying that I had no money, he said. \"No more\nhave I: and if you are agreeable, we will both beat our way to\nChicago.\"\n\nThis was Brum, a notorious beggar, who made himself at home in all\nparts of the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, and from\nthe northern provinces of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The easy and\nsumptuous way of his catering made me indifferent to all manual\nlabour. In that country, where food was to be had for the asking,\nwhere it often went begging to be received, and people were not likely\nto suffer for their generosity, I became, under Brum's tutorage, a\nlazy wretch with but little inclination for work. Cockneys make good\nbeggars. They are held in high esteem by the fraternity in America.\nTheir resources, originality and invention, and a never faltering\ntongue, enable them to often attain their ends where others fail, and\nthey succeed where the natives starve. But my friend Brum held them in\ngreat scorn, for their methods were not his methods. Brum was a\ngenuine beggar, who did not make flashes in the dark, having one day\nplenty and nothing on the next day. What he required he proceeded to\nbeg, every morning making an inventory of his wants. Rather than wash\na good handkerchief he would beg an old one that was clean, and he\nwould without compunction discard a good shirt altogether rather than\nsew a button on--thus keeping up the dignity of his profession to the\nextreme. He scorned to carry soap, but went to a house like a\nChristian, and asked to be allowed to wash, with a request for warm\nwater if the morning was cold. Begging was to him a fine art, indeed,\nand a delight of which he never seemed to tire. I have known him, when\nsurfeited with an abundance of common food, such as steak, chops,\netc.--to beg lozenges and sweets, complaining I suppose, of throat\ntroubles. Even in a new country like America, there are quite a number\nof hostile towns, owing to their lying on the main roads between large\ncities that are not far apart; but Brum never seemed to fail, and\nwould certainly never lower his dignity by complaining of difficulty.\nIn every street, he said, there lived a good Samaritan, and seeing\nthat a good beggar knocks at every door, he must ultimately succeed.\nShe may live in the last house, and therefore the unsuccessful\nbeggar, having no patience and perseverance, fails in his calling.\nBrum was a slow man in action and went about his business in a dogged\nway. And that reminds me of how this slowness of action once saved his\nlife. We had built a camp fire in the woods, within a mile or more of\na small town. Now, it was Brum's habit, before lying down for the\nnight, to wind his handkerchief around his neck, and this he had done.\nNext morning I was the first to rise, and Brum, deliberately following\nmy example, began in his own easy way to slowly unwind this\nhandkerchief, when to my horror a large tarantula fell from its folds.\nNow, had Brum been an impulsive man, no doubt the spider would have\nbeen squeezed, and would have then fastened on his neck and poisoned\nhis blood mortally.\n\nI was soon initiated into the mysteries of beating my way by train,\nwhich is so necessary in parts of that country, seeing the great\ndistances between towns. Sometimes we were fortunate enough to get an\nempty car; sometimes we had to ride the bumpers; and often, when\ntravelling through a hostile country, we rode on the roof of a car, so\nas not to give the brakesman an opportunity of striking us off the\nbumpers unawares. It is nothing unusual in some parts to find a man,\nalways a stranger, lying dead on the track, often cut in many pieces.\nAt the inquest they invariably bring in a verdict of accidental\ndeath, but we know different. Therefore we rode the car's top, so as\nto be at no disadvantage in a struggle. The brakesman, knowing well\nthat our fall would be his own, would not be too eager to commence\nhostilities. Sometimes we were desperate enough to ride the narrow\niron rods, which were under the car, and only a few feet from the\ntrack. This required some nerve, for it was not only uncomfortable,\nbut the train, being so near the line, seemed to be running at a\nreckless and uncontrollable speed, whereas, when riding on the car's\ntop, a much faster train seems to be running much slower and far more\nsmooth and safe. Sometimes we were forced to jump off a moving train\nat the point of a revolver. At other times the brakesmen were\nfriendly, and even offered assistance in the way of food, drink or\ntobacco. Again, when no firearm was in evidence, we had to threaten\nthe brakesman with death if he interfered with us. In this way Brum\nand myself travelled the States of America, sleeping at night by camp\nfires, and taking temporary possession of empty houses.\n\nOne night, when darkness had overtaken us, before we could find a fit\nand comfortable place for camping, we spied a house, and seeing no\nlight in the window, presumed it to be unoccupied. We knocked at the\ndoor, and the hollow sound which followed convinced us that no living\nperson was then on the premises. When we lifted the latch and entered\nwe were surprised to see chairs, a table and various articles of\ndomestic utility scattered in confusion on the floor. In spite of this\nwe proceeded to make ourselves easy for the night, and coming out\nagain began to feel in the darkness for wood. Being successful in our\nsearch we returned and made a fire, and there we slept until morning.\nAs usual, I was the first to rise on the following day, and went forth\nin quest of water to make our breakfast coffee. This I soon found, and\nwas bearing it along, when my attention was drawn to a board nailed to\nthe front of the house. There I saw the letters \"Haunted,\" painted\nlarge, and ragged, as though by a hand that had shaken with fear. If\nwe had seen this board on the night previous, no doubt we would have\nhurried on in dread of our lives, but as it was, we made our coffee\nand laughed heartily in the daylight. At this time I took a notion to\nwork for a few days, but Brum showed his grinning face so often that I\ngrew ashamed of him, and discharged myself. He seemed to have taken a\nstrange liking to me, and would not leave me, but swore that not even\nfor my sake would he become a working man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBRUM\n\n\nBrum was a man of an original turn of mind and his ideas were often at\nvariance with others. For instance, all tramps in America travel on\nthe railroad, whether they walk or take free rides. Therefore it seems\nreasonable to infer that the people who live on the outskirts of a\ntown, being farthest from the track, would be more in sympathy with\ntramps, for they would see and hear less of them. But Brum laughed at\nthis idea, and claimed that his own success was through being of a\ndifferent mind. \"For,\" said he, \"as all tramps are of that opinion,\ntherefore the outskirts are begged too much and the centre of the town\ntoo little. For instance,\" he continued, \"here is the railroad depot,\nwith its restaurant; now, not one tramp in a hundred would visit such\na place, for it is on their direct road, and they believe that it\nreceives far too many appeals. This opinion, being so common, must\nprove it to be false. However, we will test it and see.\" Saying which\nBrum boldly entered the restaurant, leaving me to wait outside. It was\na considerable time before he reappeared, and I began to think that\nhe was being supplied with a meal on the premises, but at last he\ncame, carrying in his hand a large paper parcel. \"The place is as good\nas gold,\" said he, \"for here we have a day's provisions for two. Take\nit down the track to that clump of woods,\" said he, \"for the waiter\npromised that did I bring a jug or can he would supply me with hot\ncoffee.\" I started at once towards the woods with this bag, the weight\nof which proved the presence of either much meat or pudding; while\nBrum made his way to a small house near the railroad to see if he\ncould borrow a can. It was not long after this when we were seated in\nthe shady green wood with the contents of this parcel before us, which\nwere found to consist of a number of chops, bread and butter, some\npotatoes and cake. These, with a quart or more of good hot coffee,\nmade such a meal as a working man could only reasonably expect once a\nweek--the day being Sunday.\n\nOne of Brum's peculiarities was, on approaching a town, to look out\nfor a church steeple with a cross, which denoted a Catholic church,\nand therefore a Catholic community. Making his way in the direction of\nthat cross he would begin operations in its surrounding streets,\n\"and,\" said he, \"if I fail in that portion of the town, I shall\ncertainly not succeed elsewhere.\"\n\nI shall never forget the happy summer months I spent with Brum at the\nseaside. Some of the rich merchants there could not spare more than a\nmonth or six weeks from business, but, thanks be to Providence, the\nwhole summer was at our disposal. If we grew tired of one town or, as\nmore often the case, the town grew tired of us, we would saunter\nleisurely to the next one and again pitch our camp; so on, from place\nto place, during the summer months. We moved freely among the\nvisitors, who apparently held us in great respect, for they did not\naddress us familiarly, but contented themselves with staring at a\ndistance. We lay across their runs on the sands and their paths in the\nwoods; we monopolised their nooks in the rocks and took possession of\ncaves, and not a murmur heard, except from the sea, which of a\ncertainty could not be laid to our account. No doubt detectives were\nin these places, but they were on the look out for pickpockets,\nburglars and swindlers; and, seeing that neither the visitors nor the\nboarding house keepers made any complaint, these detectives did not\nthink it worth while to arrest tramps; for there was no promotion to\nbe had by doing so. \"Ah,\" I said to Brum, as we sat in a shady place,\neating a large custard pudding from a boarding house, using for the\npurpose two self-made spoons of wood--\"Ah, we would not be so\npleasantly occupied as tramps in England. We would there receive\ntickets for soup; soup that could be taken without spoons; no pleasant\npicking of the teeth after eating; no sign of a pea, onion or carrot;\nno sign of anything, except flies.\" Two-thirds of a large custard\npudding between two of us, and if there was one fault to be found with\nit, it was its being made with too many eggs. Even Brum was surprised\nat his success on this occasion. \"Although,\" as he said, \"she being a\nfat lady, I expected something unusual.\" Brum had a great admiration\nfor a fat woman; not so much, I believe, as his particular type of\nbeauty, but for the good natured qualities he claimed corpulence\ndenoted. \"How can you expect those skinny creatures to sympathise with\nanother when they half starve their own bodies?\" he asked. He often\ndescanted on the excellencies of the fat, to the detriment of the\nthin, and I never yet heard another beggar disagree with him.\n\nAfter seeing Brum wash the dish, and wipe it with his\npocket-handkerchief, with a care that almost amounted to reverence,\nand trusting in my own mind that the good lady would have the thought\nand precaution to wash it again--I settled to a short nap, till Brum's\nreturn. For there was no knowing how long he might be away; he might\ntake a notion to beg a shirt, a pair of trousers or shoes, or anything\nelse that came to his mind.\n\nNow, when Brum left, he had on a dark shirt, but I was so accustomed\nto seeing him change his appearance with a fresh coat, or a different\nshaped hat, that I was not at all surprised on waking to see him\nsitting before me in a clean white shirt with a starched front. I said\nnothing about this change, and he was too good a beggar to give\nunsolicited information, which would look too much like boasting of\nhis own exploits. That he had met another of his favourite fat ladies,\nor perhaps the same one had added to her kindness--there was not the\nleast doubt.\n\nBrum's first words rather startled me, for he continued the\nconversation from the place I left off previous to my sleep. \"When I\nwas in England,\" he began, \"I did not experience such hardship as is\ncommonly supposed to exist. Beggars there, as here, choose the wrong\nplaces, and not one in three knows which are the best.\" \"Surely,\" I\nsaid, \"a good clean street of houses with respectable fronts, of\nmoderate size, and kept by the better class mechanics, are the best?\"\n\"And so they would be,\" he answered, \"if every beggar did not think\nso. But let me tell you, for your benefit if ever stranded in England,\nthe best places for beggars to operate.\" How I learned the truth of\nhis wise teaching, in after days! Every fine looking street you chance\nupon, pass it; but every little court or blind alley you come across,\ntake possession without delay, especially if its entrance is under an\narch, which hides the approach to the houses, making them invisible\nfrom the street. Such little out of the way places are not only more\nprofitable than good streets, but are comparatively safe where the\npolice are unusually severe. Then again you should avoid every town\nthat has not either a mill, a factory, or a brewery; old fashioned\ntowns, quiet and without working people--except a few gardeners,\ncoachmen, domestic servants, etc: such places where you see a sign at\nthe free libraries warning tramps not to enter, and every plot of land\nhas its sign--\"Beware of the Dog.\" In towns where working men are\nnumerous, and the idle rich are few, such signs are not to be seen.\n\"Of course,\" he continued, \"your object in England must be money, for\nyou cannot expect to get meat, cake and custard pudding in a land\nwhere even the rich live poorer, with regards to diet, than the\nlabouring classes of this country.\" I remembered these wise thoughts\nof Brum, uttered on the shores of the Atlantic, and if I did not\nprofit much by them in my own experience in England, I certainly made\nenough attempts to test their truth. I always kept a keen eye for\nblind alleys, and quiet courts under arches, and I invariably came out\nof one richer than I went in. And what nice quiet places they are for\ndrinking cups of tea on a doorstep, with only a neighbour or two to\nsee you, and perhaps thousands of people passing to and fro in the\nstreet at the other side of the arch. There is no thoroughfare for\nhorses and carts; no short cut for business men, and the truth of the\nmatter is that a number of the inhabitants themselves, born and bred\nin the town, know not of the existence of such places; and others,\nknowing them, would be ashamed to confess their acquaintance with\nthem. But Brum knew where to find the kindest hearts in England, not\nin the fine streets and new villas, but in the poor little\nwhite-washed houses in courts and alleys.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA TRAMP'S SUMMER VACATION\n\n\nWe were determined to be in the fashion, and to visit the various\ndelightful watering places on Long Island Sound. Of course it would be\nnecessary to combine business with pleasure, and pursue our calling as\nbeggars. With the exception of begging our food, which would not be\ndifficult, seeing that the boarding houses were full, and that large\nquantities of good stuff were being made, there was no reason why we\nshould not get as much enjoyment out of life as the summer visitors.\nWe would share with them the same sun and breeze; we could dip in the\nsurf at our own pleasure, and during the heat of the day we could\nstretch our limbs in the green shade, or in the shadow of some large\nrock that overlooked the Sound. However we could no longer stand the\nsultry heat of New York, where we had been for several days, during\nwhich time we had been groaning and gasping for air. So I and Brum\nstarted out of the City, on the way towards Hartford, Connecticut,\nwith the intention of walking no more than six miles a day along the\nsea coast. What a glorious time we had; the people catered for us as\nthough we were the only tramps in the whole world, and as if they\nconsidered it providential that we should call at their houses for\nassistance. The usual order of things changed considerably.\nCake--which we had hitherto considered as a luxury--became at this\ntime our common food, and we were at last compelled to install plain\nbread and butter as the luxury, preferring it before the finest\nsponge-cake flavoured with spices and eggs. Fresh water springs were\nnumerous, gushing joyously out of the rocks, or lying quiet in shady\nnooks; and there was many a tramps' camp, with tin cans ready to hand,\nwhere we could make our coffee and consume the contents of paper bags.\nThis part of the country was also exceptionally good for clothes.\nSummer boarders often left clothes behind, and of what use were they\nto the landladies, for no rag-and-bone man ever called at their\nhouses. The truth of the matter was that in less than a week I was\nwell dressed from head to foot, all of these things being voluntary\nofferings, when in quest of eatables. Brum, of course, had fared\nlikewise, but still retained the same pair of dungarees, which he\nswore he would not discard except at the instance of a brand new pair\nof tweeds. It was this pair of working man's trousers which had caused\na most regrettable mistake. We had just finished begging at one of\nthese small watering-places and, loaded with booty, were on our way in\nthe direction of the camp which, Brum informed me, was half a mile\nnorth of the town. When we reached this camp we found it occupied by\none man, who had just then made his coffee and was about to eat. On\nwhich Brum asked this man's permission to use his fire, which would\nsave us the trouble of making one of our own. The stranger gave a\nreluctant consent, and at the same time moved some distance away, as\nthough he did not wish further intimacy. While we were gathering wood\nand filling our cans at the spring, I could not help but see this\nstranger glaring hatefully at my companion's trousers, and expected\nevery moment to hear some insulting remark. At last we were ready and\nBrum proceeded to unload himself. He had eight or nine parcels of food\ndistributed about his clothes, but in such a way that no one could be\nthe wiser. It was then that I noted a change come over the stranger's\nface, who seeing the parcels, seemed to be smitten with remorse. In\nanother moment he was on his feet and coming towards us, said\nimpulsively--\"Excuse me, boys, for not giving you a more hearty\nwelcome, but really--\"glancing again at my companion's trousers--\"I\nthought you were working men, but I now see that you are true\nbeggars.\" Brum laughed at this, and mentioned that others had also\nbeen deceived. He explained that the said trousers had been given him\nagainst his wish, but on seeing that they were good, and were likely\nto outlast several pairs of cloth, he had resolved to stick to them\nfor another month or two. \"I regret having had such an opinion of\nyou,\" said the stranger, in a choking voice, \"and trust, boys, that\nyou will forgive me.\" Thus ended in a friendly spirit what promised at\nfirst to become very unpleasant.\n\nThis stranger turned out to be New Haven Baldy. We had never had the\npleasure of meeting him before, but had often heard of him. He had a\ngreat reputation in the State of Connecticut, which he never\nleft--except for an annual trip through Massachusetts to the city of\nBoston. There was not one good house in the former State that was not\nknown to Baldy. This was put to the test in our presence, that very\nday. A man came to the camp who, poor fellow, claimed to be a\nhard-working man. He had lost his job and had been robbed of his\nsavings, now being forced to walk home to Meriden. He had never begged\nin his life, and had now been without food for two days, and was\nalmost too weak to continue his journey. \"Yes,\" said Baldy, \"and when\nyou are settled at home, and the wrinkles are taken out of you, what\nsympathy will you have with us? You will tell us to go and work for\nour living, the same as yourself.\" The poor fellow protested, saying\nthat he had never known his mother to refuse any man food. At this\nBaldy pricked up his ears and enquired of the stranger his mother's\naddress. On hearing the name of the street Baldy at once proceeded to\ndescribe the one--and only one--good house to be found there: \"That\nis our house,\" said the stranger. Baldy, not yet convinced, asked for\na description of the old lady and her husband. This was given, to\nBaldy's satisfaction. \"Well,\" said he, \"I have had many a meal at your\nhouse, and you shall now have one with me.\" Saying which he gave the\nstranger a parcel which, being spread on the grass, was seen to\ncontain several meat sandwiches and a number of small cakes. After\neating these, and others from Brum, the stranger left, saying that he\nwould not again feel hungry until he reached home.\n\nAfter the stranger had gone Baldy laughed immoderately. \"That man's\nfather,\" said he, \"was a railroad man, who became boss, and at last\nretired on a comfortable little sum. In the kitchen, where the old\npeople have often fed me, the old man has hung on the wall the shovel\nwhich he had used in his early days. There it is to be seen tasselled\nand kept shining bright, and treated reverently as a family heirloom.\nHow I have laughed,\" continued Baldy, \"to see that shovel, to think\nwhat a simple old fellow he must be to take a pride in showing how he\ntoiled in his early life. Every time I go there the old man points at\nthe shovel with pride, and I have as much as I can do to keep a calm\nface in listening to its history. But in spite of all that the old man\nis a good sort, and I am glad to have been able to assist his son.\"\n\nAlas, what a disastrous end was ours! When we reached the town of New\nHaven, we began to beg from passersby in the open streets and in less\nthan an hour were in jail. On being brought up next morning before the\njudge, we were each sentenced to thirty days. But what hurt our\nfeelings most was the personal comment of the judge--that we were two\nbrawny scoundrels who would not work if we had the chance. However\ntrue this might be as applied to us in a moral sense, it certainly was\nnot a literal fact, for we were both small men. People who, not seeing\nus, would read this remark in the local paper, would be misled as to\nour personal appearance. I am doubtful whether any Judge is justified\nin using such a term. At any rate, thirty days had to be served.\n\nWe were in a far better position than an Italian who was waiting to be\ntried for murder, and whose cell was not far distant from ours.\n\nAt this jail we had to perform the light labour of caning chairs, and\nwere well treated in the way of food and sleeping accommodation and,\nin addition, received a liberal supply of chewing tobacco.\n\nBeing interested in the Italian, the first thing we did on regaining\nour liberty was to enquire as to his fate. We were told that he had\nreceived a life sentence; or, as our alien informant strangely\nexpressed it--\"Antonia, he didn't get some of de time, but he got all\nof de time.\"\n\nThus what promised to be a summer's outing full of enjoyment, came to\na disastrous close sooner than we expected. And, when we were again\nfree, the summer season was practically over, the visitors were\ngradually leaving for their town houses; which meant that our\ntreatment at the boarding houses would become colder and colder in\naccordance with the number of boarders.\n\nAt this time I accepted employment as a woodchopper, but unfortunately\nthe work did not last; and just as I began to feel the inclination for\nthis more respectable life, I was discharged, much to Brum's delight,\nwho was apparently disgusted with this new innovation called work, and\ncould not understand any man's desire for it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA NIGHT'S RIDE\n\n\nAlthough I had at this time become lazy, losing almost all sense of\nrespectability, I often reproached Brum for the aimlessness of this\nexistence; telling him we must seek work and attend to other wants\nthan those of the body. I would tell him of the arts, and how the\ncultivation of them was lost to us through a continual lack of funds.\nI told him of the pleasures of reading, visiting picture galleries,\nmuseums and theatres, and of the wonders of instrumental music, and of\nthe human voice. Once when we were passing through a street in New\nOrleans, I paused to listen to a woman singing. Brum, like the\nfaithful companion he was, waited my pleasure, until he too seemed to\nbecome impressed by some unusual feeling. The song ended, and as we\nwent our way, I said--\"There, Brum, what do you think of that?\" \"O\nlor,\" he answered, awestruck, \"wasn't she a blooming cat!\" making me\nlaugh heartily at such a strange expression of praise, knowing that it\nwas meant to be truthful and sincere.\n\nHaving done a few days' work, as mentioned in the preceding chapter,\nI resolved to come to an understanding with Brum at once as to our\nfuture plans. With this end in view, I invited him to a drink, and\nthus began: \"What do you intend doing? Your life is not mine. We often\ngo for days without reading matter, and we know not what the world is\nsaying; nor what the world is doing. The beauty of nature is for ever\nbefore my eyes, but I am certainly not enriching my mind, for who can\ncontemplate Nature with any profit in the presence of others. I have\nno leisure to make notes in hopes of future use, and am so overpacking\nmy memory with all these scenes, that when their time comes for use,\nthey will not then take definite shape. I must go to work for some\nmonths, so that I may live sparingly on my savings in some large city,\nwhere I can cultivate my mind.\" Now, Brum's method of begging was\ndifferent in large cities from what it was in the country. In the\nlatter he found no use for money, except for hair cutting or shaving;\nand when this became necessary he never failed to get the requisite\namount for his purpose. When he was ready to have this office\nperformed, it was his custom to interview the Catholic priest of the\ncommunity, and beg the use of his razor, knowing it was part of that\nperson's creed to shave continually. Of course, the priest would not\nthink of lending his razor to an entire stranger, but seldom refused\nthe ten cents that were necessary for that operation. But in the large\ncities, Brum scorned private houses, and begged money in the streets,\nand in their various stores; purchased his meals at a restaurant, and\npaid his lodgings like an honest man. Therefore, thinking my\ndiscontent was mainly owing to the lack of funds, he said--\"All this\nhaste from place to place is not at all to my liking. If you wish to\nsettle in a large city, I can guarantee two dollars a day at the\nleast, between us, for a visit to the theatre, music hall, for books,\npapers, or an occasional glass of grog.\" \"No, no,\" I said, \"we must\neither work or part. There are three dollars, half of my earnings, so\nplease yourself whether we work or part, whether you go or stay; for I\nhave already decided my own course. What is it to be?\" \"Well,\" said\nhe, after a long pause, \"we are now near to the hop country, and they\nstart picking sometime next week; that is about the only work to be\nhad at this time of the year.\"\n\nUpon this we had several drinks, for I was so pleased at Brum's\ndecision, that I ordered drink after drink with bewildering\nsuccession. Brum informed me of a freight train that was to leave the\nyards at midnight, on which we could beat our way to a small town on\nthe borders of the hop country. Not knowing what to do with ourselves\nuntil that time arrived, we continued to drink until we were not in a\nfit condition for this hazardous undertaking--except we were fortunate\nto get an empty car, so as to lie down and sleep upon the journey. At\nlast we made our way towards the yards, where we saw the men making\nup the train. We kept out of sight until that was done and then in the\ndarkness Brum inspected one side of the train and I the other, in\nquest of an empty car. In vain we sought for that comfort. There was\nnothing to do but to ride the bumpers or the top of the car, exposed\nto the cold night air. We jumped the bumpers, the engine whistled\ntwice, toot! toot! and we felt ourselves slowly moving out of the\nyards. Brum was on one car and I was on the next facing him. Never\nshall I forget the horrors of that ride. He had taken fast hold on the\nhandle bar of his car, and I had done likewise with mine. We had been\nriding some fifteen minutes, and the train was going at its full speed\nwhen, to my horror, I saw Brum lurch forward, and then quickly pull\nhimself straight and erect. Several times he did this, and I shouted\nto him. It was no use, for the man was drunk and fighting against the\noverpowering effects, and it was a mystery to me how he kept his hold.\nAt last he became motionless for so long that I knew the next time he\nlurched forward his weight of body must break his hold, and he would\nfall under the wheels and be cut to pieces. I worked myself carefully\ntowards him and woke him. Although I had great difficulty in waking\nhim, he swore that he was not asleep. I had scarcely done this when a\nlantern was shown from the top of the car, and a brakesman's voice\nhailed us. \"Hallo, where are you two going?\" \"To the hop fields,\" I\nanswered. \"Well,\" he sneered, \"I guess you won't get to them on this\ntrain, so jump off, at once. Jump! d'ye hear?\" he cried, using a great\noath, as he saw we were little inclined to obey. Brum was now wide\nawake. \"If you don't jump at once,\" shouted this irate brakesman, \"you\nwill be thrown off.\" \"To jump,\" said Brum quietly, \"will be sure\ndeath, and to be thrown off will mean no more.\" \"Wait until I come\nback,\" cried the brakesman, \"and we will see whether you ride this\ntrain or not,\" on which he left us, making his way towards the\ncaboose. \"Now,\" said Brum, \"when he returns we must be on the top of\nthe car, for he will probably bring with him a coupling pin to strike\nus off the bumpers, making us fall under the wheels.\" We quickly\nclambered on top and in a few minutes could see a light approaching\nus, moving along the top of the cars. We were now lying flat, so that\nhe might not see us until he stood on the same car. He was very near\nto us, when we sprang to our feet, and unexpectedly gripped him, one\non each side, and before he could recover from his first astonishment.\nIn all my life I have never seen so much fear on a human face. He must\nhave seen our half drunken condition and at once gave up all hopes of\nmercy from such men, for he stood helpless, not knowing what to do. If\nhe struggled it would mean the fall and death of the three, and did\nhe remain helpless in our hands, it might mean being thrown from that\nheight from a car going at the rate of thirty miles an hour. \"Now,\"\nsaid Brum to him, \"what is it to be? Shall we ride this train without\ninterference, or shall we have a wrestling bout up here, when the\nfirst fall must be our last? Speak?\" \"Boys,\" said he, affecting a\nshort laugh, \"you have the drop on me; you can ride.\" We watched him\nmaking his way back to the caboose, which he entered, but every moment\nI expected to see him reappear assisted by others. It might have been\nthat there was some friction among them, and that they would not ask\nassistance from one another. For instance, an engineer has to take\norders from the conductor, but the former is as well paid, if not\nbetter, than the latter, and the most responsibility is on his\nshoulders, and this often makes ill blood between them. At any rate,\nAmerican tramps know well that neither the engineer nor fireman, his\nfaithful attendant, will inform the conductor or brakesman of their\npresence on a train. Perhaps the man was ashamed of his ill-success,\nand did not care to own his defeat to the conductor and his fellow\nbrakesmen; but whatever was the matter, we rode that train to its\ndestination and without any more interference.\n\nAs we neared the town we saw a large camp fire in a small dingle near\nthe track, at which a man lay asleep. Seeing this comfortable sight,\nand being cold and tired, we made up our minds to jump off the train\nas soon as possible, and to return to that fire for a few hours'\ncomfort. The whistle blew for the station, and the train began\ngradually to slacken speed, when we jumped from the bumpers; and our\nlimbs being stiff, we staggered and fell, but received no hurt. It\nmust have been a mile or more back to that place, but we arrived there\nin due time, and without waking its solitary occupant, were soon\nstretched out fast asleep on the other side of the fire. When we awoke\nthe stranger had already been to town, had returned with food, and was\nnow making coffee in a tomato can, all of which he generously offered\nto share with us. This I gladly accepted, but Brum declined with\nthanks, saying that he was always capable of getting his own meals,\nand if needs be, could beg enough for half a dozen others. I gave this\nstranger my entire confidence, and soon learnt that he had come to\nthese parts for the same purpose. \"We three,\" said he, \"will work\ntogether on the same land, and under the one master. I am a moulder by\ntrade,\" he continued, \"and a week ago I had a hundred dollars saved,\nbut went on the spree, and am now probably without a cent.\" To my\nsurprise, at this stage of the narrative, he unlaced his right boot\nand began to feel in its toes, at the same time shaking his head\ndespondently. After which he put it on again and laced it. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid, taking off his coat and feeling the lining, \"a week ago I had a\nhundred dollars saved.\"\n\nBrum, having now returned from town laden with sandwiches, cakes,\netc., and he having had a hot dinner from a convent we packed those\nnecessaries for future use, and started on foot for the hopfields.\nEvery now and then the stranger--whom Brum at once called Australian\nRed, owing to his being born in that country, and his having a florid\ncomplexion--would try our patience extremely by sitting on fallen\ntimber and taking off his boot, sometimes the two; and after feeling\nin them, replacing them on his feet, with a sigh of disappointment.\nOften he would take off his hat and minutely examine the lining, to\nour unfeigned astonishment. At one time we lost patience with him. He\nhad seen a low stack of timber, and requested a few moments delay. On\nthis being granted, Australian Red began to take off his garments one\nby one, and to examine them. Not one article was placed aside without\nhaving undergone a thorough scrutiny, until nothing but his shirt\nremained. All this waste of time was very trying to our patience, and\nwhen he was again dressed, we requested him at once for all to put a\nstop to such manoeuvres. We walked on in silence, but had scarcely\ncovered a short mile, when Red was seen to be preparing to strip for\nanother investigation. On seeing which Brum, losing a little\npatience, said:--\"Look here, old fellow, if such is going to be your\nconduct, you can't, on no account, travel any further with us.\" For a\ntime Australian Red looked undecided, and then let his coat slip back\nto its position. \"It is like this,\" he said, \"I am a moulder by trade;\na week ago I had a hundred dollars saved, but where are they now? It\nis always my custom,\" he continued, \"when I go on the spree, to\nsecrete my money in some safe place. Although I have no recollection\nof doing so, I am positively assured that such has been the case; and\nwould not be surprised at any moment to discover a twenty dollar bill\nin the lining of my clothes; but, with regards to the boots, I am now\nthoroughly satisfied.\" When I became better acquainted with Australian\nRed, this peculiarity was often made apparent to me. Perhaps he did\nsecrete money, for I have oftened wondered as to where it had\nvanished. Whether or not, it was certainly never to be found on his\nperson, and must have been slipped under the mat in strange places,\ndropped into vases, or hidden behind looking glasses.\n\nIn a day or two we reached the hop-fields and all three succeeded in\nbeing hired by the same farmer. This could not have very well been\ndifferent, as neither one would have otherwise worked. The season, if\nI remember right, lasted between three and four weeks, which we began\nand finished, but were not very well satisfied with the financial\nresult. Our total earnings were, clear of all expenses, about forty\ndollars, and with that amount we walked to the nearest large town\nintending to beat our way to New York and paint it a forty dollar red.\nWe reached the said town, and made enquiries of a switchman as to when\nthe next freight train would be leaving for New York. The sight of a\nflask of whiskey in the hands of Australian Red enlightened us\nconsiderably as to the time of trains, their qualification for\ncarrying human freight, and the cruel or kind disposition of their\nattendant crews. We made choice of a train leaving about dusk, and\nfinding an empty car on a side track, we entered it, to wait as\npatiently as possible until that time came. We were not so quiet as we\nshould have been, considering that we were trespassing on the\nrailroad; and that is why we were soon startled by a voice crying:\n\"What are you doing there? Do you know that you are trespassing on the\nrailroad?\" With that the marshal of the town stood before the open\ndoor, showing the star of his authority on his dark clothes. \"I can't\nget any sleep day or night, through you fellows,\" he said; \"consider\nyourselves under arrest.\" Saying this, he marched us off at the point\nof a revolver, and began seeking the judge for our trial at that\nstrange hour of the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nLAW IN AMERICA\n\n\nAs he marched us along, he made several enquiries as to our finances,\nto know if we were prepared to pay a fine. Being assured of this he\ntook a very despondent view of our case.\n\nBrum explained afterwards, when it was too late, that trespassing on\nthe railroads was always considered a very serious offence during this\nmonth of the year, when men were returning with their small earnings\nfrom the hopfields; which were not sufficient to enable them to travel\nas passengers. He explained that trespassing on the railroad was not\nonly overlooked, but was openly encouraged when men had to pick hops\nto fill their pockets; but as soon as those pockets were filled by\npicking hops, the local magistrates lost no time in giving the police\nstrict orders to fall to, arrest and detain, so that a picker's pocket\nmight be picked by them of his little earnings.\n\nThe marshal stopped several citizens, enquiring as to the whereabouts\nof a person named Stevens. To my surprise, we were not lodged for the\nnight in the common jail, but were led into a public house, which in\nthat country is referred to as a saloon. As we entered this place, and\nstood in front of its bar, we did not look much like prisoners. Brum\ncalled for four drinks, and the marshal drank his respect for us in a\nvery friendly manner indeed. After which he took the landlord aside\nfor a short consultation, in which I heard the man Stevens mentioned\nmore than once. Then he came back and had another drink, this time at\nthe expense of Australian Red. Some customers now arrived, followed by\na lean, solemn looking person, whom the marshal took no time in\naccosting as Judge Stevens. This gentleman at once called for whiskey,\nthen looked from the marshal to us, and from us to the marshal, at the\nsame time nodding his head approvingly to the latter. The marshal\ncleared his throat and began: \"I found these men trespassing on the\nrailroad, and at once arrested them.\" The judge again nodded his head\nin approval to this red, burly individual, who had made a claim of\nbeing robbed of his sleep day and night, and turning to us said:\n\"Boys, we have to put a stop to these things, drink and follow me.\" He\nled the way into a small back room, and we followed with the marshal,\nthe citizens bringing up the rear. The marshal gave evidence of our\narrest, making special mention of our possession of money. The judge\nwished to be informed of the exact amount, and being told that it was\nsomething like ten dollars each, summed up the case at once. \"Boys,\"\nhe said, \"I fine you each five dollars, in default of which you must\ngo to Syracuse for thirty days\"--at which place was the county jail.\nNow, I was always outspoken, and was never forced by fear, under any\ncircumstances, to conceal my thoughts, which if I saw real injustice\nor hypocrisy, would be blurted out in a more dignified court than\nthis. This mock trial, which at first had been highly amusing,\nexasperated when it came to paying half of my hard earnings, so I told\nthis judge plainly that my friends might please themselves, but that\nhe would not get one cent out of me. Brum supported me in this, but\nAustralian Red began to finger his dollars, whereat the marshal\nquickly snatched them out of his hand, deducted five dollars, which he\ngave to the judge, and returned the rest. Judge Stevens looked at us\nsteadily for a time, and then asked this astounding question: \"Boys,\nhow much are you prepared to pay?\" Brum, who had very little sense of\njustice, and being such a good beggar, set very little value on money,\nasked the judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us. If I\nhad been alone at this time I would have paid nothing, but to save\nBrum from going to prison, who I knew would support me through all, I\nsatisfied myself that, if the judge approved of this amount, I would\npay it without further comment. The judge appeared to weigh the\nmatter seriously, and then cried, with a magnanimity that was\nirresistible--\"Pass over the dollars, boys; you shall have a chance\nthis time.\"\n\nThe trial was not here ended, as most of us believed. A citizen, who\nhad been an interested spectator of this scene, and who had been\nfidgetting in his seat for some time, now rose to his feet, and\nsaid--\"Where is the justice of this? These men are all guilty of the\nsame offence, and yet one is fined five dollars, and the other two get\noff more leniently, with the loss of three dollars each; this\ncertainly cannot be called justice.\" At this the Judge showed the\nfirst signs of passion. \"Sir,\" he shouted in wrath, \"who is the Judge,\nI or you? If you ever again interfere with our proceedings, in this\nmanner, I shall fine you for contempt of court--contempt of court,\nsir, contempt of court.\" This citizen and lover of justice, collapsed\nstricken with awe, bluffed and discouraged. \"Come, boys,\" said the\nJudge, and he led the way back to the bar. There, he produced a two\ndollar bill, which was part of our fine, and called for drinks for the\nhouse. We followed his example, late prisoners and citizens, and were\nall happy together until a late hour.\n\nThe marshal, who seemed to have a little respect for me, for having\nshown the spirit of free speech before the judge, took me aside and\nasked whether we intended to take advantage of the invitation given by\nthe citizen who had been threatened for contempt of court--to spend\nthe night at his house. \"I don't think so,\" I said; \"we have had\nenough of this town, and intend leaving it to-night.\" Shortly after\nthese words we left the saloon, but had scarcely reached the street\nend, when I heard steps following, and to my surprise, the marshal was\nsoon at our side. Now comes the most extraordinary part of this story,\nwhich I have often been diffident in relating, thinking it would not\nbe credited. \"Boys,\" said this burly fellow, who could not get any\nsleep day or night, \"get you to the railroad, and if any one\ninterferes with you, tell them that the marshal sent you; I shall be\nwith you in about twenty minutes.\" We were soon at the railroad, were\nnot interfered with, and the marshal followed in a short time.\n\"Listen,\" he said to us, who were again trespassers on the railroad,\nat his pleasure and instigation: \"There is a train already made up to\nstart in five minutes' time; get into this empty car, and by heavens,\nno man shall interfere with you.\" Which we did, and when the train\nstarted, the marshal was there, beside the car, wishing us a pleasant\ngood-bye. \"Why,\" said Brum, when I commented in astonishment at all\nthis, \"it is nothing unusual. One day,\" he began, \"I was in a small\ntown in Ohio. Seeing a freight train leaving the station, I leaped\ninto an empty car, just as the train started. When safe inside, I\nturned and stood in the open doorway, and looking out, saw the marshal\nstanding on the platform, looking after me, so I waved him a sarcastic\nfarewell. But the train, instead of increasing in speed, began to\nslow, and coming to a standstill, began at once to back towards the\nstation. Before I could decide on my course of action, we were again\nstanding in front of the station, with my car facing the marshal, who\nseemed to have waited, expecting this to happen. 'Hallo,' he cried,\n'come out of that for you are under arrest.' I was lodged in jail, and\nwas next morning brought up for trial. The marshal gave evidence as to\nseeing me jump the train, and I was charged with that offence. Having\nno money, I was about to be sent to jail when the judge asked the\nmarshal to examine my hands which, although I had done no work for a\nnumber of years, were still hard and horny. I said that I was a\nseafaring man, and exhibited pictures of boats and anchors tattooed on\nmy arms, at the same time offering to show the _Polly Jane_ in full\nsail across my breast. My strange calling, in that inland town more\nthan a thousand miles from the coast, appeared to greatly interest the\njudge, who, after several friendly questions, discharged me with a\ncaution. Instead of at once taking advantage of my freedom, I sat\ndown, waiting the end of the court. Another prisoner was then brought\nup, who had been seen loafing on the station platform all the previous\nday. This prisoner pleaded guilty, and said that he had waited in vain\nfor hours for a freight train to carry him to his destination, he\nhaving no money to pay his fare as a passenger. \"Hold,\" cried the\nmarshal, \"that is a lie, for I myself saw a train steaming out when\nyou were loafing indifferently on the platform.\" \"Ten dollars, or\nsixty days,\" said the judge. This will show you how one prisoner was\ncharged for stealing a ride on a freight train, and another prisoner\nwas charged for not doing so as the opportunity occurred, happening in\nthe same court, and under the same judge. Again,\" continued Brum, \"I\nknow a prisoner, in an adjoining state, who was sentenced to ten years\nfor embezzlement. The money was never recovered, and he probably has\nit safe until his time expires. This prisoner is receiving a salary of\nten dollars a week for keeping the prison books, is allowed to\nconverse with any one, and is entrusted to go the rounds of the\nturnkey. He is the one man allowed to wear private clothes, and is\neven allowed at night the liberty of a stroll in the open air, and\nunattended, with the one stipulation that he returns before a certain\nhour at night. And,\" continued Brum, \"what with the money he has\nconcealed--held probably by a relative--and his weekly salary of ten\ndollars as the bookkeeper of the prison, he will never need work more,\nafter his sentence is served. But, listen to me,\" continued Brum more\nearnestly, \"some of these queer laws are to a tramp's advantage. The\nwinter is already here, and promises to be a most severe one. Now, if\nyou would like to rest and grow fat during the coldest months, come\nwith me to Michigan. You can there enter jails without committing\noffence of any kind, and take ten, fifteen, twenty or thirty days, all\nat your own sweet discretion. No work to do, good food to be had, and\ntobacco daily supplied. There is nothing else but begging before you,\nfor the coming winter,\" said Brum, warming to his subject, \"but if you\nlike to enter with me those blessed havens of rest, where one can play\ncards, smoke or read the time away, you will become strong and ready\nfor work when the spring of the year arrives.\"\n\nThis project did not seem to me to be very attractive. For one thing,\nit was a long journey to that part of the country, and the weather\nbeing cold, we were forced to travel at night and sleep in the day. I\nwas certainly not a very pleasant companion at this time, being\noccupied so much with my own dreams, which ever took the one shape of\na small comfortable room with a cosy fire; books, papers, tobacco,\nwith reading and writing in turns. At any rate, we decided to follow\nBrum's suggestion, and, instead of going to New York, we got off, and\ntook another road.\n\nWe had a rough time in beating our way to Michigan. We were marched\nout of one town by the marshal, where we were waiting to catch a\ntrain. This necessitated us either to walk three miles to catch a\ntrain as it was on a grade, or to walk ten miles to the next watering\ntank, where all freight trains stopped. We decided on doing the\nformer. To do this required an activity of which I hardly thought Brum\nto be capable. The grade was long and before the train reached the\ntop, its speed would be slackened to about ten miles an hour, or less,\nif it had heavy freight. It was necessary to lie low, and out of\nsight, until the train appeared, and then run beside it, so as to leap\nand catch the handle bar, the feet at the same time catching the iron\nstep; after doing which we could step on to the bumpers, or climb the\nladder to the top of the car. If either the hand or foot failed to do\nits duty, it meant a fall, and a very serious accident or death. I was\nthe youngest and most active, and leapt the first part of the train.\nAs soon as I was safe I looked around the car, and had the pleasure of\nseeing Australian Red succeed just three cars behind, and Brum\nsucceeding on the next car to him. When we reached the next stopping\nplace, we all got together on the same car, so as to be prepared for\nany trouble with the train's crew. A brakesman passed over the top,\nand shouted to us in a friendly manner; passed and re-passed several\ntimes before the train reached its destination, but treated our\npresence with the utmost indifference, which is often the case in that\npart of America.\n\nWhat a difference it made in our feeling, this changing of seasons! It\nseemed but a few days ago the birds were singing, the orchards were\nheavy and mellow with fruit, and we could sleep in the open air all\nnight. It was now necessary to light great fires, when the front parts\nof our bodies burned whilst a cold chill crept up and down the spine;\nand the first fall of snow, which was likely to occur at any time,\nwould soon make it difficult to enjoy even this small comfort.\n\nAt last we reached a small town in Michigan which, Brum informed us,\nwas the county town; and which, said he, chuckling with delight, had\nan exceedingly pleasant jail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nA PRISONER HIS OWN JUDGE\n\n\n\"Now,\" said Brum, as the freight train steamed into the town and came\nto a standstill, \"we must see the marshal.\" With this end in view we\nwalked towards the passenger depot, which, Brum informed us, was\nvisited by the marshal several times a day, so that he might the\nbetter accost such tramps as were going through that town. We arrived\nat that place and stamped up and down the platform, to circulate our\nblood, for it was now snowing heavily, and the wind blowing in small\ngusts that discovered us, shelter wherever we would.\n\nHow the snow falls in the north! Flake on flake falling incessantly,\nuntil the small dingles are almost on a level with the uplands. It\nthrows itself on the leaves of Autumn, and holds them down in security\nfrom the strongest winds. It piles great banks against people's doors,\nand mothers and daughters are made prisoners to their own hearths,\nuntil fathers and sons set to and cut a path to the open thoroughfare.\nSpecial snow trains are at work clearing the track to make the way\neasier for passenger trains and freight trains that run on passenger\nlines, being loaded with cattle or other perishable goods; whilst\nother freight is often delayed for days, and sometimes weeks.\n\nWe had been here some fifteen minutes, when we saw the marshal coming\ndown the road leading to the station, the bright star of his authority\nbeing seen distinctly on his breast. \"Now,\" said Brum, \"let me be the\nspokesman, and I will arrange for a month's comfort.\" By this time the\nmarshal stood before us. \"Boys,\" he began, \"cold weather for\ntravelling, eh?\" \"We don't feel the cold,\" was Brum's reply. \"You will\nthough,\" said the marshal, \"this is but the beginning, and there is a\nlong and severe winter before you, without a break. You would\ncertainly be better off in jail. Sixty days in our jail, which is\nconsidered one of the best, if not the best, in Michigan, would do you\nno harm, I assure you.\" \"As for that,\" said Brum, \"we might take\nthirty days each, providing of course, that you made it worth while.\nWhat about tobacco and a drink or two of whiskey?\" \"That'll be all\nright,\" said the marshal, \"here's half a dollar for a drink, and the\nsheriff will supply your tobacco.\" \"No, no,\" objected Brum, \"give us a\ndollar and three cakes of tobacco, and we will take thirty days, and\nremember, not a day over.\" The marshal produced the three cakes of\ntobacco, seeming to be well prepared for these demands, and giving us\na paper dollar, requested us to go to Donovan's saloon, which we\nwould find in the main street, where he would see us later in the day;\n\"when of course,\" he added, winking, \"you will be supposed to be just\na bit merry.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this?\" I asked Brum, as we went our way to\nMr. Donovan's saloon. \"It simply means this,\" he said, \"that the\nmarshal gets a dollar each for every arrest he makes--in our case\nthree dollars; the judge receives three or four dollars for every\nconviction, and the sheriff of the jail is paid a dollar a day for\nboarding each prisoner under his charge; we benefit by a good rest,\nwarmth, good food and plenty of sleep, and the innocent citizens have\nto pay for it all.\"\n\nWe had not much difficulty in finding Donovan's saloon, which we\nentered, and called for whiskey. It so happened that two strangers\nwere there, who had made a considerable stake in the backwoods, and\nhad come to this town to squander their earnings. We therefore came\ninto many a free drink, through the liberality of these men. About an\nhour and a half had elapsed when we discovered ourselves to be alone\nin the bar, and without means of procuring more liquor. \"We had better\nbe going,\" said Brum, and we passed into the street. Brum saw the\nmarshal coming up the road and began singing in a lusty voice, to the\nastonishment of some of the storekeepers. Australian Red, being the\nworse for drink, and forgetting that we had only to feign this part,\nbegan to roar like a bull, merry in earnest. On this the marshal\nquickly crossed the street and in the hearing of several citizens,\nshouted in an authoritative voice:--\"I arrest you for being drunk and\ndisorderly,\" and we followed him like lambs. We were then led to the\nsheriff's house, adjoining the jail. That gentleman, being in,\nreceived us with open arms saying--\"Welcome, boys, you want thirty\ndays, and thirty you shall have, no more or less; and you will be none\nthe worse for it, I promise you, at the end of the month.\" He then\nmade a few casual items in a large book, roughly descriptive of our\nweight, height, and personal appearance, and then led the way through\ntwo or three corridors, until we were confronted by a large iron door.\nThis he opened with an iron key, and we were ushered into a large\nroom, where were assembled between thirty or forty prisoners. Some\nwere reading, some were pacing to and fro, and several batches of them\nwere playing cards. What a reception we had, bringing in a fresh\nsupply of information from the outside. \"Have you seen Detroit Fatty?\"\nasked one. \"Or the Saginaw Kid?\" asked another. \"Or Chicago Slim?\"\nasked another. Brum, who seemed to know these wonderful persons,\nanswered according to his knowledge.\n\nIn this large room, for the common use of the prisoners, were twenty\nor more cells, to which they retired for sleep, but were never locked\nin--except maybe, an occasional prisoner, who might be waiting trial\nunder a charge of grand larceny, manslaughter, or murder. Supper was\nsoon brought in, and it was a good substantial meal. Its quantity\nseemed to be more than idle men needed, if they had three such meals\nevery day, and its quality would satisfy me in any position in life.\nWhat a pleasure it was that night to be in warmth, and with our minds\neased of a month's anxiety. \"What time are you going to do?\" asked\none. \"Thirty days,\" answered Brum. \"Plenty,\" said the other. \"There is\nmore jails than this, and not much difference in them, and to go out\nin the cold for a day or two makes us better appreciate the warmth and\ncomfort within.\"\n\nNext morning we were taken by the sheriff to the court-house, where a\nnumber of town people were assembled, owing to the more interesting\ntrial of a local man. I have often thought with amusement of this\nscene. Despite the judge's severe expression, and his solemn\ndeliberate utterance, we knew what to expect,--thirty days, no more or\nless. The sheriff whispered to the judge, and the judge nodded sagely,\nat the same time casting his eyes in our direction. We were charged\nwith being drunk and disorderly, and with disturbing the public peace.\n\"He did not see,\" he said, \"why peaceable citizens should be disturbed\nin this way by drunken strangers, and would fine us seven dollars and\ncosts, in default of which we would be lodged in the county jail for\nthirty days.\" We were then led back by the sheriff, and when we were\nagain among the prisoners, they seemed to express very little\ncuriosity as to our sentences, knowing it was our wish that we should\nreceive thirty days, and that the judge was at our pleasure--we being\nin fact our own judges.\n\nEvery morning the sheriff required half a dozen prisoners to sweep and\nclean the court-house, which was situated about half a mile from the\njail. Australian Red and myself went with him several mornings, for a\nlittle fresh air, but prisoners could please themselves, and Brum, I\nknow, never left the jail during the whole thirty days. It was an\nunderstood thing that any prisoner could discharge himself on these\noccasions, if inclined, without any fear of capture. The Marshal and\nthe Judge had had their dollars for arrest and conviction, and I\nsuppose, the sheriff charged for board and lodging, without mention of\na prisoner's escape. Perhaps they were afraid of bringing back an\nescaped prisoner, for fear he might make some awkward disclosures. At\nany rate, liberty could be had by a very deliberate walk and there was\ncertainly no need to make a desperate dash for it. Of course, there\nwas no reason why any prisoner should seek to escape these conditions,\nwhich were of his own seeking, and which, during this unpleasant time\nof the year, could not in any way be bettered by homeless men.\n\nAfter serving our sentence, and the sheriff exacting a promise from us\nto return again that winter, if not the following, we sought another\njail some twenty miles from the last, which prisoners had spoken\nhighly of. We were told that there was no necessity at this place of\ngoing through the form of an arrest, but that we could go straight in\nout of the cold. The Sheriff would at once receive us at his house,\nlearn our wants, while the judge would attend to us on the following\nmorning.\n\nWe arrived at this place, and everything turned out as described. The\njail was no different from the other. We were catered for as customers\nthat would, if treated with courtesy and good living, return winter\nafter winter, and patronise this place in preference to visiting the\nmore congenial climate of the south. At this place we sentenced\nourselves to another thirty days. Our room, like the other, was a\nlarge iron cage, in which were twenty-four cells in a double row, main\nfloor and gallery, like little cages within it. As we entered this\nlarge cage, the sheriff opening the iron door, a number of jail-birds\nwere singing merrily, not for liberty, but enjoying such captivity.\nThere was only one real prisoner here, who was waiting trial under a\ncharge of manslaughter, and he was the one prisoner to be locked in\nhis cell at night; and, in that cell, had waited trial a most cold\nblooded murderer. Here we had the usual amusements of card playing,\nsinging and relating experiences.\n\nThe real prisoner--for none of the others had been guilty of any\noffence, having entered of their own free will--was very unfortunate\nin having a pair of wags quartered in the cell above him. These two\npractical jokers made a figure of their bed clothes, and letting it\ndown, dangled it in front of this prisoner's cell. The poor wretch,\nhappening to be awake, and thinking this was Bill Henderson, murderer,\nand late occupant of the cell, come to haunt him, leaped from his bed,\ncrying with a horror-stricken voice--\"Bill Henderson, by God!\" Before\nhe could recover from his fear and make a more calm investigation, the\nfigure was withdrawn. All this happened as expected, and the prisoners\nwere delighted, for they had been hinting all day about Bill\nHenderson's ghost, so that it might take hold of this poor wretch's\nnerves. Once only during the night was this accomplished, so that\ntheir victim might have no suspicion as to its being a genuine ghost.\nEvery time the sheriff appeared the prisoner complained to him of this\nghost murderer, pleading for a removal, or an early trial. That\ngentleman invariably listened with a sarcastic smile, seeming to have\nsome notion of the truth, by glancing at the faces of the other\nprisoners. How these sheriffs, marshals and constables, despise\ncowardice, and how they respect the intrepidity of dangerous men.\nMany a sheriff, I believe, has surrendered his prison keys to the\nlynchers and the lawless mobs, forgetting his duty in disgust at the\nexhibition of fear in one for whom he is responsible. And many a\nsheriff would lay down his life to protect a criminal who with cool\nnerve faces his cell, callous and indifferent.\n\nWe visited, and were entertained, in several jails during this winter,\nand emerged from the last in the middle of April.\n\nI have heard since that this system of boodle, as it was called, was\nin the following winter entirely squashed. A sheriff, it seemed, being\nof an avaricious disposition, had interfered with the quality and\nquantity of the prisoners' rations. Therefore, when respectable\ncitizens visited the jail to speak a few sympathetic words to the\nprisoners, which they usually did on Sunday, those discontented\njail-birds complained of insufficient picking; and informed the\ncitizens that they had been guilty of no offence; that they had\nentered the jail through being promised enjoyment, and that those\nexpectations had not been realised. On hearing this, the citizens\nformed a committee, and soon discovered the whole system to be rotten.\nSeeing how they had been robbed, they deposed several officers and the\nupshot of it was that travellers never again visited that part of\nAmerica in quest of comfortable jails.\n\nFor a day or two the least exertion tired us, owing to our winter's\ninactivity, but take it all in all, we were certainly in good bodily\ncondition. It was now that Australian Red made his first proposal. He\nknew a fruit farm, where he had been previously employed, \"in this\nvery State,\" said he, \"on the shores of Lake Michigan.\" \"How long does\nthe work last?\" I asked. \"All the summer,\" he answered, \"and good pay\nfor an active man.\" \"All right,\" I said, \"if I can make a pretty fair\nstake, I shall then return to England and home.\" Brum agreeing to\nthis, we lit a fire that evening near a water tank, intending to take\nthe first freight train that came our way. When the train arrived, we\nstill dallied at the fire, which was a considerable distance from the\ntrack. It whistled before we expected and began its journey. \"Break\naway,\" cried Australian Red, making a rush for the departing train.\nThe speed of the train was increasing and when I reached its side I\nwas almost afraid to attempt to board it. Australian Red succeeded,\nbut when we reached the next stopping place, we were greatly\ndisappointed to find that Brum had been left behind. We got off and\nwaited the arrival of other trains, thinking that he would soon follow\nus, but as Brum did not appear on any of them, we continued our\njourney, thinking to see him later. I never saw him again. He had\ncomplained of the year not being sufficiently aired for freedom, and\nhad proposed another short term in jail. No doubt, after losing us he\nhad done this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nBERRY PICKING\n\n\nWe reached the fruit country a week or two before picking commenced,\nbut although we were in advance of time, and without a cent, the\ngenerosity of the farmers supplied all our wants. The authorities did\nnot in the least interfere with us, though we lit large camp fires on\nthe outskirts of the towns, took possession of hay ricks and empty\nout-houses, and loafed for hours in their principal streets. They knew\nwell that the assistance of every man would be needed to strip the\nvines of their berries, which promised a supply exceeding that of\nformer years. Friday morning, it being generally known that picking\nwas to commence on the following Tuesday, Australian Red remarked that\nit was now time to interview the farmer, for whom he had previously\nworked. With this object in view, we left the pretty inland port of\nSt. Joseph, and strolling leisurely, we reached that farm in two\nhours, it being only five miles from the town. The farmer and his\nwife, who employed several servants of both sexes, but were without\nchildren of their own, at once recognised Australian Red, and gave\nhim a kindly welcome, which spoke well for Red's gentlemanly behaviour\nin the past. The old man told him, in his bad English, that there\nwould always be plenty of work for Red, and for others whom he might\nbring with him.\n\nI was about twenty-three years of age at this time, appeared much\nyounger and not in any way looking like a dangerous youth, was soon on\nthe best of terms with the old people. So much so, that at the end of\nthe summer, when the pickers were leaving, the result being as\nsatisfactory to themselves as to the farmer, the kind old couple\ninveigled me into a private place and proposed to adopt me as their\nown son, and that they would teach me how to run the farm, which they\nsaid would become mine at their death. The only way to answer these\nkind people was to say that I already had a good home, and parents\nliving in England, and that I intended to return there with the\nprofits of this summer's work.\n\nThe earliest fruit was the strawberries, whose vines grew from six\ninches to a foot above the ground. We knelt in the hot blazing sun\nwhich beat so powerfully on our bended necks that the flesh became in\na day or two the dark colour of walnut stain. The soil, being dry and\nsandy burned through the clothing until our knees were covered with a\nrash. The effect of this extreme heat often affected people's\nreasons, and sometimes killed them outright. Berry picking in the\nSouth has other dangers of a worse kind. I shall never forget seeing a\nman leap screaming to his feet, at the same time wringing his right\nhand in agony. He had parted the thick vines, in quest of the berries\nthat were concealed under the leaves, and in doing so, had disturbed a\ndeadly snake, which had bitten his offending hand. The snake was very\nsmall, but far more deadly than many others of twenty times its length\nand weight. Several deaths occurred this way in my berry picking\nexperience in the South. There was not much fear of this happening in\nthe State of Michigan, but we often wished we could crawl under the\nlow green leaves of the vine to escape for a time the rays of the sun.\nThe farm extended to the shores of the lake, and when our day's work\nwas at an end, we hastened there, and plunged into the cold and\nunsalted water which never grew warm, and could be swallowed with\nimpunity. After which we would return, cook supper in the open air,\nand wrapping ourselves in blankets lie all night under the thick\nfoliage of a tree. The berries were sent every night to Chicago for\nthe morrow's market; but, there being no market on Sunday our day of\nrest was Saturday, and we picked on Sunday for Monday's market. Early\nevery Saturday morning Australian Red would go to town in the farmer's\nbuggy, and return to us later in the day with papers, tobacco,\nmatches, and such provisions as we needed; for eggs, butter, milk,\npotatoes and fruit could be had of the farmer, the latter delicacy\nbeing free for the trouble of picking.\n\nRed seemed to me to be a man above the average intelligence, and, as\nfar as my knowledge went, seldom made an error in grammar or the\npronunciation of words. But that he should think words required a\ndifferent pronunciation in reading from what they did in speaking, was\na great shock to me, and made some of his most illiterate hearers look\nfrom one to another with stupefaction. Now, I was always greatly\ninterested in fights and glove contests, and Red, claiming to have\npersonal acquaintance with the best of Australia, and himself claiming\nto be an amateur middle weight, whose prowess many a professional had\nenvied, often entertained me with little anecdotes of them, which had\nescaped the notice of sporting papers. So, on the first Saturday of\nour picking, Red returned from town with a paper which gave a full and\ngraphic account, round by round, of a contest for the light weight\nchampionship of the world, the principals hailing respectively from\nAustralia and America. Red's sympathies, of course, were with the\nformer, who, to his elation, had defeated his opponent. Being a very\nmodest man, Australian Red had always quietly perused his paper,\nmaking few comments, so as to avoid all argument; but on this\noccasion, he opened his paper and began to read with a boldness that\nastonished me. But what surprised me most was the way in which he\nmade use of an expletive syllable, which sounded so quaint as to make\nlaughter irresistible. For instance, this passage occurred in\ndescribing the fifth round: \"After he was knocked down, he picked\nhimself up painfully, and the blood flowed from his nostrils in\ncopious streams.\" I could not help laughing out at his strange\ndelivery, and Red, thinking my sympathies were with the bruiser from\nthe Antipodes, chuckled with a real, but more quiet delight. We had\nenough food for conversation that day, in commenting on this contest.\nI like to see a good scientific bout by men who know the use of their\nhands, but would rather walk twenty miles than see animals in strife.\nAlthough of a quiet disposition, my fondness for animals is likely at\nany time to lead me into danger. After reading cases of vivisection I\nhave often had dreams of boldly entering such places, routing the\ndoctors with a bar of iron, cutting the cords and freeing the animals,\ndespite of any hurt I might receive from bites and scratches. Perhaps\nI should cut a ridiculous figure, walking through the crowded streets\nwith a poor meek creature under each arm, but that would not bother me\nmuch in the performance of a humane action.\n\nAfter a good month's work at the strawberries, we had three weeks at\npicking raspberries, followed by four weeks blackberry picking. There\nwas good money to be made at the strawberries, but much less at the\nraspberries. The blackberry picking was as lucrative as the\nstrawberry, and, being cultivated on the low bushes that seldom\nrequired us to stoop, was not such a tedious occupation as the latter,\nwhose vines were often half buried in the soil. After paying all\nexpenses, I had, at the end of the season, cleared over a hundred\ndollars.\n\nIt was now the last of the picking, and the farmer paid us off. He was\na German, and nearly all the farmers in that part of the country were\nthe same, or of that descent, and they used the German language at\nevery opportunity, and never used English except when it was necessary\nto do so. \"You vos come again, next summer,\" said he to Australian Red\nand myself as we were leaving--\"for I know you two plenty.\" This\nremark made me blush, for it seemed as much as to say that his\nknowledge of us was more than he desired--but we understood his\nmeaning. He offered to drive us to St. Joseph, but we preferred to\nwalk, as we had all day and half the night to wait before the boat\nstarted from that place to Chicago.\n\n\"Now,\" I said to Australian Red, as we jogged along, \"I am going to\nhoard the bulk of my dollars, and shall just keep two or three handy\nfor food and incidental expenses, for I am now about to beat my way\nfrom Chicago to New York. From the latter place I shall pay my passage\nto Liverpool, clothe myself better, and then take train for South\nWales, and still have a pound or two left when I arrive home.\" \"Come\nand have a drink,\" said Red, \"and I will then inform you how any man\nwithout former experience on sea or ship, neither being a sailor,\nfireman or cook, can not only work his passage to England, but be paid\nfor doing so.\"\n\nWe had had no intoxicating liquor for several months, and, though we\nhad passed one or two of these places on our way to St. Joseph, on\nwhich he had gazed in a rather too friendly manner, his courage, up to\nthis moment, had not been equal to an invitation. \"Well,\" I said,\npleased with the prospect of not only saving my passage money, but\nalso of earning my train fare in England--\"it will certainly be cold,\ntaking this deck voyage across the lake in the early hours of morning,\nand a glass of whiskey will keep some warmth in us.\" Alas! the usual\nthing happened--we got full; and what with the dead effects of the\ndrink, and a rough passage across, we arrived in Chicago feeling cold,\nstiff, and in many other ways uncomfortable.\n\nI have often heard salt water mariners sneer at these fresh water\nsailors, but, after crossing the Atlantic some eighteen times, and\nmaking several passages across the lakes, my opinion is that these\nvast inland lakes are more dangerous to navigate, and far less safe\nthan the open seas.\n\nOf course, we had to have more whisky, after the voyage, and, having\nhad to sleep, its effect was almost instantaneous. Not altogether\nlosing my senses, I suggested to Red that we should go to some hotel,\nhave breakfast, and then go to bed for an hour or two, say till dinner\ntime, which would refresh us. It was now eight o'clock in the morning,\nand Red had unfortunately got into conversation with a gentleman who\nknew something of Australia. \"Yes,\" he said, gravely, after listening\nto my proposal--\"you are young, and you certainly look drunk and\nsleepy, and had better follow your own advice. The hotel is next door\nbut one to this, and you will find me here when you return.\" Not\nliking to take him by the shoulder, and to gently try to force him\naway from this stranger in whose conversation he evidently seemed to\ntake a great delight, not to mention doing such an action before the\nlandlord's face, I left him, made arrangements at the hotel for two,\nand then went to bed. Having had a good sleep, and a substantial meal,\nand feeling thoroughly refreshed, I now returned to Red, whom I found\nin the centre of half a dozen loafers, besides the gentleman to whom I\nhave already referred. On my appearance, he staggered to his feet and\ncame to meet me, and then, taking me on one side, began in this way:\n\"You have just come in the nick of time, for the glasses, as you see,\nare empty. Pay for all drinks called for, and I will make it all right\nwith you in the morning.\" \"What is the matter?\" I asked. \"What have\nyou done with over eighty dollars?\" Winking artfully, and with a smile\nmeant to be cunning, he said--\"I have hidden my money, as I usually do\nin these cases. Most likely it is in the lining of my coat; but,\nwherever it is, you may depend on it as being quite safe.\" If he had\nhad the assistance of a score of the most inveterate drunkards, I know\nhe could not in this short time have squandered between eighty and\nninety dollars. Red had earned ninety-five dollars and a half, and, up\nto the time of my leaving him, had spent but very little. I came to\nthe conclusion that he had been robbed, and that this befell him in\nall his sprees. After calling for a round of drinks, I left the house,\nknowing that Red would soon follow, which he did, and at once. I\npersuaded him to bed, and the next morning saw the same peculiarities\nas before--his going into corners, up side streets, to feel the lining\nof his clothes. He was not satisfied at seeing no tear in the lining\nof his cap, but must hold it in his hand and feel every inch of it.\n\"Somewhere on my person,\" he reiterated, \"I have secreted three twenty\ndollar bills. I have a distinct recollection of doing so, but for the\nlife of me I cannot remember what part.\" \"You have been robbed,\" I\nanswered, with a little disgust. Not willing to leave him in his\npresent circumstances, and only too sorry that I had not done so when\nhe was almost as well off as myself, I shared my dollars with him,\nsaying in an offended manner--\"The sooner we squander this stuff the\nbetter it will please us.\" We spent it in one week in Chicago, and\nwere again without a cent. \"Again,\" I said with some exaggeration,\n\"winter is here, and we are in the same position as at the end of last\nsummer. What now?\" \"We are without money,\" said Red, \"but there is\nstill nothing to prevent us from our first intention of visiting\nEngland. We will beat our way to Baltimore without delay. I am known\nin that port by the cattle foremen and owners, and we are almost sure\nof a ship as soon as we arrive.\" After all, I thought, eager for a new\nexperience, one trip will not come amiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE CATTLEMAN'S OFFICE\n\n\nWe found the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad easy to beat, and were at the\nend of our journey in a very few days. When we entered the cattleman's\noffice, from which place owners and foremen were supplied with men, it\nwas evident to me that Red was well known in this place, hearing him\nmake enquiries of Washington Shorty, New York Fatty, Philadelphia\nSlim, and others. At this place I made the acquaintance of Oklahoma\nSam, an extremely quiet man, very much respected in that he had a cold\nblooded fashion of whittling wood and paring his nails with a steel\nblade nearly a foot long. Another queer character was Baldy, of whom\nAustralian Red related this anecdote. When stranded in Liverpool and\nhungry, he once took up a position in front of a confectioner's shop,\nand, being an extremely lazy man, placed his shoulder against the\nlamp-post, and settled himself for a long reverie. He might have been\nthere an hour or more, when the baker came out and complained of\nBaldy's person, being ragged and dirty, as the reason why people\nhurried past his establishment; telling Baldy straight that his\npresence was detrimental to the trade of any shop that catered to the\ninner man. Baldy, too lazy to speak, much less show any signs of\nanger, took a firmer bearing on the post and settled to a more\nprolonged reverie. Two or three hours elapsed when the baker, who had\ncome several times to stare at him through the window, rushed out and\nshouted with much irritation--\"For Heaven's sake, go: here, take this\nsixpence, and let me see the last of you.\" Baldy, who had not wished\nthe baker good morning, wished him good afternoon, and strolled\nquietly away, with the price of a good meal in his hand. Nobody, who\nthoroughly understood Baldy's disposition, would wonder at this; for\nthis success, after all, was only the result of laziness, but most of\nhis companions gave him credit for using unique strategy in obtaining\nmoney.\n\nShelter only was supplied at this office, and that of the barest kind,\nbeing no other than the hard floor, and blanketless. Owing to this the\nmen, who, after making a trip often had to wait sometimes two or three\nweeks for another chance, were all good beggars. Some of them had\nbegged Baltimore off and on for ten years, and knew every good house\nin the city. One would say--\"I shall go to the dressmaker for my\nbreakfast\"; another intended to go to the dairy, the fat woman, or the\ndentist; the latter being always good for money in the shape of a ten\ncent piece.\n\nWe had been at this office three days, when the shipper sent\nAustralian Red and myself, with four others, to rope cattle at the\nyards. Seven hundred and fifty head of cattle had to be shipped that\nnight, and the ropes had to be placed on their necks or horns, with\nwhich they had to be fastened to their places aboard ship. After Red\nhad taken a rope, and given me a practical illustration of what was to\nbe done, the cattle began to arrive. They were very wild, having just\ncome from the plains of the west. There was a long narrow shoot in the\nyards, with one end blocked, and when a number of cattle had been\ndriven into this, and had wedged themselves too close and fast to be\ncapable of any wild movement, it was our business to slip a noose\naround their horns, or necks, draw this rope as tight as possible, and\nfasten it with a knot, so as to prevent it from slipping. When this\nwas accomplished, the end of the shoot was opened, and they were\nrushed out with their ropes dangling, and a fresh batch were then\ndriven in and served likewise. After which they were put in cars and\nsent to the ship. Now the foreman, knowing Red, asked him if he would\nlike to go with him, to which Red answered yes, at the same time\nputting in a good word for me, which at once met with the foreman's\napproval. We were not therefore surprised, on our return, when the\nshipper called us into his private office to sign articles--Red to\nreceive two pounds for the trip, and myself thirty shillings, an\namount seldom paid to a raw hand, except on the recommendation of\nowner or foreman.\n\nI shall never forget the first night's experience, when the cattle\nwere brought to the ship in a train of cars. A large sloping gangway\nwas erected to span the distance between ship and shore, and up this\nincline the poor beasts were unmercifully prodded with long poles,\nsharpened at the end, and used by the shore cattlemen. The\nterror-stricken animals were so new to the conditions, that they had\nno notion of what was expected of them, and almost overleaped one\nanother in their anxiety to get away. What with the shout of savage\ntriumph, the curse of disappointment, and the slipping and falling of\nthe over-goaded steers, I was strongly tempted to escape the scene. As\nthe cattle were being driven aboard, we cattlemen, who had signed for\ntheir future charge, caught their ropes, which we were required to\nfasten to a strong stanchion board. Sometimes one would run up behind,\nand prevent himself from turning. On one of these occasions, I crossed\nthe backs of others, that had been firmly secured, so as to force this\nanimal to a proper position. The animal, whose back I was using for\nthis purpose, began to heave and toss, and at last succeeding in\nthrowing me across the back of the other, this one tossing and rearing\nuntil I was in danger of my life, only the pressure of the other\nbeasts preventing him from crushing my limbs. Taking possession of\nhis rope, I held it to a cattleman, who was standing waiting and ready\nin the alley, and he quickly fastened this refractory animal to the\ncrossboards. Now the foreman had been watching this, and coming to the\nconclusion that I was a good man with cattle, said he would like me to\nbe the night watchman. This undoubtedly does require a good man, as I\nsoon discovered, on the first night out. There were two lots of cattle\naboard, and for these two foremen, two lots of cattlemen, and two\nwatchmen. As all hands are available in the day, any difficulty with\nthe cattle can soon be attended to; if necessary, all hands taking\npart. But when there is any trouble at night, one watchman only has\nthe assistance of the other, who, of course, expects the same aid from\nhim, in cases of emergency. Now if a number of cattle have broken\nloose, and worked themselves into intricate positions, the watchman is\nsupposed to awake the foreman and his men to assist him, but one would\nrather struggle all night with his difficulties than to take these men\nat their word, knowing their peevishness and dislike for a man who has\ndisturbed them from a sound sleep. A watchman is therefore told to\ncall up all hands, if he cannot cope with the cattle under his charge,\nbut he is never expected to do so.\n\nWhat soon breaks the spirit of these wild animals is the continual\nmotion of the vessel. There is always plenty of trouble at first, when\nthey slip forward and backward, but in a few days they get their\nsea-legs, and sway their bodies easily to the ship's motion. The wild\nterror leaves their eyes, and, when they can no more smell their\nnative land, they cease bellowing, and settle calmly down. This\nrestlessness breaks out afresh when nearing shore on the other side,\nand again they bellow loud and often, long before the mariner on the\nlook-out has sighted land.\n\nWe also had on this trip two thousand head of sheep, quartered on the\nhurricane deck. When we were six days out there came a heavy storm,\nand the starboard side was made clean, as far as pens and sheep were\nconcerned, one wave bearing them all away. This happened at night, and\non the following morning the sheep men were elated at having less work\nto do during the remainder of the voyage. The cattle, being protected\non the main deck, and between decks, and their breath filling the air\nwith warmth, make the cattleman's lot far more comfortable than that\nof the sheep-men. The condition of the cattle can be seen without\ndifficulty, but ten or fifteen sheep lying or standing in the front of\na crowded pen, may be concealing the dead or dying that are lying in\nthe background. For this reason it is every morning necessary to crawl\nthrough the pens, far back, in quest of the sick and the dead, and it\nis nothing unusual to find half a dozen dead ones. The voyage would\nnot be considered bad if thirty sheep only died out of two thousand.\n\nWhat a strange assortment of men were these cattlemen and sheepmen.\nOne man, called Blacky, a bully without being a coward, fell in love\nwith a small white cat, which we had found in the forecastle. His\nruffianism at once disappeared, and every time he was at liberty,\ninstead of looking for trouble with his fellow-men, he could be seen\npeacefully nursing this cat, at the same time addressing it\nendearingly as \"Little White Dolly,\" and such simple language as a\nchild might use.\n\nIt was our duty to keep the cattle standing, and not to allow them to\nrest too long on their knees; and not let them, on any account,\nstretch full length in the pens. One reason for this was that a\nkneeling steer would be overstepped by his nearest neighbour, and if\nthe latter happened to rise, their ropes, which were so fastened as to\ngive them very little freedom, would be tightened and crossed,\nbringing their heads together in such close proximity, that they would\nmake frantic efforts to escape each other's presence. And another\nreason for not allowing them to lie down for any length of time was\nthat their joints would become so stiff as to make them almost\nincapable of rising, though goaded by the most heartless cruelty. I\nused the most humane methods to attain this end, and sought to inspire\nterror in them by the use of the most ferocious war-cry, which often\nsucceeded. If that failed to raise them, I struck them with a flat\nstick on the haunches, which they could scarcely feel, at the same\ntime not forgetting to use my voice. Not succeeding in this, I\nresorted to the old remedy, which rarely fails, standing at their\nbacks and twisting their tails. A bullock can kick in any direction.\nThere is terrible power in his side kick, also his front kick,\nthrowing his hind leg forward with a speed that is remarkable for such\nan unwieldy animal. But his back kick, when you stand back to back\nwith him, has not the least power to cause hurt. The other watchman\nand myself had about an equal number of cattle under our charge, and\nwhen I was in difficulty he kindly came to my assistance, and I did\nlikewise for him, although he seldom seemed to need other help than\nhis own. We made our rounds about every half hour. Sometimes I found a\nsteer in the alley; by some means or other he had cleared the head\nboard and, still being a prisoner, stood fastened outside the pen\ninstead of inside. Another time we would find one standing with his\ntail to the head-board, instead of his head, owing to the rope getting\nloose, or being broken; after which he had turned himself around to\nsee if there was any way of escape behind him. It required great care,\nin cases of this kind, to place them again in their original\npositions.\n\nUp till the fourth night we had experienced no bad weather, and the\ncattle had been quiet and requiring little care. On this particular\nnight my attention had been drawn several times to a big black steer,\nwhich, time after time, had persisted in lying down. At last, in pity\nfor the poor beast, I let him rest, thinking to get him into a\nstanding position at the last moment, when I went off duty, after\ncalling the foreman and his men. But when that last moment came I\nfailed in all my efforts to raise this animal, whose joints, I\nsuppose, had become stiff after a prolonged rest. I was not therefore\ngreatly surprised when the foreman came, after I had gone off duty, to\nthe forecastle, with the complaint of having found a number of cattle\nlying down, and one, he said, in particular, which must have been\nlying down half of the night. \"When I left the cattle,\" I said,\n\"nothing seemed to be wrong.\" \"Come up and see this one,\" he answered.\nI followed him on deck, and there I saw several cattlemen standing in\nfront of a pen, in which I recognised the big black steer. He was now\nlying full length in the pen, the others having had to be removed for\nhis convenience. \"See this,\" said the foreman, \"this creature should\nbe standing. Twist his tail,\" he continued, to a cattleman, who at\nonce obeyed. During this operation another cattleman fiercely prodded\nthe poor creature's side with a pitchfork, which must have gone an\ninch into the body. At the same time another beat the animal about\nthe head with a wooden stake, dangerously near the eyes. The animal\ngroaned, and its great body heaved, but it made no attempt to move its\nlegs. \"Wait,\" said the foreman then, \"we will see what this will do.\"\nHe then took out of his mouth a large chew of tobacco, and\ndeliberately placed it on one of the animal's eyes. My heart sickened\nwithin me, on seeing this, and I knew that I would have to be less\ngentle with these poor creatures to save them the worst of cruelty. In\na second or two the poor beast, maddened by pain, made frantic efforts\nto rise, tried again and again, and after seeing its great sides\npanting, and hearing a number of pitiful groans, it succeeded in the\nattempt.\n\nThese cattlemen are, as a rule, great thieves, and well the sailors\nand firemen know it, and especially the steward and cook. One evening,\nwhen the men had finished their day's work, and I was preparing to go\non duty for the night, I heard Blacky propose a night's raid on the\ncaptain's chickens, which were kept in a small coop under the bridge,\nand rather difficult to rob, considering the bridge was always\noccupied by the captain or one of his first officers. But, next\nmorning, on coming to the forecastle I was not greatly surprised to\nsmell a peculiar and a not unpleasant odour, coming from that place.\nBlacky and another had made their raid during the previous night,\nleisurely killing the chickens on the spot, which was certainly the\nbest plan. When I descended the forecastle steps, I saw that the stove\nwas red hot, on which was a large tin can full of potatoes, onions and\nchicken. I am not ashamed to say that I did not scruple to partake of\nthis rogue's mess, knowing from experience how this company ran their\nboats, allowing their stewards such miserly small amounts for\nprovisions, that the common sailors and firemen did not get sufficient\nfood to eat, bad as its quality was.\n\nWhen we arrived at Liverpool, we were not long clearing our decks of\ncattle. After one is forced to lead, which is often difficult to do,\nthey all follow, and it is the same with the sheep. It is more often\nnecessary to control their mad rush than to goad them on. We received\npayment aboard--Red two pounds, myself thirty shillings, one other a\npound, and the rest ten shillings each, which was to board and lodge\nus ashore for six days, when we would have passenger tickets back to\nthe port from which we had sailed. If the ship, from any cause, was\ndelayed over this number of days, we were to receive an extra half a\ncrown for every day over. Red, having been in Liverpool several times\npreviously, led the way to a cheap house, at which place I persuaded\nthem to pay down six nights' lodging, so as to make sure of some\nshelter, not forgetting to caution them against drink, as they would\nneed every penny of the remainder for food, which would be more\ndifficult to obtain in this country than their own.\n\nThese cattlemen are recognised as the scum of America, a wild, lawless\nclass of people, on whom the scum of Europe unscrupulously impose.\nThey are an idle lot, but, coming from a land of plenty, they never\nallow themselves to feel the pangs of hunger until they land on the\nshores of England, when their courage for begging is cooled by the\nsight of a greater poverty. Having kind hearts, they are soon rendered\npenniless by the importunities of beggars. Men waylay them in the\npublic streets for tobacco, and they are marked men in the public\nhouses--marked by their own voices. First one enters and makes a\nsuccessful appeal, who quickly informs another, and others as quickly\nfollow. These wild, but kind-hearted men, grown exceedingly proud by a\ncomparison of the comfortable homes of America with these scenes of\nextreme poverty in Liverpool and other large sea-ports, give and give\nof their few shillings, until they are themselves reduced to the\nutmost want. And so it was on this occasion. The next day after\nlanding, I made my way to the public library, for I had not enjoyed\nbooks for a considerable time. When I returned from this place,\nAustralian Red at once approached me to borrow money, with his old\nhint of having some concealed. On questioning the others, six in\nnumber, I found that these men had not the price of a loaf of bread\namong them. As for myself, I had not been drinking, and had only spent\nseven shillings, and a part of that had been given away in charity.\nFor even in the coffee-house ragged lads set their hungry eyes on\none's meal, and sidle up with the plaintive remark that they will be\nthankful for anything that is left. In such cases, who could help but\nattend to them at once, before attempting to enjoy his own meal? As\nfar as my money went I maintained Red and the others, but the day\nprevious to sailing, there was not one penny left. We were to sail the\nfollowing night, but would not be supplied with food until breakfast\ntime the next morning. When that hour arrived we were all weak from\nhunger, not having had food for over forty hours. When the food did\narrive in the forecastle, these hungry men strove for it like wild\nbeasts, without any system of equal shares.\n\nWhat a monotonous life we now had for thirteen days. No work; nothing\nto do but to eat and sleep. And how I had intended to enjoy this part\nof the trip! The few hours I had spent in the library, had brought\nback my old passion for reading, and, had it not been for the distress\nof others, I had now been the happy possessor of some good books. This\nwas not to be; for I was to lie in my bunk with but one\nconsolation--that I had sufficient tobacco under seal with the steward\nto last me until the end of the voyage. This new experience was a\ndisappointment, and it was my firm resolve, on returning to Baltimore,\nto seek some more remunerative employment, to save, and then to work\nmy passage back to England in this same way, and go home with my\nearnings.\n\nWe had a rough passage back, the ship being light, with little more\nthan ballast. One night the vessel made a fearful roll, and the lights\nwent dark, and we thought every moment that she would turn over. A\ncoal bunker was smashed by the waves, and large pieces of coal bounded\nacross the deck with a force that would have broken every bone in a\nman's body. Pieces of heavy wood, that would have cut off a man's feet\nas clean as a knife, slid across the deck from side to side. We\nthought the end had come, especially when we saw an old sailor rush on\ndeck in his bare feet, his shirt being his only apparel. Sleep was out\nof the question for some hours, for we were forced to cling to our\nbunks with all our strength, to save ourselves from being thrown out,\nwhen we would be rolled here and there, and soon battered into an\nunconscious state.\n\nWe reached Baltimore on the thirteenth day, and at once made our way\nto the cattlemen's office, intending on the morrow to make better\narrangements for the future.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nA STRANGE CATTLEMAN\n\n\nIt was now the beginning of October, and the mornings and the evenings\nwere getting colder. Although Baltimore is a southern town, and was\ntherefore free from the severe cold of towns further north, it was not\nso far south as to make plenty of clothes dispensable. We two,\nAustralian Red and myself, tramped this city day after day for work,\nbut without success. There were only two courses left open to us: to\nmake three or four more trips on cattle boats, until the coming of\nspring, when there would probably be work in abundance, or to go\noyster dredging down the Chesapeake Bay, a winter employment that was\nopen to any able-bodied man in Baltimore, experience not being\nnecessary. Red soon placed the latter beyond consideration by relating\nhis own hard experience of the same. First of all the work was very\nhard, and of a most dangerous kind; the food was of the worst; and,\nworse than all, the pay was of the smallest. A man would often cut his\nhands with the shells, which would poison and swell, and render him\nhelpless for some time to come. \"Again,\" said Red, \"a man is not sure\nof his money, small as it is. A few years ago,\" he continued, \"it was\na common occurrence for a boat to return and have to report the loss\nof a man. These dredgers were never lost on the outward trip, but when\nhomeward bound, and the most hazardous part of their work was done.\nThe captain, on coming to shore, would report a man lost, drowned, and\nhis body unrecovered. This drowned man, being an unknown, no relative\ncame forward to claim wages from the captain. How the man met his\ndeath was no secret among the dredgers, and they had to keep a wary\neye on their own lives; for a captain would often move the tiller so\nsuddenly as to knock a man overboard, accidentally, of course. A board\nof enquiry looked into these things, and a captain was tried for\nmurder, and escaped with a sentence of seven years' imprisonment.\nThere were not so many accidents after this, but they have not\naltogether ceased.\" After hearing this account, I was not very eager\nfor more practical knowledge of this profession, called dredging, so I\nagreed with Red to make three or four more trips as cattlemen, until\nthe spring of the year made other work easy to be obtained.\n\nWe returned to the office, where between thirty and forty men were\nwaiting an opportunity to ship. As I have said before, some of these\nmen were notorious beggars, and the kind-hearted people of Baltimore\nnever seemed to tire of giving them charity. One man, called Wee\nScotty, who had been a cattleman for a number of years, begged the\ntown so much in some of the rather long intervals when he was waiting\na ship, that he could take a stranger with him three times a day for a\nmonth, to be fed by the different good people that were known to him.\nHe could take up a position on a street corner, and say--\"Go to that\nhouse for breakfast; come back to this house for dinner, and yonder\nhouse with the red gate will provide you a good supper.\" In this way\nhe kept me going for two weeks when, at last, I was asked to sign\narticles to go with cattle to Glasgow.\n\nSome days before this, a man came to the office, whose peculiar\nbehaviour often drew my attention to him. He asked to be allowed to\nwork his passage to England, and the skipper promised him the first\nopportunity, and a sum of ten shillings on landing there. This was the\nreason why some of us had to wait so long, because, having made trips\nbefore, more or less, we required payment for our experience. The man\nreferred to above, had a white clean complexion, and his face seemed\nnever to have had use for a razor. Although small of body, and not\nseeming capable of much manual labour, his vitality of spirits seemed\noverflowing every minute of the day. He swaggered more than any man\npresent, and was continually smoking cigarettes--which he deftly\nrolled with his own delicate fingers. In the intervals between\nsmoking he chewed, squirting the juice in defiance of all laws of\ncleanliness. It was not unusual for him to sing a song, and his voice\nwas of surprising sweetness; not of great power, but the softest voice\nI have ever heard from a man, although his aim seemed to make it\nappear rough and loud, as though ashamed of its sweetness. It often\noccurred to me that this man was playing a part, and that all this\ncigarette smoking, chewing tobacco and swaggering, was a mere sham; an\naffectation for a purpose. I could not, after much watching,\ncomprehend. He was free of speech, was always ridiculing others, and\nswore like a trooper, yet no man seemed inclined to take advantage of\nhim. Blackey took him under his protection, laughing and inciting him\nto mischief. He was certainly not backward in insulting and\nthreatening Blackey, which made the latter laugh until the tears came\ninto his eyes. The men were spellbound at his volubility. He shook\nthat red rag of his, and a continuous flow of speech ensued, and the\nsurrounding creatures were mute, but not at all infuriated. His\naudacity may have slightly irritated one or two, but no man had the\nleast idea of inflicting on him corporal punishment. I and Red were\ncalled to the office to sign articles for Glasgow, and, when doing so,\nBlackey and this strange new companion of his were signing for\nEngland, the two ships leaving for their destination on the same tide.\nWe were sorry to lose this man's company, knowing that his tongue\nwould have gone far to amuse our leisure hours aboard.\n\nWe had a very pleasant voyage, and this line of boats gave us very\nlittle cause to complain, either of sleeping accommodation or diet,\nthe officers and ship's crew also being sociable in their dealings\nwith us. The same thing happened at the end of this voyage, and we\nwould have suffered the same privation--had it not been for an\naccident. On the fourth morning ashore there was not a penny among us,\nand the boat would not sail for another two days. Australian Red was\nrummaging his pockets and piling before him a large assortment of\nmiscellaneous articles. \"I wouldn't care much,\" said he, \"if I had the\npaltry price I paid for this,\" at the same time throwing on the table\na thick, heavy, white chain. Picking this up, for an indifferent\nexamination, I became interested, and enquired as to how it came into\nhis possession. It seemed that a poor fellow had offered to sell Red\nthe chain for a penny. Red, seeing the man's condition of extreme\nwant, had given him sixpence, at the same time refusing to accept the\nchain. The poor fellow had then persisted that Red should accept it as\na gift. Red, being now filled with his own troubles, wished that he\ncould dispose of the chain to the same advantage. The chain was,\nwithout doubt, silver, being stamped on every link. \"What!\" cried Red,\nsuddenly roused, while the cattlemen in their deep interest moved\nforward, making a circle several feet smaller--\"What!\" he cried,\n\"silver did you say? Let me see it!\" He snatched the chain and,\nwithout looking at it, or putting it in his pocket, rushed out of the\nroom without another word. In five minutes he returned, and throwing\ntowards me eight shillings, the value of the chain in pawn, said:\n\"None of this for drink; keep a tight hand on it for our food supply\nuntil the boat sails.\" He knew his own weakness. On first coming to\nshore I had taken the precaution to buy several books, to make sure of\nthem, indifferent whether we suffered hunger or no. For this reason I\nthoroughly enjoyed the voyage back, and we arrived safely at\nBaltimore, having been away a little over five weeks.\n\nThe first man we met, on entering the cattlemen's office, was Blackey,\nwho, having made a shorter trip, had returned some days previous.\n\"What became of your strange friend, Blackey?\" I asked. \"Did he remain\nin England, or return to America?\" \"Why, haven't you heard about it\nall?\" asked Blackey; \"the English papers were full of the case.\" \"We\nhave heard nothing,\" I said, thinking the poor fellow had either been\nkicked to death by one of the wild steers, or that he had either\nleaped at the waves in a mad fit of suicide, or that the waves had\nleaped at him and taken him off. \"He worked side by side with me for\neleven days,\" said Blackey, \"and by his singing, laughing and\ntalking, he made a play of labour. Down in the forecastle at night he\nsang songs and, in spite of our limited space, and the rolling of the\nship, he gave many a dance, and ended by falling into his low bunk\nexhausted, and laughing still. In all my experience this was the first\ntime that I was not eager to sight land, and fill myself with English\nale. On the eleventh day out, we were hoisting bales of hay for the\ncattle, and he was assisting me in the hold of the vessel. I know not\nwhether we failed to fasten properly the bales, or whether the\ncattlemen on deck blundered when receiving them, but all at once I\nheard a shout of--'Look out, below!' and down came a heavy bale,\nstriking my companion on the shoulder. He spun around once or twice,\nand then fell unconscious into my arms. The ship's doctor was at once\ncalled, and the poor fellow was taken aft. Several times a day I made\nenquiries about him, and heard that he was out of danger, but needed\nrest. I never saw him again. When we landed in England he was not to\nbe seen, and I thought, perhaps, that he was too ill to be removed\nwithout the assistance of a vehicle. Next day I happened to pick up a\npaper, in which was a full and lengthy account of how a woman had\nworked her way as a cattleman from the port of Baltimore, making\nmention of the ship's name. My companion was that woman, and I never\nhad the least suspicion,\" continued Blackey, \"although, I will say,\nthat I always thought him a queer man.\"\n\nI had scarcely been in the office a week, when I was offered a boat\nfor London. Only one two-pound man was required, all the others, with\nthe exception of one, who was to receive fifteen shillings, were\nten-shilling men. Red had no chance on this boat, and I was not sorry,\nknowing how his extravagant habits would spoil the trip's enjoyment.\nThis was a voyage of some delight, both aboard and ashore. Having been\nin London before, I knew what enjoyment could be had with but little\nexpense--of museums, parks, gardens, picture galleries, etc. I made\nfriends with a decent fellow, who had been a schoolmaster, and,\npersuading him out of Deptford, we procured lodgings in Southwark, and\nfrom that place we paid our visits to the different scenes. We saw\nnone of the other cattlemen until the hour of sailing. Many of the\npoor fellows had lost their money on the first night ashore, and now\nhad strange experiences to relate of workhouses, shelters,\nsoup-kitchens, and unsuccessful begging. When we arrived at Baltimore\nit wanted one week to Christmas Day, and there was not much chance to\nship again for two or three weeks, owing to the number of men waiting.\n\nAs I have said before, the people of Baltimore are extremely\nkind-hearted, and no man need starve if he has the courage to express\nhis wants. The women seem to be as beautiful as they are good, for I\nhave never seen finer women than those of Baltimore, and a man would\nnot be making the worst of life if he idled all day in a principal\nstreet, reading the face of beauty, and studying the grace of forms\nthat pass him by. But it is of their kindness and generosity that I\nwould now speak. For Christmas Eve had come, and Australian Red,\naccompanied by Blackey, had taken me on one side, the former beginning\nin this way: \"Will you join this night's expedition? What we want you\nto do is to carry a small bag, no more, and all the begging will be\ndone by us.\" I had visions of the police stopping me and enquiring the\ncontents of such a strange burden, but being an unsuccessful beggar,\nand feeling too independent to have others perform this office for me,\nwithout making some little effort to deserve their maintenance, I\nagreed to their proposal, and that evening at six p. m., we sallied\nforth together. They both started on a long street, Red taking one\nside and Blackey the other, whilst I waited the result some yards in\nadvance--a safe distance away. They could scarcely have been refused\nin one house, for in less than ten minutes they were both at my side,\ndropping paper parcels into the empty bag, the mouth of which I held\nopen. All at once Blackey disappeared, having been called in to\nsupper. The same thing happened to Red, two or three minutes after.\nWhen they approached me again with other parcels, they both agreed to\naccept no more invitations to supper, but that they would excuse\nthemselves as having families at home. They continued this for half an\nhour, hardly more, when the bag was full to the mouth. \"Now,\" said\nBlackey, \"take this to the office, and we will remain to fill our\npockets, after which we will follow as soon as possible. Or do you\nprefer to wait for us?\" I preferred to go, and, avoiding the main\nstreets and lighted places, succeeded in getting back without rousing\nthe curiosity of the police. They soon followed, with another supply\nstored in their capacious pockets. What delighted them most--but of\nwhich I took very little account, knowing to what use it would be\nput--was that they had received several small amounts in money, the\ntotal being one dollar and seventy-five cents. I shall never forget\nthis begging expedition. When the different parcels were unrolled, we\nbeheld everything that the most fastidious taste could desire, for not\none parcel, I believe, consisted of simple bread and butter, much less\nthe former by its own common self. There were fried oysters, turkey,\nchicken, beef, mutton, ham and sausages; Irish potatoes, sweet\npotatoes and yams; brown bread, white bread; pancakes, tarts, pie and\ncake of every description; bananas, apples, grapes and oranges;\nwinding up with a quantity of mixed nuts and a bag of sweets. Such\nwere the contents of over sixty parcels, got with such ease. Blackey\nhad been refused at three doors; and Red had failed at five, but had\nbeen requested to call back at two of them, and had not troubled to do\nso, not having properly located the houses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHIEVES\n\n\nCockney More was a cattleman, hailing from the port of Baltimore. He\nwas a born thief and, strange to say, nearly blind; but without doubt,\nhe was a feeler of the first magnitude. If he borrowed a needle, and\nthe said article was honestly returned, it behoved the lender, knowing\nthe borrower's thievish propensities, to carefully examine it\nto see that the eye had not been abstracted; for, as Donovan\nremarked--\"Cockney More could steal the milk out of one's tea.\"\n\nWhen I have looked at Cockney's long thin fingers, I have often\nwondered whether he had power to disjoint them at will, letting them\ndown the legs of his trousers to rummage the locality, while he stood\ninnocently talking to us with his hands in his pockets. That honour\nwhich is supposed to exist among thieves, was not known to Cockney\nMore, for he would rob his best friend, and do it in such a way that\nno man could take umbrage. For instance, six of us had landed in\nLiverpool, having been paid off that morning. Cockney, knowing the ins\nand outs of that city, and its numerous pitfalls for strangers,\nescorted us at once to a cheap lodging-house, where we paid in\nadvance for a week's bed, thus being assured of shelter until the ship\nwas ready to return. The next morning we sat six disconsolate men in\nthe lodging-house kitchen, not one of us having the price of his\nbreakfast. Cockney, being the last to rise, entered at last, and\nnoting our despondent looks enquired as to the cause. On being told he\nwent out and returned in a few moments with tea, sugar, bread and\nsausages. In fact, he continued these kind deeds during our week\nashore. The others, being mostly strangers, blessed him for a good\nfellow, but it occurred to me that he was simply returning us our own,\nfor he spent three times more money during those few days than he had\nreceived for the trip.\n\nI remembered a mean little trick that he had performed on one of the\ncattlemen that very first morning ashore. True, we were all getting\ndrunk fast, but I never thought Cockney would be daring enough to\nattempt such a deed in our first stage of intoxication. He had asked\nthis cattleman for a chew of tobacco and the man had generously\noffered him the whole plug to help himself. Cockney took this plug\nand, biting off a piece, returned the bitten part to the owner, and\nhimself pocketed the plug. I was speechless with astonishment at\nseeing this: and more so when the strange cattleman innocently\nreceived the bitten part, and put it in his pocket without having\nperceived anything wrong.\n\nCockney and myself were on the best of terms, and yet, some time\nprevious to the above episode, he had served me a trick which ought to\nhave severed our friendship for ever. I was at the shipping office and\nhad that morning signed for a trip to London. \"Have you sufficient\ntobacco, and a spoon, knife, fork and plate?\" enquired Cockney. \"Yes,\"\nI replied, \"and I have also a new pack of cards, so that we may enjoy\nour leisure hours aboard.\" Cockney was pleased to hear this, although\nhe was not to accompany me on this trip. \"Let me see them,\" said he.\nThis I did and being, as I have said, nearly blind, he took them to\nthe window for examination, but returned them almost immediately. Then\ncame a shout for all men who had signed for the London trip, and,\nhastily wishing Cockney and others good-bye, I left the office. On the\nsecond day out we were all at leisure for an hour or more, and\nenquiries went around as to who had a pack of cards. My cards were at\nonce produced and, taking partners, we were about to settle to a\nlittle enjoyment. Alas, when my cards were taken out of the new case,\nthey were found to be a dirty, greasy old pack with several missing,\nand, of course, card playing was out of the question. I at once knew\nwhat had happened: Cockney had substituted these old ones for the new,\nwhat time he pretended to be interested at the window. That little\ntrick meant twelve days' misery for eight men, for we could not get\nanother pack until we landed in London.\n\nOn that trip, when I had the pleasure of Cockney's company, we had\nwith us Donovan who, as a thief, certainly ran Cockney a good second.\nThe truth of the matter is that all cattlemen are thieves, and the one\nwho complains of going ashore without his razor, often has in his\npossession another's knife, comb or soap. On the second day out I\nmissed my pocket-knife and, without loss of time boldly accused\nCockney More to his face, telling him that however much I admired his\ndexterity in other people's pockets I had not the least suspicion that\nhe would be guilty of such a trick on an old pal. \"No more have I,\"\nsaid he. \"What kind of knife was it?\" On being told, he advised me to\nsay no more about it, and that he would endeavour to find it. He\nsucceeded in doing so, and the next day Donovan was shouting\nindignantly--\"Who has been to my bunk and stolen a knife?\" After this\nI lost my soap, but did not think it worth while mentioning such a\npetty loss. On approaching Cockney More for the loan of his,\nhe--giving me strict injunctions to return it at once, and not leave\nit exposed to the eyes of thieves--lent me my own soap.\n\nThis trip was a memorable one, and no doubt Cockney made the best haul\nof his life. We were together in Liverpool, Cockney, Donovan and\nmyself, and as usual drinking. A stranger, hearing by our\nconversation that we hailed from America, invited us to drink; and in\nthe course of conversation expressed a regret that he was out of work,\nand had no means of visiting America. \"Nothing is easier,\" said\nCockney, \"if you place yourself unreservedly in our hands. We are to\nsail on Thursday, and I can stow you away, as I have successfully done\nwith others.\" \"Many thanks,\" replied the other, and so it was agreed.\n\nOn the following Thursday we went aboard, the Cockney carrying a large\nbag which contained the stowaway's clothes, etc. When the ship's\nofficers entered our forecastle the stowaway was, of course, not\npresent, but when they were searching other places, the stowaway was\nthen sitting comfortably among us, these things being well managed by\nCockney More. After this search they would pay us no more visits, and\nthe stowaway was safe, and could go on deck at night for fresh air.\nThe only danger now was to land him in America. This, the Cockney\naffirmed, was a danger of little account.\n\nNow, as I have said, this stowaway had a bag, and Cockney More and\nDonovan were great thieves. Therefore, it was not at all surprising to\nhear that the poor fellow was soon without a second shirt to his back.\nHe had lent me a book, the value of which I did not think him capable\nof appreciating, and I had made up my mind that it should not be\nreturned until asked for. But when I heard him complain of losing so\nmany things, through pity I became honest and returned it. But where\nwas his watch and chain, his brushes, and where were his clothes, his\ntools, razor, strop, and many other useful articles? All these things\nwere in possession of Donovan, and Cockney knew it and appeared to be\ngrieving over lost chances; for he was supposed to have that honour\nwhich is among thieves, and as Donovan had been too fast for him, he\nhad no other option than to sit quiet under the circumstances.\n\nOn the day before our arrival at Baltimore, I happened to enter the\nforecastle and found Donovan, his face pale, feverously rummaging\nCockney More's bunk. \"What do you think?\" said he. \"That blasted\nCockney has robbed me of everything.\" And so he had. He had allowed\nDonovan to do all the dirty work, of abstracting the goods one by one,\nas the chance occurred; he had allowed him the pleasure of their care\nand possession for many days, and then he had robbed him. But the\nartful part of the business was this: he had not left Donovan any\nchance to recover the goods, for he had made friends with one of the\nsailors--the latter having a forecastle to themselves--and had\nprevailed on that person to take charge of a parcel for him until all\nthe cattlemen landed; \"for,\" said he, \"these cattlemen are born\nthieves.\" Yes, he had done the business neatly, for the desperate and\nmuch aggrieved Donovan who intended on landing to recover the goods\nby force, saw Cockney More walk ashore as empty-handed as himself, and\nhe was almost shaken in his belief that the said Cockney was, after\nall, the thief triumphant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE CANAL\n\n\nI now left Baltimore, travelling alone, making my way as fast as\npossible towards Chicago, where a canal was being built to facilitate\ncommerce between that large inland city, and deep water, at which\nplace I soon arrived.\n\nOn the banks of that canal were assembled the riff-raff of America and\nthe scum of Europe; men who wanted no steady employment, but to make\neasy and quick stakes--for the pay was good--so as to indulge in\nperiodical sprees, or in rare instances, for the more laudable purpose\nof placing themselves in a better position to apply for more\nrespectable employment. They came and went in gangs, for the work was\nso hard that there were few men that did not require a week's rest\nafter a month's labour. So much for the rough but honest working\nelement. But unfortunately these canal banks were infested by other\ngangs, who did not seek work, and yet were often to be seen loafing\nabout the various camps. Then how did these men live? For they could\nnot successfully beg, seeing that work was to be had for the asking.\nPerhaps the explanation is that seldom a day passed but what a dead\nbody was dragged out of the water, and more than two-thirds of these\nbodies bore the marks of murder. The bodies were not those of men\ncoming from the city in search of employment, but of such men as had\nbeen known to have quit work a few days previous, having then had a\nmonth's or more pay on their persons, and who had been on the way to\nthe city for enjoyment. Yes, these loafers were undoubtedly the thugs\nand murderers, and if a man was inclined to hazard his life, all he\nhad to do was to make it known that he on the following day was to\ndraw his earnings, with the intention of walking the canal banks to\none of the distant towns. It was hardly likely that he would reach his\ndestination, but would be taken out of the canal some days later--a\nmurdered man. To defeat the purpose of these unscrupulous life-takers,\nthe more timid workmen waited for one another until they were\nsufficiently strong in number to discharge themselves and travel\nwithout fear. But alas! there was many a man who prided himself on his\nown heart and muscles for protection and dared the journey alone. At\nthe time of which I write there had been no houses built on those\nbanks, therefore no women walked to and fro, and no children played\nthere. No doubt such are to be seen there at the present day, innocent\nof the violence and the blood that was shed there in the past.\n\nI had applied for work at one of these camps and being sickened of the\nsame in a little more than three weeks demanded my earnings at the\nsame time Cockney Tom and Pat Sheeny drew theirs, with the intention\nof accompanying them to Chicago. Being somewhat delayed in business,\nowing to the absence of the timekeeper, and being then compelled to\nremain for dinner, we soon saw the impossibility of reaching the city\nbefore midnight. Therefore it was arranged between us that we should\nsettle for the night at some place half way between the camp and the\ncity, and rise early so as to enter the latter before noon on the\nfollowing day. With this intention we started, after receiving dinner\nand pay, and after several hours' walk settled down.\n\nThere would be six hours' darkness and it was proposed that I should\nkeep awake for the first two hours' watch, after which Cockney Tom\nwould relieve me, and Pat would then keep watch until daybreak.\n\nNow, in my two hours' watch I had on several occasions heard a stir in\nthe adjoining bush, but not being able to see whether it was a man or\na beast, I had not thought it necessary to alarm my companions. At\nlast I considered my duty to be at an end, and, after rousing Cockney\nTom, settled myself for sleep. Before I closed my eyes I noticed that\nthe second watch was still lying recumbent, although he seemed to be\nwide awake; but I was too intent on my own sleep to care whether he\nwould be faithful to his trust or not. I don't think I could have been\nasleep more than fifteen minutes when I was startled by a loud shout\nand, springing to my feet was just in time to see Cockney Tom in\npursuit of one who was then entering the bush. The Irishman was also\nup, and we both followed the chase. We soon reached our companion,\nfinding him standing dazed and confused as to which way the quarry had\ngone. He explained to us that when on watch he was lying down with his\neyes closed, but with his ears wide open, and all his mental faculties\nat work. Suddenly, he heard a step near and opening his eyes saw a\nstranger standing within three feet of him. It was at that moment that\nhe gave the alarm, but the stranger was too fleet to be overtaken. \"No\ndoubt,\" said Cockney, \"there is a gang of them at no short distance\nfrom here and if we are wise, we will continue our journey at once. I\nhave seen the man's face before, at the camp, and know I shall\nrecognise him if we meet again.\" His advice of continuing our journey\nwas hardly necessary, for sleep was now out of the question.\n\nIn less than a week after the above incident we three, having\nsquandered our earnings in Chicago, were back at the old camp seeking\nre-employment. There happened to be only one vacancy, which the\nIrishman persuaded Cockney to accept, whilst we two would travel on to\nthe next camp, a distance of two miles. We were about to do this when\nthe boss ganger asked me if I would like a position in the boarding\nshanty as assistant cook. Knowing that an assistant cook meant no more\nthan carrying water, peeling potatoes, washing dishes, keeping a good\nfire and opening cans of condensed meat and preserves--I felt quite\nconfident in undertaking such a position. So the Cockney and I started\nto work at once, but before doing so, arranged for the keep of Pat\nuntil a vacancy occurred, his meals to be entered to our account. The\nnext morning his chance came and he was set to work.\n\nWe had been working four days, and on the evening of that fourth day\nwe three and a number of others were resting ourselves in a quiet\nplace near the camp. Whilst seated there, smoking and talking, there\ncame along four strangers, who seated themselves some distance from\nus, but within earshot of our conversation. No one paid much heed to\nthem, for it was not unusual to be visited by strangers in quest of\nwork. But there was one man who could not keep his eyes from them, and\nthat was Cockney Tom. \"Yes,\" he said to me after several long puffs at\nhis pipe, \"that stranger, showing us his side face, is the very man\nwho attempted to rob us.\" Saying this the Cockney took off his cap and\nlaying it carefully on the ground with its inside uppermost, placed\ntherein his dirty clay pipe, as gently as a woman putting a sleeping\nbabe in its cradle--and to the no small surprise of his companions\nbegan to address them in this oratorical fashion: \"Gentlemen, some\ntime ago a man attempted to rob me and two others, and ever since then\nI have been longing to meet him face to face. At last we meet, and I\nwould like to know what is to be done with him.\" \"Why, give him a good\nhiding, of course,\" cried several angry voices. On hearing this the\nCockney at once turned towards the strangers--whom he had hitherto\npretended not to notice--and in three bounds was standing over them.\nPlacing his hands on the shoulders of one he said in a calm voice,\n\"This is my man.\" The man referred to rose deliberately to his feet,\nas though he had expected this, and his companions did likewise.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"what is the trouble?\" \"You know quite well,\" replied\nthe Cockney, \"so you may as well strip without further question.\"\nWhatever the stranger was, he certainly was no coward, for his coat\nand waistcoat were soon in the hands of his companion. The Cockney\nlost no time, and the next minute they stood squaring before each\nother in such a scientific way as promised the onlookers a most\ninteresting exhibition. Although the stranger was the taller of the\ntwo, the Cockney seemed to possess the longer reach. Round after round\nthey fought, and in spite of their heavy and muddy boots the footwork\nwas neat, and the dodging of their heads, and the feinting of their\narms made the more gentle onlookers overlook the drawing of blood.\nThere was no wrestling, or mauling on the ground, and there was no\nattempt at foul blows, for each of the principals seemed to value the\nfavour of that most appreciative assembly. It looked more like a\nfriendly exhibition than two men attempting to take life. The\nspectators laughed approval and buzzed with admiration until even the\nbleeding men, hearing this, chaffed one another, and smiled at each\nother grimly with their battered faces. Yes, it seemed friendly enough\nuntil the tenth round when the Cockney, who the round previous seemed\nto show signs of weariness, called to his assistance some latent force\nwhich set his arms to work like a pair of axes on a tree, and down his\nopponent fell, and the battle was lost and won. The stranger was borne\naway by his companions, and Cockney Tom returned to the camp to dress\nhis injuries, which did not prevent him from work on the following\nday. The Cockney was well pleased with this exploit, and if his\nopponent was one of those thugs and murderers, who had taken an active\npart in perhaps fifty or sixty murders, he would certainly be lucky if\nhe never met with severer punishment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE HOUSE-BOAT\n\n\nI worked long enough on this canal to save fifty dollars, and then\nquit, feeling the old restlessness return, which had unsettled me for\nsome time. With this comfortable sum in my possession I kept beating\nmy way west until I arrived at St. Louis, a large city on the\nMississippi, having up till now lived frugally, and spent nothing on\ntravelling. This kind of life was often irksome to me, when I have\ncamped all night alone in the woods, beside a fire, when one good\nsociable companion might have turned the life into an ideal one. Often\nhave I waked in the night, or early morning, to find spaces opposite\noccupied by one or two strangers, who had seen the fire in the\ndistance, and had been guided to me by its light. One night, in\nIndiana, when it had rained heavily throughout the day, I had made my\nfire and camped under a thick leaved tree, where the ground was dryer\nthan in the open. Sometime about midnight, I felt myself roughly\nshaken, at the same time a sudden shower fell that pinned me\nbreathless to the earth. I looked here and there, but could see no\none. Then I left the shelter of the tree and saw to my surprise, that\nthe night was fine, and that the stars were thick and shining. As I\nreplenished the fire with wood, of which I always gathered in an\nabundance before darkness came, it puzzled me much to account for\nthis. Although I thought the shaking must have been a dream, my wet\nclothes were a sufficient proof of the rain's reality. Every man I met\non the following day enquired where I had lodged during the earthquake\nshock on the previous night, and that question explained everything.\nThe earth had shaken me, and the leaves of the tree, which had been\ngathering all day, the rain drops had in one moment relinquished them\nall upon my sleeping form.\n\nOn reaching St. Louis I still had something like forty dollars, and\nbeing tired of my own thoughts, which continually upbraided me for\nwasted time, resolved to seek some congenial fellowship, so that in\nlistening to other men's thoughts I might be rendered deaf to my own.\nI had bought a daily paper, and had gone to the levee, so that I might\nspend a few hours out of the sun, reading, and watching the traffic on\nthe river. Seeing before me a large pile of lumber, I hastened towards\nit, that I might enjoy its shady side. When I arrived I saw that the\nplace was already occupied by two strangers, one being a man of middle\nage, and the other a youth of gentlemanly appearance. Seating myself,\nI began to read, but soon had my attention drawn to their\nconversation. The young fellow, wanting to go home, and being in no\ngreat hurry, proposed buying a house-boat and floating leisurely down\nthe Mississippi to New Orleans, from which place he would then take\ntrain to Southern Texas, where his home was. \"We will go ashore,\" he\nsaid, \"and see the different towns, and take in fresh provisions as\nthey are needed.\" The elder of the two, who had a strong Scotch\naccent, allowed a little enthusiasm to ooze out of his dry\ntemperament, and agreed without much comment. \"Excuse me, gentlemen,\"\nI said, \"I could not help but hear your conversation and, if you have\nno objection, would like to share expenses and enjoy your company on\nsuch a trip.\" The Texan, being young and impetuous, without the least\nsuspicion of strangers, jumped to his feet, exulting at the social\nproject. Scotty, more calm, but with a shrewd eye to the financial\nside of the question, said that he thought the trip would certainly be\nenjoyed better by three, and that the expense would not be near so\ngreat per head. We had no difficulty in purchasing a house-boat.\nHundreds of these are moored to the banks, lived in by fishermen and\ntheir wives, and others in various ways employed on the river. But, of\ncourse, the one we required was to be much smaller than these. We\nfound one, at last, rather battered, and ill-conditioned, for which we\nwere asked eleven dollars. Scotty, to our unfeigned disgust, acted the\nJew in this matter of trade, and had succeeded in beating the price\ndown to nine dollars and a half when we to his annoyance offered to\npay that sum without more ado. But Scotty, although mean in these\nbusiness matters, was strictly honest and just in paying an equal\nshare; for, after I had paid the odd half a dollar, he did not forget\nthat amount when we came to stocking the boat with provisions. We lost\nno time in getting these, and then went ashore for the evening's\nenjoyment and the night's sleep, intending to start early the next\nmorning. And with these prospects before us, a very pleasant evening\nwe had.\n\nAt nine o'clock the following morning, we weighed anchor--our anchor\nbeing a large stone--and drifted into the current, the young Texan\nusing an oar as a tiller. And what a strange voyage we had, fraught\nwith more danger than many would dream. This Mississippi river often\nhad only a few yards for navigation purposes, even when the distance\nfrom bank to bank was between two and three miles. Sometimes we were\nin the middle of this broad river, and yet were in extreme danger of\nfloundering, for we could touch the bottom with a short stick. Yes, we\nwere in danger of floundering, and yet our ship drew less than six\ninches of water! Trees, whose branches were firmly embedded in the\nmud, had their roots bobbing up and down, bobbing up unawares, and we\nwere often in danger of being impaled on one of these ere we could\nsteer clear of it. Sometimes we would see villages and small towns\nthat in the remote past had been built flush on the banks of this\nriver: now they were lying quiet and neglected a mile or more away,\nowing to the river's determination to take his own course. Hundreds of\nlives had been sacrificed, dying of swamp fever, in building levees\nand high banks to prevent this, and millions of dollars utilised for\nthe same purpose--but the Father of Waters has hitherto had his own\nwill, and can be expected to be seen at any place, and at any time.\n\nTowards evening we would put ashore on a sand bar, making a fire with\nthe driftwood, of which there was an abundance. Here we cooked supper,\nslept and enjoyed breakfast the next morning. There was no other water\nto be had than that of the river, which the natives of the south claim\nto be healthy. We had no objection to using it for cooking and\nwashing, but it was certainly too thick for drinking cold--or rather\nlukewarm, for it was never cold in the summer months. We would fill a\nlarge can and let the water settle for twenty or thirty minutes, and,\nafter taking great care in drinking, a sediment of mud would be left\nat the bottom a quarter or three-eighths of an inch deep.\n\nWe put ashore at one place where a number of negroes and white men had\nassembled in expectation of work, when man again proposed putting\nforth his puny strength against the Mississippi, where we decided to\nwait a day or two and take our chance of being employed. Unfortunately\nthe ill feeling which invariably exists between these two colours came\nto a climax on the first day of our arrival. The negroes, insulting\nand arrogant, through their superiority of numbers, became at last\nunbearable. On which the white men, having that truer courage that\nscorned to count their own strength, assembled together, and after a\nfew moments' consultation, resolved to take advantage of the first\nprovocation. This came sooner than was expected. A negro, affecting to\nbe intoxicated, staggered against a white man, and was promptly\nknocked down for his trouble. The negroes, whose favourite weapon is\nthe razor, produced these useful blades from different parts of\nconcealment, stood irresolute, waiting for a leader, and then came\nforward in a body, led by a big swaggerer in bare feet, whose apparel\nconsisted of a red shirt and a pair of patched trousers held up by a\nsingle brace. These white men, who were so far outnumbered, said\nlittle, but the negroes were loud in their abuse. This soon led to\nblows and in the ensuing fight, knives, razors and fists were freely\nused. Only one shot was fired, and that one told. When the negroes,\nwhose courage had failed at such a determined resistance, were in full\nflight, the tall swaggerer was left behind with a bullet in his heart.\nSeveral men were wounded, with gashes on necks, arms, and different\nparts of the body. Small fights continued throughout the day, but it\nwas left for the night to produce a deed of foul murder. A white man\nwas found next morning with his body covered with blood from\nthirty-nine wounds. Half a dozen razors must have set to work on him\nin the dark. The razor is a sly, ugly-looking weapon, but is far less\ndangerous than a knife, a poker, or even a short heavy piece of wood;\nand as it cannot pierce to the heart or brain, that is why this man\ntook so long in the killing. This deed roused the sheriff and his\nmarshal, and they followed the black murderers to the adjoining state,\nbut returned next day without them.\n\nWe embarked again, but owing to the young Texan being taken sick with\nmalarial fever, resolved to put ashore for medicine at the first large\ntown. This malarial fever is very prevalent in these parts, especially\nthis state of Arkansas, which is three parts a swamp. He suffered so\nmuch that we decided to call on the first house-boat seen, and ask\nassistance of the fishermen, and soon we had an opportunity of doing\nso. Seeing a large house-boat moored at the mouth of a small creek, we\nput the tiller--which as I have said, was an oar--to its proper work,\nand sculled towards the shore. We ran to land within ten yards of the\nother boat, and the fisherman, who had seen us coming, stood waiting\non the sands to know our wants. He was a typical swamp man, with a\ndark sickly complexion, thin-faced and dry-skinned and, though he was\nnearly six feet in height, his weight, I believe, could not have\nexceeded one hundred and twenty pounds. His left cheek was\nconsiderably swollen, which I thought must be due to neuralgia until\nthe swelling began to disappear from that side; and, after witnessing\nfor a few seconds a frightful, even painful contortion of the face, I\nsaw the right cheek come into possession of the same beautiful round\ncurve, leaving the left cheek as its fellow had been. It was now\napparent that the one object of this man's life was to chew tobacco.\nTo him we related our troubles, asking his advice, and for a little\ntemporary assistance, for which he would be paid. Up to the present\ntime he had not opened his lips, except a right or left corner to\nsquirt tobacco juice, sending an equal share to the north and south.\n\"I guess there's some quinine in the shanty boat,\" he said, after a\nlong silence, \"which I reckon will relieve him considerably, but he\nought ter go home ter th' women folk, that's straight.\" He led the way\nto his boat, and we followed. We soon had the young Texan in comfort,\nand Scotty and myself returned to transfer some provisions to the\nfisherman's house-boat, for the evening's use. While doing so, we\ndecided to sell our own boat, at any price, when we would walk to the\nnearest railroad, and send the young fellow home; after which we\nwould seek some employment and settle down. We cooked supper, and then\nslept in the open air, beside a large fire, leaving our sick friend\ncomfortable in the boat.\n\nThe next morning we offered our house-boat for sale for six dollars,\nwith all its belongings. The fisherman explained to us that he not\nonly had no money, but rarely had use for it. Everything he needed he\npaid for in fish, and often went months at a time without a glimpse of\nmoney of any description. To my surprise the one thing that did seem\nto claim his attention, for which he could not help but display some\ngreed, was the large stone which we had brought with us from St.\nLouis, and which we had used for anchor. This stone certainly had no\nvein of gold or silver in it, it was not granite or marble, and could\nboast of no beauty, being a very ordinary looking stone indeed, but it\nseemed to have a strange fascination for this man. The fisherman had\nno money, and had nothing to barter which might be of use to us, so we\nmade him a present of the whole lot, and left him sitting on the\nstone, watching our departure. \"He seemed very eager to possess that\nstone,\" I remarked to Scotty, as we followed a trail through a\nthicket, so that we might reach the high-road. \"Yes,\" said Scotty,\n\"for in this part of the country, where there is little but sand, wood\nand mud, a stone, a piece of iron, or any small thing of weight, can\nbe put to many uses.\"\n\nAfter reaching the road we had twenty miles to walk to reach the\nnearest railway station, at which place we arrived late that night,\nthe young Texan being then weak and exhausted. A train was leaving at\nmidnight for New Orleans, and, after seeing him safely aboard, we sat\nin the station till daybreak. Early the next morning we were examining\nthe town, waiting for business to start, so that we might enquire as\nto its prospects for work. This seemed to be good, there being a large\nstave factory which employed a number of men. We succeeded in our\nquest, starting to work that morning, and at dinner time received a\nnote of introduction to an hotel. That evening we associated with our\nfellow-workmen, and, in the course of conversation, we discovered that\nthere was no particular time to receive wages, there being no regular\npay day. Sometimes wages ran on for a month, six weeks, two months,\netc. At the present time no man had received wages for over two\nmonths. \"Of course,\" he explained to us, \"anything you require you can\neasily get an order for on the stores.\" We worked two weeks at this\nfactory, when I was taken ill myself with malaria, and not being able\nto eat, soon became too weak for work. In this condition I went to the\noffice for my money, but could not get it, and saw that nothing else\ncould be done than to get an order on the stores, and take my wages\nout in clothes, shoes, etc. Scotty was scared at this, and quitted\nwork at once to demand his wages in cash, and there I left him,\nwaiting for a settlement. I intended going to Memphis, the nearest\nlarge town, and placing myself in its hospital, whilst Scotty was\ngoing to New Orleans, where I promised to meet him in a month,\nproviding I was sufficiently recovered to do so.\n\nI don't know what possessed me to walk out of this town, instead of\ntaking a train, but this I did, to my regret. For I became too weak to\nmove, and, coming to a large swamp, I left the railroad and crawled\ninto it, and for three days and the same number of nights, lay there\nwithout energy to continue my journey. Wild hungry hogs were there,\nwho approached dangerously near, but ran snorting away when my body\nmoved. A score or more of buzzards had perched waiting on the branches\nabove me, and I knew that the place was teeming with snakes. I\nsuffered from a terrible thirst, and drank of the swamp-pools,\nstagnant water that was full of germs, and had the colours of the\nrainbow, one dose of which would have poisoned some men to death. When\nthe chill was upon me, I crawled into the hot sun, and lay there\nshivering with the cold; and when the hot fever possessed me, I\ncrawled back into the shade. Not a morsel to eat for four days, and\nvery little for several days previous. I could see the trains pass\nthis way and that, but had not the strength to call. Most of the\ntrains whistled, and I knew that they stopped either for water or\ncoal within a mile of where I lay. Knowing this to be the case, and\ncertain that it would be death to remain longer in this deadly swamp,\nI managed to reach the railroad track, and succeeded in reaching the\nnext station, where most of these trains stopped. The distance had\nbeen less than a mile, but it had taken me two hours to accomplish. I\nthen paid my way from this station, being in a hurry to reach Memphis,\nthinking my life was at its close. When I reached that town, I took a\nconveyance from the station to the hospital. At that place my\ncondition was considered to be very serious, but the doctor always\nbore me in mind, for we were both of the same nationality, and to\nthat, I believe, I owe my speedy recovery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA LYNCHING\n\n\nUpon leaving the hospital, I remained several days in Memphis,\nspending most of my hours enjoying the shade and sunshine of a small\npark, which is pleasantly situated in the main portion of that town.\nOne morning, while doing this, I was accosted by one whom I soon\nrecognised as a fellow worker of mine in the stave factory. From him I\nlearnt that the firm had smashed, no pay day had come, and the stores\nhad all absolutely refused to honour the firm's orders; while some men\nhad left the town disgusted, and others were patiently waiting a\nsettlement that would never come. This man was going north, so I left\nhim at Memphis, intending to beat my way to New Orleans, and from that\ntown to the state of Texas.\n\nThese states of Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, are\nthe homes of the negroes of old. It is a strange contrast to see the\nold negroes, who in their young days were slaves, reverently raising\ntheir hats to any seedy looking white man whom they meet, calling him\nsuch titles as captain, major, colonel and even general--and the half\ndefiant gloom of the free, young generations, who are still in some\nrespects slaves to the white men. These negroes lived in small wooden\nshanties, and rarely received money for their labour. They worked for\nthe planter at so much a day. This gentleman kept on the plantation a\nlarge general store, and supplied their wants at such an exorbitant\nprice that the negroes were seldom out of debt, when the busy season\ncommenced. In the cities, silk would be far cheaper than the common\nflimsy muslin which poor black Dinah so much coveted from her master's\nstore. I have heard many an old negro say that he was far worse off as\na freeman than as a slave.\n\nThe prisons in the north were like hotels, but here in the south went\nto the extreme of cruelty. In some places a man would be tried and\nperhaps fined ten dollars and costs. A citizen, having need of a cheap\nlabourer, would pay this fine, take possession of the prisoner, and\nmake him work out his fine on the farm. This citizen would buy the\nprisoner cheap overalls, dungarees, shirts, shoes, etc., for a few\ndollars, and charge the prisoner four times their amount. The prisoner\nwas not free to refuse these, and being forced to work out their\nprice, was kept in this way twice the number of his days. I was very\nmuch afraid of all this, although a wandering white man was not in\nnearly so much danger as a negro.\n\nSome days after leaving Memphis, I arrived at a small town, where I\nwas surprised to see an unusual amount of bustle, the surrounding\ncountry for miles having sent in all its able bodied men. Every man\nwas armed with a gun, and they stood in small groups talking outside\nthe various stores. It seemed as though there had been rumours of an\ninvasion, and that these men were organising to defend their homes and\ncountry, but I had not the least idea of what had really happened. The\nsmall groups now began to join together into larger ones, and the\nlarger groups joined until they became one large body of men. This one\nbody then shouldered guns and moved quickly along the main street, the\nmen's faces being drawn and pale. I followed on, perhaps the one\nunarmed man among them, curious to know the meaning of it all. They\ncame at last to a halt, and, to see the reason for this, I stepped\nacross the way, and saw that they had halted before a large building,\nwhich, by its barred windows, I had no difficulty in recognising as\nthe jail. One man had curled around his shoulders a long rope, and\nthis man with two others knocked loudly with the butt ends of their\nguns on the prison door. Almost in an instant the door was flung wide\nopen, and the sheriff stood in the open way to know their wants. The\nmen must have demanded the prison keys, for I saw the sheriff at once\nproduce them, which he handed to these men without the least show of\nresistance. This man with the rope and several others then entered\nthe jail, and the silent crowd without cast their eyes in that\ndirection. Up to the present time I had not heard a distinct voice,\nnothing but the buzz of low whispering. But suddenly from the jail's\ninterior there came a loud shriek and a voice crying for mercy. Men\nnow appeared in the open doorway, dragging after them a negro at the\nend of a rope. This unfortunate wretch was possessed of a terror that\nis seldom seen in a human being. He fell on his knees to pray, but was\njerked to his feet ere he could murmur the first words, O Lord. He\nstaggered to and fro and sideways, at the same time howling and\njabbering, foaming at the mouth, and showing the horrible white of his\neyes. I can well understand a man screaming, trembling and crying for\nmercy, when actually enduring bodily pain, but that one should show\nsuch a terror at the thought of it, filled me more with disgust than\npity. That this prisoner should have been so brutal and unfeeling in\ninflicting pain on another, and should now show so much cowardice in\nanticipation of receiving punishment inadequate to his offence, dried\nin me the milk of human kindness, and banished my first thoughts,\nwhich had been to escape this horrible scene without witnessing its\nend. For it was now I remembered reading of this man's offence, and it\nwas of the most brutal kind, being much like the work of a wild beast.\nThey now marched him from the jail, their strong arms supporting his\nterror stricken limbs, but no man reviled him with his tongue, and I\nsaw no cowardly hand strike him. Soon they came to a group of trees on\nthe outskirts of the town, and, choosing the largest of these, they\nthrew the rope's end over its strongest branch, the prisoner at the\nsame time crying for mercy, and trying to throw his body full on the\nground. When this was done a dozen hands caught the rope's end, made\none quick jerk, and the prisoner's body was struggling in the air.\nThen all these men shouldered their guns, fired one volley, and in a\nsecond the body was hanging lifeless with a hundred shots. In five\nminutes after this, nothing but the corpse remained to tell of what\nhad occurred, the men having quietly scattered towards their homes.\n\nA few days after this, I was in New Orleans, intending to spend a week\nor two in that city, before I started on my journey to Texas. It was\nin this city, three days after my arrival, that I became the victim of\nan outrage which was as unsatisfactory to others as to myself. Having\nbeen to the theatre, and being on my way back home late at night, half\na dozen men, whom I scarcely had time to recognise as negroes, sprang\nfrom a dark corner, and, without saying a word, or giving the least\nchance of escape or defence, biffed and banged at my face and head\nuntil I fell unconscious at their feet. Their motive, without a doubt,\nwas robbery, but having my money concealed in a belt next to my body,\nthey had to be satisfied with a five cent piece, which was all my\npockets contained. Such brutal outrages as these are seldom committed\nby white men, who having the more cool courage, demand a man's money\nat the commencement, and do not resort to violence, except it be their\nvictim's wish. But this not very intelligent race half murder a man\nwithout being sure of anything for their pains. White men will search\na man as he stands, and if he possesses nothing, he may go his way\nuninjured, followed perhaps, by a curse or two of disappointment; but\nthese negroes prefer to murder a man first, and then to search the\ndead body. They are certainly born thieves. On the river boats, that\nply the Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans, which are all\nmanned by negroes, with the exception of those holding the higher\noffices, a negro thief will often spoil a six dollar pair of trousers\nin robbing his victim of a twenty-five cent piece. When a man is\nasleep the negro will bend over him, feeling the outside of his\ntrousers where the pockets are. If he feels the shape of a coin,\ninstead of working his fingers carefully into the mouth of the pocket,\nhe takes out his razor and, holding the coin with the fingers of his\nleft hand, cuts it out, bringing away coin, part of the lining, pocket\nand trousers. When the victim wakes he, or some one else, sees the\nhole, and they at once know the meaning of it. I remember a trip on\none of these boats when a white man feigned a sleep, lying on his\nback on a bale of cotton, with his hands in his coat pockets. In his\nright pocket was a revolver, which his right hand held ready cocked\nfor use. These negroes are always on the look out for sleepers, and\none of these thieves was soon bending over his expected victim. He had\nfelt a coin and, taking out his razor, was in the act of cutting it\nout, when there was a sharp report, and the negro fell back shot\nthrough the brain. The supposed sleeper quietly rose to his feet, and\nwhen the captain and some officers came, he simply pointed to the\nnegro and the fallen razor, and no other explanation was needed. At\nthe next stopping place the captain had a few words with the\nauthorities, and the dead body was taken ashore, but the white\npassenger continued his journey without being bothered about a trial\nor examination. There was no more thieving during that trip.\n\nI soon left New Orleans, being possessed with a restless spirit, and,\nafter visiting Galveston, Euston, and many more towns of less\nimportance, I made my way through the heart of Texas to the town of\nParis, which lies on the borders of the Indian territory. It was in a\nsaloon in the main street of this town that I had my attention drawn\nto a glass case, wherein was seen hanging a cord, at the end of which\nwas something that looked very much like a walnut. On looking closer,\nI saw a small heap of dust at the bottom. Seeing that this case\ncontained no stuffed animal, nor any model of ingenious mechanism, I\nbegan to read the printed matter, curious for an explanation. This\nsmall thing dangling at the end of the cord purported to be the heart\nof a negro, whom the people had some time previously burned at the\nstake. He had suffered a terrible death: so had his little victim, a\nmere child of a few years, who had been found in the woods torn limb\nfrom limb. This negro had been arrested by the sheriff, and sentenced\nto a short term adequate to his offence. After he had been released,\nhe had taken his revenge on the sheriff's child, bearing her off when\non her way to school. The sheriff's wife, being the child's mother,\nhad with her own hand applied the torch to this monster, and if her\nhand had failed, any woman in this land of many millions would have\nwillingly done her this service.\n\nI left Paris that night, catching a fast cattle train, and arrived the\nfollowing morning at Fort Smith, Arkansas. Bill Cook, the train and\nbank robber, and his gang, were being tried this morning, and a\nspecial train was now waiting to convey them to the penitentiary. I\nsaw this notorious free-booter, when he was brought to the station--a\nyoung man between twenty and thirty years, receiving a sentence of\nforty years' imprisonment. One of his gang, Cherokee Bill, a\ndesperado of nineteen years, was indicted for murder, and remained in\nFort Smith to be hanged. The train steamed out with its many deputies\nto guard a few prisoners--few, but proved to be very dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE CAMP\n\n\nWho would have dreamt that so many well known beggars would have met\ntogether at one camp, without any prearranged plans? The time was\nmorning and the scene was on the outskirts of Pittsburg, and the\ncharacters were Philadelphia Slim and Wee Shorty, who had all night\nridden the freight car and had now dismounted near the camp, which\nthey knew of old. They both had cold victuals in plenty, with dry\ncoffee and sugar, and they were not long in making a blaze and\nfetching water from the spring before they were seated comfortably to\ntheir breakfast, after which they intended to sleep, for they were\nmore weary than working men.\n\nThey were not without money; for Wee Shorty and Slim had, the day\nprevious, been encamped with others about a hundred miles from the\npresent spot, at which place there had come to the camp an unfortunate\nblacksmith who possessed society papers but lacked courage to beg with\nthem. On which Wee Shorty had conceived a most daring plan, which was\nto borrow the aforesaid papers, with the blacksmith's consent, and to\nmake his way to the nearest blacksmith's shop. With this idea in his\nmind the Wee Man had bound his hand in white linen, so that he could\nplead disablement in case the blacksmith doubted him to be the\nlegitimate owner of the papers, and to prove his veracity, would test\nhim with a little job. After binding his hand in this way, Wee Shorty,\nwho was no more than five feet in height, and who had small white\nhands and a pale face, and whose weight never exceeded seven stone and\na half, and who looked more like a sickly tailor than a\nblacksmith--after taking this precaution, Wee Shorty made his way to\nthe blacksmith's shop. In less than twenty minutes he had returned\nwith a dollar in small change, and had returned the poor blacksmith\nhis papers, and generously given him one-fourth of his makings. Yes,\nit would indeed be a hard town if this wee fellow failed to make\nmoney.\n\nAs I have already said, Slim and the artful one were tired after their\nnight's ride, and they were well pleased to find the camp unoccupied\nby strangers. But they had scarcely made their coffee and swallowed\nthe first mouthful, when the dried twigs were heard to crack beneath a\nheavy tread and, the next moment, there walked into the camp the\nIndian Kid, whom the present proprietors had not seen for over twelve\nmonths.\n\nWhat a meeting was there, and what confidences were exchanged. There\nwas good reason for the Kid not having been seen, for he had been\nincarcerated in a jail. He had committed his first and last burglary,\nwhich had not been done with an eye to profit, but out of a mean\nspirit of revenge. He had been refused charity at a house and, on\nleaving the place, had spied a small outhouse in which he saw many\nthings easy to carry, and easily to be converted into money. Bearing\nthis in mind he had returned after dark, scaled the back wall, and was\nsoon in possession of a large bundle consisting of shirts, frocks,\nshoes and various carpenter's tools. All this had been done through a\nspirit of revenge, for the Kid swore that he could have begged the\nworth of the bundle in half an hour. Being in possession of that\nbundle at that strange hour of the night, he was afraid to carry it\ninto the town for fear that the police would enquire his business, so\nhe hid it in the bushes, which in the night looked so dark and thick;\nafter which he had artfully walked some distance away, and laid\nhimself down to sleep until morning. It must have been daylight for\nseveral hours when the Kid rose hastily and went in quest of his\nbundle. But the bundle had disappeared, and the Kid had been cruelly\nrobbed, by early workmen he at first thought, who had spied the bundle\nin the bushes, which appeared so much less heavy by day than by night.\nHowever it was not the early workman who had done this, but a plain\nclothes policeman who still hid behind the bushes and, seeing the Kid\nsearching for his bundle, sprang from concealment, saying--\"You are\nlooking for a bundle, and I am looking for you.\" Such was the Kid's\nstory, recited at great pains, for he often rambled in his discourse\nto laud himself as a successful beggar who would, on no account,\ncommit burglary for profit; all of which accounted for his twelve\nmonths' disappearance.\n\nHis story was scarcely at an end when who should walk into the camp\nbut Windy, the talkative Windy, whose tongue had entertained many a\ncamp with strange and unique experiences. Of course, at his heels was\nPennsylvania Dutch, a faithful friend enough but a poor beggar, who\nwas no more than a pensioner on Windy's bounty, and acted the part of\na man-servant.\n\nBut there was another surprise to follow; for English Harry, who had\nbeen in Pittsburg for some time past, having now walked out of the\ncity to take a glance at the camp, walked into it at this very time,\nand to his astonishment and joy found the place in possession of good\nbeggars instead of common work seekers, as he had at first feared.\n\nOnly imagine all these notorious men meeting together haphazard in\nthis manner. They could scarcely recover their astonishment. There was\nnothing else to be done but to make a muster of what money was in the\ncamp, and to send Pennsylvania Dutch for its worth in whisky, so as to\ncelebrate such an event by a carousal. This was at once done, and\nWindy's pensioner shook off his laziness from head to foot, which made\nWee Shorty sarcastically remark--\"Dutchy would rather buy than beg.\"\nTo which Windy, in a voice of despair, answered--\"He will never make a\nbeggar and, if I did not keep a sharp eye on him, or anything occurred\nto part us, he would live in orchards and turnip fields until he saw a\nchance to become a working man. He confessed, when I first met him,\nthat he had lived for ten days on green corn and apples, so I took him\nin hand and kept him, thinking my example would rouse him to action,\nbut it was of no use, for the poor fellow has not the heart. However,\nI never forget poor Dutchy when I am foraging,\" said Windy, rather\ntenderly.\n\nIt was not long before the object of these remarks returned and placed\nbefore his companions two bottles of whisky. \"Now, boys,\" said Windy,\nafter he had become affected by several lots of spirits--\"Now, boys, I\npropose that we hold this camp down for a whole week, and we will all\nrag up\"--meaning that they would beg clothes and put on the appearance\nof gentlemen. His proposal was unanimously seconded, and was quickly\nfollowed by a suggestion from the Indian Kid that they should finish\nthe whisky, which also met with no objection. \"We will hold the camp,\"\ncried Windy, \"against all comers.\" They would certainly find no\nnecessity for defending their privacy, for one glance at these six\nmen, especially in their present condition, would have been sufficient\nto deter any decent-minded person from entering. This camp was now far\nmore private than Mrs. Brown's house in town, who had a neighbour that\nnever entered other people's doors without first knocking; but which\nneighbour never gave Mrs. Brown, or any one else, the chance to remove\nsundry things that were better concealed, nor waited to hear the cry\n\"come in\"; for she entered as she knocked, saying--\"Don't be alarmed,\nMrs. Brown, it is only Mrs. White.\"\n\nAlas, the whisky soon gave out, and there was no more money, and what\nwas to be done? \"I propose,\" said English Harry, \"that we leave\nPennsylvania Dutch in charge of the camp while we go out foraging for\nan hour.\" To this they all agreed, and made their way towards the\ntown. On reaching the suburbs they divided and went in different\ndirections, with the understanding that each man should be returned to\nthe camp in less than two hours, and that each one should have no less\nthan half a dollar.\n\nHow it was done was a mystery, but Wee Shorty was back in less than an\nhour, not only with half a dollar but with twenty cents' worth of\nwhisky in a bottle. He was soon followed by Windy, who had begged\nfifty-five cents. After which came in English Harry and the Indian Kid\ntogether, each with half a dollar. But where was Philadelphia Slim,\nWee Shorty's boon companion? For these were good beggars all, who\ncould have almost persuaded the birds to feed them in the wilderness,\nand Slim was by no means the worst, even though the Wee Man was by a\nsmall degree the best. Until they knew the fate of poor Slim they felt\nvery little inclination to continue their carousal.\n\nIt might have been three-quarters of an hour after the return of\nEnglish Harry and the Kid, when they heard a step coming through the\nbush and, turning their eyes that way, were soon confronted by their\nlate companion Slim. He had a large bundle under his arm, but to the\nsurprise and anxiety of his companions, was holding to his nose a\nblood-stained pocket handkerchief. \"Who has done that, Slim?\" cried\nWee Shorty, who had surreptitiously fortified himself with whisky, and\nwho, being the smallest man, was naturally the most ferocious--\"Who\nhas done that?\" he cried, springing to his feet and, with his hands\ndangerously clenched, standing to his full height. Slim did not answer\nthis question at once, but threw down his bundle; after which he\nproduced a dollar bill and placed it thereon. Pointing then to the\ntwain with his right hand--his left hand still being occupied with his\nbleeding nose--he said, \"Here is a suit of clothes and a dollar bill,\nand I have well earned them.\" Such words were mysterious to his\nassociates, for they knew that Slim would never at any price perform\nlabour, and they came to the conclusion in their own minds that he had\nforcibly taken these things in a very high handed fashion, and had\nsuffered in the act. What a disgrace to the profession!\n\nAfter enquiring if there was any whisky to be had, and being supplied\nwith the same by his particular friend Wee Shorty, Slim proposed that\nPennsylvania Dutch should be again despatched with all speed for a\nfresh supply. Seeing this done he then seated himself and proceeded to\ngive his experience.\n\nIt seems that Slim had had more difficulty than was expected. A full\nhalf hour had elapsed, and Slim had not received one cent, although he\nhad told his pitiful story to a number of people. He almost began to\ndespair of success, but firmly resolved not to return without\nsomething to show for his trouble. Seeing a very large house he went\nto the front door and rang the bell, but the door remained unanswered.\nNot to be baffled by this, and beginning to feel desperate, he made\nhis way to the back of the house, and was just about to knock at the\nback door when a voice hailed him from an adjoining shed. Turning his\neyes in that direction he saw a man in his white shirt sleeves, who\nseemed to be the master of the house. Now, as Slim looked across, he\nsaw into the shed, and behold there was a punching ball hanging from\nthe ceiling, which was still moving as though this gentleman had only\nthat moment finished practising. On Slim explaining his wants, which\nhad been increasing in number through his ill-success, the gentleman\nquietly went to a shelf and taking therefrom a pair of boxing gloves\ntold Slim that if he would oblige him with ten minutes' practice with\nthe same, he would reward him with a dollar. Now it happened that\nthese things were not entirely unknown to Slim, and once or twice in\nhis life he had actually had them in his hands--but not on--and he had\ncome to the conclusion that they could do but very little hurt.\nTherefore he donned the gloves, being as eager to earn an easy dollar\nas the master of the house was eager to practise. Alas! it was this\ndifference in their motives which gave the gentleman an overwhelming\nvictory and poor Slim a bloody nose and such aching bones. \"For,\" said\nSlim to us, \"suppose I had knocked him out, who was to pay me my\ndollar'? He attacked me like a mad bull, and all I dare do was to act\non the defence. Several times he left an opening which, had I taken\nadvantage of, would have ended in his collapse; and if he had died,\nthere had been no witness to hear what bargain had been made between\nus. Being at such a disadvantage as I was,\" Slim continued, \"he would,\nno doubt, have made matters worse if my nose had not bled, which I\nbegan to wipe with the gloves. Seeing this he was afraid my blood\nwould be conveyed by means of gloves to his own person, so he asked me\nif I had had enough. I thanked him that I had and, as we made our way\ntowards the house, told him I would be thankful for any old clothes to\nreplace my own, which were now stained with blood. He seemed to be so\npleased at having drawn my blood that I believe he would have given me\nanything I asked for. Here are the clothes, but I don't know what they\nare like.\"\n\nSuch was Slim's experience. On an inspection of the bundle it was\nfound to contain a clean shirt, a pair of socks, two handkerchiefs,\nand an almost brand new suit of clothes.\n\nJust as Philadelphia Slim ended his story, Pennsylvania Dutch returned\nwith the whisky, and we all caroused until sleep overpowered us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nHOME\n\n\nI had now been in the United States of America something like five\nyears, working here and there as the inclination seized me, which, I\nmust confess was not often. I was certainly getting some enjoyment out\nof life, but now and then the waste of time appalled me, for I still\nhad a conviction that I was born to a different life. The knowledge\nthat I had the advantage over the majority of strangers in that\ncountry, often consoled me when feeling depressed. For my old\ngrandmother had left me one-third profit of a small estate, my share\nat that time amounting to ten shillings per week, and during these\nfive years I had not drawn one penny, therefore having over a hundred\npounds entered to my account. So, when one would say how much he\ndesired to return to his native land, but had no means of doing so, I\nwould then explain how it could easily be done on the cattle boats.\nAnd if he protested, saying that he had not the courage to return\npenniless after so many years abroad, although I had no answer to\nconsole him, his objection was a pleasant reminder of my own\nexpectations. It was this knowledge that made me so idle and so\nindifferent to saving; and it was this small income that has been, and\nis in a commercial sense, the ruin of my life.\n\nIt was now the end of October, and I was in Chicago squandering a\nsummer's earnings, having, during the previous months, worked on a\nfruit farm in Illinois. I had been idling for three weeks, visiting\nthe various theatres at night, and reading during the day. One Sunday,\nI had bought a weekly paper, wherein I read an appreciation of the\npoet Burns, with numerous quotations from his work. My thoughts\nwandered back to the past, the ambition of my early days, and the\nencouraging words of my elders.\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, with a sigh, \"if during these five years I had had the\ndaily companionship of good books, instead of all this restless\nwandering to and fro in a strange land, my mind, at the present hour,\nmight be capable of some little achievement of its own.\"\n\nThese thoughts haunted me all day, and that night a great joy came\nover me; for after my thoughts had tugged and pulled at my heart, all\npointing in the one direction, which I saw was towards England, I\nsettled with myself to follow them to that place. So, that night, I\nresolved to leave Chicago early the following day, beat my way to\nBaltimore, work a cattle boat to either Liverpool or London, and from\none of these places make my way back to where I belonged. With this\nobject, I was up early the next morning, had breakfast, and in as\nhappy a mood as when I first landed in America, left Chicago for the\nlast time.\n\nThe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was an easy road to beat. I had taken\nwith me a good lunch, with a small flask of whisky, so that I might\nattend to travelling for twenty or thirty hours without suffering\nthirst or hunger. At the end of thirty-six hours I got off a train,\nnow being hungry and thirsty, at a small town, having by then\ntraversed half the distance between Chicago and Baltimore. Without\nstaying any length of time in Pittsburg, I caught a train for\nConnesville, and, arriving there in a few hours, had to dismount and\nwait the next train for Cumberland, in the State of Maryland. A train\nwas now being made up, consisting of flat cars loaded with iron rails,\nand coal cars, also loaded. There was not much necessity on this road\nof concealing oneself, so I boldly mounted a coal car, and there I\nsat, exposed to the elements, and to the curious gaze of people at the\nvarious small towns through which we passed. What surprised me not a\nlittle was that I seemed to be the only man that was beating his way\non this train, whereas, this being such an easy road, most trains had\na number of tramps, some of them having two score or more. It did not\ntake me long to notice that these people at the different stations\nand villages stared at me with something like awe, had pale faces,\npointed at me in an unusual manner and whispered to each other. Now,\nbetween Connesville and Cumberland, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad\ncrosses the Allegheny mountains, and often the train, if heavy, can\nscarcely crawl up, after which it runs down at a terrific speed. We\nhad just mounted a steep elevation, had reached the top, and the train\nmen were making fast their brakes for the steep incline on the other\nside of the mountain, when my attention was drawn to a large number of\npeople assembled in the valley below, some distance ahead. I then saw\nthat the mountain side was covered with coal, and between forty and\nfifty trucks lay in a heap at the foot of the mountain. This train had\napparently, through some cause or another, jumped the rails, and the\ncars had rolled over and over from top to bottom. When I reached\nCumberland, still being stared at, and pointed out at the various\nstations and villages on the way, it was not long before an\nexplanation was forthcoming. I, it seemed, had followed a train that\nhad killed forty-four men--two brakesmen, the engineer, conductor, and\nforty tramps who were beating their way. On coming down the mountain\nside, the brakes had refused to work, the fireman had jumped off in\ntime to save his own life, and the others had all been precipitated\nwith the train into the valley and killed. It had run with such a\nreckless speed that it could not possibly maintain its hold of the\nrails. And this accounted for my being the one traveller on this\ntrain, and how horror-stricken the people had seemed at my temerity,\nwhich, of course, was no more than ignorance of the mishap. After this\nride I never again felt comfortable on a train, much preferring to\ntake my chance on the water, however stormy it might be. It made me\npause when this same night an unknown man was struck down by a fast\nexpress train, mangled and cut into pieces. Two or three trains left\nthis town of Cumberland before I could summon sufficient courage to\nride. I was standing, still wondering whether I should ride or walk\nfrom this town to Baltimore, when a switchman, who had just helped\nfinish making ready a train, said--\"Hello, lad; which way are you\ngoing, to Baltimore?\" On answering in the affirmative, he said,\npointing to this train, \"Jump on: you will be there early in the\nmorning!\" Which I did, at the same time saying to myself, \"This is my\nlast train ride in America, whether I live or die.\" No sleep that\nnight, and I was not sorry to reach Baltimore.\n\nI had something like fifty dollars at this time, and intended to go at\nonce to the cattleman's office, and to ship at the first opportunity,\nso that I might still have a few pounds left when I landed in England.\nSo, when I reached Baltimore, I soon made my way to that place, and\non entering, recognised several of the old cattlemen, among whom was\nno less a person than Australian Red, who it seemed had lost all\nambition for a more respectable life. I invited him out, with two\nothers, and we had several drinks, and at night visited the theatre.\n\"Now,\" I said, after leaving the theatre, well knowing that these men\nwould unscrupulously bleed me to the last cent, and would take\na cunning delight in robbing me and bearing all expenses\nthemselves--\"now,\" I said, \"one drink more, and we have reached the\nend of my resources.\"\n\nShipping, Red explained to me on the following day, was rather slow\nfor experienced hands. He had been begging Baltimore for more than six\nweeks, and was still without prospect of making a trip. He explained\nthat he could go at any time for a pound, and had had a chance or two\nto go for thirty shillings, but very few two-pound men had been called\nfor during the last three months. \"Are you going out for breakfast?\"\nhe asked. \"If you have any more money left, don't be foolish enough to\nspend it on food, for I can get you more than you want of that, and\nthe money can be used for pleasure.\" \"You already know that I have no\nmore money,\" I said to him, feeling myself change colour with guilt,\nwhich he did not notice. \"Wait here till I return,\" he said. \"If you\ndon't feel inclined to beg, for a day or two, you need have no fear of\nstarving.\" He then left me, and, after he had gone, I followed, and\nfeeling guilty and ashamed, turned into a restaurant for breakfast.\nLater on, when I returned to the office, Red was waiting for me with\nan abundance of food, for he had made extra exertion on this\nparticular morning. \"Come,\" he said, \"you must be hungry by this\ntime.\" Knowing that I had this part to keep up, I sat down, but after\nslowly eating a morsel or two, which had been difficult to swallow, I\nfound it necessary to plead a full stomach. Red was persistent, and so\ndissatisfied at this that I could not help but feel grateful for such\nkindness, and, feeling more shame than ever at playing such a part, I\narose, telling him I would wait for him outside the office. He soon\nfollowed, and, leading the way to another part of the city, I\ncommenced with him a spree that ended in a week's debauchery. Both of\nus then being penniless, we returned to the cattleman's office, to\nfind that a good chance had been lost in our absence, when the shipper\nhad enquired for us.\n\n\"What,\" cried Red, \"go home for good next trip, eh? Why, you are\ncursed, like myself, by restlessness, and, mark me, you will not\nremain six months in your native town.\" \"Perhaps not,\" I said, \"but I\nassure you, that neither this town, nor this country, shall again feel\nmy tread!\"\n\nSome days after this I was sent with several others to rope cattle at\nthe yards, and there met a foreman under whom I had made a former\ntrip. \"Hallo,\" said he, \"I have not seen you for some time; are you\ngoing with this lot of cattle?\" \"I don't know,\" was my answer, \"but I\nshould certainly like to, if there is need of a two-pound man.\"\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I'll put in a good word for you at the office.\" That\nnight the shipping master approached me on the subject. \"Look here,\"\nhe said, \"I can only give you thirty shillings for this trip. If you\nlike to wait, you can have two pounds, but I warn you, the chance may\nbe a long time coming. What do you say?\" \"I'll sign for thirty\nshillings,\" I said, with difficulty trying to conceal my eagerness;\nwhich was at once done. I was alone on this trip, among strangers. Had\nAustralian Red accompanied me, no doubt I should have spent my train\nfare, and been forced to return to America on the same boat.\n\nWhat an enjoyable trip this was from beginning to end! What music\nheard in the weighing of the anchor, and what a delightful sensation\nwhen the good ship moved slowly from her dock! I performed my duty\nwith a new pleasure, leaping here and there at any sign of danger,\ngiving one steer longer or shorter rope, as the case required, knowing\nwhat pleasant dreams would be mine at night, when the day's work was\ndone. And when this pleasant time came, I would lie in my bunk and\ntake an inventory of all the old familiar things which had been\nstored in my memory, unthought of for over five years, and nothing\nwould now escape me. I had written home only three times during this\nlong absence, three short letters in my first year abroad. Probably\nthey had given me up for dead, and I would appear at their door as a\nvisitant from another world. One thought often troubled me, and that\nwas to be going home without money, after such a long stay in a new\ncountry. For every man thinks that fortunes are more easily made in\nother lands than his own, and I knew that people would expect me to be\nin possession of ranches, flourishing towns and gold mines; and I felt\nmuch shame in having to admit that I had returned poorer than ever.\nHad it not been for the money saved during my absence, which had not\nbeen convenient for use, this thought had been likely to prevent my\nreturn for some years longer, perhaps for my whole life. On the tenth\nday we were passing Ireland, on which I gazed with deep feeling,\ntaking her to my heart as a sister isle, knowing at the same time that\nher heart was her distressful own. When I reached Liverpool, and the\ncattle had gone ashore, I received my pay, and, slipping away from the\nother cattlemen, went alone up town, made a few purchases in the way\nof clothes, and arrived at the railway station with three shillings\nand a few coppers over my fare. With this insignificant amount, the\nresult of five years in a rich country, and something like one\nhundred and twenty pounds standing to my account, I arrived that\nevening at my native town.\n\nHere I wandered lost for several hours, making enquiries for my\npeople, who, during my stay abroad, had moved from the place I knew. I\nhad just made up my mind to seek a favourite aunt of mine, who,\nprevious to my leaving England, had been a number of years in one\nhouse, and did not then seem likely to leave, when a strange woman in\nthe street where I was making enquiries, recognised me by my likeness\nto mother, and at once directed me to her place. I knocked on the door\nand mother, who always was and is full of premonitions, and is very\nsuperstitious in the way of signs and dreams, opened the door at once,\nknew who I was in the dark, though we could not see much of each\nother's form or face, and, to my surprise, called me by name. \"That's\nme, mother,\" I said. \"Yes,\" she answered, \"I thought it was your\nknock,\" just as though I had only been out for an evening's stroll.\nShe said in the course of the evening, that they had all given me up\nfor dead, except herself, and that she had also, three years before,\ngiven up all hopes of seeing me again, having had a dream wherein she\nsaw me beat about the head and lying bloody at the feet of strangers.\nShe mentioned the year, and even the month of this year, and a little\nconsideration on my part placed its date with that of the outrage at\nNew Orleans, but I did not then trouble her with an account of this.\n\nWhen I was very small an aunt took me to live with her for a couple or\nmore months in a small town in Gloucestershire, a county in which\nmother had never been. But she had a dream in which she saw me leaving\nthe house with my uncle's dinner, and that I had to follow the canal\nbank to his works. She saw me returning that same way, and, beginning\nto play near the water, fall in head first, she, in her dream, just\nreaching the spot in time to save me. Early the following morning,\nafter this dream, mother came by train to this village, walked the\ncanal bank to my aunt's house, without enquiring its whereabouts, and\ndemanded her son before he was drowned. There was certainly a\npossibility of this happening, for I was very small at that time, and\nthe canal was deep. She had never before been in this place, but the\nlocality seemed to be well-known to her as it was seen in her sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nOFF AGAIN\n\n\nOf course at this homecoming I vowed that I would never again leave my\nnative town. True, I found great difficulty in sleeping on a soft bed,\nand lay awake several hours through the night, tossing and turning\nfrom one side to another. The food itself did not seem so palatable\ncoming out of clean pots and shining ovens, as that which was cooked\nin close contact with the embers, and in the smoke and blaze of a camp\nfire. The unplucked chicken, covered with a thick crust of mud and\nbaked under a pile of hot ashes, after which the hard crust could be\nbroken to show the chicken inside as clean as a new born babe, with\nall its feathers and down stuck hard in the mud--this meat to me was\nfar more tasty than that one at home, that was plucked and gutted with\ncare, and roasted or baked to a supposed nicety. This food of\ncivilisation certainly seemed to suffer from a lack of good wholesome\ndirt, and I should like to have had my own wood fire at the end of the\nbackyard, were it not for shame.\n\nFor several weeks I walked the streets, renewing old acquaintance,\naccosted here and there by my old school-mates. Most of them were\nmarried, but married or single, they all seemed to be poor and\nunsuccessful. I began to drink immoderately at this time, meeting one\nand the other, and very soon began to realise that my hundred and\ntwenty pounds were going at the rate of a sovereign a day. Scarcely\nhad I been home one month, when, to escape from so much drink, I made\na trip to Bordeaux, on one of the local steamers. But it was of no\nuse: for I saw the time coming when I would again be without\nprospects. I had not worked at my trade since leaving Bristol, six\nyears before, and had no intention of doing so again. The fever of\nrestlessness that had governed me in the past, broke out afresh, and\nafter two months of this idle life, I suddenly made a pretence of\nbeing filled with a desire for business, saying it was my intention to\nopen a bookshop in London, and as soon as possible, which I have often\nhad thoughts of doing. With this end in view, I drew the remainder of\nmy money, which in two months had dwindled by a half, divided a few\npounds among the family, and took train for London. \"Yes,\" I repeated\nto myself, several times on this journey. \"I will open a bookshop and\nsettle down to a quiet life of study, for which there will be ample\ntime during the intervals of business.\" In London I saw a number of\nvacant shops that would have answered the purpose, but unfortunately,\nI had not the least notion of how or where to obtain books, the\ngreater part of which were to be second-hand. If, when on this quest,\nI could have bought a bookshop ready fitted and filled, no doubt I\nwould have closed with the offer at once, and settled quietly down.\nNot seeing any way out of this difficulty, I continued my rambles\nthrough the city, day after day, invariably visiting the theatre at\nnight. This happened for over a week, and the money was still going\nout and none coming in, and poverty never appeared worse to me than at\nthat time.\n\nOne afternoon, when passing through Trafalgar Square, I bought an\nearly edition of an evening paper, and the first paragraph that met my\neye had this very attractive heading--\"A Land of Gold.\" It was a\ndescription of the Klondyke, and a glowing account of the many good\nfortunes that daily fell to the lot of hardy adventurers. It would\ncost me sixty pounds, or more, to travel to that remote part of the\nworld, and forty-four pounds were all I now possessed. This thought\ndid not for long discourage me from making the attempt. I knew that I\ncould beat my way across the Canadian continent, without using a cent\nfor travelling, and I could save these few pounds for food, and cases\nin which payment would be absolutely necessary, when forced to travel\non foot, at the other end of Canada.\n\nThat night I exchanged thirty pounds for their equivalent in paper\ndollars, placing the latter in a belt which I wore next to my skin,\ndetermined that this money should not see the light until my journey\nwas nearly done.\n\nIt was now the month of March, and the navigation of the St. Lawrence\nhad not yet opened, so that I would be compelled to beat my way from\nHalifax, or St. John's, to Montreal, which would not be necessary\nlater in the Spring, when the latter port would be the destination of\nall emigrant ships. I was very happy at this time, with these\nprospects in view, which were really too bright to decoy any man who\nhad an average amount of common-sense. My conception of that wonderful\nland, for all my travels, was childish in the extreme. I thought the\nrocks were of solid gold, which so dazzled the sun that he could not\nconcentrate his glance on any particular part, and that his eye went\nswimming all day in a haze. I pictured men in possession of caves\nsitting helpless in the midst of accumulated nuggets, puzzled as to\nhow to convey all this wealth to the marts of civilisation. What I\nwanted with all these riches I cannot say, for it was never a desire\nof mine to possess jewellery, fine raiment, yachts, castles or horses:\nall I desired was a small house of my own, and leisure for study. In\nfact I made up my mind not to waste time in hoarding more wealth than\nwould be necessary to these small comforts, but to return home\nsatisfied with a sum not exceeding two thousand pounds, the interest\nfrom which would, I thought, be ample for any student who remained\ntrue to his aims, and was sincere in his love for literature.\n\nIn this month of March, the first day in the second week, I left\nEuston Station at midnight, and arrived cold and shaking in Liverpool,\nearly the next morning. On making enquiries, I learnt that a ship was\nleaving for St. John's on the following Wednesday, from which place\nemigrants must needs go by train to Quebec or Montreal, owing to the\nice-bound condition of the river. I decided on making St. John's my\ndestination, from which port I would beat my way towards the west,\ngoing easy at first, and faster as the spring of the year advanced.\n\nThe accommodation for steerage passengers on this ship was abominable,\nand their comfort seemed to be not in the least considered. This was\nowing to the small number of English speaking people that were\ntravelling as steerage passengers, and the disgusting, filthy habits\nof the great majority, who were a low class of Jews and peasantry from\nthe interior of Russia. None of the ship's crews could be expected to\ntreat these people as one of themselves, seeing them sit to eat in the\nfilth of their skin and fur clothes, without the least thought of\nwashing; and again, hiding food in their bed clothes, making the cabin\ntoo foul to sleep in. After seeing the first meal fought for, and\nscrambled for on the steerage floor, where it had fallen, we\nEnglishmen, five in number, took possession of a small table to\nourselves, only allowing one other, a Frenchman, to sit with us. This\ndid not succeed without some protest. On the second day out, when we\nwent below for our mid-day meal, we found the table to be already\noccupied by these people, who maintained our seats, looking defiantly\nat us to show that they had taken no accidental possession of the\nsame. It was owing to these defiant looks that we determined to\nre-possess this table. \"Stick close together,\" said a young\nEnglishman, who was a blacksmith, with the accredited brawny arms.\nSaying which he caught one of the usurpers in his arms, and with great\nforce threw him in the midst of his people, knocking several of them\ndown. There was great commotion at this. Two hundred of these haters\nof soap and water began to jabber and wildly gesticulate, and no doubt\nevery foul word in that unknown tongue was used against us. Instead of\nseating ourselves at once at the table, which was now unoccupied, we\nstood in our small body waiting with a quiet determination which did\nnot seem at all to their relish. This attitude conquered them; and, as\nnone of us were quarrelsome, and did not again in any way interfere\nwith them, either on deck or below, the trip was ended without any\nfurther trouble.\n\nSo many of these aliens were landing in Canada at this time, that when\nI approached the Custom House officers, one of them, judging by my\nfeatures and complexion, which were not much unlike those of a native\nof the south, addressed me in an unknown tongue. I looked at him in\nsurprise, which made him repeat his question, probably in another\ntongue, equally unknown. Being rather incensed at this, and flushing\nindignantly at this tone to a dog, I lost no time in answering him\naccording to Billingsgate. \"Ho, ho!\" he laughed, \"so you are a\nblooming cockney, and so am I. Why didn't you say so at once?\"\n\nThe blacksmith had booked through to Quebec, and would take train to\nthat place before morning. Three other Englishmen had booked through\nto Winnipeg, and would travel with him by the same train. The other\nEnglishman, a carpenter by trade, had relatives in Montreal, and,\nhaving only a couple of dollars in his possession, was willing to take\ninstructions from me how to get there. I promised to get this man to\nMontreal in three or four days, providing he did not at any time\nquestion my actions. He kept his promise and I kept mine, for on the\nfourth day after landing, I wished him good-bye outside his sister's\nhouse, which he had had some difficulty in finding. I was now alone,\nand seeking a companion for my journey west.\n\nNow, once upon a time, there lived a man known by the name of Joe\nBeef, who kept a saloon in Montreal, supplying his customers with a\ngood free lunch all day, and a hot beef stew being the midday dish.\nThere was not a tramp throughout the length and breadth of the North\nAmerican Continent, who had not heard of this and a goodly number had\nat one time or another patronised his establishment. Often had I heard\nof this famous hostelry for the poor and needy, and the flavour of its\nstew discussed by old travellers in the far States of the South. When\nI thought of this, I knew that a companion for any part of America\ncould most certainly be found on this man's premises, and I would\nthere hear much valuable information as to the road I was about to\ntravel. So I went strolling along quietly, intending to wait until I\nmet some needy looking individual before I made enquiries. Now,\nwhenever Joe Beef's name had been mentioned it had invariably led to\nthe mention of French Marie, and the name of the latter as invariably\nintroduced the name of Joe Beef, for these two establishments seemed\nto be patronised by the same class. These names were well-known to me,\nfor, as I have said, their fame was abroad throughout America.\n\nI was strolling along with these thoughts, when I met the man of my\ndesire, leaning lazily against a post. Not wishing to accost him\noutright, and yet eager for his conversation, I stood beside him\nlighting my pipe, striking several matches for this purpose and\nfailing, owing to the wind blowing in small gusts. Seeing my dilemma,\nthe man quickly produced matches of his own, and striking one, held it\nlighted between the palms of his hands, leaving just enough space for\nthe bowl of my pipe to enter. For this I thanked him, and secondly,\ninvited him to a drink, asking him where we should go, being in hopes\nhe would mention Joe Beef. \"Well,\" he answered, pointing to the\nopposite corner, \"the nearest place is French Marie's.\" We entered\nthat place and, in the course of conversation, I told him how I had\nbeat my way from state to state, but that this was my first experience\nin Canada. \"The United States,\" said this man sagely, \"are nearly\nplayed out, and of late years there are far too many travellers there.\nYou will find the Canadian roads better to beat, and the people's\nhearts easier to impress, for they are not overrun. When did you get\nhere?\" Knowing that this man was under the impression that I had just\nbeat my way into Canada from the States, and not willing to undeceive\nhim, I answered quickly \"This morning,\" and for a time changed the\nconversation into a praise of the beer. \"Where are you going to\nsleep?\" he asked. \"Meet me here in half an hour, after I have begged\nthe price of my bed, and a drink or two--and we will both go to Joe\nBeef's, where I have been for this last week.\" Not wishing to lose\nsight of this man, I told him that my pocket could maintain the two of\nus until the next day. \"All right,\" said he, appearing much relieved,\n\"we will go at once and settle for our beds, and come out for an hour\nor so this evening.\" Leaving French Marie's we walked beside the river\nfor some distance, when my companion halted before a building, which I\nknew must be Joe Beef's, having just seen two seedy looking travellers\nentering. We followed, and to my surprise, I saw it was a rather clean\nlooking restaurant with several long tables, with seats and a long bar\non which the food was served. But what surprised me most was to see a\nnumber of Salvation Army men and officers in charge of this place.\nWithout saying a word to my companion, I took a seat at one of the\ntables, to order a beef stew, asking him what he would have, and, for\nhis sake, the order was doubled. \"When Joe Beef kept this place,\"\nwhispered my companion, \"he was a true friend to travellers, but you\ndon't get much out of these people except you pay for it!\" Although I\nwinked at him, as though the same thoughts were mine, I noticed that\nthe meals were well worth what was charged for them, and, in after\ndays, I often compared this place favourably with similar institutions\nin London, that were under the same management, and where men did not\nget the worth of their money.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA VOICE IN THE DARK\n\n\nAt this place I remained several weeks, watching the smiling Spring,\nwhich had already taken possession of the air and made the skies\nblue--unloosing the icy fingers of Winter, which still held the earth\ndown under a thick cover of snow. What a glorious time of the year is\nthis! With the warm sun travelling through serene skies, the air clear\nand fresh above you, which instils new blood in the body, making one\ndefiantly tramp the earth, kicking the snows aside in the scorn of\naction. The cheeks glow with health, the lips smile, and there is no\ncareworn face seen, save they come out of the house of sickness of\ndeath. And that lean spectre, called Hunger, has never been known to\nappear in these parts. If it was for one moment supposed that such a\nspectre possessed a house in this country, kind hearts would at once\nstorm the place with such an abundance of good things that the\nspectre's victim would need to exert great care and power of will, if\nhe would not succumb to an overloaded stomach. This spectre is often\nseen in the overcrowded cities of Europe, and one of its favourite\nhaunts is the Thames Embankment, in front of the fine hotels where\nambassadors and millionaires dine sumptuously. Where they sit or stand\nat their windows watching the many lights of the city, and to see the\nmoon dipping her silver pitcher in the dark river, and they swear, by\nJove! it is worth seeing. But they cannot see this spectre of Hunger,\nmoving slowly, and sometimes painfully, from shadow to shadow,\nshivering and anxious for the sun, for they have no other fire to sit\nbefore, to make their dreams of the past pleasant.\n\nI remained three weeks in this inexpensive hotel, and decided to\ntravel on the following Monday, although the snow was still deep in\nMontreal, and would be yet deeper in the country. I had a small room\nfor sleeping purposes, at a cost of fifteen cents per night. There\nwere several others of the same kind, each divided one from the other\nby a thin wooden partition, which was high enough for privacy, but did\nnot prevent curious lodgers from standing tip toe on their beds, and\npeering into another's room. Going to bed early on Sunday night,\nprevious to continuing my journey on the following day, I was somewhat\nstartled on entering my room, to hear a gentle rap on the partition\nwhich divided my room from the next. \"Hallo!\" I cried, \"what do you\nwant?\" The man's wants, it seemed, were private, for he seemed\nfrightened into silence at this loud tone of demand, which would most\ncertainly draw the attention of others. At last he cleared his throat\nby a forced fit of coughing, and then whispered, in a low distinct\nvoice--\"I want a match, if you can oblige me with one.\" Of course,\nsmoking was not allowed in the bed-rooms, but in this respect we were\nnearly all breakers of the law. Taking a few matches from my pocket, I\nthrew them over the partition, and heard him feeling in the\nsemi-darkness, after hearing the sound of them falling. Then he gently\nstruck one, and, by its light, gathered in the others. In a moment or\ntwo he addressed me in his natural voice, and, to my surprise, it\nsounded familiar, and filled me with curiosity to see this man's face.\nI encouraged him to talk--which he seemed determined to do--thinking a\nword might reveal him to me, and the circumstances under which we had\nmet.\n\nHis voice in the dark puzzled me, and I could not for my life locate\nit. A hundred scenes passed through my memory, some of them containing\na number of characters. In my fancy I made them all speak to me,\nbefore dismissing them again to the dim regions from which they had\nbeen summoned, but not one of their voices corresponded with this\nvoice heard in the dark. Above this voice I placed thin and thick\nmoustaches, black, grey, brown, red, and white; under this voice I put\nheavy and light beards of various hues, and still, out of all my\nmaterial, failed to make a familiar face. Still sending Memory forth\nin quest of the owner of this voice, and she, poor thing! bringing\nforward smiling men and stern men, thin men and fat men, short men and\ntall men, tame men and wild men, hairy men and bald men, dark men and\nfair men--until she became so confused as to bring back the same\npeople the second time; still sending her forth on this vain quest, I\nfell asleep.\n\nIt was a dreamless sleep; no sound broke its stillness, and no face\nlooked into its depths; and, when I awoke the next morning, this voice\nseemed to be already in possession of my thoughts. I lay awake for\nabout ten minutes, and was just on the point of rising, thinking the\nman had left his chamber, when I heard a stir coming from that\ndirection. He was now dressing. Following his example, but with more\nhaste, so as to be the first ready, I waited the unbolting of his\ndoor, so that I might meet this man face to face. I unbolted my own\ndoor, and opened it when I was but half dressed, but there was no\nnecessity for doing this, for my arms were in the sleeves of my coat\nwhen his bolt was slipped back, and we simultaneously appeared, at the\nsame time wishing each other good morning. I recognised this man\nwithout difficulty, but apparently had the advantage of him. To make\nno mistake, I looked at his right hand, and saw the two fingers\nmissing, knowing him for a certainty to be Three Fingered Jack, who\nhad been a cattleman from Montreal, whom I had met in Glasgow when I\nhad gone there from Baltimore, three years previous to this. On that\noccasion I had been in this man's company for only half an hour, and\nsince that time had heard thousands of voices, but was still positive\nthat I had heard this voice before.\n\nWe stood side by side washing, and preparing for breakfast, and,\nalthough I remained a stranger to him, as far as former acquaintance\nwas concerned, I mentioned to him in confidence that I was going west\nthat very morning, after breakfast. \"So was I,\" he said, \"as far as\nWinnipeg, but thought to wait until some of this snow cleared. Anyhow,\nas a day or two makes little difference, we will, if you are\nagreeable, start together this morning. I know the country well,\" he\ncontinued, \"between Montreal and Winnipeg, having travelled it a\nnumber of times, and, I promise you, nothing shall be wanting on the\nway.\"\n\nThis man had lost his two fingers at work in the cotton mills, some\nten years before, and ever since then had been living in idleness,\nwith the exception of two or three trips he had made as a cattleman.\nCertainly he lived well on the kindness of these people, as any able\nbodied man might do in this country, without being in any way\nafflicted. Though he was going to Winnipeg, he was in no hurry, had no\nobject in view, and had not the least idea of where that town would\nlead him, and he soon tired of one place.\n\nThree Fingered Jack was a slow traveller for, as he with some emotion\nsaid--\"It broke his heart to hurry and pass through good towns whose\ninhabitants were all the happier for being called on by needy men.\"\nThis slow travelling suited me for the time being, for we were having\nanother fall of snow, and I half regretted having left Montreal,\nalthough, day after day I was certainly getting a little nearer to the\ngold of Klondyke. But I determined to shake off this slow companion on\nthe first approach of fine weather.\n\nWe loafed all day in the different railway stations, in each of which\nwas kept a warm comfortable room for the convenience of passengers.\nAlthough we were passengers of another sort, and stole rides on the\ntrains without a fraction of payment to the company, we boldly made\nourselves at home in these places, being mistaken for respectable\ntravellers, who were enjoying the comforts for which we paid.\nSometimes a station master would look hard on us, suspecting us for\nwhat we were, but he was very diffident about risking a question,\nhowever much he was displeased at seeing us in comfortable possession\nof the seats nearest to the stoves. Towards evening we made\napplication for lodgings at the local jail, at which place we would be\naccommodated until the following morning. I was now without money,\nwith the exception of that which was concealed and reserved for the\nmost hazardous part of the journey, which would be its western end.\nNow, in all these jails we were searched and examined before being\nadmitted for a night's shelter, but often in a very indifferent\nmanner. One night we arrived at a small town where a double hanging\nwas to take place in the yard of the jail early the next morning. A\nwoman, it seems, had called on her lover to assist in the murder of\nher husband, which had been brutally done with an axe, for which crime\nboth had been pronounced guilty and condemned to die. Thousands of\npeople had flocked in from the neighbouring country, which in this\nprovince of Ontario was thickly settled, and a large number of plain\nclothes detectives had been dispatched from the cities, there being\nsupposed some attempt might be made at rescue, owing to one of the\ncondemned being a woman. We arrived at this town early in the\nafternoon, and were surprised at the unusual bustle and the many\ngroups of people assembled in the main thoroughfares. Thinking the\ntown contained, or expected, some attraction in the way of a circus or\nmenagerie, we expressed little curiosity, but returned at once to the\nrailway station, intending to possess its most comfortable seats\nagainst all comers, until the approach of darkness, when we would then\nmake application at the jail for our night's accommodation. When this\ntime came, we marched straight to the jail, and boldly hammered its\ndoor for admittance. It was at once answered by a police officer, to\nwhom we explained our wants, and he, without much ado, invited us\nindoors. Expecting the usual questions, and being prepared with the\nusual answers--expecting the usual indifferent search, and having\npipe, tobacco and matches artfully concealed in our stockings--we were\nsomewhat taken by surprise to find a large number of officers, who all\nseemed to show an uncommon interest in our appearance. The officer,\nwho was examining us previous to making us comfortable for the night,\nhad finished this part of the business to his own satisfaction, when\none of these detectives stepped forward, and said--\"We cannot admit\nstrangers to the jail on the present occasion, so that you had better\nmake them out an order for the hotel.\" This order was then given to\nus, and we immediately left the jail; and it was then, curious to know\nthe reason for this action, that we soon made ourselves acquainted\nwith the true facts of the case. When we arrived at the hotel, we were\ninformed that every bed had been taken since morning, and that, as it\nwas, a number of men would be compelled to sit all night dozing in\ntheir chairs, and it was with this information that we returned to the\njail. For the second time we were admitted, and were advised to walk\nto the next town. This, Three Fingered Jack absolutely refused to do,\nsaying that his feet were too blistered and sore to carry him another\nhundred yards. All these detectives then got together, and, after a\nrather lengthy consultation, one of them came forward and, after\nplying us with a number of questions, proceeded to examine our\nclothes, and that so thoroughly that I feared for the result. At the\nbeginning of the search, I gave him my razor, a small penknife, my\npocket-handkerchief and a comb, but he was not satisfied until his\nhands were down in my stockings, and bringing up first my pipe, then\nmy tobacco, and lastly the matches. What worried me most was the belt\nnext to my body, which contained my money. I had not much fear of\nThree Fingered Jack, when confronting each other openly, though he was\na tall active man, but had he known of these dollars, I had not dared\nin his presence to have closed my eyes, believing that he would have\nbattered out my brains with a stone, wooden stake or iron bar, so that\nhe might possess himself of this amount. This detective certainly\ndiscovered the belt, and felt it carefully, but the money being in\npaper, and no coin or hard substance being therein, he apparently was\nnone the wiser for its contents. At last this severe examination was\nat an end, and we were both led through an iron corridor and placed in\na cell, the door of which was carefully locked. I don't believe we\nslept one moment during that night but what we were overlooked by a\npair, or several pairs of shrewd eyes. They could not believe but\nthat we were other to what we pretended, and had come there with\ndesigns to thwart the ends of justice. Next morning our things were\nreturned to us, and we were turned adrift at a cold hour that was far\nearlier than on ordinary occasions.\n\nThe snow was still deep and the mornings and evenings cold when, a\nweek after this, we reached Ottawa. This slow travelling was not at\nall to my liking, and I often persuaded my companion to make more\nhaste towards Winnipeg. This he agreed to do; so the next morning we\njumped a freight train, determined to hold it for the whole day.\nUnfortunately it was simply a local train, and being very slow, having\nto stop on the way at every insignificant little station, we left it,\nat a town called Renfrew, intending that night to beat a fast overland\npassenger train, which would convey us four or five hundred miles\nbefore daybreak. With this object we sat in the station's waiting-room\nuntil evening, and then, some twenty minutes before the train became\ndue, we slipped out unobserved and took possession of an empty car,\nstationary some distance away, from which place we could see the train\ncoming, and yet be unseen from the station's platform. This train\nwould soon arrive, for passengers were already pacing the platform,\nthe luggage was placed in readiness, and a number of curious people,\nhaving nothing else to do, had assembled here to see the coming and\ngoing of the train. At last we heard its whistle, and, looking out, we\nsaw the headlight in the distance, drawing nearer and nearer. It\nsteamed into the station without making much noise, for the rails were\nslippery, there still being much ice and snow on the track. \"Come,\" I\nsaid to Jack, \"there is no time to lose;\" and we quickly jumped out of\nthe empty car.\n\nThis fast passenger train carried a blind baggage car, which means\nthat the end nearest to the engine was blind in having no door. Our\nobject was to suddenly appear from a hiding place, darkness being\nfavourable, and leap on the step of this car, and from that place to\nthe platform; this being done when the train was in motion, knowing\nthat the conductor, who was always on the watch for such doings,\nrarely stopped the train to put men off, even when sure of their\npresence. If he saw us before the train started, he would certainly\ntake means to prevent us from riding. When we had once taken\npossession of this car, no man could approach us until we reached the\nnext stopping place, which would probably be fifty miles, or much\nmore. At that place we would dismount, conceal ourselves, and, when it\nwas again in motion, make another leap for our former place. Of\ncourse, the engineer and fireman could reach us, but these men were\nalways indifferent, and never interfered, their business being ahead\ninstead of behind the engine.\n\nThe train whistled almost before we were ready, and pulled slowly out\nof the station. I allowed my companion the advantage of being the\nfirst to jump, owing to his maimed hand. The train was now going\nfaster and faster, and we were forced to keep pace with it. Making a\nleap he caught the handle bar and sprang lightly on the step, after\nwhich my hand quickly took possession of this bar, and I ran with the\ntrain, prepared to follow his example. To my surprise, instead of at\nonce taking his place on the platform, my companion stood\nthoughtlessly irresolute on the step, leaving me no room to make the\nattempt. But I still held to the bar, though the train was now going\nso fast that I found great difficulty in keeping step with it. I\nshouted to him to clear the step. This he proceeded to do, very\ndeliberately, I thought. Taking a firmer grip on the bar, I jumped,\nbut it was too late, for the train was now going at a rapid rate. My\nfoot came short of the step, and I fell, and, still clinging to the\nhandle bar, was dragged several yards before I relinquished my hold.\nAnd there I lay for several minutes, feeling a little shaken, whilst\nthe train passed swiftly on into the darkness.\n\nEven then I did not know what had happened, for I attempted to stand,\nbut found that something had happened to prevent me from doing this.\nSitting down in an upright position, I then began to examine myself,\nand now found that the right foot was severed from the ankle. This\ndiscovery did not shock me so much as the thoughts which quickly\nfollowed. For, as I could feel no pain, I did not know but what my\nbody was in several parts, and I was not satisfied until I examined\nevery portion of it. Seeing a man crossing the track, I shouted to him\nfor assistance. He looked in one direction and another, not seeing me\nin the darkness, and was going his way when I shouted again. This time\nhe looked full my way, but instead of coming nearer, he made one bound\nin the air, nearly fell, scrambled to his feet, and was off like the\nshot from a gun. This man was sought after for several weeks, by\npeople curious to know who he was, but was never found, and no man\ncame forward to say--\"I am he.\" Having failed to find this man, people\nat last began to think I was under a ghostly impression. Probably that\nwas the other man's impression, for who ever saw Pity make the same\nspeed as Fear?\n\nAnother man, after this, approached, who was a workman on the line,\nand at the sound of my voice he seemed to understand at once what had\noccurred. Coming forward quickly, he looked me over, went away, and in\na minute or two returned with the assistance of several others to\nconvey me to the station. A number of people were still there; so that\nwhen I was placed in the waiting room to bide the arrival of a doctor,\nI could see no other way of keeping a calm face before such a number\nof eyes than by taking out my pipe and smoking, an action which, I am\ntold, caused much sensation in the local press.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nHOSPITALITY\n\n\nI bore this accident with an outward fortitude that was far from the\ntrue state of my feelings. The doctor, seeing the even development of\nmy body, asked me if I was an athlete. Although I could scarcely claim\nto be one, I had been able, without any training, and at any time, to\njump over a height of five feet; had also been a swimmer, and, when\noccasion offered, had donned the gloves. Thinking of my present\nhelplessness caused me many a bitter moment, but I managed to impress\nall comers with a false indifference.\n\nWhat a kind-hearted race of people are these Canadians! Here was I, an\nentire stranger among them, and yet every hour people were making\nenquiries, and interesting themselves on my behalf, bringing and\nsending books, grapes, bananas, and other delicacies for a sick man.\nWhen a second operation was deemed necessary, the leg to be amputated\nat the knee, the whole town was concerned, and the doctors had to give\nstrict injunctions not to admit such a number of kind hearted\nvisitors. At this time I was so weak of body, that it was hopeless to\nexpect recovery from this second operation. This was soon made\napparent to me by the doctor's question, as to whether I had any\nmessage to send to my people, hinting that there was a slight\npossibility of dying under the chloroform. A minister of the gospel\nwas also there, and his sympathetic face certainly made the dying seem\nprobable. Now, I have heard a great deal of dying men having a\nforesight of things to be, but, I confess, that I was never more calm\nin all my life than at this moment when death seemed so certain. I did\nnot for one instant believe or expect that these eyes would again open\nto the light, after I had been in this low vital condition, deadened\nand darkened for over two hours, whilst my body was being cut and sawn\nlike so much wood or stone. And yet I felt no terror of death. I had\nbeen taken in a sleigh from the station to the hospital, over a mile\nor more of snow; and the one thought that worried me most, when I was\nsupposed to be face to face with death, was whether the town lay\nnorth, south, east or west from the hospital, and this, I believe, was\nthe last question I asked. After hearing an answer, I drew in the\nchloroform in long breaths, thinking to assist the doctors in their\nwork. In spite of this, I have a faint recollection of struggling with\nall my might against its effects, previous to losing consciousness;\nbut I was greatly surprised on being afterwards told that I had, when\nin that condition, used more foul language in ten minutes' delirium\nthan had probably been used in twenty-four hours by the whole\npopulation of Canada. It was explained to me that such language was\nnot unusual in cases of this kind, which consoled me not a little, but\nI could not help wondering if the matron had been present, and if she\nhad confided in her daughter. The latter was a young girl of sixteen\nyears, or thereabouts, and was so womanly and considerate that her\nmother could very well leave her in charge of the patients for the\nwhole day, although this had not been necessary during my stay.\n\nFor three days after this operation I hovered between life and death,\nany breath expected to be my last. But in seven or eight days my\nvitality, which must be considered wonderful, returned in a small way,\nand I was then considered to be well out of danger. It was at this\ntime that the kindness of these people touched me to the heart. The\nhospital was situated at the end of a long road, and all people, after\nthey had passed the last house, which was some distance away, were\nthen known to be visitors to the matron or one of her patients. On the\nverandah outside sat the matron's dog, and, long before people were\nclose at hand, he barked, and so prepared us for their coming. When it\nwas known that I was convalescent, this dog was kept so busy barking\nthat his sharp clear voice became hoarse with the exertion. They came\nsingle, they came in twos and threes; old people, young people and\nchildren; until it became necessary to give them a more formal\nreception, limiting each person or couple, as it might be, to a few\nminutes' conversation. On hearing that I was fond of reading, books\nwere at once brought by their owners, or sent by others; some of which\nI had not the courage to read nor the heart to return; judging them\nwrongly perhaps by their titles of this character:--\"Freddie's\nFriend,\" \"Little Billie's Button,\" and \"Sally's Sacrifice.\" With such\ngood attendance within, and so much kindness from without, what wonder\nthat I was now fit to return to England, five weeks after the\naccident, after having undergone two serious operations! My new\nfriends in that distant land would persuade me to remain, assuring me\nof a comfortable living, but I decided to return to England as soon as\npossible, little knowing what my experience would be in the years\nfollowing.\n\nWhen the morning came for my departure, the matron, in a motherly way,\nput her two hands on my shoulders and kissed me, her eyes being full\nof tears. This, coming from a person whose business was to show no\nemotion, doing which would make her unfit for her position, made me\nforget the short laugh and the cold hand shake for which my mind had\nprepared itself, and I felt my voice gone, and my throat in the\nclutches of something new to my experience. I left without having the\nvoice to say good-bye. On my way I had to wish good-bye to every one\nI met, and when, at last, this ordeal was over, and I was in the train\non my way back to Montreal, I felt that I was not yet strong enough to\ntravel; my courage forsook me, and I sat pale and despondent, for I\nnever expected to meet these people again, and they were true friends.\n\nSoon I reached Montreal. Only two months had elapsed, and what a\ndifference now! Two months ago, and it was winter, snow was on the\nearth, and the air was cold; but I was then full limbed, full of\nvitality and good spirits, for summer like prospects golden and\nglorious possessed me night and day. It was summer now, the earth was\ndry and green, and the air warm, but winter was within me; for I felt\ncrushed and staggered on crutches to the danger of myself and the\npeople on my way. I soon got over this unpleasant feeling, roused by\nthe merry-makers aboard ship, the loudest and most persistent, strange\nto say, being a one-legged man, who defied all Neptune's attempts to\nmake him walk unsteady. Seeing this man so merry, I knew that my\nsensitiveness would soon wear off; and, seeing him so active was a\ngreat encouragement. I was soon home again, having been away less than\nfour months; but all the wildness had been taken out of me, and my\nadventures after this were not of my own seeking, but the result of\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nLONDON\n\n\nSitting at home, thinking of future employment, manual labour being\nnow out of the question, it was then for the first time that I\nexpressed gratitude for my old grandmother's legacy, which, on my home\ncoming from the States had been reduced from ten shillings to eight\nshillings per week. In the past it had been sniffed at and scorned,\nbeing called several ill-natured names, such as \"a week's tobacco,\" \"a\nday's grub,\" or \"an evening's booze without cigars.\" I had been very\nbitter, on the reading of her will, that the property had not come\ninto my hands, to sell or retain, spend or save; but a little common\nsense now told me that if such had been the case I would, at the\npresent time, have been without either property or income, and had\nbeen so less than twelve months after her death. The old lady, no\ndoubt, had noted my wildness, and to save me the temptation to\nsquander my brother's share, who was incapable of taking charge of his\nown affairs, and whose share I must have ill managed, after the\npassing of my own she had wisely left this property to remain in the\nhands of a trustee, which now turned out as lucky for myself as for\nmy brother.\n\nI was now more content with my lot, determined that as my body had\nfailed, my brains should now have the chance they had longed for, when\nthe spirit had been bullied into submission by the body's activity.\n\nIt was now the middle of Summer, and daily I sat dreaming, reading,\nand occasionally writing in a leafy bower in the garden. I could now\ndispense with crutches, having just received from London an artificial\nlimb, and on this was practising, taking short walks at night, with a\nsuccess that was gratifying. A far different Klondyke had opened up\nbefore my eyes, which corresponded with the dreams of my youth. I\npictured myself returning home, not with gold nuggets from the far\nWest, but with literary fame, wrested from no less a place than the\nmighty London. This secret was never divulged to my people, and, in\nthe after years, this reticence saved them from many a pang of\ndisappointment, and freed me from many an awkward question. Determined\nto lose no time in the conquest of that city, which I expected would\nbe surrendered to me some time within twelve months, I began, without\nwasting more time in dreams, to make preparations for this journey.\nAlas! how many greater men failed in a lifetime at this attempt,\nalthough they now stand triumphant in death, holding in their\nspiritual hands the freedom and keys of the whole world's cities!\n\nWith a cotton shirt, a pair of stockings and a handkerchief in a brown\npaper parcel, and the sum of two pounds in my pocket, after the\nexpense of train fare, I started for London, filled to the brim with\nthe aforesaid designs. My failure in the States, and again in Canada,\nhad made me a little more chary with my confidence, but I was not in\nthe least the less optimistic. My first dreams were, and are, my best.\nI scorn clothes and jewellery; I would rather take a free country\nwalk, leaving the roads for the less trodden paths of the hills and\nthe lanes, than ride in a yacht or a coach; I would rather see the\nmoon in the ruins than the gaslight of an assembly room; gluttony I\ndespise, and drink is seldom taken except at the invitation of other\neyes: then what, in the name of everything we know, would be to me the\nsilver and gold of all Alaska!\n\nI arrived in London early the following morning, and at once made my\nway towards Lambeth. Early that night, being tired with the exertion\nof an unusually long day, I went seeking for lodgings in Blackfriars\nRoad, and, seeing several signs that claimed to accommodate working\nmen with good clean beds at sixpence per night, entered one of these\nestablishments, paid the amount demanded, and was then ushered into a\nlong kitchen, preferring to sit and smoke for an hour before retiring\nfor the night. Some thirty or forty men were in this kitchen, but the\nBritish Workman had either not yet arrived, was out drinking his pint,\nor had gone early to bed. This was not by any means my first\nexperience in England of lodging houses, for I had been forced to live\nin similar places on my visits in cattle ships from America; but I\ncertainly did not like the look of this place, where no sign of\nauthority was to be seen, and which seemed to be entirely left to the\ncontrol of these noisy men. Some of these lodgers had been old\nsoldiers, had just received their pensions--the accumulation of three\nmonths. A number of them were bringing in cans of beer, and the\nkitchen was in an uproar. Many of them were too drunk to perform this\ntask, but were sufficiently sober to sit awake and give money and\norders to others, and there was no lack of willing hands to bring them\nwhat they required. I left the kitchen at once, determined to seek\nanother place, without troubling the landlady to refund my money. As I\nleft the kitchen, two drunken men began to fight; others interfered,\nand this fight threatened to become an all round affair. When I had\nreached the top of the stairs, feeling my way in the dark, I found the\nlandlady standing at the office door. Seeing me, as I was about to\npass her, she said, in a voice which was the worse for drink--\"So you\nwant to go to bed? Here, Jim, show this gentleman to his bed.\" Jim\nobeyed, a small, pale-faced child, whom I mechanically followed up\ntwo flights of stairs, which were better lighted than those leading to\nthe kitchen, which was in the basement of the house. He then showed me\ninto a room where there were a number of beds, and, pointing to one,\nsaid--\"You are number forty-five,\" when he left the room. Many of the\nbeds already contained sleepers. I sat down on the edge of mine,\nwondering if there would be any disturbance in the night, whether any\nof these men would take a fancy to my clothes, or in the dark were\nlikely to rummage their contents. The man in the next bed coughed, and\nthen, turning towards me, said gently--\"The beds are good, I admit,\nbut that is about all you can say of this house.\" Second voice, not\nfar away: \"You've come to a good house, you have, and yer don't know\nit.\" First voice: \"If I hadn't been drunk last night and got chucked\nout of Rowton's, I wouldn't, on any account, be here.\" A third voice,\ndistant, but loud and angry: \"Give over, will yer: when are you coves\ngoing to sleep? I ain't done any labour for three weeks, and now as\nI've got a chance at four in the mornin', blow me if I ain't robbed of\nmy slumber. Take care I don't set about yer at once, yer blooming lot\nof bleeders. If I come arter yer body, yer'll know it, and no mistake\nabout it, either.\" No more was said after this. I at once made up my\nmind to try Rowton House on the following day. That they had refused\nthis man a bed owing to his being drunk, and, more than likely,\nquarrelsome in drink, was a strong recommendation to me after my\nexperience here, where it would be impossible to either read, write or\nthink, or to even partake of my meals in comfort.\n\nThe following morning, after having had breakfast at an eating house,\nI enquired for Rowton House, and when the first person I addressed\nasked which one I wanted, I answered him--\"the nearest one.\" This\nproved to be in Newington Butts and, after receiving instructions, I\nproceeded accordingly, and was soon standing outside that place, where\nI was to remain for two years, without in the least impressing London.\nTo my surprise, I found this house to be a fine large block of red\nbuildings, with an imposing front, and a fine entrance, polished and\nclean; and, facing its many front windows, was an old church tower and\nclock, set in an old leafy churchyard that had stones for the dead and\na number of wooden seats for the living.\n\nOn making an application for a bed, I learnt that this could not be\ngranted until nine o'clock in the evening, but was courteously allowed\nthe privilege of remaining indoors until that time. This place\nsurprised me by its accommodation of dining rooms, library, sitting\nrooms, baths, lavatories, etc., all being kept clean and in thorough\ngood order by a large staff of men, its charge being sixpence per\nnight.\n\nOn making my way into the library, and seeing two large cases of\nbooks, one containing fiction, and the other being enriched by the\npoets, historians, essayists, with biography and miscellaneous\nliterature, and hearing how quiet this room was, in spite of the\npresence of over a hundred men, I at once made up my mind to pay a\nweek's lodgings down, indifferent whether the sleeping accommodation\nwas good or bad. This I did at nine o'clock, after which I sat\nsometimes reading the paper, and again watching the faces of this\nmixed assembly. Some of them were of refined appearance, with their\nsilk hats, their frock coats, cuffs and collars, and spoke in voices\nsubdued and gentle. Some of them were of such a prosperous appearance\nthat no doubt I had already passed them in the street, thinking they\nwere either merchants or managers of great concerns; and, more likely\nthan not, the paper boys had followed on their heels, and the cabmen\nhad persistently hailed them.\n\nIf I wanted to devote my time to study, living on eight shillings per\nweek, this was apparently a suitable place for my purpose. Being my\nown barber, doing my own plain cooking, and living abstemiously,\nrenouncing drink and the pleasures of theatres, and other indoor\nentertainments, and retaining tobacco as my sole luxury--I saw no\nreason why this could not be done, at the same time making up my mind\nthat it had to be done.\n\nI had been here little more than a week, when I set to work in\nearnest, and the result of two months' diligence was a tragedy,\nwritten in blank verse, and which I called \"The Robber.\" Never\ndreaming but what it would at once meet with success, owing to its\nbeing full of action--a very difficult thing to marry to verse, but\nwhich I thought was successfully accomplished--I was somewhat taken\naback to have it returned to me on the third day, with the manager's\nregret. Now it seemed that the Rowton House had a bad name, owing to\nthe great number of criminals that were continually in the Police\nCourts giving that address. Some of these lodgers, for that very\nreason, had their correspondence addressed to various small shops,\nwhere they were customers for tobacco, papers, and groceries.\n\nOn having this tragedy returned, I, thinking of this, came to the\nconclusion that no respectable person would be likely to consider or\nrespect any work, or application for the same, that emanated from a\nhouse of this name. I spoke to a gentleman with whom I had become\nacquainted, on this difficult subject, and he agreed with me, saying\nthat such were the true facts of the case. \"But,\" said he, after a\nthoughtful pause, \"as your means are so limited, and the shopkeepers\ncharge one penny for every letter they receive on a customer's behalf,\nwould it not be as well to still have your correspondence addressed\nhere, but in another way, of which you probably have not heard? Give\nyour address as number one Churchyard Row, and, although people will\nnot recognise this house under that name, yet the post office\nauthorities will know it for its proper address.\" This I did, without\nfurther question, and \"The Robber\" was despatched on a second journey.\nFourteen days after my robber returned to number one Churchyard Row.\nBothering my head to account for this, I came to the conclusion that\nmy tragedy had not been read farther than the front page, and that a\ntragedy that was born and bred in such a place as Churchyard Row--the\naddress being so appropriate to the nature of the work--was enough to\nmake any man, who had the least sense of humour, condemn it with a\nlaugh. My conceit, at this time, was foolish in the extreme, and yet I\nwas near my thirtieth year.\n\nThe next work was a very long poem, in which the beasts of the field,\nthe birds of the air, and even the fishes of the sea, met in a forest\nglade to impeach man for his cruelty to them, and went on to describe\ntheir journey at midnight to the nearest town, and the vengeance they\nthen took on the sleeping inhabitants. My confidence in this work\nbeing accepted could not have been altogether whole-hearted, for the\nfollowing reason: I made two copies of this poem, and posted them\nsimultaneously to different publishers. I felt quite satisfied that\none of these would be accepted, but when a whole week had passed on,\nand I had received no communication from either publisher, I was then\nhorrified to think that they both were giving the poem such a\nconsideration that there was a probability that both of them would\naccept it, and that both publishers would call on me to make terms,\nperhaps at the very same hour. This thought so preyed on my mind that\nI did not feel at all easy until I had one of the copies returned; but\nit was a great disappointment to receive the second copy on the\nfollowing day.\n\nThinking that short poems would stand a better prospect of being\naccepted, I set to work on a hundred sonnets, writing five, and\nsometimes six a day, but when this number had been accomplished and\nsubmitted, this work met with the same failure. After this I wrote\nanother tragedy, a comedy, a volume of humorous essays, and hundreds,\nI believe, of short poems. I was always writing at this time, either\nbeginning or finishing a work, but, strange to say, none of this work\nwas being sent out, but was safely treasured, under the impression\nthat it would some day find its market.\n\nAfter having had twelve months' practice, in the last months of which\nno attempt had been made at publication, I decided to make one more\neffort, this time with a small volume of short poems. This was\nimmediately sent to a well known publisher, who in a few days returned\nanswer, offering to publish at the author's expense, the sum needed\nbeing twenty-five pounds. This success completely turned my head.\nWith all my heart I believed that there would not be the least\ndifficulty in procuring money for such a grand purpose, and at once\nwrote to several well known philanthropists, writing six letters. Two\nof them never murmured, and the other four set their secretaries to\nsnap me up in a few words. Exasperated at this I wrote to several\nothers, all my trouble being to no purpose.\n\nNow, when I first entered this lodging house, I had something like\nthirty shillings to the good, being ahead of my income, and up to the\npresent had no reason for spending this amount. Could I put this to\nsome use? My mind had several plans, and one in particular seemed good\nand feasible. I would write three or four short poems on a page, get\nthem printed, and sell them from door to door. Two thousand of these\nsheets, sold at threepence per copy, would be twenty-five pounds, and,\nno doubt, I could sell quite a hundred of these copies a day,\nproviding I went from house to house, from street to street, from\nearly morning till late at night. With this object I lost no time in\nseeing a job printer, and was told that thirty-five shillings would be\nneeded to defray expenses. This large amount disappointed me not a\nlittle, but I paid a deposit and went back to the house, where I lived\nand nearly starved in saving four shillings that were short, which was\ndone in two weeks out of the sixteen shillings that were to maintain\nme in food and lodgings for fourteen days. At last, after great\nprivation and sacrifice, it was done, and I received from the printer\ntwo thousand and some odd copies. Early the next morning I was to be\nseen in the suburbs of London, with my hands and pockets full of these\ncopies, going from door to door. I mentioned to the inhabitants that I\nhad had an offer from a publisher, and that he could not undertake to\npublish my work under twenty-five pounds. All these people did was to\nstare, none of them seeming to understand, and no one seemed inclined\nto ask questions. I had, I believe, visited the doors of some thirty\nhouses or more, and had not sold one copy. Most of these people were\npoor, and some had become sufficiently interested to enquire the price\nof my copies, seeming inclined and willing to trade with me in a small\nway, but none of them seemed to be anxious to give threepence for a\nsheet of paper which they did not understand. At last I chanced upon a\nhouse that was much larger than the others, at which place a servant\nanswered the door. I lost no time in relating to her the true facts of\nthe case, and she was standing there silent and puzzled as to my\nmeaning, when her mistress called to her from the top of the\nstairs--\"Mary, who's there?\" On which the maiden gave answer in a\nhalting voice--\"Some man selling some paper.\" At this there was a\npause, and then the same voice said, from the direction of the\nstairs--\"Give him this penny, and tell him to go away,\" and, almost\ninstantly, that copper coin fell at the bottom of the stairs, and came\nrolling rapidly towards us, as though aware of its mission. The girl\nhanded me this penny, which I took mechanically, at the same time\npersisting in her taking a copy to her mistress. That lady, hearing\nour further conversation, and perhaps, guessing its import, cried\nagain, this time in a warning voice--\"Mary, mind you don't take\nanything from him.\" This crushed the last hope, for I began to think\nthat if this lady, who might be a woman of some cultivation and rich,\ncould only see and read what had been done, she might have at once, in\nher deep interest, merged the whole twenty-five pounds, at the same\ntime befriending me for life. Alas! I have been unfortunate all my\nlife in believing that there were a great number of rich people who\nwere only too eager to come forward and help talent in distress.\n\nI was so disgusted at receiving this single penny, and being so\ndismissed, that I at once put the sheets back in my pockets and\nreturned to the city. How long would it take to get twenty-five\npounds, at this rate? What am I talking about! Money was lost, not\neven this single copper was a gain; for this penny-a-day experience\nhad cost me three pennies in tram fare, without mention of a more\nexpensive breakfast than I usually had.\n\nWhen I got back to the house I started, with the fury of a madman, to\nburn the copies, and did not rest until they were all destroyed,\ntaking care not to save one copy that would at any time in the future\nremind me of my folly.\n\nIt was at this time that I came under the influence of Flanagan. That\ngentleman, seeing me often writing and apparently in deep thought, at\nonce gave me credit for more wisdom than I possessed. He was a very\nilliterate man, having no knowledge of grammar, punctuation or\nspelling. The upshot of this acquaintance was that he informed me in\nconfidence that he was the lawful heir to nearly half the county of\nMayo, in Ireland; on which estate was a house like the King's palace.\nIn exchange for this confidence I told him that I was the author of a\nbook of verse, which could not be published except the author defrayed\nexpenses. On which Flanagan expressed much sympathy--more especially\nwhen I read him aloud a few lines expressing my disapproval of\nlandowners and rich tyrants--and promised sincerely to relieve me of\nall difficulty providing, of course, that he made good his claims to\nthe estate. Flanagan then proposed that I should put some of his\narguments in grammatical form, which he would immediately forward to\nthe proper authorities. This I began to do at once, and some of\nFlanagan's arguments were so strong that I am surprised at the present\nday at being a free man. I told one eminent statesman that he should\nretire and give place to a more honest man, and another that though he\nwas born in Ireland and bore the name of an Irishman, yet he was a\ntraitor, for his heart had ever been in England. Despite these\npowerful letters, the County Mayo never to my knowledge changed hands,\nand I was disappointed in my expectations, and Flanagan grieved daily.\nAt that time, I must confess, I thoroughly believed Flanagan, perhaps\nthrough being blinded by my own ambitions as an author. Even at the\npresent time, though I have cut down the estate considerably, from\nhalf a county to half an acre, and have taken out quite a number of\nwindows from the estate's residence--after doing this, I still believe\nthat poor Flanagan was robbed of a cottage and garden by an avaricious\nlandlord.\n\nThis was at the time of the Boer War and Flanagan's long dark beard\nand slouched hat gave him the exact appearance of one of those\ndespised people. Therefore we seldom took a walk together but what we\nwere stoned by boys in the street, and even grown up people passed\ninsulting remarks. In fact everywhere we went we were regarded with\nsuspicion. Our clothes not being of the best, drew the attention of\nattendants at museums and art galleries, and we, being swarthy and\nalien in appearance, never paused near a palace but what sentry and\npolice watched our every movement. One morning we were passing\nthrough Whitehall, what time a regiment of soldiers were being drilled\nand inspected by a gentleman in a silk hat. Now Flanagan was a man of\ngreat courage and never thought it necessary to whisper. Therefore a\nvein of savage satire broke in Flanagan's heart when he beheld a man\nin a silk hat inspecting a troop of soldiers. \"See!\" he cried,\n\"there's a sight for the Boers.\" A number of bystanders resented this\nremark, and there were loud murmurs of disapproval. On which Flanagan\nasked the following question: \"Will the best man in the crowd step\nforward?\" But no man seemed inclined to attempt Flanagan's\nchastisement, without being assisted. Although I did not entirely\napprove of him on this occasion, still, seeing that the words could\nnot be recalled, I was quite prepared to be carried with him half dead\non a stretcher to the nearest hospital; for I liked the man, and he\ncertainly seemed to like me, since he always took his walks alone when\nI did not accompany him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE ARK\n\n\nI had now been two years in London, at the same place, and though my\nliterary efforts had not been very successful, I must confess that the\nconditions had not been the most unfavourable for study; and, no\ndoubt, I had cultivated my mind not a little by the reading of\nstandard works. The conditions of this place could not have been\nbettered by a person of such small means, and probably I would have\ncontinued living here until I met with some success, had I not known\nof one who would be thankful of a couple of shillings a week, and\nresolved to make a little sacrifice that would enable me to send them.\nTo do this it was necessary to seek cheaper lodgings where, rent not\nbeing so high, this amount could be saved. I had heard something of\nsuch a place in Southwark which was under the control of the Salvation\nArmy. A bed was to be had there for two shillings per week, therefore\none and sixpence would be saved at the onset, as I was now paying\nthree and sixpence. Following my first impulse, as usual, but with\nmuch regret at having to leave a place where I had not by any means\nbeen unhappy, I gathered up my few things and left, and that night\nsettled in Southwark Street.\n\nSpeaking after six months' experience at the Salvation Army Lodging\nHouse, I am very sorry that I have nothing at all to say in its\nfavour. Of course, it was well understood by the lodgers, whatever\npeople on the outside thought, that no charity was dispensed on the\npremises. Certainly the food was cheap, but such food as was not fit\nfor a human being. I do not know whether the place came under the\ncontrol of the London County Council, being regarded as a charitable\ninstitution, or whether, in case of a surprise visit from its\ninspectors, beds were removed in the day: what I do know from\nexperience is this, that it was with difficulty that a man could find\nroom between the beds to undress. A row of fifteen or twenty beds\nwould be so close together that they might as well be called one bed.\nMen were breathing and coughing in each other's faces and the stench\nof such a number of men in one room was abominable. I was fortunate in\nhaving a bed next to the wall, to which I could turn my face and\nescape the breath of the man in the next bed.\n\nThe officers in charge were, according to my first opinion,\nhypocrites; which seemed to be verified some time after from Head\nQuarters, for both the Captain and his Lieutenant were dismissed from\nthe Army. However, the Captain was well liked by the lodgers, and I\nhave often seen him assist them out of his own private purse.\n\nAs for the Lieutenant, he was very gentle and fervent in prayer, more\nso than any man I have ever heard, but in conversation he had not a\ncivil word for any one, except, of course, his superior officer. He\nsometimes made his deceit so apparent that I have been forced to laugh\nout. When the Captain arrived at night, or in the morning--he was a\nmarried man and did not live on the premises--he would stand with his\nback to the restaurant bar, looking down the long room at the faces of\nhis many lodgers. It was at such a time that when I have looked up\nfrom my meal, I have been surprised, and not a little startled, to see\nthis Lieutenant's pale thin face looking down through a glass window,\neager to see what his superior officer was doing. So engrossed would\nhe be that he would entirely forget that he exposed his deceit to the\neyes of a number of men who had their faces turned towards him.\nSometimes he would creep tiptoe to the kitchen door and peep in for an\ninstant, and then creep back to the office. I have often wondered that\nthe Captain never turned and surprised him in these doings, for there\nwas not a lodger in the house that had not one time or another seen\nhim perform them.\n\nOn Sunday afternoons, these two, the Captain and his Lieutenant, would\nconduct a meeting; the latter commencing it with a short prayer, after\nwhich the former would preach a sermon which was, I must confess,\noften interesting, and invariably eloquent. In all my life I have\nnever heard a more pathetic address and prayer than that which was\ndelivered by this Captain, on one of these Sunday afternoons. It so\nchanced that in this place there lived a poor half demented lodger,\nwho was known by the name of Horace, whose profession was that of a\nflower seller. Every night this man would dress and garland himself\nwith his unsold flowers, and return home drunk to the Ark. Now, this\nman suddenly disappeared, and, at the same time, a man committed\nsuicide from London Bridge, which was well known to be the haunt of\nthe man Horace. Whereat the following Sunday our Captain preached a\nfuneral oration, giving for our interest the few facts he had gleaned\nfrom the past life of the deceased, who, the Captain affirmed, had\nreceived a good education and had come of a respectable family. The\nCaptain wept copiously, being overcome by his feelings, and the\nLieutenant approved and encouraged him by an unusual number of sighs\nand broken sobs. The meeting then ended with an earnest prayer for the\nsoul of the drowned Horace. About six days after this meeting had\ntaken place, there came to the Ark a man drivelling and laughing\nidiotically, with wreaths and posies all over his person--no other\nthan the lamented Horace. The Captain came out of his office, followed\nby his Lieutenant. The Captain looked at Horace with a melancholy\nannoyance; the Lieutenant looked first at his superior officer and,\nafter receiving his expression into his own face, turned it slowly on\nHorace. The Captain then turned slowly on his heels, at the same time\nshaking his head, and, without saying a word, returned to the office,\nwhile his subordinate followed him in every particular. Never, after\nthis, did this Captain treat Horace as a living man, and all chaff and\nfamiliar conversation was at an end between them. How the Captain came\nto the belief that the drowned suicide was Horace, the flower seller,\nwas very strange, for this man was known to mysteriously disappear\nseveral times in the year, he, invariably, like the drowned man he was\nsupposed to be, coming to the surface on the seventh day, seven days\nbeing the extreme penalty of his simple and eccentric behaviour.\n\nThere was no lack of strictness at this place; whether a man was ill\nor not, whether it rained, snowed or hailed, every lodger was\ncompelled to quit the premises at ten o'clock in the morning, after\nwhich it would remain closed for cleaning purposes until one o'clock.\nAnd yet there was not a man in the house could keep himself clean. It\nwas not thought necessary to close other establishments of this kind,\nthat were not connected with the name of religion, which were kept\ncleaner without making the lodgers suffer any inconvenience. Why\nthings should be carried on in this high handed fashion I cannot\nunderstand, seeing that there was not the least charity doled out.\nWhatever good the Salvation Army did for the homeless and penniless in\ntheir shelters, they certainly did not cater well for these poor, but\nindependent, fellows whose wages ranged from a shilling to\neighteenpence a day--being paper-men, sandwichmen, toy-sellers, etc.,\nwho receive nothing but what they paid for.\n\nI had been at this place something like four months, when I determined\nto make another attempt at publication. My plans at this time seemed\nto be very feasible, for I gave them a full half year for execution. I\napplied at the local police station for a pedlar's certificate,\nintending to stock myself with laces, pins, needles and buttons with\nwhich I would hawk the country from one end to the other. At the end\nof this time I would be some ten pounds in pocket, the result of not\ndrawing my income, and would, no doubt, save between nine and ten\nshillings a week as a hawker. Being very impulsive, I proposed\nstarting on this interesting business at once, but one idea--which\ncould not for long be overlooked--brought me to a halt: my artificial\nleg would certainly not stand the strain of this enforced march from\ntown to town on the country roads, that were so often rough and\nuneven. For even now it was creaking, and threatened at every step to\nbreak down. On mentioning these difficulties to a fellow lodger, he at\nonce advised me to go to the Surgical Aid Society for a wooden leg, of\nthe common peg sort; which, he was pleased to mention, would not only\nbe more useful for such a knockabout life, but would not deceive\npeople as to my true condition. This society was visited by me on the\nfollowing day; at which place I was informed that fifteen subscription\nletters would be required for my purpose, and after paying sixpence\nfor a subscription book, in which were the names and addresses of\nseveral thousand subscribers, I lost no time in buying stamps and\nstationery. Eighteen letters were without loss of time written and\nposted to their destination. These eighteen succeeded in bringing in\ntwo subscription letters, several letters of regret from people who\nhad already given theirs away; several of my letters were returned\nmarked \"not at home,\" and a number of them elicited no response.\nTwelve more letters were quickly despatched, with the result of one\nsubscription letter. To be able to do this I was forced to use the\nsmall weekly allowance that I had been making. In six weeks I had\nwritten nearly a hundred letters and was still several letters short\nof my allotted number. I again consulted my fellow lodger, who had at\nfirst referred me to the Surgical Aid Society, and his explanation\nwas, undoubtedly, reasonable and true. He explained that not only was\nthe time of the year unfavourable, it being summer, and most of the\nsubscribers were away from home on their holidays--but, unfortunately,\nthe South African war was still in progress, and numbers of soldiers\nwere daily returning from the front in need of artificial assistance\none way or another. Although I ruminated with some bitterness on the\nidea that I would almost pay in postage the value of that which I\nrequired, before it became mine, I still had enough common-sense to\nsee that no one was actually to blame. Several letters were received,\noffering to assist me on certain conditions. One lady would assist on\na clergyman's recommendation, and another subscriber would have no\nother than a Roman priest. I offered to get these ladies a Salvation\nArmy Officer's recommendation, which, apparently, would not do, for\nour correspondence came to an end. One lady, who did not recognise the\nhouse of Salvation under the address of 96 Southwark Street, regretted\nthat she had already given her letters away, but advised me to go to\nthe Salvation Army, who would most certainly attend to my wants. I\nexplained to this person that I was already at one of their places,\nand had been here over five months; and that I had not been seen drunk\nin the place, and that my behaviour had not, at any time, raised\nobjections, also that I was on the most friendly terms with the\nofficer in charge; but that I could live here for many years to come,\nand no man would enquire my wants or offer to assist me.\n\nOne afternoon, when I returned to the Ark, after having been out all\nday, I was surprised to hear from a lodger that two gentlemen had been\nthere that afternoon to see me. After which another lodger came\nforward with the same information, and still another, until I was\nfilled with curiosity to know who those gentlemen could be. \"What did\nthey look like?\" I asked one. \"Like solicitors,\" he answered. \"What\nkind of looking men were they?\" I asked of another. \"Very much like\nlawyers,\" he answered at once. \"Don't forget to remember yer old\npals,\" chimed in another, \"when yer come into the property.\" First I\nexamined my mother's side of the family, and then my father's, but\ncould find no relative, near or distant, at home or abroad, whose\ndeath would be likely to befriend me. At last I went to the office,\nbut found this place closed, the Lieutenant being out walking, and the\nCaptain not yet having arrived. Never in my life did I have such an\nexcitable half hour as this. When I saw the Captain coming forward,\nsmiling, with an envelope in his hand, I went to meet him, and, taking\nthe letter in my own hand, began to examine its outside. \"Of course,\"\nsaid the Captain, \"you know who it is from?\" \"Not the least idea,\" I\nsaid, \"how should I?\", and proceeded to open it. It was a short note,\nwith a request that I should call on the Charity Organisation, between\nthe hours of ten and eleven a. m. on the day following. The Captain\nwent back to his office, and I sat down, thinking of what this would\namount to. Again I decided to consult the Canadian, the lodger who had\nfirst mentioned to me the Surgical Aid Society. \"As to that,\" said\nthis man, \"it's a wonder to me that you have not run foul of these\npeople before now. My friend, who sells papers in the city, was\ncontinually meddled and interfered with by these people, but they gave\nhim no assistance, although they seemed curious to know all about\nhim.\" This information surprised me not a little, but I came to the\nconclusion that the Canadian's friend was addicted to drink and other\nbad habits, and was an undeserving case.\n\nThe next morning I arose, lighthearted in anticipation of hearing\nsomething to my good, and was leaving the house when I saw the Captain\nstanding at the front door. Feeling some misgiving, I turned to this\ngentleman and asked him point blank--what was his opinion of the\nCharity Organisation. \"Well,\" he replied slowly, \"to give you my\ncandid opinion--although I may be mistaken--the object of the Charity\nOrganisation is not so much to give alms, as to prevent alms being\nwasted.\" How I remembered these words in the light of my after\nexperience with these people!\n\nAt ten o'clock punctually, I was at their office in the Borough Road,\nand was at once shown into a side room, where I sat waiting patiently,\nfor an hour. At last a gentleman in black came forward, saying, very\npolitely--\"Mr. Davies, will you please come this way.\" I followed him\nup two or three flights of stairs, and we entered a quiet room on the\ntop floor. Seating himself at a table, and taking pencil and paper,\nhe then asked me to be seated and began. \"Mr. Davies,\" he said, \"I\nhave received a letter from a lady who has become interested in your\ncase, and wishes to better your conditions. So as to answer this lady,\nit is necessary to know something of yourself, for which reason I\npropose asking you a few questions, which, of course, you need not\nanswer except you think proper.\" This he proceeded to do, at the same\ntime making notes of my answers. After answering a dozen or more\nquestions truthfully, dealing with particulars of my family, and my\npast life--he brought the case up to that time. \"Surely,\" he said,\n\"you do not live on eight shillings a week. I should have thought that\nto be impossible.\" \"As for that,\" I answered, \"not only has that sum\nbeen sufficient for myself, but I have been able to make another an\nallowance of two shillings a week, but have not been able to do so\nsince I applied to the Surgical Aid Society.\" \"Now tell me what is the\nmatter with that leg?\" asked this gentleman. \"I should have thought\nthat it would last for another two years at least. Excuse me, did you\nget that through the Society?\" \"No,\" I said, \"it cost me twelve\npounds, ten shillings, when I could ill afford the money, but,\nunfortunately, I knew nothing then of the Surgical Aid Society.\" \"The\nSociety, no doubt, does a large amount of good,\" continued this\ngentleman, \"but I don't altogether agree with their methods. You have\nwritten quite a number of letters?\" he asked; \"and I don't suppose any\nof the subscribers helped you with the postage, sending you a trifle\nto defray expenses?\" At this point he made a long pause, and I began\nto tell him that all the help I had received was from a gentleman who,\nhaving no letters left to assist me with, had very considerately sent\ntwelve stamps to help my correspondence. The Charity Organisation\nshowed much interest at this point of the conversation, and said that\nhe thought quite a number of subscribers would have done the same. \"As\nI have already said,\" he continued, \"I don't altogether agree in the\nmethods of the Surgical Aid Society; their cases are maintained too\nlong without result, and allows too good an opportunity for writing\nbegging letters.\" Not even now could I see the drift of this man's\nquestions--that he suspected me of being an impostor, of writing\nbegging letters. Yes, I, who was bitter at having to bear all this\nexpense, and was grieved at having to withhold two shillings a week\nfrom one who was very poor, so that I might be enabled to do so. \"How\nmany letters do you now need?\" he asked. \"Two,\" I answered, \"but I\ndon't intend to be at any further expense in postage; I will take in\nwhat letters I have already received, and explain to the Surgical Aid\nSociety the difficulty I have had in trying to obtain the requisite\nnumber.\" This ended our interview, and I went away satisfied that the\nCharity Organisation would come to my rescue in the near future. But I\ndid not again hear from them for over two years, which will be\nexplained in another chapter. How they answered the kind lady who had\nbecome interested in me, I cannot say, but it could not have been\nother than to my discredit.\n\nThe day following this interview, three letters were at the, office,\nall three coming by the first post. One of them contained a\nsubscription letter, so that I now only lacked one of the required\nnumber. One of the other letters came from the Surgical Aid Society,\nsaying that a subscriber had forwarded to them a letter to be entered\nto my account, and that if I would call at their office with the\nletters I then had, the Society would make up the number deficient.\nThe required number was now made up, without having need to draw on\nthe Society. I now took these letters to their office, and in a day or\ntwo received the article which had caused me so much bother in writing\nletter after letter, and such an expense in postage. By a sad irony,\nthe worry and expense was by no means at an end, as I had expected.\nPeople were now returning from the continent, and other places where\nthey had spent their summer holidays. Letters came to me daily from\npeople returning home. Some of my own letters, which had been posted\nthree, four, five and six weeks before, were now being considered.\nSeveral subscription letters came to hand--too late for use. Others\nwrote asking if I was still in need of assistance. I was now at as\ngreat an expense as ever, returning these subscription letters with\nthanks; and writing to others to tell them that I had now succeeded in\nobtaining the required number. Letters were still coming when I left\nthe Ark for the country; and, it was told me afterwards, that a goodly\nnumber had come, been kept for a number of days, and returned during\nmy absence.\n\nI was more determined than ever to tramp the country until I was worth\nthirty pounds, for an offer had again been made by a publisher, during\nmy stay at the Ark, and this offer was much the same as the other.\nSeeing that there was no other way of getting this amount than by\nhawking the country, I determined to set out as soon as possible. So,\nwhen my business with the Surgical Aid Society was at an end, I spent\nthree or four shillings on laces, needles, pins, buttons, etc., and\nstarted with a light heart and not too heavy a load. The Canadian, who\nhad had some experience in this kind of life, prophesied good results\nfrom it, adding that a man situated the same way as I was, need carry\nno other stock in trade than that which I had received from the\nSurgical Aid Society, and that success was assured, on that very\naccount.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nGRIDLING\n\n\nIt was a beautiful morning in September when I left the Ark with every\nprospect of fulfilling this mission. As I advanced towards the\ncountry, mile after mile, the sounds of commerce dying low, and the\nhuman face becoming more rare, I lost for the time being my vision of\nthe future, being filled with the peace of present objects. I noted\nwith joy the first green field after the park, the first bird that\ndiffered from the sparrow, the first stile in the hedge after the\ncarved gate, and the first footpath across the wild common that was\nneither of gravel nor ash. I had something like nine shillings in my\npocket, and I felt that business was out of the question as long as\nany of this remained. Reaching St. Albans on the first night, I walked\nthrough that town, and, making a pillow of my pack, lay down on the\nwild common. It seemed as though extra bodies of stars had been\ndrafted that night into the heavens to guard and honour the coming of\nage of a beautiful moon. And this fine scene kept me awake for two or\nthree hours, in spite of tired limbs. This seemed to me a glorious\nlife, as long as summer lasted and one had money to buy food in towns\nand villages through which he passed. For three or four days I walked\nand idled, standing on culverts and watching the water burst from\ndarkness into light; listening to the birds; or looking at a distant\nspire that was high enough, and no more, to show that a quiet town was\nlying there under a thousand trees.\n\nI reached Northampton, and it was in this town that I intended to\nstart business on the following day, though I still had a few\nshillings left, having slept in the open air since leaving London.\nWith this object I proceeded to examine my pack, with the intention of\nfilling my pockets with the different wares, to draw them forth one or\ntwo at a time, as they would be needed. So, that night, previous to\nthe great business that was to be transacted on the following day, I\nsought a quiet corner in the lodging house, and began to unroll my\npaper parcel. As I proceeded to do this, it seemed to me that the\ninner part of the parcel was damp, and then I remembered the two or\nthree heavy showers that we had on the second day of my travels. On a\nfurther examination I discovered, to my horror, that the goods were\nentirely unfit for sale; that the parcel had been so bent and\nmisshapen one way and the other, during my night's repose, that the\nneedles had cut through their rotten packets, and were stuck in the\npin papers, and that a great number of pins had concealed their whole\nbodies in the needle packets, showing plainly the guilty tops of their\nheads. The laces were twisted and turned, and their tags were already\nrusted. This was a great blow to me, as there seemed nothing else to\ndo but send home for the few shillings that had now become due. But on\nsecond thoughts I made up my mind to travel without stock of any kind,\nnot doubting but what I would rise to the emergency after the last\npenny had been expended, and I was under the force of necessity.\nThinking Northampton too large a town in which to starve, I determined\nto remain here until my funds were exhausted, when desperation would\nurge me to action. With this idea I took life very easily for a couple\nmore days, even inviting poverty by being unusually extravagant, going\nto the extreme of buying milk for my tea. But when I became reduced to\nthe last sixpence, I decided to make all speed to Birmingham, as the\nresources of that city, it being so much larger, would be a better\nplace to serve my wants.\n\nStarting on this journey, without any more delay, I was soon going\ninto the town of Rugby, tired, penniless, and hungry. What was I to\ndo? Something had to be done, and that at once. I had to face the\nhorrible truth that I was now on the verge of starvation. Whilst busy\nwith these unpleasant thoughts, I heard a voice shout to me from the\nroadside, and, looking in that direction, saw a man sitting in the\ngrass, eating from a paper parcel, which was half spread before him.\nOn going over to see what this man wanted, I found an apparently tall\nman and large in proportion, who was dressed in seedy looking clothes,\nwhich were torn and patched in a good many places. In fact, something\nseemed to have been gnawing night after night at the bottom of his\ntrousers, taking advantage of him in his sleep, for these hung in\ntatters and rags just below the calves of his legs. The man had a\nfreckled face, which was almost lost in an abundance of red hair, and\nhis head was as thick with the same. What helped to make his\nappearance strange, and perhaps ridiculous, was a schoolboy's small\ncap to cover the crown of such a large head. \"Have a mouthful of\nthis,\" he said, inviting me to partake of some bread and meat. \"It is\ndry eating, I must say, but, as we go into Rugby, we can wash it down\nwith a pint or two of beer.\" I thanked him for his kindness, and,\naccepting his invitation, seated myself on the grass. \"What's in your\nbundle,\" he asked, looking askance at a small brown paper parcel,\nwhich contained a clean shirt, socks and a handkerchief, \"are you\nselling anything?\" I explained to him that I was a licensed hawker,\nbut had not yet been long enough at the business to make a success of\nit. \"What,\" he cried with some surprise, \"a one legged man not to be\nsuccessful? I get all I want by just opening of my mouth,\" although he\nadded with some scorn, \"I know that some people cannot beg unless\nthey have something in their hands to sell. But if you travel with me,\nall you will have to do is to pick up the coppers.\"\n\nAfter I had finished eating, he proposed to set off immediately; and,\nas we walked leisurely along, I wondered how it was possible for a big\nhealthy fellow like this to be able to exist in any other manner than\nby selling. On coming to the first public house he politely invited me\nto enter, which I did, when he called for two pints of beer. He then\nbecame communicative, telling me he was a gridler, and a good one too;\nwhich I understood to mean a grinder, although I had not seen tools of\nany description either in his hands or in his pockets. He paid for two\nor three pints of beer in quick succession, and, not having had much\ndrink for a considerable time, I began to feel somewhat elated, and\nbegan to make a laughing joke of my circumstances. \"Now,\" said this\nman, \"to business; for we must get the price of our beds and a little\nbreakfast for the morning, not to mention the night's supper. All you\nhave to do,\" he said again, \"is to pick up the coppers as they come.\"\nWondering what these words could mean, I followed him, on this\npleasant afternoon, up several side streets, until we came to the end\nof one very long street, which had respectable looking houses on\neither side of the road. My strange companion walked several yards\ndown this street, and then came to a sudden halt in the middle of the\nroad. \"Now,\" said he, for the third or fourth time, \"all you have to\ndo is to pick up the coppers. I ask you to do no more; except,\" he\nadded, grinning rather unpleasantly, \"except to see that we are not\npicked up by the coppers.\" His joke appeared simple enough, and I\ncould not fail to understand it, but it was not at all to my relish.\nThe last named coppers were police officers, who would be likely to\ntake hold of us for illegally appropriating the copper coins of the\nrealm. \"Are you going to pick up the coppers?\" he asked a little\nimpatiently, seeing me standing irresolute and undecided as to what to\ndo. Scarcely knowing how to answer him, I said that if I saw any\ncoppers he need have no fear but what I would pick them up. \"All\nright, that's good,\" he said, at the same time moving several feet\naway from me. I stood still watching these mysterious movements, and\nthinking of the coppers, wondering from what source they would be\nsupplied. He now turned his back, without more ado, and, setting his\neyes on the front windows before him, began, to my amazement, to sing\na well known hymn, singing it in the most horrible and lifeless voice\nI have ever heard. In spite of the drink, which had now taken effect,\nmaking my head swell with stupidity, I still felt an overwhelming\nshame at finding myself in this position. I stood irresolute, not\nknowing whether to wait the result of this, or to leave him at once\nwith short ceremony. But, whilst ruminating in this frame of mind, I\nheard a window open with a loud creak, saw the shaking of a fair hand,\nand then heard a copper coin fall on the hard earth within a yard of\nwhere I stood. Being penniless I was nothing loth to take possession\nof this coin, and had scarcely done so, when a front door opened on\nthe other side of the street, and a fat florid old gentleman appeared\nand beckoned me across to him. Going immediately to this gentleman, I\nreceived twopence and, after thanking him, joined my companion in the\nroad. Now, as I belong to a race of people that are ever prone to\nsong, whether it be in a public house or a prayer meeting, it will not\nsurprise many to know that ere long I was making strong attempts to\nsing bass to this man's miserable treble, and only ceased to do so\nwhen it became necessary to stoop and pick up the coppers, which\ncontinued to come in at the rate of two to the minute. The effect of\nmy voice on my companion was immediately apparent. His limbs shook,\nhis knees bent and knocked together, and his voice quivered and\nquavered with a strong emotion. He was now singing another well-known\nhymn, better known perhaps than the last; and what with his tall form\nbent double to half its height, and the wringing of his hands in\ndespair--a poor wretch who was apparently broken both in body and\nspirit--he was, at this particular stage, the most miserable looking\nmortal I have ever beheld. He was in this old man's broken attitude\nwhen, to my surprise, he suddenly straightened his great body, and\ngazed about one second down the street. After which he quickly turned\non his heels, saying, in short peremptory tones--\"Quick march,\" at the\nsame time suiting the action to the words, in sharp military steps.\nWhat the people, in their different windows, and on their doors,\nthought of this change, I cannot say. I looked down the street, and\nthen saw that a police officer had just turned its far corner, and was\ncoming slowly in our direction. My companion waited for me at our end\nof the street, where I joined him as soon as possible. \"It is getting\nharder every day for a poor man to get a living,\" he said, when I\nstood beside him. \"Suppose you count the earnings,\" he said. \"We work\ntogether well.\" On doing this, I found twenty pennies to be in my\npossession, and, at his suggestion, we there and then shared them\nalike. \"Friend,\" he began, \"before we commence again, let me give you\na word or two of advice. First of all, you sing in too lusty a voice,\nas though you were well fed, and in good health. Secondly, you are in\ntoo much of a hurry to move on, and would get out of people's hearing\nbefore they have time to be affected. Try to sing in a weaker voice:\ndraw out the easy low notes to a greater length, and cut the difficult\nhigh notes short, as though you had spasms in the side. Your object\nis to save your voice as much as possible, indifferent to the demands\nof music, or the spirit of the song. When we start in another street,\"\nhe continued,--but at this admonitory point I cut him short, telling\nhim that I had had enough of--eh--gridling. \"What, enough of\nchanting?\" he cried in amaze. \"Why, my dear fellow, it is the best\nthing on the road, bar none. All right,\" he said, seeing my\ndetermination not to make a fresh start, \"we will make our way to the\nlodging house: it is not far from here.\"\n\nWe were soon comfortably settled in this place, and when, after having\nhad a good tea, I was sitting smoking, and enjoying a newspaper, I\nfelt more pleased than ashamed of what I had done; for I was going to\nbed with an easy stomach, and had coppers in my pocket for a good\nbreakfast. Therefore, when a fellow lodger, a hawker, who was now\ntaking an inventory of his wares, and who had probably seen and heard\nus singing that day, when following his own calling--when this man\nenquired of me if the town was good for gridlers, I answered him very\npleasantly indeed, that there was nothing to complain of.\n\nAfter breakfast, the next morning, my companion of the preceding day\nproposed putting in a good eight hours' work, but I at once cut him\nshort saying that such a business was not in my line. Now, several\nwomen were at this place; some of them were married, and some single,\nand most of them made and sold fancy work of embroidery. After I had\nspoken so decisively to my companion he had sat near to one of these\nwomen, at the other end of the kitchen. This woman, who seemed to be\nthe wife of a knife and scissors grinder, had a little girl of about\nseven years of age. \"Yes,\" said this woman, in answer to some question\nmy companion had made, \"you can have the kid all day; it's not the\nfirst time, by a long way, for Mary Ann to be used by gridlers, and\nshe knows as well as you what's wanted of her.\" Not long after this\nremark my companion and the woman's child left the kitchen together.\nThis I, subsequently, often saw done. Almost any woman, if she called\nherself a true traveller, would lend her child for this purpose; the\nwoman or child, of course, deriving some part of the profit: so that\nwhen a man is seen with one or more children, it is not always to be\ngranted that he is the father of them. These children are rarely\nsubjected to ill usage--except that of enforced tramping--but are more\noften spoilt by indulgence, especially if they show early signs of\nthat cunning which is needed for their future, and which is the boast\nof their parents.\n\nWhat a merry lot of beggars were assembled here; and how busy they all\nseemed to be, making articles for sale, and washing and mending their\nclothes! two or three of them sitting shirtless during the process of\ndrying.\n\nIt has become a common expression to say \"dirty tramp,\" or, \"as dirty\nas a tramp\"; but this is not always true, except occasionally in the\nlarge cities; although such a term may be applied morally to them all.\nThere is one species of tramp who wanders from workhouse to workhouse;\nand this man, having every night to conform strictly to the laws of\ncleanliness, is no less clean, and often cleaner, than a number of\npeople whose houses contain bath rooms which they seldom use. Another\nspecies of tramp is proud of being a good beggar, who scorns the\nworkhouse, but who knows well that a clean appearance is essential to\nhis success. For this reason, any one that enters a common lodging\nhouse can at once see what efforts are being made to this end. It\nseems strange to say, but the dirtiest looking tramp is often the most\nhonest and respectable, for he has not the courage to beg either food\nor clothes, nor will he enter the doors of a workhouse. I have seen\nthis so often the case that I would much prefer to believe a dirty\nragged tramp who might tell me that he had a good home six months\nprevious, than to believe his cleaner namesake, who seems so eager to\nimpart this information unsolicited. It is certainly the man who has\nhad a good home, and has been waited on by other hands, who soon\nsuccumbs to a filthy condition, when it becomes necessary to wait on\nhimself by washing and patching his own clothes; and the higher his\nformer position has been the lower he sinks in the social strata.\n\nIt is no difficult matter to get company when travelling. The pedlar,\nwhom I have mentioned before, asked me if I was going towards\nCoventry, and if I intended to do business on the road. To this\nquestion I answered that such might be the case, but I could not say\nfor sure--at the same time knowing that it was very unlikely. \"Come\nalong then,\" he said, \"and do business if you feel inclined; but, I\nwarn you, it is a very poor road for a gridler.\" We started at once,\nand, in the course of our journey I told him everything--my first\nexperience of gridling and my dislike to it, and how my wares had been\nspoilt by the rain, which had prevented me, through having no stock,\nnor money to buy it, from earning my living in a respectable manner as\na pedlar. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you have a pedlar's certificate?\" I\nanswered him in the affirmative, and added that I had not earned one\npenny with it up to that moment.\n\nAs we jogged along talking in this way, we came to a small village,\nwhen the pedlar, stopping short, asked if I would like to help him to\ndo a little trade. Knowing that something had to be done, as I had but\ntwopence halfpenny in my pocket, I assured him that I would. Hearing\nthis he took two bundles of laces from his pack, leather and mohair,\nand placed them in my hands, at the same time saying--\"You work on\none side of the village and I'll attend to the other.\" I passed\nseveral houses before I had the courage to knock at their doors, but\nseeing him go calmly from door to door, I nerved myself to follow his\nexample, and was soon doing the same, and, as far as I could see, was\nmeeting with more success. This so encouraged me that I was soon\nregretting that I had no more houses left on my side of the village.\nBut, instead of waiting patiently until he had done, I took a\ndesperate notion and went back to the houses which I had at first\npassed. After this we jogged on towards Coventry, which we reached\nthat evening.\n\nWe worked Coventry together for four or five days, and the result was\nnine shillings and some odd pence in my pocket. This pedlar was going\nto spend a week or two with a brother in Birmingham, whom he had not\nseen for a number of years. But, before we left Coventry, he persuaded\nme to stock myself with three shillings' worth of stuff, and, said he,\n\"never let a day pass you without doing some business, however little;\nand never allow your stock to get low.\" We reached Birmingham, and,\nafter he had shown and recommended a lodging house, he wished me\ngood-bye, with many hopes that we might meet again.\n\nAs usual, my first enquiry after I had settled for my lodgings, was\nfor the public library. This place I found so much to my liking, what\nwith its variety of journals, its number of papers, and so much\ncomfort and accommodation for its visitors--that business was entirely\nout of the question until the third day, when I woke to the awkward\nfact that my last three coppers were then being spent on a meal. At\nthis I made up my mind to hawk on the outskirts of Birmingham for a\nmonth or more, so that my evenings might be enjoyed in its library.\nBut, apparently, I was not cut out for this kind of business. Hawking\nrequired a perseverance which I certainly did not possess. For when a\nperson declined to make a purchase, instead of crying up the cheapness\nof my wares, I walked away dumbfounded to the next house. Yes, the\nsuccess or ill success of this buying and selling was all a simple\nmatter of tongue. A big able-bodied fellow, with a persistent tongue,\ncan talk charity out of the people who indifferently pass the silent\nblind man. Of course this business of hawking with a few cheap laces,\nand a few packets of common pins or needles, was after all only\nanother name for begging, and it was well for us that the people knew\nit, for they often paid for what they declined to receive. They knew\nthat these things were to be had much cheaper at a store. In\nexoneration of this fraudulent selling, a man was expected to tell\nsome tale of distress. This I found difficulty in doing, except on\nbeing asked direct questions; and the people would often stand after\nrefusing to purchase with their hands in their pockets ready to assist\non the first confession of distress. The number of times people have\ncalled me back, after I have left their doors, and assisted me, has\noften proved to me how they have waited to have their first feelings\nof pity strengthened by some recital of poverty. No doubt there was\nsome sort of a living to be made in this way, providing a man talked\nincessantly and went for hours from house to house, and from street to\nstreet; and when he failed in the line of business to plead for the\nsake of charity. It must have been over two hours and my takings had\namounted to ninepence, nearly all profit I admit. Looking at this\npaltry amount I now reversed my former opinion as to the resources of\na large city, and came to the conclusion that the small country towns\nand villages were after all more willing, if not better able, to\nsupport me. Therefore, instead of returning to the city I took the\nroad towards Warwick, intending when I reached that town to use my\ntongue to some purpose. And how many houses have I visited with this\nsame resolution, but, alas, many of the towns were passed through\nwithout any one hearing the sound of my voice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nON THE DOWNRIGHT\n\n\nOn my way towards Warwick I joined company with a grinder, and we\ntravelled socially together towards that ancient town. When we\narrived, we lost no time in seeking a lodging house, which we soon\nfound, but, to my surprise, the landlady, a big raw-boned, slatternly\nwoman said, looking sternly at my companion: \"I will have no grinders\nin my house.\" Of course, I did not know at that time what I have heard\nsubsequently. Of all the men on the road, following various\noccupations, the grinder is, I believe, the most thoroughly detested.\nAs a rule he is a drunken dissolute fellow, a swearer, and one who, if\nhe picks up a quarrel, which is usually the case, is in no hurry to\ndrop it. The more unpretentious lodgers hate his presence, seeing that\nhe makes himself more at home than the landlord himself. I have often\nheard travellers tell of a small village in the north of England,\nwhich grinders dare not enter, pass through or lodge therein for the\nnight, and it is the regret of many travellers that there are not more\nvillages of its kind distributed throughout the country. It seems\nthat some years ago, a great wind had visited that particular town,\nand floored the roofs of the houses, and grounded the church steeple,\nmany of the inhabitants being injured, and not a few killed. Now, it\nhappened that the day following this great disaster, two unfortunate\ngrinders, who had arrived in town the night before, and slept at the\nvillage inn, appeared in the streets and made a great shout in\nsoliciting orders. Some way or another the inhabitants connected these\npoor wretches with the great wind, and set upon them, and proceeded to\nbeat them out of the town, coming near to killing them; and, since\nthat day the town has been visited by neither grinders nor great\nwinds. Even in larger towns these people often experience great\ndifficulty in procuring lodgings. This state of affairs was not known\nto me at this time, or I should certainly not have been anxious for\nthe company of one of these despised people.\n\nWe were admitted at the next lodging house, but even here the landlady\nseemed to have some compunction at so doing; for she followed us to\nthe kitchen and without saying a word, placed her two hands on her\nbroad hips, at the same time looking severely at my grinder, as much\nas to say--\"If you are going to start any of your capers, let it be at\nonce, my hearty grinder, now I am watching you, and we'll soon see\nwho's who.\" We sat down quietly, and the landlady, thinking that this\nattitude had had its desired effect, left the kitchen, not forgetting\nto throw a last glance at my grinder, who was trying his best to hide\nhis nervousness by puffing hard at his pipe and nearly choking in the\nattempt.\n\nSome ten or fifteen men were in this room, some of them busy preparing\nwork for the next day. Two were busy making artificial flowers; one\nwas working with copper wire, turning and twisting it into toasting\nforks, plate holders, and hangers to suspend flower pots. Two others\nwere in the rag and bone trade, for I had seen them when I first\nentered, overlooking their stuff in the backyard. One man was a\npedlar, for there was his pack, towards which he often turned his\neyes, in distrust of his company. One was a musician, for there,\nsticking out of the top pocket of his coat, was a common tin whistle.\n\"There,\" said I to myself, glancing at a man on my right hand--\"here\nis the only respectable working man among them all.\" This man had on a\nclean moleskin pair of trousers, a pilot cloth coat, and on his neck a\nlarge clean white muffler. \"Grinder?\" asked this man, catching my eye\nbefore I could avoid it. \"No,\" I answered, \"a pedlar.\" \"Oh,\" said he,\n\"I didn't notice you carrying a pack when you came in.\" Alas! my\nlittle stock could easily be carried in my pockets. \"No,\" I answered,\n\"as a rule I don't carry much stock.\" \"I shouldn't think you would,\"\nhe said, glancing at my leg, \"a bible ought to be enough for you, and\na good living too.\" Now it happened that when I left London, I had\nmade room in my pockets for two books which, up till that time, I had\nvery little opportunity of reading. One was the bible, and the other\nwas a small printed and cheap paper cover edition of Wordsworth. So,\nhearing this man mention a bible, I became extremely curious to learn\nhow a man could earn a living by carrying a book of this kind. Seeking\nthis information I said to this man--\"I shouldn't think that there was\nmuch money to be made by carrying a bible.\" \"Why not,\" he asked; \"if\nyou carry in your hand a decent rake (a comb), a flashy pair of sniffs\n(scissors) and a card of good links and studs--that is certainly a\ngood bible for a living; but there is not much profit in a pair of\nstretchers (laces) or a packet of common sharps (needles). As for me,\"\nhe continued, \"I am on the downright, and I go in for straight\nbegging, without showing anything in my hand. That grinder, whom I\nthought you were with, and am glad you are not, works very hard at\ndragging that old ricketty contrivance with him all over the country;\nand is he any better off than I am? I never fail to get the sixteen\nfarthings for my feather (bed), I get all the scrand (food) I can eat;\nand I seldom lie down at night but what I am half skimished (half\ndrunk), for I assure you I never go short of my skimish.\" Being\ncurious to see this man at work, and to hear the tales with which he\napproached people, I told him I would accompany him the next day as\nfar as Stratford, that was if he had no objection to my company, as I\nalso intended to visit that town before I made my way towards London.\nTo this proposal he seemed perfectly agreeable.\n\nThe next morning arrived and after having had breakfast, we set out.\nWe had scarcely set foot outside the lodging house, when I saw this\ndownrighter dodge in and out of shops with an astonishing alacrity,\nmore like a customer than a beggar; but with what success I could not\ntell. He seemed to go in smiling, and to come out the same, until we\nwere at last at the business end of the town. He did not confide in me\nas to his success or failure; but generously invited me to a smoke. We\nfilled our pipes, but just as I was about to strike a match, my\ncompanion interrupted me with--\"Wait until we are on the other side of\nthe sky pilot.\" Looking down the road I saw a clergyman approaching us\nat a fast rate, carrying something in his hand which proved on nearer\nview to be a book of prayers. When this black cloth was within three\nor four feet of us, my companion began to address him in a very\nserious voice, calling him in his ignorance, or perhaps,\nexcitement--\"your reverend highness.\" The gentleman in black cloth\nseemed to have been expecting something of this kind, for, without\nturning his head either to the right or left, he passed on, going if\npossible, at a greater speed. On seeing which my companion shouted in\na jeering voice--\"Go it, old hearty, and remember me in yer prayers.\"\nAs we proceeded on our way he laughed immoderately. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I\nhave always found a bible or a prayer book in a person's hand to be\nthe sign of an uncharitable disposition. Seldom do I get anything from\nthem, but I like to pester them. Now, if this had been a man with a\nbottle, or jug of beer in his hand, I would have had a civil answer at\nthe very least.\" The indifference of this reverend gentleman, and the\nexperience my companion seemed to have had of this kind in general,\nsurprised me not a little; for this man I was with certainly had the\nappearance of an honest working man of the better class; his clothes\nwere good, and his flesh was clean, and he certainly had not forgotten\nthe barber.\n\nMy companion allowed no person to pass us without making an appeal,\nand it was made apparent to me that he was successful in a number of\ncases. In times of failure people listened to this respectable looking\nfellow, and regretted that they had left home without having brought\ncoppers with them. At one time we saw a man who had dismounted to\nexamine his bicycle, probably having heard some part of it go click\nand fearing an accident, had paused for an investigation. We stood\nbefore this man, and my companion in straightforward, manly tones,\nasked him for assistance. The gentleman began to stammer, to hem and\nto haw, at the same time saying that he regretted that he was not at\nthat moment exactly in the position to----\"Friend,\" broke in my bold\ndownrighter, in a stern solemn voice, laying his heavy hand on the\nman's shoulder; \"friend, you see before you two men in extreme want,\nwho must be relieved in this very hour.\" We were standing in the man's\nway, and he could not possibly escape without knocking us over.\nApparently the man was afraid, for he first looked at our faces, and\nafter looking backward and then forward, he produced a silver\nsixpence, saying he trusted that that amount would be of some service\nto us. We made sure of this and then cleared ourselves from his path,\nallowing him space to mount and ride, an opportunity of which he\nquickly availed himself. This looked very much like highway robbery,\nbut strangely, I was better satisfied at this open independent way of\ntransacting business than by whining forth pitiful tales of want,\nhowever true they might be.\n\nWe were now entering the town of Stratford-on-Avon, and my companion\nwas advising me as to my behaviour at the common lodging house. \"It is\nthe only lodging house in the town,\" he said, \"and the old lady is\nvery particular and eccentric. Our very appearance may dissatisfy her,\nand then we will be compelled to walk some miles to the next town.\nShe keeps a shop attached to the lodging house,\" continued the\ndownrighter, \"and if strangers, not knowing this to be the case, when\napplying for lodgings, have bread, tea, sugar, meat, etc., in their\nhands, that is bought elsewhere, this eccentric old landlady declines\nto receive them as lodgers, and they are forced, often late at night,\nto walk to the next town. Some time ago,\" he continued, \"a lodger\nbought at her shop a half pound of cornbeef, which he thought was\nunderweight. Going to the public house opposite for a glass of beer,\nhe requested the publican to weigh this meat, which being done, it was\nfound to be two ounces short of the required weight. On returning to\nthe house this lodger went quietly to bed, but the next morning he\nspoke his mind to her in a very straightforward manner, making mention\nof the publican as a witness. Ever since that time, any man who visits\nthat public house is not allowed to sleep on her premises. If seen\nentering that place by day, they are objected to at night, and if seen\nvisiting that house after their beds are already paid for, on their\nreturn their money is at once refunded without the least explanation.\"\n\nIt certainly spoke highly for our respectable appearance when this\nparticular landlady received our money, and admitted us without much\nscrutiny into the kitchen; although she lost no time in following us\nthere, and stood for several minutes watching our movements. No doubt\nif one of us had thrown a match on the floor, or sat too near the\nfire; or complained that the kitchen only contained two tea pots,\ncracked and half spoutless, among the ten lodgers now patiently\nwaiting a chance to make tea; and that there were only three cups, and\none half rimmed plate like a vanishing moon--no doubt if we had\nuttered one complaint, our money would have been returned without\nadvice or warning, and we would have found no other lodgings that\nwould have answered our small means in the town. But we fortunately\nknew the old lady too well to implicate ourselves and we gave her no\nchance to complain.\n\nAfter tea I wandered alone about the town, and as I went here and\nthere in this enchanted place, ambition again took possession of me,\nstronger than ever. It filled me with vexation to think that I was no\nnearer my object, for I was, comparatively speaking, penniless. Two\nmonths had I wandered, during which time I had not been able to\nconcentrate my thoughts on any noble theme, taking all day to procure\nthe price of a bed, and two or three coppers extra for food. True I\nhad by now some three pounds saved, the income that I had not touched,\nbut at this rate, I would never be able to attain my ends. November\nwas here, and I was suddenly confronted with a long winter before me,\nand I pictured myself starved and snow bound in small out of the way\nvillages, or mercilessly pelted by hailstones on a wild shelterless\nheath. Side by side with these scenes I placed my ideal, which was a\nsmall room with a cosy fire, in which I sat surrounded by books, and I\nsickened at the comparison.\n\nThe following morning I was up and on my way before the downrighter\nhad put in an appearance. In two or three days I was again back on the\noutskirts of London, walking it round in a circle; sometimes ten miles\nfrom its mighty heart, or as far distant as twenty miles; but without\nthe courage to approach nearer, or to break away from it altogether.\nWhatever luck I had good or bad, I always managed to escape the\nworkhouse; and was determined to walk all night, if needs be, rather\nthan seek refuge in one of those places. One desperate hour possessed\nme every day, sometimes in the morning, or in the afternoon, but more\noften in the evening, when I would waylay people on the high roads, go\nboldly to the front doors of houses, interview men in their gardens,\nstables or shops at the same time flourishing before their eyes a whip\nof a dozen laces. In this hour I seemed to be impelled by a fatality\nlike that of the wandering Jew, cursed at having to perform something\nagainst my will. When this mad fit was at an end, during which I\ngenerally succeeded in getting a shilling or more, people might then\ncome and go without fear of being molested, for I was satisfied that\nthe workhouse was once more defeated for another night.\n\nOne morning at the beginning of December, I made up my mind to tramp\nhome for Christmas. This was a new idea, and not much to my liking,\nfor I had always written them hopeful letters, and although they knew\nthat I had left London, they knew nothing of my present condition. As\nusual, under these active impulses I made astonishing progress, being\non the borders of Wales in less than a week. The greater part of the\njourney accomplished, being now less than thirty miles from my native\ntown, I regretted having started with such an intention, and tramped\nover the Welsh Hills day after day, ultimately finding my way to\nSwansea. I did not remain long in that town, but began other rambles,\nand the day before Christmas eve, was in a town twenty-seven miles\nfrom home; sleeping there that night I rose early the following\nmorning and started for home. Keeping up a pace of three miles an\nhour, in spite of the one leg and the rough uneven roads of the hills,\nI accomplished the journey in nine hours, arriving home just after\ndark, without having once rested on the way.\n\nI had now been tramping for over three months and thought myself\nentitled to a little rest, if such could be had. After all, why had I\ndone this, and to what end had I suffered? For I would now draw the\nfew pounds that were due to me, would return to London in a week or\ntwo, and would again commence writing without any prospect of success,\nfor I would once more be living on a small income. And such was the\ncase: three weeks' comfort improved me wonderfully and vitality\nreturned stronger than ever after the low state into which it had\nfallen. What cut me to the heart was not so much that I had not\npractised writing during these four months, but that I had been forced\nto neglect reading and had therefore been taking in no means to\njustify my hopes in the future of being capable of writing something\nof my own. The poor man, who has his daily duties to perform, has his\nquiet evenings at home, with friends to lend him books, and being\nknown in the locality, a library from which to borrow them, but what\nprivileges has the wanderer?\n\nFeeling myself fit, I drew what money was due to me and returned to\nLondon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE FARMHOUSE\n\n\nYes, I returned to London, and to my surprise, began to look forward\nwith pleasure to be again frequenting the old haunts for which, when\nleaving I had felt so much disgust. This feeling seems to be natural;\nthat I felt inclined to see familiar faces, although they were red and\nblotchy with drink; to hear familiar voices, however foul their\nlanguage might be. Therefore, on the first night of my return wonder\nnot when I say that I was sitting comfortably in the Ark, as though I\nhad not slept one night away. I looked in vain for my old friend the\nCanadian. Many recognised and spoke to me. One in particular, a toy\nseller, who was curious to know where I had been. Seeing that he\nsuspected that I had been incarcerated in a jail, I told him something\nof my wanderings, and ended by making enquiries of him as to the\nwhereabouts of the Canadian. Of this man he knew nothing, but gave\ninformation that \"Cronje,\" the fish porter, another of my\nacquaintances, was staying at the Farmhouse, and no doubt would be\nglad to see me, he having been at the Ark to enquire of me during my\nabsence. Of course it was not my intention to stay long at the Ark, so\nI at once made my way to the Farmhouse, to see \"Cronje,\" where I found\nhim.\n\nThe Farmhouse is very particular about taking in strangers, which\ncertainly makes it a more desirable place than others of its kind;\nbut, at \"Cronje's\" recommendation, I was without much ceremony\naccepted as a lodger. This man, nicknamed \"Cronje,\" who had been for a\nnumber of years in Australia, and had so many wonderful anecdotes to\nrelate, was a sharp little man, the very image of a Jew in features,\nbut fair, red, always happy and laughing, for a contradiction. He was\nclean in his habits, extremely generous to the poorer lodgers, and was\nwell liked by all. It is true that many considered him to be a liar;\nbut no man contradicted him, for no man was capable of talking him\ndown. In his early days he had had a phenomenal voice, which he\nclaimed to have lost through auctioneering. As a rower he had defeated\nall comers on the river Murrumbidgee, and had publicly disgraced the\nchampion of Wagga Wagga at billiards. On seeing a man taking a hair\nout of his food, Cronje declaimed on the danger of swallowing this,\nrelating how his friend Skinner of Australia--who had taken down all\nthe best fencers of Europe--had swallowed a single hair which, taking\nroot in his stomach, had grown to such a length that it had killed\nhim before an operation could be performed. Again: hearing some one\nmention the names of two famous singers, one a tenor and the other\nbasso, Cronje, eager to create wonder, said that it was a most\nremarkable case that the tenor had at first become famous as a basso,\nand that the basso had at first received recognition as a tenor, and\nthat each man's voice had changed after he had become famous.\n\nWhat a strange house was this, so full of quaint characters. Some of\nthese men had been here for fifteen, and twenty years. \"Haymaker\"\nGeorge was here, and had been here for some time; for he claimed to\nhave gone haymaking from this very house, when he first came here;\ngoing and returning daily without the assistance of trains, busses or\ncars.\n\n\"Salvation\" Jimmy was here; who had been so emotional that he had been\ndesired as an acquisition to the Salvation Army, which he had joined,\nand donned the red jersey. At last the poor fellow had become so very\nemotional, probably influenced by such stirring music and the ready\nhallelujah of the members, that really, his frequent laughter, his\nfervent cries and his down-on-the-knees-and-up-in-a-trice, had\nprovoked so many smiles and sarcastic remarks from his audience, that\nnot only was he not promoted to rank from a private, but was\ndischarged the service altogether. Even to this day, he knew no reason\nfor his dismissal. He was mad enough now, in these later days,\nlaughing, dancing and singing up and down the Farmhouse kitchen, so\nthat I can imagine the effect on his nerves when marching to the sound\nof loud music, under the spread of a blood red banner. Even now, in\nthese days, he drew every one's attention to his eccentric behaviour,\nso that what must he have been then?\n\nI soon knew them all by name, that is, by their nicknames, by which\nmost of them preferred to be known. It was very interesting to hear,\nmorning after morning, \"Fishy Fat\" and John--the latter being in the\nlast stages of consumption, and poor fellow peevish withal--sit down\nto breakfast and to abolish the House of Lords. It was often a\nsurprise to me to see this noble edifice still standing, after hearing\nit abolished in such fierce language, and in terms of such scathing\nreproach. Strangely, these men had very little to say during the day;\nand did one get up earlier than the other in the morning, he would\nstand silent with his back to the fire, or pace quietly up and down\nthe kitchen waiting the appearance of his friend. When one saw the\nother preparing breakfast, he would at once follow his example and\nwhen everything was ready, both would seat themselves opposite each\nother at the same table. Up till this time nothing would have been\nsaid, until each had tasted and sugared his tea to his own liking.\nAfter this being done, one would suddenly ejaculate a sentence of this\nkind \"Smother them lazy rotters in the h'upper 'ouse, the bleeding\nliars.\" In accordance with that remark, the other would immediately\nanswer--\"Perish 'em all.\" And then would follow oath after oath of the\nblackest character, and daring cold-blooded designs that would have\ngladdened the heart of Guy Fawkes.\n\nBrown was also here, and always in a state of wonder. He had very\nlittle faith in print, and every hour things happened which made\nhim--to use his own words--\"know not what or what not to believe.\" He\npresumed that the laity was a certain kind of religious sect, but to\nhim they all seemed without difference. The only difference he could\nsee between a vicar and a curate was that one had a larger corporation\nand a redder nose than the other. Brown, who was a simple,\nkind-hearted fellow, said that we were all born of woman; that we were\nborn and that we must all die; that it was a great pity, and made his\nheart bleed, to see a man come down in life after he has been high up;\nand that we had to face a cruel fact--although it was almost beyond\nbelief--that a man's own relations often caused the man's downfall\nwhich, with his own eyes, he had seen done.\n\n\"Gambling\" Fred was here, looking over the daily paper with \"Red Nosed\nScotty.\" They are both short sighted, and, unfortunately, have but one\npair of spectacles between them, which is now being used by \"Scotty.\"\nSuddenly the red nosed man sees the name of a horse. \"There you are,\"\nhe cries exultingly; \"there's a sure winner.\" \"Where?\" asks his fellow\ngambler, taking the spectacles and adjusting them on his own nose.\n\"How can I show you now?\" asks the red nosed gambler, in a fretful\nvoice, \"haven't you got the specs on?\" At last matters are arranged to\nthe satisfaction of both, and Fred approaches his friend \"Yanks\" for\nthe loan of sixpence, to back this horse. But \"Yanks\" unceremoniously\ntells his friend to go to hell. At this the gambler sulks all the\nevening and unfortunately the next day his favoured horse wins. On\nthis transaction the gambler would have been ten shillings in pocket.\nAfter this another horse won, which Fred, in his penniless state,\nprofesses to have favoured. He would have backed this horse with his\nten shillings won from the other race, and would now have been five\npounds in pocket. \"Yes,\" says the gambler, pointing to his friend\n\"Yanks\"--\"that man has done me out of many a golden pound.\"\n\nPoor old \"Scotty\" Bill was here, a seller of fly papers; who disturbed\nthe kitchen all day, because of the scarcity of flies, as though the\nlodgers were to blame. \"We are having damn strange summers of late\nyears,\" he said, \"different from my younger days; for there is now\nscarcely a fly to be seen.\"\n\nHere dwelt \"Hoppy\" the bootblack, who had a rival in business on the\nopposite corner. He was certainly the dirtiest man I have ever seen\ngoing in and out of a house, but he earned good money, and often came\nhome drunk to this lodging house in a cab, causing a great sensation\namong the poorer lodgers. His rival did less trade, and could afford\nto do less, a lodger remarked, seeing that his mother kept a\nflourishing cats' meat shop. When I have passed near these rival\nbootblacks, I have often wondered how the thousands of people walked\ndaily between them without being singed, not to mention scorched, by\ntheir baneful glances, which were fired at each other across the way.\n\nHere too had \"Irish\" Tim come; a very small man with a sarcastic\ntongue; an out-of-date printer broken on the wheels of new machinery.\nDid you not want to be subjected to the ridicule of the kitchen it was\nnecessary when expressing an opinion, to look this man straight and\nsternly in the face, and to speak with the utmost deliberation. He\nalways sat at the same table, and in the same seat, if not already\noccupied; and his particular table was known as the House of\nParliament, owing to the number of arguments conducted there, of which\nhe was the leader. He passed judgment on public men, and although he\nrarely had a good word for any one, I must say, to Tim's credit, that\nhe never lost an opportunity to stroke the cat. I believe Tim had just\na little friendly feeling for simple, eccentric and impulsive Bob;\nwhom he could scorn and contradict without being threatened or bullied\nin return. Bob was an idealist, a dreamer with a strong imagination;\nand it was Tim's delight to beat this dreamer to the thorny paths of\nhis daily life, speaking in the name of common sense.\n\nBob was full of the wonders of Nature, marvelled much at the\nundertakings of men, to make railways to cross mountains and bridges\nto span canyons; and was deeply interested in the early growth of\nthings, ere they were manufactured into a form that every person could\nrecognise. He was a most brilliant conversationalist, and was\ninterestingly dramatic in his readings. He was a good companion for\nothers, but, as I soon discovered to my disappointment, seldom had a\ncomfortable moment when alone with himself. I had a small bedroom to\nmyself, and unfortunately the near cubicle to mine was Bob's. Bob,\nwho, probably five minutes before, had been in the kitchen laughing,\nor reading with childish delight of the gorgeous pageantry of a coming\nplay or pantomime, or had been seriously wondering at some new\ndiscovery, would scarcely set foot in his own quiet room ere he was\nclutched by a devil. I have become accustomed to foul language from\none man to another, but his bold way of directly addressing his\nblasphemy to his Maker, stiffened the laughter on my lips, and shocked\nme, in spite of an indifferent faith. This unusually clever man--a\ngenius, if this world ever had one--disappointed at his circumstances,\nafter an indulgence of his ideal, would sit on his bed and try to\nthrottle himself, night after night; and then would smother his face\nin his bed clothes, and invariably end his mad fit by sobbing. When he\nreached this pitiful state, this simple, impulsive and childlike man,\nI felt like standing to his side, before the outraged face of his\nMaker, so great was my pity for him.\n\nMany others were here, whom I was to become better acquainted\nwith--such as the \"Major,\" \"Australian\" Bill, \"Never Sweet,\"\n\"Cinders,\" and \"The Snob,\" who was sent to prison so often through\nhaving an over-liking for other people's pockets; and who, when\nquestioned as to his absence, always said he had been to see his\nyoungest brother. All of these were here, with many others of note.\n\nFor the \"Blacksmith\" was here, who, every time he saw me preparing to\ngo out, thought I must be on a begging expedition, and he trusted that\nI would find the ladies kindly disposed. On thanking him for this kind\nwish, he confided his intention of visiting Deptford, saying that he\nhad given that part of the city a long rest.\n\n\"Boozy\" Bob was here, \"Drunken Dave\" and \"Brummy Tom\"; three small men\nwith a large capacity for taking ale. All these men were quiet or at\nleast not objectionable, and none of them could disturb me in my room.\nThe sleep of the house was disturbed more from without than from any\ncause within. Cats--by day the most docile of God's creatures, every\none of them in the night enlisting under the devil's banner--took the\nplace by storm after the human voice had ceased. But perhaps the one\nwho accounted for more than two-thirds of my sleepless nights, was a\nwoman, an outsider living in an adjacent block. It was her custom to\ncome home drunk early in the morning, singing and swearing. \"Little\nPunch,\" a sickly consumptive, who had lived in this neighbourhood of\nSouthwark all his life, had no difficulty in recognising the voice of\nMrs. Kelly. So whenever I enquired as to the origin of a disturbance,\nthe name of Mrs. Kelly was the beginning and the end of it. Mrs. Kelly\nwas not satisfied with a single fight; she occasionally instigated a\nriot. On the night of that memorable day when Southwark, and in\nparticular the Borough, was visited by royalty, this was the lady that\nmurdered sleep. The police always appeared tolerant with her, and more\nso on this occasion. As a general rule it is people that live in\nprivate houses who have to complain of the presence of a common\nlodging house, of being disturbed by its low-class inmates; but this\nlodging house, with beds for nearly two hundred men, was kept as quiet\nas a large mansion with its one small family and half a score of\nservants. In its kitchen was a continual din up till twelve o'clock at\nnight; but this did not disturb the sleepers in other parts of the\nhouse. Seldom would a loud voice be heard inside; but it was nothing\nunusual to hear at night the fighting and swearing of men and women,\nand the screaming of children. This could be expected without fail on\nSaturday nights and the close of holidays. These horrible and inhuman\ncries so affected me on one Saturday evening, when, for the sake of\nthe study, I had retired early to bed, that I could neither think,\nsleep nor lie quiet, and felt compelled to get up and return to the\nkitchen. This I did, and found thirty or forty men assembled there,\nmost of them more or less drunk, but none of them appeared\nquarrelsome. Of course it was impossible to sit long here before I was\nsurrounded by them; and sat fearing to breathe deep enough to inhale\nthe fumes of drink which came from both their mouths and clothes; and\nbeing in good favour with these hopeless fellows, was continually\ninvited good naturedly to shake hands with them. Instead of going back\nto my room, I left the place and entered a public house for the first\ntime in three months. \"Brummy\" Tom was there, with another fish porter\nof his acquaintance. \"Have a drink with me,\" he said, \"I have often\nthought to ask you, but thought you were a teetotaller and would\nrefuse.\" \"'Brumm,'\" I said, rather bitterly, \"a teetotaller who lives\nin a common lodging house is to be heartily despised, for he shows\nhimself to be satisfied with his conditions.\" With \"Brummy\" Tom and\nhis friend for companions, I took a number of long sleeping draughts,\nand just after twelve o'clock that night was fast asleep in bed. The\nfollowing morning some of the lodgers were telling of murder cries\nheard just after midnight, but I praised the power of Bacchus that I\nhad not heard them.\n\nIt was always a mystery to me that these men respected me and never\nfailed in civility in their dealings with me, for I did everything\nthat these men disliked. I wore a white collar, which they at once\ntake to be a challenge that you are their superior. Few other men in\nthe house, except they were fighting men, could have produced a\ntoothbrush without being sneered at. True it induced Brown to ask the\nquestion whether I felt any actual benefit from cleaning my teeth;\nthat he had heard so many different opinions that he did not know what\nor what not to believe; saying that he had often watched me, and\nwondered at so unusual a custom. They all detested the \"Masher,\"\nbecause he was earning more than a pound a week on a good paper stand,\nand was also in receipt of a good pension; and they all cried shame on\nhim for living in a common lodging house. This man, to my discomfort,\nshowed so much inclination to confide in me, pointing out the\ndifferent lodgers who owed him money, and calling them low vagabonds\nand ungrateful scamps, in a voice that was not meant to be a whisper,\nthat I was almost afraid of losing their good will in listening to\nsuch words, without saying something on their behalf. Again I was\nalmost a teetotaller, and that was the worst charge of all. In spite\nof all this, I do not believe that I made one enemy, and am certain\nthat I never received other than kindness and civility from the\nlodgers of the Farmhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nRAIN AND POVERTY\n\n\nThe greatest enemy to the man who has to carry on his body all his\nwardrobe, is rain. As long as the sun shines he is indifferent, but if\nhe is caught in a wet condition after sunset he is to be pitied. He\ndoes not fear any ill consequences to health from being wet through,\nas does his more fortunate brother, but he does not like the\nuncomfortable sensation of shivering and not being able to keep warm.\nThis unsettled feeling is often made worse by an empty stomach. In\nfact a full stomach is his one safeguard against the cold, and he\ncares not then if the rain and the wind penetrate his clothes. No\nseaman ever searched the heavens for a dark speck, or astronomer for a\nnew light, as does this homeless man for a sign of rain. To escape\nfrom the coming deluge he seeks shelter in the public library, which\nis the only free shelter available; and there he sits for hours\nstaring at one page, not a word of which he has read or, for that\nmatter, intends to read. If he cannot at once get a seat, he stands\nbefore a paper and performs that almost impossible feat of standing\nupright fast asleep, so as to deceive the attendants, and respectable\npeople who are waiting a chance to see that very paper. To be able to\ndo this requires many unsuccessful efforts, which fail on account of\nhard breathing, nodding and stumbling against the paper stand; but\nsuccess has at last been attained, and there he stands fast asleep and\napparently absorbed in a most interesting paragraph. He attains such\nperfection in this one act that he has been known to stand like a\nmarble statue before a large sheet of costly plate glass, what time\nsleep had overpowered him in the act of admiring a baker's art. The\nhomeless man must always remember one thing, that though he may sit on\nwooden seats and stone parapets, eat in public and go in rags, he must\nnot, on any account, sleep. Working men only are allowed that\nprivilege and those who can afford to remain idle. No policeman would\nthink of indulging in a short nap until he made sure that there was no\nvagrant sleeping on his beat. And what respectable householder could\nrest in bed knowing that a tramp was sleeping in his doorway? If\nnecessity is the mother of invention, sleep must certainly be\nnecessary to a human being, or the tramp, according to his many\nchances of experiments, would be the first to prove the contrary. So\nmuch for the very lowest men.\n\nBut there are others who, in that they have a shelter at night, scorn\nthe name of being called homeless men. These men live in common\nlodging houses, and are well satisfied with a place to sleep and\nenough food to keep body and soul together. Most of these men earn\ntheir living, such as it is, in the open air, and they earn so little\nthat they are seldom prepared for a rainy day. Therefore, when comes\nthis rainy morn, and the poor fellow rises penniless from his bed, it\nis then that you see a little seriousness come over him; for he cannot\nexpose his wares to spoil in the rain and, did they not spoil, who\nwould be foolish enough to tarry in bad weather to make an idle\npurchase? The rain would spoil his paper-toys, his memorandum-books,\nor his laces and collar studs. In truth, as long as the rain continues\nhis occupation is gone. The paper seller can take his stand regardless\nof weather, and earn enough for the day thereof, at the expense of a\nwet skin. Sometimes he is fortunate enough to be stationed near some\nshelter, but sometimes his stand happens to be outside an aristocratic\nclub or hotel, and he dare not enter its porch, not even if the devil\nwas at his heels.\n\nThen there is the \"downrighter,\" the man who makes no pretence to\nselling, but boldly asks people for the price of his bed and board. On\na rainy day he has to make sudden bursts between the heaviest showers\nand forage the surrounding streets, which, being near a lodging house,\nare invariably poor and unprofitable, whereas his richest pastures are\nin the suburbs or better still the outskirts of them. The bad weather\nis, of course, a blessing to those distant housekeepers, however hard\nit is on the \"downrighter,\" for it comes as the Sabbath day to their\nbells and knockers.\n\nThen there are the market men who work two or three early hours in the\nmorning, when the majority of people are asleep. These men are\nreturning in their wet clothes between eight and nine o'clock and\ntheir day's work is done. Often they have no change of clothing,\ntherefore it is not unusual for two men to be standing at the same\nfire, the one drying his wet socks and the other toasting his dry\nbread, with the articles in question almost embracing one another on\nthe most friendly terms.\n\nIt is on this rainy day that one sees those little kindnesses which\nare only seen among the very poor: one who has not sufficient for\nhimself assisting some other who has nothing. One man who has made\neighteen pence at the market, returns, pays fourpence for his bed,\nbuys food, and then in addition to paying for another man's bed,\ninvites yet another to dine with him and in the end gives his last\ncopper to another. One, who happens to have done well the previous\nday, gives here and there until he is himself penniless. The\nconsequence of all this is that whereas you saw in the morning dull\nand anxious faces, at midday you see more than half of the lodgers\ncooking, their beds already paid for. All worry is at an end, and\nthey are whistling, humming songs, or chaffing one another.\n\nIt is on this rainy day when they are made prisoners without spare\nmoney to pay into the beer house, that they mend and wash their\nclothes, repair their boots, and have abundant time to cook\nvegetables. It is a day for Irish stews and savoury broths.\n\nIt was on one of these days, when the kitchen was so crowded, that I\nunfortunately attempted to make pancakes. I knew that such an unusual\nexperiment could not fail to cause a sensation which I did not desire,\nso I placed myself in a dark corner and quietly and without being\nobserved, made the flour into paste, exactly as I had seen another\nlodger do some time previous. The flour had been in my possession ever\nsince that occasion, but my courage had up to the present failed.\nThree or four men were now at the stove, and a number of others were\nidly walking up and down. I had made half a basin of paste, and this\nwas to make one big thick fat pancake. But how was I to get it into\nthe frying pan without attracting notice? I covered the basin with a\nsaucer, placed the frying pan on the stove, with butter therein, and\nwaited my chance. I had taken the precaution of having in readiness a\nlarge plate. At last my chance came, for two cooks were having high\nwords as to whether cabbage should be put into cold or boiling water.\nOthers joined in this argument, so without receiving notice, I dropped\nthe paste into the frying pan and quickly covered it with a large\nplate. So far, so good: my only difficulty now would be to turn it;\nfor after it was cooked I could carry the pan and its covered contents\nto the dark corner where I intended to dine; and where, although men\nmight see me eat, none would be the wiser as to what I was eating.\nFive minutes had passed and no doubt its one side was cooked. The\nargument was still in full swing, for each man stoutly maintained his\nopinions, and almost every man who took part cited his mother or\nsister as an authority, except one, who proudly mentioned a French\nchef in an Australian gold diggings. Now was my chance. I cast one\nfurtive glance around, rose the hot plate with a stocking, which I had\nbeen washing, made one quick turn of the wrist, spun the pancake in\nthe air, caught it neatly and promptly, clapped the plate over it--the\nwhole process done, I believe, in less than ten seconds. The\ndifficulty was now over and I breathed relief. I went to my dining\ncorner and sat down, intending to fetch the pancake in five minutes\ntime.\n\nThree minutes perhaps I had been seated when I heard a loud voice\ncry--\"Whose pancake is this burning on the stove?\" How I did detest\nthat man: he was always shouting through the kitchen--\"Whose stew is\nthis boiling over?\" or \"Whose tea is stewing on the fire?\" The man\nalways seemed to be poking his nose into other people's business. I\ndid not think it worth while drawing every one's attention by\nanswering him, but made my way as quietly as possible towards the\nstove. Alas! the idiot, not thinking that I was the owner of the\npancake, and was then on my way to attend to it, shouted the second\ntime, louder, and it seemed to me, too impatiently--\"Whose pancake is\nthis?\" If I was vexed when I heard that second enquiry, imagine how I\nfelt when every lodger in the kitchen, not seeing or hearing from the\npancake's lawful claimant, began to shout in angry voices, \"Whose\npancake is that burning on the fire?\" My own patience was now\nexhausted. \"The pancake is mine,\" I said, \"and what about it? What is\nall this fuss about? It is the first pancake I have ever attempted to\nmake and by heavens! if it is to cause such a stir as this, it will be\nthe last.\" But while I was making this speech another voice, which\nfroze the blood in my veins cried angrily--\"Whose pancake is this?\" It\nwas a woman's voice, it was the Mrs. of the house; and I now knew that\nsomething more serious was happening than the burning of a pancake--I\nwas burning her frying pan. If I dallied in respect to my pancakes, I\nmust certainly not make further delay in saving the frying pan. To her\nI at once apologised, but I gave that meddler a look that for ever\nagain kept him silent as to what belonged to me. Such are the doings\nin a lodging house, vexatious enough at the time, but amusing to\nrecall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nFALSE HOPES\n\n\nThe Farmhouse was under the management of an Irishman and his wife. He\nwith a generous heart that always kept him poor, for he often assisted\nlodgers towards paying for their beds, who, I am sorry to say, were\nsometimes ungrateful in return. She, more circumspect, but kind\nhearted and motherly where she thought the case to be a deserving one.\n\nWith regards to literary ambition I always kept my own counsel,\nconfiding in one man only--\"Cronje\"; a man to be relied on, whose\nsympathetic ears were always open to receive either good or bad news.\n\nI must have been in this house something like twelve months, when I\ntook a sudden notion to send some work to a literary man, asking him\nfor his opinion of the same. In a few days I received a letter stating\nthat want of time prevented him from passing judgment on my work,\nwhich he regretted he would have to return unread. This did not offend\nme in the least, although I was greatly disappointed, for I knew that\na man in his position could have little time to spare, and no doubt\nwas pestered with correspondence of a like nature. But, unfortunately,\nthe MS. returned in an ill condition, having been roughly handled\nthrough the post, and arrived at the Farmhouse with the ends of the\nenvelope in tatters. When I received this ragged and disreputable\nparcel from the Manager, I knew that the cat was out of the bag, and\nthat the secret which I had guarded so jealously was now the property\nof another, but I made no confession, thinking that he would broach\nthe subject, which he did on the following morning. On enquiring if\nthe parcel I had received on the day previous was a manuscript, I lost\nno time in telling him everything. The upshot of this was that he\npersuaded me to send some work to a publisher, and if that gentleman\nthought the book worth publication, he, the Manager, had no doubt that\none of the many rich people who were connected with the Farmhouse\nMission could be induced to assist me. Hearing this I was sorry that I\nhad not confided in him of my own accord, for I had often seen these\nrich people coming and going, looking, perhaps for deserving cases.\n\nWith these golden projects before me, I again set to work, and, in\nless than a month, the MS. was ready and in the hands of a publisher.\nThat gentleman wrote in a few days saying that he thought there was\nliterary merit, and that the cost of production would be thirty\npounds. The publisher's name was well known, and the Manager was quite\nsatisfied as to its being a genuine offer from an old and respectable\nfirm. Quite contented in my own mind, my part having been performed\nwithout difficulty, I gladly allowed this man to take possession of\nthis correspondence, and a few specimen books of verse, which the\npublisher had sent with it, and, having full trust in the man's\ngoodness and influence, made myself comfortable, and settled down in a\nfool's paradise. I have never had cause to doubt his goodness, but he\ncertainly overrated his power to influence the philanthropists on the\nbehalf of a lodger.\n\nSeveral weeks passed, and I had received no encouraging news. No\nmention had been made of my affairs, and I gave myself over to the\ninfluence of the coke fire. After going out in the morning for two or\nthree hours, I would return at midday, often earlier, and sit\nhopelessly before this fire for ten or eleven hours, after which I\nwould retire to my room. What a miserable time was this: the kitchen,\nfoul with the breath of fifty or sixty men, and the fumes of the coke\nfire, took all the energy out of a man, and it was a hard fight to\nkeep awake. It has taken the play out of the kitten, and this small\nanimal lies stretched out, overcome by its fumes, without the least\nfear of being trodden on. Sometimes, when I endeavoured to concentrate\nmy mind, with an idea of writing something, it was necessary to feign\na sleep, so that these kind hearted fellows might not disturb me with\ntheir civilities. On these occasions it was not unusual for me to fall\ninto a real sleep. And, when I awoke, it sickened me to think of this\nwasted time; for I was spending in bed more hours than were necessary\nfor my health, and it was a most cruel waste of time to be sleeping in\nthe day. This fire exerted a strange influence over us. In the morning\nwe were loath to leave it, and we all returned to it as soon as\npossible. Even the books and magazines in the libraries could not\nseduce me longer than an hour. There was one seat at the corner of a\ntable, which I have heard called \"the dead man's seat.\" It was within\ntwo yards of this great fire, which was never allowed to suffer from\nwant of coke. It was impossible to retain this seat long and keep\nawake. Of course, a man could hardly expect to keep this seat day\nafter day for a long winter, and to be alive in the spring of the\nyear. This was the case with a printer who, unfortunately, had only\nthree days' work a week. The amount he earned was sufficient for his\nwants, so, in his four idle days, he would sit on this seat, eating,\nreading, but more often sleeping, until before the end of the winter,\nhe was carried away a dying man. Some of these lodgers claim to be\nable to recognise in the public streets any strangers who are\nsuffering from this coke fever.\n\nWeeks passed and then months, and I still heard nothing about my book.\nThe Manager had failed, of that I at last became certain. I avoided\nhim as much as possible, because of the confidence I had reposed in\nhim. It was certainly very awkward for the both of us, and I felt much\nsympathy on his account. When he was near I felt extremely\nuncomfortable, and I am sure he felt none too easy in my presence.\n\nSpring at last came, and I broke away from the lodging house fire, to\nindulge in the more pure rays of the sun. I began to absent myself\nfrom the house longer every day, until I at last began to regret that\nthere was any necessity to return to it at all. The happiness and stir\nof Nature, at this time of the year, began to fill me with her own\nenergy. I was in my room, one of these bright mornings, and was\nlooking in the mirror, adjusting my scarf--the mirror and bed being\nthe whole furniture. In this mirror I looked long enough to see a\nwhite hair on the side of my head. Thinking this to be hardly true at\nmy time of life, I shifted the glass to a better light, thinking it\nmust have played me false; but sure enough, here it was--a single\nhair, as white as snow. Yes, I thought, with some bitterness, this\ncomes of waiting to be fulfilled the promises of other people; and you\nwill never rise if you do not make some effort of your own. Thinking\nof this white hair, I left the house, wondering what I could do to\nhelp myself. And, this particular morning, an idea occurred to me, so\nsimple, so reasonable, and so easily to be accomplished, that it\nfilled me with surprise that such a plan had not presented itself\nbefore. I had an income of eight shillings per week; then what was to\nprevent me from borrowing forty or fifty pounds, even though I paid\nfor it a little more than usual interest? Again I was full of hope and\nhappiness, for I could see nothing to prevent the accomplishment of\nthis. My eight shillings were being received in sums of two pounds\nevery five weeks. Two shillings a week were forwarded home, and I\nlived abstemiously on the remainder. My five weeks' money was due on\nthe following week, so I at once began making preparations for a trip\nhome. When this money arrived I determined to lose no time in\nexecuting these plans, for I had visions of being a white headed man,\nif I remained under these hopeless conditions for another year or two.\nThe money came on Saturday night, when it was due, and everything\nbeing prepared, I was that very night on my way to Paddington Station,\nafter having told the manager that I was going home for a week, and\nthat I would forward him my rent, if I remained longer than that time.\nFull of this idea I arrived at home.\n\nThe following Monday I invaded the office of my old granny's lawyer,\nand telling him I wished to set up in business, consulted him as to\nthe best way of borrowing the money, some forty or fifty pounds being\nnecessary. He saw nothing to prevent this from being done, but\nstrongly advised me not to do so; \"at any rate,\" he said, \"see your\ntrustee, ask him if he can lend you the amount, and, if he cannot see\nhis way clear to do so, let me know!\" In half an hour I was with the\ntrustee. That gentleman had not the amount on hand, but had plans of\nhis own which, if I strictly adhered to, would be more to my advantage\nin the long run.\n\n\"It is now June,\" he said, \"and if you allow your income to stand\nuntil the beginning of the New Year, you will then have ten pounds\nsaved to your account, and I give you my promise to advance another\ntwenty pounds without a question of interest, making the amount thirty\npounds!\" Now it happened that three weeks before I left London, I had\nsent a work to a printer and publisher, who had priced two hundred and\nfifty copies at nineteen pounds; so that I knew well that thirty\npounds would be ample to meet all expenses. But how was I to live for\nthe next six months? Determined to make any sacrifice to attain this\nend, I closed with the trustee's offer, and, getting an advance from\nhim of one pound, intended to return at once to London, but was\npersuaded to remain at home for another three weeks. At the end of\nthis time I paid my fare back to London, and again took possession of\nmy room, for which I had forwarded the rent during my absence. In\nless than four days after my return, I was very near penniless, and\nsaw no other prospect than to start on another half year's wandering.\n\nHow foolish all this was! Why did I not start my travels from home,\ninstead of wasting money on a return fare to London? Why did I pay\nthree weeks' rent for the sake of returning to a room for as many\ndays? Well, I had a faint hope that the Manager might, at last, after\nsix months, have succeeded in his attempt.\n\nI told the Manager that I was going on the road for a month or two,\nbut mentioned no purpose, for I was now resolved to act for myself.\n\n\"You will always find room at the Farmhouse,\" he said; \"do not doubt\nthat.\"\n\nTrying to appear as cheerful as possible, for I knew this man was also\ndisappointed, I left him, determined never to set foot in that house\nagain until I could dispense with the services of others. At this time\nI had two silver shillings and some odd coppers, and would soon need\nassistance as a man, without any question as to my work as an author.\n\nAgain I was leaving London, not knowing how much I would have to\nsuffer. One idea consoled me not a little; that I would not require\nmoney for a bed for at least three months to come; that the nights,\nthough cold, would not be so dangerous as to kill. Whatever the\nconsequence might be, even if this rough life threatened to injure my\nhealth permanently, I was firmly resolved to sacrifice the next six\nmonths for whatever might follow them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nON TRAMP AGAIN\n\n\nNOW followed a strange experience, an experience for which there is no\nname; for I managed to exist, and yet had neither the courage to beg\nor sell. Certainly at times I was desperately inclined to steal; but\nchance left nothing for my eyes to covet, and I passed harmlessly on.\nWhen I suffered most from lack of rest, or bodily sustenance--as my\nactual experience became darker, the thoughts of the future became\nbrighter, as the stars shine to correspond with the night's shade.\n\nI travelled alone, in spite of the civilities of other tramps, who\ndesired company, so as to allow no strange voice to disturb my dreams.\nSome of these men had an idea that I was mad, because I could give\nthem little information as to the towns and villages through which I\nhad that very day passed. They enquired as to the comforts and\nconditions of a town's workhouse, of which I knew nothing, for I had\nnot entered it. They enquired as to its best lodging house, of which I\nwas again ignorant, having slept in the open air. They enquired how\nfar I had come that day, which I could not immediately tell them; and\nthey were curious to know how far I was going, which I did not know.\nThe strangest part of this experience was that I received help from\npeople without having made a glance of appeal, and without having\nopened my mouth. When I asked for water, tea or milk was often\nbrought, and food invariably followed. I began to look on this as a\nshort life of sacrifice, killing a few worthless hours so as to enjoy\nthousands of better ones; and I blessed every morning that ushered in\na new day, and worshipped every Sabbath night that closed another\nweek.\n\nAfter tramping from town to town, from shire to shire, in two months I\nwas in Devonshire, on my way to Plymouth. I felt continually attracted\nto these large centres of commerce, owing, I suppose, to feeling the\nnecessity of having an object in view; but was generally starved out\nof them in a very short time. A gentleman on horseback, whom I met\nnear Totnes, saved me from suffering from want, for a couple of days,\nat least, when I would reach Plymouth. This gentleman drew his horse\nto a halt, so that he might enquire my destination. He seemed to be\nmuch surprised when I told him it was the town of Plymouth.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he said, glancing towards the ground, \"there is only one\nfoot to get sore, if that is any consolation to you; perhaps this\nwill help you a little on the way,\" dropping into my hand three silver\nshillings.\n\nWithout having this case in mind, I certainly fared better in\nDevonshire than in other counties, and found its people more like the\nprosperous settlers in new lands. In spite of this, my roughest\nexperience was in this county, owing to the inclemency of the weather,\nand the difficulty of finding shelter. One night I had gone into the\nfields, and, getting together a dozen or more wheatsheaves, proceeded\nto build a house of them, making a dry floor on the damp earth, with\nwalls to shelter from the wind, and a roof to shelter from the dew,\nleaving just space enough at one end to admit my body. I had been in\nhere comfortable and warm for some time, when it began to rain. In\nhalf an hour the rain leaked in large drops through the roof, and in\nless than an hour these drops had become streams. There was nothing to\ndo but to remain, for it was now too dark to seek shelter. For ten\nhours it rained incessantly, and I was literally wet to the skin, and\nno drier than a person immersed in water--not wet to the skin as\npeople commonly express it when they are damp after a few showers. I\nwas nothing daunted, looking on this as one of the many hard\nexperiences that I was compelled to undergo. The next morning I chose\na secluded spot in the open air, so as to lie down where the sun,\ncoming out warm and strong, would dry me while I slept. Two or three\ntimes have I suffered in this way, but have never felt any ill effects\nafter.\n\nMy worst experience of this kind was in the adjoining county of\nSomerset, at the end of September, when I was again making my way back\nto London. But it was not the blowing of the wind, or the patter of\nthe rain; not the rustle of the leaves on the swaying branches; not\nthe discomforts of having wet clothes, and being without sign of a\nbarn or empty house in which to shelter; it was none of these that\ntook the courage out of me: it was a wild laugh, harsh, and apparently\nin savage mockery. I had skirted what appeared to be a park, for\nsomething like two miles, and was weary to see the end of it. This at\nlast seemed to come, for I could see through the trees a large open\nfield wherein were wheatsheaves, stacked in their threes, and in their\nusual rows. Now, had this been a field right up to the roadside, I\nwould most certainly have had no compunction in spending the night\nthere, being tired of carrying such a distance my wet and heavy\nclothes. As it was, I paused, not feeling inclined to proceed further\non my journey, and yet not half liking to cross that narrow strip of\npark, thinking it might contain game that would be well looked after,\nmaking trespassing a serious offence. When in this irresolute state of\nmind, I caught sight of a white gate, and a small footpath leading to\nthe field. Night seemed to be coming on at the rate of a darker shade\nto the minute, and I knew well that in another quarter of an hour it\nwould be difficult to distinguish a house from a barn. Seeing this, I\nsummoned courage, opened the gate, and made my way quickly along the\npath that led to the wheatsheaves. Standing amidst these I waited\nsilently, listening for any that might be in that locality. Satisfied\nthat there were not, I picked up a sheaf, and was about to lay it\nflat, when I heard a loud startling laugh, coming from the direction\nof the road. Dropping the sheaf at once, I bent low, not for a moment\ndoubting but what some one had seen me from the road, and was taking a\nheartless delight in letting me know his discovery. Although I\nregretted this, thinking he would inform others, and I would surely be\ndisturbed before morning, perhaps that very hour--I determined to\ntravel no further that night, if I could help it, and proceeded to\nmake my bed, under the impression that he had passed on. I stood up in\nfull, but had scarcely done so, when my appearance was greeted by\nseveral long shouts of derisive laughter. Now, a homeless man has no\ntime to be superstitious, he fears the living and not the dead. If he\nis sleepy he is not particular about feeling in the darkness of\ncellars or vaults; and, if he were sleeping on a grave, and was\nawakened by a voice crying--\"Arise from off this grave,\" he would at\nonce think it the voice of a grave digger, or the keeper of the\ncemetery, rather than the ghostly owner of the same. Therefore, I had\nnot the least idea but what this was the voice of a human being,\nalthough it sounded uncanny and strange. I moved again, and again\nheard that loud peal of laughter. This voice evidently only mocked\nwhen I moved, for when I stood still, not a sound was to be heard.\nThis time I gave up all thoughts of making a bed, and being now filled\nwith fear, picked up the thick stick with which I travelled, and stood\non the defensive, every moment expecting to see a madman burst from\nunder the trees and in three leaps and a bound be at my side. These\nmovements seemed to cause some merriment, but the laughter again\nceased when I stood watching and waiting, and puzzled how to act. Rest\nwas now out of the question, and I made up my mind to leave that\naccursed place instantly. With this intention I made my way towards\nthe gate. I had scarcely moved in that direction, when the laughing\nbegan, this time continuing for a long time, as though jeering its\nlast at my defeat. When I reached the gate, and passed through to the\nopen road, my courage returned, and I looked with some bitterness to\nsee the figure of some country lout hurrying into the darkness, after\nsucceeding in robbing me of my sleep; but, to my surprise, I heard no\none, and could see no figure on the road before or behind. It was now\nthat superstition took hold of me, and I got off with all possible\nspeed, often looking back to see if I was pursued; and I did not stop\nuntil a human settlement lay between me and that accursed park. Often\nhave I thought of that night. It is natural to suppose that a\nthoughtless ploughman, or farm labourer, would have stood at the\nroadside and laughed or shouted once or twice, and then passed on, but\nit is scarcely probable that he would have remained there to carry his\njoke so far. Granted that he had had the courage to laugh so many\ntimes, taunting one at a distance, where was his courage now that he\nhad run away, or still stood concealed behind the trees? The voice\nsounded human, but still seemed wild and a little unnatural. After\nmuch consideration the only conclusion I could put to the affair was\nthat the voice came from a bird in the trees; an escaped pet bird that\ncould imitate the human voice. This solution of the mystery did not\naltogether satisfy me, for I have never had cause to believe that any\nbird could so perfectly imitate the human voice. Superstition must\nhave thoroughly possessed me for the once in my life, or I should not\nhave walked all night, after the painful exertion of the day.\n\nIf I settled towards night time in any place where a bird came hopping\nrestlessly from branch to branch, making a series of short cries of\nfear, to let me know that I was lying too close to its nest, I would\nwithout hesitation shift my position, often to my own discomfort; but\nat the same time, people could pass to and fro to my indifference.\n\nI would never beg, unless forced to the last extremity, for I feared\nthe strange fascination that arises from success, after a man has once\nlost his shame. On one occasion I saw a well dressed couple wheeling\ntheir bicycles up an incline, which was too steep to ride. Evidently\nthey were lovers, for they seemed to be in no hurry to reach the top\nof the hill and end their conversation by riding. As I drew near the\nlady produced her purse, and, placing something in her companion's\nhand, motioned over her shoulder in my direction. On which the\ngentleman nodded, and immediately glanced back towards me. Now, these\npeople could not very well make the first overtures, for the simple\nreason that they know not whether a man is in want, or is a poor, but\nproud and respectable inhabitant of one of the adjacent villages. I\npreferred to impress them with the latter opinion, for, when I reached\nthem, I put on an extra spurt, and was soon beyond their hearing. No,\nI would never make a good beggar, for here was money in readiness, to\ncome at the sound of my voice, or to be drawn by the simple side\nglance of my eye. When I was some distance away, I looked back, and\nsaw the lady looking rather disappointed, receiving back her coin. Her\ncompanion was laughing, no doubt consoling her by saying that I was\nhardly likely to be in actual need, or I would have asked for\nassistance, and probably my home was somewhere near. The truth of the\nmatter was that at this time I had not a copper to bless myself with.\n\nDays, weeks, and months went on, and it was now the month of October.\nIt was now that I began to find the necessity of having a bed every\nnight, having been satisfied up till then with a bed once or perhaps\ntwice a week, according to the coppers received. I was back again in\nSwindon, having been there some time previous, when on my way to\nDevonshire. The first three months of sacrifice were over, and I was\nvery little the worse for it; but the next three months required\ndifferent means, to correspond with the difference in the time of\nyear. Shelter was necessary every night, and to meet these stern\ndemands, I needed something to sell, so as to be sure of coppers for\nthis purpose. With this idea, I bought two dozen laces with the last\nthree coppers I had, and re-opened business as a hawker. The success\nwith which I met in this town astonished me, owing, I believe, to its\nbeing a working man's town, and not filled with half-pay officers and\nwould-be aristocrats that cannot afford, but still feel it their duty,\nto live in fine villas in the locality of a royal residence. The poor,\nsympathetic people seemed to understand a man's wants. Business was\noften transacted without the utterance of words. Taking a pair of\nlaces, they would give a copper, and, smiling their sympathy, close\nthe door. Often one would pay for these useless things and not take\nthem. The kindness of these people so filled me with gratitude, that I\nfound it impossible to continue selling after I had received enough to\nsupply the day's wants, which would often be in less than half an\nhour. I remained here for two weeks, being able to allow myself half\nan ounce of tobacco and a halfpenny paper every day. The only thing\nthat worried me in this town was the persistence of an old beggar in\nthe lodging house. Night after night, this man would advise me to go\nout and stand pad. This was, he explained, that a man, who is\nafflicted with the loss of an arm, a hand or a leg, blind, paralysed\nor lame, should stand or sit in a public place in the town, holding in\nhis hand matches, laces or any other cheap trifle, so that he might\ninvite the charity of passers by. This old man could not understand\nwhy this was not done, seeing that it required no eloquence--the very\nact and the affliction speaking for themselves--and was so successful\na dodge that even able-bodied men could often pick up a shilling or\ntwo in this way. At last I became so impressed with this old man's\neloquence, that I left the lodging house three times in one night with\na firm resolution to stand pad, and three times I returned without\nhaving done so. On the last occasion I did make a little attempt, but\nfoolishly took up a position where no one could see me.\n\nBefore I left Swindon I wrote to a friend of mine in Canada,\nrequesting him to forward me a pound to London, as soon as possible,\nwhich would be returned to him at the beginning of the new year. I did\nthis so that I might have a couple of weeks at the end of December to\nprepare my MS. and to be ready for business as soon as that time\narrived. It was now the latter end of October, and this pound could\nnot reach London far short of a month. Thinking I was not likely again\nto suffer for want of a bed or food, after this success in Swindon, I\nbought a good stock of laces and left that town, with the intention of\nworking the towns on the outskirts of London, so that when ready to\nenter I would be within a day's march. Unfortunately, after leaving\nSwindon, success deserted me, which was certainly more my fault than\nthat of the people, for I made very little appeal to them. Arriving at\nMaidenhead, I had the bare price of my bed, with a dry bread supper\nand breakfast. My laces were being exhausted, and I was without means\nto replenish them. From town to town I walked around London, sometimes\nmaking sixpence, and always less than a shilling a day; and this small\namount had to purchase bed, food, and occasionally a couple of dozen\nlaces. The monotony of this existence was broken a little at\nGuildford, where I was arrested on suspicion of crime. A plain clothes\nofficer happened to be in the office of the lodging house, who, when\nhe set eyes upon me, requested a few moments conversation, at the same\ntime leading the way out into the yard. He then came to a halt under a\nlamp, and, taking from his pocket some papers, began to read, often\nraising his eyes to scrutinise my person. \"Yes,\" he said, at last, \"no\ndoubt you are the man I want, for you answer his description.\" \"I\nsuppose,\" was my answer, \"it is a case of arrest?\" \"It is,\" he said,\n\"and you must accompany me to the station.\" On my way to that place he\nasked many a question of what I had done with my overcoat, and as to\nthe whereabouts of my wife. It had been several years since I had\nowned the former, and the latter I had never possessed; but this man\ncould not be convinced of either. \"Which way have you come?\" he asked.\nTo which I mentioned one or two shires. At this he pricked up his\nears, and asked if I had been in a certain town in one of those\nshires, which I had, and saw no reason to say otherwise. Unfortunately\nthis was the town where the guilty man had operated. The detective was\ncertainly not very smart when he took this confession as evidence of\nguilt, for the guilty man would have mentioned that particular town as\none of the last places to visit. I certainly answered to the\ndescription of the man wanted, with the exception of not having a\nblotchy face, which had been characteristic of the guilty man. But on\nmy face they saw no blotches, nor signs of any having been there in\nthe past. Of course, I was discharged in an hour, and returned to the\nlodging house for the night. The following day I happened to be in\nDorking, and was walking through that town, when I heard quick steps\nbehind me, and a voice cry--\"Halt: I want you.\" Turning my head I saw\nit was a police officer. This man at once took possession of me,\nsaying that he fortunately had been looking through the police station\nwindow, when he saw me passing, and that I answered to the description\nof a man wanted--\"for that affair at Cheltenham,\" I added. \"Ha,\" he\nsaid, his face lighting with pleasure, \"how well you know.\" We\nreturned quietly to the police station, and when I confronted his\nsuperior officer, I asked that person if I was to be arrested in every\ntown through which I passed; telling my experience the night before at\nGuildford. After one or two questions, and a careful reading of the\ndescription paper, also an examination of my pedlar's certificate, he\ntold me I was at liberty to go my way, at the same time saying that no\nman with any sense would have arrested me. After this I was not again\ntroubled by police officers, owing perhaps, to their having arrested\nthe guilty man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA DAY'S COMPANION\n\n\nI had many a strange experience in those days, especially one with an\nold man, who must have been between seventy and eighty years of age.\nHe accosted me through the hedges and, looking in that direction, I\nsaw him in the act of filling a quart can with blackberries, aided by\na thick long stick with a crooked end. \"Wait a moment,\" said he, \"for\nI also am going Bedford way.\" I was nothing loth to wait, for I was a\nstranger in that part of the country, and required information as to\nwhich was the best cheap lodging house for the night. I knew that in a\ntown of the size of Bedford there must be more than one common lodging\nhouse, and one must be better than another, if only in the extra smile\nof a landlady, regardless of clean blankets or cooking accommodation.\n\nFor this reason I waited, and, in less than three minutes, the old man\njoined me. His answer to my first question was disappointing, for it\nseemed that the number of lodging houses which Bedford could boast\nwere all public houses, and there was not one private house that\ncatered for beggars. This was a real disappointment, for I knew that\nwhosoever made tea at such a place, did so under the ill favoured\nglance of a landlady or landlord, perhaps both, who sold beer ready\nmade. In fact the facilities for making tea, cooking, or even washing\none's shirt, were extremely limited at such a place, which made it\nvery undesirable for a poor beggar like myself, who had great\ndifficulty in begging sufficient for his bed and board, and did not\nwish to be reminded of beer.\n\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"there must be in a town the size of Bedford one\nprivate lodging house, at least, to accommodate tramps.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"as a tramp I have been going in and out of that town\nfor over thirty years, and I never heard of such a place. You can make\nenquiries, and I should like to know different,\" he continued, rather\nsarcastically that I had doubted his knowledge. \"The two best houses\nare the 'Boot' and the 'Cock,' but seeing that the former takes in\nwomen, the latter I think would be the best for us. Are you going to\ndo business on the road?\" he enquired. \"Not to-day,\" I answered him,\n\"for I have enough for my bed, and an extra few coppers for food.\"\n\"All right,\" said he, \"we will travel together, and if I do a little\nbusiness on the way it won't interfere with you, and we have plenty of\ntime to reach the lodging house before dark.\" Having no objection to\nthis proposal we jogged pleasantly along.\n\nWe were now descending a steep incline and my companion, seeing a man\ncoming in the opposite direction, walking beside a bicycle, lost no\ntime in confronting that gentleman and pushing the blackberries under\nhis nose. \"No,\" said the man, gruffly, \"do you think I am going to\ncarry those things? but here's a copper for you.\" Well, thought I,\nthis man will never sell his berries if he does not show more\ndiscretion and offer them to more likely customers.\n\nJust after this we met a lady and gentleman, both well dressed and\napparently well to do. Touching his cap to these people my companion\nsoon had his blackberries within a few inches of their eyes, at the\nsame time using all his persuasive powers to induce them to make a\npurchase. In this he failed, as was to be expected, but continued to\nwalk step by step with them for several yards, until the gentleman\nhastily put his hand in his pocket and gave the old fellow sixpence,\nthe smallest change that he had.\n\nSeveral others were stopped after this, and although my fellow\ntraveller failed to sell his perishable goods, a number of people\nassisted him with coppers. In one instance I thought he surely could\nnot be of sound mind, for he had seen a party of ladies and gentlemen\nseating themselves in a motor car, and was hurrying with all speed in\nthat direction. In this case he failed at getting a hearing, for\nbefore he was half way towards them, the party had seated themselves\nand the car was moving rapidly away. My companion's lips trembled with\nvexation at seeing this.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said he, crossing the road to a baker's shop--\"I am\ngoing to exchange these berries for buns.\" Waiting outside I was soon\njoined again by this strange old fellow who then carried in his left\nhand four buns, his right hand still being in possession of the\nblackberries.\n\n\"You will never sell them,\" I said, \"if you do not offer them at more\nlikely places. See, there is a shop with fruit and vegetables: try\nthere.\" \"Why,\" he answered with a grin, \"how do you think I could make\na living if I sold them? The market value of these berries is about\none farthing, and it takes sixteen farthings to pay for my feather\n(bed) not reckoning scrand (food), and a glass or two of skimish\n(drink). In fact,\" said he, \"my day's work is done, and I am quite\nsatisfied with the result.\" Saying which he tumbled the blackberries\ninto the gutter and placed the can--which he used for making tea--into\na large self-made inside pocket. On getting a better view of them, I\nremarked that no person could buy such berries, for they were about\nthe worst assortment I had ever seen in my life. \"It would not pay to\nmake them very enticing,\" said he, \"or they would find a too ready\nsale.\" \"But what do you do when the season is over?\" I asked, \"for you\ncannot pick blackberries all the year round.\" \"Oh,\" he answered, \"I\nhave other ways of making a living. If I can get a good audience in a\npublic house, I can often make a day's living in a quarter of an hour,\nwith several drinks in the bargain.\" \"What, by singing or dancing?\" I\nasked. \"No,\" said he, \"but by reciting. Listen to this.\" With that he\nbegan to recite a long poem, line after line, until I began to hope\nhis memory would fail him. What a memory it was! Hundreds of lines\nwithout a break. When he came to the most dramatic parts he paused for\naction, and I knew that he was heedless of the approach of night, and\nhad forgotten that Bedford was still afar off. There was now no\nstopping of him; poem after poem he recited, and he introduced his\nsubjects with little speeches that were so different from his ordinary\nconversation, that it was apparent that he had committed them also to\nmemory for the benefit of a fit audience. If he was so zealous after a\nweary day's walk, and without stimulants, what would he be under the\ninfluence of several glasses of strong ale? I shuddered to think of\nit.\n\nWe were now about a mile from Bedford, and my companion had for the\nlast hour been reciting; as for myself I was travelling alone, for I\nhad forgotten him. Sometimes to my confusion he would startle me by a\nsudden question, but seeing that he made no pause for an answer, I\nsoon understood that no answer was required of me, for that he was\nstill reciting.\n\nAs we entered the outskirts of Bedford, my companion found it\nnecessary, owing to increase of traffic, to raise his voice, which he\ncontinued to do until at last the traffic became so very great that he\ncould not make himself heard. I had not heard his voice for the last\nfive minutes, when he suddenly clutched my shoulder and demanded what\nI thought of that. \"You have a wonderful memory,\" I said. \"Oh,\" said\nhe, \"that is nothing; I could entertain you for several days in like\nmanner, with fresh matter each day. Here we are at the 'Cock.' I like\nyour company and, if you are travelling my way to-morrow, let us go\ntogether. It is not every man that I would travel with two days in\nsuccession.\" And, thought I, it is not every man would travel in your\ncompany two days in succession. \"Which way are you going?\" I asked\nhim. \"Towards Northampton,\" said he. \"Alas,\" I answered, \"my direction\nis altogether different.\"\n\nWe now entered the \"Cock,\" and after calling for two glasses of ale,\nenquired as to accommodation for travellers, which we were informed\nwas good, there being plenty of room. Sometimes, if ale is not called\nfor, they are disinclined to letting beds, especially in the winter,\nwhen they find so little difficulty in filling the house.\n\nOn entering the kitchen we found it occupied by a number of men, some\nof whom recognised my fellow traveller, and spoke to him. But, strange\nto say, although this man had proved so garrulous with one for a\ncompanion, with the many he had very little to say, and sat in a\ncorner all through the evening smoking in silence, and paying no heed\nto others either by tongue, eye, or ear. Once or twice I saw his lips\nmove, when filling his pipe, or knocking out its ashes, and I thought\nthat he was perhaps rehearsing and training his memory for the\nfollowing day, in case he would be again fortunate in picking up with\nan easy fool like myself. For, no doubt, the poor old fellow had been\noften commanded to desist from reciting, and ordered to hell by\nimpatient and unsympathetic men whom he had at first mistaken for\nquiet and good natured companions. I had not by a look or a word\nsought to offend him, but one day of his company was certainly\nenough.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nTHE FORTUNE\n\n\nIt is not unusual to read of cases where men who have descended to the\nlowest forms of labour--aye, even become tramps--being sought and\nfound as heirs to fortunes, left often by people who either had no\npower to will otherwise, or whom death had taken unawares. Therefore,\nwhen one fine morning a cab drove up to a beer-house, which was also a\ntramps' lodging house, and a well dressed gentleman entered and\nenquired of the landlord for a man named James Macquire--the landlord\nat once pronounced him to be a solicitor in quest of a lost heir.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"we do not take the names of our lodgers, but several\nare now in the kitchen. James Macquire, you said?\" On receiving answer\nin the affirmative the landlord at once visited the lodgers' kitchen,\nand standing at the door enquired in a very respectable manner if\nthere was any gentleman present by the name of Macquire, whose\nchristian name was James. At which a delicate looking man, who had\narrived the previous night, sprang quickly to his feet and said in a\nsurprised voice--\"That is my name.\" \"Well,\" said the landlord, \"a\ngentleman wishes to see you at once; he came here in a cab, and, for\nyour sake, I trust my surmises are right.\"\n\nWith the exception of having on a good clean white shirt, the man\nMacquire was ill clad, and he looked ruefully at his clothes, and then\nat the landlord. \"Please ask the gentleman to wait,\" said he, and,\ngoing to the tap, began to wash his hands and face, after which he\ncarefully combed his hair.\n\nThe strange gentleman was seated quietly in the bar when the man\nMacquire presented himself, and the landlord was engaged in washing\nglasses and dusting decanters. \"Mr. James Macquire?\" asked the\ngentleman, rising and addressing the ill-clad one in a respectful\nmanner, which the landlord could not help but notice. \"That is my\nname,\" answered Macquire, with some dignity. \"Do you know anything of\nMr. Frederick Macquire, of Doggery Hall?\" asked the gentleman. \"I do,\"\nsaid the ill-clad one; and, after a long pause, and seeming to give\nthe information with much reluctance, he added--\"Mr. Frederick\nMacquire, of Doggery Hall, is my uncle.\" Several other questions were\nasked and answered. \"That will do, thank you,\" said the gentleman;\n\"will you please call at the 'King's Head' and see me at seven P. M.?\nYou have been advertised for since the death of Mr. Frederick\nMacquire, some weeks ago. Good morning,\" he said, shaking James\nMacquire by the hand in a highly respectful manner, as the landlord\ncould not fail to see, totally regardless of the man's rags.\n\nThe ill-clad one stood at the bar speechless, apparently absorbed in\ndeep thought. \"What will you have to drink?\" asked the landlord\nkindly. \"Whisky,\" answered Macquire, in a faint voice. After drinking\nthis, and another, he seemed to recover his composure, and said to the\nlandlord--\"I am at present, as you must know, penniless, and you would\ngreatly oblige me by the loan of a few shillings, say half a sovereign\nuntil I draw a couple of hundred pounds in advance. Whatever I receive\nfrom you, you shall have a receipt, and, although nothing is said\nabout interest, the amount owing will be doubled, aye trebled, you may\nrest assured of that, for I never forget a kindness.\" \"You had better\ntake a sovereign,\" said the landlord, \"and, of course, the Mrs. will\nsupply any meals you may need, and drink is at your disposal.\" \"Thank\nyou,\" said Macquire, in a choking voice--\"let me have a couple of pots\nof your best ale for the poor fellows in the kitchen.\"\n\nWhat a surprise for the poor lodgers when they were asked to drink\nMacquire's health! On being told of his good fortune, they one and all\ncheered and congratulated him. But the easy way in which this man\nMacquire threw his weight about the kitchen and, for that matter, the\nwhole house was extraordinary.\n\nNow it happened that there were at this house two stonemasons who,\nalthough heavy drinkers, had been working steady for a week or more,\nfor their job was drawing to a close, and they knew not how many idle\nweeks might follow. These men were at breakfast and, being repeatedly\noffered drink, grew careless and resolved to quit work there and then\nand draw their money, which amounted to three pounds ten shillings\nbetween them. Macquire favoured this resolution and, said he, \"Before\nyour money is spent, I shall have a couple of hundred pounds at my\ndisposal.\" The landlord was present at the passing of this resolution\nand, though he said nothing, apparently favoured it, for he laughed\npleasantly.\n\nIn less than half an hour Macquire and the two stonemasons were back\nin the lodging house kitchen, and drinking ale as fast as they\npossibly could. In a number of cases the former received money from\nhis new friends to buy the beer, but, according to after developments\nhe must have pocketed this money and had the beer entered to his\naccount, in addition to that which he fetched of his own accord.\nHowever, when evening came Macquire, though seemingly possessed of\nbusiness faculties, was not in a bodily condition to keep his lawyer's\nappointment. As he himself confessed--\"he was drunk in the legs, but\nsober in the brain.\" What an evening we had! Not one man in the house\nretired sober, and the kindness of the ill-clad one brought tears\ninto a number of eyes, for he made the stonemasons spend their money\nfreely, and he made the landlord fetch pot after pot, and all he did\nin the way of payment was to utter that name, grown strangely\npowerful--James Macquire.\n\nNow when the next morning came there seemed to be a suspicion that all\nwas not right. For, as soon as James Macquire put in an appearance,\none of the stonemasons abruptly asked when he intended to see the\nlawyer. At this moment the landlord entered, and, though he had not\nheard the question, he too, would like to know when Macquire intended\nseeing his lawyer. \"Don't bother me,\" said Macquire, \"you see what a\nstate I am in, trembling after drink?\" \"I'll soon put you right,\" said\nthe landlord, leaving the kitchen, and entering the bar.\n\nThe stonemasons offered their future benefactor a drink of beer, which\nhe waved aside, saying that he must first have a short drink to steady\nhis stomach. \"You don't mind giving me a saucerful of your tea?\" said\nMacquire to me, for I was then at breakfast. \"With pleasure,\" said I,\nand, filling the saucer pushed it towards him. \"Thank you,\" said he,\nafter drinking it--\"that saucer of tea has cost me a sovereign!\"\n\"Nonsense,\" said I, inwardly pleased, \"it is of no value whatever.\"\n\"Have you any tobacco?\" he asked. At this question one of the\nstonemasons, in fear that Macquire would promise me more money,\nsprang forward with tobacco. \"I am not asking you for tobacco,\" said\nMacquire slowly--\"but am asking this gentleman.\" This was said in such\na way as could not give offence; as much as to say that he already\nknew that the stonemason's heart was good, but that he felt disposed\nto test mine and, if he found it generous, he would not forget me when\nhe came into his estate. Not setting great value on a pipeful of\ntobacco, I offered him my pouch to help himself. After he had filled\nhis pipe, he said, in an abrupt manner, as he was walking towards the\nbar--\"Please remember, friend, I am five pounds in your debt.\" \"What a\nfine fellow he is,\" said the stonemason to me; \"for the few kindnesses\nwe did him yesterday, he has promised me and my pal twenty pounds each\nout of his first advance, and larger sums to follow.\"\n\nAt this moment the postman entered with a letter addressed to James\nMacquire, Esq. If the landlord, or any one else, had the least\nsuspicion earlier in the morning, it certainly vanished at the sight\nof this letter. Macquire opened the letter and, after reading it,\npassed it to the landlord. That gentleman's face beamed with\nsatisfaction, although it was but an ordinary note saying that the\nlawyer had expected Macquire the night previous, and trusted that he\nwould keep the appointment at the same hour on the following day, by\nwhich time the lawyer would be able to advance him some money.\n\"That's something like business,\" said Macquire, to which every one\nagreed, the landlord and the stonemasons showing the most approval.\n\n\"Now,\" said James Macquire to the landlord, \"you had better let me\nhave some money.\" \"What for?\" asked that gentleman; \"you can have\nanything that you require, as I told you before.\" \"Just for my own\nsatisfaction,\" said Macquire. \"I am going to walk out for a while, so\nas to keep myself sober for business.\" \"You can't go out in those\nrags,\" said the landlord--\"you had better take my best suit.\"\n\nIn ten minutes or less the ill-clad one was standing at the bar in the\nlandlord's best suit of clothes, after which the said landlord gave\nhim all the money available, amounting to thirty shillings. \"How much\nam I in your debt?\" asked Macquire. \"Oh, about three pounds,\" was the\nanswer. \"We will call it fifty pounds,\" cried Macquire and, drinking\nhis whisky, he left the house, followed closely by the faithful\nstonemasons.\n\nIn half an hour the stonemasons were back, having lost their companion\nin the market place, and were at the bar awaiting him, thinking he\nmight have already returned. Yes, and they could wait, for that was\nthe last of Macquire, and, to the surprise and mortification of the\nlandlord and the two stonemasons, the house received no more visits or\nletters from lawyers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nSOME WAYS OF MAKING A LIVING\n\n\nNo doubt laces are the best stock to carry, for a gross of them can be\nhad for eighteen pence, sometimes less, which, sold at a penny a pair,\nrealises six shillings; and, counting the number of pennies that are\ntendered free in pity for the man's circumstances, who must be cunning\nenough to show only two or three pairs at a time--he has nothing to\ncomplain of in the end. Although he sometimes meets a lady who\npersists in regarding him as a trader and bargains for two pairs for\nthree halfpence, and ultimately carries them off in triumph--in spite\nof his whine of not being able to make bed and board out of them--in\nspite of these rare instances, he must confess that in the end he has\nreceived eight or nine shillings for an outlay of eighteen pence, and,\nwhat is more, an abundance of free food. Then, again, laces are light,\nthey are easy to carry and can be stored in one coat-pocket. Another\ngreat advantage is that although a man may get wet through, or roll on\nhis laces in the grass, he does not spoil his living. In fact, if they\nbecome crumpled and twisted and their tags rusty, he makes them his\ntestimony that he was wet through, being out all night, which story\nrarely fails in coppers and he still retains his laces.\n\nBut with all these advantages of a light and profitable stock, there\nare two men who scorn to carry even these and will not on any account\nmake any pretence at selling. These two men are the gridler and the\ndownrighter. The former sings hymns in the streets, and he makes his\nliving by the sound of his voice. Professional singers are paid\naccording to the richness, sweetness, and compass of their voices, but\nthe gridler's profit increases as his vocal powers decline. The more\nshaky and harsh his voice becomes, the greater his reward. With a\ntongue like a rasp he smoothes the roughness off hard hearts. With a\nvoice like an old hen he ushers in the golden egg. With a base mixture\nof treble, contralto and bass, he produces good metal which falls from\ntop story windows, or is thrown from front doors, to drop at his feet\nwith the true ring. Then, if the voice be immaterial, where lies the\nart of gridling? No more or less than in the selection of hymns, which\nmust be simple and pathetic and familiar to all. Let the gridler\nsupply the words sufficiently to be understood, and the simple air\nwith variations--a good gridler often misses parts of the air itself\nfor breathing spells and in stooping for coppers--let him supply the\nwords, I say, and his hearers will supply the feeling. For instance,\nif a gridler has sung an old well known hymn fifty or sixty times a\nday for ten or fifteen years, he cannot reasonably be expected to be\naffected by the words. It would be extremely thoughtless to request of\nsuch an one an encore without giving a promise of further reward. In\nfact this man is really so weary of song that if there is any merry\nmaking at the lodging house, he is the one man who will not sing, not\neven under the influence of drink; and, what is more no man would\ninvite him for, being a gridler and earning his living by song, we\nknow well that his voice is spoilt, and that he cannot sing. The\ngridler considers himself to be at the top of the begging profession,\nfor his stock never gets low, nor requires replenishing; and his voice\nis only a little weak thing of no weight, the notes of which are born\ninto the world from his throat, and was never roused from sleep in the\ndepths of his chest. There is no strain or effort in giving these\nnotes to the world--despite the gridler's affectations--and he neither\ngrows pale nor red with the exertion.\n\nBut the downrighter not only scorns grinders, pedlars, etc., but he\neven despises the gridler for being a hard worker. \"I,\" says he, \"do\nnot carry laces, needles, matches, or anything else; and I do not\nadvertise my presence to the police by singing in the streets. If\npeople are not in the front of the house, I seek them at the back,\nwhere a gridler's voice may not reach them. I am not satisfied with\ngetting a penny for a farthing pair of laces--I get the whole penny\nfor nothing. People never mistake me for a trader, for I exhibit no\nwares, and tell them straightforward that I am begging the price of my\nsupper and bed.\"\n\nThe fact of the matter is that all these men have different ways of\nmaking a living, and each man thinks his own way the best and fears to\nmake new experiments, such an opinion being good for the trade of\nbegging. Sometimes, owing to the vigilance of the police, and their\nstrict laws, the gridler has to resort to downright begging, but his\nheart is not in the business, and he is for that reason unsuccessful.\nHe longs to get in some quiet side street where he can chant slowly\nhis well known hymns. But everything is in favour of the more silent\ndownrighter; who allows nothing to escape him, neither stores, private\nor public houses, nor pedestrians. All he is required to do is to keep\nhimself looking something like a working man, and he receives more\ncharity in the alehouse by a straightforward appeal as an unemployed\nworkman, than another who wastes his time in giving a song and a\ndance. People often hurry past when they hear a man singing, or see\none approaching with matches or laces, but the downrighter claims\ntheir attention before they suspect his business.\n\nWhen I met Long John at Oxford, we had much talk of the merits of\ndifferent parts of a beggar's profession. He, it seemed, had carried\nlaces; he had also gridled sacred hymns in the streets, and sung\nsporting songs in the alehouses; he had even exerted himself as a\ndancer, \"but,\" said he, \"I must confess, after all, that as a\ndownrighter my profits are larger, at the expenditure of far less\nenergy.\"\n\nIn the course of conversation Long John informed me that he also was\ntravelling London way, and if I was agreeable we would start together\non the following morning. \"And,\" said he, in a whisper, so that other\nlodgers might not hear--\"there is a house on our way that is good for\na shilling each. He is a very rich man and has been an officer in the\narmy. He pretends to be prejudiced against old soldiers, and when they\nappeal to him, he first abuses them, after which he drills them and,\nafter abusing them again rewards each with a two shilling piece. Do\nyou know the drills'?\" \"No,\" I answered, \"I have never been in the\narmy.\" \"That is a great pity,\" said Long John, \"for we lose a shilling\neach. However, we will not say that we are old soldiers, for fear of\nlosing all, and be satisfied with the two shillings between us.\" So it\nwas agreed.\n\nIn less than two hours we were at the gentleman's lodge. Passing\nboldly through the gates we followed the drive until we saw before us\na fine large mansion. Reaching the front door we rang the bell, which\nwas soon answered by a servant. To our enquiries as to whether the\nmaster was in the servant replied in the negative, but intimated that\nthe mistress was. Of course, this made not the least difference, as\nmany a tramp knew, except that had we been old soldiers the lady not\nbeing able to test us by drill, would therefore not have given more\nthan the civilian's shilling. Now, almost unfortunately for us,\nthe downrighter, knowing that the lady would not drill us, and\nthinking that there might be a possibility of getting the master's\ndouble pay to old soldiers, without danger of drill or cross\nexamination--suddenly made up his mind to say that we were two old\nsoldiers. For, thought he, if it does no good, it cannot do any harm.\nTherefore, when the lady appeared smiling at the door Long John, being\nspokesman, told a straightforward tale of hardship, and added that we\nhad both served our country on the battlefield as soldiers. He had\nscarcely mentioned the word soldiers when a loud authoritative voice\nbehind us cried--\"Shoulder Arms!\" I was leaning heavily on a thick\nstick when this command was given, but lost my balance and almost fell\nto the ground. We both turned our faces towards the speaker and saw a\ntall military looking gentleman scrutinising us with two very sharp\neyes. Giving us but very little time to compose ourselves he shouted\nagain--\"Present Arms!\" This second command was no more obeyed than the\nfirst. Long John blew his nose, and I stood at ease on my staff, as\nthough I did not care whether the dogs were set upon us or we were to\nbe lodged in jail. After another uncomfortable pause the retired\nofficer said, looking at us severely--\"Two old soldiers, indeed! You\nare two imposters and scoundrels! Perhaps you understand this\ncommand\"--and in a voice fiercer and louder than ever he cried, \"Quick\nMarch!\" Long John and I, although not old soldiers, certainly\nunderstood this command, for we started down the drive at a good pace,\nwith the military looking gentleman following. When we reached the\npublic road, he gave another command--\"Halt!\" But this was another of\nthose commands which we did not understand. However, on its being\nrepeated less sternly we obeyed. \"Here,\" said he, \"you are not two old\nsoldiers, but you may not be altogether scoundrels; and I never turn\nmen away without giving them some assistance.\" Saying which he gave us\na shilling each. But what a narrow escape we had of being turned\npenniless away, all through Long John's greed and folly!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nAT LAST\n\n\nIn spite of these occasional successes with Long John and others, I\nwas often at my wits' ends to procure food and shelter. This always\nhappened when I travelled alone. I was now heartily sick of this\nwandering from town to town, and every day seemed to get more\nunfortunate; until the first day in December, when, forced by extreme\nwant, I resolved to enter the city at once, knowing that a pound was\nalready there waiting my pleasure. That night I was back in the\nFarmhouse; and what a genial spirit seemed to animate the old coke\nfire! Not at all like the death dealer, the waster of time, who robbed\na human being of his energy and a kitten of its play. Oh, no; for this\none night we were the best of friends, and sunny smiles passed between\nus until bed time.\n\nI had been away five months, and would still have to suffer owing to\nthis early return; knowing that I would not have courage to sell in\nthe streets of London, and that I would be compelled to eke out a\nliving on five shillings a week, until the beginning of the new\nyear--this being a half crown for lodgings, and the same for food.\n\nI was very well satisfied with myself at this time, with the prospect\nof the new year before me; and at once began to get my work ready for\nthe press. When all original composition was done, and it was\nnecessary to make ready a copy for the printer, even at this time I\nwas confronted with a foolish hindrance. One library in Lambeth, which\nat one time had a table with pens, ink and blotting pads for the\nconvenience of visitors, had had these things removed; but seeing no\nsign to the contrary, I still thought I would be allowed to take\npossession of a corner of this table and write, providing I supplied\nmy own material. So, this library was chosen for my week's writing,\nbut I was warned off at the commencement. Thoroughly incensed at this\nfresh and paltry hindrance, I sought a library where I knew my work\ncould be continued without interference, even if the writing of it\ntook some years. This library was not so convenient as the other,\nbeing some distance away, but there I at last succeeded in performing\nmy task.\n\nNow came the new year when, independent of others, I would be enabled\nto assist myself. If I failed in making success, the disappointment\nwould be mine only, and if I succeeded, there would be none other to\nthank but myself. On receiving this money, in the first week in\nJanuary, I lost no time in seeing the printer and arranging for an\nedition of two hundred and fifty copies, the cost to be nineteen\npounds. This amount certainly did not cover expenses, and here began\nthe series of kindnesses which, after a few more disappointments, were\nto follow. This printer placed the MS. in the hands of a good reader,\nand that gentleman was put to considerable trouble, being baffled and\ninterested in turns. The last two lines of a poem entitled \"The hill\nside park\" are entirely his, both in thought and expression. I mention\nthis because two or three correspondents liked the poem in question,\nand one thought the last two lines the best; so, I take this\nopportunity to clear my conscience. There was nothing to complain of,\nboth printer and reader being at great pains and patience to make the\nwork better than it was. Naturally, I thought if there was any\ninterest shown, it would not be in the author's personality, but in\nthe work itself, and for this reason, gave the Farmhouse, a common\nlodging house, as my address. I was under the impression that people\nwould uninterestedly think the Farmhouse to be a small printing\nestablishment, or a small publishing concern of which they had not\nheard; to which they would forward their orders, and business would be\ntransacted without their being any the wiser. In the first week in\nMarch I received my first printed copy.\n\nThe printer had sent thirty copies or more to the various papers, and\nI was now waiting the result, which at last came in the shape of two\nvery slim reviews from the North; a Yorkshire paper saying that the\nwork had rhymes that were neither intricate nor original, and a Scotch\npaper saying that the work was perfect in craftsmanship rather than\ninspired. This was very disappointing, more so to know that others,\nwho were powerless to assist me, were interesting themselves on my\nbehalf. Although I still had confidence that the work contained some\ngood things, I began to think that there must be some glaring faults\nwhich made the book, as a whole, impossible to review. This first\nthought became my first belief when other notices did not follow.\n\nWeeks and weeks went by and, having now started to drink, and losing\ncontrol of my will in this disappointment, I had come down to my last\nten shillings, and had a good seven months to go before my money was\nagain due. First of all I had serious thoughts of destroying this\nwork--the whole two hundred and odd copies, which were under lock and\nkey in my room, and to then set to work carefully on new matter, and,\nwhen my income was again due, to again mortgage it in another attempt.\nBeing very impulsive, this no doubt would have been there and then\ncommenced, had I not been confronted with the difficulty of doing so.\nThere was only one way of doing this properly, and that was by fire,\nwhich would require privacy. My room was the only place where I could\ndo this without being seen, but that contained neither stove nor\ngrate; and, even if it had, two hundred books would take a number of\nsleepless nights to render into ashes. I thought with some bitterness\nof having to go on tramp again, and it was in one of these bitter\nmoments that I swore a great oath that these copies, good or bad,\nshould maintain me until the end of the year. For I would distribute\nthe books here and there, sending them to successful people, and they\nwould probably pay for their copies, perhaps not so much for what\nmerit they might think the work contained, as for the sake of\ncircumstances. This idea no sooner possessed me than I began preparing\nfor its execution. For this purpose I obtained stamps and envelopes,\nand six copies were at once posted. The result was seen in a couple of\ndays--three letters, two containing the price of the book, and the\nthird from the Charity Organisation, the latter writing on behalf of a\ngentleman who had become interested, and would like to come to my\nassistance. Remembering these people in the past, through my former\nexperience with them, I had no great hopes at the present time, in\nspite of the kind hearted interest of the gentleman in question.\nHowever, I called on them the next morning, and after the usual long\nwait in a side room--which, I believe, is not through any great stress\nof business, but so as to bring one's heart down to the freezing point\nof abject misery, and to extinguish one by one his many hopes--after\nthis weary waiting, I received an interview. There is not sufficient\nvenom in my disposition to allow me to describe this meeting in words\nfit and bitter for its need. This life is too short to enable me to\nrecover from my astonishment, which will fill me for a good many years\nto come. The questions and answers which had passed between us on our\nformer interview,--two years previous, were now before them. But they\nquestioned again in the same strain, and my answers corresponded with\nthose of the past, for I told no lies. Apparently they had no chance\nhere, so they came at once to the business in hand. \"You have written\nto a gentleman, asking for his assistance?\" Not liking this way of\nexplaining my conduct, I said--\"No, not exactly that, but have been\ntrying to sell him some work that I had done.\" It seemed that they\nknew nothing of this work--or that it better suited their purpose to\nappear ignorant--so it was necessary to give them the full\nparticulars. \"Was not the book a success?\" they asked. Not caring to\nadmit failure, and still thinking the work worthy of a little success,\nI answered--\"Not yet, but it is too early to judge it as a failure.\"\nThen I gave it in confidence that a gentleman, well known in\nSouthwark, and who often wrote articles on literary subjects, had\npromised to review it in one of the evening papers, which might lead\nto other notices. \"What is the name of this gentleman?\" The name was\nat once mentioned, for there was no reason that I knew of, to\nwithhold it. But instead of this name doing me good, as I then\nexpected, it probably made this case of mine more unfavorable; for I\nhave been told since that this gentleman had more than once attacked\nthe ways and methods of this Organisation, both on the public platform\nand through the press. Not knowing this, at that time, I thought it\nextremely fortunate to be enabled to mention the favour of such a well\nknown local man. All went smoothly for a while--although I could\nplainly see that these people did not recognise the writing of books\nas work, and were plainly disgusted at the folly of sacrificing an\nincome to that end. Their next question confirmed this opinion--\"Do\nyou ever do anything for a living?\" I mentioned that I had tramped the\ncountry as a hawker, during the previous summer, but had suffered\nthrough want of courage, could not make anything like a living, and\nwas often in want and without shelter. There was a rather long pause,\nand the Charity Organisation rose slowly to their feet, and said--\"Mr.\nDavies, do you really expect this gentleman, who has written to us, to\nmaintain you? Is there anything the matter with you?\" What was the\nmatter with me did not seem to escape many people, and it was most\ncertainly noted by the smallest toddler that played in the street, but\nthe Charity Organisation did not think proper to recognise any other\nthan an able man, strong in the use of all his limbs. \"No,\" said\nthese people, \"you must do the same as you did last summer;\" which, in\nother words was--go on tramp, starve, and be shelterless as you were\nbefore. And then in the deep silence which followed, for I was\nspeechless with indignation, a voice soft and low, but emphatic and\nsignificant, said--\"We strongly advise you to do this, but you really\nmust not write any more begging letters. Mr. Davies, we do not\nconsider ourselves justified in putting your case before the\ncommittee.\" That ended the interview, and I left them with the one\nsarcastic remark, which I could not keep unsaid, \"that I had not come\nthere with any great hopes of receiving benefit, and that I was not\nleaving greatly disappointed at this result.\" These people passed\njudgment in a few minutes, and were so confident that they did not\nthink it worth while to call at the Farmhouse for the opinion of a man\nwho had known me for a considerable time. No doubt they had made\nanother mistake. For, some time before this, an old pensioner, an old\nlodger of the Farmhouse, had interviewed these people, telling them a\nstory of poverty, and of starving wife and children. The story was a\nfabrication from beginning to end, yet they assisted this man on his\nbare word to the extent of ten shillings, so as to enable him to lie\nabout the Farmhouse drunk for several days. Then, some days after\nthis, the Charity Organisation called at the Farmhouse to see the\nmanager, and to make enquiries of this man whom they had so\nmysteriously befriended. \"What,\" cried that gentleman, \"you have\nassisted this drunken fellow on his bare word, and when I send cases\nto you, that I know are deserving, you sternly refuse to entertain\nthem.\" Perhaps it was this instance, fresh in their minds, which gave\nthem an idea that no good could come out of the Farmhouse. Yet, as far\nas my experience goes, the object of these people was not so much to\ndo good, but to prevent good from being done; for here, for the second\ntime, they stepped between me and one who might have rendered me some\naid. What I found the most distasteful part of their system was the\nway in which they conceal the name of a would-be benefactor. I had\nsent six books, three to men and three to women. One man had replied\nwith a kind encouraging letter and the price of the book enclosed, and\none of the two others had written to the Organisation, but, on no\naccount, would they mention his name. Now, when these people answer a\nletter of enquiry, they have no other option than to say one of two\nthings--either that the applicant is an impostor, and deserves no\nnotice, or that the case is genuine and deserving consideration. They,\nof course, answered in the former strain, withholding the gentleman's\nname, so as to leave no opportunity to vindicate one's character.\n\nThe interference of these people put me on my mettle, and I was\ndetermined not to follow their advice and tramp through another hard\nwinter. I had something like three shillings, at the time of this\ninterview; so, buying two shillings' worth of stamps, I posted a dozen\nbooks that very night, being still warm with resentment. The result of\nthese were four kind letters, each containing the price of the book.\nOnly one or two were returned to me, whether purchased or not, which\nwas done at my own wish. Before I again became penniless, off went\nanother dozen. In this way I disposed of some sixty copies, with more\nor less success; some of these well known people receiving the book as\nan unacknowledged gift, and others quickly forwarding the price of the\nsame. The strangest part of this experience was this: that people,\nfrom whom I expected sympathy, having seen their names so often\nmentioned as champions of unfortunate cases, received the book as a\ngift; whilst others, from whom I had less hope, because they appeared\nsarcastic and unfeeling in their writings, returned the price of the\nwork. The Manager was astonished at my receiving no answer from two or\nthree well known people whom he had recommended. At last, after\ndisposing of sixty copies in this way, two well known writers\ncorresponded with me, one of whom I saw personally, and they both\npromised to do something through the press. Relying on these promises,\nI sent away no more copies, being enabled to wait a week or two owing\nto the kindness of a playwriter, an Irishman, as to whose mental\nqualification the world is divided, but whose heart is unquestionably\ngreat. Private recognition was certainly not long forthcoming, which\nwas soon followed by a notice in a leading daily paper, and in a\nliterary paper of the same week. These led to others, to interviews\nand a kindness that more than made amends for past indifference. It\nwas all like a dream. In my most conceited moments I had not expected\nsuch an amount of praise, and they gathered in favour as they came,\nuntil one wave came stronger than the others and threw me breathless\nof all conceit, for I felt myself unworthy of it, and of the wonderful\nsea on which I had embarked. Sleep was out of the question, and new\nwork was impossible. What surprised me agreeably was the reticence of\nmy fellow lodgers, who all knew, but mentioned nothing in my hearing\nthat was in any way disconcerting. They were, perhaps, a little less\nfamiliar, but showed not the least disrespect in their reserve, as\nwould most certainly have been the case if I had succeeded to a\npeerage or an immense fortune. The lines on Irish Tim, which were\nseveral times quoted, were a continual worry to me, thinking some of\nthe more waggish lodgers would bring them to his notice. Poor Tim, no\ndoubt, would have sulked, resenting this publicity, but, if the truth\nwere known, I would as soon do Tim a good turn as any other man in\nthe Farmhouse. Boozy Bob, I suppose, had been shown his name in print;\nbut Bob thought it a great honour to be called Boozy; so, when he\nstood drunk before me, with his face beaming with smiles of gratitude\nfor making use of his name, at the same time saying--\"Good evening,\nMr. Davies, how are you?\"--I at once understood the meaning of this\nunusual civility, and we both fell a-laughing, but nothing more was\nsaid. What a lot of decent, honest fellows these were: \"You must not\nbe surprised,\" said a gentleman to me, at that time, \"to meet less\nsincere men than these in other walks of life.\" I shall consider\nmyself fortunate in not doing so.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nSUCCESS\n\n\nHowever much cause I may have at some future date to complain of\nsevere criticism, I have certainly no complaint up to the present\nagainst any connected with the making of books. Some half a dozen\nlines of work were submitted to publishers, and three times I received\nletters with a view to publication, which, of course, failed through\nthe want of friends to assist me. Knowing how rough and unequal the\nwork was, and that critics could find--if so inclined--plenty to\njustify extreme severity, has undeceived me as to my former\nunreasonable opinion, that critics were more prone to cavil than to\npraise. I would like it to be understood that I say this without\nbidding for any future indulgence; for I am thankful to any man who\nwill show me my faults, and am always open to advice.\n\nAs I have said, the first notice appeared in a leading daily paper, a\nfull column, in which I saw myself described, a rough sketch of the\nups and downs of my life, in short telling sentences, with quotations\nfrom my work. The effect of this was almost instantaneous, for\ncorrespondence immediately followed. Letters came by every post. Of\ncourse, all my thoughts had been concentrated on the reading world, so\nthat I was much surprised when two young men came to the house and\nrequested a photo for an illustrated paper. I could not oblige them at\nthat moment, but with a heart overflowing with gratitude was persuaded\nto accompany them at once to the nearest photographer, now that\ninterest was at its high point. \"Now,\" said one of these young men,\nwhen I was on my way with them, delighted with this mission--\"now, if\nyou could give me a few lines on the war in the East, to go with your\nphotograph, it would be of much greater interest to the public.\" Not\ncaring to blow the froth off my mind in this indifferent manner, and\nfeeling too conscientious to take advantage of public interest by\nwriting in such haste, which, to tell the truth, appeared a difficult\ntask--I quickly turned the subject to other matters, thinking he would\nsoon forget his request. But it was of no use; for, every other step\nor two, he wanted to be informed whether I was concentrating my mind\non the war. At last, being under the impression that my natural\nreserve and feeble attempts at conversation would lead him to believe\nthat something was being done in that direction, I made a great effort\nto become voluble, and, I believe, succeeded until the photograph was\ntaken. When I left him, his last question was--\"What about the war?\"\n\nThe next morning, after the last mentioned episode, being Sunday, I\nwas enjoying a stroll through the city, which is so very quiet on this\none morning of the week; and was thinking of nothing else but my own\naffairs, more especially of the photo that was soon to appear. The\nstreet was forsaken, with the exception--yes, there they were: two men\nwith a camera, and both of them looking my way, anxiously awaiting my\napproach. \"This,\" I said to myself, \"is fame with a vengeance.\" I felt\na little mortification at being expected to undergo this operation in\nthe public streets. One of these photographers quickly stepped forward\nto meet me, and, smiling blandly, requested me kindly to stand for a\nmoment where I was. It certainly shocked and mortified me more to\nlearn that they desired to photograph an old fashioned dwelling of\nbrick and mortar, and that they considered my presence as no adornment\nto the front.\n\nA few days after this first review, a critic of fine literature, who\nhad interested himself privately on my behalf, sent a notice to a\nweekly literary paper; and it was the respect due to this man's name\nthat drew the attention of some other papers of good standing, for\ntheir representatives mentioned this man's name with every respect,\nknowing, at the same time, that he would not waste his hours on what\nwas absolutely worthless.\n\nWhat kind hearted correspondents I had, and what offers they made,\nwhat questions they asked! and all of them received grateful\nanswers--with one exception. This gentleman, who did not require a\nbook, presumably being more interested in the strange conditions under\nwhich I had lived and worked, offered me a pleasant home in the\ncountry, where I could cultivate my talents surrounded with a little\nmore comfort and quieter scenes. The letter was long, delightful,\npoetical, and worked warmly on my imagination, sentence for sentence;\nuntil the last sentence came like a douche of cold water on a warm\nbody--\"Of course,\" finished this gentleman, \"it is necessary to supply\nme with strict references as to honesty and respectability.\" Where was\nI to get these? after having failed to get a library form signed,\nwhich would entitle me to borrow books. No doubt the manager of the\nFarmhouse would have willingly done the latter, as was afterwards done\nby him, but I was then under the impression that the keeper of a\nlodging house was ineligible for such a purpose, knowing this to have\nbeen the case elsewhere. Where could I obtain these references, seeing\nthat I knew no one who would take the responsibility of doing such a\npetty kindness as signing a library form? This gentleman's letter, I\nneed scarcely say, remained unanswered, for which, I believe, none\nwill blame me.\n\nSeveral other letters were received, which I found extremely difficult\nto answer. One addressed me familiarly in rhyme, beginning--\"Dear\nbrother poet, brother Will;\" and went on to propose that we two should\ntake a firm stand together, side by side, to the everlasting benefit\nof poetry and posterity.\n\nAnother had written verse, and would be glad to find a publisher, and\nanother could, and would, do me many a good turn, if I felt inclined\nto correct his work, and to add lines here and there as needed. Not\nfor a moment would I hold these people to ridicule, but it brought to\nmind that I was without a publisher for my own work, and I believed,\nin all sincerity, that better work than mine might go begging, as it\noften had.\n\nIn the main my correspondents were kind, sympathetic and sensible,\nmaking genuine offers of assistance, for which I thanked them with all\nmy heart, but thought myself now beyond the necessity of accepting\nthem.\n\nAs a matter of fact, no one man in a common lodging house is supposed\nto be regarded with any special favour. The common kitchen is his\nlibrary, his dining room and his parlour, and better accommodation\ncannot be expected at the low price of fourpence per night. We are all\nequal, without a question of what a man's past may have been, or what\nhis future is likely to realise. Any man who puts on superior airs is\ninvariably subjected to this sarcastic enquiry--\"How much do you pay?\"\nor the incontrovertible remark that one man's fourpence is as good as\nanother's. The Manager has to use great tact in not indulging in too\nlong a conversation with one particular man, and a lodger must not\njeopardise his popularity by an overweening anxiety to exchange\ncivilities, or to repose confidence in those who are in authority; for\nthese lodgers are in general distrustful and suspicious. If a fish\nporter--a good number of these men were here--was warned after any\nmisconduct, he would turn to one of his pals and say--\"Billingsgate, I\nsee, is not favoured in this place.\" And if a paper-seller--of which\nthere were about an equal number--was called to account in the same\nway, his remark would be that had he been a fish porter the misconduct\nwould have been overlooked. Such was the state of feeling in the\nFarmhouse, although the caretaker, time after time, almost daily,\nreiterated the remark that one man was as good as another, and that no\ndistinction was made between the two classes. Knowing this state of\nfeeling, and the child-like distrust and jealousy of these honest\nfellows, it was no wonder that I felt a little awkward at the change\nof circumstances; for, after all, I was still a lodger, and paying no\nmore than them for the same conveniences. In spite of this, I don't\nbelieve I suffered the least in popularity when the Manager,\ndetermined that I should not suffer any longer for want of privacy to\npursue my aims, threw open his own private rooms for my convenience.\nAnd, every time I took advantage of his kindness, the Manager's wife\nwould take advantage of this by supplying a hot dinner or tea, as the\nhour might be, so that my studies might not be interrupted, or food\npostponed through an anxiety to perform a certain task.\n\nThe Manager was astonished at my success, and, after he had read\nseveral notices, it certainly must have made him bitter against those\nwhom he had approached on my behalf. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I must confess\nto failure, in your case, and I am left wondering as to what kind of\ncases these people consider worthy of assistance.\" The man, being in a\nsubordinate position, dare not openly speak his thoughts, or appear to\nforce the hands of those rich visitors, but he certainly lost no\nopportunity in showing some honest Irish blood in his references to\nthe Charity Organisation. \"Miss So and So has been here,\" said he, one\nmorning; \"and I lost no time in relating your experience with the\nCharity Organisation. She was very much offended and shocked, and she\nhas now gone there to seek some explanation.\" \"As for that,\" I\nanswered, knowing these people had all the power to make good their\nown case, and that I would not be called upon to sift the false from\nthe true--\"As for that, this lady will return satisfied, as you will\nsee.\" The Manager did not altogether believe this, saying that he\nthought the lady in question was not a blind believer in anything, and\nhad an unusual amount of common sense. She certainly did return\nsatisfied, saying that she thought they were justified in their\nconduct, to a certain extent. On being questioned by the Manager, who\nclaimed it justice that the truth should be known, she said that she\ndare not make public the sayings and doings of the Society. I am now\ngiving my experiences honestly and truthfully, and thought for\nthought, if not word for word, as they happened. As a man whose\nambition above all other things is to impress every one favourably, I\nhave come to the conclusion that my work has been praised far more\nthan its worth, owing to having met the writers of some of those\narticles, and impressing them in a simple, honest way. I am writing\nthese experiences with a full knowledge of human nature, knowing that\nmany people will remark: \"Take no heed of that man, for he has not a\ngood word for any one or anything;\" but, as far as my knowledge and\nexperience goes it is the truth, and, if that seems false and\nsensational, it is no fault of mine. Certainly I have led a worthless,\nwandering and lazy life, with, in my early days, a strong dislike to\ncontinued labour, and incapacitated from the same in later years. No\nperson seemed inclined to start me on the road to fame, but, as soon\nas I had made an audacious step or two, I was taken up, passed quickly\non from stage to stage, and given free rides farther than I expected.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nA HOUSE TO LET\n\n\nApparently the ill luck which had pursued me so close in the past,\nwould not let me escape without another scratch. In my pleasant walks\nin my native town, my eye happened to fall on a beautiful house,\nuntenanted in a neighbourhood so quiet that every other house seemed\nto be the same. The very name, Woodland Road, was an address for a\npoet. It was a four storied villa, standing on the top of a hilly\nroad, from where one could see on a clear mistless day the meeting of\nthe Severn and the Bristol Channel; and, looking in another direction,\ncould see the whole town without hearing one of its many voices.\nUnfortunately, I coveted this house as a tenant, thinking to get more\npleasure in one glance from its top window on a bright summer's\nmorning than from the perusal of many books. Even now, in Winter, it\npresented a warm, comfortable appearance, with its evergreens and its\nivied walls. A tall, spreading rose bush stood facing its lowest\nwindow, and I imagined the bashful red roses looking in at me, as\nthough I would not come out of doors to please them. There were\nprimrose leaves green on the rockery, and one yellow flower still\nstood, withered and bent, in this last week of November. There was\nalso an apple tree and a pear tree, so that the front of the house was\nboth a park and an orchard. Blackbirds, robins, and thrushes visited\nthe grounds daily; and I believe that this house was their nearest\napproach to town. It only wanted a few touches of Spring, and here\nwere shady nooks, and leafy boughs for birds to sing unseeing and\nunseen. Thinking that this beautiful place would not remain untenanted\nfor long, I at once made application, being recommended by my old\nmaster of the days of my apprenticeship. Had I known that the house\nwas always empty and untenanted, and that people came and went at\nshort notice, I should certainly not have been in such a hurry to take\npossession, in spite of its natural beauties. It was neither haunted\nby ghosts nor animal noises, but by the landlady, who lived in the\nnext house. This lady I did not see, nor have I seen her up to the\npresent time, one of my family having taken the place in my name.\nProbably if I had transacted business personally, and had had an\nopportunity of seeing this landlady's face, I had not coveted the\nhouse, and, according to a right judgment of human nature, would have\nsaved myself the money and disappointment that was to follow.\nHowever, the house became mine, and I received the key which was to\nlet me possess this house and its interesting grounds.\n\nI idled a week about town descanting with great pleasure on the\nbeauties of my future home; but I was somewhat taken by surprise at\nthe unfavourable reception with which my news was received. \"Who is\nthe landlady?\" asked one. \"Mrs. S,\" I answered; \"she lives next door.\"\n\"It is very unfortunate,\" said this person, \"that the landlady lives\nnext door.\" \"Every one can please themselves,\" said another, \"but as\nfor myself, I would never dream of living next door to my landlady.\"\n\"What\": cried another, \"the landlady lives next door? What a great\npity, to be sure.\" Although the last named depreciator was the\nrespectable wife of a retired tradesman, and had given her own\nlandlady satisfaction for a number of years; in spite of this, I was\nhighly amused at these remarks, taking the uncharitable view that\nthese people were really not so respectable as they seemed, and would\nnot be allowed to live under the watchful eyes of a particular person.\nMy landlady, I thought, be she ever so watchful, dare not interfere\nwithout some cause; and, as the house must needs be kept very quiet\nfor my own purpose of study, noises that are not allowed to reach me\nin the same house, surely will not be able to reach the house next\ndoor.\n\nThe eventful day arrived, and I gathered together my small family, one\nfrom her limited possession of two small rooms, being very pleased to\nhave me with her, which could not otherwise have been. At last we were\nin full possession, and at once proceeded to arrange the furniture,\nand to make the house comfortable. On the second day I began to work\nin earnest, having been unsettled and indisposed for several weeks.\nWhen I came downstairs to dinner, on this second day, I was informed\nthat the landlady had already been there to say that she objected to\nus keeping animals. On being told there was not the least intention of\ndoing the same, she said that she certainly thought such was our\nintention, seeing that we were in possession of wood, and that she\nstrongly objected to any other than that which could be kept indoors.\nThe wood, which had caused all this suspicion, was simply a clothes\nprop and three shelves which had not yet been removed from where they\nwere first placed. I laughed heartily at this unwarranted\ninterference, but the feminine portion of the family strongly resented\nit.\n\nThe third day I continued my work, the others again working on the\ncomfort of this large house; one being outside trimming the\nevergreens, and taking a general pride in our half orchard and half\npark. Ditto the third day, and so on day after day, until the rent\nbecame due. This was the first time for me to take a personal hand in\nmy affairs, and, when the agent called, I thought it more business\nlike to put in an appearance, for the first rent day, at least, seeing\nthat the house was in my name, after which others might attend to it.\nI paid the rent, 9s. 6d.--the house, as I have said, was a fine large\nvilla, and was really worth fifteen or sixteen shillings a week; and\nthis small amount demanded for it, was a mystery at which any sensible\nperson would have sniffed. This agent then gave me a book, with the\nrent entered to my account. After this he handed me a letter, which,\nsaid he, was sent from the office. Not dreaming of its contents, I\nthere and then opened this letter, and to my astonishment saw that it\nwas a notice to quit within one week of that date, at the orders of\nMessrs. H. and B., her solicitors. This notice was a severe blow, for,\nup till then, the place had been unsettled, and we had only been\nenjoying the expectation of future comfort. \"Who, or what does this\nlady object to?\" I asked the agent, with some bitterness. \"I need\nabsolute quiet for my work, and the amount I have done in the past\nweek proves that I have had it. What then has disturbed my landlady,\nthat has not interfered with my work? To make a person suffer the\nexpense, and worse, the worry of moving twice in a few days, should\nnot be done without due consideration, and some definite reason.\" But\nthe agent knew or pretended to know nothing of the affair, and he\nleft me at the door, feeling more shame and mortification than I have\never felt before. There was nothing else to do but to pack up again as\nsoon as possible and to seek fresh quarters, which, after great\ndifficulty, were found.\n\nTo think that I have lived thirty-five years, and not to have known\nthe folly and ill policy of living next door to one's landlady! But\nthis particular landlady is eccentric, can afford to be independent,\nand I verily believe she would not sell a house for even twice its\nworth if she thought the would-be purchaser to be a man incapable of\ntaking charge of property. Her house is more often unoccupied than\nlet, as I have since been told, for the most respectable people cannot\nlive near her. Apparently this is the case, for the house was still\nempty several weeks after I had quit, in spite of its unreasonably low\nrent and the beauty of its surroundings.\n\nA robin came to the back door every morning and was fed. Perhaps this\ntime wasted on the robin might have been better employed in winning\nthe good graces of the landlady.\n\nWhat a pity such an eccentric person should have such power to receive\npeople as tenants for a few days, and then to dismiss them without\nwarning or giving any definite reason. And what a harvest her\nidiosyncrasies must be to her solicitors. They even followed me up and\ndemanded another week's rent, after the expense of moving to the top\nof a high hill and down again, which, up to the present, I have not\npaid. A lawyer would certainly be a lucky man to be allowed control\nover the interests of half a dozen such clients, and he could dress\nhis wife and daughters in silk, and thoroughly educate his sons on his\nmakings. I have been told that she is a deeply religious woman.\nTherefore, although she said in her own heart--\"on no account can\nthese people live in a villa of mine,\" she must have prayed that room\nwould be reserved for us in the many mansions above.\n\nThis chapter should justify itself for the sake of the worldly wisdom\ncontained in the simple words--\"Never live in a house next door to\nyour landlady or landlord;\" which deserves to become a proverb. Many\npeople might not consider this warning necessary, but the hint may be\nuseful to poor travellers like myself who, sick of wandering, would\nsettle down to the peace and quiet of after days.\n\nSuch has been my life, rolling unseen and unnoted, like a dark planet\namong the bright, and at last emitting a few rays of its own to show\nits whereabouts, which were kindly received by many and objected to by\na few, among the latter being my late landlady.\n\nPerhaps I am deceived as to the worth or worthlessness of certain\npeople, but I have given my experience of them without exaggeration,\ndescribing as near as memory makes it possible, things exactly as\nthey occurred. I have made no effort to conceal my gratitude for those\nwho have befriended me, and I have made every effort to conceal\nbitterness against enemies. If I have not succeeded in the latter it\nis with regret, but if I have failed in the former, for that am I more\ntruly and deeply sorry. If I have appeared ignorant of certain matters\nI claim exception from sin through a lack of prejudice which is, after\nall, the only ignorance that can be honestly named with sin.\n\nThese have been my experiences; and if I have not omitted to mention\ntrouble of my own making, for which no one but myself was to blame,\nwhy should I omit the mention of others, whom I blame for hours more\nbitter? People are not to be blamed for their doubts, but that they\nmake no effort to arrive at the truth. However much people of a higher\nstanding may doubt the veracity of certain matters, I have the one\nconsolation to know that many a poor man, who is without talent or\nmeans to make his experiences public, knows what I have written to be\nthe truth. It is but a poor consolation, for such an one is the\nsufferer, and not the supporter, and he is powerless in the hands of a\nstronger body.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp, by\nWilliam H.

For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1001,"split":"train"}
